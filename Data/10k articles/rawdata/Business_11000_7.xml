The '''AXA Equitable Center''' (originally '''The Equitable Tower''' or '''Equitable Center West''') is an American 752-foot (229.3 m)-tall [[skyscraper]], located at 787 [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] between [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st]] and [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Streets]] in [[Manhattan]], New York City.

==Construction and tenants==
It was built in 1985 in the [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] style by [[architect]] [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=116341] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221044756/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=116341 |date=February 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It houses the headquarters for AXA Financial, which consists of a number of subsidiaries of [[France|French]]-based insurance and banking company [[AXA]], such as [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance]] and [[Mutual of New York]]. Other cornerstone tenants include [[BNP Paribas]], [[Stifel]], [[New Mountain Capital]], [[Sidley Austin]] LLP, [[Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher]] LLP, [[UBS]], and [[Citigroup]].

The structure is mainly composed of [[steel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviewoncities.com/buildings/nyc/axacenter.htm |title=Axa Center, New York - Building Info |publisher=Aviewoncities.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facade is of brown [[granite]] in a gridiron pattern with a white background. The tower rises through two setbacks on the north and south sides, indicated by recessed bays on the facade. The plain top has vertical striping, and the east and west sides end in arched windows. The [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable]] boardroom is located at the ends. The building has 54 floors and 142,660m², with a majority of offices.

On February 9, 2016, CALPERS announced that it has purchased the AXA Equitable Center for $1.9 billion.

==Amenities==
The skylighted entrance atrium features a large (22.3 x 10.8 meters) mural by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] called ''[[Mural with Blue Brushstroke]]'', which he completed in 1986. The Atrium at 787 Seventh Avenue is used for after-business and weekend events.

AXA Center is connected to the extensive [[Rockefeller Center]] underground concourse. Pedestrian traffic moves through this tower (via an arched galleria at 7th Avenue), across the open mall (between West 51st and 52nd Streets), and into the eastern Equitable Tower.

The AXA complex includes the AXA Equitable auditorium, with 487 seats, and the AXA Equitable Production Group studio. The auditorium is a versatile meeting and event space. It is often used for events including product launches, corporate meetings, live television premiers and broadcasts, award ceremonies. It has full theater capabilities. The auditorium, along with the AXA Equitable Production Group's full production studio, services many corporate clients in the New York City area.

[[Image:JeanAdrienPhilippe.jpg|thumb| Adrien Philippe, c.1880]]
'''Jean Adrien Philippe''' (16 April 1815, [[La Bazoche-Gouet]], [[Eure-et-Loir]] – 5 January 1894) was a French [[horologist]] and cofounder of [[watchmaker]] [[Patek Philippe &amp; Co.]] of [[Geneva]], Switzerland. 

In 1842 Adrien Philippe invented a mechanism for watches which allowed them to be wound and set by means of a crown rather than a key. His patented invention earned him a Gold Medal at the [[French Industrial Exposition of 1844]] (World's Fair). At the Exhibition, Adrien Philippe first met [[Antoni Patek]] and a year later became head watchmaker at Patek &amp; Co. in Geneva under an agreement that entitled him to one third of all company profits.

Adrien Philippe proved to be very capable at his craft and a product innovator whose value to the firm was such that by 1851 he was made a full partner and the firm began operating as Patek Philippe &amp; Co. In 1863 he published a book in Geneva and Paris on the workings of  pocket watches titled ''Les montres sans clef''.

His partner Antoni Patek died in 1877 and in 1891 the 76-year-old Adrien Philippe handed over the day-to-day management of the business to his son Joseph Emile Philippe and Francois Antoine Conty. 
 
Jean Adrien Philippe died in 1894 and was buried in St-Georges Cemetery in Geneva.

An '''air separation''' plant separates [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric air]] into its primary components, typically [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]], and sometimes also [[argon]] and other rare [[inert gas]]es.

The most common method for air separation is [[fractional distillation]]. Cryogenic air separation units (ASUs) are built to provide nitrogen or oxygen and often co-produce argon.  Other methods such as membrane, [[pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA) and [[Vacuum swing adsorption|vacuum pressure swing adsorption]] (VPSA) are commercially used to separate a single component from ordinary air. High purity [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[argon]] used for [[semiconductor device fabrication]] requires cryogenic distillation. Similarly, the only viable source of the [[rare gases]] [[neon]], [[krypton]], and [[xenon]] is the distillation of air using at least two [[distillation column]]s.

== Cryogenic distillation process==
[[File:Coldbox.JPG|thumb|Distillation column in a cryogenic air separation plant]]
Pure gases can be separated from air by first cooling it until it liquefies, then selectively [[Distillation|distilling]] the components at their various boiling temperatures. The process can produce high purity gases but is energy-intensive. This process was pioneered by [[Carl von Linde]] in the early 20th century and is still used today to produce high purity gases.&lt;ref name=Cool&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcetoday.com/~/media/Documents/TCE/Articles/2010/831/831%20cewctw.pdf|publisher=Institution of Chemical Engineers|date=September 2010|title=Cool Inventions|access-date=2014-01-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113200813/http://www.tcetoday.com/~/media/Documents/TCE/Articles/2010/831/831%20cewctw.pdf|archive-date=2014-01-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve the low distillation temperatures an air separation unit requires a [[refrigeration cycle]] that operates by means of the [[Joule–Thomson effect]], and the cold equipment has to be kept within an [[thermal insulation|insulated]] enclosure (commonly called a "cold box"). The cooling of the gases requires a large amount of energy to make this refrigeration cycle work and is delivered by an air [[Gas compressor|compressor]]. Modern ASUs use [[Turboexpander|expansion turbine]]s for cooling; the output of the expander helps drive the air compressor, for improved efficiency.
The process consists of the following main steps:

# Before compression the air is pre-filtered of dust.
# Air is compressed where the final delivery pressure is determined by recoveries and the [[fluid]] state (gas or liquid) of the products. Typical pressures range between 5 and 10 bar gauge. The air stream may also be compressed to different pressures to enhance the efficiency of the ASU. During compression water is condensed out in inter-stage coolers.
# The process air is generally passed through a [[molecular sieve]] bed, which removes any remaining water vapour, as well as [[carbon dioxide]], which would freeze and plug the cryogenic equipment. Molecular sieves are often designed to remove any gaseous [[hydrocarbons]] from the air, since these can be a problem in the subsequent air distillation that could lead to explosions.&lt;ref&gt;Particulate matter from forest fires caused an explosion in the air separation unit of a [[Gas to Liquid]] plant, see {{Cite journal | last1 = Fainshtein | first1 = V. I. | doi = 10.1007/s10556-007-0018-8 | title = Provision of explosion proof air separation units under contemporary conditions | journal = Chemical and Petroleum Engineering | volume = 43 | pages = 96–101 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The molecular sieves bed must be regenerated. This is done by installing multiple units operating in alternating mode and using the dry co-produced waste gas to desorb the water.
# Process air is passed through an integrated [[heat exchanger]] (usually a [[plate fin heat exchanger]]) and cooled against product (and waste) cryogenic streams. Part of the air liquefies to form a liquid that is enriched in oxygen. The remaining gas is richer in nitrogen and is distilled to almost pure nitrogen (typically &lt; 1ppm) in a high pressure (HP) distillation column. The condenser of this column requires [[refrigeration]] which is obtained from expanding the more oxygen rich stream further across a valve or through an [[Turboexpander|Expander]], (a reverse compressor).
# Alternatively the condenser may be cooled by interchanging heat with a reboiler in a low pressure (LP) distillation column (operating at 1.2-1.3 bar abs.) when the ASU is producing pure oxygen. To minimize the compression cost the combined condenser/reboiler of the HP/LP columns must operate with a temperature difference of only 1-2 K, requiring plate fin brazed aluminium heat exchangers. Typical oxygen purities range in from 97.5% to 99.5% and influences the maximum recovery of oxygen. The refrigeration required for producing liquid products is obtained using the [[Joule–Thomson effect]] in an expander which feeds compressed air directly to the low pressure column. Hence, a certain part of the air is not to be separated and must leave the low pressure column as a waste stream from its upper section.
# Because the boiling point of argon (87.3 K at standard conditions) lies between that of oxygen (90.2 K) and nitrogen (77.4 K), argon builds up in the lower section of the low pressure column. When argon is produced, a vapor side draw is taken from the low pressure column where the argon concentration is highest. It is sent to another column rectifying the argon to the desired purity from which liquid is returned to the same location in the LP column. Use of modern structured packings which have very low pressure drops enable argon with less than 1 ppm impurities. Though argon is present in less to 1% of the incoming, the air argon column requires a significant amount of energy due to the high reflux ratio required (about 30) in the argon column. Cooling of the argon column can be supplied from cold expanded rich liquid or by liquid nitrogen.
# Finally the products produced in gas form are warmed against the incoming air to ambient temperatures. This requires a carefully crafted heat integration that must allow for robustness against disturbances (due to switch over of the molecular sieve beds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vinson | first1 = D. R. | title = Air separation control technology | doi = 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2006.05.038 | journal = Computers &amp; Chemical Engineering | volume = 30 | issue = 10–12 | pages = 1436–1446 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It may also require additional external refrigeration during start-up.

The separated products are sometimes supplied by pipeline to large industrial users near the production plant. Long distance transportation of products is by shipping liquid product for large quantities or as [[Cryogenic storage dewar|dewar flasks]] or [[gas cylinder]]s for small quantities.

[[File:4A sieves.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Bottle of 4Å molecular sieves]]
[[Pressure swing adsorption]] provides separation of oxygen or nitrogen from air without liquefaction. The process operates around ambient temperature; a [[zeolite]] (molecular sponge) is exposed to high pressure air, then the air is released and an adsorbed film of the desired gas is released. The size of compressor is much reduced over a liquefaction plant, and [[portable oxygen concentrator]]s are made in this manner to provide oxygen-enriched air for medical purposes. [[Vacuum swing adsorption]] is a similar process; the product gas is evolved from the zeolite at sub-atmospheric pressure.

[[File:Membrane nitrogen generator.jpg|thumb|right|Membrane nitrogen generator]]
[[membrane gas separation|Membrane technologies]] can provide alternate, lower-energy approaches to air separation. For example, a number of approaches are being explored for oxygen generation. Polymeric membranes operating at ambient or warm temperatures, for example, may be able to produce oxygen-enriched air (25-50% oxygen). Ceramic membranes can provide high-purity oxygen (90% or more) but require higher temperatures (800-900 deg C) to operate. These ceramic membranes include Ion Transport Membranes (ITM) and Oxygen Transport Membranes (OTM). Air Products and Chemicals Inc and Praxair are developing flat ITM and tubular OTM systems, .

Membrane gas separation is used to provide oxygen poor and nitrogen rich gases instead of air to fill the fuel tanks of jet liners, thus greatly reducing the chances of accidental fires and explosions. Conversely, membrane gas separation is currently used to provide oxygen enriched air to pilots flying at great altitudes in aircraft without pressurized cabins.

Oxygen-enriched air can be obtained exploiting the different solubility of oxygen and nitrogen. Oxygen is more soluble than nitrogen in water, so if air is degassed from water, a stream of 35% oxygen can be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Galli| first1 = F | last2 = Comazzi| first2 = A | last3 = Previtali| first3 = D| last4 = Manenti| first4 = F | last5 = Bozzano| first5 = G | last6 = Bianchi| first6 = C.

'''Albert Johan Petersson''' (6 February 1870&lt;ref&gt;Norwegian 1910 census https://www.digitalarkivet.no/en/census/person/pf01036676000724&lt;/ref&gt;-18/19 August 1914&lt;ref&gt;Church book from Odda parish, 1910-1940  https://www.digitalarkivet.no/en/view/267/pg00000001745178&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Swedish chemist, engineer and industrialist. He is most known as the developer of the ''Alby-furnace'' for producing of [[Calcium carbide]] and as the first director of the carbide and cyanamide factories in [[Odda]] in Norway. He was born in [[Landskrona]], Sweden and probably died during a boat trip between Odda and [[Bergen]].

== Family and disappearance ==
Albert Petersson was married to the German born Leonie Witt, daughter of professor {{ill|Otto Nikolaus Witt|sv}} (1853–1915) in [[Berlin]]. Together they had two children, both born in Odda. Claus was born in 1907. On 18 August 1914 Petersson went aboard the fjord steamer D/S ''Ullensvang'' in Odda. The next morning the boat arrived in Bergen and he had disappeared. The cause of his disappearance remains unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6181">An '''applicant tracking system''' ('''ATS''') is a [[application software|software application]] that enables the electronic handling of recruitment needs. An ATS can be implemented or accessed online on an enterprise or small business level, depending on the needs of the company and there is also [[Free and open-source ATS#Free and open-source applicant tracking system software|free and open source ATS]] software available. An ATS is very similar to [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THIS APPLICANT TRACKING SYSTEM IS YOUR CRM|url=https://power.pereless.com/applicant-tracking-system-crm/|publisher=Pereless Systems|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are designed for recruitment tracking purposes. In many cases they filter applications automatically based on given criteria such as keywords, skills, former employers, years of experience and schools attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204624204577178941034941330|title=Your Résumé vs. Oblivion|first=Lauren|last=Weber|date=24 January 2012|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused many to adapt [[Resume parsing|resume optimization]] techniques similar to those used in [[search engine optimization]] when creating and formatting their résumé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Résumé vs. Oblivion|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204624204577178941034941330|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
A dedicated ATS is not uncommon for recruitment specific needs. On the enterprise level it may be offered as a module or functional addition to a [[human resources]] suite or Human Resource Information System (HRIS). The ATS is expanding into [[small and medium enterprises]] through [[open source software|open source]] or [[software as a service]] offerings (SaaS).

The principal function of an ATS is to provide a central location and database for a company's recruitment efforts. ATSs are built to better assist management of resumes and applicant information. Data is either collected from internal applications via the ATS front-end, located on the company website or is extracted from applicants on job boards. The majority of job and resume boards ([[LinkedIn|LinkedIn.com]], [[Monster.com]], [[Yahoo! HotJobs|Hotjobs]], [[CareerBuilder]], [[Indeed.com]]) have partnerships with ATS software providers to provide parsing support and ease of [[data migration]] from one system to another. Newer applicant tracking systems (often referred to as next generation) are platforms as a service whereby the main piece of software has integration points that allow providers of other recruiting technology to plug in seamlessly. The ability of these next generation ATS solutions allows jobs to be posted where the candidate is and not just on job boards. This ability is being referred to as Omnichannel Talent Acquisition.

Recent enhancements include use of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) tools and [[natural language processing]] to facilitate intelligent guided [[semantic search]] capabilities offered through cloud based platforms that allow companies to score and sort resumes with better alignment to the job requirements and descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is Applicant Tracking Software?|url=http://ejobsitesoftware.com/blog/what-is-applicant-tracking-software/|accessdate=25 April 2016|work=ejobsitesoftware}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of ATS, [[Resume Optimization|resume optimization]] techniques and online tools are now used by applicants to increase their chances of landing an interview call.

==Benefits== 
Functionality of an ATS is not limited to data mining and collection; ATS applications in the recruitment industry include the ability to automate the [[recruitment]] process via a defined [[workflow]].

Another benefit of an applicant tracking system is analyzing and coordinating recruitment efforts - managing the conceptual structure known as [[human capital]]. A corporate career site or company specific job board module may be offered, allowing companies to provide opportunities to internal candidates prior to external recruitment efforts. Candidates may be identified via pre-existing data or through information garnered through other means. This data is typically stored for search and retrieval processes. Some systems have expanded offerings that include off-site encrypted resume and data storage, which are often legally required by [[equal opportunity employment]] laws.

Applicant tracking systems may also be referred to as [[talent acquisition and management products]] (TAMP) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Younas|first=Mohammad|title=10 Features Every Career Portal Should Have Today|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/312441|publisher=Entrepreneur|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are often provided via an application service provider or [[software as a service]] (SaaS) model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levinson|first=Meridith|title=New Job Search Service Helps Job Seekers Penetrate Applicant Tracking Systems|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/enterprise/3341530/new-job-search-service-helps-job-seekers-penetrate-applicant-tracking-systems/|publisher=PC Advisor|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The level of service and cost can vary greatly across providers. In the UK and Ireland, Applicant Tracking Systems which are specifically for Agency Recruiters are often referred to as Recruitment Software and this is a term used mainly in the recruitment agency industry (representative bodies include the REC in the UK and the NRF in Ireland). Although proprietary systems dominate the ATS space, there are [[Free and open-source ATS|open-source alternatives]].

As the data held within recruitment software is predominantly personal data, it is often{{vague|date=May 2016}} tightly controlled by [[data protection]] legislation, preventing the data from being held offshore, which frequently places a legal restriction on the use of SaaS offerings.

Mason was also the second-youngest person to ever serve in the US Senate at the age of 28 and 5 months even though the age of requirement for the US Senate in the constitution is 30 years old.

==Early life and education==
He was born at Armisteads in [[Louisa County, Virginia]], graduated from the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1807 and engaged in agricultural pursuits until he became colonel of [[Virginia Volunteers]] in the [[War of 1812]] and subsequently brigadier general of [[Virginia Militia]].

==Political career==
He was elected as a [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of [[William Branch Giles]], [[United States Senate#Qualifications|despite being constitutionally underage for the office]]. Mason served from January 3, 1816, to March 4, 1817. He then moved to [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]], Virginia where he was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the [[15th United States Congress|Fifteenth Congress]] ([[United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 1817|1817]]). It was a bitter campaign that gave rise to several duels: Mason himself was later killed in a duel with his second cousin, [[John Mason McCarty]], at [[Bladensburg Duelling Field]], [[Maryland]], as a result of this campaign. He is buried in the churchyard of the Episcopal Church at [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]], Virginia.&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=PG/&gt;

==Marriage and children==
Mason married on 1 May 1817 to Charlotte Eliza Taylor (died 1846) at Dr. Charles Cocke's in [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]], Virginia.&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=PG/&gt; The couple had one son:&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;&lt;ref name=PG/&gt;

The '''Australian Accounting Standards Board''' ('''AASB''') is an Australian [[Government agency]] that develops and maintains [[Financial statement|financial reporting]] standards applicable to entities in the private and public sectors of the [[Economy of Australia|Australian economy]]. Also, the AASB contributes to the development of global financial reporting standards and facilitates the participation of the Australian community in global standard setting. The AASB's functions and powers are set out in the ''Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001''.&lt;ref name="ootaasb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Publications/2011/Portfolio-Budget-Statements-2011-12/Report/Office-of-the-Australian-Accounting-Standards-Board |title=Office of the Australian Accounting Standards Board |publisher=The Treasury |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424165103/http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Publications/2011/Portfolio-Budget-Statements-2011-12/Report/Office-of-the-Australian-Accounting-Standards-Board |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]]’s (ASIC's) role is to enforce and regulate company and financial services laws to protect Australian consumers, investors and creditors. The AASB uses a conceptual framework to develop and evaluate accounting standards.

==Reporting standards==
The AASB makes Australian Accounting Standards, including Interpretations, to be applied by:&lt;br /&gt;
(a)	entities required by the ''Corporations Act 2001'' to prepare financial reports;&lt;br /&gt;
(b)	governments in preparing financial statements for the whole of government and the General Government Sector (GGS); and&lt;br /&gt;
(c)	entities in the private or public for-profit or not-for-profit sectors that are reporting entities or that prepare general purpose financial statements.

AASB 1053 ''Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards'' establishes a differential reporting framework consisting of two tiers of reporting requirements for preparing general purpose financial statements:&lt;br /&gt;
(a)	Tier 1: Australian Accounting Standards; and&lt;br /&gt;
(b)	Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards – Reduced Disclosure Requirements.

Tier 1 requirements incorporate International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), including Interpretations, issued by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB), with the addition of paragraphs on the applicability of each Standard in the Australian environment.

Publicly accountable (defined in AASB 1053) for-profit private sector entities are required to adopt Tier 1 requirements, and therefore are required to comply with IFRSs.  Furthermore, other for-profit private sector entities complying with Tier 1 requirements will simultaneously comply with IFRSs.  Some other entities complying with Tier 1 requirements will also simultaneously comply with IFRSs.

Tier 2 requirements comprise the recognition, measurement and presentation requirements of Tier 1 but substantially reduced disclosure requirements in comparison with Tier 1.

Australian Accounting Standards also include requirements that are specific to Australian entities.  These requirements may be located in Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate IFRSs or in other Australian Accounting Standards.  In most instances, these requirements are either restricted to the not-for-profit or public sectors or include additional disclosures that address domestic, regulatory or other issues.  These requirements do not prevent publicly accountable for-profit private sector entities from complying with IFRSs.  In developing requirements for public sector entities, the AASB considers the requirements of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs), as issued by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) of the [[International Federation of Accountants]].

==Standard application==
The original series of Australian Accounting Standards (AASs), which was applicable to entities not regulated under the Corporations Law, was issued by the former AASB and the Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (PSASB) of the Australian Accounting Research Foundation (AARF) on behalf of the professional accounting bodies, prior to 2000. The original series of AASB Standards (AASBs), which was applicable to entities regulated under the Corporations Law, was also issued by the former AASB, prior to 2000. Most AASs were superseded by AASBs for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 – as at 1 July 2011, only AAS 25 ''Financial Reporting by Superannuation Plans'' was still operative. All standards now issued by the AASB are labelled AASB Accounting Standards – their application paragraphs specify the types of entities to which they apply. 

Under the Australian ''Corporations Act 2001'', many entities are required to apply Australian Accounting Standards when preparing their financial statements. Some public sector entities are required to apply Australian Accounting Standards under either Commonwealth, state or territory legislation, through specific instructions to preparers or reporting frameworks that set out guidelines or regulations.

Members of [[CPA Australia]], the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia]] and the [[Institute of Public Accountants]] have a professional obligation to take all reasonable steps within their power to ensure that entities with which they are involved comply with Australian Accounting Standards when preparing their general purpose financial statements.

==Adopted standards==
Since 2002, the AASB implemented the broad strategic direction from the Australian Financial Reporting Council (FRC) to adopt [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) standards for financial reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005. In July 2004, the AASB issued a number of standards that apply from 2005, including:

* Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate IASB Standards
* Other AASB Standards supporting the Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate IASB Standards
* Other AASB Standards that apply to certain types of entities

The Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate IASB Standards include:
* AASB 1 ''First-time Adoption of Australian Accounting Standards'', AASB 2 ''Share-based Payment'', etc., which incorporate   IFRS 1 ''First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards'', IFRS 2 ''Share-based Payment'', etc., being the Standards issued by the IASB since 2001
* AASB 101 ''Presentation of Financial Statements'', AASB 102 ''Inventories'', etc., which incorporate IAS 1 ''Presentation of Financial Statements'', IAS 2 ''Inventories'', etc., being the Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), which was the predecessor to the IASB

For reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, the Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate IASB Standards supersede their previous Australian counterparts, if any.

The other AASB Standards supplementing the Australian Accounting Standards that incorporate IASB Standards comprise:
* AASB 1023 ''General Insurance Contracts''
* AASB 1031 ''Materiality''
* AASB 1038 ''Life Insurance Contracts''
* AASB 1048 ''Interpretation and Application of Standards''
* AASB 1053 ''Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards''
* AASB 1054 ''Australian Additional Disclosures''

Current Australian Accounting Standards for which there are no corresponding IASB Standards remain in force beyond 1 January 2005, even though they may be reissued in the future to update them in this new regime. These include:
* AAS 25 ''Financial Reporting by Superannuation Plans''
* AASB 1004 ''Contributions'', AASB 1039 ''Concise Financial Reports'', AASB 1049 ''Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting'', AASB 1050 ''Administered Items'', AASB 1051 ''Land Under Roads'' and AASB 1052 ''Disaggregated Disclosures''

{{Insolvency}}

'''Australian insolvency law''' regulates the position of companies which are in financial distress and are unable to pay or provide for all of their debts or other obligations, and matters ancillary to and arising from financial distress. The law in this area is principally governed by the [[Corporations Act 2001]]. Under [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], the term [[insolvency]] is usually used with reference to companies, and [[bankruptcy]] is used in relation to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsymes.com.au/articles/A-Guide-to-Bankruptcy-Laws|title=A Guide to Bankruptcy Laws|publisher=Fox Symes|date=|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insolvency law in Australia tries to seek an equitable balance between the competing interests of [[debtor]]s, [[creditor]]s and the wider community when debtors are unable to meet their financial obligations. The aim of the legislative provisions is to provide:&lt;ref name=Swaab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/australia/x/79816/Insolvency+Bankruptcy/An+Introduction+To+Insolvency+Law+Part+One|title=Australia: An Introduction To Insolvency Law - Part One|publisher=Mondaq|author=Swaab Attorneys|date=18 May 2009|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an orderly and fair procedure to handle the affairs of insolvent companies;
* to ensure a ''[[pari passu]]'' equal distribution of the assets amongst creditors;
* to ensure claims against the insolvent company are resolved with the minimum of delay and expense;
* to rehabilitate financially distressed companies and businesses where viable;
* to engage with key stakeholders in the resolution of insolvency issues; and
* providing for the examination of insolvent companies and their representatives, and the reasons for their failure.

==Insolvency==

A company, partnership, or trust with multiple trustees, is legally insolvent if it is not able to pay its their debts, as and when they become due and payable.&lt;ref name=95A&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|95A}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Solvency and insolvency are defined so as to be mutually exclusive.&lt;ref name=95A /&gt;

The common law has also established various indicators of insolvency. These indicators include amongst others:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSC|123|2003|litigants=ASIC v Plymin, Elliott &amp; Harrison |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court]] (Vic)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Continuing losses;
* Liquidity ratios below 1;
* Overdue commonwealth and state taxes;
* Poor relationship with bank or other financial institution culminating in an inability to borrow further funds;
* An inability to raise further equity capital; and
* Suppliers placing the company on COD or otherwise demanding ransom payments for continual supply.

===Presumptions of insolvency===

In certain circumstances a debtor may be [[presumption|presumed]] to be insolvent without the need to actually prove financial insolvency. A company will be presumed to be insolvent if, during or after the three months preceding the day on which an application was made for the winding-up of the company, any one of the following six situations occurs.&lt;ref name=459C&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# the company failed to comply with a [[Australian insolvency law#Statutory demands|statutory demand]];
# execution process issued on a judgment in favour of a creditor was returned wholly or partly unsatisfied;
# in relation to a [[floating charge]]:
## a [[receivership|receiver]] was appointed;
## an order was made for the appointment of a receiver;
## a person assumed control of company property; or
## a person was appointed to enter into possession or assume control of company property.

===Statutory demands===

A popular way for a creditor to prove that a company is insolvent is to serve a statutory demand pursuant to section 459E of the Corporations Act.&lt;ref name=Swaab /&gt; Issuing and serving a statutory demand is a relatively simple and inexpensive process when compared against proving actual financial insolvency. Statutory demands are regulated by Part 5.4, Divisions 2 and 3 of the Corporations Act, and the Courts require that the regime be strictly adhered to. Because a company will irrebuttably be presumed to insolvent where a statutory demand is not complied with, the Court requires creditors to ensure that demands are expressed in clear, accurate and unambiguous terms. Even a small error may result in the statutory demand being set aside by the Court. The statute specifies the form of the demand, and requires that the demand must:&lt;ref name=459E&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459E}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# state the debt claimed, or if the demand relates to two or more debts it must specify the total amount of the debts;
# require the debtor company to pay the debt within 21 days;
# must be in writing in the prescribed form (Form 509H&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iknow.cch.com.au/#!/document/atagUio2142696sl395085116/corporations-regulations-form-509h-creditor-s-statutory-demand-for-payment-of-debt|title=Corporations Regulations Form 509H Creditor’s statutory demand for payment of debt|publisher=CCH iKnow|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;); and
# must be signed by or on behalf of the creditor.

====Requirements====

In relation to the debt to which the demand relates:
* the debt must be due and payable - it cannot be contingent, prospective or unliquidated;
* a creditor may not serve a demand at the same time as taking proceedings against the debtors company's directors in relation to the same alleged debt as this would constitute an abuse of process;
The demand must be served on the company by leaving it at its registered office, sending it by post to that office, or delivering a copy of the demand personally to the director of the company.

Upon being served with a valid demand, the debtor may either pay the debt, or secure or compound the debt to the creditor's reasonable satisfaction. Failure to do so within 21 days (unless an extension is granted) will mean that insolvency of the debtor is presumed and the creditor may use that presumption in order to make a winding-up application to the Court.

====Setting aside a statutory demand====

A debtor company can also apply to set aside a statutory demand on various grounds. These include:
* where there is a genuine dispute about the existence of the debt;&lt;ref name=459H1a&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459H}}(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt;
* where the company has an [[set-off (law)|offsetting claim]];&lt;ref name=459H1b&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459H}}(1)(b).&lt;/ref&gt;
* where there is a defect in the demand and substantial injustice will be caused;&lt;ref name=459J1a&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459J}}(1)(a). &lt;/ref&gt; and/or
* where there is some other reason why the demand should be set aside.&lt;ref name=459J1b&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459J}}(1)(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Genuine Dispute =====
Various cases in Australia have decided what a genuine dispute is, and is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://debtrecoveryqld.com.au/setting-aside-statutory-demand/|title=Setting Aside a Statutory Demand in Australia|last=|first=|date=2018-04-15|work=Debt Recovery Qld|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A genuine dispute should:

# Show a plausible contention requiring investigation;&lt;ref name="Eyota"&gt;''Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd'' (1994) 12 [[Australian Company and Security Reports|ACSR]] 785 {{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=12%20ACLC%20669 |title=LawCite}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Be bona fide, genuine and real;&lt;ref name="Eyota"/&gt;
# Be in good faith and show a prima facie plausibility;&lt;ref name="TR Admin"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSCA|70|2008|litigants=TR Administration Pty Ltd v Frank Marchetti &amp; Sons Pty Ltd |date=5 May 2008 |courtname=[[Victorian Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (Vic)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Truly exist in fact, and contain a serious question to be tried;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|618|1993|litigants=Scanhill Pty Ltd v Century 21 Australasia Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1993) 47 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 451 |date=15 December 1993 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Be something more than mere bluster or mere assertion;&lt;ref&gt;''Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Ltd'' (1993) 11 [[Australian Company and Security Reports|ACSR]] 601 {{Cite web|url=https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=11+ACSR+601|title=LawCite}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Be a claim that may have some substance;&lt;ref name="Chadwick Ind"&gt;''Chadwick Industries (South Coast) Pty Ltd v Condensing Vaporisers Pty Ltd'' (1994) 13 [[Australian Company and Security Reports|ACSR]] 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Have a sufficient degree of cogency to be arguable;&lt;ref name="Cgi Info"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|NSWSC|728|2003|litigants=Cgi Information Systems v Apra Consulting Pty Ltd |date=8 August 2003 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of NSW|Supreme Court]] (NSW)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Have objective existence;&lt;ref name="TR Admin"/&gt; and
# Have sufficient factual particularity.&lt;ref name="TR Admin"/&gt;

A genuine dispute should not:

# Be spurious, hypothetical, illusory or misconceived;&lt;ref name="Eyota"/&gt;
# Be plainly vexatious or frivolous;&lt;ref name="Chadwick Ind" /&gt;
# Be so devoid of substance that no further investigation is warranted;&lt;ref name="Cgi Info" /&gt;
# Be merely spurious claim, bluster or assertion;&lt;ref name="TR Admin" /&gt; and
# Be merely fanciful or futile.&lt;ref name="TR Admin" /&gt;

===== Offsetting Claim =====
You may also set aside a statutory demand if you have an offsetting claim.&lt;ref name="459H1b" /&gt;

Section 459H(1)(b) of the ''Corporations Act 2001'' (Cth)&lt;ref name="s459H"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459H}} Determination of application where there is a dispute or offsetting claim.&lt;/ref&gt; says:

''(1) This section applies where, on an application under section 459G, the Court is satisfied…''

''(b) that the company has an offsetting claim.''

Then goes on to define an offsetting claim to mean:

''“offsetting claim” means a genuine claim that the company has against the respondent by way of counterclaim, set-off or cross-demand (even if it does not arise out of the same transaction or circumstances as a debt to which the demand relates).''

This means that any claim that you have against the person/company issuing the demand, can be used to set aside the demand.  Especially if the offsetting claim means that the offset total of the demand drops below the statutory minimum.

===== Defect in the Demand Causing Substantial Injustice =====
A statutory demand can also be set aside pursuant to section 459J(1)(a)&lt;ref name="s459J"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459J}}Setting aside demand on other grounds.&lt;/ref&gt; if ''because of a defect in the demand, substantial injustice will be caused unless the demand is set aside.''

Section 9 of the ''Corporations Act''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|9}} Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; defines the word “'''''defect'''''” to mean:

''“defect“, in relation to a statutory demand, includes:''

''(a)  an irregularity; and''

''(b)  a misstatement of an amount or total; and''

''(c)  a misdescription of a debt or other matter; and''

''(d)  a misdescription of a person or entity.''

However, a simple defect is not enough to allow the demand to be set aside, it must cause substantial injustice.

There are a number of cases in Australia which have decided what a defect in a demand which will cause substantial injustice is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://debtrecoveryqld.com.au/setting-aside-statutory-demand-complete-guide/|title=Setting Aside Statutory Demand|last=|first=|date=2018-05-20|work=Debt Recovery Qld|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some examples of this are:

* Misstatement of a Debt, Amount, or Total;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|NSWSC|1406|2007|litigants=LSI Australia v LSI Holdings |date=6 December 2007 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of NSW|Supreme Court]] (NSW)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|NSWSC|1139|2005|litigants=Condor Asset Management Ltd v Excelsior Eastern Ltd |date=10 November 2005 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of NSW|Supreme Court]] (NSW)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Incorrect Interest Calculation;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|FCA|589|1993|litigants=Topfelt Pty Limited v State Bank of New South Wales Limited |parallelcite=(1993) 47 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 226 |date=7 December 1993 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Defect in the Names of the Parties;&lt;ref&gt;''Re Macro Constructions Pty Ltd'' [1994] 2 Qd R 31&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Scandon Pty Ltd v Dome Supplies Pty Ltd'' (1995) 17 [[Australian Company and Security Reports|ACSR]] 662&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also cases in Australia which have decided that certain defects in the demand do not cause substantial injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://debtrecoveryqld.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Setting-Aside-Statutory-Demand-Free-eBook.pdf|title=Setting Aside a Statutory Demand|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some examples are:

==== Effect ====
If a company fails to satisfy a statutory demand, or have it set aside, then it is presumed to be insolvent.&lt;ref name="459C" /&gt; The company requires leave of the court to before it can challenge the debt in opposing an application to wind up the company.&lt;ref name="459s"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|459S}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the presumption is that the company has to prove that it is solvent.&lt;ref name="459C" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|728|1999|litigants=Ace Contractors &amp; Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bankruptcy Term===

On the 19th October 2017 The Australian Federal Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017B00235/Explanatory%20Memorandum/Text|title= Bankruptcy Amendment (Enterprise Incentives) Bill 2017|date= October 19, 2017|website= [[Parliament of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a bill is to reduce the period of bankruptcy from three years to one year. According to this bill, after one year, a person will not be required to disclose his status as bankrupt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bankruptcyexperts.com.au/proposed-changes-to-the-bankruptcy-act-term-reduced-from-3-years-to-1-year/|title= Proposed Changes to the Bankruptcy Act – Term Reduced from 3 Years to 1 Year.|date= December 8, 2017|website= Bankruptcy Expert}}&lt;/ref&gt;	.
Furthermore, it states that after one year, a bankrupt would be able to travel without prior permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/caution-over-bankruptcy-and-insolvency-law-changes-20151207-glhb65.html|title= Caution over bankruptcy and insolvency law changes|date= December 8, 2015|newspaper= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liquidation==

{{Main|Liquidation}}

[[Liquidation]] is the process whereby the assets of a company are collected and realised by a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]], and the proceeds are subsequently applied to discharge all relevant debts and liabilities in accordance with the priorities set by law. Any balance which may remain after paying the costs and expenses of winding-up is then distributed among the members according to their respective rights and interests.

A company may be wound up on either a voluntary basis or on a compulsory basis.

===Types of liquidation===

There are three different types of winding-up:
* members' voluntary winding-up
* creditors' voluntary winding-up
* compulsory winding-up

====Members' voluntary winding-up====

A members' voluntary winding-up is not technically an insolvency process. It is a voluntary liquidation entered into by the members where the company is not insolvent. The process is initiated by a [[special resolution]] of the company,&lt;ref name=s491&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|491}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the creditors have no direct involvement and are repaid in full. The directors are required to give a declaration as to the solvency of the company which must be filed with the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC).

Where a liquidator who is appointed pursuant to a members' voluntary winding-up subsequently determines that the company is in fact insolvent in his opinion (contrary to the solvency declaration made by the [[board of directors]]), then the liquidator must either (a) apply to the Court for the company to be wound-up on an insolvent basis, (b) appoint an [[administration (law)|administrator]] to the company, or (c) convene a meeting of creditors. If a meeting of the creditors is convened, then from the time of the meeting the winding-up will be treated as a [[Australian insolvency law#Creditors' voluntary winding-up|creditors' voluntary winding-up]].

====Creditors' voluntary winding-up====

A creditors' voluntary winding-up is also initiated by the members but (in contrast to a members' voluntary winding-up) where it has been determined that the company is insolvent. The process normally occurs where the [[board of directors]] has determined that the company is insolvent and then recommended to the members that it be wound up. However, [[Australian insolvency law#Members' voluntary winding-up|as noted above]], it may also be initiated by a liquidator was originally appointed pursuant to members voluntary winding-up where the liquidator has subsequently formed the opinion that the company is actually insolvent.

====Compulsory winding-up====

A compulsory liquidation is usually the result of an action taken by one or more creditors of an insolvent company. Compulsory liquidation is a statutory procedure which enables a person to apply to the Court for an order that the affairs of a company be wound-up. A number of different people have ''[[locus standi]]'' to initiate compulsory liquidation proceedings, including not only the company's creditors (who are the most common applicants), but also the company itself, the company's members, the liquidator, ASIC and (in respect of a general insurance company) the [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]] (APRA). But in most cases compulsory liquidation will normally be commenced by one or more creditors.

===Commencement of winding-up proceedings===

In a compulsory winding up, the day on which the relevant Court order is made will constitute the date of the commencement of the winding up. The date on which the application to wind up the company was filed is called the ''relation-back day''.
Whether the liquidation process is initiated by an order of the Court or through a creditors' voluntary winding up, a liquidator will be appointed to administer the winding up of the affairs of the company.

===The liquidator===

{{Main|Liquidator (law)}}

The liquidator is the principal officer of the company who is appointed to conduct the winding-up process. Where the company is insolvent, the liquidation will invariable be an accountant who is an insolvency professional.

====Appointment====

In a compulsory winding up the Court will appoint the liquidator to the company. Generally it will act upon the nomination of the party making the application. In a voluntary winding up, the liquidator will be appointed by the members or creditors of a company. Liquidators are required to be members of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia]] or [[CPA Australia]]. They must be an independent person and be seen to be fully independent.

====Role of the liquidator====

The liquidator's role has been described as a hybrid role with elements of fiduciary trustee, agent, officer of the corporation and in some instances officer of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|1384|1996|litigants=Sydloq Pty Ltd v TG Kotselas Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1996) 65 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 234 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The liquidator owes [[fiduciary]] duties to the company, its creditors and members. The liquidator is required to act honestly, fairly and impartially at all times, and must avoid any [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]].

Liquidators should exercise their powers and discharge their duties with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if they were a director or officer of a corporation if the corporation's circumstances and occupied the office held by, and had the same responsibilities within the corporation as, the director or officer.

Upon the appointment of the liquidator, all of the powers of the directors are suspended and the company itself will cease to carry on business except to the extent that the liquidator believes it will assist the beneficial disposal of the business. The liquidator will take over operation of the company and can deal with the property of the company.   
The functions of the liquidator are to:
* wind-up the affairs of the company;
* ascertain and recover the property of the company;
* to distribute the company's assets equitably among its creditors; and
* to examine the circumstances which precipitated the liquidation and which may reveal improper dispositions of property and criminal offences.

====Duties of the liquidator====

Liquidators are subject to a number of duties, including [[fiduciary duty|fiduciary duties]] to the company itself. In relation to the administration of the liquidation the statutory duties of the liquidator include:
* To ascertain and take possession of all the assets of the company. The liquidator is empowered to take into custody all property which the company is or appears to be entitled to.
* To preserve the assets of the company by taking an inventory, insuring the assets, investing funds wisely and defending any claims initiated against the company to recover assets or claim for damages;
* A duty to liquidate and realise the value of the assets for the benefit of the company;
* A duty to report and investigate on the affairs of the company, including settling a list of contributories and ascertaining the liabilities of the company;
* Administrative duties which require certain documents to be lodged with governmental bodies, and the keeping of accurate accounts and records of all matters relating to the liquidation.

===Company property===

The liquidator is entitled to all the assets belonging to the company at the commencement of the winding up. But:
* the liquidator is not entitled to property which is subject to a valid [[security interest]], or which is held on [[trust law|trust]] for another person;
* the liquidator is not entitled to goods in the company's possession that the company holds as [[bailment|bailee]]&lt;ref&gt;Subject to any claim the company may have to a [[lien]] over the goods.&lt;/ref&gt; or which are subject to a valid [[retention of title clause]]; and
* aside from current assets, the liquidator can also recover property or money from other persons, or seek to enhance the pool of estates by pursuing claims on behalf of the company.

Any property of the company which is disposed of after the deemed commencement of winding-up (other than by the liquidator in the exercise of his or her powers) is [[void (law)|void]] unless validated by the Court.&lt;ref name=s468&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|468}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collateral for security====

Any property of the company which is subject to a valid security interest is not considered part of the insolvent estate, and the insolvency process does not prevent a secured creditor from enforcing their rights over the relevant collateral.&lt;ref name=s471C&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|471C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Onerous property====

The liquidator also has power to disclaim any onerous property or contracts of the company in liquidation with the leave of the Court.&lt;ref name=s568&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|568}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Any damages due to a counterparty to a contract which has been disclaimed may be proved as a debt in the winding-up.

===Claims===

Any creditor wishing to make a claim with respect to a debt due from the company must formally make and prove the claim in accordance with the regulations.&lt;ref name=s553D&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|553D}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[secured creditor]] will not normally make a claim in the liquidation unless there is a shortfall in the collateral provided by the insolvent company.&lt;ref name=s554E&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|554E}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if a secured creditor wishes to do so, it may release its [[security interest|security]], and claim in the winding-up for the full amount.&lt;ref name=s554E /&gt;

====Insolvency set-off====

Where there are mutual debts between the company and any of its creditors when the company goes into winding-up then those debts will [[set-off (law)|set-off]].&lt;ref name=s553C&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|553C}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However a creditor is not entitled to claim the benefit of insolvency set-off if, at the time of giving or receiving credit to or from the company, the creditor had notice of the fact that the company was insolvent. Mutual debts are only capable of being set-off if each party is the beneficial owner of each debt (set-off is not available where the debt is owed to one person as agent for another, or where the debt has been assigned or secured in favour of a third party).

====Priority of claims====

Where any of the assets of the company are subject to a valid [[security interest]] (not being a floating charge), those claims will normally be enforced against the assets outside of (and in priority to) the liquidation process. The priority of unsecured claims to the assets of the company in a liquidation is regulated by section 556 of the Corporations Act.&lt;ref name=s556&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|556}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The rules are very detailed, but broadly they provide that:
# Properly incurred liquidation expenses are paid out first; followed by
# If the Court so order, the costs of the winding-up application;
# Any claims of an administrator to be indemnified;
# Expenses properly incurred by any "relevant authority" (as defined);
# Deferred expenses;
# Wages, superannuation contributions and superannuation guarantee charges;
# Claims for injury compensation;
# Amounts due because of an industrial instrument;
# Retrenchment payments payable to employees; and then
# Ordinary unsecured creditors.

All ordinary unsecured creditors ranks equally between themselves,&lt;ref name=s555&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|555}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and within each rank of [[Preferential creditor|preferred creditors]], the preferred creditors rank equally.&lt;ref name=s559&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|559}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the relevant provisions: &lt;br /&gt;
"''Deferred expenses''" means, broadly, the fees and expenses properly incurred by a relevant authority.&lt;br /&gt;
"''Relevant authority''" means a liquidator or provisional liquidator, administrator or administrator of a deed of company arrangement.&lt;br /&gt;
"''Retrenchment payment''" means an amount payable to the employee by virtue of an industrial instrument in respect of the termination of the employee's employment by the company. &lt;br /&gt;
"''Industrial instrument''" is defined in section 9&lt;ref&gt;{{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the statute as (a) a contract of employment; or (b) a law, award, determination or agreement relating to terms or conditions of employment.

==Restructuring options==

If the company is potentially salvageable with a realistic prospect of surviving its [[financial distress|financial difficulties]], a company may seek to enter into a non-liquidation arrangement. The two principal types are voluntary administration and deeds of company arrangement. These forms of administration are considered when the debtor company is insolvent or likely to become insolvent. Unlike receivership (which is usually initiated by a [[secured creditor]]) these two forms of administration are normally initiated by the company itself.

Voluntary administrations and deeds of company arrangement are regulated under Part 5.3A of the Corporations Act. The purpose is to provide for the business, property and affairs of an insolvent company to be administered in a way that:
# maximises the chances of the company, or as much as possible of its business, continuing in existence; or
# if it is not possible for the company or business to survive as a going concern, would result in a better return for the company's creditors and members than would result from an immediate winding up of the company.

===Voluntary administration===

{{Main|Administration (law)}}

Voluntary administration commences from the time when an administrator is appointed,&lt;ref name=s437A&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|437A}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and usually ends either upon the execution by the company of a deed of company arrangement or a resolution by the creditors that the company should be wound up.

An administrator may be appointed by:
* the company;&lt;ref name=s436A&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|436A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* a liquidator or provisional liquidator;&lt;ref name=s436B&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|436B}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or
* a chargee of the whole, or substantially the whole, of the company's property where the company is not already being wound up.&lt;ref name=s436A/&gt;
Upon their appointment an administrator is obliged to lodge a notice of appointment with ASIC in order to provide notification that the company is under external administration. The administrator must also publish a notice of appointment in a newspaper. Once an administrator is appointed, any use of the company's name must be followed by the words "(Administrator Appointed)".

Where the company is to survive as a going concern the aim of the voluntary administration process is the entering into of a deed of company arrangement. If a deed of company arrangement is executed it will lead to another administration, governed by the terms of the deed of company arrangement . Although both administrations are dealt with under the same part of the statute, the two are actually separate processes.

====The administrator====

An administrator must be a registered liquidator who gives consent in writing to accept their appointment. Various persons are disqualified from acting as a company's administrator, including creditors with an interest in the company over $5000, a director, secretary or employee of the company, a director, secretary or employee of a company that is a mortgagee to the company's property, or an auditor of the company.

The core role of the administrator is outlined in the legislation.&lt;ref name=s437A /&gt; Whilst a company is under administration, the administrator:
# has control of the company's business, property and affairs; and
# may carry on that business and manage that property and those affairs; and
# may terminate or dispose of all or part of that business, and may dispose of any of that property; and
# may perform any function, and exercise any powers, that the company or any of its officers could perform or exercise if the company were not under administration.

The administrator is also required to investigate the affairs of the company and consider any possible causes of action and report to creditors. As soon as practicable after the administration of a company begins, the administrator must:&lt;ref name=s438A&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|438A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# investigate the company's business, property, affairs and financial circumstances; and
# form an opinion about each of the following matters:
## whether it would be in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to execute a deed of company arrangement;
## whether it would be in the creditors' interests for the administration to end;
## whether it would be in the creditors' interests for the company to be wound up.

In carrying out these tasks the administrator acts as agent of the company.&lt;ref name=s437B&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|437B}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the administrator has broad powers to deal with the company's property and carry on the company's business. The administrator is also entitled to the company's books and the officers of the company have an obligation to hand over any books in their possession. The directors are also required to provide the administrator with a statement about the company's business, property, affairs and financial circumstances within one week of the administrator being appointed, and must assist the administrator whenever reasonably required.

====Effect of voluntary administration====

The principal effects of voluntary administration are:
* the company's business, property and affairs come under the control of the administrator:&lt;ref name=s437A /&gt;
* the company's officers lose the right to use their authority and can only exercise that authority with the written approval of the administrator;
* the appointment of an administrator leads to a [[Moratorium (law)|statutory moratorium]] meaning that legal proceedings, winding-up proceedings and execution against company property cannot be commenced or continued by creditors without written consent of the administrator or leave of the Court;
* the retention of the company's employees is ultimately within the administrator's discretion, and the administrator may terminate employees without incurring any personal liability;
* contracts with a company under administration are not automatically terminated - the appointment of an administrator does not reflect an intention on the part of the company to repudiate contracts already entered into, nor does it necessarily constitute a breach or repudiation of a continuing contract. This will however, depend upon the terms of the particular contract. Unlike a liquidator, an administrator does not have any statutory power to disclaim onerous contracts;
* while the company is in administration, the owner or lessor of property that is used or occupied by, or is in the possession of, the company cannot take possession of that property or otherwise recover it - except where a supplier of perishable property is entitled to recover those goods under section 441G or where the owner/lessor can obtain the administrator's written consent or the leave of the Court under;&lt;ref name=s440C&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|440C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* creditors who have supplied goods to a company pursuant to a contract which includes a retention of title clause, and the company then goes into administration, are often unable to recover the goods because of the restriction of section 440C provided the company is using the goods;
* where property is being used or occupied by the company in administration, but belongs to someone else, the administrator is only able to dispose of it in the ordinary course of business with the consent of the owner or with leave of the Court:&lt;ref name=s440C /&gt;
** creditors are required to obtain leave of the Court to enforce guarantees against directors, their spouses, de facto spouses or their relatives;&lt;ref name=s440J&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|440J}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and
** during the period of administration, the administrator controls all financial and other dealings of the company.

If the administrator, in good faith, makes a payment or enters into a transaction, that act is valid and effectual for the purposes of the Corporations Act and cannot be set aside in a subsequent winding up of the company.&lt;ref name=s451C&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|451C}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deeds of company arrangement===

A deed of company arrangement is also a type of administration. But unlike a [[scheme of arrangement]] it is not a standalone process. A deed of company arrangement is broadly a compromise agreement entered into between the company and its creditors that follows on from a voluntary administration, much like a [[company voluntary arrangement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/insolvency/insolvency-for-employees/employees-deed-of-company-arrangement/|title=What is a deed of company arrangement?|publisher=ASIC|date=|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a deed of company arrangement is agreed to by creditors, it will normally result in a successful financial restructuring of the company. Alternatively, less commonly, the deed of company arrangement sometimes simply operates as a way to maximise the benefits of the creditors over the short term. During the operation of the deed of company arrangement a company normally continues to trade, however any debts incurred after the execution of the deed of company arrangement are not covered by the deed, and are treated as expenses of the administration process.

An administrator of the deed of company arrangement must be appointed, and this will usually be the former administrator from the voluntary administration continuing in office. The Corporations Act permits a great deal flexibility in relation to the deed of company arrangement. The deed of company arrangement may involve a simple moratorium for a fixed period, or a composition of creditors' claims whereby creditors agree to accept a [[cram down]], or a plan to pay creditors in deferred instalments, or some combination of these things.

====Advantages====

The main aim of a deed of company arrangement is to try and produce a better outcome for all parties than would result upon a liquidation. There are a number of advantages which can potentially arise from a consensual deed of company arrangement.&lt;ref name=Swaab /&gt; The principal advantage for the company is normally that it can continue to trade during the deed of company arrangement period and may be able to survive its financial difficulties. In addition, for the company and its directors:
* the officers will not be seen as officers of a company that is in liquidation;
* creditors of the company will no longer place pressure for payment on the company;
* because the company is not in liquidation, [[insolvent trading]] claims against the directors cannot be commenced;
* the company may be able to carry forward tax benefits as deductions against any future earnings; and
* the company may redevelop its business during the deed of company arrangement period.
The primary benefit for the company's creditors is that there is a potential for a better dividend than what the creditors would otherwise receive if the company were to be broken up and wound-up by a liquidator. Other potential advantages of a deed of company arrangement for the company's creditors are:
* a dividend under a deed of company arrangement may be received more quickly than if the company was being wound up, and third parties may be willing to contribute funds to the company which would not otherwise be available;
* the directors, related companies and some creditors may be willing to defer or waive their claims under a deed of company arrangement, increasing the funds available to the deed of company arrangement creditors;
* the creditors of a company may elect to retain the company as a customer;
* deed of company arrangement administrators can be selected based on relevant industry experience; and
* the administrator of a deed of company arrangement will not have the power to seek recovery with respect to [[Australian insolvency law#Avoidance of transactions|voidable transactions]].

====Effect of a deed of company arrangement====

Once a deed of company arrangement is executed, the administration of the company ends and the moratorium restrictions that apply to creditors come to an end and are replaced by the deed of company arrangement's moratorium provisions.

The deed of company arrangement binds the deed administrator, the company and its officers and the members of the company and releases the company from its debts to the extent provided by the deed of company arrangement. If a creditor fails to lodge a proof of debt in the administration of a deed of company arrangement, that creditor may be prevented from participating in any distribution of the fund created by deed of company arrangement.

The company is bound by the terms of the deed of company arrangement throughout the term of its operation.&lt;ref name=s444D&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|444D}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The company will also be required to change all public documents by inserting the words "(Subject To A Deed Of Company Arrangement)" after its name. In exceptional circumstances the Court may order that this requirement may be dispensed with.&lt;ref name=s447A&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|447A}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the voluntary administration of the company ends and the deed of company arrangement comes into effect, and the powers of the directors are resurrected. However, the deed of company arrangement binds the directors of the company. The deed of company arrangement also binds all creditors in so far as they possess any claims arising before the effective date referred to in the deed of company arrangement. Creditor's claims are normally compromised to some degree under the terms of a deed of company arrangement in order to preserve the company as a [[going concern]]. Accordingly, a creditor who is bound by a deed of company arrangement will be unable to subsequently apply for a winding-up order against the company in respect of those claims.

[[Secured creditor]]s can continue to deal with their own security and are generally not bound by the terms of a deed of company arrangement unless they have expressly consented to it.

==Avoidance of transactions==

The liquidator of a company may in some cases seek to claw back the benefit of transactions which the company undertook during the "twilight period" prior to the commencement of the winding-up. These are generally referred to as "voidable transactions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/DeakinLawRw/1995/3.pdf|title=Challenging fraudulent transactions and unfair loans as voidable pre-liquidation transactions|author=Andrew Keay}} (1995) 2(1) Deakin Law Review 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the division is to protect "the interests of unsecured creditors which might otherwise be prejudiced by a company disposing of assets or incurring liabilities or entering into unrealistic loans shortly before winding up".

There are several different types of voidable transactions:&lt;ref name=s588FE&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Unfair preference]]s&lt;ref name=s588FA&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FA}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[undervalue transaction|Uncommercial transactions]];&lt;ref name=s588FB&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FB}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fraudulent transactions;&lt;ref name=s588FE5&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FE(5).|publisher=AUSTLII|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unfair loans;&lt;ref name=s588FD&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FD}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Unreasonable director-related transactions.&lt;ref name=s588FDA&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FDA}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfair preferences and uncommercial transactions are collectively referred to as "insolvent transactions" because of the requirement that the company must have been insolvent and the time they were entered into, or caused the company to become insolvent.

===Insolvent transactions===

Insolvent transactions are transactions entered into by a company whilst insolvent, or transactions entered into by the company the result of which caused the company to become insolvent. An insolvent transaction may be voidable when one of the following conditions apply:
# It was entered into during the 6-month period immediately before the relation back day or during the period between the relation back day and the winding up;
# it was an uncommercial transaction entered into during 2 years prior to relation back day;
# it was a related entity transaction during the 4-year period prior to the relation back day;
# it involved a situation where the company was a party to an unfair preference or uncommercial transaction in order to defeat, delay or interfere with the rights of any or all of its creditors and the transaction was entered into during the ten years immediately prior to the relation back day.

There are two categories of insolvent transactions: unfair preferences,&lt;ref name=s588FA /&gt; and uncommercial transactions.&lt;ref name=s588FB /&gt;

====Unfair preference====
A transaction is an unfair preference if the company and the creditor are parties to the transaction and the transaction results in the creditor receiving from the company, in relation to an unsecured debt owed to the creditor, a greater amount than it would have received in relation to the debt in a winding up of the company. 
The liquidator will be required to prove the various elements in order to retrieve the monies paid out by the company. These include that:&lt;ref name=s588FA /&gt;
# there was a transaction between the company and a creditor;
# the transaction was an insolvent transaction (that is the company was insolvent at the time of the transaction or the transaction caused the company to become insolvent);
# the transaction occurred within six months of the relation back date or within four years of the relation back date if the transaction is with a related entity; and
# the creditor received more than it would have in a winding-up of the company.

If a transaction is held to constitute an unfair preference, the recipient will be required to repay the benefit received from the company to the liquidator for general distribution to all creditors.

====Uncommercial transactions====

An uncommercial transaction is an insolvent transaction (that is the company was insolvent at the time of the transaction or the transaction caused the company to become insolvent) that a reasonable person in the place of the company would not have entered into, taking into account:&lt;ref name=s588FB /&gt;
* the relevant benefits and the detriments to the company; and
* the respective benefits to the other parties involved and any other relevant matter.

It is not necessary for the liquidator to demonstrate that the transaction was between the company and a creditor. The transaction can be between the company and any party. An uncommercial transaction can be voided if it was entered into during the 2 years prior to the relation-back day, or 4 years prior to the relation-back day if a related entity is a party to the transaction.

====Fraudulent transactions====

Where it is not possible to categorise transactions as unfair preferences or uncommercial transactions, they may still be voidable even if entered into outside of the time periods usually applied to such transactions. This will be the case where transactions were entered into by the company for the purpose of defeating, delaying or interfering with the rights of creditors during the 10 years prior to the relation back day.&lt;ref name=s588FE5 /&gt;

===Unfair loans===

A liquidator may seek to avoid an unfair loan where the loan or loans were subject to interest or charges that are extortionate.&lt;ref name=s588FD /&gt; In determining whether a loan is unfair, the Court will look at such things as the risk assumed by the company in lending, the value of any security in respect of the loan and the term of the loan. The unfair loan provisions do not require that the transaction be an insolvent transaction.

===Unreasonable director-related transactions===

A liquidator may seek to reclaim unreasonable payments made by companies to directors prior to liquidation, for example, by way of an excessive bonus. This provision extends to payments made to "close associates" of any director, conveyances, transfers, other dispositions of property, the issue of securities, and the incurring of an obligation to enter into these obligations.&lt;ref name=s588FDA /&gt;

A transaction will be deemed an unreasonable director-related transaction if a reasonable person in the company's circumstances would not have entered into the transaction.

===Defences===

The Court may not make an order against a party where it would materially prejudice a right or interest of a person who is able to bring themselves within the protective provision. Where the person defending the liquidator's claim was not a party to the voidable transaction, the protective provision requires that they must prove that they did not receive a benefit as a result of the transaction, or if a benefit was received, that it was received in [[good faith]] and at the time there was no reasonable grounds for suspecting company insolvent. But if the person defending the liquidator's claim was a party to the voidable transaction then they must prove:&lt;ref name=s588FGB&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588FGB}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# that they became a party to the transaction in good faith;
# that at the time they became a party to the transaction, they had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the company was insolvent at that time or would become insolvent;
# that a reasonable person in the recipient's circumstances would have had no such grounds for so suspecting; and
# that valuable consideration was provided or that they changed their position in reliance on the transaction.

==Director liability==

The liquidator also has a duty to investigate the company's officers and to determine whether there may be any liability for anything done by them prior to the company going into liquidation. Where the directors or officers have been guilty of either insolvent trading or misfeasance, this may provide the basis for financial claims against them, which the liquidator can use to swell the assets available for distribution to the creditors.

The Corporations Act codifies several duties into sections 180 to 183 of the statute.

|}

===Insolvent trading===
{{Main|Trading whilst insolvent}}

A director of an insolvent company may be personally liable for insolvent trading if: &lt;ref name=s588G&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|588G}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# he or she was director of the company at the time when the company incurred a debt;
# the company was insolvent at the time when the debt was incurred, or became insolvent as a result of the incurring of the debt;
# there were reasonable grounds for believing that the company was insolvent or would become insolvent; and
# a reasonable person in the position of a director in the company's circumstances would have been aware of the company's insolvency.

If a director is found to be in breach, then they may also be subject to a civil penalty application by ASIC. ASIC may also seek compensation orders on behalf of the creditors in addition to the liquidator.

===Common law duties===

The breach of [[common law]] [[Board of directors#Duties|directors' duties]] may enable a liquidator to recover property from a director, or may give the liquidator a right to an account of profits. If a director removes or misuses company property, this would ordinarily be a breach of their duty of good faith, and may render the transaction [[voidable]]. Accordingly, the liquidator may attempt to recover the property from the director, who is deemed to hold it on [[constructive trust]] for the company. A director who breaches the duty to use reasonable care and diligence may also be liable for damages if the company suffered loss as a result of the breach.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd]]'' [1983] Ch 258&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil penalties===

A person who contravenes duties set out in sections 180-183 of the Corporations Act may also be made subject to a civil penalty order of up to AU$200,000 upon the application of ASIC. The success rate of ASIC when seeking civil penalties is extremely high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=789116067090117098117107108092011010100085029034061049102013104014084117066126082110057122057000109057009023082124083076089124033036011060059098097126068079067110091051040022022015117082126005124013111074007108096026094082090066083104082111120098&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;TYPE=2|title=The Use of Civil Sanctions for Breaches of Corporate Law|publisher=[[Monash University]]|author=Michelle Welsh|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director may be ordered to pay compensation to the company in addition if the Court is satisfied that the corporation has suffered some loss as a result of the director's breach.

===Criminal liability===

Officers of a company who breach sections 180-183 of the Corporations Act may also be [[criminal law|criminally liable]] if: &lt;ref name=s184&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ca2001172|Corporations Act 2001|184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# there is [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] or intentional dishonesty and powers are not exercised in good faith in the best interests of the company;
# there is, in the use of directors' position, an element of dishonesty and either intention or recklessness in obtaining a gain or causing the company a detriment; or
# directors use the information that they receive dishonestly with either the intention of gaining an advantage or causing the company to suffer a detriment, or acting recklessly as to whether they might gain an advantage or cause the company a detriment.

[[File:Cardiff city centre skyscrapers.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Stadium House, Cardiff|Stadium House]] (left) and South Gate House (right), in the west of the city centre]]

'''Cardiff city centre''' ({{lang-cy|Canol Dinas Caerdydd}}) is the [[city centre]] and [[central business district]] of [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. The area is tightly bound by the [[River Taff]] to the west, the Civic Centre to the north and railway lines and two railway stations &amp;ndash; [[Cardiff Central railway station|Central]] and [[Cardiff Queen Street|Queen Street]] &amp;ndash; to the south and east respectively. Cardiff became a city in 1905.

The city centre in Cardiff consists of principal shopping streets: Queen Street, St. Mary's Street and the Hayes, as well as large [[shopping centre]]s, and [[List of shopping arcades in Cardiff|numerous arcades]] and lanes that house some smaller, specialized shops and boutiques.

The city centre has undergone a number of redevelopment projects, including [[St. David's Centre#St. David's 2|St. David's 2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://stdavidscardiff.com/About-us/Development

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which extended the shopping district southwards, creating 100 new stores and a flagship [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]], the only branch in Wales and the largest outside [[London]]. Compared to nearby cities, the new St David's Centre has more retail space than the whole of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] or [[Swansea]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 2008&amp;ndash;9, the annual [[wikt:footfall|footfall]] of shoppers was 55 million, and is expected to have risen to 66 million by 2009&amp;ndash;10.{{update needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==

{{main|History of Cardiff}}
[[Image:John Speed's map of Cardiff 1610.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Speed]]'s 1610 map of Cardiff]]
Cardiff was granted city status by [[Edward VII]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/27849/pages/7248

| accessdate = {{date| 9 mar 2013}}
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, planners described Cardiff city centre as "worn out, inconvenient, drab and dangerous". The centre had escaped the extensive wartime bomb damage inflicted on other cities, so little redevelopment took place in the 1950s and 1960s. The Buchanan Plan of 1964 envisaged a highly ambitious extended city centre, crossed with urban motorways. The council scrapped the proposed motorway network and focused on the small commercial core of the city; its proposed redevelopment scheme, in partnership with a private developer, would have seen almost all of the city centre (except St Mary Street and Working Street) demolished, replaced by [[Modern architecture|modernist]] office towers of up to 21 storeys and pedestrianised decks linking [[multi-storey car park|multi{{nbhyph}}storey car park]]s to covered shopping malls.&lt;ref name="Hooper"&gt;{{cite book

| year        = 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the legal agreement to implement 'Centreplan 70' was signed, the 1973 property crash had made it unviable. However, one legacy of the scheme was the future segregation of office and retail development, with the west end of Newport Road as the principal office area with secondary concentrations on Churchill Way, Greyfriars Road and Westgate Street.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

Development in the 1970s and 80s was more piecemeal than envisaged in Centreplan, with the building of the St. David's Centre and St David's Hall, new multi{{nbhyph}}storey car parks, and the grant{{nbhyph}}supported construction of the 14{{nbhyph}}storey Holiday Inn (now the Marriott) and World Trade Centre (now the Cardiff International Arena), which gave a fillip to the city's conference and exhibition business. In the mid&amp;ndash;1980s developers returned to Queen Street, creating three medium{{nbhyph}}sized malls, helping it to become one of the best performing shopping streets in the country in terms of footfall and rental levels.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

In the 1990s the Mill Lane cafe quarter was developed in partnership with the [[Welsh Development Agency]], a pedestrian forecourt was created for the refurbished Central railway station, a new walkway was constructed alongside the Taff and the [[Millennium Stadium]] was built on the site of the [[Cardiff_Arms_Park#National_Stadium|National Stadium]] and [[Wales Empire Pool|Empire Pool]]. The latter became, according to official publicists, one of the icons of Cardiff's new image.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

==Castle Quarter==

The [[Castle Quarter]] includes some of [[List of shopping arcades in Cardiff|Cardiff's Victorian and Edwardian arcades]]: Castle Arcade, High Street Arcade and Duke Street Arcade, and principal shopping streets: [[St. Mary Street/High Street|St Mary Street, High Street]], Castle Street and Duke Street.

Development of the area began in February 2010 and is expected to be completed by July 2011. [[Cardiff Council]] says that work to create the Castle Quarter as a pedestrian friendly environment for High Street and St Mary Street is designed to enhance the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Castle Street/Duke Street/Kingsway===

[[File:Duke Street Arcade Cardiff.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Duke Street Arcade]]
'''Castle Street''' follows on from Cowbridge Road East from [[Canton, Cardiff|Canton]] and begins after Cardiff Bridge, over the [[River Taff]]. It becomes '''Duke Street''' after the junction with High Street before turning north and  becoming '''Kingsway''', leading to [[Cathays Park|Cardiff Civic Centre]]. From west to east, streets that begin from the southern side of this stretch are Westgate Street, Womanby Street, High Street (St Marys Street), St Johns Street (The Hayes), Queen Street and Greyfriars Road. [[Cardiff Castle]] and [[Bute Park]] dominate the northern side of the street. On the southern side are pubs, bars, retail and hotel units. Castle Arcade and Duke Street Arcades begin from this stretch.

===St. Mary Street and High Street===

{{main|St. Mary Street/High Street}}
[[Image:St. Mary Street, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|St. Mary Street south end]]
[[File:Womanby Street - Cardiff - geograph.org.uk - 1575663.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Womanby Street looking south]]
'''St. Mary Street''' ({{lang-cy|Heol Eglwys Fair}}) and '''High Street''' ({{lang-cy|Heol Fawr}}). The former street is named after the 11th century church of St. Mary, the largest in Cardiff until it was destroyed by the [[Bristol Channel floods, 1607|Bristol Channel floods]] of 1607. Today the stretch of road is the home of a number of [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s, [[night club]]s and [[restaurant]]s, as well as branches of many major [[bank]]s. Also fronting onto the street is [[Howells (department store)|Howells]] department store, which stretches from just after [[Cardiff Central Market]] to the corner of Wharton Street.  From August 2007 the street was closed to private vehicles, leaving only buses, cycles and taxis allowed to access the whole street.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The street is usually closed to all traffic every Friday and Saturday night to allow the efflux from [[night club]]s and [[pub]]s located in that part of the street to clear. It is also closed when major events take place such as at the [[Millennium Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Womanby Street===

Womanby Street is one of Cardiff's oldest streets. It is known for its small, independent live music venues and is home to [[Clwb Ifor Bach]]. It is accessed from Castle Street, between Westgate Street and High Street.

==Queen Street and vicinity==

[[File:Summer on Queen Street - Cardiff - geograph.org.uk - 1363923.jpg|thumb|left|Queen Street]]
'''Queen Street''' ({{lang-cy|Heol y Frenhines}}) is the main thoroughfare in the city, now wholly pedestrianised. Most of Queen Street, from the castle moat to Dumfries Place, used to be called '''Crockherbtown''' (Crockherbtown Lane can still be found off Park Place),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Street was pedestrianised in 1974 and is served by [[Cardiff Queen Street railway station]] on Station Terrace. It meets Dumfries Place/Newport Road at its eastern end, Duke Street/Castle Street at its western, and Park Place approximately halfway along. Further down Park Place is the [[New Theatre (Cardiff)|New Theatre]], a local landmark is Principality House, head office of the [[Principality Building Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the north running parallel is Greyfriars Road, referring to the site of an old monastery, a traditional office location that has recently seen conversion to bars, apartments and hotels as offices move to the new business parks on the edge of the city, or to the better connected southern end of the city centre.

==Cathays Park (Civic Centre)==
{{main|Cathays Park}}

[[File:Cathays Park, Cardiff.png|thumb|Cathays Park]]
Cathays Park is the [[civic centre]] of Cardiff. The [[Edwardian]] architecture of [[Cardiff City Hall]], [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum and Gallery of Wales]], [[Cardiff University]], [[Cardiff Crown Court]], and the administrative headquarters of the [[Welsh Government]] dominate the area. Behind the City Hall is the [[Welsh National War Memorial]]. [[Bute Park]] also dominates the northwest of the area, running behind [[Cardiff Castle]] along the River Taff southward to Westgate Street and northward to [[Gabalfa]]. Cardiff's Winter Wonderland [[ice rink]] and fairground returns to the front lawn of the City Hall every winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Boulevard de [[Nantes]] and [[Stuttgart]]er Strasse, named after Cardiff's twin cities, run through the southern end and act as a northern bypass of parallel Queen Street for the A4161. To the west, it is connected to Kingsway (leading to Castle Street and St Mary Street), and Dumfries Place/ Newport Road to the east. Park Place runs north to south through the area, linking it to the A470 in the north and Queen Street in the south

==Eastern city centre==

===Dumfries Place/Newport Road===

[[File:Queen Street junction with Dumfries Place.JPG|thumb|left|The junction of Newport Road, Queen Street and Dumfries Place]]
'''Dumfries Place''' is named after the [[Earl of Dumfries]], a courtesy title given to the [[Marquis of Bute]]'s eldest son.

[[Newport Road]], the major road leading east from Queen Street towards the neighbouring city of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], has been one of the prime office locations of central Cardiff since the 1960s. Some of the original buildings have been converted from office use to residential (e.g. The Aspect, Admiral House&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=967
| title      = Admiral House  {{font|size=90%|text = Also known as Forty Newport Road}}

| accessdate = {{date| 9 mar 2013}}
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hotel use including the [[Holland House, Cardiff|Mercure Holland House]]. Occupancy of the remaining commercial property has increased, reflecting a shortage of office space in the city and there is now little scope for further conversion. Newport Road is also home to several buildings owned by [[Cardiff University]], and Shand House, occupied by [[Cardiff Institute for the Blind]].

Newport Road is also the site for the [[Cardiff Royal Infirmary]], now providing long term care and rehabilitation. The hospital once housed 500 beds and provided the main A&amp;E service for Cardiff before the [[University Hospital of Wales]] took over these functions.

[[File:The big squeeze^ - geograph.org.uk - 1186370.jpg|thumb|right|The eastern side of Churchill Way]]

===Churchill Way===

'''Churchill Way''' runs parallel to the west of Station Terrace (Cardiff Queen Street station) and joins Queen Street in the north and Bute Terrace in the south. The [[Capitol Centre]] is on the corner with Queen Street. Further along this road are office and modern apartment developments. The Cardiff office of the [[Driving Standards Agency]], former [[Centrica|British Gas]] offices in [[Helmont House]] (now a [[Premier Inn]]), and an [[Hotel Ibis|Ibis]] Hotel are located on this street.  The Cardiff office of the DSA subsequently closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Southwestern city centre==

===Wood Street===
[[File:Wood Street, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|Wood Street]]
'''Wood Street''' is the main access point for [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central railway]] and [[Cardiff Central bus station|Central bus]] stations, with the latter undergoing reconstruction since early 2008. The street also has bus stands running along the length of the street as well. Travelling westwards along this street are the [[Millennium Stadium]], Millennium Plaza (with bars, night clubs, comedy clubs and a [[Vue Cinemas|Vue cinema]]), [[Stadium House]], ''Media Wales'' (offices of the [[South Wales Echo]] and [[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]) and Southgate House, (which houses among other organisations the Cardiff offices for the Armed Forces).

===Central Square===
{{main|Central Square, Cardiff}}
'''Central Square''' is a large public space between Wood Street and Cardiff Central railway station. It includes Cardiff bus station. In 2012 plans were announced to redevelop the square and rename it 'Capital Square'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Westgate Street===
[[File:Westgate_Street_(south)_Cardiff.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The southern end of Westgate Street towards the perpendicular Wood Street]]

'''Westgate Street''' runs parallel just west of St Marys Street for about half of the latter's length, linked by several alleys and lanes. Linking Castle Street and Wood Street, [[Cardiff Arms Park]] and the [[Millennium Stadium]] dominate its western side, whereas pubs and bars and hotels dominate its eastern side, with the [[Angel Hotel, Cardiff|Angel Hotel]] at the north end and the [[Royal Hotel, Cardiff|Royal Hotel]] to the south.

==The Hayes==
{{main|The Hayes}}
[[Image:Cardiff arcade.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Morgan Arcade]]
[[File:Caroline Street Cardiff.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Caroline Street looking south]]
The Hayes ({{lang-cy|Yr Ais}}) is where the [[department store]] [[Howells (department store)|Howells]], Bwyty Hayes Island Snack Bar, [[Spillers Records]], [[St David's Hall]], and elegant [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s are found. At the northern end is Cardiff's Grade II* listed [[Old Library, Cardiff|Old Library building]] (location of the [[Cardiff Story]] people's museum).

The Hayes used to be home to [[David Morgan (department store)|David Morgan department store]], an historic local landmark that dominated the shop fronts on the western side of The Hayes. Since its closure in 2005, the Grade&amp;nbsp;I{{nbhyph}}listed David Morgan Buildings have been subdivided into several retail units, and the upper floors converted into 56 luxury apartments. The exterior of the building received a comprehensive refurbishment, with the street clock being reinstated and the façade being restored to its original design, following many alterations since its construction in the late 1800s.

The eastern side of the Hayes is fronted by the new [[St. David's Centre#St. David's|St. Davids 2]] shopping centre. Prior to this it was home to Oxford Arcade, a post war construction that dated quickly and was underused given its central location.

[[File:Alliance Cardiff.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Alliance (sculpture)|Alliance]] in front of Cardiff Central Library]]
The southern end features the [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis department store]] and the new [[Cardiff Central Library]], which opened in March 2009. The previous Central Library closed in 2006 to make way for the construction of the St. David's 2 shopping centre and was located a few hundred yards north-east on Bridge Street.

As part of the St Davids 2 development, the Hayes was pedestrianised and repaved. A new public square was created at its southern end with a large, interactive public artwork as its centrepiece called [[Alliance (sculpture)|Alliance]], a {{convert|25|m|ft|0}} high sculpture consisting of a large stainless steel and enamelled metal ring and an arrow column, which was initially meant to feature lights that would rise and fall with the tide.

===Caroline Street===
{{main|Caroline Street (Cardiff)}}
Caroline Street is a pedestrianised link between St Mary Street and The Hayes. The street has been a host to all kinds of stores but has seen a surge in chip and kebab shops, and as such is commonly known as ''Chip Lane'' or ''Chip Alley''. Around 2003, the north side of the street was redeveloped after the demolition of the old [[S A Brain|Brains]] Brewery. In its place were luxury flats encircling the [[Old Brewery Quarter]], where new shops, bars and restaurants were erected.  The pavement on the street was re{{nbhyph}}tiled as part of this development.

==Southeastern city centre==

===Callaghan Square===
{{main|Callaghan Square}}

This development, built in 1999, extends the central business district south of the mainline railway. Eventually the main development will include approximately 850,000 square feet (77,000 m²) of office space and other uses, of which approximately 350,000 square feet (33,000 m²) is complete (with the largest occupiers being Eversheds and British Gas). Further phases are unlikely to be built on a speculative basis. The initial masterplan suggest that the final phase, yet to be commenced, will also include hotel and residential use. Nearby offices on Tresillian Way (housing The AA, and Lloyds TSB Black Horse finance amongst others) plus further potential developments have turned the area relatively quickly into one of the largest office locations in Central Cardiff. Within a few years total office space in the area will exceed 1 million square feet (90,000 m²).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[File:Atrium, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Atrium]]

===Custom House Street/Bute Terrace/Adam Street===

These two roads have traditionally formed the southern and southeastern boundaries of the [[central business district]] of Cardiff, and in the 2000s have seen a great deal of new development. Recent developments such as the 23{{nbhyph}}storey [[Altolusso]] apartment complex, and the Big Sleep Hotel were set to be joined by (from west to east), a new 11{{nbhyph}}storey office building (on the site of the 120-year-old Central Hotel &amp;ndash; destroyed by fire in early 2003;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Meridian Gate, Cardiff|Meridian Gate]] development (consisting of an 11{{nbhyph}}storey apartment block and a 21{{nbhyph}}storey Radisson SAS Hotel); a new John Lewis department store as part of the St. David's 2 shopping expansion; Harlech Court (consisting of apartments and a rooftop restaurant); the [[University of South Wales]]'s [[Atrium (Cardiff)|ATRiuM]] campus (which opened in 2007) along with the 21{{nbhyph}}storey [[Tŷ Pont Haearn]] student halls; and 3 further residential towers (of up to 13 storeys) with lower floor retail and commercial use.

==Access==

From the north, North Road (A470) meets the city centre at the junction with Castle Street and Boulevard de Nantes, with the latter route forming a northern and eastern by{{nbhyph}}pass, meeting Newport Road (A4161) and then Callaghan Square, just south of the city centre.

From the west, the centre is accessed from Castle Street (A4161), Wood Street and Penarth Road (A4160), with St. Mary's Street connecting the three, but is restricted to no{{nbhyph}}car traffic. Penarth Road terminates at Callaghan Square.

From the south, Lloyd George Avenue (A470), Bute Street and the Central Link (A4234) originate from [[Cardiff Bay]] and meet the city centre at Callaghan Square.

==Transport in the city centre==
{{see also|Transport in Cardiff}}

===Bus===
The vast majority of [[Cardiff Bus]] services run to or through the city centre, approaching from the west along either Tudor Street or Westgate Street, from the north along North Road or Newport Road, from the east along Newport Road and from the south along Callaghan Square. Most services circle the city centre, creating a "bus box". Some terminate or pass through [[Cardiff Central bus station]], off Wood Street, which is currently being redeveloped. Other major interchanges include The Hayes, Dumfries Place, Westgate Street, Greyfriars Road and St. Mary Street, with taxi stands being located next to most of these.

The [[Baycar]] service circles the city centre every 10 minutes before continuing to [[Cardiff Bay]].

===Rail===
[[File:CardiffCentral-front-02.jpg|thumb|right|Cardiff Central station]]
[[File:Cardiff Queen Street station April 2009.JPG|thumb|right|Cardiff Queen Street station]]

The city centre is served by two railway stations. [[Cardiff Queen Street]] is in the east of the centre and is the city's main hub for urban services to the rest of Cardiff, its [[South Wales Valleys|valleys]] and the [[Vale of Glamorgan]]. [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]], located in the south of the city centre, is the largest station in the city and one of the busiest in the United Kingdom, focusing on mainline services. Central railway station is located next to Central bus station forming an interchange.

[[Cathays railway station]], [[Grangetown railway station]] and [[Ninian Park railway station]] are all within {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} of the centre serving edges of the city centre.

===Road===
The [[A470 road|A470]] bypasses the centre to the east running southbound to [[Cardiff Bay]] and northbound to [[Cardiff North (geographical area)|North Cardiff]], [[Pontypridd]], [[Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Brecon]]. The A470 road meets the [[A4232 road|A4232]] at [[Cardiff Bay]], leading to [[Culverhouse Cross]] and the [[M4 motorway]], and also meets the [[A48 road|A48 Camarthen&amp;ndash;Gloucester road]] at [[Gabalfa]], north of the centre.

Some city centre taxis can be hailed. They are usually, but not always, black with a white bonnet or hackney carriages.

===Water===
The [[Cardiff Waterbus]] has stops at Cardiff Castle and Taff Mead Embankment, next to the [[Millennium Stadium]], with services to [[Cardiff Bay]].

===Cycle===
A cycle hire system, similar to those in other large cities, launched in September 2009, and included 70 bikes and 35 hire points (initially 7) around the centre and the south of the city. The cycle hire system was shut down in 2012.

{{Accounting}}
'''Chartered Certified Accountant''' (designatory letters '''ACCA''' or '''FCCA''') is a protected designation awarded by the '''[[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]]''' ('''ACCA'''). The Association is UK based and was historically an organisation of [[British qualified accountants]], however it is now a global body for professional accountants with 208,000 qualified members allowed to use the designation and 503,000 students globally.  Support offices/centres exist over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/uk/en/about-us.html|title=Global body for professional accountants - Accountancy - About Us|website=www.accaglobal.com|publisher=Association of Chartered Certified Accountants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''Chartered Certified Accountant'' was introduced in 1996.  Prior to that date, [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] members were known as ''Certified Accountant.''  It is still permissible for an ACCA member to use this term. Members of ACCA with post-qualification experience of more than five years and have completed the required continued professional development are designated Fellows, and use the designatory letters FCCA in place of ACCA.

The term ''Chartered'' refers to the [[Royal Charter]] granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the [[United Kingdom]].

Chartered Certified Accountants work in all fields of business and finance. Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies.

Since ''Chartered Certified Accountant'' is a legally protected term, individuals who describe themselves as such must be members of ACCA. If they carry out public practice engagements, they must comply with additional regulations such as holding a practising certificate, being [[professional indemnity insurance|insured]] against any possible liability claims and submitting to inspections.

==Syllabus==
The current syllabus is made up of 13 examinations, although some exemptions are available. The papers are split into two levels:
* The Applied Knowledge level: 3 examinations consisting of 
** AB - Accountant in Business
** MA - [[Management Accounting]]
** FA - [[Financial Accounting]]
* The Applied Skills level: 6 examinations consisting of 
** LW - Corporate and Business Law
** PM - Performance Management
** TX - [[Taxation]]
** FR - [[Financial Reporting]]
** AA - [[Audit]] and Assurance
** FM - [[Finance|Financial Management]]
* The Strategic Professional level - 6 examinations consisting of 
** Two compulsory papers:
*** SBL - Strategic Business Leader
*** SBR - Strategic Business Reporting
** Four optional papers, of which two must be selected:
*** AFM - Advanced Financial Management
*** APM - Advanced Performance Management
*** ATX - Advanced Taxation
*** AAA - Advanced Audit and Assurance

'''Chen Jianqiang''' is the Chairman of [[Springland International]]. 
According to Hurun Report's China Rich List 2013, he is the 401st richest person in China. Chen has net worth of $780 million.{{what|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurun.net/EN/HuList.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; He is a first-generation entrepreneur and his wealth is self made.&lt;ref name=" Profile " /&gt;

==Background==
Chen obtained his [[MBA]] from [[China Europe International Business School]].&lt;ref name=" Profile " /&gt;

==Business==
Chen is into retail business and owns [[Springland International]]. Springland operates supermarkets and department stores in [[Hong Kong]]. The company went public in Oct 2010.&lt;ref name=" Profile " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" IPO "&gt;{{cite news|title=IPO|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=Jan 2012|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/04/springland-ipo-idUSTOE69303F20101004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate on inclusion in Forbes list==
As per Forbes, Chen's wealth was calculated based on public reports filed with the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]]. The reports talked about Chen's holding as well as his disposal of approximately 29 million shares towards over-allotment option. Chen's attorney objected to Chen's inclusion in the Forbes list. He however did not refute the information and instead explained that Chen disagrees with the HKSE's requirement to disclose holdings. Chen's is still a part of the Forbes list of richest people.&lt;ref name=" Profile " /&gt;

'''Christine Loh Kung-wai''', [[Silver Bauhinia Star|SBS]], [[Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Justice of the Peace#Hong Kong|JP]] (born 1 February 1956), is a former [[Hong Kong]] Legislative Councillor, founder and CEO of [[Civic Exchange]], founder of the [[Citizens Party (Hong Kong)|Citizens Party]], and founder of [[Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor]]. From 2012 to 2017, she was Under Secretary for the [[Secretary for the Environment|Environment]] in the government of [[CY Leung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enb.gov.hk/en/about_us/organisation/index.html|title=Organisation|accessdate=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2017book&gt;[https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/09/17/ex-environment-deputy-christine-loh-update-revise-book-communist-party-hong-kong/ Ex-environment deputy Christine Loh to update and revise book on Communist Party in Hong Kong], HKFP, by Kris Cheng, 17 Sept 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Until her appointment as Undersecretary for the Environment, Loh was CEO of Civic Exchange, the Hong Kong [[think tank]] that she co-founded in 2000. She was named "Woman of the Year for 2006" by ''Hong Kong Business''.&lt;ref name="HKDF-profile"/&gt; She has worked in many areas, including law, business, politics, media and the [[non-profit sector]], but is best known as a leading voice in public policy in Hong Kong, particularly in promoting democracy and environmental protection. She has long been associated with the campaign to save Hong Kong's Harbour from excessive land reclamation and overdevelopment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In 2017, following the end of her official role, she is an adjunct professor in the Division of [[Sustainability and environmental management|Environment and Sustainability]] at the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]], and is said to be revising her book ''Underground Front: The Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong'', first published in 2010.&lt;ref name=2017book/&gt;

==Education and professional career==
Loh attended [[St. Paul's Convent School]] in Causeway Bay, and later [[Island School]] in Mid-levels, Hong Kong. She then went to [[Bedford High School (Bedfordshire)|Bedford High School]] in the UK. She later attended the [[University of Hull]], [[City University of Hong Kong]] (Masters of Law in Chinese &amp; Comparative Law) and the [[University of Hull]] (Doctor of Law, honoris causa) and was trained as a lawyer but she worked for 12 years as a commodities trader (1980–1991), rising to become managing director and later director of business development. Loh spent fourteen years in the commercial world, holding top regional posts in commodities trading at Philipp Brothers and [[Phibro]] Energy – the physical commodities trading arms of US multinational Salomon, Inc. (now Citicorp) — before joining a Hong Kong company (CIM Co.), where she headed the special projects division between 1992 and 1994. In April 2006, she was elected by shareholders of the [[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing]] (HKEx) to be a director of the company.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkbookcity.com/showbook2.php?serial_no=44699 At the Epicentre: Hong Kong and the SARS Outbreak – 中文書店: 香港書城網上書店 Hong Kong Book City]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="HKDF-profile"/&gt;

== Political career ==
Loh was appointed to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] (LegCo) in 1992. In 1995 and 1998 she ran in two direct elections and won by large margins.&lt;ref name=HKDF-newsletter/&gt; She co-founded, in 1995, the [[Society for Protection of the Harbour]] and was responsible for creating and sponsoring the historic [[Protection of the Harbour Ordinance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdeclips.com/en/hongkong/fullstory.html?id=75707 New talents to boost govt] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130118205228/http://www.cdeclips.com/en/hongkong/fullstory.html?id=75707 |date=18 January 2013 }}, China Daily, 13 Sept 2012&lt;/ref&gt; While part of the democratic camp in LegCo, she took a less confrontational approach than some, preferring to keep open lines of communication with the so-called pro-China camp. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In 2000, she and Lisa Hopkinson co-founded a Hong Kong-based non-profit [[think tank]], [[Civic Exchange]], and once again entered the political spotlight, but outside of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|LegCo]]. She resigned as its chief executive on 11 September 2012 upon her appointment as Undersecretary for the Environment in the [[First term of CY Leung as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|administration of CY Leung]], taking up her new post the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=24901&amp;icid=3&amp;d_str=20120719 "Former lawmaker Loh receives govt appointment"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130107171138/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=24901&amp;icid=3&amp;d_str=20120719 |date=7 January 2013 }}. ''The Standard'', 11 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, she resigned from all her positions in other non-profit organisations, academic affiliations, and non-executive directorships in commercial firms.

She left the government at the end of [[CY Leung]]'s term, in July 2017.&lt;ref name=2017book/&gt;

The '''Common Fisheries Policy''' ('''CFP''') is the [[fishery|fisheries]] policy of the [[European Union]] (EU).  It sets quotas for which [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] are allowed to catch each type of fish, as well as encouraging the [[fishing industry]] by various market interventions. In 2004 it had a budget of €931&amp;nbsp;million, approximately 0.75% of the [[Budget of the European Union|EU budget]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

When it came into force, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] formally enshrined fisheries ''conservation'' policy as one of the handful of "exclusive competences" reserved for the European Union, to be decided by [[Qualified Majority Voting]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 3 (d) of the [http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st06/st06655.en08.pdf Consolidated Treaty on the functioning of the European Union ]&lt;/ref&gt; However, general fisheries policy remains a "shared competence" of the Union and its member states.&lt;ref&gt;Article 4 (d) of the Consolidated Treaty on the functioning of the European Union&lt;/ref&gt; Thus decisions are still made primarily by the [[Council of the European Union]], as was the case previously.

The common fisheries policy was created to manage fish stock for the European Union as a whole. Article 38 of the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]], which created the [[European Communities]] (now [[European Union]]), stated that there should be a common policy for fisheries.

At 25&amp;nbsp;million square kilometres, it is the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/outermost_regions_en.htm EU Glossary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909000258/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/outermost_regions_en.htm |date=9 September 2010 }} at europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Importance of fishing==
Fishing is a relatively unimportant economic activity within the EU. It contributes generally less than 1% to gross national product. In 2007 the fisheries sector employed 141,110 fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/documentation/publications/pcp_en.pdf Employment in the fisheries sector (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 6.4&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of fish were caught by EU countries.&lt;ref name="Main world producers 2007"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/documentation/publications/pcp_en.pdf Main world producers (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; The EU fleet has 97,000 vessels of varying sizes. [[Fish farm]]ing produced a further 1&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of fish and shellfish and employed another 85,000 people. The shortfall between fish catches and demand varies, but there is an EU trade deficit in processed fish products of €3&amp;nbsp;billion.
[[File:Fisheryexpenditure2004.png|right|250px]]

The combined EU fishing fleets land about 6 million tonnes of fish per year,&lt;ref name="Main world producers 2007"/&gt; of which about 700,000 tonnes are from [[Exclusive economic zone|UK waters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK fishermen may not win waters back after Brexit, EU memo reveals|author=Daniel Boffey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/15/uk-fishermen-may-not-win-waters-back-after-brexit-eu-memo-reveals|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 February 2017|accessdate=3 July 2017|quote=Source: House of Lords, NAFC Marine Centre, University of the Highlands and Islands.|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's share of the overall EU fishing catch in 2014 was 752,000 tonnes, the second largest catch of any country in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-pinching-our-fish |title=Is the EU ‘pinching our fish’? |last=Milne |first=Claire |date=21 June 2017 |website=fullfact.org/ |publisher=Full Fact|access-date=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proportion is determined by the [[Fisheries Convention|London Fisheries Convention of 1964]] and by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy.

In [[Fraserburgh]], Scotland, the fishing industry creates 40% of employment and a similar figure in [[Peterhead]]. They are the EU's largest fishing ports and home to the [[pelagic]] vessel fleet. It is often in areas where other employment opportunities are limited. For this reason, community funds have been made available to fishing as a means of encouraging regional development.

The market for fish and fish products has changed in recent years. Supermarkets are now the main buyers of fish and expect steady supplies. Fresh fish sales have fallen, but demand for processed fish and prepared meals has grown. Despite this, employment in [[fish processing]] has been falling, with 60% of fish consumed in the EU coming from elsewhere. This is partly due to improvements in the ability to transport fresh fish internationally.  Competitiveness of the EU fishing industry has been affected by overcapacity and shortages of fish to catch.

===Aquaculture===
Fish farming is the fastest growing area of world food production. In 1995 it produced {{frac|1|3}} in value of world production of fish and shellfish. The main species in the EU are trout, salmon, mussels and oysters, but interest has been shown in sea bass, sea bream and turbot. Community support began in 1971 for inland fish farming, but was extended to other areas in the late 1970s. EU support covers similar areas to other land installations, but with additional concerns of technical and environmental problems caused by introducing major fish concentrations where farms are built. The industry suffers problems due to fluctuating demand for farmed fish.

==Mechanisms of the CFP==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
The CFP currently has four components:
*Regulation of production, quality, grading, packaging and labelling
*Encouraging producer organisations intended to protect fishermen from sudden market changes
*Setting minimum fish prices and financing buying up of unsold fish
*Set rules for trade with non-EU countries

===Total allowable catch (TAC)===
The CFP sets quotas for how much of each species can be caught in a certain [http://geo.ices.dk/viewer.php?add_layers=ices_ref:ices_areas ICES Statistical Area] or groups of areas on a yearly or two-yearly basis. Each country is given a quota based upon the total available (Total Allowable Catch, TAC) and their traditional share (percentage). TACs are fixed annually by the Council of Ministers. They consider proposals drawn up by the European Commission, which consults its own scientific advisers (Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee of Fisheries, STECF). STECF generally provides its advice to the European Commission taking account of the work conducted by the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]] (ICES). The Council of Ministers furthermore (when relevant) takes account of the views of non-EU fishing nations and the advice coming directly from ICES, which is independent of EU institutions. After quotas are fixed by the Council of Ministers, each EU member state is responsible for policing its own quota. Countries distribute their quotas among fishermen using different systems.

===Fishing controls===
The Basic Regulation sets the common principles for the EU management, under which each Member State can use different management approaches as licences, limited entry or individual fishing quota. Catches and landings must be recorded. Regulations cover the kind of fishing gear that may be used. Areas may be closed from fishing to allow stocks to recover.

A [[Minimum landing size|minimum size]] for catch led to fishermen dumping dead fish that were too small to land legally, so a minimum mesh size was introduced, which let small fish escape to replenish stocks. Choice of mesh is complicated, because mature fish of different species are naturally different sizes and require different nets.

===Structural policy and onshore fishing industry===
In 1977 an aid programme was introduced to improve the fish processing industries. This includes such things as fish filleting, salting, drying, smoking, cooking, freezing and canning.  It was intended to indirectly assist the catching industry.  There has been an attempt to introduce new technologies to the sector, improve hygiene conditions, and also fund conversions of fish processing factories to other uses.

Each country is given a target for the size of its fleet. Funding is available to assist modernisation of boats and installations, but also to buy-out fishermen to reduce the fleet size. Money is available for advertising campaigns to encourage consumption of fish species that are not over-fished, or are unfamiliar to the public. Also, grants are available to assist the industry in improving product quality and managing quotas.

===Producer organisations===
[[File:Fishing Trawler.jpg|thumb|left|The EU's fishing fleet numbers 88,000 – the second largest in the world – and can fish freely across the European Union, catching nearly six million metric tonnes a year&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp_en.htm About the Common Fisheries Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/fisheries_sector_en.htm About the Common Fisheries Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225054421/http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/fisheries_sector_en.htm |date=25 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are now more than 160 producer organisations (PO) in the EU. These are voluntary organisations set up by fishermen or fish farmers to assist in selling their product. Their members must include a minimum percentage of vessels in that sector, not discriminate in terms of nationality or location of their members within the EU, and must comply with other EU regulations. Organisations are required to develop plans to adjust fish catches to market demand. They may require non-members fishing in the same areas to follow the same restrictions as members.

They are empowered to take produce out of the market if prices fall below levels set by the Council of Ministers and receive compensation from the EU. Levels of compensation are set such that price falls as the amount of fish involved increases. Fish stocks may be stored and later returned to the market, or sold for animal feed. Buying-up of stocks must only be to cover occasional surpluses.

Tuna fishermen have a scheme where surplus stock is not bought up, but fishermen receive direct compensation if their income falls.

==International relations==
Fishing rights to fisheries outside the EU were significantly reduced when [[exclusive economic zone]]s were [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|defined]] in 1982. The EU has negotiated agreements to recover some of these fishing grounds in return for alternative trading rights with the EU. External trade is now affected by the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), regulated by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).

===Areas of co-operation===
Responsibility for fisheries in the [[Baltic sea]] was shared with the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBFC), to which the EU belonged until 1 January 2006.  The Commission ceased to exist on 1 January 2007.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/external_relations/rfos/ibsfc_en.htm European Commission – Fisheries – The International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBSFC)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312230134/http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/external_relations/rfos/ibsfc_en.htm |date=12 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Mediterranean fishing is confined to a 12-mile (22-km) strip considered territorial waters. The EU belongs to the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna, which also makes recommendations for Mediterranean tuna. In 1994 conservation regulations were introduced banning certain fishing methods. In 1997 targets were set for tuna catches.

==Compliance==
Enforcement is the responsibility of member states, but there is a community level inspection service to ensure that member states enforce the rules within their own country. Member states are also under an obligation to ensure that their vessels observe EU agreements when operating outside the EU. The regulations are also intended to harmonise penalties for breaking the regulations in different countries.

Enforcement involves managing quotas and implementing technical measures to preserve fish stocks. Inspectors may check fishing gear and inspect the register of fish caught. The type of fish caught is checked and compared to quotas of total permitted catch for a vessel. Checks may be made in port or at sea, and using aerial photography.

Inspectors may also check fish processing factories to ensure that all fish is documented and can be traced to its source. EU inspectors check that hygiene and processing regulations in any country exporting to the EU are satisfactory and of an equal standard to controls within the EU.

Non-compliance remains a significant problem. In a number of EU fisheries, illegal fishing accounts for one-third to one-half of all catches.

==Funding provision==
Fishing was initially funded under the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF). In 1993 a separate fund was established (FIFG), the Financial Instrument for Fisheries. From 1994 to 1999 the budget for FIFG totalled 700&amp;nbsp;million ECU. Any grant from FIFG must be accompanied by a minimum contribution from the national government. A grant to business must include a proportionate contribution from the business itself. Different rates of aid are applied to different regions.

From 2007 to 2013, the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds|European Fisheries Fund]] (EFF) will provide approximately 4.3&amp;nbsp;billion Euro to the European fishing sector. The adoption of the EFF was not uncontested, in particular by environmental groups, as it includes the possibility to fund vessel modernisation and other measures, which might increase pressure on already [[overfished]] stocks.

==Fishing and the environment==
In 1997 [[North Sea]] states and EU representatives agreed a joint approach to identifying risks to the marine environment. A precautionary approach was adopted to seek to prevent pollution before damage was caused to the environment. Studies are being undertaken to monitor stocks of all fish, not just commercially important species.

==Criticism==
The Common Fisheries Policy has been argued by certain commentators to have had disastrous consequences for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1570439/Fishing-quotas-are-an-ecological-catastrophe.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Christopher | last=Booker | title=Fishing quotas are an ecological catastrophe | date=25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/brunowaterfield/9604035/The_human_cost_of_the_EUs_fishing_failure/ | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=The human cost of the EU's fishing failure | date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is contradicted by historical evidence revealing that fishing stocks have been in chronic decline over the last century as a result of intensive [[Bottom trawling|trawl fishing]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | first=Richard | last=Black | title='Profound' decline in fish stocks shown in British records | date=4 May 2010 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10096649.stm |work=BBC News  | pages = | accessdate = 5 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scientific research published in 2010, the depletion of fishing stocks is a consequence of mismanagement long before the Common Fisheries Policy came into being, a statement illustrated by the fact that British catches have declined by 94% over the last 118 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thurstan | first1 = Ruth H. | last2 = Brockington | first2 = Simon | last3 = Roberts | first3 = Callum M. | title = The effects of 118 years of industrial fishing on UK bottom trawl fisheries | journal = [[Nature Communications]] | volume = 1 | pages = 15 | publisher = [[Nature Publishing Group]] | doi = 10.1038/ncomms1013 | date = 4 May 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1013 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Common Fisheries Policy has continued the trend of ineffective fisheries management in European waters. Indeed, the Common Fisheries Policy has done little if anything to reverse the decline of European fish stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Khalilian | first1 = Setareh | last2 = Froese | first2 = Rainer | last3 = Proelss | first3 = Alexander | last4 = Requate | first4 = Till | title = Designed for failure: a critique of the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union | journal = [[Marine Policy]] | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1178–1182 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.marpol.2010.04.001 | date = November 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2010.04.001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common fisheries policy has been criticised by some fishermen who believe it is threatening their livelihoods.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

EU quotas can mean that fish are thrown overboard after being caught; yet as they are dead, this does not alleviate the problem as it was intended to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/6122954/EU-fisheries-minister-calls-for-an-end-to-dumping-millions-of-dead-fish.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=EU fisheries minister calls for an end to dumping millions of dead fish | first=Louise | last=Gray | date=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Common Fisheries Policy has been a major reason for countries with both substantial fish resources and small home markets, like Norway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/03/29/norway-and-the-eu/ | work=Euronews | title=Why isn’t Norway in the EU? | date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nordic States and European Unity|last = Ingebritsen|first = Christine|publisher = Cornell University Press|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Iceland and European Integration: On the Edge|last = Thorhallsson|first = Baldur|publisher = Routledge|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-56703-1_4|title=Nordic Nationalism and Right-Wing Populist Politics|last=Bergmann|first=Eirikur|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781137567024|pages=93–124|language=en|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-56703-1_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Danish dependencies ([[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/21516|title=Fish keep Faroe Islands at a distance from EU|author=|date=|website=euobserver.com|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and some other dependencies, to stay outside the European Union.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} 

=== Management ===

==== Subsidiarity ====

A common criticism of the CFP is its [[Centralisation|centralised]], top-down approach to management; although [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] are responsible for the policy's implementation and enforcement, members have given the European Commission sole competence in the creation of proposals and the making of decisions. The Commission is not exclusively responsible for the setting of [[Total Allowable Catch|total allowable catches]]. These are proposed by the commission but ultimately determined by the Council of [Fisheries] Ministers.  Allocation of national catch quotas to Member States is on a pre-determined basis—the so-called relative stability—giving each member state pre-determined percentages of the available fishing opportunities. Although Member States hold some responsibilities, such as the distribution of quotas, it is argued that the EU retains too much authority over fisheries management. Furthermore, critics maintain that the organisation is ill-suited to the task of fisheries management as it lacks sufficient understanding of fisheries, and is too far removed from the realities of the industry to set accurate TACs and quotas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sissenwine|first=M.|author2=Symes, D.|title=Reflections on the Common Fisheries Policy|journal=EU commissioned report|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[command-and-control]] method characterised by the CFP is no longer deemed an effective form of fisheries management, and advocates of CFP reform consider a shift from traditional government to participatory third-order [[governance]], incorporating the fisheries industry and Member States, to be vital to the success of the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sellke|first=P.|author2=Dreyer, M.|title=Enhancing Regionalisation of the Common Fisheries Policy: An Opportunity and Challenge for Participatory Fisheries Governance in the EU|journal=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association Annual Conference "Global Governance: Political Authority in Transition"|year=2011|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p500182_index.html|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, it is suggested that the management of the CFP could be improved through the application of the theory of [[subsidiarity]]—the principle that political decisions should be handled at the lowest, least-centralised competent level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=Andrew|last2=Jeppersen |first2 = Tim|title=EU Environmental policy: adapting to the principle of subsidiarity?|journal=Environmental Policy and Governance |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=64–74 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0976(200003/04)10:2&lt;64::AID-EET219&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z | date = March–April 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-0976%28200003/04%2910:2%3C64::AID-EET219%3E3.0.CO;2-Z | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidiarity principle was introduced into EU policies as part of the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]]; however, it does not apply to areas such as the CFP over which the [[European Economic Community|Community]] retains exclusive competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coffey|first=C.|title=Good Governance and the Common Fisheries Policy: An Environmental Perspective|journal=Institute for European Environmental Policy Report|year=2000|url=http://www.ieep.eu/assets/235/goodgovernanceandthecommonfisheriespolicy.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partial [[devolution]] of authority, for example involving Member States in the decision-making process and delegating the day-to-day management of fisheries to industry-based organisations, could potentially facilitate the inclusion of industry concerns into the CFP, involving those directly affected by the policy in management decisions and creating to a CFP which encourages compliance and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Symes | first1 = David | last2 = Phillipson | first2 = Jeremy | title = Whatever became of social objectives in fisheries policy? | journal = [[Marine Policy]] | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.fishres.2008.08.001 | date = March 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2008.08.001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The call for application of the subsidiarity principle to the CFP lies within the argument for its [[decentralisation]]. De-centralisation featured prominently in discussions related to the 2002 CFP reform, but the reform itself actually increased centralisation within the CFP, removing the right of Member States to block quota proposals and increasing the EU's role in enforcement. This increasing monopoly and disregard for the wishes of the fisheries industry led to alienation of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and resulted in reduced compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = Tim | last2 = Hatchard | first2 = Jenny | title = The 2002 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy's system of governance—rhetoric or reality? | journal = [[Marine Policy]] | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 545–554 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/S0308-597X(03)00066-6 | date = November 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-597X(03)00066-6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of this increasingly centralised reform has proved to de-centralisation advocates that stakeholder participation in the governance process is crucial to the future success of fisheries governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Participation in Fisheries Governance|publisher=Springer|location=Netherlands|author=Hatchard, J.|authorlink=Engaging stakeholder preferences through deliberative democracy in North Sea fisheries governance|editor=T. Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some critics argue that applying the subsidiarity principle to the CFP may not improve the policy's effectiveness, as it may lead to what de Vivero ''et al.'' term the "participation paradox"—the theory that the greater the number of actors involved in the decision-making process, the less significant the contribution made by each actor, and the smaller the participatory role played in the policy process. Greater devolution within CFP decision-making may therefore silence the voice of the fisheries industry as it competes with other state, private and civil actors to whom authority is also granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suárez de Vivero | first1 = Juan L. | last2 = Rodríguez Mateos | first2 = Juan C. | last3 = del Corral | first3 = D. Florido | title = The paradox of public participation in fisheries governance. The rising number of actors and the devolution process | journal = [[Marine Policy]] | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 319–325 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.marpol.2007.06.005 | date = May 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2007.06.005 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although the subsidiarity principle can facilitate the government-to-governance transition advocated by many in relation to reform of the CFP, the participatory role of key stakeholders affected by the policy must be maximised to ensure the development of an effective and equitable Common Fisheries Policy.

==History==

===1970===
{{POV section|date=July 2016}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
The first rules were created in 1970. The original six Common Market members realised that four countries applying to join the Common Market at that time (Britain, Ireland, Denmark including Greenland, and Norway) would control the richest fishing grounds in the world. The original six therefore drew up Council Regulation 2141/70 giving all Members equal access to all fishing waters, even though the Treaty of Rome did not explicitly include fisheries in its agriculture chapter. This was adopted on the morning of 30 June 1970, a few hours before the applications to join were officially received. This ensured that the regulations became part of the acquis communautaire before the new members joined, obliging them to accept the regulation. In its accession negotiations, the UK at first refused to accept the rules but by the end of 1971 the UK gave way and signed the Accession Treaty on 22 January 1972, thereby bringing into the CFP joint management an estimated four fifths of all the fish off Western Europe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Norway decided not to join. Greenland left the EC in 1985, after having gained partial independence from Denmark in 1979.

When the fisheries policy was originally set up the intention was to create a free trade area in fish and fish products with common rules. It was agreed that fishermen from any state should have access to all waters, except Irish fishermen that were refused access to fish any waters east of 4 deg west, thus closing the north sea to them. An exception was made for the coastal strip, which was reserved for local fishermen who had traditionally fished those areas. A policy was created to assist modernisation of fishing vessels and on-shore installations.

===1976===
In 1976 the EC extended its fishing waters from 12 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles ({{cvt|12|nmi|km|1|disp=out}} to {{cvt|200|nmi|km|1|disp=out}}) from the coast, in line with other international changes. This required additional controls and the CFP as such was created in 1983. This now had four areas of activity: conservation of stocks, vessels and installations, market controls, and external agreements with other nations.

===1992===
It was determined that there had been over-investment in vessels, over-fishing and that numbers of fish landed were decreasing.  The review identified a need to improve compliance with the regulations. This led to a tightening of regulations and better monitoring of individual vessels. A second review was planned for 2002.

===1995===
Although fishing could be managed by reducing the fleet size, available fish vary from year to year too much to make this sensible. So a permit system was introduced stating where and when boats are allowed to fish. Scientific studies were commissioned to better-determine available stocks and guide allocation of permits.

===2009===
In 2009, the EU Commission launched a wide-ranging debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  Common Fisheries Policy Reform | url = http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/reform/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the way that EU fisheries are managed. It received input from EU citizens, organisations and EU-countries and published a report on the consultation.

===2013===
In February 2013 the European Parliament voted for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, including measures to protect endangered stocks, and the ending of discards. The new CFP came into effect from 1 January 2014, though more talks with EU governments are involved. In presenting the reform package, the German Social Democrat MEP Ulrike Rodust stated: "As of 2015 the principle of  [[maximum sustainable yield]] shall apply ... Our objective is that depleted fish stocks recover by 2020. Not only nature will benefit, but also fishermen: bigger stocks produce higher yields."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21352617 BBC News: Euro MPs back large-scale fishing reform to save stocks]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 reform led to a greater role for the European Parliament, involving the convening of a trilateral dialogue (or "trilogue") between the European Council, European Commission and the Parliament, to work towards general agreement on reforming the CFP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Fisheries/Topics/EU-common-fisheries-policy/Executive-Brief-Update-2013-EU-Common-Fisheries-Policy-and-Fisheries-Partnership-Agreements-Challenges-for-ACP-countries EU Common Fisheries Policy and Fisheries Partnership Agreements – Challenges for ACP countries.

'''Downtown Austin''' is the central business district of [[Austin, Texas]]. Downtown is located on the north bank of the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]]. The approximate borders of Downtown include Lamar Boulevard to the west, Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and the [[University of Texas at Austin]] to the north, [[Interstate 35 (Texas)|Interstate 35]] to the east, and [[Lady Bird Lake]] to the south.&lt;ref&gt;"[ftp://ftp.ci.austin.tx.us/DowntownAustinPlan/dap_approved_12-8-2011.pdf Downtown Austin Plan]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6fAtpLi2q?url=ftp://ftp.ci.austin.tx.us/DowntownAustinPlan/dap_approved_12-8-2011.pdf Archive]).

It is where the city's highrise buildings are located, as well as being the center of government and business for the region. Downtown Austin is currently experiencing a building boom, with many condos and high rise towers being built.

==History==
The story of Downtown Austin began with the [[Republic of Texas]] and President [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] in the 1830s. Lamar tapped [[Edwin Waller]] to direct the planning and construction of the new town. Waller chose a site on a bluff above the Colorado River, nestled between [[Shoal Creek (Texas)|Shoal Creek]] to the west and [[Waller Creek]] to the east. Waller laid the new city in a simple grid pattern on a 640-acre (or one square-mile plot) with 14 blocks running in both directions. Much of this original design is still intact in downtown Austin today.

One grand avenue, which Lamar named [[Congress Avenue|"Congress,"]] cut through the center of town from Capitol Square down to the Colorado River. The streets running north-south (paralleling Congress) were named for Texas rivers with their order of placement matching the order of rivers on the Texas state map. The east-west streets were named after trees native to the region, despite the fact that Waller had recommended using numbers (they were eventually changed to numbers in 1884). The city's perimeters stretched north to south from the river at 1st Street to 15th Street, and from East Avenue (now [[Interstate 35]]) to West Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Spurlin |last=Charles D. |journal= Handbook of Texas |title= Waller, Edwin |url= http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fwa38 |accessdate= September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waller reserved key spots for public buildings and four public squares. Three of Waller's original squares survive to this day: [[Wooldridge Park]], [[Republic Square (Austin, Texas)|Republic Square]] and [[Brush Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Barnes |first=Michael |title= Thank Edwin Waller for Austin’s rational plan |date= September 7, 2011 |url= http://www.austin360.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/outandabout/entries/2011/09/07/thank_edwin_wal.html |accessdate= November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress Avenue===
[[Edwin Waller]], the first mayor of Austin, designed Congress Avenue to be Austin's most prominent street. Planned as the widest street in the original 1839 Austin plan, the 120-foot wide Congress Avenue initially ran from the Colorado River north to the [[Texas State Capitol|State Capitol]]. Not coincidentally, Congress was the most important street in Austin city life during the 19th century. Early structures along Congress Avenue included government buildings, hotels, saloons, retail stores and restaurants. By the late 1840s "The Avenue" formed a well-established business district. The mid-1870s introduced [[gas lighting|gaslight]] illumination and mule-driven [[tram|streetcars]] as well as construction of a new [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] courthouse at Eleventh Street.

Stretching from First Street north to Eleventh Street, the [[Congress Avenue Historic District (Austin, Texas)|Congress Avenue Historic District]] was created on August 11, 1978. Stylistically, the dominating structures of significance reflected general [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] form and detailing, tempered by local materials and building techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= McGraw, Marburger &amp; Associates |title= History of South Congress |url= https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:1174DgI_9KQJ:www.historicbouldincreek.org/PDF/sconhistory.pdf+south+congress+avenue+austin+history&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgTILosO5Y66vzO4Howc3mqJ_V5ijRjRearWHGC01OpwE5g4KECnVyjzjdOoKLW_2XG-okEPE9bzPdWk92LSKY6mKJDoGWBzhfUAUGd2i2X-qRQHyceH8rmDJDt8oK-awHR7aM9&amp;sig=AHIEtbTrYcZQMmSVBjVZjBaoZkdFlguvOA |accessdate= October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable structures along Congress Avenue north of the Colorado include the Texas State Capitol, [[The Paramount Theatre (Austin, Texas)|Paramount Theatre]], the Southwestern Telegraph and Telephone Building, [[Gethsemane Lutheran Church]] and the [[Lundberg Bakery (Austin, Texas)|Old Bakery]].

===Sixth Street===
{{main|Sixth Street (Austin, Texas)}}
[[Sixth Street (Austin, Texas)|Sixth Street]] is a historic street and entertainment district in Downtown Austin. Sixth Street itself stretches from [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|Mopac Expressway]] in [[Old West Austin Historic District|Old West Austin]] to [[Interstate 35]] and beyond. The western portion includes the historic [[West Sixth Street Bridge]] at Shoal Creek. The nine-block area of East Sixth Street roughly between Lavaca Street to the west and [[Interstate 35]] to the east is recognized as the ''Sixth Street Historic District'' and was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on December 30, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=6th Bar Blues |last=Whitacre |first=Whitacre |publisher=[[The Daily Texan]] |date=August 15, 2001 |url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/2.8460/6th-bar-blues-1.1268585 |accessdate=July 14, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

E. Sixth Street plays host to a wide variety of events each year, ranging from [[music festival|music]] and film festivals (such as [[South by Southwest]]) to [[motorcycle|biker]] rallies (such as [[Republic of Texas Biker Rally|The Republic of Texas Biker Rally]]) and the [[Pecan Street Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=6th Street Revealed |publisher=Celebrate Austin Magazine |url=http://www.celebrate-austin.com/c.php?p=93 |accessdate=July 14, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of Sixth Street west of Lavaca is known as the ''West 6th Street District''. Recently, there has been a growing movement to develop this area as an entertainment district of its own, geared toward the live music crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Gerbe |first= Bret |title= A night on the other side reveals a burgeoning entertainment district among the office buildings and condos |publisher= Austin American-Statesman |date= November 8, 2006 |url= http://www.austin360.com/news/content/events/stories/xl/2006/11/9cover.html |accessdate= November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 15, 2014, in response to a deadly crash during the SXSW festival and the increase of intoxicated patrons, vehicular parking between Brazos and Red River Streets is prohibited between the hours of 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=APD to ban parking on part of 6th Street during peak hours |url=http://www.newsradioklbj.com/News/story.aspx?ID=2169092 |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Late-night parking on Sixth Street to end |url=http://kxan.com/2014/05/09/new-parking-restrictions-on-6th-street/ |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Public safety officials to discuss SXSW crash Monday |url=http://kxan.com/2014/04/06/public-safety-officials-to-discuss-sxsw-crash-monday/ |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rainey Street===
The [[Rainey Street Historic District (Austin, Texas)|Rainey Street Historic District]] is a community positioned near Lady Bird Lake and [[Interstate 35]] in a southeastern pocket of downtown. The situation at Rainey Street is unique in that the area was once a sleepy residential street, albeit nestled right next to downtown, was rezoned as part of Austin's central business district in 2004. The hope at the time was to incentivize development near the [[Austin Convention Center]] and the since-built Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center. But while grander development has stalled, bars and eateries have flocked to Rainey, since CBD zoning enables traffic-heavy cocktail bar or restaurant use without any additional zoning request. As such, old bungalows have been fixed up and turned into bars and cocktail lounges with ample backyards and porches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Dunbar, Jr. |first= Wells |title= The Lure of Rainey Street |publisher= Austin Chronicle |date= January 28, 2011 |url= http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2011-01-28/city-hall-hustle-the-lure-of-rainey-street/ |accessdate= November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West End/Market District===
The West End or Market District of Austin is located in the northwest section of Downtown Austin, just north of the Seaholm District and to the west of the Warehouse District.

===Seaholm District===
The Seaholm District is a formerly industrial section of southwest downtown Austin that the city wants to transform into a vibrant urban neighborhood. The city of Austin has designated the area from [[Lady Bird Lake]] to 5th Street and from Lamar Boulevard to San Antonio Street as the Seaholm District. At the core of the district is the decommissioned [[Seaholm Power Plant]], which will be redeveloped into a landmark residential and retail destination. After several years of delays and false starts due in part to a recession that dried up financing for development, construction is expected to start on redevelopment projects at the former Seaholm Power Plant and the site of the former Green Water Treatment Plant east of Seaholm in 2012. Austin-based Southwest Strategies Group, the project's lead developer, announced plans to begin work on the 450,000 square feet of development to be built on the 7.8 acre site. The projects will transform the decommissioned plants on downtown's southwestern edge into lively hubs with shops, hotels, condominiums, apartments and other development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Novak |first= Shonda |title= After years of delays, construction in sight for areas in Seaholm District, official says |publisher= Austin American-Statesman |date= October 17, 2011 |url= http://www.statesman.com/business/after-years-of-delays-construction-in-sight-for-1921958.html |accessdate= November 24, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111121091739/http://www.statesman.com/business/after-years-of-delays-construction-in-sight-for-1921958.html |archivedate= November 21, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bremond Block Historic District===
The [[Bremond Block Historic District (Austin, Texas)|Bremond Block Historic District]] is a collection of eleven historic homes located in the west corner of downtown, constructed from the 1850s to 1910.&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;{{cite web |last= Williamson |first= Roxanne |title= Bremond Block Historic District |publisher= Handbook of Texas Online |url= http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ghb02 |accessdate= November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The block was added to [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1970, and is considered one of the few remaining upper-class [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] neighborhoods of the middle to late 19th century in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = TEXAS – Travis County Historic Districts |publisher= [[National Register of Historic Places]] |url= http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/tx/Travis/districts.html |accessdate= September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six of these houses were built or expanded for members of the families of brothers Eugene and John Bremond, who were prominent in late-19th-century Austin social, merchandising, and banking circles. They are located within the square block bordered by West Seventh, West Eighth, Guadalupe, and San Antonio streets. The district also includes several houses on the west side of San Antonio and the south side of West Seventh, at least three of which were built or altered by the North family.&lt;ref name="Williamson"/&gt;

===Judges Hill===
Judges Hill is a largely residential neighborhood is located north of the central business district of downtown Austin on the eastern bluff overlooking [[Pease Park]], bordered by Rio Grande Street, 15th Street, Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd and Lamar Blvd. In 1851, [[Elijah Sterling Clack Robertson]] built the first home in present-day Judges Hill near the corner of 18th and San Gabriel. Although the house was subsequently demolished in 1966. Judge Robertson was the first among the neighborhood resident judges and attorneys who earned the area the name of Judges Hill. The area includes many historically designated properties from the late 19th century, some significant mid-century modern design, student communities and limited multi-family housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Judges Hill History |publisher= Judges Hill Neighborhood Association |url= http://judgeshill.org/history/history.html |accessdate= November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red River Cultural District===

{{Forms of government}}
{{Politics}}
'''E-government''' (short for [[electronics|electronic]] [[government]]) is the use of electronic communications devices, [[computer]]s and the [[Internet]] to provide public services to citizens and other persons in a country or region. According to Jeong, 2007 the term consists of the digital interactions between a citizen and their government (C2G), between governments and other government agencies (G2G), between government and citizens (G2C), between government and employees (G2E), and between government and businesses/commerces (G2B). E-government delivery models can be broken down into the following categories:&lt;ref name="JeongChunHai"&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). ''Fundamental of Development Administration.'' Selangor: Scholar Press. {{ISBN|978-967-5-04508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interaction consists of citizens communicating with all levels of government (city, state/province, national, and international), facilitating citizen involvement in [[governance]] using [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) (such as computers and [[website]]s) and [[business process re-engineering]] (BPR). Brabham and Guth (2017) interviewed the third party designers of e-government tools in North America about the ideals of user interaction that they build into their technologies, which include progressive values, ubiquitous participation, geolocation, and education of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brabham|first=Daren C.|last2=Guth|first2=Kristen L.|date=2017-08-01|title=The Deliberative Politics of the Consultative Layer: Participation Hopes and Communication as Design Values of Civic Tech Founders|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12316/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=445–475|doi=10.1111/jcom.12316|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other definitions are more away from technology as an object, to see them simply as facilitators or instruments and focus on specific changes in Public Administration issues, and in the internal transformation of a Government, is the case of the definition that established the specialist technologist Mauro D. Ríos in the paper "In search of a definition of Electronic Government", he says: "Digital Government is a new way of organization and management of public affairs, introducing positive transformational processes in management and the structure itself of the organization chart, adding value to the procedures and services provided, all through the introduction and continued appropriation of information and communication technologies as a facilitator of these transformations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://novagob.org/en-busca-de-una-definicia3n-de-gobierno-electra3nico/|title=En busca de una definición de Gobierno Electrónico – NovaGob|website=novagob.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
E-government is also known as e-gov, electronic government, Internet governance, digital government, online government, connected government. As of 2014 the [[OECD]] still uses the term digital government, and distinguishes it from e-government in the recommendation produced there for the Network on E-Government of the Public Governance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;

 |author1=Public Governance |author2=Territorial Development Directorate | publisher=OECD
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several governments have started to use the term digital government to a wide range of services involving contemporary technology, such as big data, automation or predictive analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apolitical.co/flagship/big-data-and-digital-government/|title=Tech and data: can 'digital government' be radically smarter?|website=Apolitical|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
''E-gov strategies'' (or ''digital government'') is defined as "The employment of the Internet and the world-wide-web for delivering government information and services to the citizens." (United Nations, 2006; AOEMA, 2005).&lt;ref name="UNEGovSurvey2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''Electronic government'' (or ''e-government'') essentially refers to "utilization of [[Information Technology]] (IT), Information and Communication Technologies (ICT s), and other web-based telecommunication technologies to improve and/or enhance on the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in the public sector.".&lt;ref name="JeongChunHai" /&gt; E-government promotes and improves broad stakeholders contribution to national and community development, as well as deepen the governance process.&lt;ref name="Egov"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alenezi |first1=Hussain |last2=Tarhini |first2=Ali |last3=Sharma |first3=Sujeet Kumar |title=Development of quantitative model to investigate the strategic relationship between information quality and e-government benefits |journal=Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy |date=2015 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=324–351 |doi=10.1108/TG-01-2015-0004 |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/TG-01-2015-0004 |accessdate=5 January 2016 |ref=(Alenzi et al., 2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In electronic government systems, government operations are supported by web-based services. It involves the use of information technology, specifically the Internet, to facilitate the communication between the government and its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csi-sigegov.orgwww.csi-sigegov.org/1/1_369.pdf|title=E-Government and E-Governance: Definitions/Domain|last=Jain Palvia|first=Shailendra|date=|website=csi-sigegov.org|publisher=Computer Society of India|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN e-Government Development Index==

The Division of a Public Administration and Development Management (DPAPM) of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA) conducts a bi-annual e-government survey which includes a section titled ''e-Government Development Index (EGDI)''. It is a comparative ranking of 193 countries of the world according to three primary indicators: i) the OSI - Online Service Index that measures the online presence of the government in terms of service delivery; ii) the TII - Telecommunication Infrastructure Index iii) HCI -Human Capital Index . Constructing a model for the measurement of digitized services, the Survey assesses the 193 member states of the UN according to a quantitative composite index of e-government readiness based on website assessment; telecommunication infrastructure and human resource endowment.&lt;ref name="UNEGovSurvey2016" /&gt;

A diverse group of 100 researchers [[Online volunteering|online volunteers]] from across the globe engaged with the United Nations Department of Economic Affairs (UN DESA) to process 386 research surveys carried out across 193 [[UN Member States]] for the 2016 UN E-Government Survey.&lt;ref name="egovsurvey16"&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 UN E-Government Survey|url=https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of nationalities and languages of the online volunteers&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/stories/2013_undesa.html Online Volunteering service, Experiences]&lt;/ref&gt;—more than 65 languages, 15 nationalities, of which half are from developing countries—mirrors perfectly the mission of the survey.

==Comparison with e-governance==
{{main|e-governance}}
E-government should enable anyone visiting a city website to communicate and interact with city employees via the Internet with graphical user interfaces (GUI), instant-messaging (IM), learn about government issues through audio/video presentations, and in any way more sophisticated than a simple email letter to the address provided at the site”&lt;ref&gt;Kaylor, C., Deshazo, R. and Van Eck, D.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of [[e-governance]] is "The enhanced value for stakeholders through transformation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0740-624X(01)00089-2 | volume=18 | title=Gauging e-government: A report on implementing services among American cities | year=2001 | journal=Government Information Quarterly | pages=293–307 | last1 = Kaylor | first1 = Charles | last2 = Deshazo | first2 = Randy | last3 = Van Eck | first3 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “the use of technology to enhance the access to and delivery of government services to benefit citizens, business partners and employees”.&lt;ref&gt;Deloitte Research – Public Sector Institute [http://www.egov.vic.gov.au/pdfs/e-government.pdf At the Dawn of e-Government: The Citizen as Customer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122814/http://www.egov.vic.gov.au/pdfs/e-government.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The focus should be on:
* The use of [[information and communication technologies]], and particularly the Internet, as a tool to achieve better government.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/60/60/2502539.pdf The e-government imperative: main findings], Policy Brief, Public Affairs Division, Public Affairs and Communications Directorate, OECD, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of information and communication technologies in all facets of the operations of a government organization.&lt;ref&gt;Grima-Izquierdo, C. (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/A-generic-architecture-eGovernment-eDemocracy/dp/3848437627 A generic architecture for e-Government and e-Democracy: requirements, design and security risk analysis]. Ed. LAP Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Koh, C.E. |author2=Prybutok, V.R. |title=The three-ring model and development of an instrument for measuring dimensions of e-government functions|journal= Journal of Computer Information Systems|volume= 33|issue=3|pages=34–9|year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The continuous optimization of service delivery, constituency participation, and governance by transforming internal and external relationships through technology, the Internet and new media.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner Group, “Key Issues in E-Government Strategy and Management,” Research Notes, Key Issues, 23 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
Whilst e-government has traditionally been understood as being centered around the operations of government, e-governance is understood to extend the scope by including citizen engagement and participation in governance. As such, following in line with the OECD definition of e-government, e-governance can be defined as the use of ICTs as a tool to achieve better governance.

==Delivery models and activities of e-government==
The primary delivery models of e-government can be divided into:
* [[G2C|Government-to-citizen]] or government-to-consumer (G2C) approaches such as setting up [[website]]s where citizens can download forms, government information, etc.
** In this model, the G2C model applies the strategy of [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) with business concept.
** By managing their "customer" (citizen) relationship, the business (government) can provide the needed products and services fulfill the needs of the customer (citizen).
** In United States, the NPR ([[National Partnership for Reinventing Government]]) has been implemented from 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, B., &amp; Milakovich, M. (January 1, 2005). Citizen Relationship Management and E-Government. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3591, 57–68&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Government-to-business]] (G2B)
* [[Government-to-government]] (G2G)
* [[Government-to-employees]] (G2E)

Within each of these interaction domains, four kinds of activities take place:&lt;ref&gt;Mary Maureen Brown. "Electronic Government" Jack Rabin (ed.). ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy'', Marcel Dekker, 2003, pp. 427–432 {{ISBN|0824742400}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-10|url=http://www.iceg.net/2007/books/1/1_369.pdf|publisher=ICEG|title=E-Government and E-Governance: Definitions/Domain Framework and Status around the World|format=PDF|author1=Shailendra C. Jain Palvia |author2=Sushil S. Sharma |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* pushing information over the Internet, e.g.: regulatory services, general holidays, public hearing schedules, issue briefs, notifications, etc.
* two-way communications between the agency and the citizen, a business, or another government agency. In this model, users can engage in dialogue with agencies and post problems, comments, or requests to the agency.
* conducting transactions, e.g.: lodging tax returns, applying for services and grants.
* governance, e.g.: To enable the citizen transition from passive information access to active citizen participation by:
# Informing the citizen
# Representing the citizen
# Encouraging the citizen to vote
# Consulting the citizen
# Involving the citizen

==Non-internet e-government==
While e-government is often thought of as "online government" or "Internet-based government," many non-Internet "electronic government" technologies can be used in this context. Some non-Internet forms include [[telephone]], [[fax]], [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]], [[Short message service|SMS]] text messaging, [[Multimedia Messaging System|MMS]], wireless networks and services, [[Bluetooth]], [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]], tracking systems, [[RFID]], [[biometric]] identification, road traffic management and regulatory enforcement, [[identity cards]], [[smart cards]] and other [[near field communication]] applications; polling station technology (where non-online [[e-voting]] is being considered), TV and radio-based delivery of government services (e.g., [[Control System Middleware for operator functioning (CSMW)|CSMW]]), email, [[online community]] facilities, [[newsgroup]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s, [[online chat]], and [[instant messenger|instant messaging]] technologies.

== Controversies ==

===Disadvantages===
The main disadvantages concerning e-government is the lack of equality in public access to computers and the internet (the "[[digital divide]]", a reference to the fact that people who have low incomes, who are [[homeless]] and/or who live in remote regions may have little or no access to the Internet), reliability of information on the web, and issues that could influence and bias public opinions. There are many considerations and potential implications of implementing and designing e-government, including [[disintermediation]] of the government and its citizens, impacts on economic, social, and political factors, vulnerability to [[cyber attack]]s, and disturbances to the ''status quo'' in these areas.&lt;ref name="information137"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Atkinson | first1 = Robert D. | last2 = Castro | first2 = Daniel | title = Digital Quality of Life | publisher = The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation | pages = 137–145 | year = 2008 | url=http://www.itif.org/files/DQOL-14.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Electronic leviathan]].

The political nature of public sector forms are also cited as disadvantages to e-government systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/topics/resource-guides/governance/key-issues/e-government/challenges-for-e-government#.WE-RiJMrJAY|title=Challenges for e-government|last=Collodi|first=Jason|date=|website=eldis.org/|publisher=Institute of Development Studies|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trust ===
Trust in e-governance is very highly dependent on its performance and execution, which can be measured through the effectiveness of current actions. This is much riskier and prone to fluctuation than a system of trust that is based on reputation because performance does not consider past actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=E-Governance and Civic Engagement: Factors and Determinants of E-Democracy|last=Manoharan|first=Aroon|publisher=IGI Global|year=2011|isbn=161350084X|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
Because E-government is in the early stages of development in many countries and jurisdictions, it is hard to be applied to forms of government that have been institutionalized. Age-old bureaucratic practices being delivered in new mediums or using new technologies can lead to problems of miscommunication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csi-sigegov.orgwww.csi-sigegov.org/1/1_369.pdf |title =E-Government and E-Governance: Definitions/Domain Framework and Status around the World | author= Palvia, Shailendra and Sharma, Sushil|accessdate=2017-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hyper-surveillance====
Increased electronic contact and data exchange between government and its citizens goes both ways. Once e-government technologies become more sophisticated, citizens will be likely be encouraged to interact electronically with the government for more transactions, as e-services are much less costly than [[bricks and mortar]] service offices (physical buildings) staffed by [[civil servant]]s. This could potentially lead to a decrease in privacy for civilians as the government obtains more and more information about their activities. Without safeguards, government agencies might share information on citizens. In a worst-case scenario, with so much information being passed electronically between government and civilians, a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]-like system could develop. When the government has easy access to countless information on its citizens, personal [[privacy]] is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/48629.html?wlc=1235202183 |title=AT&amp;T Sued for Role in Aiding US Government Surveillance |publisher=TechNewsWorld |author=Lyman, Jay |date=2006-02-01 |accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/08/analysis-new-la.html |title=Analysis: New Law Gives Government Six Months to Turn Internet and Phone Systems into Permanent Spying Architecture |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |author=Singel, Ryan |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cost====
Although "a prodigious amount of money has been spent"&lt;ref&gt;The good, the bad and the inevitable | The Economist http://www.economist.com/node/10638105&lt;/ref&gt; on the development and implementation of e-government, some say{{Who|date=February 2014}} it has yielded only a mediocre result. The outcomes and effects of trial Internet-based government services are often difficult to gauge or users seem them unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?STORY_ID=10638105 |title=The pros and cons of e-government |publisher=Economist |date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Gartner, Worldwide IT spending is estimated to total $3.6 trillion in 2011 which is 5.1% increase from the year 2010 ($3.4 trillion).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1513614 |title=Global IT Spending |publisher= Gartner |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inaccessibility====
{{Main|Digital divide}}
An e-government website that provides government services often does not offer the "potential to reach many users including those who live in remote areas [without Internet access], are homebound, have low literacy levels, exist on poverty line incomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igi-pub.com/files/prefaces/jeco%20preface%201(3).pdf |title=Bridging Literacy, Language, and Cultural Divides to Promote Universal Usability of E-Government Websites |publisher=[[Northern Arizona University]] |author=Becker, Shirley A. |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[homelessness|Homeless]] people, people in poverty and elderly people may not have access.

====False sense of transparency and accountability====
Opponents of e-government argue that online governmental transparency is dubious because it is maintained by the governments themselves. Information can be added or removed from the public eye. To this day, very few organizations monitor and provide accountability for these modifications. Those that do so, like the United States’ OMBWatch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ombwatch.org/ |title=ombwatch.org |publisher=ombwatch.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104170904/http://www.ombwatch.org/ |archivedate=2013-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Government Accountability Project]], are often nonprofit volunteers. Even the governments themselves do not always keep track of the information they insert and delete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcworld.about.com/news/Sep112002id104796.htm |title=Has Terrorism Curtailed E-Government? |publisher=Medill News Service |author=Chiger, Stephen |date=2002-09-11 |accessdate=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904235925/http://pcworld.about.com/news/Sep112002id104796.htm |archivedate=2008-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===

The ultimate goal of the e-government is to be able to offer an increased portfolio of public services to citizens in an efficient and cost effective manner. E-government allows for government transparency. Government transparency is important because it allows the public to be informed about what the government is working on as well as the policies they are trying to implement.
Simple tasks may be easier to perform through electronic government access. Many changes, such as marital status or address changes can be a long process and take a lot of paper work for citizens. E-government allows these tasks to be performed efficiently with more convenience to individuals.
E-government is an easy way for the public to be more involved in political campaigns. It could increase voter awareness, which could lead to an increase in citizen participation in elections.
It is convenient and cost-effective for businesses, and the public benefits by getting easy access to the most current information available without having to spend time, energy and money to get it.

E-government helps simplify processes and makes government information more easily accessible for public sector agencies and citizens. For example, the [[Indiana]] Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records to be admitted in county court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in.gov/bmv/ Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles]. In.gov (2009-06-16). Retrieved on 2012-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indiana]] became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically by using Electronic Postmark technology. In addition to its simplicity, [[e-democracy]] services can reduce costs. [[Alabama]] Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources, [[Wal-Mart]] and NIC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicusa.com |title=nicusa.com |publisher=nicusa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an online hunting and fishing license service utilizing an existing computer to automate the licensing process. More than 140,000 licenses were purchased at [[Wal-Mart]] stores during the first hunting season and the agency estimates it will save $200,000 annually from service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_GovTech-Aug05.pdf |title=Picking Up the Tab |publisher=Government Technology |date=September 2005 |accessdate=2009-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821131811/http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_GovTech-Aug05.pdf |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anticipated benefits of e-government include efficiency, improved services, better accessibility of public services, sustainable community development and more transparency and accountability.&lt;ref name="information137"/&gt;

====Democratization====
{{Main|E-democracy}}
One goal of some e-government initiatives is greater citizen participation. Through the Internet's [[Web 2.0]] interactive features, people from all over the country can provide input to politicians or public servants and make their voices heard. [[Blog]]ging and interactive surveys allow politicians or public servants to see the views of the people on any issue. [[Chat room]]s can place citizens in real-time contact with elected officials or their office staff or provide them with the means to interact directly with public servants, allowing voters to have a direct impact and influence in their government. These technologies can create a more transparent government, allowing voters to immediately see how and why their representatives in the capital are voting the way they are. This helps voters decide whom to vote for in the future or how to help the public servants become more productive.

A government could theoretically move more towards a true [[democracy]] with the proper application of e-government. [[Open government|Government transparency]] will give insight to the public on how decisions are made and hold elected officials or public servants accountable for their actions. The public could become a direct and prominent influence in government legislature to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/ericjsinrod/2004-06-30-sinrod_x.htm |title=A look at the pros and cons of e-government |publisher=[[USA Today]] |author=Sinrod, Eric J. |date=2004-06-30 |accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/417520 |title=How Web 2.0 Will Transform Local Government |publisher=Digital Communities |author=Schrier, Bill |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2008-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023020229/http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/417520 |archivedate=2008-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdt.org/egov/handbook/transparency.shtml |title=Transparency |publisher=Center for Democracy &amp; Technology |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315105326/http://cdt.org/egov/handbook/transparency.shtml |archivedate=2009-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zenergyglobal.com/lib/facilitating-effective-online-participation-in-e-government-Thorpe.pdf |title=Facilitating effective online participation in e-government |publisher=E-government in [[New Zealand]] |author=Thorpe, Stephen J. |date=2008-06-23 |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520221620/http://www.zenergyglobal.com/lib/facilitating-effective-online-participation-in-e-government-Thorpe.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental bonuses====
{{Main|Paperless office}}
Proponents of e-government argue that online government services would lessen the need for hard copy paper forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yourpenntrafford.com/penntraffordstar/article/so-how-much-paper-does-our-local-government-use |title=So, how much paper does our local government use? |publisher=Penn-Trafford Star |author=Dezayas, Heidi |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2008-03-01 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to recent pressures from [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] groups, the media, and the public, some governments and organizations have turned to the Internet to reduce paper use. The United States government utilizes the website http://www.forms.gov to provide “internal government forms for federal employees” and thus “produce significant savings in paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/egov_docs/FY09_Benefits_Report.pdf |title=Report to Congress on the Benefits of the President's E-Government Initiatives ("Business Gateway," p. 50) |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226145709/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/egov_docs/FY09_Benefits_Report.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, if citizens can apply for government services or permits online, they may not need to drive into a government office, which could lead to less [[air pollution]] from gas and diesel-fuelled vehicles.

====Speed, efficiency, and convenience====
E-government allows citizens to interact with computers to achieve objectives at any time and any location and eliminates the necessity for physical travel to government agents sitting behind desks and windows. Many e-government services are available to citizens with computers and Internet access 24 hours a day and seven days a week, in contrast to [[bricks and mortar]] government offices, which tend to be only open during [[business hour]]s (notable exceptions are [[police station]]s and [[hospital]]s, which are usually open 24 hours a day so that staff can deal with emergencies).

Improved accounting and record keeping can be noted through computerization, and information and forms can be easily accessed by citizens with computers and Internet access, which may enable quicker processing time for applications and find information. On the administrative side, access to help find or retrieve files and linked information can now be stored in electronic databases versus hard copies (paper copies) stored in various locations. Individuals with disabilities or conditions that affect their mobility no longer have to be mobile to be active in government and can access public services in the comfort of their own homes&lt;ref&gt;Satyanarayana, J. ''E-Government: The Science of the Possible.'' India: Prentice Hall, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Nixon | first1 = Paul G. | last2 = Rawal | first2 = Rajash | title = Enabling Democracy? e-Government, Inclusion and Citizenship | publisher = The Hague University | pages = 281–290 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=eC60D0q7m0AC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=cons+of+e-government | isbn = 978-1-905305-11-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as long as they have a computer and Internet and any accessibility equipment they may need).

====Public approval====
{{Main|e-participation}}
Recent trials of e-government have been met with acceptance and eagerness from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070426005159/en/Study-Finds-Federal-Gains-Electronic-Government-Citizen |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180613111852/https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070426005159/en/Study-Finds-Federal-Gains-Electronic-Government-Citizen |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2018-06-13 |title= Study Finds Federal Gains in Electronic Government and Citizen Services; Challenges Remain |publisher= Bearing Point |date= 2007-04-26 |accessdate= 2009-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Urdiales | first1 = C. | last2 = de Trazegnies | first2 = C. | last3 = Salceda | first3 = J.

Although Internet-based governmental programs have been criticized for lack of reliable privacy policies, studies have shown that people value prosecution of offenders over personal confidentiality. Ninety percent of United States adults approve of Internet tracking systems of criminals, and 57% are willing to forgo some of their personal [[internet privacy]] if it leads to the prosecution of criminals or terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcworld.about.com/news/Mar122002id88684.htm |title=How Much Government Snooping Is Okay? |publisher=Medill News Service |author=Roy, Saumya |date=2002-03-12 |accessdate=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023161650/http://pcworld.about.com/news/Mar122002id88684.htm |archivedate=2008-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology-specific e-government==
There are also some technology-specific sub-categories of e-government, such as [[m-government]] (mobile government), ubiquitous government), and g-government ([[GIS]]/[[GPS]] applications for e-government).

The previous concern about developments in E-government concerning technology are due to the limited use of online platforms for political reasons by citizens in local political participations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mossberger|first=Karen|year=2009|title=CAN E-GOVERNMENT PROMOTE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT?|url=https://ipce.uic.edu/interior/egovtfinalreport2009.pdf|journal=Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary delivery models of e-government are classified depending on who benefits. In the development of public sector or private sector portals and platforms, a system is created that benefits all constituents. Citizens needing to renew their vehicle registration have a convenient way to accomplish it while already engaged in meeting the regulatory inspection requirement. On behalf of a government partner, the business provides what has traditionally, and solely, managed by government and can use this service to generate profit or attract new customers. Government agencies are relieved of the cost and complexity of having to process the transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Government Technology’s Public CIO Thought Leadership Profile [http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_PublicCIO-Aug06.pdf "Expanding eGovernment, Every Day"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326054720/http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_PublicCIO-Aug06.pdf |date=2010-03-26 }} open-access online paper 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

To develop these public sector portals or platforms, governments have the choice to internally develop and manage, outsource, or sign a self-funding contract. The self-funding model creates portals that pay for themselves through convenience fees for certain e-government transactions, known as self-funding portals.

[[Social networking service]]s and websites are an emerging area for e-democracy. The social networking entry point is within the citizens’ environment and the engagement is on the citizens’ terms. Proponents of e-government perceive government use of social networking as a medium to help government act more like the public it serves. Examples can be found at almost every state government portal through [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]] widgets.

Government and its agents also have the opportunity to follow citizens to monitor satisfaction with services they receive. Through ListServs, RSS feeds, mobile messaging, micro-blogging services and blogs, government and its agencies can share information to citizens who share common interests and concerns. Government is also beginning to [[Twitter]]. In the state of [[Rhode Island]], Treasurer [[Frank T. Caprio]] is offering daily tweets of the state’s cash flow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/RITreasury/ RI Treasury (@RITreasury) op Twitter]. Twitter.com.

==Government 2.0==

Government 2.0 or Gov 2.0 refers to government policies that aim to harness collaborative technologies and interactive [[Internet]] tools to create an [[open source|open-source]] [[computing platform]] in which government, citizens, and innovative companies can improve transparency and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Reilly|first=Tim|title=Gov 2.0: It's All About The Platform|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/04/gov-20-its-all-about-the-platform/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply, Gov 2.0 is about "putting government in the hands of citizens".&lt;ref name=harper&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Logan|title=Gov 2.0 Rises to the Next Level: Open Data in Action|url=http://opensource.com/government/13/3/future-gov-20|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=Open Source|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gov 2.0 combines interactive [[Web 2.0]] fundamentals with e-government and increases citizen participation by using open-source platforms, which allow development of innovative [[Application software|apps]], websites, and [[Software widget|widgets]].

===Africa===

====Kenya====
Following the transition from the longstanding [[Kenya African National Union]] government to the [[National Rainbow Coalition – Kenya|National Rainbow Coalition]] government in December 2002, in January 2004 a Directorate of e-government was established after an executive (cabinet) session. The newly created department had the duty to draw the plan of action for future ICT implementations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-government.go.ke "Welcome to e-government"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606020549/http://www.e-government.go.ke/ |date=2013-06-06 }}, Kenya e-Government website, Directorate of e-Government Kenya, Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other African nations, Kenya has embraced the high mobile penetration rate within its population. Even people living in remote areas that did not have access to traditional telecommunications' networks can now communicate with ease. The fact of the same has, and continues to have, a great impact on the governments' strategies in reaching out to its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mgovservice.ru/upload/uploadfiles/From%20eGov%20to%20mGov.pdf "From E-government to M-government: Facing the Inevitable"], Ibrahim Kushchu and M. Halid Kuscu, Mobile Government Lab (mGovLab), May 2004, Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Given that about 70% of the population owns mobile phones, leading mobile network operators like Safaricom have taken a great step in offering services that meet citizens' demands. Such services include Kipokezi (which allows subscribers to do online chatting and also exchange electronic mails via standard mobile phones), and [[M-Pesa]] (which allows the subscribers to send and receive electronic cash). Such services have even appealed to the majority of Kenyans, as they support the branchless members of the society too, in undertaking normal and secure businesses via M-Pesa.  The recent [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] report reveals that MPESA transactions in Kenya exceeded those carried out by the Western Union worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2011/afr/eng/sreo1011.pdf "Regional Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa, Sustaining the Expansion"], World Economic and Financial Surveys, International Monetary Fund,  October 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-61635-125-0}}, Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====
E-government in Indonesia is developing, especially in central and regional/local government offices. E-government was officially introduced to public administration by Presidential Directive No 6/2001 on Telematics, which states that the government of Indonesia has to use telematics technology to support good governance. Furthermore, e-government should have been introduced for different purposes in government offices. As one of ISO member countries, Indonesia gives more attention to facilitate the activities of standardization. Among of the facilities provided are building the National information system of standardization (SISTANAS) and Indonesia Standardization Information Network (INSTANET).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/07/27/challenges-e-government-implementation.html|title=Challenges in e-government implementation|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, ministries, institutions and local governments of Indonesia used to run separate e-government systems, which is now integrated into a central based system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://govinsider.asia/innovation/indonesia-integrated-e-government-system/|title=Indonesia to launch integrated e-government system|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the government has also undertaken programs for digitization of SMEs and the informal sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/asean-business/can-indonesia-be-a-powerhouse-in-the-digital-economy|title=Can Indonesia be a powerhouse in the digital economy?|newspaper=The Business Times|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the cities across Indonesia including [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Surabaya]],and [[Makassar]] are implementing the concept of [[Smart City]], consisting of e-government, e-health, e-education, e-logistics and e-procurement as priority areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2018/07/13/smart-cities-digital-savviness-to-resilient-living.html|title=Smart cities: Digital savviness to resilient living|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
In 2002, Iran published a detailed report named TAKFA (Barnameye Tose-e va Karborde Fanavaie Etela’at) in which it was predicted that most of the government bodies would try to virtualize their services as soon as possible. However, based on the reports by UN bodies, Iran has failed in the recent years to meet the average standards of e-government. In 2008, the Supreme Council of Information released a report which criticized the government for its poor advancement in employing new communication technologies for administration purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shahghasemi | first1 = E. | last2 = Tafazzoli | first2 = B. | last3 = Akhavan | first3 = M. | last4 = Mirani | first4 = G. | last5 = Khairkhah | first5 = T. | year = 2013 | title = Electronic Government in Iran: A Case Study | url = | journal = Online Journal of Social Sciences Research | volume = 2 | issue = 9| pages = 254–262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malaysia====
In Malaysia, the e-government efforts are undertaken by the Malaysian government, under the umbrella of Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) and e-government flagships, which was launched in mid-1996, by Dr Mahathir Mohamad (1981-2003), by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia (Jeong &amp; Nor Fadzlina, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mscmalaysia.my/ |title=mscmalaysia.my |publisher=mscmalaysia.my |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi.

====Pakistan====
{{Main|E-Government in Pakistan}}

In 2014, the [[Government of Pakistan]] created the National Information Technology Board (NITB) under the Ministry of Information Technology &amp; Telecom to enable a digital eco-system for Government services to the citizens of [[Pakistan]]. NITB was formed as a result of a merger between Pakistan Computer Bureau (PCB) and Electronic Government Directorate (EGD). 
&lt;br /&gt;
The key functions identified by the NITB are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040331032631/http://www.e-government.gov.pk/ e-Government Pakistan]. E-government.gov.pk. Retrieved on 2012-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Provide technical guidance for the introduction of e-Governance in the Federal Govt. 
* Suggest efficient and cost-effective implementation of e-government programs in the Federal Ministries/Divisions. 
* To carry out training need assessment and design and implement the identified IT capacity building programs for the employees of Federal Ministries/Divisions.
* Review the status of e-government readiness on a regular basis to ensure sustainable, accelerated digitization and relevant human resource development.
* Identify the areas where IT interventions can be helpful and to suggest measures for the automation of these areas through Business Process Re-engineering (BPR).
NITB rolled out an e-Office Suite across various ministries in the [[Government of Pakistan]]. While it clearly pursued efficiency gains and improved transparency, it also hoped to deliver "efficient and cost-effective public services to citizens of Pakistan." The suite primarily included five modules or applications across all the ministries. Description of each module listed are: 
* Internal Communication Module
* HR Management Module
* Inventory &amp; Procurement Management Module
* Project Management Module
* Finance Budget Module
NITB released a high-level diagram that describes the process of transforming Federal Government agencies and ministries to e-Office environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.e-government.gov.pk/frmdetailse190.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003173827/http://www.e-government.gov.pk/frmdetailse190.html |archive-date=2016-10-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism: NITB's roll out of the e-Office suite across almost all federal agencies is not only overly ambitious but also likely to fail. It seems to put together a lot of lofty organizational efficiency goals with a set of delivery or citizen-facing targets. In fact, most of the services NITB has provided have been largely conceptual and not sufficient concrete. The process outlines in the adoption process diagram seems devoid of any user-centric design or value proposition formulation. Instead of creating lots of MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and taking advantage of an iterative and validated learning the process, the e-Office Suite seems to incorporate all the features and functions that various ministries and divisions may need or use. It seems to focus more on the needs of the bureaucrats and government agencies rather than the needs of the end user (citizens of Pakistan) and what services would they need that a ministry or division can provide.

====Sri Lanka====
Sri Lanka have taken some initiative actions to provide the benefits of e-government to the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.lk |title=Government of Sri Lanka Official Web Portal |publisher=Gov.lk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gic.gov.lk/ |title=Government Information Center |publisher=Gic.gov.lk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thailand====

The next stage was the five-year project of digital government, which began in 2016 and will be completed in 2021. This project assumes that within five years, more than 80% of Thai government agencies will use electronic documents for identification&lt;ref&gt; https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2017/12/31/egovernance-making-progress-in-thailand/ &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/956189/e-governance-making-progress-in-thailand &lt;/ref&gt;.

There is the Unified State Portal of e-Government of Thailand&lt;ref&gt;www.egov.go.th&lt;/ref&gt;, developed by the Ministry of Information and Telecommunications Technology in 2008.

In 2018, Thailand ranks 73rd in the UN e-government ranking. &lt;ref&gt; https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/Portals/egovkb/Documents/un/2018-Survey/E-Government%20Survey%202018_FINAL%20for%20web.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

The portal of public services is one of the key elements of the project to create "electronic government" in the country. The portal provides a single point of access to all references on state and municipal services through the Internet and provides citizens and organizations the opportunity to receive these services electronically. Monthly visits by users of the public services portal range between 200,000 and 700,000. For example, citizens are now able to get or exchange a driver license through this portal.

4. Head system providing utilization of electronic signature.

Other systems located on cloud services.

Today Russian e-government elements are demanded in the spheres of e-governance, e-services (e-health, e-education, e-library, etc.), e-commerce, e-democracy (web-election, Russian public initiative).
By the United Nations E-Government Survey 2012: E-Government for the People Russia became one of the 7 emerging leaders in e-government development, took 9th place in rating of e-government development in largest population countries, took 8th rank in Top e-participation leaders, after Norway, Sweden and Chile, Advancing 32 positions in the world rankings, the Russian Federation became the leader of e-government in Eastern Europe.

====Ukraine====
The main coordinating government body in matters of e-government is [[:uk:Державне агентство з питань електронного урядування | State e-Government Agency]], which was established on June 4, 2014. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.e.gov.ua/ua&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the state policy of the development of the information society was the adoption in 1998-2006 of the Laws of Ukraine "On electronic documents and electronic document circulation", "On the national program of informatization", "On the electronic digital signature" and a number of state acts related to informatization. Later, the Law of Ukraine “On the Basic Principles of the Information Society in Ukraine for 2007-2015”, “On Information Protection in Information and Telecommunication Systems” and a number of other legislative acts aimed at concretization and specification of these laws were adopted. This law emphasized the use of information and telecommunication technologies to improve public administration, relations between the state and citizens. The next stage of e-government development began in 2015 after the adoption of the Agreement of parliamentary factions of the [[Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine]] (in 2014) and the adoption of the Development Strategy "Ukraine - 2020", which was approved by Decree of the President of Ukraine dated January 12, 2015 (No. 5/2015).

In 2018, Ukraine ranks 82nd in the UN e-government ranking. &lt;ref&gt;https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/Portals/egovkb/Documents/un/2018-Survey/E-Government%20Survey%202018_FINAL%20for%20web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{Main|Open data in Canada}}

The current [[Clerk of the Privy Council (Canada)|Clerk of the Privy Council]] – the head of the federal public service has made workplace renewal a pillar of overall public service renewal. The key to workplace renewal is the adoption of collaborative networked tools. An example of such a tool is [[GCPEDIA]] – a wiki platform for federal public servants. Other tools include GCconnex, a social networking tool, and GCforums, a discussion board system.

On January 21, 2009, the President signed one of his first memorandums – the Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on Transparency and Open Government.&lt;ref name="Transparency and Open Government"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Transparency_and_Open_Government/ Transparency and Open Government]. Whitehouse.gov. Retrieved on 2012-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The memo called for an unprecedented level of openness in Government, asking agencies to "ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration."&lt;ref name="Transparency and Open Government"/&gt; The memo further "directs the [[Chief Technology Officer]], in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Administrator of General Services (GSA), to coordinate the development by appropriate executive departments and agencies [and] to take specific actions implementing the principles set forth in the memorandum."&lt;ref name="Transparency and Open Government"/&gt;

President Obama’s memorandum centered around the idea of increasing [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] throughout various different federal departments and agencies. By enabling public websites like recovery.gov and data.gov to distribute more information to the American population, the administration believes that it will gain greater citizen participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-04-27/news/27644253_1_online-town-hall-barack-obama-obama-administration | title = Obama's e-government off to good start | accessdate = 2010-05-07 | date = 2009-04-27 | work = Economictimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the U.S. federal government launched [[Data.gov]] in order to make more government data available to the public. With data from Data.Gov, the public can build [[Applications software|apps]], websites, and [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]]. Although "Gov 2.0", as a concept and as a term, had been in existence since the mid-2000s, it was the launch of Data.gov that made it "go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]]".&lt;ref name=harper /&gt;

In August 2009 the [[City of San Francisco]] launched [https://data.sfgov.org DataSF.org] with more than a hundred datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newsom|first=Gavin|title=San Francisco Opens The City’s Data|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/19/san-francisco-opens-the-city’s-data/|newspaper=TechCrunch|date=19 August 2009|authorlink=Gavin Newsom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just weeks after the DataSF.org launch, new apps and websites were developed. Using data feeds available on DataSF.org, civic-minded developers built programs to display public transportation arrival and departure times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Routesy Bay Area|url=http://www.routesy.com/|publisher=Routesy|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where to recycle hazardous materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newsom|first=Gavin|title=Recycling in San Francisco Made Easy with the iPhone |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2009/06/15/recycling-in-san-francisco-made-easy-with-the-iphone/|newspaper=Clean Technica|date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and crime patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco Crimespotting|url=http://sanfrancisco.crimespotting.org/|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the launch of DataSF.org there have been more than seventy apps created with San Francisco's data.

In March 2009, former [[San Francisco Mayor]] [[Gavin Newsom]] was at [[Twitter]] headquarters for a conversation about technology in government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSE20sVyyeo "A Conversation with Twitter about the Future of Technology in Government"] (video), Gavin Newsom and Evan Williams, Mayor's Press Conference (YouTube), 10 March 2009, 47 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt; During the town hall, Newsom received a tweet about a [[pothole]].&lt;ref name=mitch&gt;{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=Mitch|title=San Francisco Twitters With Citizens To Fix City|url=http://www.informationweek.com/internet/social-network/san-francisco-twitters-with-citizens-to/217702151|newspaper=InformationWeek|date=8 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned to Twitter co-founders [[Biz Stone]] and [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]] and said let's find a way for people to tweet their service requests directly to San Francisco's 311 customer service center. Three months later, San Francisco launched the first Twitter 311 service, called @SF311, allowing residents to tweet, text, and send photos of potholes and other requests directly to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Grove|first=Jennifer|title=San Francisco First City to Instate City-Wide 311 Twitter Program|url=http://mashable.com/2009/06/02/san-francisco-311-twitter/|newspaper=Mashable|date=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with Twitter and using the open-source platform, CoTweet turned @SF311 into reality.

'''El Cortez''', a [[hotel]] and [[casino]], is a relatively small downtown [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] gaming venue a block from the [[Fremont Street Experience]] and [[Las Vegas Boulevard]].  Slots, table games, and a race and sports book occupy one floor of the main pavilion. It is one of the older casino-hotel properties in Las Vegas having continuously operated at the same Fremont Street location since 1941. Primarily [[Spanish Colonial Revival]] in style, it reflects a 1952 remodel when the façade was modernized.&lt;ref name=LVS022613&gt;Ron Sylvester, [http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/feb/25/el-cortez-joins-national-register-historic-places/ El Cortez joins National Register of Historic Places], ''Las Vegas Sun'', February 25, 2013, accessed February 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, 2013, the structure was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Clark County, Nevada|National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=NRHPlisting&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20130222.htm Weekly List for February 22, 2013], National Park Service, February 22, 2013, accessed February 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Marion Hicks and J.C. Grayson built El Cortez, downtown Las Vegas' first major resort, in 1941 for $245,000.&lt;ref name="Chung 2005. p.56"&gt;Chung, Su Kim. ''Las Vegas Then and Now''. Thunder Bay Press. San Diego, California: 2005. p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The location at 6th Street and Fremont was originally considered too far from downtown, but it quickly became so profitable that [[Bugsy Siegel]], [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Gus Greenbaum]] and [[Moe Sedway]] bought the property in 1945 from J. Kel Houssels for $600,000.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Su Kim. ''Las Vegas Then and Now''. Thunder Bay Press. San Diego, California: 2005. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bugsy-siegel-opens-flamingo-hotel |title=Bugsy Siegel opens Flamingo Hotel |author= |date= |work= |publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Kell (J. Kell) Houssels, Sr. (1895–1979) had originally opened the 59-room hotel and casino before the sale to the major [[organized crime]] figures. Houssels purchased the hotel back from Siegel's group in 1946 for $766,000. In 1963, the ''Pavilion Rooms'' were added after the hotel was purchased by [[Jackie Gaughan]]. Another 15-story tower addition was completed in 1980. The 64-room Cabana Suites were completed in the former Ogden House in 2009, bringing the total room count to its current 364.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.unlv.edu/arch/casinosbyname.html#e Las Vegas Hotels / Casinos: Time Line] UNLV Libraries&lt;/ref&gt; Gaughan, a casino owner and operator since the early 1950s, lived in El Cortez's tower penthouse and was known to be on the casino floor almost daily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcortezhotelcasino.com/el_cortez_history.html EL Cortez History ]&lt;/ref&gt; The property is one of the few casinos to have never changed its exterior façade in Las Vegas, retaining the same signage and ranch-themed architecture for over seventy years.&lt;ref name="Chung 2005. p.56"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinenevada.org/el_cortez_hotel_casino |title=El Cortez Hotel-Casino |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Online Nevada Encyclopedia |accessdate=November 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208101036/http://onlinenevada.org/el_cortez_hotel_casino |archivedate=December 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=El Cortez mixes retro with modern in marking 70th year |author=Caitlin McGarry |url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/el-cortez-mixes-retro-with-modern-in-marking-70th-year-133288943.html |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review Journal]] |date= November 5, 2011|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackie Gaughan's son [[Michael Gaughan (businessman)|Michael Gaughan]] ran the sports and race book in the current casino under the name ''South Point Race and Sports Book'' during the late 2000s, but the sports book is now run by [[Station Casinos]]. El Cortez has undergone several renovations,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} with the latest major remodeling completed in 2006. New carpet, marble flooring, gaming machines, refurbished guest rooms and an upgraded kitchen for the restaurant were added.&lt;ref&gt;at [https://web.archive.org/web/20060507232401/http://www.lvbusinesspress.com/articles/2006/02/28/news/news01.txt City refurbishing rundown area to become hub of nightlife in valley].

February 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although only a block away from the [[Fremont Street Experience]], the hotel is part of the newly-created [[Fremont East]] section of downtown. It has also created a main entrance off [[Las Vegas Boulevard]] (5th Street) by opening a block-long pedestrian walkway from the boulevard to the hotel's main entrance on 6th Street. El Cortez is also well known in the casino industry as the most prominent "break-in house" for new table-game dealers to get experience before moving onto bigger properties. The separate hotel in the back, the 100-room Ogden House, has been completely renovated into the 64-suite ''Cabana Suites''.

In 2008, Jackie Gaughan sold El Cortez and its properties to Kenny Epstein.&lt;ref&gt;Long Gaughan [http://www.lvrj.com/business/18758759.html] El Cortez owner sells stake in downtown casino, Las Vegas Review-Journal dated May 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Gaughan continued to live at the casino and still played poker in the poker room until his death on March 12, 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1747">'''Euroméditerranée''' is an [[urban renewal project]] underway in [[Marseille]] to create an [[ecodistrict]] in the [[La Joliette]] neighbourhood.

The project was launched in 1995 with the initiative of [[Robert Vigouroux]], former Mayor of Marseille, and the State. The agreement for the establishment of a public agency of development was signed in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euromediterranee.fr/quartiers/presentation.html&lt;/ref&gt; working on an area of 310 hectares.
Since 2007, "Euroméditerranée Act 2" extended the scope to 170 more hectares.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euromediterraneeacte2.fr/de-euromediterrannee-1-a-euromediterrannee-2/euromediterranee-2/&lt;/ref&gt; This project is funded by the European Union, the State, the Regional Council, the Departemental Council, the urban community and the City of Marseille.

The Euroméditerranée eco-district is home to the Thassalia project, Europe’s first geothermal marine power station, which uses the waters of the Mediterranean to cool buildings in the summer and warm them in the winter.

Among the achievements of Euroméditerranée figure: [[Docks (Marseille)|the Docks]] renovation into offices, the renovation of the silo into a theater, the renovation of the Rue de la République, the construction of the [[CMA CGM Tower|CMA-CGM tower]] (33 floors, 147m tall). The budget of the project amounts to €7 billion investment, of which €5 billion of private investment.

'''Fulton Center''' is a transit center and retail complex centered at the intersection of [[Fulton Street (Manhattan)|Fulton Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. The name also refers to the $1.4 billion project by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), a public agency of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], to rehabilitate the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[Fulton Street (New York City Subway)|Fulton Street]] station. The work involved constructing new underground passageways and access points into the complex, renovating the constituent stations, and erecting a large station building that doubles as a part of the [[Westfield World Trade Center]] mall.

The project, first announced in 2002, was intended to improve access to and connections among the New York City Subway services stopping at the Fulton Street station. Funding for the construction project, which began in 2005, dried up for several years, with no final approved plan and no schedule for completion. Plans for the transit center were revived by the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. The project used to be referred to as the '''Fulton Street Transit Center''', but was re-branded the Fulton Center in May 2012 because of a heightened emphasis on retail. The complex officially opened on November 10, 2014, along with the adjacent [[Dey Street Passageway]].

Through the Dey Street Passageway, the complex connects to the [[World Trade Center (2001–present)|World Trade Center]], the Westfield World Trade Center mall, [[World Trade Center station (PATH)|PATH station]], and observation deck, and provides connections to the [[Chambers Street–World Trade Center/Park Place/Cortlandt Street (New York City Subway)|Chambers Street–World Trade Center/Park Place/Cortlandt Street]] ({{NYCS Chambers Cortlandt}}) and [[WTC Cortlandt (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|WTC Cortlandt]] ({{NYCS Broadway-Seventh South Ferry}}) stations, as well as the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]]'s World Trade Center station. [[Westfield Corporation]] operates the retail space as an extension of the [[Westfield World Trade Center]], a block to the west.

The major elements of the Fulton Center project included the renovations of the [[Fulton Street (New York City Subway)|Fulton Street]] stations along the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]] and the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]]. During the latter's renovation, new entrances were opened at the corner of Broadway and Maiden Lane for the northbound platform, and at Cortlandt Street and Broadway for the southbound platform.&lt;ref name=capconstr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/capconstr/fstc/construction.html |title=Construction Update &amp;#124; Construction Schedule |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408213831/http://web.mta.info/capconstr/fstc/construction.html |archivedate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mezzanine serving the [[Fulton Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Fulton Street]] station on the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]], which previously consisted of several ramps on either side of Nassau Street, was straightened.&lt;ref name=EIS1/&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name=capconstr/&gt; During these renovations, the entire complex was made [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]]. Ten escalators and fifteen elevators were installed, as well as two ADA accessible public restrooms on the concourse and the street levels.&lt;ref name="mta 20141110"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mta.info/news-fulton-center/2014/11/10/welcome-new-fulton-center |title=MTA – news – Welcome to the New Fulton Center |publisher=Mta.info |accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new station building, the Fulton Building, was constructed along the east side of Broadway between Fulton and John Streets. The new station required the demolition of the Girard Building and the former [[Childs Restaurant]] Building, and incorporates the landmark [[Corbin Building]] at the corner of Broadway and John Street. It was nearly canceled at one point, but was saved in 2009 through funds from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].&lt;ref name=NYT-Planning-Stimulus-2009/&gt; This portion of the project was part of a master lease to lease over 60,000 square feet of space.&lt;ref name=capconstr/&gt;  The Fulton Center opened on November 10, 2014, seven years behind schedule and $650 million over budget.&lt;ref name="fultonstopens"/&gt; Owing to the Fulton Center's use of [[renewable energy]] sources and energy-conservation features, the complex was awarded a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Silver certification in March 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Press Release – NYC Transit – MTA's Fulton Center Awarded LEED Silver Rating |website=MTA |date=March 16, 2016 |url=http://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/mtas-fulton-center-awarded-leed%C2%AE-silver-rating | access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first subway station in New York City to receive such a rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fulton Center is first subway station to receive special rating for environmental friendliness |website=Metro US |date=March 17, 2016 |url=https://www.metro.us/new-york/fulton-center-is-first-subway-station-to-receive-leed-rating/zsJpcp---ktJeDbkfabXTQ | access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to work on the four linked Fulton Street stations, the Dey Street Passageway, located outside the subway system's [[fare control|paid area]],&lt;ref name=EIS3 /&gt; was built under Dey Street. It connected the Fulton Street station complex to the [[Cortlandt Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Cortlandt–Church Streets]] station, serving the {{NYCS trains|Broadway south}}.&lt;ref name="fultonstopens" /&gt;&lt;ref name=EIS1/&gt;{{rp|5}}.&lt;ref name=capconstr/&gt; A new entrance building was constructed on the southwest corner of Broadway and Dey Street, providing direct access to the Dey Street passageway.&lt;ref name=capconstr/&gt;&lt;ref name=MTA-DeyStHeadhouse-Oct2012/&gt; It opened alongside the rest of the Fulton Center in November 2014, and an extension to the World Trade Center Transportation Hub opened in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Altamirano | first=Angy | title=MTA opens passage connecting Fulton Center to WTC PATH station | website=Metro | date=May 26, 2016 | url=http://www.metro.us/new-york/mta-to-open-passage-connecting-fulton-center-to-wtc-path-station/zsJpez---qzMgrE9w38Q4/ | accessdate=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were plans for a free transfer between the Cortlandt–Church Street station and the {{NYCS trains|Eighth far south local}} at the [[World Trade Center (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|World Trade Center]] station; however, this plan was removed due to [[value engineering|cost overruns]].&lt;ref name="fultonstopens" /&gt; {{As of|2017|June|alt=As of June 2017}}, the connection was again slated to be built and the passageway opened with newly-rearranged turnstiles.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/capitaldashboard/allframenew_head.html?PROJNUM=t6041409&amp;PLTYPE=1 |title=T6041409 Reserve: Church Street Corridor Improvements Passenger Stations |last= |first= |date= |website=web.mta.info |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection opened on December 29, 2017, after a reconfiguration of the respective stations' fare areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://tribecacitizen.com/2017/12/30/getting-to-the-oculus-just-got-much-easier/ |title=Getting to the Oculus Just Got Much Easier |last= |first= |date=December 30, 2017 |website=Tribeca Citizen|access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate transfer to the {{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh South Ferry}} at [[WTC Cortlandt (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|WTC Cortlandt]], outside the fare controls of either the Cortlandt–Church/World Trade Center or Fulton Street stations, was opened on September 8, 2018.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-CortlandtReopens-2018&gt;{{cite web | title=Cortlandt Street Station, Damaged on Sept. 11, Reopens 17 Years Later | website=The New York Times | date=September 8, 2018 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/nyregion/cortlandt-street-subway-station-911.html | access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Need and funding ===
After several pieces of transit infrastructure in Lower Manhattan were destroyed or severely damaged during the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], officials proposed a $7 billion redesign of transit in the neighborhood. This included the Fulton Street Transit Center, the [[South Ferry/Whitehall Street (New York City Subway)|South Ferry/Whitehall Street]] terminal further downtown, and the reconstruction of the [[West Side Highway]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSY3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=SL19-PA5 |title=Permanent WTC PATH Terminal: Environmental Impact Statement |last=[[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] |first= |date=2007 |publisher=[[United States Department of Transportation]]; [[Federal Transit Administration]] |year= |isbn= |location= |pages= |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|S.5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/20/nyregion/7.3-billion-vision-to-rebuild-transit-near-ground-zero.html |title=$7.3 Billion Vision To Rebuild Transit Near Ground Zero |last=Wyatt |first=Edward |date=April 20, 2002 |work=The New York Times|access-date=February 3, 2018 |last2=Kennedy |first2=Randy |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important of these projects was the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]'s proposed [[World Trade Center station (PATH)|terminal]] for [[PATH (rail system)|PATH trains]] at the World Trade Center site, which was destroyed when the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|World Trade Center collapsed]]. A preliminary plan for the new terminal included situating it under [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]], near the site of the former [[Hudson Terminal]] and close to the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA)'s [[Fulton Street (New York City Subway)|Broadway–Nassau/Fulton Street]] station. The new terminal would also contain direct connections to the subway; previously, World Trade Center had been served by three different subway stations at [[Cortlandt Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Cortlandt–Greenwich Streets]], [[Cortlandt Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Cortlandt–Church Streets]], and [[Chambers Street–World Trade Center/Park Place (New York City Subway)|Church Street between Chambers and Vesey Streets]].

As part of the rebuilding process, the Port Authority considered putting the PATH terminal at Broadway and Fulton Street.

=== Planning and cutbacks ===
Compared with other subway stations' renovations, the Fulton Street Transit Center's funding was secure because the project was financed using money from the [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center|September 11 recovery]] fund.&lt;ref name=NYTimes=SubwayRetailing-2005&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/realestate/the-underground-economy-subway-retailing.html |title=The Underground Economy: Subway Retailing |last=Chamberlain |first=Lisa |date=May 22, 2005 |work=The New York Times|access-date=February 24, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; After funding for the transit center had been secured, the project's [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impact statement]] was released in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyE3AQAAMAAJ |title=Fulton Street Transit Center, New York, New York, Section 4(f) Evaluation: Environmental Impact Statement |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] |year=2004 |accessdate=December 18, 2016 |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was still undergoing revisions as of mid-2005, and was to be completed by October 2005.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Construction was set to begin later that year.&lt;ref name=NYTimes=SubwayRetailing-2005/&gt;

Funding problems began in June 2005, when the original plans were cut back. The projected cost of the Fulton Street Transit Center had grown by $75 million, to $825 million. The design had been delayed to May 2006, and the proposed completion date was now December 2008.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In March 2006, the land under the [[Corbin Building]] was taken for the proposed transit center by [[eminent domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/29/realestate/pressing-a-claim-for-dutch-history.html |title=Pressing a Claim for Dutch History |last=Chamberlain |first=Lisa |date=March 29, 2006 |work=The New York Times|access-date=February 25, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; A block to the north, the MTA began the process of evicting and relocating 148 store owners near the site of the transit center's main building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/02/nyregion/02fulton.html |title=Shops Near Planned Transit Hub Face Eviction |last=Lueck |first=Thomas J. |date=June 2, 2006 |work=The New York Times|access-date=February 25, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_127/shopsmoving.html |title=Shops moving to make room for train project |last=Kaysen |first=Ronda |date=October 20, 2005 |website=DOWNTOWN EXPRESS &amp;#124; The Newspaper of Lower Manhattan|access-date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The budget of real-estate acquisition also rose from $50 million to $157 million.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This cost increase was a key factor in the ballooning costs of the transit center over the next several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archpaper.com/2008/02/folly-at-fulton-st/ |date=February 20, 2008 |first=Matt |last=Chaban |title=Folly at Fulton St.; MTA back to drawing board for downtown transit hub |publisher=Archpaper.com |accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fulton-street-transit-center-2010-03-24-2.JPG|thumb|Construction site of the Fulton Center Main Building, seen in March 2010]]

Meanwhile, the costs of other [[MTA Capital Construction]] projects were rising as well. The issue peaked in January 2008, when the MTA announced that three other capital projects (the [[7 Subway Extension]], the [[Second Avenue Subway]], and [[East Side Access]]) were facing a combined cost overrun of $1 billion.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To remedy the overrun, plans for the Fulton Center's main building had to be downsized: instead of being a {{Convert|114|ft|m|-high|adj=mid}} structure with a large dome, the headhouse would now be a simple stainless-steel building with a smaller dome.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/arts/design/10cent.html |title=Proposal Would Relocate Ground Zero Arts Center to Transit Hub |last=Pogrebin |first=Robin |date=April 10, 2008 |work=The New York Times|access-date=February 26, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project, excluding the main building, was now expected to cost $903 million. The main building would cost another $250 million, if built. The cost overruns were attributed to the fact that the MTA had received a single, $870 million bid for one phase of construction, more than twice the $408 million the MTA had originally set aside for that phase. The date of completion was now set for 2010, and the MTA had ordered a 30-day review of the Fulton Center plan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fulton transit-hub plan collapses, MTA's $900M boondoggle |last=Gallahue |first=Patrick |publisher=[[New York Post]] |page=3 |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/01292008/news/regionalnews/mtas_900m_boondoggle_681543.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130125327/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01292008/news/regionalnews/mtas_900m_boondoggle_681543.htm |archivedate=January 30, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nysun.com/new-york/mta-fulton-center-cost-has-risen-to-115b/70320/ |title=MTA: Fulton Center Cost Has Risen to $1.15B |date=January 29, 2008 |website=The New York Sun|access-date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, the neighboring World Trade Center Hub's costs also rose from $2.2 billion to $3.4 billion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/nyregion/29fulton.html |title=Higher Costs May Curtail M.T.A.

===Station rehabilitation projects===
The Fulton Center project involved three station rehabilitation projects: the refurbishment of the Seventh Avenue Line's platform at the eastern end of the complex, served by the {{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh Brooklyn}}; the rehabilitation of the Lexington Avenue Line's platforms under Broadway, served by the {{NYCS trains|Lexington south}}; and the renovation of [[Cortlandt Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Cortlandt–Church Streets]], served by the {{NYCS trains|Broadway south}}. The former two stations had never been renovated, while Cortlandt Street had been renovated in the 1990s before being damaged during the September 11 attacks. The renovations of the Eighth Avenue Line platforms, served by the {{NYCS trains|Eighth Cranberry}}, and the Nassau Street Line platforms, served by the {{NYCS trains|Nassau south}}, had been completed in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=EIS1/&gt;{{rp|10}}

The first completed project of the Fulton Center, the rehabilitation of the Seventh Avenue Line platform, started in 2005.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The narrowness of this platform required the addition of extra circulation elements, such as stairs.&lt;ref name=EIS1/&gt;{{rp|11}} This project was completed by November 2006.&lt;ref name=capconstr /&gt;

Although not part of a rehabilitation, the Cortlandt Street station was first closed in 2005 for the construction of the [[Dey Street Passageway]], the underpass and the construction of the East Bathtub that supports the eastern towers of the [[World Trade Center (2001–present)|new World Trade Center complex]] that was being rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/12/nyregion/metro-briefing-new-york-manhattan-subway-station-to-close.html |title=Metro Briefing {{!}} New York: Manhattan: Subway Station To Close|last=O'Connor|first=Anahad|date=August 12, 2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 25, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the conclusion of the Dey Street Passageway construction, the uptown platform was opened first, in November 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ny1.com/7-brooklyn-news-content/news_beats/transit/109514/mta-chairman-to-re-open-r-w-cortlandt-street-station/ |title=MTA Chairman Reopens R/W Cortlandt Street Station |publisher=NY1 News |accessdate=November 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630094050/http://ny1.com/7-brooklyn-news-content/news_beats/transit/109514/mta-chairman-to-re-open-r-w-cortlandt-street-station/ |archivedate=June 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lowermanhattan.info/news/cortlandt_st_northbound_subway_21173.aspx |title=Cortlandt St Northbound Subway Platform Reopens |accessdate=November 22, 2009 |publisher=Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center/LMDC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130023107/http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/cortlandt_st_northbound_subway_21173.aspx |archivedate=November 30, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The southbound platform was rehabilitated and reopened on September 6, 2011 with a new underpass, to coincide with the upcoming opening of the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/zero_station_set_to_reopen_hzX7ruzYrrKOlWQoS80Z5M |title=G.

===Entrances===

As part of the reorganization of the Fulton Street station complex, and to mitigate passenger flow congestion during the construction phases of the Fulton Center project, some new entrances opened and some existing entrances closed. In January 2007, the MTA opened a new entrance on the southeast corner of [[Maiden Lane (Manhattan)|Maiden Lane]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. Like the John Street entrance, it served chiefly the northbound platform of the {{NYCS trains|Lexington south|apos=y}} platforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/mta_opens_new_45_62786.aspx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306023214/http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/mta_opens_new_45_62786.aspx |date=March 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That month, construction began on creating an analogous entrance on Cortlandt Street, just across the street from Broadway, for the southbound platform. These entrances allowed for the temporary closure of the John Street entrance (northbound platform) and the entrance by Dey Street (southbound platform) during the rehabilitation of the {{NYCS Lexington Brooklyn|time=nolink}} platforms and [[Dey Street Passageway]]-related work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/capital/fc_docs/070707_tc_cb1.pdf |title=Fulton Street Transit Center – Community Board 1 Quarterly Construction Update |last= |first= |date=July 7, 2007 |website= |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|access-date=February 21, 2018 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2011, the entrance at 135 William Street on the eastern side of the complex opened. This was completed in conjunction with the gradual opening of the {{NYCS Eighth far south express|time=nolink}} transfer mezzanine.&lt;ref name="MTA-135William-2011"&gt;{{cite web |title=news – New Entrance at Fulton Street Opens |website=MTA |date=August 1, 2011 |url=http://www.mta.info/news/2011/08/01/new-entrance-fulton-street-opens | access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shapiro |first=Julie |title=MTA Opens New Fulton Street Subway Entrance |website=DNAinfo New York |date=August 1, 2011 |url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20110801/downtown/mta-opens-new-fulton-street-subway-entrance |access-date=February 20, 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220092343/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20110801/downtown/mta-opens-new-fulton-street-subway-entrance |archivedate=February 20, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A terra-cotta mural and an iron gate from the [[Hotel McAlpin]], both which were originally found in the original transfer passageway, were relocated to the new 135 William Street entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A peek into the Fulton Street Transit Center |website=Downtown Express |date=January 4, 2012 |url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/2012/01/04/a-peek-into-the-fulton-street-transit-center/ | access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional entrance at 129 Fulton Street provides an elevator connecting to the {{NYCS Nassau south|time=nolink}} platform and the {{NYCS Eighth far south express|time=nolink}} mezzanine.&lt;ref name="MTA-135William-2011"/&gt;

To allow for advanced {{NYCS Eighth far south express|time=nolink}} Mezzanine work and the construction of a permanent underpass under the {{NYCS Lexington Brooklyn|time=nolink}} tunnel under Fulton Street to take place, the subway station entrance at 222 Broadway became permanently closed on October 29, 2011. In its place, a temporary entrance opened midblock between Fulton Street and John Street, inside the main building construction site. This was followed with a major realignment of the transfer passageway between the {{NYCS Eighth far south express|time=nolink}} and {{NYCS Lexington Brooklyn|time=nolink}} trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/mezzanine_work_reroutes_fulton_97791.aspx |title=Mezzanine Work Reroutes Fulton Transit Riders |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107194216/http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/mezzanine_work_reroutes_fulton_97791.aspx |archivedate=November 7, 2013 |accessdate=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related construction work saw the temporary closure of the entrances at Fulton Street, on the northwest (by St. Paul's Chapel) and southwest corners throughout much of 2011. Both were reopened by the first half of 2012. The entrance to Dey Street (195 Broadway), on the southbound platform, was permanently closed on May 1, 2012, for [[Dey Street Passageway]] related work and rehabilitation of the southbound platform. It was to be replaced by the Dey Street Headhouse, across Dey Street, when it opened in late September 2012.&lt;ref name=MTA-CB1-Update-Oct2012&gt;{{cite web |title=Fulton Street Transit Center – Community Board 1 Quarterly Construction Update |date=October 2012 |publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority |url=http://web.mta.info/capital/fc_docs/CB1_10_03%202012_Fulton%20_Center_Community_Board_1.pdf |accessdate=October 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

At the 129 Fulton Street site and the 150 William Street site are permanent entrances that provide access to the Broad Street-bound {{NYCS Nassau south|time=nolink}} trains and the {{NYCS Broadway-Seventh Brooklyn|time=nolink}} trains, respectively.

===IND transfer mezzanine===
[[File:A C transfer mezzanine in Fulton Center.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Newly completed passageway in the western half of the IND mezzanine, November 2014]]
[[File:Fulton St art 2 vc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Artwork on the walls of the eastern section the IND transfer mezzanine at the Fulton Center, facing the {{NYCS Eighth far south express|time=nolink}} platform.]]

Originally, a network of passageways and ramps loosely connected the various lines with each other, causing congestion during peak hours.&lt;ref name=EIS1/&gt;{{rp|11}} The transfer mezzanine, also known as the IND mezzanine, replaced these ramps and made several adjacent entrances redundant. In January 2010, reconstruction of the transfer mezzanine over the Fulton Street IND platform resulted in traffic flow changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Fulton Street Transit Center Construction Update and Service Changes January 9–11 and January 16–17 |url=http://mta.info/mta/news/releases/?en=100107-NYCT1 |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] |date=January 7, 2010 |accessdate=February 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer passageway leading to the [[Fulton Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]] platform at Fulton Street had previously been modified. Effectively, all transfers were made through the {{NYCS Eighth far south express|time=nolink}} platform.&lt;ref name=EIS1&gt;{{cite book |url=http://web.mta.info/capital/fc_docs/feis/chapters/ch01.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fulton Street Transit Center, Final Environmental Impact Statement and Section 4(f) Evaluation |chapter=Chapter 1: Purpose and Need |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] |accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stacked-staggered configuration of the {{NYCS Nassau south|time=nolink}} platforms splits the IND mezzanine levels into two halves. The eastern half stretches from Nassau Street to William Street, from the Broad Street-bound {{NYCS Nassau south|time=nolink}} platform to the {{NYCS Broadway-Seventh Brooklyn|time=nolink}} platform. Similarly, the western half of the mezzanine stretches from Nassau Street to Broadway, from the Jamaica Center-bound {{NYCS Nassau south|time=nolink}} platform to the {{NYCS Lexington Brooklyn|time=nolink}} platforms. Transferring passengers have to use the third-basement-level {{NYCS trains|Eighth far south express|time=nolink|apos=y}} platform to navigate between the two halves of the mezzanine, since the {{NYCS trains|Nassau south|time=nolink|apos=y}} platforms bisect the mezzanine on both the first and second basement levels.&lt;ref name=EIS1/&gt;{{rp|11}}

The IND mezzanine opened in various phases. Around August 2011, the William Street end of the Eastern mezzanine opened, coinciding with the opening of the 135 William Street entrance. In October 2011, due to a major realignment of the temporary transfer passageway between the {{NYCS Eighth far south express|time=nolink}} station and the {{NYCS Lexington Brooklyn|time=nolink}} station, parts of the Western Mezzanine opened as well. The realignment sent passengers through the construction site of the Fulton Building.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/capital/fc_docs/02%2013%202012%20Fulton%20Street%20Transit%20Center%20Manhattan%20Community%20Board%201%20Update.pdf |title=Fulton Street Transit Center – Community Board 1 Quarterly Construction Update |last= |first= |date=February 13, 2012 |website= |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|44}} By January 2012, the Western Mezzanine had opened to the Jamaica-bound {{NYCS Nassau south|time=nolink}} platforms. In June 2012, an underpass under the {{NYCS Lexington Brooklyn|time=nolink}} platforms, traveling approximately under Fulton Street, re-opened and was connected to the Western Mezzanine. With the opening of the new passageway, the older underpass connecting to southbound {{NYCS Lexington Brooklyn|time=nolink}} platform was simultaneously closed. As a result, the Western Mezzanine was substantially completed.&lt;ref name=MTA-CB1-Update-Oct2012/&gt;{{rp|2}} On August 2, 2012, the Broad Street-bound {{NYCS Nassau south|time=nolink}} platform was connected to the Eastern Mezzanine. An MTA press release regarded this as the substantial completion of the entire IND mezzanine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=MTA Re-Opens A,C Station Mezzanine Connection to Southbound J,Z Platform at Fulton Street Station | website=MTA | date=August 1, 2012 | url=http://www.mta.info/news/2012/08/01/mta-re-opens-ac-station-mezzanine-connection-southbound-jz-platform-fulton-street | access-date=March 1, 2018|quote=The re-opening of the transfer also allows for the last section of the reconstructed A &amp; C mezzanine to be opened, which is now completely open to customers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DSEO"/&gt;

{{Main|Dey Street Passageway}}

Temporary transfer passages opened to the {{NYCS Lexington Brooklyn|time=nolink}} trains from the {{NYCS Eighth far south express|time=nolink}} Mezzanine in October 2011, in conjunction with the closing of the entrance across the street on Fulton Street.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3}} In June 2012, this passageway was again replaced, this time by a permanent passageway underneath Fulton Street that adjoined the western {{NYCS Eighth far south express|time=nolink}} mezzanine directly. The original temporary transfer passageway was part of an underground concourse connecting the Fulton Center and the Dey Street Passageway, and also served a crossunder for the two platforms.&lt;ref name=MTA-DeyStHeadhouse-Oct2012/&gt;

===Fulton Building===
[[File:Fare control from John St and Dey Street in Fulton Building.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Fare control area]]

The main building for the Fulton Center project, referred to as the Fulton Building by the MTA in its Requests for Proposals in August 2012, is a three-story building clad in glass, with an [[oculus]] atop that draws natural light into the main building and the uptown platform of the {{NYCS Lexington Brooklyn|time=nolink}} station. It is designed by [[Nicholas Grimshaw]] and [[James Carpenter (architect)|James Carpenter Design Associates]]. Its construction replaced four buildings along the eastern side of Broadway, which were demolished during 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/broadway_demolition_begins_for_63247.aspx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306024027/http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/broadway_demolition_begins_for_63247.aspx |date=March 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fulton Building was nearly canceled in 2009 due to increasing costs,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; but was restored after $497 million in stimulus funding was allocated toward the Fulton Street Transit Center.&lt;ref name=NYT-Planning-Stimulus-2009/&gt; The foundations of the main transit complex was completed in August 2010.&lt;ref name=MTA-Const-Schedule-2011/&gt; Full scale superstructure work on the main building began in January 2011, and steel work concluded in October 2011.

The addition of retail space was an impetus for the May 2012 name change from "Fulton Street Transit Center" to a simpler "Fulton Center" to attract leases. The MTA looked to private companies to manage the retail section of the Fulton Center, attempting to change it to a shopping destination, as well as a transit center. The retail spaces are intended to provide additional revenue for the MTA in the form of real estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20120520/REAL_ESTATE/305209981 |title=The dish on Grand Central |author=Theresa Agovino |date=May 20, 2012 |work=Crain's New York Business |accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, the MTA made a motion to seek proposals from various companies for a master lease for 65,000 square feet of retail and commercial space. This space includes the Corbin Building, and the [[Dey Street Passageway]] and headhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/releases/?en=120731-HQ1 |title=MTA Seeks Proposals to Manage 65,000 Square Feet of Retail and Commercial Space at Fulton Center |publisher=Web.mta.info |accessdate=October 28, 2014 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MTA made a Requests for Proposals (RFP) on August 2, 2012.

===Corbin Building===
[[File:Corbin Building 13 John Street.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Corbin Building after renovation]]
{{main|Corbin Building}}

The [[Corbin Building]] is a landmark building located adjacent to the Fulton Building. Originally slated to be demolished, the building was instead restored as a part of the Fulton Center project and incorporated to the overall transit complex. It also provides street-level retail as well as {{convert|31,000|ft2|m2}} of commercial office space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dunlap |first=David W. |title=Spared Demolition, an 1889 Building Gets a Second Life |website=City Room |date=June 2, 2013 |url=//cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/spared-the-wreckers-an-ornate-1889-building-gets-a-second-life-downtown/ | access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was underpinned during the rehabilitation of the {{NYCS Lexington Brooklyn|time=nolink}} platforms and the transit building construction. Design elements and the historic decor and facade were preserved as a part of this project. The building as a whole is integrated into the project, with escalators at John Street descending to the {{NYCS Lexington Brooklyn|time=nolink}} platforms and the Fulton Building. Retail space returned to the ground floor when the Corbin Building reopened in December 2012.&lt;ref name=lowermanhattan17608 /&gt;

For upper floors, an interstitial structure was built for the height of the building, between the original building and the Fulton Center.

The Fulton Center project initially included upgrades to five subway stations:
* [[Fulton Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Fulton Street]] station on the {{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh Brooklyn}} on the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]]&lt;ref name=fultonalt&gt;{{cite web |title=Fulton Center |url=http://web.mta.info/capital/fulton_alt.html |work=MTA Capital Programs website |publisher=MTA |accessdate=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Fulton Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Fulton Street]] station on the {{NYCS trains|Eighth Cranberry}} on the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]]&lt;ref name=fultonalt/&gt;
* [[Fulton Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Fulton Street]] station on the {{NYCS trains|Nassau south}} on the [[BMT Nassau Street Line]]&lt;ref name=fultonalt/&gt;
* [[Cortlandt Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Cortlandt Street]] station on the {{NYCS trains|Broadway south}} on the [[BMT Broadway Line]]&lt;ref name=fultonalt/&gt;

The [[World Trade Center (PATH station)|World Trade Center PATH station]], as well as the following two New York City Subway stations, is also connected to the complex via the [[World Trade Center Transportation Hub]]. This also includes:
* [[WTC Cortlandt (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|WTC Cortlandt]] station on the {{NYCS trains|Broadway-Seventh South Ferry}} on the [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]]&lt;ref name=fultonalt/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-CortlandtReopens-2018/&gt;
* [[World Trade Center (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|World Trade Center]] station on the {{NYCS trains|Eighth far south local}} on the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]]&lt;ref name=fultonalt/&gt;

Despite the presence of a [[Dey Street Passageway|passageway]] linking the Fulton Street complex and the [[Cortlandt Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Cortlandt Street BMT station]], there is no free connection between the two stations. There are still paid transfers to the Fulton Street complex and the two Cortlandt Street stations.&lt;ref name="fultonstopens" /&gt; The connection is still possible via an out-of-system transfer through the WTC Transportation Hub. According to the MTA's Final Environmental Impact Statement, the Dey Street Passageway is intended to provide a seamless connection from the Fulton Center to the WTC Transportation Hub and [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|Brookfield Place]] (formerly the World Financial Center) without the need to cross Church Street and Broadway, both of which are busy traffic arteries in Lower Manhattan. By keeping it outside of the paid area, it would maximize pedestrian flow.&lt;ref name=EIS3&gt;{{cite book |url=http://web.mta.info/capital/fc_docs/feis/chapters/ch03.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fulton Street Transit Center, Final Environmental Impact Statement and Section 4(f) Evaluation |pages=3–21 |chapter=Chapter 3: Alternatives |publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] |accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genesis HealthCare''' is a provider of short-term post-acute, rehabilitation, skilled nursing and long-term care services. As of January 2017, Genesis operates approximately 500 skilled nursing centers and assisted/senior living residences in 34 states across the United States. Genesis also supplies rehabilitation therapy to approximately 1,700 healthcare providers in 45 states and the District of Columbia. Genesis has approximately 80,000 employees. Genesis HealthCare is headquartered in [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania]].

== History ==
Genesis Health Ventures was established by Michael R. Walker &amp; Richard R. Howard in 1985 with acquisition of nine centers. Between 1985 and 1998, Walker grew Genesis Health Ventures from a $32 million to a $2.4 billion public company through the acquisition of [[nursing homes]] and services such as rehabilitation therapy, diagnostic testing, respiratory therapy, and pharmacy.

In 1999, the federal government made cuts to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], which at that time funded virtually all the care for individuals admitted to Genesis Centers from hospitals. Genesis Health Ventures sought [[Chapter 11]] protection in 2000. In 2001, the company reorganized and reemerged from bankruptcy.

In 2003, Genesis Health Ventures separated the company's in-patient care and pharmacy divisions. As part of the separation, Genesis Health Ventures adopted the NeighborCare pharmacy division's trade name, and spun off the company's Genesis ElderCare Skilled Nursing Centers and Assisted Living and Independent Living Communities, as well as Genesis Rehabilitation Therapy Services, into a new entity – Genesis HealthCare Corporation.

NeighborCare, which traded on NASDAQ as NCRX, was acquired by [[Omnicare]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050728005535/en/Omnicare-Completes-Acquisition-NeighborCare Business Wire, Omnicare Completes Acquisition of NeighborCare]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 2007, Formation Capital and JER Partners completed the acquisition of Genesis HealthCare Corporation. The total [[enterprise value]] of the transaction was approximately $2.0 billion. Genesis' shareholders received $69.35 in cash for each share of Genesis' common stock that they held.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/health-SP/idUSN1341169620070716 Formation, JER buy Genesis Health for $1.52 bln | Reuters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2011, Health Care REIT, Inc. (now [[Welltower]]) completed the $2.4 billion acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets of privately owned Genesis HealthCare, which was previously announced on February 28, 2011. In June 2012, Genesis HealthCare announced its plans to acquire Sun Healthcare Group.

On December 1, 2012 Genesis completed the acquisition of Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. (Sun) (NASDAQ GS: SUNH).  Sun Healthcare was formally headquartered out of Irvine, California.  It operated skilled nursing facilities, assisted and independent living centers, and behavior health centers in 23 states. Sun also owned SunDance Rehabilitation, CareerStaff Unlimited and SolAmor Hospice.  Genesis acquired Sun for $8.50 per share.  The aggregate amount of the merger was approximately $215, excluding closing costs and the repayment of Sun debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Genesis HealthCare Acquires Sun Healthcare Group, Inc.|url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genesis-healthcare-acquires-sun-healthcare-group-inc-181866581.html|website = www.prnewswire.com|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genesis Healthcare merged with Skilled Healthcare Group Inc. which was based in Foothill Ranch, California on February 2, 2015. The combined company operated 500 skilled nursing and assisted/senior living communities in 34 states and more than 1,800 rehab therapy sites in 47 states. It reported over 90,000 employees with a combined revenue of $5.5 billion. The company changed its ticker from (NYSE: SKH) to (NYSE: GEN).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Genesis and Skilled Healthcare Group merger creates $5.5B post-acute care company - Philadelphia Business Journal|url = http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/blog/health-care/2015/02/genesis-and-skilled-healthcare-group-complete.html|website = Philadelphia Business Journal|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Genesis HealthCare acquired 24 skilled nursing facilities from [[Revera]], Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Genesis HealthCare Completes Previously Announced Transaction with Revera Inc.|url = https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genesis-healthcare-completes-previously-announced-transaction-with-revera-inc-300185779.html|website = www.prnewswire.com|accessdate = 2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cost per Genome.png|thumb|Since the [[Human Genome Project]] first sequenced the [[human genome]] from 1987 to 2004 at a cost of US$ 3 billion, costs have fallen precipitously, outpacing even [[Moore's law]], and were ≈US$1,000 in 2015. More widely available genome sequencing has led to more data on variants of uncertain significance.]]

'''''Good Value: Reflections on money, morality and an uncertain world''''' is a 2009 book by [[Stephen Green, Baron Green of Hurstpierpoint|Stephen Green]], the Chairman of [[HSBC]], written in response to the banking crisis.

He describes the book as "a journey of unfinished exploration" and suggests that deep personal and corporate values are essential for a sustainable revival of business. He suggests that "We need to be able to look ourselves in the mirror and ask two questions about our role in the global bazaar: how is what I am doing contributing to human welfare? And why am I specifically doing it?"&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Green, Good Value. Reflections on money, morality and an uncertain world, London 2009,179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews and comments==

* Chris Blackhurst in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' described it as "an intensely intimate, refreshing and at times searing read" and said it "should be required reading in business schools and boardrooms"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/article-23715502-details/Good+Value:+Reflections+on+Money,+Morality+and+an+uncertain+world+by+Stephen+Green/article.do Good Value: Reflections on Money, Morality and an uncertain world by Stephen Green] Evening Standard 3-July-09&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ruth Gledhill]] in ''[[The Times]]'' says "is a detailed analysis of the ethical and moral issues arising from the present economic crisis. It is not remotely didactic and it is mercifully free from the self-righteous pomposity that you might expect from a banker who is also an ordained clergyman."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article6571529.ece The Banker with God on his side] The Times 25-June-09&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lionel Barber]] in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' says the book "wrestles with the demands of individual responsibility and the market but it is set in a broader economic and historical context. Green’s ambition is to make the case for globalisation as an inevitable, progressive force and as a human phenomenon." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/224b507c-61de-11de-9e03-00144feabdc0.html Lunch with the FT: Stephen Green] 26-June-09&lt;/ref&gt;
* Boyd Tonkin in ''[[The Independent]]'' raises two cheers for a book that "strides fluently between [[T.S. Eliot]] and [[Karl Marx]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Adam Smith]] and the Prophet [[Isaiah]], [[Amartya Sen]] and [[Teilhard de Chardin]], [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s operas in Beijing and [[Rajasthan]]i paintings at the [[British Museum]]" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/good-value-by-stephen-green-1758343.html Good Value by Stephen Green] [[The Independent]] 24-July-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' described the book as "an unusual and thoughtful disquisition on how to conduct oneself in a world of high finance and ambition, in ...the global bazaar."&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2009/06/26/the-thoughts-of-chairman-green/ The Thoughts of Chairman Green] [[Wall Street Journal]] Market Beat 26-June-09&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grace Church School''' is a private school whose original building is located at 86 [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Fourth Avenue]] between [[10th Street (Manhattan)|East 10th]] and [[12th Street (Manhattan)|East 12th Street]]s in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] neighborhood of the [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. The school was founded in 1894 by the [[Grace Church (New York)|Grace Church]] as the first [[choir]] [[boarding school]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=fednyc&gt;{{cite fednyc}}, p.136&lt;/ref&gt; The private day school, which much resembles the school today, began in 1934.&lt;ref name=fednyc /&gt; Grace Church School's High School Division opened in 2012 and is located at 46 Cooper Square. In the 2015-16 school year, the school opened for the first time as a Junior Kindergarten through 12th grade program.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Serena.

In 1947 Grace became a [[co-educational]] school and was admitted to the Guild of Independent Schools of New York City. In the following decade the school began to expand its facilities to accommodate a growing student body.  From the original 16 [[chorister]]s, Grace has grown to its current enrollment of more than 725 students drawn from a wide variety of ethnic, economic, and religious backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcschool.org/about-gcs/overview/index.aspx "Overview"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304004307/http://www.gcschool.org/about-gcs/overview/index.aspx |date=2011-03-04 }} on the Grace Church School website&lt;/ref&gt;

While the school has continued its close relationship with [[Grace Church (New York)|Grace Church]], since 1972 it has been governed by an independent [[Board of Trustees]], and it is a fully accredited member of the [[New York State Association of Independent Schools]] and the [[National Association of Independent Schools]]. Grace Church School is also a member of the [[National Association of Episcopal Schools]]. In 2006, the School became a legal entity separate from the Church, and now owns the buildings at 84-96 Fourth Avenue, including the historic and landmarked church houses Clergy House, Memorial House and Neighborhood House.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://gracechurchnyc.org/home/about/history/ "A History of Grace Church in New York"] on the Grace Church website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grace Church School's high school building is located in [[Cooper Square]]. It opened in 2011.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;Hollander, Sophia. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576508522327616998 "New School Sets Agenda"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (August 15, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Financial Congress (IFC)''' is a major annual conference dedicated to the finance industry. The event brings together heads of central and commercial banks, financial institutions, international financial organizations and financial regulatory authorities, as well as renowned experts from around the world and figures from academia and business. Since 1992, it has been held in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. 
Before 2016, the event was called the International Banking Congress (IBC).
Congress sessions are held in the form of interactive discussions, in which the most topical issues arising in the global banking and financial system are discussed.

== History ==
In the autumn of 1991, the first International Banking Congress was held in Frankfurt am Main, which was attended by [[Anatoly Sobchak]], the then Mayor of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], and Viktor Khalansky, who was in charge of the Main St. Petersburg Office of the [[Central Bank of Russia]]. In his speech, [[Anatoly Sobchak|Sobchak]] suggested that the next Congress be held in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]].

An initiative was put forward by the [[Central Bank of Russia]], and subsequently approved by the Russian government, to approach the world's leading banking institutions with the proposal to hold the International Banking Congress in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]].

The proposal gained support from representatives of leading banks, international banking and financial institutions, and audit firms.

On January 16, 1992, a non-governmental organization, named the Foundation for Support of the International Banking Congress, was established to facilitate the running of the congress. The organization was renamed the St. Petersburg Public Foundation for the Support of the International Banking Congress in 1998.

In April 1992, the first St. Petersburg-based International Banking Congress was held. The Congress was attended by over 350 participants from 50 countries. The Vice-Mayor of St. Petersburg was a member of the organizing committee for the first five International Banking Congress events. At present, the President of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] [[Vladimir Putin]] is a member of the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbk.spb.ru/en/about.php|title=The Saint-Petersburg Foundation for Support of International Banking Congresses (IBC)|website=www.mbk.spb.ru|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haoda was the human resources manager for New Britain Palm Oil Limited and operated a supermarket and liquor store in [[Kimbe]] before returning to his home province to build the successful [[March Girls Resort]] at [[Gaire]]. He was an unsuccessful candidate for [[Kairuku-Hiri District]] at the [[Papua New Guinean general election, 2007|2007 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Central people urged start | work=PNG Post Courier | date=30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He contested the Central Provincial seat at the [[Papua New Guinean general election, 2012|2012 election]] and ousted Governor [[Alphonse Moroi]]; initially elected as an independent, he immediately joined the governing [[People's National Congress (Papua New Guinea)|People's National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Wenge faces defeat | work=PNG Post-Courier | date=27 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Elections nearing close | work=PNG Post-Courier | date=26 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=PNC (22 Declared) | work=PNG Post Courier | date=27 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Las Vegas Club''' was a casino in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] established in 1930, and demolished in 2017.
==History==

===20th century===
John Wisner originally bought the property on the corner of Main and Fremont where the Las Vegas Club now stands, at a 1905 land auction for $1,750 and built the Overland Hotel.  In 1911 the Overland burnt to the ground and was rebuilt on the same location.
The Overland briefly became Frank Donovan's Chatterbox Club and Talk of the Town Bar.
The Las Vegas Club opened in 1930. The owner was J. Kell Houssels who installed the first [[neon sign]] on a hotel gambling establishment in 1931.  It was only the second neon casino sign in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dmla.clan.lib.nv.us/docs/MUSEUMS/reno/exneon/neontext.htm |title=Neon Lights |accessdate=2007-04-03 |work=Nevada Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Las Vegas Club was originally on the south side of [[Fremont Street]], at 21-23 Fremont,  midway between Main and 1st Street. It was right next to the [[Northern Club (casino)|Northern Club casino]], which became the [[La Bayou]] casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vintagelasvegas.tumblr.com/post/42104379238/las-vegas-club-northern-club |title= Las Vegas Club and Northern Club |accessdate=2015-01-10 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1949, J. Kell Houssels Sr. owner of the Las Vegas Club moved it across the street to 18 Fremont street, the site of the Overland Hotel, eventually expanding to its present location at the corner of Fremont and Main.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vintagelasvegas.tumblr.com/downtown |title=Vintage Las Vegas |accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Houssels then erected the famous Las Vegas Club sign on site, the tallest sign in town. The Overland Hotel continued to operate above the Club.
In 1961, Jackie Gaughan, Mel Exber and Larry Hazzlewood bought the Las Vegas Club and Houssels became majority shareholder in the Tropicana.

===21st century===
On December 6, 2002, owner [[Jackie Gaughan]] agreed to sell the Las Vegas Club and three other casinos, including the Plaza casino and [[Gold Spike Hotel and Casino|Gold Spike casino]], to [[Barrick Gaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secinfo.com/dR7Km.32Eu.d.htm |title=SEC Form 8-K |accessdate= |work= |publisher= |date= December 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrick was in partnership with the [[Tamares Group]].

January 2007 saw the opening of a new [[poker room]] in the casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://casinogambling.about.com/library/weekly/aa012301.htm |title= Birth Of A Poker Room |accessdate=2007-04-03 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, Tamares announced that it was considering converting the property into a high-rise [[condo-hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lvbusinesspress.com/articles/2007/03/26/news/iq_13273146.txt |title=Downtown Evolves |accessdate=2007-04-03 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This failed to happen, and in April 2013, the Las Vegas Club closed its hotel tower, leaving the casino open. The possibility of a future renovation of the hotel was hinted at, but never occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Mehaffey, John (9 April 2013). [http://www.4flush.com/casino-news/two-downtown-las-vegas-hotels-closing/13459 "Two Downtown Las Vegas Hotels Closing"]. ''4Flush''. Retrieved 26 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the Las Vegas Club announced its intent to open a 13,810-square-foot pharmacy on the eastern side of its casino.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Bradley (8 May 2015). [http://vegas.eater.com/2015/5/8/8573557/fremont-streets-las-vegas-club-to-be-chopped-in-two "Fremont Street's Las Vegas Club to be Chopped in Two"]. ''Las Vegas Eater''. Retrieved 7 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Those plans changed, in light of the August 14, 2015, announcement of the casino's sale to Derek and Greg Stevens, owners of the nearby D and Golden Gate casinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vegasinc.com/business/gaming/2015/aug/14/las-vegas-club-sold-owners-d-casino |last=Morris |first=J.D. |title=Las Vegas Club sold to owners of The D casino |accessdate=2015-08-14 |work=Vegas Inc. |date=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sale, The Las Vegas Club closed at midnight on August 19, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/las-vegas-club-close-midnight-wednesday |last=Stutz |first=H. |title=Las Vegas Club to close at midnight Wednesday |accessdate=2015-08-20 |work=Las Vegas Review Journal. |date=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building along with the former [[Mermaids Casino]] and Glitter Gulch strip club were demolished over the course of 2017 to make way for a new resort expected to open in 2020.

==Brightstar==
[[Brightstar Corporation|Brightstar]] was founded in Miami in 1997, as a distributor and service provider to the wireless industry with a focus on the Latin American market.  The company opened offices in Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and the Caribbean. In 2000, the company entered distribution agreement with Motorola for all of Latin America. This was followed by the launch of subsidiaries in Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and El Salvador. A US Brightstar subsidiary opened in 2001, based in Chicago, and later expanded into Asia, followed by Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Brightstar operates in approximately 50 countries and all six continents around the globe. ''Forbes Magazine'' recognized it as one of the largest privately held companies in the US, listing it 55th in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Forbes America's Largest Private Companies 2013|url=https://www.forbes.com/largest-private-companies/#page:6_sort:0_direction:asc_search: }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inc.

According to the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), no agreed-upon definition of maximum output exists.

[[File:Resume.pdf|thumb|Sample résumé outline for a college student]]
A '''résumé''' or '''resume'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|r|ɛ|z|ʊ|ˌ|m|eɪ|,_|ˈ|r|eɪ|-|,_|ˌ|r|ɛ|z|ʊ|ˈ|m|eɪ|,_|ˌ|r|eɪ|-}} {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|r|ɛ|zj|ʊ|m|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|ʁezyme|lang}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=résumé|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9|dictionary=Merriam-Webster Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a document used by a person to present their backgrounds and skills. Résumés can be used for a variety of reasons, but most often they are used to secure new employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/resume |title=Resume &amp;#124; Define Resume at Dictionary.com |website=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical résumé contains a "summary" of relevant job [[experience]] and [[education]], as its French origin implies. The résumé is usually one of the first items, along with a [[cover letter]] and sometimes an application for employment, which a potential [[employer]] sees regarding the job seeker and is typically used to [[Screening (economics)|screen]] applicants, often followed by an [[interview]].

The [[curriculum vitae]] (CV) used for employment purposes in the UK (and in other European countries) is more akin to the résumé—a shorter, summary version of one's education and experience—than to the longer and more detailed CV that is expected in U.S. academic circles.

Generally, the résumé is substantially shorter than a CV in [[English Canada]], the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle |first=Alison |url=http://jobsearch.about.com/cs/curriculumvitae/f/cvresume.htm |title=The Difference Between a Resume and a Curriculum Vitae |website=Jobsearch.about.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, [[biodata]] is often used in place of a résumé.&lt;ref name="Sehgal2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=M. K.|title=Business Communication|year=2008|publisher=Excel Books |language=English|isbn=9788174465016|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As has been indicated above, the word résumé comes from the French word {{lang|fr|résumé}} meaning "summary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Merriam-Webster| accessdate=9 March 2015| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resume| title=resume| quote=French résumé, from past participle of résumer to resume, summarize, from Middle French resumer}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is credited with the first résumé, though his "résumé" takes the form of a letter written about 1481–1482 to a potential employer, Ludovico Sforza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pratt|first1=Síofra|title=3 Lessons Every Job Seeker Can Learn from the World’s Oldest CV|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141015111116-2417166-3-lessons-every-job-seeker-can-learn-from-the-world-s-oldest-cv|publisher=[[LinkedIn]]|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Skills of Leonardo da Vinci|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/03/skills-of-da-vinci.html|website=Lettersofnote.com|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next roughly 450 years, the résumé continued to be a mere description of a person, and included their abilities and past employment. In the early 1900s, résumés listed things like weight, height, marital status, and religion. It was not until 1950 that the résumé evolved into something more than words written on scraps of paper. By then, résumés were considered very much mandatory, and started to include information like personal interests and hobbies. It was not until the 1970s, the beginning of the [[Digital Age]], that résumés took on a more professional look in terms of presentation and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-resumes-have-evolved-since-their-first-creation-in-1482-2011-2|title=The 500-Year Evolution Of The Resume|newspaper=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In many contexts, a résumé is typically limited to one or two pages of size [[ISO 216|A4]] or [[Letter paper|letter-size]], highlighting only those experiences and qualifications that the author considers most relevant to the desired position. Many résumés contain [[Index term|keywords]] or [[skills]] that potential employers are looking for via [[applicant tracking system]]s, make heavy use of active verbs, and display content in a flattering manner. Acronyms and credentials after the applicant's name should be spelled out fully in the appropriate section of the résumé, greater chance of being found in a computerized keyword scan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/how-to-create-an-hr-resume.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Résumés can vary in style and length, but should always contain accurate contact information of the job seeker. A recent hiring simulation by ResumeGo concluded that a two-page resume was more likely to lead to being hired than a one-page resume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cbsnews.com/news/your-one-page-resume-may-be-killing-your-job-search/|title=Your one-page resume may be killing your job search|last=Ivanova|first=Irina|date=|website=CBS News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A résumé is a marketing tool in which the content should be adapted to suit each individual job application or applications aimed at a particular industry. The transmission of résumés directly to employers became increasingly popular as late as 2002. {{citation needed|date=February 2010}} Job seekers were able to circumvent the [[application for employment|job application]] process and reach employers through direct email contact and résumé blasting, a term meaning the mass distribution of résumés to increase personal visibility within the job market. However, the mass distribution of résumés to employers can often have a negative effect on the applicant's chances of securing employment as the résumés tend not to be tailored for the specific positions the applicant is applying for. It is usually, therefore, more sensible to optimize the résumé for each position applied for and its keywords. In order to keep track of all experiences, keeping a 'master résumé' document is recommended, providing job-seekers with the ability to customize a tailored résumé while making sure extraneous information is easily accessible for future use if needed.

The complexity or simplicity of various résumé formats tends to produce results varying from person to person, for the occupation, and to the industry. Résumés or CVs used by medical professionals, professors, artists and people in other specialized fields may be comparatively longer. For example, an artist's résumé, typically excluding any non-art-related employment, may include extensive lists of [[Solo exhibition|solo]] and group [[Art exhibitions|exhibitions]].

==Styles==
Résumés may be organized in different ways. The following are some of the more common résumé formats:

===Reverse chronological résumé===
A reverse chronological résumé lists a candidate's job experiences in chronological order, generally covering the previous 10 to 15 years. Positions are listed with starting and ending dates. Current positions on a résumé typically list the starting date to the present. The reverse chronological résumé format&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Reverse Chronological Resume Format: Focusing on Work History, Growth - For Dummies|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/reverse-chronological-resume-format-focusing-on-w0.html|website = Dummies.com|accessdate = 22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is most commonly used by those who are not professional résumé writers. In using this format, the main body of the document becomes the Professional Experience section, starting from the most recent experience and moving chronologically backwards through a succession of previous experience. The reverse chronological résumé works to build credibility through experience gained, while illustrating career growth over time and filling all gaps in a career trajectory. A chronological résumé is not recommended to job seekers with gaps in their career summaries. In the United Kingdom the chronological résumé tends to extend only as far back as the applicant's [[GCSE]]/[[Standard Grade]] qualifications.

===Functional résumé===
A functional  résumé lists work experience and skills sorted by skill area or job function.

The functional résumé is used to focus on skills that are specific to the type of position being sought. This format directly emphasizes specific professional capabilities and utilizes experience summaries as its primary means of communicating professional competency. In contrast, the chronological résumé format will briefly highlight these competencies prior to presenting a comprehensive timeline of career growth through reverse chronological listings, with the most recent experience listed first. The functional résumé works well for those making a career change, having a varied work history or with little work experience. A functional résumé is also preferred for applications to jobs that require very specific skills or clearly defined personality traits. A functional résumé is a good method for highlighting particular skills or experiences, especially when those particular skills or experiences may have derived from a role which was held some time ago. Rather than focus on the length of time that has passed, the functional résumé allows the reader to identify those skills quickly.

===Hybrid résumé===
The hybrid résumé balances the functional and [[chronological]] approaches. A résumé organized this way typically leads with a functional list of job skills, followed by a chronological list of employers. The hybrid has a tendency to repeat itself and is, therefore, less widely used than the other two.

===Online résumés===
As the search for employment has become more electronic, it is common for employers to only accept résumés electronically, either out of practicality or preference. This has changed much about the manner in which résumés are written, read, and processed. Some career experts are pointing out that today a paper-based résumé is an exception rather than the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20140620-to-print-or-not-to-print |title=To Print Or Not To Print |last=Garone |first=Liz |date=23 June 2014  | website=bbc.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many employers now find candidates' résumés through [[search engine]]s, which makes it more important for candidates to use appropriate keywords when writing a résumé. Larger employers use [[Applicant tracking system|Applicant Tracking Systems]] to search, filter, and manage high volumes of résumés. Job ads may direct applicants to email a résumé to a company or visit its website and submit a résumé in an electronic format.

Many employers, and recruitment agencies working on their behalf, insist on receiving résumés in a particular [[file format]]. Some require [[Microsoft Word]] documents, while others will only accept résumés formatted in [[HTML]], [[PDF]], or plain [[ASCII]] text.

Another consideration for electronic résumé documents is that they are parsed with [[Natural language processing|natural language processors]]. [[Resume parsing|Résumé parsers]] may correctly interpret some parts of the content of the résumé but not other parts. The best résumé parsers capture a high percentage of information regarding location, names, titles, but are less accurate with skills, industries and other less structured or rapidly changing data. Résumés written in a standard format are more likely to be correctly interpreted by résumé parsers, and thereby may make the candidate more findable.

One advantage for employers to online résumés is the significant cost saving compared to traditional hiring methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.careerjournal.com/hrcenter/weddlesguide/19990405-weddle.html |title=Career Advice, Find a Job &amp; Salary Trends - Wall Street Journal |website=Careerjournal.com |date=2002-10-03 |accessdate=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that potential employers no longer have to sort through massive stacks of paper.

===Infographic, video and website résumés===
As the Internet becomes more driven by multimedia, job-seekers have sought to take advantage of the trend by moving their résumés away from the traditional paper and email media.

[[Video resume|Video]], infographic, and even [[Vine (service)|Vine]] résumés have gained popularity, though mainly in the creative and media industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-resumes-that-got-worldwide-attention-194410148.html |title=10 Resumes That Got Worldwide Attention |last=Shontell |first=Alyson |date=27 February 2013  | website=finance.yahoo.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend has attracted criticism from [[human resources management]] professionals, who warn that this may be a passing fad and point out that multimedia-based résumés may be overlooked by recruiters whose [[workflow]] is designed only to accommodate a traditional résumé format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2012/05/18/recruiters-tell-us-do-resume-fads-really-work/ |title=Recruiters Tell Us: Do Résumé Fads Really Work? |date=18 May 2012  | website=forbes.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Résumé evaluation==
Many résumé development agencies offer résumé evaluation services wherein they evaluate the résumé and suggest any necessary changes. Candidates are free to either do those changes themselves or may take help of the agency itself. Some career fields include a special section listing the lifelong works of the author: for computer-related fields, the [[softography]]; for musicians and composers, the [[discography]]; for actors, a [[filmography]].

Keeping résumés online has become increasingly common for people in professions that benefit from the multimedia and rich detail that are offered by an HTML résumé, such as actors, photographers, graphic designers, developers, dancers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/cv/actorcv.htm |title=How to Write an Actor's/Singer's CV | website=Kent University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Job seekers are finding an ever-increasing demand to have an electronic version of their résumé available to employers and professionals who use [[Internet recruiting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/05/07/cb.e.resume/index.html?iref=nextin |title= An E-friendly Résumé in 5 Easy Steps |last=Presely |first=Eric |date=8 May 2008  | website=cnn.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Online résumé distribution services have emerged to allow job seekers to distribute their résumés to numerous employers of their choice through email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/workinglife/the-future-of-the-resume/2269763 |title= The Future of the Resume|last=Burdick |first=Cody |date=17 March 2016  | website=Tampa Bay Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Résumé as one part of a personal branding mix==
In some sectors, particularly in the [[Startup company|startup]] community, use of traditional résumé has seen a consistent decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/is-the-resume-dead/article18988834/ |title=Is The Resume Dead? |last=Lawrence |first=Daina |date=5 June 2014  | website=forbes.com |accessdate= 25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While standalone résumés are still used to apply for jobs, job-seekers may also view their résumés as one of a number of assets which form their [[personal branding|personal brand]] and work together to strengthen their job application. In this scenario, résumés are generally used to provide a potential employer with factual information (e.g., achievements), while the social media platforms give insight into the job-seekers' motivations and personality in development.

'''Springpad''' was a free [[online application]] and [[web service]] that allowed its registered [[User (computing)|users]] to save, organize and share collected ideas and information. As users added content to their Springpad accounts, the application automatically identified and categorized it, then generated additional snippets based on the types of objects added—for example, listing price comparisons for products and showtimes for movies.

Springpad was also available as apps on the [[iPad]], [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] that synchronized with the Web interface. Springpad was bundled on new [[Toshiba]] notebook computers through a Web application subscription service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.toshiba.com/offers/24716 apps.toshiba.com The Essentials] Retrieved January 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2014, Springpad announced that it would cease operations on June 25, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://springpad.com/blog/2014/05/announcement-springpad-shutting-down] Retrieved May 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The company then allowed users to export their data (as [[json]] and read-only [[html]] formats), or to automatically migrate it to [[Evernote]] accounts before the expiration date.

== Features ==
Springpad users could use the main site interface which uses [[HTML5]] from most browsers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/214975/five_great_free_business_apps_for_google_chrome.html |title=Five Great Free Business Apps for Google Chrome |accessdate=December 29, 2010 |last=Thomas |first=Keir |date=December 27, 2010 |work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; or use the smartphone app to capture notes, tasks, or lists which were then added to the user's "My Stuff", the user's personal database or collection. Additionally Springpad let users look up items of interest which were then automatically categorized based on type or manually categorized by the user. Category types included recipes, movies, products, restaurants and wine. Events could also be added to Springpad, and if the user used [[Google Calendar]], they could opt to sync the event to it.

In addition to the smartphone app and site, Springpad could be used via browser [[Google Chrome Extensions|extension]] for [[Google Chrome]], or the Springpad Clipper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.springpadit.com/2010/02/springpad-clipper/ |title=Get the Springpad Clipper |accessdate=December 29, 2010 |work=blog.springpadit.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[bookmarklet]] to analyze webpages and clip relevant information from them—for example, the ingredients needed for a recipe—or to add the site as a normal bookmark. Another way users could add content to their Springpad "My Stuff" was by emailing entries to an email address specified on Springpad registration.

Springpad's smartphone apps could be used to scan barcodes to identify products, save them to the user's "My Stuff", and automatically generate additional product information and links. The mobile app could also save images taken with the phone's camera, and locate nearby businesses.

With most of the content added to a user's "My Stuff", relevant news, useful links and other helpful information could be viewed. Users could also attach additional notes and images to content they had already saved, and could add reminders and alerts which could be emailed to the user or texted to their phone. Springpad also added alerts to its own Alerts section for relevant news, deals or coupons for specific products users added.

For additional organization, anything added to Springpad could also be [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]]. Users could also add entries to "Notebooks" to separate content by projects, or any other way they wished. Each Notebook included a section called a "Board", which acted as a [[pin board]] where users could "pin" content they'd added to the Notebook, allowing them to visually lay out items. If the user added a map to the Board and had entries that included an address, Springpad could automatically point out entries on the map.

By default, everything added to Springpad was private. However users could change the privacy settings for each of the types of items added, decide to make specific items public and shareable on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], add them to their public page, or keep them private but links to them with specific people.

==History==

===1984-99: Founding and early years===
[[File:Bill Clinton talking at TED 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Clinton]] addresses TED, 2007]]
TED was conceived in 1984 by architect and graphic designer [[Richard Saul Wurman]], who observed a [[technological convergence|convergence]] of the fields of technology, entertainment, and design (that is, "TED").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tatvasoft world of inspiring people and their ideas |url=https://www.ted.com/profiles/5778538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first conference, organized by Harry Marks and Wurman in the same year, featured demos of the [[compact disc]], co-developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] and one of the first demonstrations of the [[Apple Macintosh]] computer.&lt;ref name="addict"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum"&gt;Cadwalladr, Carole [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jul/04/ted-conference-oxford-carole-cadwalladr Ted – the ultimate forum for blue-sky thinking] July 4, 2010, [[The Guardian]], Retrieved September 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations were given by famous mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] and influential members of the [[digerati]] community, like [[Nicholas Negroponte]] and [[Stewart Brand]].

From 1990 onward, a growing community of "TEDsters" gathered annually at the event in California State University Monterey Bay, until 2009, when it was relocated to [[Long Beach, California]] due to a substantial increase in attendees.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Victoria|title=Long Beach to host influential TED conference|date=January 16, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/16/business/fi-ted16|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the speakers had been drawn from the fields of expertise behind the acronym TED, but during the nineties, the roster of presenters broadened to include scientists, philosophers, musicians, religious leaders, philanthropists, and many others.&lt;ref name="ted.com"/&gt;

In 2000, Wurman, looking for a successor at age 65, met with new-media entrepreneur and TED enthusiast [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] to discuss future happenings. Anderson's UK media company [[Future plc|Future]] bought TED. In November 2001, Anderson's non-profit The [[Sapling Foundation]] (motto: ''"fostering the spread of great ideas."'')&lt;ref name="sapling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/pages/42 |title=About TED: Who we are: Who owns TED |work=TED: Ideas Worth Sharing |publisher=TED Conferences, LLC |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; acquired TED from Future for £6m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/i-was-losing-1-million-a-day-every-day-for-18-months-meet-chris/|title='I was losing $1 million a day, every day for 18 months': Meet Chris Anderson, the man behind TED talks|date=April 29, 2016|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, Anderson gave a TED Talk in which he explained his vision of the conference and his future role of [[curator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/chris_anderson_shares_his_vision_for_ted.html|title=TED's nonprofit transition|last=Anderson|first=Chris|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wurman left after the 2002 conference.

In 2006, attendance cost was $4,400 per person and was by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/about/invitations|title=Getting Invited (attendees)|work=TED: Ideas Worth Spreading|publisher=TED Conferences, LLC|accessdate=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membership model was shifted in January 2007 to an annual membership fee of $6,000, which includes attendance of the conference, club mailings, networking tools, and conference DVDs. The 2018 conference was $10,000 per attendee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/attend/conferences/ted-conference#h3--ted-conference-standard-membership|title=TED Conference|website=www.ted.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the conference was relocated to Vancouver.

TED is currently funded by a combination of various revenue streams, including conference attendance fees, corporate sponsorships, foundation support, licensing fees, and book sales. Corporate sponsorships are diverse, provided by companies such as [[Google]], [[General Electric|GE]], [[AOL]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[The Coca-Cola Company]], among others. Sponsors do not participate in the creative direction of the event, nor are they allowed to present on the main stage, in the interests of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How TED Works|url=https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/how-ted-works|website=TED.com|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=americanu&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ochoa|first1=Rosmari|title=Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED): A case study on how complimentary on- and off-line approaches can build community and cultivate platformsfor innovation and creativity|url=https://www.american.edu/soc/communication/upload/Rosemari-Ochoa.pdf|website=American University School of Communication|publisher=American University|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TED staff consists of about 180 people headquartered in [[New York City]] and [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/about/our-organization/who-we-are|title=Who we are - Our organization - About - TED|website=TED.com|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TED Prize==
The TED Prize was introduced in 2005. Until 2010, it annually granted three individuals $100,000 and a "wish to change the world".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Giussani]].  [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruno-giussani/ted-2008-day-2-dave-egger_b_89106.html "Day 2: Dave Eggers and Tutoring, Neil Turok and the next African Einstein, Karen Armstrong and the Charter for Compassion"], ''Huffington Post'', February 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Each winner unveils their wish at the main annual conference. Since 2010, in a changed selection process, a single winner is chosen to ensure that TED can maximize its efforts in achieving the winner's wish. In 2012, the prize was not awarded to an individual, but to a concept connected to the current global phenomenon of increasing [[urbanization]]. In 2013, the prize amount was increased to $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tedprize.org/|title=TED Prize {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.tedprize.org|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TED Prize winners in previous years:

In 2005, Chris Anderson hired [[June Cohen]] as Director of TED Media. In June 2006, after Cohen's idea of a TV show based on TED lectures was rejected by several networks, a selection of talks that had received the highest audience ratings was posted on the websites of TED, [[YouTube]], and [[iTunes]], under [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0.&lt;ref name="giving"&gt;{{cite web |title=Giving Away Information, but Increasing Revenue |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/technology/16ecom.html |publisher=NYT |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/tedtalksdirector|title=TED|work=YouTube|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, only a handful of talks were posted, to test if there was an audience for them. In January of the next year, the number of TED Talks on the site had grown to 44, and they had been viewed more than three million times. On the basis of that success, the organization pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into its video production operations and into the development of a website to showcase about 100 of the talks.&lt;ref name="giving"/&gt;

In April 2007, the new TED.com was launched, developed by design firm Method. In subsequent years, the website has won many prizes, among which seven [[Webby Award]]s, iTunes' "Best Podcast of the Year" (2006-2010), the [[Communication Arts (magazine)|Communication Arts]] Interactive Award for "Information Design" in 2007, the OMMA Award for "video sharing" in 2008, the Web Visionary Award for "technical achievement" in 2008, [[The One Club|The One Show Interactive]] Bronze Award in 2008, the [[AIGA]] Annual Design Competition (2009), and a [[Peabody Award]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bibliotech.stanford.edu/conf11_speakers|title=2011 Speakers {{!}} BiblioTech Program|website=bibliotech.stanford.edu|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://method.com/about/awards|title=Work|website=Method|access-date=June 18, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807060646/http://method.com/about/awards|archivedate=August 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/ted.com|title=TED.com|website=www.peabodyawards.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TED Review|publisher=[[MacWorld]]|url=http://www.macworld.com/appguide/app.html?id=707209|date=December 22, 2009|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---Not sure if is exactly the right link.

As of January 2018, over 2600 TED talks had been posted.&lt;ref name="numbertalks"/&gt; Every week 5-7 new talks are published. In January 2009, the then number of videos had been viewed 50 million times. In June 2011, the number of views totaled 500 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/06/27/ted-anniversary/|title=With 500 Million Views, TED Talks Provide Hope for Intelligent Internet Video|last=Kessler|first=Sarah|website=Mashable|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on November 13, 2012, TED reached its billionth video view.&lt;ref name="billion"/&gt; Chris Anderson in an interview in March 2012:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It used to be 800 people getting together once a year; now it's about a million people a day watching TED Talks online. When we first put up a few of the talks as an experiment, we got such impassioned responses that we decided to flip the organization on its head and think of ourselves not so much as a conference but as "ideas worth spreading," building a big website around it. The conference is still the engine, but the website is the amplifier that takes the ideas to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.departures.com/articles/teds-chris-anderson|title=TED’s Chris Anderson|website=Departures|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2012, [[Netflix]] announced a deal to [[streaming media|stream]] an initial series of 16 two-hour shows, consisting of TED Talks covering similar subjects, from multiple speakers. The content was made available to subscribers in the US, Canada, Latin America, the UK, and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/03/15/netflix-to-stream-ted-talks/|title=Netflix To Stream TED Talks|last=Savitz|first=Eric|website=Forbes|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosted by Jami Floyd, ''[[TED (conference)#TED.com|TED Talks NYC]]'' debuted on [[NYC Media|NYC Life]] on March 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TED TALKS IN NYC –FEATURING WORLD-RENOWNED TALKS FROM TED.COM – PREMIERES ON NYC LIFE |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/news/tedtalksinnycpremieres.shtml |accessdate=January 17, 2012 |newspaper=.nyc.gov |date=March 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103151258/http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/news/tedtalksinnycpremieres.shtml |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEDGlobal===
In 2005, under Anderson's supervision, a more internationally oriented sister conference was added, under the name TEDGlobal. It was held, in chronological order: in [[Oxford]], [[UK]] (2005), in [[Arusha]], Tanzania (2007, titled TEDAfrica), in Oxford again (2009 and 2010), and in [[Edinburgh]], UK (2011, 2012, and 2013).

===TED Translators (formerly The Open Translation Project (OTP))===
TED Translators started as TED Open Translation Project in May 2009 and aims to "[reach] out to the 4.5 billion people on the planet who don't speak English", according to TED Curator Chris Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/OpenTranslationProject|title=TED Open Translation Project|publisher=|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OTP utilizes crowd-based subtitling platforms to translate the text of TED and TED-Ed videos, as well as to caption and translate videos created in the TEDx program (with its technology partner [[dotSUB]] until May 2012, and then with [[open source]] translation tool [[Amara (subtitling)|Amara]]). At the time of the launch, 300 translations had been done by 200 volunteer transcribers in 40 languages.&lt;ref name="TED"/&gt; In May 2015, over 70,000 sets of subtitles in 107 languages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/participate/translate/otp-2014-annual-report|title=2014 annual report: TED Open Translation Project {{!}} Translate {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been completed by (an all-time total of) 38,173 volunteer translators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amara.org/en/teams/ted/|title=Dashboard - TED {{!}} Amara|website=www.amara.org|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project contributed to a significant increase in international visitors to TED's website, with traffic from outside the US growing 350 percent, 600 percent growth in Asia, and more than 1000 percent in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/at-1-year-anniversary-teds-open-translation-project-celebrates-more-than-7000-completed-translations-from-4000-volunteers-in-75-languages-93683249.html|title=At 1-Year Anniversary, TED's Open Translation Project Celebrates More Than 7,000 Completed Translations From 4,000 Volunteers in 75 Languages|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEDx===
{{See also|List of TEDx conferences}}
TEDx are independent TED-like events, which can be organized by anyone who obtains a free license from TED, agreeing to follow certain principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/fashion/26TEDX.html|title=A Conference Makes Learning Free (and Sexy)|last=Rosenbloom|first=Stephanie|date=September 24, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEDx events are non-profit but may use an admission fee or commercial sponsorship to cover costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/view/id/493#general-rules|title=TEDx Rules {{!}} Before you start {{!}} Organize a local TEDx event {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, speakers are not paid. They must also relinquish the copyrights to their materials, which TED may edit and distribute under a [[Creative Commons]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mypages.iit.edu/~tedxiit/|title=TEDxIIT|website=mypages.iit.edu|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TEDx event is organized by volunteers from the local community, and just like TED events, it lacks any commercial, religious, or political agenda. Its goal is to spark conversation, connection, and community.

As of January 2014, the TEDxTalks library contained some 30,000 films and presentations from over 130 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/|title=TED {{!}} TEDx Events {{!}} TEDxTalks|website=tedxtalks.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2012/06/19/heres-why-ted-and-tedx-are-so-incredibly-appealing-infographic/2/|title=Here's Why TED and TEDx are So Incredibly Appealing (infographic)|author=Mark Fidelman|date=June 19, 2012|work=Forbes|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2017, the TEDx archive surpassed 100,000 talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ted.com/achievement-unlocked-tedx-celebrates-100000-talks/|title=Achievement unlocked: TEDx celebrates 100,000 talks!|date=October 19, 2017|work=TED Blog|access-date=October 30, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, eight TEDx events were organised every day; raised up from five in June 2012, the previous year, in 133 countries.&lt;ref name="listen"&gt;Heller, Nathan [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/07/09/120709fa_fact_heller ''Listen and Learn''], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', July 9, 2012.

===TED Fellows===
[[File:TEDGlobal2012.jpg|thumb|TEDGlobal 2012 at the [[Edinburgh International Conference Centre]]]]
TED Fellows were introduced in 2007, during the first TEDAfrica conference in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]], where 100 young people were selected from across the continent. Two years later, during TEDIndia, 99 Fellows were recruited, mainly from South Asia. In 2009, the Fellows program was initiated in its present form. For every TED or TEDGlobal conference, 20 Fellows are selected; a total of 40 new Fellows a year. Each year, 20 past Fellows are chosen to participate in the two-year Senior Fellows program (in which they will attend four more conferences).

Acceptance as a Fellow is not based on academic [[credential]]s, but mainly on past and current actions, and plans for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/pages/248|title=Application tips {{!}} Apply to be a TED Fellow {{!}} TED Fellows Program {{!}} Participate {{!}} TED|website=www.ted.com|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides attending a conference free of charge, each Fellow takes part in a special program with [[mentorship|mentoring]] by experts in the field of spreading ideas, and he or she can give a short talk on the "TED Fellows" stage. Some of these talks are subsequently published on TED.com. Senior Fellows have additional benefits and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/18/tedglobal-fellows|title=Wired meets 2011's TED Fellows|last=Rowan|first=David|date=July 18, 2011|website=Wired|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720175312/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/18/tedglobal-fellows|archive-date=July 20, 2011|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TED-Ed===
TED-Ed is a category of TED talks which are short animated lessons aimed at children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ed.ted.com/about|title=Lessons Worth Sharing|website=TED-Ed|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It creates explanatory animation videos on various concepts. TED-Ed lessons are created in collaboration with educators and animators. Current advisers for Ted-Ed lessons include [[Aaron Sams]], Jackie Bezos, John Hunter, [[Jonathan Bergmann]], [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Sir Ken Robinson]], [[Melinda Gates|Melinda French Gates]], and [[Sal Khan|Salman Khan]].

===TEDMED===
{{Main|TEDMED}}

[[TEDMED]] is an annual conference concerned with health and medicine. It is an independent event operating under license from the nonprofit TED conference.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/tedmed_a_new_pa/|title=TEDMED: a new partnership|date=January 19, 2010|website=TED Blog|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TEDMED was founded in 1998 by TED's founder Ricky Wurman. After years of inactivity, in 2008 Wurman sold TEDMED to entrepreneur [[Marc Hodosh]], who recreated and relaunched it. The first event under Hodosh's ownership was held in San Diego in October 2009. In January 2010, TED.com began including videos of TEDMED talks on the TED website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The second Hodosh-owned edition of TEDMED took place in October 2010, also in San Diego.  It sold out for a second year and attracted notable healthcare leaders and Hollywood celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDMED|title=Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne with Nathaniel Pearson at TEDMED 2010|date=December 8, 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX0culYjU_A|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Jay S. Walker|Jay Walker]] and a group of executives and investors purchased TEDMED from Hodosh for $16 million with future additional payments of as much as $9 million. The conference was then moved to Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

He said that it is unacceptable that TED, which is a non-profit organization, charges attendees $6,000 but cannot afford to pay anything to their speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/futures-exchange/why-im-not-a-tedx-speaker-3be652b8eccb|title=Why I'm Not a TEDx Speaker|last=Swain|first=Frank|date=November 8, 2013|website=Medium|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers at the independently-organized TEDx talks may not be paid; speakers at the official, yearly, TED Conference are compensated for their talks.

[[Sarah Lacy]] of ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' and ''[[TechCrunch]]'' wrote in 2010 that TED attendees complained of elitism from a "hierarchy of parties throughout the LA-area with strict lists and security" after the sessions. She gave TED credit for making talks free online or live streamed.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/09/ted-now-with-more-elitism/|title=TED: Now with More Elitism?|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TED Talk content===
Disagreements have also occurred between TED speakers and organizers. In her 2010 TED Talk, comedian [[Sarah Silverman]] referred to adopting a "retarded" child. TED organizer [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] objected via his [[Twitter]] account, leading to a Twitter skirmish between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/14/ted-organizer-trashes-speaker-fails-social-iq-test/|title=TED Organizer Trashes Speaker, Fails Social IQ Test|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/15/the-ted-v-sarah-silverman-fight-turns-really-retarded/|title=The TED v.

Also in 2010, noted statistician [[Nassim Taleb]] called TED a "monstrosity that turns scientists and thinkers into low-level entertainers, like circus performers."

Following a TEDx talk by [[Rupert Sheldrake]], TED issued a statement saying their scientific advisors believed that "there is little evidence for some of Sheldrake's more radical claims" made in the talk and recommended that it "should not be distributed without being framed with caution". The video of the talk was moved from the TEDx YouTube channel to the TED blog accompanied by the framing language called for by the advisors. The move and framing prompted accusations of censorship, to which TED responded by saying the accusations were "simply not true" and that Sheldrake's talk was "up on our website".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/19/the-debate-about-rupert-sheldrakes-talk/ |title=The debate about Rupert Sheldrake's talk |publisher=TED |date=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bignell, Paul |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/ted-conference-censorship-row-8563105.html |title=TED conference censorship row |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TED has also been accused of censoring a presentation by [[Graham Hancock]] in which he discussed the effects of legal versus illegal drugs, by removing it from YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/04/11/ted-bans-graham-hancocks-talk-on-consciousness/|title=Banned TED Talk: Graham Hancock – The War on Consciousness|publisher=|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor [[Benjamin H. Bratton|Benjamin Bratton]] at [[University of California, San Diego]], TED Talks' efforts at fostering progress in socio-economics, science, philosophy, and technology have been ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/30/we-need-to-talk-about-ted "We need to talk about TED"], Prof. Benjamin Bratton, ''The Guardian'', December 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Anderson responded that some critics have a misconception of TED's goals, and failed to recognise that TED aimed to instill excitement in the audience in the same way the speaker felt it. He stated that TED only wishes to bring news of the significance of certain topics to a large audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/08/ted-not-civilisational-disaster-but-wikipedia "TED is not a recipe for civilisational disaster"], Chris Anderson, ''The Guardian'', January 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Atlas of Economic Complexity''''' is a 2011 economics book by [[Ricardo Hausmann]], [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]], Sebastián Bustos, Michele Coscia, Sarah Chung, Juan Jimenez, Alexander Simoes and Muhammed A. Yıldırım. A revised 2014 edition is published by the [[MIT Press]].&lt;ref name="Hausmann 2013 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Hausmann | first=Ricardo | title=The atlas of economic complexity : mapping paths to prosperity | publisher=The MIT Press | publication-place=Cambridge, MA | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-262-52542-8 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book attempts to measure the amount of productive knowledge that each country holds, by visualizing the differences between national economies. The book's originality is to go beyond standard statistics by making use of “complexity statistics” of 128 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/3fc2975c-4703-11e1-bc5f-00144feabdc0.html|title='The tricky business of measuring growth'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book concludes with hints "at how difficult and complex it may be for government planners to kick-start a new industry — while showing that there are new industries that will struggle to get started without help.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/05/15/magazine/art-of-economic-complexity.html?_r=0|title='The art of economic complexity'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is accompanied by an [http://atlas.media.mit.edu/ online website] which hosts interactive visualizations featured in the book.

The Atlas was a collaboration between the [[Center for International Development at Harvard University]] and the Macro Connections group at the [[MIT Media Lab]].

==Online Visualizations==

The visualizations presented in the Atlas where created in [[The Observatory of Economic Complexity]] (OEC), a data visualizations engine created by Alex Simoes and [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]] in the Macro Connections group at the MIT Media Lab. The Observatory of Economic Complexity was launched in 2011. In 2013, Harvard's Center for International Development released a version of the OEC entitled the [http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/ Atlas online]. The Harvard version also builds on the original code base developed by Alex Simoes at the MIT Media Lab.

The data are from the following data sources, cleaned and made compatible:

* 1962–2000: The Center for International Data from Robert Feenstra
* 2001–2011: UN COMTRADE

'''''The Corporate Machine''''' (known in Europe as '''''Business Tycoon''''') is a [[strategy video game|strategy]] [[computer game]] from [[Stardock]] in which the goal is to create a [[corporation]] in one of four [[industries]] ([[automobile]]s, [[aircraft]], [[computer]]s, or [[soft drink]]s) and eventually dominate rival companies. To win the player must dominate the chosen market (getting 55% to 65% of the market share depending on the number of opponents). The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon, which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur, all developed by Stardock.

== Gameplay ==

=== Starting Out ===
When starting a game, the player picks a company specialty. Three specialties are available: [[marketing]], [[Labour (economics)|labor]] and [[research]]. Each specialty doubles productivity in that area. After picking a specialty, the start screen allows choice of how many opponents to be faced, the difficulty of the game, what map will be used (both real and fictional maps are available), starting funds, and what industry is to be competed in.

=== Exploring ===
The game is started at the home site (which is randomly chosen on the map) and with one sales executive. To introduce and sell the product to other regions, the region must be investigated. This process can take from 3 to 10 weeks depending on how far they are from the sites. After an area is explored, the player will know the market leader, if opponents have sites or units there, if the region has a resource, as well as statistics like what the targeted area desires in a product, their concerns with price, and how rich the region is.

=== The Sales Executives ===
The sales executives increase market penetration (the percentage of stores carrying the product) in their regions and all regions up to two spaces away from each executive. The sales executive can be moved around the map freely by plane; however, while in transit he will not grant any penetration benefit. To gain more sales executives the profit must be increased to a certain level by the end of a year. This gets harder later on as the amount to gain a new executive increases. It is also possible to get them through the use of Direct Action Cards.

=== Your Company Sites ===
These places are the player's base of operations. Manufacturing, research, and marketing buildings can be built and upgraded. Additional sites can be purchased but they become progressively more expensive. On the player's first site there will be a sales office and a garage, but every site after will only have a sales office and everything else has to be built. Other buildings include an intelligence facility, which will generate and display information in the form of graphs. Company stores can be built at any site to decrease employee expenses (and therefore lower employee cost).

To get better performance a training center will increase employee efficiency. Employee happiness becomes a factor as well, as an unhappy employee's performance will suffer, so a recreation center will boost morale. If market leadership is lost in an area where a site is, the employees' morale will drop sharply. Marketing, manufacturing, and researching buildings can be accessed in order to make adjustments to the multiple operations within the company. Sales buildings act similarly to sales executives that cannot be moved from region to region.

=== The Marketing Department ===
When a marketing building is built, it will be possible to hire and fire marketers. Marketing associates can be used to create marketing campaigns. As campaigns are created, marketing associate availability drops and the player is forced to build more marketing buildings in order to have more campaigns. These buildings can be upgraded to have more employees and to have more powerful marketing campaigns. Positive campaigns will boost the qualities of the player's product, or negative marketing campaigns to decrease the appeal of an opponents product. For media, there are advertisements to print, and radio and television campaigns. Marketing campaigns can be moved from region to region similarly to a sales executive.

=== The Manufacturing ===
Starting with a simple garage, the player can upgrade to factories. Larger factories, and hire of additional employees, increase efficiency. Employees can be hired or fired as demand rises or falls. The production screen is where the price of the product is set. If the product is better compared to other companies then an overcharge can be made. The price should not be raised too far as demand will drop quickly if there are different companies in the same area and market leadership could be lost.

=== Research ===
This is where scientists develop new technologies to upgrade the product. The bigger the research building, the more scientists can be hired. Four projects can be queued so the player does not have to constantly have to come back to the screen and choose new technologies. Different projects also give different bonuses, such as decreasing the cost to manufacture or increase the appeal to consumers.

=== Direct Action Cards ===
Different regions may or may not have a resource in them. There are five resource types: Labor, Government, Intelligence, Marketing, and Underworld. Every year that a region is controlled that has a resource is one resource point. Having resource points allows the play of direct action cards.

The game is started with two cards and an additional card is received every year. Direct action cards cost resources, and may have a monetary cost in addition. Cards have effects such as receiving money from the government, a research boon, revealing large blocks of regions, twisting the desires of consumers, physical destruction of competitors assets, cutting costs through illegal activities, and publicity boosts. The direct action card system has been likened to the card game [[Magic: The Gathering]].

== Community ==
The Corporate Machine’s popularity has decreased over the years since the game was first introduced. Recently a fan of the game (known as Money) has tried to reunite the TCM community by creating a forum, tutorials, help, and support.

The problem that the community is facing is that Stardock's TCM server (which allows users to play online) is down often, disabling internet play.

The community is considering creating a new, more reliable server on which to play (see external links).

'''Sir Thomas Edwin "Tom" Clark''' (6 August 1916 – 14 June 2005) was a New Zealand industrialist who played a major role in a number of different enterprises. He was a patron of New Zealand's involvement in international yachting.&lt;ref name="NZH obit"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pickmere |first1=Arnold |title=Obituary: Tom Clark |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10331273 | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the driving force in the development of [[Crown Lynn]], a ceramics manufacturer begun by his great-grandfather [[Rice Owen Clark]] in the mid 1850s. 

==Early life and family==
Clark was born in [[Hobsonville]] on 6 August 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19160810.2.2.2 | title=Births | date=10 August 1916 | work=New Zealand Herald | accessdate=20 February 2016 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was also called Thomas Edwin Clark and his mother was Margaret Clark (née Morison).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/SiteCollectionDocuments/buildingpropertyconsents/resourceconsents/notifiedconsentdocuments/various-squadrondrive-14-dukehouseconservationplan.pdf |title=Clark Cottage, Hobsonville, Auckland: a conservation plan |date=August 2012 |first= |last=David Pearson Architects |accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[King's College, Auckland|King's College]] in [[Auckland]] but was pulled out of school in 1931 during the [[Great Depression]], as the family could not afford the school fees, and was sent to work in the family's brick works instead.

Clark married three times and had nine children.&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt;

==Business career==
During [[World War II]], the country started running out of cups and saucers, as they were no longer imported and had never been manufactured locally at a grand scale. Clark Jr. started experimenting with mass production and built a tunnel kiln after reading as much about it as he could. Initially, he did not know how to attach handles successfully, and the Crown Lynn Potteries brand had a reputation into the 1950s for handles that broke off. By 1948, more than half of the company's production was sold to Australia, but when the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]], [[Walter Nash]], changed the [[exchange rate]] by 25%, that overseas market was "lost overnight".&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt; The company had a supply contract with the [[New Zealand Railways Department]], and the railway cup and saucer are regarded as "one of the most famous Kiwi icons of the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cup and saucer|url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/object/68824|publisher=[[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]]|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Crown Lynn was changed to Ceramco in 1974, and the company diversified into areas like electronics and the wholesale of appliances. The lingerie company, Bendon, was purchased at that time. The pottery part of the business was shut down in 1989 due to cheap imports.&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt; Clark retired from Ceramco in 1993, after 62 years with the business.&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt;

==Honours==
Clark was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[1986 New Year Honours]] for services to manufacturing, export, sport and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |date=30 December 1985 |supp=y |issue=50362 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, Clark was presented the [[Freedom of the City#Key to the City|Key to the City]] from [[Bob Harvey (mayor)|Bob Harvey]], the [[mayor of Waitakere City]].&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt;

==Death==
Clark died on 14 June 2005&lt;ref name="Cemetery search"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waitakere.govt.nz/cnlser/cm/cemeterysearch/cemeterydetails.aspx?id=75763 |title=Cemetery search |date= |website= |publisher=Auckland Council |accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was survived by his third wife, Patricia, Lady Clark.&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt; His funeral service was held at [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland|Holy Trinity Cathedral]] in [[Parnell, New Zealand|Parnell]],&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt; and he was cremated at [[Waikumete Cemetery|Waikumete Crematorium]].&lt;ref name="Cemetery search"/&gt;

'''Tsvetan Vasilev''' (also spelled Tzvetan Vassilev; {{lang-bg|Цветан Василев}}; born 1959) is a former [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]] entrepreneur nowadays fugitive from the Bulgarian court. He was indicted for the embezzlement of billions of Corpbank with 17 other accomplices but is now sued in absentia. The reason is that he refuses to stand before the Bulgarian court and hides in Belgrade [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-corpbank-trial/bulgaria-files-indictment-in-1-5-billion-corpbank-embezzlement-probe-idUSKBN1A51HM Reuters reports]. Besides being sued in Bulgaria for the Corpbank affair also known as the "Robbery of the century", he is being investigated in Serbia for deliberate bankruptcy of a glass factory in Parachin, financed by Corpbank while the bank was still under the control of Vassilev [https://www.blic.rs/vesti/drustvo/bugarski-tajkun-trazi-zastitu-u-srbiji-ortak-tome-nikolica-pokusava-da-se-spase/v92lhjq here]. According to the Serbian publication "Blic" Vasilev is being investigated also by the Austrian authorities.

== Allegations and Trial ==

The indictment for the syphoning off of Corporate Commercial Bank was filed by the Specialized Prosecutor’s Office on 20 July 2017, Bulgarian National TV reported [https://www.bnt.bg/en/a/18-people-indicted-for-the-corpbank-siphoning-off here]. All copies of the indictment include more than 210,000 pages. 18 persons have been indicted, including Tzvetan Vasssilev who is being sued as the mastermind of the organised crime group whose activity syphoned off the bank. The charges pressed against the convicts exceed 5,000 pages. More than 400 witnesses have been interviewed. Over 90 expert’s reports have been prepared by 27 experts. The collected evidence is in 1,360 volumes. Among the indicted is the former deputy governor of Bulgaria’s central bank (BNB), Tzvetan Gounev, along with the former CEOs of the bank.

== Years of Bloom ==

Vasilev is former chairman of the supervisory board of [[Corporate Commercial Bank]] AD, the fifth bank in Bulgaria based on assets, which collapsed after a bank run in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnb.bg/BankSupervision/BSCreditInstitution/BSCIFinansReports/BSCIFRBankingSystem/BS_201307_BG Official website of the Bulgarian National Bank (the central bank of Bulgaria)] {{bg icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its majority shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corpbank.bg/managment_Tzvetan-Vassilev_3.html Official website of Corporate Commercial Bank AD] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927075300/http://corpbank.bg/managment_Tzvetan-Vassilev_3.html |date=2013-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tsvetan Vasilev is also former chairman of the supervisory board of Victoria FATA Insurance&lt;ref&gt;[http://victoria-insbg.com/en/?load=AboutUs Official website of Victoria FATA Insurance] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the supervisory board of Vivacom, a Bulgarian telecom company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vivacom.bg/en/residential/about_us/supervisory_board Official website of Vivacom] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasilev is the recipient of the badge of honor of the [[University of National and World Economy]] in Sofia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwe.bg/en/pages/305/honorary-titles-.html Honorary Titles, Official website of the University of National and World Economy] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Doctor Honoris Causa]]'' of the "St Ivan Rilski" University of Mining and Geology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.bg/article?id=164906 Corporate Commercial Bank AD Gives Two Annual Awards to Top Geology Students, ''Monitor'' newspaper, 31 July 2008. Retrieved 8 September 2013.] {{bg icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Bulgaria's prosecution indicted Vasilev with embezzlement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prb.bg/bg/news/aktualno/specializiranata-prokuratura-predade-na-sd-18-lica/ Official website of the Prosecutor's Office of Republic of Bulgaria] {{bg icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 2014, Vasilev has been living in exile in Serbia where he faces extradition proceedings &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapool.bg/srabskite-magistrati-otkazaha-da-ekstradirat-tsvetan-vasilev-news231534.html Сръбските магистрати отказаха да екстрадират Цветан Василев, казусът се връща на първа инстанция, съобщиха от Апелативния съд в Белград, ''Mediapool'' newspaper, 11 March 2015.

== Education ==
Tsvetan Vasilev holds a master's degree in International Economic Relations from the University of National and World Economy. After graduation, he worked as a research fellow in economics at the Center of Foreign Trade and International Markets for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spisanie.manager.bg/broi-120/menidzhmant/nay-skapite-klienti The Dearest Clients, ''The Manager'' magazine, October 2008. Retrieved 27 August 2013.] {{bg icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==

Tsvetan Vasilev started his career in finance in 1992 when he founded his brokerage company Bromak EOOD&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bromak.eu/ Bromak EOOD official website] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his investment intermediary Fina-S AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fina-s.com/инвестиционен-посредник_0&amp;lang=en Fina-S AD official website] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 1999 he headed the Foreign Exchange Operations and Liquidity Department of Central Cooperative Bank, and in 1997 he also became member of the bank's board of directors. In 1999 he left Central Cooperative Bank to head the Markets and Liquidity Department at CB Bulgaria Invest (now Allianz Bulgaria Commercial Bank).

== Corporate Commercial Bank ("Corpbank") ==
Between 2000 and 2003, Vasilev served as chairman of the executive board and executive director of Corporate Commercial Bank AD. In 2003 he became its majority shareholder and chairman of its supervisory board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corpbank.bg/managment_Tzvetan-Vassilev_3.html Corporate Commercial Bank AD official website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927075300/http://corpbank.bg/managment_Tzvetan-Vassilev_3.html |date=2013-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entrepreneurial and innovative investments ===
By 2014, Corpbank was Bulgaria’s fourth-largest bank.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/bulgaria-lawsuit-idUSL5N16P5MS|title=UPDATE 1-Bulgaria files $1.3 bln lawsuit against Corpbank's main shareholder|date=2017-03-17|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank held an extensive portfolio of companies and was the only bank in Bulgaria investing in start-ups and entrepreneurs. Because the bank was making these types of investments that no other banks were doing, its profits and regional power grew. Until its destruction by Bulgarian regulators and the looting of its assets, Corpbank was arguably the most innovative and entrepreneurial bank in the Balkans.

Starting from scratch in 2001, it was a pioneer in [[Trade finance|export financing]] to Bulgarian [[Energy industry|energy]] producers and [[ammunition]] manufacturers previously without banking options. Unlike its rivals, Corpbank also made direct investments in its clients and emerging enterprises in Bulgaria, most notably the country's leading telecom [[Vivacom]], which it bought from [[creditor]]s along with affiliates of [[VTB Capital]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-08-13|title=VTB Capital, Corpbank Seek 73% in Bulgarian Telco Vivacom|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-299551788.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/vtb-corporate-bank-affiliates-buy-94-stake-in-vivacom-1-.html VTB, Corporate Bank Affiliates Buy 94% Stake in Vivacom, bloomberg.com, November 2012] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivacom is the leading market provider in Bulgaria for a variety of telecommunications services, including [[landline]], [[Mobile phone|mobile]], Internet, radio, and TV. It has approximately 3,500 employees.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Vassilev saw the opportunity and raised the capital to make the purchase.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://readrussia.com/2016/02/11/vtb-capital-faces-fraud-accusations-in-the-uk-over-handling-of-a-loan/|title=VTB Capital Faces Fraud Accusations in the UK Over Handling of a Loan {{!}} Russia! Magazine|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts claim that the Vivacom deal was amidst the most complicated ones on the Bulgarian financial market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boyanov.com/en/news/3964/ BOYANOV&amp;Co. Advises on “Probably the Most Complicated Deal in Bulgaria Ever”, 6 September 2012, boyanov.com] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restructuring was approved by the [[European Commission]] and the international creditors of [[Vivacom]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-12/vtb-corporate-bank-affiliates-buy-94-stake-in-vivacom-1-.html VTB, Corporate Bank Affiliates Buy 94% Stake in Vivacom, bloomberg.com, 12 November 12 2012] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/06/vivacom-restructuring-idUSL6E8K6D6R20120906 Bulgaria's Vivacom gets court approval for restructuring, reuters.com, 6 September 2012] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the acquisition by Vasilev and VTB Capital, Vivacom had incurred significant debt after a buyout by AIG in 2007, which subsequently sold its shares to PineBridge Investments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/28/bulgaria-vivacom-idUSL5N0AX6L220130128 Majority Owners of Bulgaria Telco Vivacom Make Buyout Offer, reuters.com, 28 January 2013. Retrieved 23 September 2013.]{{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's 2013 financial report showed considerable improvement: EBITDA increased from BGN 267 million to BGN 339 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s2.vivacom.bg/files/financial_reports/33/document/(31.12.13)%20VIVACOM%202013%20results%20presentation%20(published%20on%20March%2004,%202014).pdf|title=2013 Financial Report|last=|first=|date=|website=s2.vivacom.bg|publisher=Vivacom|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Sudden" run on the bank ===
Because of its growth, wealth, and power, in April 2014 one of the most influential political parties in Bulgaria ([[Movement for Rights and Freedoms|DPS]]) visited Vassilev. The request was simple: transfer assets for free to the "[[Bulgarian mafia|mobster circle]] of DPS." Vassilev refused.

Suddenly, by June and July 2014, Corpbank customers withdrew cash in a panic. Prior to the bank run, several Bulgarian media outlets ran stories accusing Vassilev of trying to organize the murder of a media titan who had close connections to the government, [[Delyan Peevski]]. Prosecutors raided companies affiliated with Corpbank. They confiscated financial documents from those companies. TV stations ran live feeds of the prosecution's raids. Over the course of 4 days, over 20 percent of Corpbank's assets were withdrawn in cash by depositors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2015/10/05/bulgarias-failed-corpbank-the-former-owners-story/#5ba58e37e794|title=Bulgaria's Failed Corpbank: The Former Owner's Story|last=Coppola|first=Frances|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the bank run, Corpbank was closed for six months. Customers could not get money out. The Bulgarian government's currency board denied the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) from creating money to pay Corpbank's customers. According to Forbes, "Paying off depositors was therefore impossible. But reopening the bank was not an option either since that would simply re-start the run. Therefore, the BNB kept the bank "on ice".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Bank collapse and shutdown ===
In late 2014, the bank collapsed which caused the largest [[financial crisis]] in Bulgaria since the 1990s. Bulgaria’s central bank, [[Bulgarian National Bank]], then took control over the bank. Corpbank was officially shut down and its assets taken over by the Bulgarian National Bank in July 2014. According to media reports at that time, the shutdown was due to a dispute between Vassilev and "Bulgarian media oligarch Delyan Peevski."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Civil and criminal charges ===
In March 2016, the Bulgarian government (through the Commission for Illegal Assets Forfeiture (CIAF)) filed a lawsuit against Vassilev as the main shareholder of Corpbank. The lawsuit accuses Vassilev of using bank money to personally acquire assets and property. The government’s lawsuit seeks 2.2 billion [[Bulgarian lev|leva]], which is equivalent to $1.3 billion US dollars.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Vassilev blames the failure of the bank on a plot hatched by his competitors and the government, ultimately to gain control over the wealthy telecommunications company [[Bulgarian Telecommunications Company|Vivacom]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In December 2016, Bulgarian and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] courts froze over 600 million levs of Vassilev’s money.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The government is also going after Vassilev and his wife, charging both with money laundering. His wife is a university professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europost.bg/article?id=11769|title=Vassilev and spouse investigated for money laundering|website=europost.bg|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending some time in [[Austria]], Vasilev is currently residing in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] (he voluntarily surrendered to Serbian police officers on 16 September 2014). In March 2015, the Appellate Court of Belgrade ruled against an extradition request by the Bulgarian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapool.bg/srabskite-magistrati-otkazaha-da-ekstradirat-tsvetan-vasilev-news231534.html Сръбските магистрати отказаха да екстрадират Цветан Василев, казусът се връща на първа инстанция, съобщиха от Апелативния съд в Белград, ''Mediapool'' newspaper, 11 March 2015. Retrieved 16 March 2015.] {{bg icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Delyan Peevski is simply one of the main tools that the Bulgarian political mafia uses to blackmail Bulgarian business—the visible part of a rather large iceberg of corruption," Vassilev said in a ''Forbes'' interview. "The political mafia is persistently trying to downgrade what happened to Corpbank to a personal conflict between Mr. Peevski and me, which is utterly untrue. I had a conflict with the political mafia ruling the country, which has been blackmailing and threatening me for many years."&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2015/10/05/bulgarias-failed-corpbank-the-former-owners-story/#5ba58e37e794|title=Bulgaria's Failed Corpbank: The Former Owner's Story|last=Coppola|first=Frances|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After inexplicably modifying charges several times, in July 2017 Bulgaria's prosecution indicted Vasilev with embezzlement along with 17 other people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prb.bg/bg/news/aktualno/specializiranata-prokuratura-predade-na-sd-18-lica/ Official website of the Prosecutor's Office of Republic of Bulgaria)] {{bg icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Reuters, the case is "seen as one of the Balkan nation’s biggest post-communist fraud investigations".
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-corpbank-trial/bulgaria-files-indictment-in-1-5-billion-corpbank-embezzlement-probe-idUSKBN1A51HM|title=Bulgaria files indictment in $1.5 billion Corpbank embezzlement probe|website=reuters.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasilev, however, argues that the charges are political.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=htps://sofiaglobe.com/2018/03/27/bulgarian-court-denies-defence-motion-to-dismiss-ccb-embezzlement-lawsuit/|title= Bulgarian court denies defence motion to dismiss CCB embezzlement lawsuit|website=sofiaglobe.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has submitted applications against Bulgaria before the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2015/10/05/bulgarias-failed-corpbank-the-former-owners-story/#5ba58e37e794|title=Bulgaria's Failed Corpbank: The Former Owner's Story|last=Coppola|first=Frances|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, he also submitted an application under the US [[Magnitsky Act]], which sanctions corrupt government officials implicated in human rights abuses, against Bulgaria's General Prosecutor [[Sotir Tsatsarov]] and media mogul and Member of Parliament [[Delyan Peevski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/opinion/international/350503-in-bulgaria-global-magnitsky-act-sanctions-could-make-a-real-difference|title=In Bulgaria, Global Magnitsky Act could make a real difference|website=thehill.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corpbank's assets after the forced shutdown===

After Corpbank's shutdown, insolvency proceedings were officially initiated. Corpbank's clients, however, repeatedly warned that Bulgaria's authorities were violating the creditors' interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glasove.com/categories/skandalyt/news/osnovnite-modeli-za-ograbvane-na-masata-na-nesystoyatelnostta-v-ktb/|title=Основните модели за ограбване на масата на несъстоятелността в КТБ|publisher=glasove.com|language=Bulgarian|date= 29 November 2017|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media reported that assets were deviated by companies and persons allegedly affiliated with [[Delyan Peevski]] and the witnesses against Vasilev.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://frognews.bg/novini/eto-koi-aktivi-ktb-zagrabi-jertvata-peevski.html|title= Ето кои активи на КТБ заграби "жертвата" Пеевски|publisher= frognews.bg| language= Bulgarian|date=22 August 2017|access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://frognews.bg/obshtestvo/underground/biser-lazov-podstaveni-litsa-vzima-102-miliona-ktb.html|title= Бисер Лазов с подставени лица взима още 102 милиона от КТБ|publisher=frognews.bg|language= Bulgarian|date=9 November 2017|access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://frognews.bg/obshtestvo/underground/svideteli-ulichiha-biser-lazov-grandiozni-dalaveri-aktivi-ktb.html|title= Свидетели уличиха Бисер Лазов и Ко в грандиозни далавери с активи на КТБ|publisher=frognews.bg| language= Bulgarian| date=16 January 2017|access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasilev also argues that Bulgarian authorities close their eyes to irregularities in the insolvency proceedings. He was concerned about the fate of Corpbank's strategic assets, such as [[Vivacom]]. In particular, VTB Capital controlled 33% of Vivacom through their daughter company ''Crusher'' even though they were not the true owner as the price of the shares had already been paid by Corpbank's SPV ''Technological Center-Institute for Microelectronics (TC-IME)''.&lt;ref name="Истината за Виваком"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://clubz.bg/30239-istinata_za_vivakom_razkaz_ot_cvetan_vasilev|title= Истината за "Виваком"|publisher=clubz.bg| language= Bulgarian| date=9 November 2015|access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In murky circumstances, the shares of Vivacom were sold by VTB Capital at a devalued rate at a tender in London to Bulgarian Spas Rousev in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.capital.bg/biznes/kompanii/2016/09/02/2821528_spas_rusev_v_btk_vremenen_stopanin_5/|title= Спас Русев в БТК: Временен стопанин №5|publisher=capital.bg| language= Bulgarian| date=2 September 2016|access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is pending litigation before the London High Court for allegedly illegal seizure of the equity stake in Vivacom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://readrussia.com/2016/03/28/bulgarias-vivacom-shareholder/|title= Bulgaria’s Vivacom Shareholder Sues VTB for Alleged Fraud|publisher=Read Russia| date=28 March 2016|access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasilev has raised concern that Vivacom's new owners would probably fail to pay the company's debt to Corpbank and would hurt the interests of the creditors in the insolvency proceedings.&lt;ref name="Истината за Виваком"/&gt; It has been suggested that Spas Rousev is a strawman of Delyan Peevski.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://glasove.com/categories/skandalyt/news/spas-rusev-i-peevski-v-otchayan-opit-da-legitimirat-krazhbata-na-btk|title= Спас Русев и Пеевски в отчаян опит да легитимират кражбата на БТК|publisher=glasove.bg| language= Bulgarian| date=9 January 2017|access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, Vasilev had tried to strike a deal with a Belgian investor who was supposed to find financing for Vivacom's debt towards Corpbank, but it fell through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnt.bg/en/a/lic33-bought-a-stake-in-telecom-operator-vivacom-and-five-other-bulgarian-companies|title=LIC33 BOUGHT A STAKE IN TELECOM OPERATOR VIVACOM AND FIVE OTHER BULGARIAN COMPANIES|last=site.meta-author|website=BNT News|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2015/07/27/lic33-pulls-out-of-vivacom-deal/|title=LIC33 pulls out of Vivacom deal|publisher=TeleGeography|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Slavery}}

'''Wife selling''' is the practice of a husband selling his wife and may include the sale of a female by a party outside a marriage. Wife selling has had numerous purposes throughout the practice's history; and the term "''wife sale''" is not defined in all sources relating to the topic.

Sometimes, a wife was sold by a husband to a new husband as a means of divorce, in which case sometimes the wife was able to choose who would be her new husband, provided she chose within a certain time period, and especially if the wife was young and sexually attractive. In some societies, the wife could buy her own way out of a marriage or either spouse could have initiated this form of divorce. Reducing a husband's liability for family support and prenuptial debts was another reason for wife sale. Taxes were sometimes paid by selling a wife and children and paying the value as the required amount, especially when taxes were too high to permit basic survival. Famine leading to starvation was a reason for some sales. Gambling debts could be paid by selling a free or slave wife. A society might not allow a woman the rights reserved to men regarding spouse sale and a society might deny her any rights if her husband chose to sell her, even a right of refusal. A divorce that was by mutual consent but was without good faith by the wife at times caused the divorce to be void, allowing her to then be sold. A husband might sell his wife and then go to court seeking compensation for the new man's adultery with the wife. By one law, adultery was given as a justification for a husband selling his wife into concubinage.

A free wife might be sold into [[chattel slavery|slavery]], such as if she had married a [[serfdom|serf]] or her husband had been murdered. Sometimes, a slave-master sold an enslaved wife. Enslaved families were often broken up and wives, husbands, and children sold to separate buyers, often never to see each other again, and a threat to sell a wife was used to keep an enslaved husband under a master's discipline. In wartime, one side might, possibly falsely, accuse the other of wife sale as a method of spying. A wife could also be treated as revenue and seized by the local government because a man had died leaving no heirs. ''Wife sale'' was sometimes the description for the sale of a wife's services; it might be for a term of years followed by freedom. If a sale was temporary, in some cases wife sale was considered temporary only in that the sold-and-remarried wife would, upon her death, be reunited with her first husband.

Constraints existed in law and practice and there were criticisms. Some societies specifically forbade wife sales, even imposing death upon husbands violating the law, but a legal proscription was sometimes avoided or evaded, such as by arranging an adoption with a payment and an outcome similar to that of a sale. A society might tax or fine a wife sale without banning it. The nearness of a foreign military sometimes constrained a master in a slave sale that otherwise would have divided a family. Among criticisms, some of the sales (not of services alone but entirely of wives) have been likened to sales of horses. Wives for sale were treated like capital assets or commodities. One law made wives into husbands' chattels. Other sales were described as brutal, patriarchal, and feudalistic. Wife sales were equated with slavery. One debate about the whole of Africa was whether Africans viewed the practice as no crime at all or as against what Africans thought valuable and dear. Some modern popular songs against wife sale are vehicles for urban antipoverty and feminist organizing for rights. A story in a popular collection written by a feminist was about a suggestion for wife sale and the wife's objection to discussing it followed by no wife sale occurring. Another story is about a feminist advocate for justice in which a husband is censored or censured for selling his wife in a gamble.

Wife selling has been found in many societies over many centuries and occasionally into modern times,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thompson|1993|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the United States (including in Hawaii among the Japanese, among Indians in the Gallinomero, Yurok, Carolina, and Florida tribes and in the Pacific Northwest, and among natives on Kodiak Island in what is now Alaska), Colombia, England, Australia (among aborigines), Denmark (possibly), Hungary, France, Germany, India, Japan, Malaya (among Chinese laborers), Thailand (at least permitted), Northern Asia (among the Samoyads), Asia Minor (among the Yourouk), Kafiristan, Indonesia (albeit not outright), Tanganyika, Congo, Bamum, Central Africa (among the Baluba), Zambia, South Africa (among Chinese laborers), Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Nigeria (possibly), Abyssinia, Egypt, Lombardy, ancient Rome (sometimes as a legal fiction and sometimes as actual), ancient Greece, and ancient Emar (of Syria). In Rwanda, it was the subject of a wartime accusation. Specific bans existed in Thailand, Indonesia, ancient Rome, and ancient Israel and partial bans existed in England and Japan. Wife sale was a topic of popular culture in India, the U.S., China, Scandinavia, Nepal, Guatemala, and the Dutch Indies. It has been found under several major religions, including Christianity and Islam.

== History and practice ==

=== England ===
{{Main article|Wife selling (English custom)}}
The English custom of wife selling largely began in the late 17th century when divorce was a practical impossibility for all but the very wealthy. In the ritualized form, after parading his wife with a [[halter]] around her neck, arm, or waist, a husband would publicly [[auction]] her to the highest bidder. Although the custom had no basis in law and frequently resulted in prosecution, particularly from the mid-19th century onwards, the attitude of the authorities was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating that he did not believe he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local [[English Poor Law|Poor Law Commissioners]] forcing husbands to sell their wives, rather than having to maintain the family in [[workhouse]]s. The English custom of wife selling spread to Wales, Scotland, Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Valenze|2006|loc=p. 249 and probably n. 83 (n. omitted)}}, n. 83 citing {{harvp|Ihde|1998|pp=26–27}} and {{harvp|Hughes|1986|pp=244–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States before dying out in the early 20th century.

In 1781, in [[South Carolina]], a "Bill of Sale"&lt;ref name="WhtBondageAnteBellumSCar-SCHistGeneaMag-p191"&gt;{{harvp|Morris|1948|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a "Wife and Property"&lt;ref name="WhtBondageAnteBellumSCar-SCHistGeneaMag-p191" /&gt; for "Two Dollars and half Dozen Bowls of Grogg",&lt;ref name="WhtBondageAnteBellumSCar-SCHistGeneaMag-p191" /&gt; the buyer "to have my said Wife for ever and a Day",&lt;ref name="WhtBondageAnteBellumSCar-SCHistGeneaMag-p191" /&gt; is, according to Richard B.

The Carolina tribe of Native Americans,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|MacLeod|1925|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to William Christie MacLeod, as reported in 1925, engaged in [[debt bondage|debtor slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|MacLeod|1925|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''slave'' is defined by the Carolinas as "that which is obsequiously to depend on the master for subsistence".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|MacLeod|1925|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;375 n.&amp;nbsp;15}}, quoting Lawson, J., ''History of Carolina'' (1714), p.&amp;nbsp;327.&lt;/ref&gt; According to MacLeod quoting J. Lawson, "if a man takes a widow&amp;nbsp;... laden with her husband's debts, she seems to have some of the attributes of a chattel, although also a wife. Her husband may&amp;nbsp;....

According to [[George Elliott Howard]], as published in 1904, "if dissatisfied with his wife, the young Gallinomero of [California]&amp;nbsp;... may 'strike a bargain with another man' and sell her 'for a few strings of shell-money.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Howard|1904|loc=vol.

In the late 17th–mid 18th centuries, among some [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Indian tribes of the Pacific Northwest]], according to Elsie Frances Dennis, two Indians of unspecified tribe or tribes had been killed and "the widow and two daughters of one were wailing, for they were to be sold as slaves."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dennis|1930|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;188 and n.&amp;nbsp;43 (n. omitted)}}, citing, at n., White, ''Ten Years in Oregon'', p.&amp;nbsp;277.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all tribes of the region and time sold wives; according to Dennis, "Ross said that he never knew a single instance in which a Chinook or one of the neighboring tribes ever sold his wife".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dennis|1930|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;185 and n.&amp;nbsp;32 (n. omitted)}}, citing, at n., Ross, ''Adventures of the First Settlers'', p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802–1803, among native people on [[Kodiak Island|Kodiak (Kad'iak) Island]], in present-day Alaska and that was then part of [[Russia]], according to Gavriil Ivanovich Davydov,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pierce|1976|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;1, col.&amp;nbsp;1 and see col.&amp;nbsp;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "marital fidelity is not always considered a virtue by the islanders ["Koniagas"], and in many cases a husband will sell his wife for a small present."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pierce|1976|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;19, col.&amp;nbsp;2 (in [§] XIII, ''Marriage Customs'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Florida]], apparently ''c.'' in the 16th century, according to an unnamed "eye-witness",&lt;ref name="harvp|Cline|1962|p=105"&gt;{{harvp|Cline|1962|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; among [[Seminole|Florida Indians]],{{Efn|That the people described are Florida Indians is not explicitly by the "eye-witness" but is by Cline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Cline|1962|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;104 and n.&amp;nbsp;22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} "the ruler has power to give or rather to sell wives to those desirous of marriage."&lt;ref name="harvp|Cline|1962|p=105"/&gt;{{Efn|If the quoted description is inexact and the sale is not of wives but of wives-to-be, this may describe bride-buying.}}

According to W. R.

Not all people of African descent in the New York City area in 1776–1783 were slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Van Buskirk|1998|pp=75, 76, 78, and ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, records may not reveal their status.{{Efn|They are not revealed in all cases according to Van Buskirk.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Van Buskirk|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A "group of black men&amp;nbsp;...

Cases were reported from different states. A slave born in [[North Carolina]] who moved 50 miles recalled that, while she was between 5 and 8 years old, {{"'}}{{Nowrap|[w]hile}} here, he [unspecified who] sold my mother to New Orleans, leaving my father at home.'&amp;nbsp;....

==== Hawaii, among Japanese immigrants ====
Japanese immigration to Hawaii was promoted during the late 19th century, but their number included a low proportion of women.&lt;ref name=hori&gt;{{harvp|Hori||pp=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation of Japanese immigrants to the islands ([[Issei]]) lived at a distance from their original communities. According to Eileen Tamura, this isolation, combined with failure of the expectation of earning enough to return, resulted in a temporary disintegration of social norms, and the disintegration led to wife-selling.&lt;ref name=tamura&gt;{{harvp|Tamura|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SkYhzCp0UyAC&amp;pg=PA13 13]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheriff of the island of Hawaii, E. G. Hitchcock, wrote in 1892 that "I wish to call your attention to the fact, more or less prevalent on this island, of the Japanese selling their wives or mistresses to each other."&lt;ref name=hori/&gt; In 1901 and 1904, the sheriff of [[Maui]] wrote that "In connection with Japanese the custom they have of trafficing {{sic}} in their women, buying and selling their wives is an evil that should be looked into," and proposed that laws explicitly prohibiting wife-selling be enacted.&lt;ref name=hori/&gt; In a personal narrative related by Joan Hori, the question "Why would anyone want a second-hand wife?" was posed; the response was that the prospect of a wife already present in the islands was more certain than that of a [[picture bride]].&lt;ref name=hori/&gt;

=== China ===
The Chinese custom of wife selling&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Menefee|1981|loc=p. 1 and n. 2}}, citing Wood, E. J., ''The Marriage Day in all Ages and Countries'' (London: Richard Bentley, 1869), vol. 1, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; or 'selling a divorce' ({{zh|c=以财买休}}) has a long history, spanning both the Imperial and Modern eras.

==== Historic ====
According to 14th-century scholar Wei Su quoted by Paul J. Smith, "early in the dynasty,&amp;nbsp;... the system for assessing taxes and labor services was based&amp;nbsp;... on household size. As a result&amp;nbsp;... the poor got even poorer. Poor folk sold their wives and children to meet their payments to the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smith|1998|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest documented ban of the practice appears in [[Yuan Dynasty]] law dating to the 14th century. At that time, two types of wife selling were recognized, both considered illegal. The first type was when a husband sold his wife to a man with whom she had been committing [[adultery]]. The second type was when a husband sold his wife because she had betrayed him or because they were no longer able to get along. During the [[Ming Dynasty]], it was gradually established that only wife selling motivated by adultery should be punished. By 1568, wife selling was explicitly authorized by the law in several circumstances. Authorized wife selling was preserved by [[Qing Dynasty]] lawmakers, as was the prohibition against selling a wife to her lover.&lt;ref name=Sommer&gt;{{harvp|Sommer|2002|pp=57–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famines are related to wife sale. In 1834, about [[Jiangxi|Kiang-si]] province, the missionary Mathieu-Ly said of "starvation&amp;nbsp;.... [that] {{Nowrap|[a]ll}} crops have been swept away by the inundation of the rivers.... [Some] people&amp;nbsp;... eat&amp;nbsp;.... [expensive] earth&amp;nbsp;.... The people first sold their wives, then sons and daughters, then their utensils and furniture; finally they demolished their houses in order to dispose of the timber."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Laufer|1930|p=122}}, quoting the missionary&lt;/ref&gt; A 19th-century source characterized the practice as conventional among the lower classes in China: "The poorer people take their wives for an agreed term, and buy and sell them at pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wood|1869|loc=vol. [I], pp. [71]–72}}; briefly discussed in {{harvp|Menefee|1981|loc=p. 1 and n. 2}}, citing at n. 2 {{harvp|Wood|1869|loc=vol. 1, p. 174}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Howard, as published in 1904, "by Chinese law&amp;nbsp;... when the wife is guilty of adultery&amp;nbsp;.... [if] the woman not be slain,&amp;nbsp;... the husband may&amp;nbsp;... sell her as a concubine, provided he has not pandered to the crime or does not sell her to the guilty man."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Howard|1904|loc=vol. I, pp.&amp;nbsp;235–236 and n.&amp;nbsp;1 (n. omitted)}}, citing, at n., Paul Georg von Möllendorff (1985) ''Das chinesische Familienrecht'', p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to Howard, as published in 1904, in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Howard|1904|loc=vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;235}}&lt;/ref&gt; "a marriage may be dissolved by mutual agreement"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Howard|1904|loc=vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;236}}&lt;/ref&gt; "but the agreement&amp;nbsp;... must be in good faith. Should the wife plan the divorce so as to form a punishable relation with another man, it is void, and the husband may&amp;nbsp;... sell her to another as in the case of unfaithfulness".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Howard|1904|loc=vol. I, p.&amp;nbsp;236 n.&amp;nbsp;2}}, citing Kohler, ''Aus dem chin. Civilrecht'', ''ZVR.'', vol. VI, p.&amp;nbsp;376.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928–1930, in [[Shaanxi|Shensi]], there was a famine and, according to a local newspaper and Leonard T. K. Wu, peasants who "had already mortgaged and sold all their lands on which they formerly made a living"&lt;ref name="RuralBankruptChina-FarEastnSurvey-p213"&gt;{{harvp|Wu|1936|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;213, col.&amp;nbsp;1}}, citing ''Ta Kung Pao'' (Tientsin, also known as [[Tianjin]]) (Chinese daily).&lt;/ref&gt; then sold their wives.&lt;ref name="RuralBankruptChina-FarEastnSurvey-p213" /&gt;

==== Contemporary ====
As the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] came to power in 1949,&lt;ref name="ChinasStolenWives-USNWR"&gt;{{harvp|Fang|Leong|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; wife selling was prohibited and the government took measures to eradicate the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hessler|2001|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the famines caused by the [[Great Leap Forward]], wife selling occurred in many of the poorer areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Friedman|Pickowicz|Selden|Johnson|1993|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1997, the custom was still occasionally reported in some rural areas of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zweig|1997|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
In [[Edo period|Tokugawa Japan]] (1600–1868), according to [[J. Mark Ramseyer]] and Takeyoshi Kawashima, "men routinely sold their wives and children or rented them long-term&amp;nbsp;.... [and this] was endemic to the brutality of Asiatic patriarchal feudalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ramseyer|1995|p=128}}, citing Kawashima, Takeyoshi, ''Nihon shakai no kazokuteki kosei'' (''The Family Structure of Japanese Society'') (Tokyo: Nihon hyoron sha, 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; Ramseyer continued, "sales and adoptions were transfers in perpetuity",&lt;ref name="MktChild-JLEO-p132"&gt;{{harvp|Ramseyer|1995|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; the difference being that sales were sometimes legally banned&lt;ref name="MktChild-JLEO-p131-n8-p132"&gt;{{harvp|Ramseyer|1995|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;131 and n.&amp;nbsp;8 and p.&amp;nbsp;132}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that adoptions were likely used as an alternative to like effect, with payment in a like direction.&lt;ref name="MktChild-JLEO-p132" /&gt; Sales were essentially into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ramseyer|1995|p=132}} ([§] 3.1, 3d sentence).&lt;/ref&gt; Published sales and adoptions known to Ramseyer totalled 52 contracts in 1601–1860,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ramseyer|1995|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;129–130 and table 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 52 35 being of females and 17 being of males,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ramseyer|1995|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;133, table 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; transfers including children, depending on each contract. After 1740, sale "contracts&amp;nbsp;... largely disappeared",&lt;ref name="MktChild-JLEO-p132" /&gt; largely because of a growing demand for nonagricultural labor,&lt;ref name="MktChild-JLEO-p132" /&gt; making absconding&lt;ref name="MktChild-JLEO-p128"&gt;{{harvp|Ramseyer|1995|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; or running away&lt;ref name="MktChild-JLEO-p132" /&gt; easier and more profitable.&lt;ref name="MktChild-JLEO-p128" /&gt;

=== India ===
In 16th–17th-century [[Mughal Empire|Mughal India]], according to [[Irfan Habib]], although imperial regulations limited state revenue demands to approximately that which would permit the peasantry to survive,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Habib|1963|pp=319–320}}&lt;/ref&gt; the local collectors often lacked willingness to comply,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Habib|1963|pp=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; "violated or evaded" the regulations,&lt;ref name="AgrarianSysMughalIndia63-p322"&gt;{{harvp|Habib|1963|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; and overestimated peasants' ability to pay.&lt;ref name="AgrarianSysMughalIndia63-p322" /&gt; Despite at least one order that {{Nowrap|"prohibit[ed]}}&amp;nbsp;... the seizure and sale of the women and children of the combatants",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Habib|1963|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;323 and n.&amp;nbsp;25 (n. omitted)}}, citing, at n., Faẓl, Abū-l, ''Akbarnāma'' (Calcutta, probably Bib.

Also, in [[Bengal]], in approximately the same time period, according to Habib, "if any peasant or stranger died without leaving a son [or "died without heirs"]&amp;nbsp;... his wife and daughters were seized [as a "source of revenue"] for the benefit, depending upon the locality, of the&amp;nbsp;...

As reported in 1897 by [[William Lee-Warner]], "husbands sold their wives from motives of enmity as well as gain. The selling price of girls and women was at all times from four to ten times greater than that of males."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lee-Warner|1897|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;167, col.&amp;nbsp;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western [[Punjab region|Punjab]], in or before 1911, according to [[Aubrey J. O'Brien|A. J.

=== Africa ===
In Africa generally, according to Parker Shipton in 1990, "husbands sometimes sell wives [during famines or food shortages], but not vice versa".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shipton|1990|p=372}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, responding to a charge by [[David Hume]] that Africans "think it no crime to sell one another",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Henry|2004|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; African philosopher [[Ottobah Cugoano]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Henry|2004|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote, "nothing could be more opposite to everything that they hold dear and valuable".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Henry|2004|p=142}}, quoting either Cugoano, Ottobah, ''Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic and Commerce of the Human Species'' (1787), p.&amp;nbsp;27, or Cugoano, Ottobah, ''Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil of Slavery'' (New York: Penguin Books, 1999), p.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of West Africa#Niger Delta and Igbo|West Africa]], under the [[Aro Confederacy]], according to [[David Graeber]], "a man who simply disliked his wife and was in need of brass rods could always come up with some reason to sell her, and the village elders—who received a share of the profits—would almost invariably concur."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Graeber|2011|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;152–153 and see p.&amp;nbsp;153 n.&amp;nbsp;69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]], in the Masai district, in 1955, according to Robert F. Gray, the [[Sonjo people|Sonjo]] transfer "wives—that is to say, wife rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gray|1960|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;36 ("Sonjo material&amp;nbsp;... was obtained in the field in the last half of 1955", per p.&amp;nbsp;36 n.&amp;nbsp;3)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Sonjo, wrote Gray, "a lively system of economic exchange&amp;nbsp;.... also encompasses the sale and purchase of rights in women, who in their economic aspects are dealt with much like other commodities."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gray|1960|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gray, "when a husband dies, his wife rights are inherited by his eldest surviving brother. In this respect wives are dealt with in a different manner from other forms of property&amp;nbsp;.... A brother may take the widow as his wife&amp;nbsp;.... A brother may also sell the wife rights in the widow to another man, but in order to understand this transaction we must consider a mystical aspect of Sonjo marriage. It is believed that when a married person dies he will ultimately be reunited with his spouse in the spirit world. This belief is expressed in a myth: In former times the dead sometimes returned to earth to help their relatives here, but the last spirit to so materialize on earth was insulted and vowed that thereafter the dead would remain forever in the spirit world; she explained before departing that the spirits of dead husband and wives waited in the spirit world for their spouses to die, and were then reunited with them there. This belief has a practical bearing on bride-price transactions. Thus when a husband dies, the brother who inherits the widow may sell his rights in her to another man for the fixed price of thirty goats. This relatively small sum of less than half the woman's normal bride-price is explained by the belief in spirit marriage, for the new husband only acquires full wife rights in the woman in this world; after she dies she will rejoin her original husband in the spirit world. A second husband loses possession of her ghost. [¶] This reduced bride-price for a widow cannot be explained as resulting from a deterioration in her value as a wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gray|1960|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of divorce, stated Gray, a "husband exchanges his wife rights with another man for a sum of goats. It is convenient to say that he 'sells' his wife, because the form of the transaction is basically the same as those in which he exchanges or sells other goods. Thus a young wife is treated economically as a commodity. Later in life she outgrows this status, partly because her sexual attractions wane, but of more importance is the fact that her children grow up and are betrothed&amp;nbsp;.... This stabilizes her position in the community".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gray|1960|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray continued, a "young woman's value as a wife is not generally thought to be depreciated just because she was previously married, and a husband in selling a wife attempts to regain the same bride-price that he paid for her, which was originally based mainly on the social status of her parental family&amp;nbsp;... [with the price subject to] supply and demand&amp;nbsp;.... [Some] restrictions limit the probability of finding a buyer in the same village&amp;nbsp;.... After a buyer has been found, the wife is always given a grace period for finding a more desirable second husband before she is required to marry the man found by her husband. No physical coercion on the part of the husband is involved in the sale of a wife. The compulsive factor resides in the social structure, in which there is no regular position except as a wife for a young woman who was once married. However, a Sonjo husband has a special power, sanctioned by the community, over a wife whom he wishes to sell: if no acceptable buyer can be found within the tribe, he can sell her to the Masai, whose demands for Sonjo women and children seem to provide an unfailing market."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gray|1960|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Maasai people|Masai people]], an ethnic group in parts of Africa}} Gray wrote, "if a woman&amp;nbsp;.... behaves so as to make herself unsatisfactory as a wife she may induce her husband to sell her to another man of her choice, and thus has some means of protecting her own interest. This system of wife purchase is quite flexible in operation and seems to allow a woman as much freedom of choice—admittedly little—as is found in most other African societies."&lt;ref name="SonjoBridePriceQuestionAfricanWifePurchase-p43"&gt;{{harvp|Gray|1960|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gray, "children&amp;nbsp;... stay with their mother&amp;nbsp;... when she is sold and are adopted by her new husband."&lt;ref name="SonjoBridePriceQuestionAfricanWifePurchase-p43" /&gt; Gray wrote, "only young wives, childless or with young children, are normally considered saleable, and the price paid usually equals or is near the original bride-price, though that is never exceeded. In at least one case an older woman ["of about forty"] was sold by her husband for a considerably reduced price."&lt;ref name="SonjoBridePriceQuestionAfricanWifePurchase-p43" /&gt; Gray continued, "in these divorces&amp;nbsp;... payment is made&amp;nbsp;... only to her original husband [not to her father]. The village council, however, levies a tax of seven goats on these transactions&amp;nbsp;.... This fee or tax is no doubt indicative of some underlying disapproval of the selling of wives. Most of these goats, like those collected in fines, are sacrificed&amp;nbsp;.... When wives are exchanged rather than sold, the tax is only four goats&amp;nbsp;..., which accords with the general opinion that exchanging wives is preferable to selling them."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gray|1960|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In East Congo, among the Baguha, as reported in 1926 by Melville J. Herskovitz, if a [[bride price|bride-price]] is given at marriage and, for a reason, returnable but "is not returned, the man may sell his wife to recover the amount he gave for her, a custom distinctly not East African".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Herskovitz|1926|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;643 and n.&amp;nbsp;445 (n. omitted)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|an overview of divorce in Islam, including without payment|Divorce in Islam}}
In [[Islamic]] sources, while the term "wife selling" referring to someone giving his wife to someone else for money does not appear, "selling" word appears in the following sources in different meanings regarding the divorce issue.  By the [[Hanafi]] school of thought, according to [[Laleh Bakhtiar]] (1938–present), a husband may say to his wife, for example, "I sell you to yourself for so much",&lt;ref name="EncycIslamLaw-p517"&gt;{{harvp|Bakhtiar|1996|p=517}} ("comparative study of the ''Shariah'' or Islamic Divine Law" comparing the Hanafi, Hanbali, Shafii, Maliki, and Jafari schools of thought and based on "''Hadith''" and "''Sunnah''", all per p. xxix (''Preface'')).&lt;/ref&gt; and she may reply, "I purchase".&lt;ref name="EncycIslamLaw-p517" /&gt; According to Howard, as published in 1904, "under the existing law of Islam the woman has gained a limited right of divorce.... {{Nowrap|[S]he}} may buy her release; and in this case 'a restoration of the marriage bond is impossible.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="HistMatriInstns-v1p233-n3"&gt;{{harvp|Howard|1904|loc=vol.

Familie'', p.&amp;nbsp;409.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Harald Motzki]] in 2003, of 4 forms of divorce permitted by the [[Quran|Qurʾān]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Motzki|2003|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;279, col.&amp;nbsp;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; one is divorce by the wife "bargaining for it"&lt;ref name="MarriageDivorce-v3p280col1"&gt;{{harvp|Motzki|2003|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;280, col.&amp;nbsp;1}}&lt;/ref&gt; from her husband.&lt;ref name="MarriageDivorce-v3p280col1" /&gt; No source found reports that Islam requires that a wife must be sold or that this form of divorce is required. Other forms of divorce exist. No source found reports that the payment in this form of divorce must be spent for any specific post-divorce purpose, such as [[child support]] or [[alimony]], or that it need be a property settlement beyond the terms of the agreement.

As reported by Bakhtiar, comparing 5 branches of Muslim teaching, all 5 branches agree that a wife may pay "consideration"&lt;ref name="EncycIslamLaw-p511"&gt;{{harvp|Bakhtiar|1996|p=511}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, by 4 of the 5 schools, a third party may pay "ransom"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bakhtiar|1996|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;512, n.&amp;nbsp;11}} (the word "ransom" is from Bakhtiar, not quoting the Quran), citing, at n.&amp;nbsp;11, "''Al-Mughni'', vol. 7" (more fully, "Ibn Qudamah, ''al-Mughnbi''", per {{harvp|Bakhtiar|1996|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;5 n.&amp;nbsp;1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to her husband for a divorce,&lt;ref name="EncycIslamLaw-p511" /&gt; the branches differing under some circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bakhtiar|1996|pp=512, 515–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as on validity if the wife is pregnant.&lt;ref name="EncycIslamLaw-p516"&gt;{{harvp|Bakhtiar|1996|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divorce, according to Bakhtiar, of the form where "the wife pays her husband the consideration to divorce her"&lt;ref name="EncycIslamLaw-p511" /&gt; and when there is "mutual agreement to this kind of divorce"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bakhtiar|1996|p=511}} (other conditions may also apply).&lt;/ref&gt; is, by 4 of the 5 schools, while "valid",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bakhtiar|1996|p=512}}&lt;/ref&gt; "not recommended".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bakhtiar|1996|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;512, n.&amp;nbsp;10 (n. omitted)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bakhtiar, a 'divorce for a consideration' is called a ''khul''&lt;ref name="EncycIslamLaw-p517" /&gt; (according to Howard, {{Nowrap|"buy[ing]}} her release"&lt;ref name="HistMatriInstns-v1p233-n3" /&gt; is "by the form called ''chol''")&lt;ref name="HistMatriInstns-v1p233-n3" /&gt; and, by 4 out of 5 schools of thought, a variety of wordings, both explicit and implicit, may be used to pronounce such a divorce,&lt;ref name="EncycIslamLaw-p517" /&gt; such as ''al-khul'',&lt;ref name="EncycIslamLaw-p517" /&gt; the Jafaris also accepting ''al-talaq'',&lt;ref name="EncycIslamLaw-p518"&gt;{{harvp|Bakhtiar|1996|p=518}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hanafi and Shafii schools accepting ''al-bay'', meaning 'to sell',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bakhtiar|1996|pp=517 (Hanafi), 518 (Shafii)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hanafis accepting ''al-shira'', meaning 'to purchase'.&lt;ref name="EncycIslamLaw-p517" /&gt;

In the [[Christian Church]],&lt;ref name="ChristianSlaveMidAge-AmHistRvw-p676-passim"&gt;{{harvp|Pijper|1909|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;676 and ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to Frederik Pijper in 1909, "one way [to "become a slave"] was by selling oneself because of poverty. It might so happen that a married pair sank into such need that the husband was compelled to sell himself, and did so with his wife's consent. In this way he secured sustenance for himself, and with the purchase-money he was in a position to keep his wife from starving. Sometimes the conditions were reversed, and the wife sold herself with the same intentions and with her husband's consent. In such cases the marriage was usually dissolved; to be sure the Church opposed this, but could not prevent and therefore yielded to it.... A synod at Paris early in the seventh century ordained that freemen who had sold&amp;nbsp;... themselves should if they repaid the money at once be restored to their former status. To demand back a greater sum than what had been paid for them, was not allowed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pijper|1909|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;679, nn.&amp;nbsp;20–21 (nn. omitted)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting women by rank or class and noting which wives were sold and which were not, Pijper wrote of the medieval Church, a "woman of noble rank who had deserted her husband three times was to be put under penance, and was to be prohibited from marrying again; but if she was a woman from the people she must be sold without hope of regaining her freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pijper|1909|p=690}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Penance]], a repenting of sins (violations of God's will) or a religious sacrament for the repenting}}

In ancient Rome, in two situations, a "fictitious" sale was an actual procedure.

The buying the freedom of a slave being from another party's perspective the selling the slave into freedom, the medieval Christian Church permitted the selling into freedom of a slave who was a spouse; according to Pijper, "if&amp;nbsp;... two slaves were joined in wedlock by their common master, and one of them was thereafter freed, that one was permitted to marry again, if the freedom of the other could not be bought."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pijper|1909|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;695, n.&amp;nbsp;157 (n. omitted)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Rome, according to [[Jörg Rüpke]], "a husband selling his wife"&lt;ref name="ShallNotKillNormsRome-p67"&gt;{{harvp|Rüpke|1992|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;67, n.&amp;nbsp;50 and see p.&amp;nbsp;61 n.&amp;nbsp;7}}, citing "Plut. ''Rom.'' 22".&lt;/ref&gt; was a "crime&amp;nbsp;... that [would have] {{Nowrap|affect[ed]}} fundamental social relationships,"&lt;ref name="ShallNotKillNormsRome-p67" /&gt; in which the wife as "the harmed one is in an inferior position".&lt;ref name="ShallNotKillNormsRome-p67" /&gt; Thus, according to Rüpke, "by the ''sacer-esto''-formula, a curse declaring someone outlawed[,].... the delinquent"&lt;ref name="ShallNotKillNormsRome-p67" /&gt; may be killed by anyone.&lt;ref name="ShallNotKillNormsRome-p67" /&gt; Specifically, according to Rüpke, "if somebody has sold his wife, he shall be sacrificed to the lower gods".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rüpke|1992|p=61}}, citing "Plut. ''Rom.'' 22.4".&lt;/ref&gt; The enactment of "the law that whoever sold his wife should be given over to the infernal gods"&lt;ref name="Couch_46"&gt;{{harvp|Couch|1894|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To similar effect and attributing enactment to Romulus: {{harvp|Pound|1916|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;180 n.&amp;nbsp;7}}&lt;/ref&gt; was, according to John Andrew Couch in 1894, credited to Romulus.&lt;ref name="Couch_46"/&gt; According to [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]] in 1972, "anyone who sold his wife was to be dedicated [apparently 'sacrificed'] to the gods of the underworld."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Watson|1972|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;102, n.&amp;nbsp;25 (n. omitted)}} (''dedicated'' in sense of 'sacrificed' per pp.&amp;nbsp;100, 102, 103), citing, at n.&amp;nbsp;25, Plutarch, ''Romulus''.&lt;/ref&gt; "The husband who sold his wife was to be sacrificed (if we may so translate Plutarch&amp;nbsp;...) to the infernal deities", according to Fowler in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, W. Warde, ''The Original Meaning of the Word Sacer'', p.&amp;nbsp;60, n.&amp;nbsp;4 (n. omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To similar effect ("Plutarch tells us that a law of Romulus ordained that he who sold his wife should be sacrificed"): {{harvp|Bennett|1930|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;6, n.&amp;nbsp;10 (n. omitted)}} ("one would expect the killing of the offender to be represented as the sacrifice of a victim to the god" in same paragraph).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rüpke, this judgment and punishment reflected and was legitimized by religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rüpke|1992|pp=66–67, [58] (''Summary'')}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a while, the offense was no longer punished; according to Mary Emily Case, "this very primitive kind of justice [in which "one who violated these rules ["of the ''fas'',—that is, of religious duty"] was pronounced accursed, and might be killed by any who met him"] soon fell into disuse, and offences which were merely ''nefas''—such, for example, as selling a wife—ceased to be punished. Thus, ''fas'' early lost the force of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Case|1893|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Israel ===
In [[history of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel]], according to Levine, a man "could never sell a wife, even if she had originally been a war captive";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levine|2001|pp=89–90}}, citing "Dt. 21:14" (trans. perhaps by Levine).&lt;/ref&gt; at least he could not sell her to an "outsider",&lt;ref name="BiblWomenMarRt=p93"&gt;{{harvp|Levine|2001|p=93}}, citing "v.8" (trans. perhaps by Levine).&lt;/ref&gt; although redemption was possible.&lt;ref name="BiblWomenMarRt=p93" /&gt;

However, ambivalently, N. P. Lemche argued that "either there are no rules for a Hebrew's selling his wife&amp;nbsp;..., or&amp;nbsp;... [this category is] incorporated in the law&amp;nbsp;... in the way that it was considered impossible that a man should be able to sell his wife and remain free himself".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lemche|1975|p=143}}, citing as "the law" that of "vv2-6".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partial bans ===
Bans, whether against wife sales specifically or against all sales of human beings, that were only in effect part of the time or that were substantially violated and unenforced are too numerous to list. Examples include bans in England, often violated and generally unenforced for a time,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mansell|Meteyard|2004|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan, by law having no ban for a time.&lt;ref name="MktChild-JLEO-p131-n8-p132" /&gt;

In the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch Indies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sears|2010|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; fiction by [[Tirto Adhi Soerjo]], who was [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and writing in a language that "was a form of resistance to Dutch",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sears|2010|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to Laurie J. Sears, included in 1909 ''Membeli Bini Orang: Sebuah Cerita Yang Sungguh Sudah Terjadi Di Periangan'' (''Buying Another Man's Wife: A Story that Really Happened in the Priangan''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sears|2010|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;105 n.&amp;nbsp;33}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which "a religious Muslim&amp;nbsp;... tries to get rid of his wife, whom a ''dukun'' said was not good for him&amp;nbsp;.... [noting that since his marriage after his prior widowhood] all his business efforts have turned into failures&amp;nbsp;.... [and] he agrees to give or sell his wife to a greedy Eurasian (=Indo)&lt;!-- "Eurasian (=Indo)" so in original. --&gt; moneylender who has fallen in love with her.... [She, as the first man's wife,] is a very promiscuous woman, easily impressed with money and fashionable clothing, and the Eurasian ends up feeling more than punished for his pursuit and purchase of another man's wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sears|2010|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|A [[dukun]]&lt;!-- Plural form unknown. --&gt;, a shaman, one who interacts with the spirit world}}

In [[Scandinavia]],&lt;ref name="Mulder_31"&gt;{{harvp|Mulder|1956|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''c.'' 1850s–1870s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mulder|1956|loc=''passim'' and esp. pp.&amp;nbsp;30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; where there were many critics of the [[Mormonism|Mormon]] religion, "ballad mongers hawked 'the latest new verse about the Copenhagen apprentice masons' who sold their wives to the Mormons for two thousand kroner and riotously drowned their sorrows in the taverns".&lt;ref name="Mulder_31"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
A wife being subject to sale was a consequence of her being a man's property, according to sociologist Alvin John Schmidt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schmidt|1989|loc=p. 124 and see pp. 124–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious [[Ten Commandments|Commandment]] against coveting one's neighbor's wife has as part of its basis that "the wife is definitely seen as property", wrote Schmidt.&lt;ref name="VeilSilence-p126"&gt;{{harvp|Schmidt|1989|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians and earlier [[Hebrews]] were, according to Schmidt, influenced by the belief that "woman [was]&amp;nbsp;... unequal to man",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schmidt|1989|pp=128–129 (quoting p. 129)}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing "sexist theology".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schmidt|1989|p=129}} (''sexism'' defined by author as "an attitude, belief, or practice that subordinates an individual or group on the basis of sex", per p. xvii (''Introduction'')).&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt argued that teachers of [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition who teach on this Commandment "without drawing attention to the property concept of woman"&lt;ref name="VeilSilence-p126" /&gt; "might [be]&amp;nbsp;... unknowingly contributing to sexual inequality".&lt;ref name="VeilSilence-p126" /&gt; Inequality and inferiority are, according to Schmidt, "negative".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schmidt|1989|pp=xiv–xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wife selling was criticized by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Pope Gregory VII]] in the 11th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schmidt|1989|loc=p. 128, n. 34}}, citing von Hefele, Carl Joseph, ''Conciliengeschichte'', vol. 5 (Freiburg: Herder'sche Verlagshandlung, 1886), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Menefee|1981|p=211}}, citing Anderson, A. O., ''Early Sources of Scottish History'' (Edinburgh, 1922), vol. 2, p. 74, n.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Catholic church over time objected to it, apparently because it objected to divorce,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Menefee|1981|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the non-Catholic [[Christian Church|Christian church]] sometimes did not oppose it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schmidt|1989|loc=p. 128, nn. 35–36}}, citing {{harvp|Menefee|1981|pp=56, 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Menefee|1981|loc=p. 56, n. 20}}, citing ''Jackson's Oxford Journal'' (Oxford, Oxfordshire), February 1, 1800, p. 4, and July 15, 1809, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Menefee|1981|pp=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], writing in 1881, "to sell wives&amp;nbsp;... is slavery. This is what Jehovah 'authorized in Judea.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ingersoll|1881|p=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Burawoy|1984|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that machinery adds so many women and children to the workforce that men are displaced and thus, according to [[Michael Burawoy]], "all that the father can do is sell his wife and children."&lt;ref name="MarxSatanicMillBurawoy-p256n5"&gt;{{harvp|Burawoy|1984|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;256 n.&amp;nbsp;5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, according to Marx, "he has become a slave dealer."&lt;ref name="MarxSatanicMillBurawoy-p256n5" /&gt;

'''William Neal Reynolds''' (March 22, 1863 – September 10, 1951) was a [[United States|U.S.]] sportsman and businessman with [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]], which was founded by his brother [[R. J. Reynolds]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Patrick County, Virginia]], Reynolds went to work for his brother in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] in 1881 as he worked himself through Trinity College (later [[Duke University]]).&lt;ref name="nc biography"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Dictionary of North Carolina Biography |first=William S. |last=Powell}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1890 to 1940, Reynolds served as a director of Reynolds Co.&lt;ref name="nc biography"/&gt; He served as the first vice-president of the company until he took over the presidency in 1918.&lt;ref name="nc biography"/&gt;

==Chief executive of R.J. Reynolds==
Always called "Mr. Will,"&lt;ref name="barbarians"&gt;{{cite book

|year=2003|pages=40
|title=Barbarians at the Gate |first=Bryan |last=Burrough}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds took over the presidency of the company after his brother's death from [[cancer]] in 1918; he turned the presidency over in 1924 to [[Bowman Gray Sr.]]&lt;ref name="nc architecture"&gt;{{cite book

|title=North Carolina Architecture |first=Catherine |last=Bishir}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company then turned from "the dominance of its founder into the less personal sphere of corporate life."&lt;ref name="nc architecture"/&gt; Reynolds became the first chairman of the board of directors of Reynolds Co. in 1924 until 1931 and then served as chairman of the board's executive committee until 1941.&lt;ref name="nc biography"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Reynolds married Kate G. Bitting in 1889.&lt;ref name="nc biography"/&gt;

Reynolds was the first president of the Forsyth Country Club and commissioned a nine-hole [[golf course]] to be built.&lt;ref name="reynolds golf"&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=''Triad Golf''
|date=September 1998|pages=
|title=Reynolds and Golf: Longtime Companions |first=Mark |last=Cartner}}&lt;/ref&gt; After eight years, in 1921, he brought in famed golf course designer [[Donald Ross (golfer)|Donald Ross]] to design an 18-hole course.&lt;ref name="reynolds golf"/&gt; In 1925, Reynolds founded another golf course, Roaring Gap, about an hour away from Winston-Salem and also designed by Ross.&lt;ref name="reynolds golf"/&gt;

R.J. Reynolds' widow Katharine died in 1924, and their four children were then raised by William Reynolds and his wife, Kate.&lt;ref name="winston-salem"&gt;{{cite book
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQTmb8DBvIMC
|publisher=''John F. Blair, publisher''
|year=1994|pages=183, 194
|title=Winston-Salem: A History |first=Frank |last=Tursi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds and Kate had no children of their own.&lt;ref name="winston-salem"/&gt;

The youngest Reynolds child, [[Zachary Smith Reynolds]], called "Smith," was seven when his mother died.&lt;ref name="winston-salem"/&gt; He was [[murder]]ed at the age of 20 at his parents' estate, [[Reynolda House]]. His pregnant wife, [[Libby Holman]], and friend were indicted for the murder, in a sensational case that garnered national attention.&lt;ref name="winston-salem"/&gt; Reynolds contacted the district attorney and asked for the charges against his nephew's alleged killers to be dropped; the prosecutor eventually did so for lack of evidence, and no trial on the matter was ever held.&lt;ref name="winston-salem"/&gt; The [[Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation]] was established in Smith Reynolds' name by Smith Reynolds' siblings and by Reynolds. The foundation lured [[Wake Forest University]] away from its location {{convert|100|mi|km}} away in [[Wake Forest, North Carolina]] to establish a new campus on the grounds of Reynolda House and receive an annual endowment from the foundation.&lt;ref name="nc biography"/&gt;

Reynolds also built a [[hospital]] in Winston-Salem specifically for [[African-American]]s, named the Kate Bitting Reynolds Memorial Hospital in honor of his wife.&lt;ref name="nc biography"/&gt; In honor of his mother, he founded the Cox School in [[Stokes County, North Carolina]] and the Hardin Reynolds School in Patrick County, Virginia to honor his father. The Kate B. Reynolds Trust uses one-fourth of the income collected each year from its more than two million shares of R.J. Reynolds Co. stock to help the "poor and needy" in Winston-Salem.&lt;ref name="barbarians"/&gt;

==Tanglewood==
Reynolds built a {{convert|1117|acre|km2|adj=on}} country estate on the [[Yadkin River]] near Winston-Salem, [[Tanglewood Park Arboretum and Rose Garden]], and moved into it in 1921.&lt;ref name="winston-salem"/&gt; Reynolds kept [[racehorse]]s at Tanglewood for competition.&lt;ref name="nc biography"/&gt; In the racing season of 1909 to 1910, one of Reynolds' horses won 15 of 17 races conducted.&lt;ref name="nc biography"/&gt; He also owned interests in horse farms in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] and [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="nc biography"/&gt;

He eventually donated Tanglewood to [[Forsyth County, North Carolina|Forsyth County]] for use as a park.&lt;ref name="barbarians"/&gt; Today, Tanglewood has three golf courses; an 18-hole par 3 course, the Reynolds Course, and the Championship Course which hosted the 1974 PGA Championship and was the site of a Champions Tour event from 1987-2002. Tanglewood also has horseback riding, bicycling, swimming and boating.&lt;ref name="bowman gray"&gt;{{cite news
