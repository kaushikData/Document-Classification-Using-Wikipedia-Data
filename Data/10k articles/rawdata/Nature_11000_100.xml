'''Arthur Josef Stanislaus Berson''' (6 August 1859 &amp;ndash; 3 December 1942) was a [[Germans|German]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/3876507/berson-artur.html Encyklopedia PWN - Berson Artur]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather: Abs-Ero|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=av7q4N8Ib6sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=encyclopedia+of+climate&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V4TgUdLYB8WROKbFgZAC&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=berson&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 July 2013 |year=2011 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-976532-4 |page=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[meteorologist]] and pioneer of [[aerology]] who was a native of Neu Sandez, [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (now [[Nowy Sącz]], [[Poland]]).

After visiting the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Neu Sandez, Berson studied [[philology]] in [[University of Vienna|Vienna]]. He then studied [[meteorology]] and [[geography]] in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], where he had as instructors [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] and [[Wilhelm von Bezold]]. In 1890 he was an assistant to meteorologist [[Richard Assmann|Richard Aßmann]] at the Meteorological Institute in Berlin. During this period of time he was also secretary of the ''Deutschen Verein zur Förderung der Luftschiffahrt'', the first [[aeronautics|aeronautical]] organization in Germany. In 1900 he became ''Hauptobservator'' at the newly founded Aeronautics Observatory in Berlin-[[Tegel]], and was later stationed at the Lindenberg Aeronautical Observatory in [[Beeskow]]. From 1896 to 1899 Berson was editor of the magazine ''Zeitschrift für Luftfahrt und Physik der Atmosphäre'' (Magazine for Aviation and Physics of the Atmosphere).

== Scientific research ==
Berson is largely known for his scientific hot-air balloon expeditions. On 4 December 1894, he ascended to a then-record altitude of 9,155 meters aboard the hydrogen balloon ''Phoenix''. On 10 January 1901, with artillery officer Alfred Hildebrandt (1870–1949), he travelled from Berlin to [[Markaryd]], [[Sweden]] in a balloon, thus being the first to cross the [[Baltic Sea]] by air. On 10 January 1902, with balloonist Hermann Elias (1876–1955), he set the German long-distance ballooning record, as the two men journeyed from Berlin to [[Poltava]] in the central [[Ukraine]] (1,470 kilometers in 30 hours).

During the 1890s, he was involved in international "simultaneous ascents" with balloonists from other nations. These ascents were performed in order to study variances of [[climate|climatic]] conditions above different locations in Europe, to work to bring about uniformity in methods of observation, and to create increased cooperation among nations in the new science of [[aerology]].
[[File:Assmann Berson.jpg|right|thumb|With Richard Aßmann; Berson at the right]] 
On 31 July 1901, with meteorologist [[Reinhard Süring]], he took his most celebrated ascent. Starting from Berlin-[[Tempelhof]] aboard the ''Preussen'', Berson and Süring ultimately reached a height of 10,800 meters above [[sea level]]. At 6000 m. they required compressed oxygen, at 10,000 m. both scientists were rendered unconscious, and after regaining consciousness were able to land their balloon near [[Briesen, Oder-Spree|Briesen]], 7.5 hours after their flight began. Their record ascent had significant scientific importance. Climatic data taken from simultaneously released unmanned [[Atmospheric sounding|sounding]] balloons agreed with the information gathered from the Berson/Süring ascent. Now scientists such as Richard Aßmann no longer had any reason to distrust temperature readings taken from unmanned balloons, an important factor that led to the discovery of the [[stratosphere]] by Aßmann and [[Teisserenc de Bort]] in 1902.

Another important aspect of high-altitude flight involved [[physiology|physiological]] problems that balloonists could experience when exposed to conditions at great heights. Here, Berson assisted physiologists [[Hermann von Schrötter]] and [[Nathan Zuntz]] with pioneer experiments in the field of [[aviation medicine]]. He undertook high-altitude balloon ascents with the two physiologists, and conducted studies of [[decompression sickness]] with a [[decompression chamber|pneumatic chamber]] located at the ''Jüdischen Krankenhaus'' (Jewish Hospital) in Berlin.

Other significant accomplishments by Berson include climatic studies with weather kites off of [[Svalbard]], pioneer meteorological observations from [[German East Africa]], and aerological research over the [[Amazon Basin]].

The "'''Bergen School of Meteorology'''" is a school of thought which is the basis for much of modern [[weather forecasting]].

Founded by the meteorologist [[Vilhelm Bjerknes|Prof. Vilhelm Bjerknes]] and his younger colleagues in 1917, the Bergen School attempts to define the motion of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] by means of the [[mathematics]] of interactions between [[hydrodynamics|hydro-]] and [[thermodynamics]], some of which had originally been discovered or explained by Bjerknes himself, thus making mathematical predictions regarding the [[weather]] possible by systematic data analysis. Much of the work was done at the [[Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen|Geophysical Institute]], [[University of Bergen]], in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3301">[[File:Vesijako.jpg|thumb|right|Lake [[Vesijako]] in [[Padasjoki]], [[Finland]]]]
A '''bifurcation lake''' is a [[lake]] that has outflows into two different [[drainage basin]]s and thus the [[drainage divide]] cannot be defined exactly because it is situated in the middle of the lake.

==Examples==
[[Vesijako]] (the name ''Vesijako'' actually means "drainage divide") and [[Lummene]] in the [[Finnish Lakeland]] are two nearby lakes in [[Finland]]. Both drain in two directions: into the [[Kymijoki]] basin that drains into the [[Gulf of Finland]] and into the [[Kokemäenjoki]] basin that drains into the [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. 

Similarly the lakes [[Isojärvi (Satakunta)|Isojärvi]] and [[Inhottu]] in the [[Karvianjoki]] basin in the [[Satakunta]] region of western Finland both have two outlets: from Inhottu the waters flow into the Gulf of Bothnia through the Eteläjoki River in [[Pori]] and into lake Isojärvi through the Pomarkunjoki River. From lake Isojärvi the waters flow to the Gulf of Bothnia through the Pohjajoki river in Pori and through the Merikarvianjoki river in [[Merikarvia]]. In the Karvianjoki basin there have formerly been two other bifurcations, which no longer exist due to human action.

Another example is [[Bontecou Lake]], a shallow, man-made bifurcation lake in [[Dutchess County, New York]].&lt;ref name="watersheds"&gt;{{cite report|author=Dutchess County Environmental Management Council|title=Natural Resource Management Plan for the Wappinger Creek Watershed|publisher=Village of Wappingers GulfFalls|url=http://www.wappingersfallsny.gov/pdf/Natural%20Resource%20Planning.pdf|pages=1, 60|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lake Diefenbaker]] in [[Saskatchewan]] is a reservoir created by damming [[South Saskatchewan River]] and [[Qu'Appelle River]].  The lake continues to drain into the two rivers, but the Qu'Appelle receives a much enlarged flow (in essence, a diversion of flow from the South Saskatchewan) due to the damming. Both rivers eventually drain into [[Hudson Bay]] via [[Lake Winnipeg]] and the [[Nelson River]].{{cn|date=October 2018}} Also located in Saskatchewan is [[Wollaston Lake]], which is the source of [[Fond du Lac River (Mackenzie River)|Fond du Lac River]] draining into the [[Arctic Ocean]] and of [[Cochrane River (Canada)|Cochrane River]] draining into [[Hudson Bay]] and the Atlantic Ocean.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[Isa Lake]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] is a natural bifurcated lake which drains into two oceans.  Its western drainage is to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] (part of the Atlantic Ocean) via the [[Firehole River]], while its eastern drainage is to the [[Pacific Ocean]] via the [[Lewis River (Wyoming)|Lewis River]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Just after [[astronomical transit#Contacts|second contact]], and again just before [[astronomical transit#Contacts|third contact]] during the transit, a small black "teardrop" appears to connect [[Venus]]' disk to the [[wikt:limb#Etymology 2|limb]] of the [[Sun]], making it impossible to time the exact moment of second or third contact accurately.  This led to the failure of the attempts during the 18th century transits of Venus to establish a truly precise value for the [[astronomical unit]].

The black drop effect was long thought to be due to Venus' thick atmosphere, and indeed it was held to be the first real evidence that Venus had an atmosphere. However, it is now thought by many to be an optical effect caused by the combination of the extreme darkening of the sun's disk near its apparent edge and the intrinsic imperfection of the viewing apparatus.&lt;ref name="aas"&gt;

Observing Mercury simultaneously during its transit in May 1832 with different instruments, [[Friedrich Bessel|Bessel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander|Argelander]] noticed a black drop effect (without then using this term) with that instrument of less resolution.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Bessel: ''Durchgang des Mercurs durch die Sonne.'' In: ''Astronomische Nachrichten.'' Band&amp;nbsp;X (1832), No.&amp;nbsp;228, Sp.&amp;nbsp;185–196 ([http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1832AN.....10..185B digital]).&lt;/ref&gt; With precise measurements, a black drop effect was observed from outside the Earth's atmosphere during the 1999 and 2003 [[transit of Mercury|transits of Mercury]], although [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] has no significant atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;

In the 8 June 2004 transit of Venus, many observers reported that they did not see the black drop effect, or at least that it was much less pronounced than had been reported in earlier centuries' transits.&lt;ref name="Sky &amp;amp; Telescope"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/The-Disappearing-Black-Drop-153838145.html |title=The Disappearing Black Drop |last=Shiga |first=David |publisher=F+W Meida, Inc. |work=SkyandTelescope.com |date=24 May 2012 |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger telescopes, better optics, and [[limb darkening]] may have been factors.

The '''British  radio and Valve manufacturers Association''' ('''BVA''') was{{when|date=April 2017}} a [[cartel]] of [[vacuum tube|valve]] manufacturers in the [[United Kingdom]] of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) that was designed to protect their interests from foreign competition.  This cartel dictated (among other things), the price of valves (vacuum tubes) and how they were numbered (supposedly designed to make it difficult to identify American equivalents, which were typically half the price [retail] in the United States of America [USA]); however USA types manufactured in the UK by companies such as Brimar sold at the same price as their UK counterparts due to the BVA's insistence. All manufacturers eventually published their own lists of 'equivalents' between their own valves and those of other manufacturers including American types, so cross-referencing became easy, in the UK at least. 

The BVA dictated that no more than one electrode structure could be contained within one envelope.  This latter point was because the BVA levied a charge of initially £1 per valveholder, to cover royalties on any of its members' patent rights.  Pressure from set makers for multi-structure valves to overcome the BVA's edict led to British and European manufacturers introducing many multi-structure valves and these eventually became the norm. 

The British radio set makers were now able to adopt multi-structure valve designs. One German manufacturer produced a multi-structure valve that contained not only all the electrode structures for a complete radio receiver, but many of the passive components as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiomuseum-bocket.de/wp/en/loewe-3nf-tube Privates Loewe Opta Radiomuseum Bocket]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2422">The '''cerium anomaly''', in [[geochemistry]], is the phenomenon whereby [[cerium]] (Ce) concentration is either depleted or enriched in a rock relative to the other [[rare-earth elements]] (REEs).
A Ce anomaly is said to be "negative" if Ce is depleted relative to the other REEs and is said to be "positive" if Ce is enriched relative to the other REEs.

Cerium is a [[rare-earth element]] ([[lanthanide]]) characterized by two different redox states: III and IV. Contrary to other lanthanide elements, which are only trivalent (with the notable exception of [[Europium anomaly|Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]), Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; can be oxidized by atmospheric oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; under alkaline conditions.

The cerium anomaly relates to the decrease in solubility, which accompanies the oxidation of Ce(III) to Ce(IV). Under reducing conditions, Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is relatively soluble, while under oxidizing conditions CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precipitates. Sediments deposited under oxic or anoxic conditions can preserve on the long term the geochemical signature of Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; or Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; upon reserve that no early diagenetic transformation altered it.

Cerium can occur in nature as a 3+ or 4+ ion and is a compatible element (at 4+ valency) in zircon and less commonly in silica. Thomas ''et al.'', (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. B., Bodnar, R. J., Shimizu, N., Chesner, C. A. (2003) Melt inclusions in zircon. ''Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry'', '''53 (1)''', 63–87.&lt;/ref&gt; state that “terrestrial zircons commonly show a positive Ce anomaly due to the incorporation of Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; into zircon, which is because Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; has the same charge and a similar ionic radius than Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; (Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.97&amp;nbsp;Å; Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.84&amp;nbsp;Å)”. As such, Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; is incorporated into zircon much more easily than the larger Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (ionic radius = 1.143 Å). 

This shows that both Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; are present and that the Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; being compatible in zircon is causing the anomaly.

In [[meteorology]], a '''corona''' (plural ''coronae'') is an [[optical phenomenon]] produced by the [[diffraction]] of [[sunlight]] or [[moonlight]] (or, occasionally, bright [[starlight]] or [[planetlight]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/fz855.htm |title=Jupiter corona from Iran |last=Cowley |first=Les |year=2012 |publisher=Atmospheric Optics |accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; by individual small water [[drop (liquid)|droplets]] and sometimes tiny [[ice crystals]] of a [[cloud]] or on a foggy glass surface. In its full form, a corona consists of several [[concentric objects|concentric]], [[pastel (color)|pastel-colored]] rings around the [[astronomical object|celestial object]] and a central bright area called ''aureole''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Calvert |first=J. B. |url=https://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/astro/corona.htm |title=The Corona |publisher=[[University of Denver]] |date=2 August 2003 |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cowley |first=Les |url=http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/corona.htm |title=Corona |publisher=Atmospheric Optics |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aureole is often (especially in case of the [[Moon]]) the only visible part of the corona and has the appearance of a bluish-white disk which fades to reddish-brown towards the edge. The [[angular diameter]] of a corona depends on the [[particle size|sizes]] of the water droplets involved; smaller droplets produce larger coronae. For the same reason, the corona is the most pronounced when the size of the droplets is most uniform. Coronae differ from [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]]s in that the latter are formed by [[refraction]] (rather than diffraction) from comparatively large rather than small ice crystals.

==Pollen coronae==
[[Pollen]] suspended in the air can also cause diffraction of sunlight that produces coronae. Because pollen grains are not always spherical, the resulting pollen coronae often have characteristic elliptic shape and brighter spots in them. They can be seen during blooming season where there is significant source of pollen like forests. They are more easily seen during sunset or sunrise as there is less sun glare and the light path through pollen laden atmosphere is longer.

'''Electrification''' is the process of powering by [[electricity]] and, in many contexts, the introduction of such power by changing over from an earlier power source. The broad meaning of the term, such as in the [[history of technology]], [[economic history]], and [[economic development]], usually applies to a region or national economy.  Broadly speaking, electrification was the build-out of the [[electricity generation]] and [[electric power distribution]] systems that occurred in Britain, the United States, and other now-[[developed country|developed]] countries from the mid-1880s until around 1950 and is still in progress in rural areas in some [[developing country|developing countries]]. This included the transition in manufacturing from [[line shaft]] and belt drive using [[steam engine]]s and [[hydropower|water power]] to [[electric motor]]s.&lt;ref name=Devine83&gt;{{Cite journal

The electrification of particular sectors of the economy is called by terms such as [[Mass production#Factory electrification|''factory electrification'']], ''household electrification'', ''[[rural electrification]]'' or ''[[Railway electrification system|railway electrification]]''.  It may also apply to changing industrial processes such as smelting, melting, separating or refining from coal or coke heating, or chemical processes to some type of electric process such as [[electric arc furnace]], [[electric induction]] or [[Joule heating|resistance]] heating, or [[electrolysis]] or electrolytic separating.

Electrification was called "the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th Century" by the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref name="Constable1999"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives

== History of electrification ==
{{See also|Electricity|Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering}}
The earliest commercial uses of electricity were [[electroplating]] and the [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]].

===Development of magnetos, dynamos and generators===
{{Main|Electric generator}}
[[File:Faraday disk generator.jpg|thumb|left|Faraday disk, the first electric generator. The horseshoe-shaped magnet ''(A)'' created a magnetic field through the disk ''(D)''. When the disk was turned, this induced an electric current radially outward from the center toward the rim.  The current flowed out through the sliding spring contact ''m'', through the external circuit, and back into the center of the disk through the axle.]]

In the years of 1831–1832, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered the operating principle of electromagnetic generators.  The principle, later called [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], is that an [[electromotive force]] is generated in an electrical conductor that is subjected to a varying [[magnetic flux]], as for example,  a wire moving through a magnetic field.  He also built the first electromagnetic generator, called the [[Faraday disk]], a type of [[homopolar generator]], using a [[copper]] disc rotating between the poles of a horseshoe [[magnet]].  It produced a small DC voltage.

Around 1832, [[Hippolyte Pixii]] improved the magneto by using a wire wound horseshoe, with the extra coils of conductor generating more current, but it was AC. [[André-Marie Ampère]] suggested a means of converting current from Pixii's magneto to DC using a rocking switch. Later segmented commutators were used to produce direct current.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] developed a telegraph around 1838-40. In 1840 Wheatstone was using a magneto that he developed to power the telegraph. Wheatstone and Cooke made an important improvement in electrical generation by using a battery-powered electromagnet in place of a permanent magnet, which they patented in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990|pp=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The self-excited magnetic field dynamo did away with the battery to power electromagnets. This type of dynamo was made by several people in 1866.

The first practical generator, the [[Gramme machine]] was made by Z.T Gramme, who sold many of these machines in the 1870s. British engineer [[R. E. B. Crompton]] improved the generator to allow better air cooling and made other mechanical improvements. Compound winding, which gave more stable voltage with load, improved operating characteristics of generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990|pp=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The improvements in electrical generation technology increased the efficiency and reliability greatly in the 19th century. The first magnetos only converted a few percent of mechanical energy to electricity. By the end of the 19th century the highest efficiencies were over 90%.

===Electric lighting===

====Arc lighting====
[[File:Yablochkov candles illuminating Avenue de l'Opera ca1878.jpg|thumb|Yablochkov's demonstration of his brilliant arc lights at the 1878 Paris Exposition along the [[Avenue de l'Opéra]] triggered a steep sell off of gas utility stocks.]]
{{Main|Carbon arc lamp}}
Sir [[Humphry Davy]] invented the [[carbon arc lamp]] in 1802 upon discovering that electricity could produce a light [[electric arc|arc]] with carbon electrodes. However, it was not used to any great extent until a practical means of generating electricity was developed.

Carbon arc lamps were started by making contact between two carbon electrodes, which were then separated to within a narrow gap. Because the carbon burned away, the gap had to be constantly readjusted. Several mechanisms were developed to regulate the arc. A common approach was to feed a carbon electrode by gravity and maintain the gap with a pair of electromagnets, one of which retracted the upper carbon after the arc was started and the second controlled a brake on the gravity feed.&lt;ref name=HB&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|Bryant|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arc lamps of the time had very intense light output – in the range of 4000 [[candlepower]] (candelas) – and released a lot of heat, and they were a fire hazard, all of which made them inappropriate for lighting homes.&lt;ref name="McNeil1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology |last=McNeil |first=Ian|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-14792-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1850s, many of these problems were solved by the arc lamp invented by [[William Petrie (electrical engineer)|William Petrie]] and William Staite. The lamp used a magneto-electric generator and had a self-regulating mechanism to control the gap between the two carbon rods. Their light was used to light up the [[National Gallery]] in London and was a great novelty at the time. These arc lamps and designs similar to it, powered by large magnetos, were first installed on English lighthouses in the mid 1850s, but the power limitations prevented these models from being a proper success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990|pp=360–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful [[Yablochkov candle|arc lamp]] was developed by Russian engineer [[Pavel Yablochkov]], and used the [[Gramme machine|Gramme generator]]. Its advantage lay in the fact that it didn't require the use of a mechanical regulator like its predecessors. It was first exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Exposition of 1878]] and was heavily promoted by Gramme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/measureforgreatn001419mbp/measureforgreatn001419mbp_djvu.txt|title=A Measure for Greatness: A Short Biography of Edward Weston|first=David Oakes | last = Woodbury|year=1949|publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=83|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[arc lamp|arc light]] was installed along the half mile length of [[Avenue de l'Opéra]], Place du Theatre Francais and around the [[Place de l'Opéra]] in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electricity at the Columbian Exposition|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lF5KAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3|page=1|first = John Patrick | last = Barrett|accessdate=2009-01-04|publisher=R. R. Donnelley &amp; sons company|year=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British engineer [[R. E. B. Crompton]] developed a more sophisticated design in 1878 which gave a much brighter and steadier light than the Yablochkov candle. In 1878, he formed Crompton &amp; Co. and began to manufacture, sell and install the Crompton lamp. His concern was one of the first electrical engineering firms in the world.

====Incandescent light bulbs====
Various forms of [[incandescent light bulbs]] had numerous inventors; however, the most successful early bulbs were those that used a carbon filament sealed in a high vacuum. These were invented by [[Joseph Swan]] in 1878 in Britain and by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1879 in the US. Edison’s lamp was more successful than Swan’s because Edison used a thinner filament, giving it higher resistance and thus conducting much less current. Edison began commercial production of carbon filament bulbs in 1880. Swan's light began commercial production in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990|pp=366–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swan's house, in [[Low Fell]], Gateshead, was the world's first to have working light bulbs installed. The Lit &amp; Phil Library in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], was the first public room lit by electric light,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Glover |first=Andrew |title=Alexander Armstrong in appeal to save Lit and Phil |quote=The society’s lecture theatre was the first public room to be lit by electric light, during a lecture by Sir Joseph Swan on October 20, 1880. |newspaper=The Journal |date=8 February 2011 |url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2011/02/08/alexander-armstrong-in-appeal-to-save-lit-and-phil-61634-28133303/ |accessdate=8 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215165559/http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2011/02/08/alexander-armstrong-in-appeal-to-save-lit-and-phil-61634-28133303/ |archivedate=15 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/content/image_galleries/lit_and_phil_gallery.shtml?12 History in pictures - The Lit &amp; Phil] BBC. Retrieved 8 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Savoy Theatre]] was the first public building in the world lit entirely by electricity.&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, pp. 7–11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central power stations and isolated systems===
The first central station providing public power is believed to be one at [[Godalming#Public electricity supply|Godalming]], Surrey, U.K. autumn 1881. The system was proposed after the town failed to reach an agreement on the rate charged by the gas company, so the town council decided to use electricity. The system lit up arc lamps on the main streets and incandescent lamps on a few side streets with hydroelectric power. By 1882 between 8 and 10 households were connected, with a total of 57 lights. The system was not a commercial success and the town reverted to gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990|pp=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first large scale central distribution supply plant was opened at [[Holborn Viaduct]] in London in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/how/electricity/electricity_07.asp |title=History of public supply in the UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201194910/http://www.engineering-timelines.com/how/electricity/electricity_07.asp |archivedate=2010-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Equipped with 1000 incandescent lightbulbs that replaced the older gas lighting, the station lit up Holborn Circus including the offices of the [[General Post Office]] and the famous [[City Temple (London)|City Temple church]]. The supply was a direct current at 110V; due to power loss in the copper wires, this amounted to 100V for the customer.

Within weeks, a parliamentary committee recommended passage of the landmark 1882 Electric Lighting Act, which allowed the licensing of persons, companies or local authorities to supply electricity for any public or private purposes.

The first large scale central power station in America was Edison's [[Pearl Street Station]] in New York, which began operating in September 1882. The station had six 200 horsepower Edison dynamos, each powered by a separate steam engine. It was located in a business and commercial district and supplied 110 volt direct current to 85 customers with 400 lamps. By 1884 Pearl Street was supplying 508 customers with 10,164 lamps.{{sfn|Hunter|Bryant|1991|p=191}}

By the mid-1880s, other electric companies were establishing central power stations and distributing electricity, including [[R. E. B. Crompton#Crompton &amp; Co.|Crompton &amp; Co.]] and the [[Edison and Swan Electric Light Company|Swan Electric Light Company]] in the UK, [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] in the US and [[Siemens]] in [[Germany]]. By 1890 there were 1000 central stations in operation.&lt;ref name="HB"/&gt; The 1902 census listed 3,620 central stations. By 1925 half of power was provided by central stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|Bryant|1991|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Load factor &amp; isolated systems====
One of the biggest problems facing the early power companies was the hourly variable demand. When lighting was practically the only use of electricity, demand was high during the first hours before the workday and the evening hours when demand peaked.&lt;ref name="Hunter &amp; Bryant 1991 276–9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter &amp; Bryant|1991|pp=276–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, most early electric companies did not provide daytime service, with two-thirds providing no daytime service in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|Bryant|1991|pp=212 Note 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio of the average load to the peak load of a central station is called the load factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter&amp;Bryant|1991|pp=276–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For electric companies to increase profitability and lower rates, it was necessary to increase the load factor. The way this was eventually accomplished was through motor load.&lt;ref name="Hunter &amp; Bryant 1991 276–9"/&gt; Motors are used more during daytime and many run continuously. (See: [[Continuous production]].)  Electric street railways were ideal for load balancing. Many electric railways generated their own power and also sold power and operated distribution systems.&lt;ref name="Nye 1990"/&gt;

The load factor adjusted upward by the turn of the 20th century—at [[Pearl Street Station|Pearl Street]] the load factor increased from 19.3% in 1884 to 29.4% in 1908. By 1929, the load factor around the world was greater than 50%, mainly due to motor load.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|Bryant|1991|pp=283–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before widespread power distribution from central stations, many factories, large hotels, apartment and office buildings had their own power generation. Often this was economically attractive because the exhaust steam could be used for building and industrial process heat,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter&amp;Bryant|1991|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which today is known as [[cogeneration]] or combined heat and power (CHP). Most self-generated power became uneconomical as power prices fell. As late as the early 20th century, isolated power systems greatly outnumbered central stations.&lt;ref name = "HB"/&gt; [[Cogeneration]] is still commonly practiced in many industries that use large amounts of both steam and power, such as pulp and paper, chemicals and refining. The continued use of private electric generators is called [[microgeneration]].

===Direct current electric motors===
{{Main|Electric motor|DC motor}}
The first commutator DC electric motor capable of turning machinery was invented by the British scientist [[William Sturgeon]] in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=William|others=|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|chapter=Sturgeon, William (1783–1850)|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/26748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crucial advance that this represented over the motor demonstrated by [[Michael Faraday]] was the incorporation of a [[commutator]]. This allowed Sturgeon's motor to be the first capable of providing continuous rotary motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarbotics.net/starting/200111_dcmotor/200111_dcmotor.html|title=DC Motors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank J. Sprague]] improved on the [[DC motor]] in 1884 by solving the problem of maintaining a constant speed with varying load and reducing sparking from the brushes. Sprague sold his motor through Edison Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nye|1990|pp=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is easy to vary speed with DC motors, which made them suited for a number of applications such as electric street railways, machine tools and certain other industrial applications where speed control was desirable.&lt;ref name = "HB"/&gt;

===Alternating current===
{{main|Alternating current}}
{{See also|Transformer|Electric power transmission|War of currents}}
Although the first power stations supplied [[direct current]], the distribution of [[alternating current]] soon became the most favored option. The main advantages of AC were that it could be transformed to high voltage to reduce transmission losses and that AC motors could easily run at constant speeds.

[[Alternating current]] technology was rooted in [[Michael Faraday]] 1830–31 discovery that a changing [[magnetic field]] can induce an [[electric current]] in a [[Electrical circuit|circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Volume 1|publisher=Springer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tUrarQYhKMC&amp;pg=PA2640&amp;dq=AC+power+system+and+William+Stanley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G-NzT4vCOcjDgQf7pNA5&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=AC%20power%20system%20and%20William%20Stanley&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to conceive of a rotating magnetic field was Walter Baily who gave a workable demonstration of his battery-operated [[Polyphase system|polyphase]] motor aided by a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] on June 28, 1879 to the Physical Society of London.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Wizard: the life and times of Nikola Tesla : biography of a genius|publisher=Citadel Press|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=xthzT5i3B4HctgfPrcyMBg&amp;id=h2DTNDFcC14C&amp;dq=Invention+of+AC+motor+Ferraris+and+Tesla&amp;q=Walter+Baily#v=snippet&amp;q=Walter%20Baily&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly identical to Baily’s apparatus, French electrical engineer [[Marcel Deprez]] in 1880 published a paper that identified the rotating magnetic field principle and that of a two-phase AC system of currents to produce it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Polyphase electric currents and alternate-current motors|publisher=Spon|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvwHAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=Marcel+Deprez+and+alternating+current&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7dpzT5KoI4jTtweSpcyNBg&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcel%20Deprez%20and%20alternating%20current&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1886, English engineer [[Elihu Thomson]] built an AC motor by expanding upon the induction-repulsion principle and his [[wattmeter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Innovation as a Social Process|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=258|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUB5KFjTHhwC&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=Elihu+Thomson+and+AC+motor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=le10T8eIOK-62gW6hZmlDQ&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Elihu%20Thomson%20and%20AC%20motor&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 1880s that the technology was commercially developed for large scale electricity generation and transmission. In 1882 the British inventor and [[electrical engineer]] [[Sebastian de Ferranti]], working for the company [[Siemens]] collaborated with the distinguished physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] to pioneer AC power technology including an early transformer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swehs.co.uk/tactive/_S29-1.html?zoom_highlight=museum|title=Nikola Tesla The Electrical Genius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Transformer|power transformer]] developed by [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]]. They also exhibited the invention in [[Turin]] in 1884, where it was adopted for an electric lighting system. Many of their designs were adapted to the particular laws governing electrical distribution in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

[[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]] went into this business in 1882 when he set up a shop in London designing various electrical devices. Ferranti believed in the success of alternating current power distribution early on, and was one of the few experts in this system in the UK. With the help of [[Lord Kelvin]], Ferranti pioneered the first AC power generator and [[transformer]] in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edisontechcenter.org/AC-PowerHistory.html|title=AC Power History and Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hopkinson]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physicist]], invented the three-wire ([[three-phase]]) system for the distribution of electrical power, for which he was granted a [[patent]] in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]: ''Hopkinson, John'' by T. H. Beare&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian inventor [[Galileo Ferraris]] invented a polyphase AC [[induction motor]] in 1885. The idea was that two out-of-phase, but synchronized, currents might be used to produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a rotating field without any need for switching or for moving parts. Other inventors were the American engineers Charles S. Bradley and [[Nikola Tesla]], and the German technician [[Friedrich August Haselwander]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g07Q9M4agp4C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Polyphase+current+was+discovered&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I1XGUMWgJMHC0QGJ64HIDg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Polyphase%20current%20was%20discovered&amp;f=false|title=Networks of Power|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were able to overcome the problem of starting up the AC motor by using a rotating magnetic field produced by a poly-phase current.&lt;ref name="Hunter &amp; Bryant 1991 248"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter &amp; Bryant|1991|pp=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Heertje]], Mark Perlman [https://books.google.com/books?id=qQMOPjUgWHsC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=tesla+motors+sparked+induction+motor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d0d_SjX8YX&amp;sig=sA8LhTkGdQtgByBPD_ZDalCBwQA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XoVSUPnfJo7A9gSwiICYCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20motors%20sparked%20induction%20motor&amp;f=false]  Evolving Technology and Market Structure: Studies in Schumpeterian Economics, page 138&lt;/ref&gt; By 1895 GE and Westinghouse both had AC motors on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter &amp; Bryant|1991|pp=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; With single phase current either a capacitor or coil (creating inductance) can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a rotating magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990|pp=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Multi-speed AC motors that have separately wired poles have long been available, the most common being two speed. Speed of these motors is changed by switching sets of poles on or off, which was done with a special motor starter for larger motors, or a simple multiple speed switch for fractional horsepower motors.

====AC power stations====
The first AC power station in the world was built by the English [[electrical engineer]] [[Sebastian de Ferranti]]. In 1887 the London Electric Supply Corporation hired Ferranti for the design of their power station at [[Deptford]]. He designed the building, the generating plant and the distribution system. It was built at the Stowage, a site to the west of the mouth of [[Deptford Creek]] once used by the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]]. Built on an unprecedented scale and pioneering the use of high voltage (10,000V) AC current, it generated 800 kilowatts and supplied central London. On its completion in 1891 it was the first truly modern power station, supplying high-voltage AC power that was then "stepped down" with transformers for consumer use on each street. This basic system remains in use today around the world.

In America, [[George Westinghouse]] who had become interested in the power transformer developed by Gaulard and Gibbs, began to develop his AC lighting system, using a transmission system with a 20:1 step up voltage with step-down. In 1890 Westinghouse and Stanley built a system to transmit power several miles to a mine in Colorado. A decision was taken to use AC for power transmission from the Niagara Power Project to Buffalo, New York. Proposals submitted by vendors in 1890 included DC and compressed air systems.  A combination DC and compressed air system remained under consideration until late in the schedule.  Despite the protestations of the Niagara commissioner [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin) the decision was taken to build an AC system, which had been proposed by both Westinghouse and General Electric. In October 1893 Westinghouse was awarded the contract to provide the first three 5,000&amp;nbsp;hp, 250 rpm, 25&amp;nbsp;Hz, two phase generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|Bryant|1991|pp=285–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1890s, single and poly-phase AC was undergoing rapid introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter &amp; Bryant|1991|pp=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. by 1902, 61% of generating capacity was AC, increasing to 95% in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter &amp; Bryant|1991|pp=253, Note 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the superiority of alternating current for most applications, a few existing DC systems continued to operate for several decades after AC became the standard for new systems.

===Steam turbines===
{{Main|Steam turbine}}
The efficiency of steam prime movers in converting the heat energy of fuel into mechanical work was a critical factor in the economic operation of steam central generating stations.  Early projects used reciprocating [[steam engine]]s, operating at relatively low speeds. The introduction of the [[steam turbine]] fundamentally changed the economics of central station operations. Steam turbines could be made in larger ratings than reciprocating engines, and generally had higher efficiency. The speed of steam turbines did not fluctuate cyclically during each revolution; making parallel operation of AC generators feasible, and improved the stability of rotary converters for production of direct current for traction and industrial uses.  Steam turbines ran at higher speed than reciprocating engines, not being limited by the allowable speed of a piston in a cylinder. This made them more compatible with AC generators with only two or four poles; no  gearbox or belted speed increaser was needed between the engine and the generator. It was costly and ultimately impossible to provide a belt-drive between a low-speed engine and a high-speed generator in the very large ratings required for central station service.

The modern [[steam turbine]] was invented in 1884 by the British [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]], whose first model was connected to a [[dynamo]] that generated 7.5&amp;nbsp;kW (10&amp;nbsp;hp) of electricity.&lt;ref name="birrcastle.com"&gt;[http://www.birrcastle.com/steamTurbineAndElectricity.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513211302/http://www.birrcastle.com/steamTurbineAndElectricity.asp |date=May 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of Parson's steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible. [[C. A. Parsons and Company|Parsons turbines]] were widely introduced in English central stations by 1894; the first electric supply company in the world to generate electricity using [[turbo generator]]s was Parsons' own electricity supply company [[Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company]], set up in 1894.&lt;ref name=siemens&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiki-north-east.co.uk/article.aspx?id=201525|title=A marriage took place last week that wedded two technologies possibly 120 years too late.|accessdate=2009-01-02|last=Forbes|first=Ross|date=17 April 1997|work=wiki-north-east.co.uk/|publisher=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]]}}{{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Parson's lifetime, the generating capacity of a unit was scaled up by about 10,000 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Steam Turbine|url=http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/parsons/part1.html|last=Parsons|first=Sir Charles A.|authorlink=Charles A.

[[File:PSM V56 D0717 Parsons steam turbine linked directly to a dynamo.png|thumb|An 1899 [[C. A. Parsons and Company|Parsons steam turbine]] linked directly to a dynamo]]

The first U.S. turbines were two De Leval units at Edison Co. in New York in 1895. The first U.S. Parsons turbine was at [[Westinghouse Air Brake Company|Westinghouse Air Brake Co.]] near [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter &amp; Bryant|1991|pp=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam turbines also had capital cost and operating advantages over reciprocating engines. The condensate from steam engines was contaminated with oil and could not be reused, while condensate from a turbine is clean and typically reused.  Steam turbines were a fraction of the size and weight of comparably rated reciprocating steam engine. Steam turbines can operate for years with almost no wear. Reciprocating steam engines required high maintenance.  Steam turbines can be manufactured with capacities far larger than any steam engines ever made, giving important [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]].

Steam turbines could be built to operate on higher pressure and temperature steam. A fundamental principle of [[thermodynamics]] is that the higher the temperature of the steam entering an engine, the higher the  efficiency. The introduction of steam turbines motivated a series of improvements in temperatures and pressures. The resulting increased conversion efficiency lowered electricity prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The power density of boilers was increased by using forced combustion air and by using compressed air to feed pulverized coal. Also, coal handling was mechanized and automated.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"&gt;{{Cite book

===Electrical grid===
{{Main|Electrical grid}}
With the realization of long distance power transmission it was possible to interconnect different central stations to balance loads and improve load factors. Interconnection became increasingly desirable as electrification grew rapidly in the early years of the 20th century.

[[Charles Merz]], of the [[Merz &amp; McLellan]] consulting partnership, built the [[Neptune Bank Power Station]] near [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in 1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/enquiries/energy/evidence/ShawA1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Kelvin to Weir, and on to GB SYS 2005|date=29 September 2005|first = Alan | last = Shaw |publisher=Royal Society of Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1912 had developed into the largest integrated power system in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nnouk.com/survey/survey-utilities.shtml |title=Survey of Belford 1995 |publisher=North Northumberland Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 he tried to influence Parliament to unify the variety of voltages and frequencies in the country's electricity supply industry, but it was not until [[World War I]] that Parliament began to take this idea seriously, appointing him head of a Parliamentary Committee to address the problem. In 1916 Merz pointed out that the UK could use its small size to its advantage, by creating a dense distribution grid to feed its industries efficiently. His findings led to the [[Archibald Williamson, 1st Baron Forres|Williamson Report]] of 1918, which in turn created the Electricity Supply Bill of 1919. The bill was the first step towards an integrated electricity system in the UK.

The more significant Electricity (Supply) Act of 1926, lead to the setting up of the National Grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-places_collections/w-collections-main/w-collections-highlights/w-collections-lighting-electricity.html |title=Lighting by electricity |publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|The National Trust]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629091025/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-places_collections/w-collections-main/w-collections-highlights/w-collections-lighting-electricity.html |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Central Electricity Board]] standardised the nation's [[electrical power|electricity supply]] and established the first synchronised AC grid, running at 132 [[volt|kilovolts]] and 50 [[Hertz]]. This started operating as a national system, the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]], in 1938.

In the United States it became a national objective after the power crisis during the summer of 1918 in the midst of World War I to consolidate supply. In 1934 the [[Public Utility Holding Company Act]] recognized electric utilities as [[public good]]s of importance along with gas, water, and telephone companies and thereby were given outlined restrictions and regulatory oversight of their operations.&lt;ref name="Electric Power Planning"&gt;Mazer, A. (2007). Electric Power Planning for Regulated and Deregulated Markets. John, Wiley, and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ. 313pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Household electrification ===
The electrification of households in Europe and North America began in the early 20th century in major cities and in areas served by electric railways and increased rapidly until about 1930 when 70% of households were electrified in the U.S.

Rural areas were electrified first in Europe, and in the US the [[Rural Electric Administration]], established in 1935 brought electrification to rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Stephen|last2=Simon|first2=Julian|author1-link=|title=The Greatest Century That Ever Was: 25 Miraculous Trends of the last 100 Years, The Cato Institute: Policy Analysis, No. 364|date=Dec 15, 1999|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa364.pdf|page=20 Fig. 16|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}Fig 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical cost of electricity===
Central station electric power generating provided power more efficiently and at lower cost than small generators. The capital and operating cost per unit of power were also cheaper with central stations.&lt;ref name=Devine83/&gt; The cost of electricity fell dramatically in the first decades of the twentieth century due to the introduction of [[steam turbines]] and the improved load factor after the introduction of AC motors. As electricity prices fell, usage increased dramatically and central stations were scaled up to enormous sizes, creating significant economies of scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transforming the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations and Their Consequences

==Benefits of electrification==

===Benefits of electric lighting===
Electric lighting was highly desirable. The light was much brighter than oil or gas lamps, and there was no soot. Although early electricity was very expensive compared to today, it was far cheaper and more convenient than oil or gas lighting. Electric lighting was so much safer than oil or gas that some companies were able to pay for the electricity with the insurance savings.&lt;ref name="Nye 1990"/&gt;

===Pre-electric power===
{{Main|Line shaft}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One of the inventions most important to a class of highly skilled workers (engineers) would be a small motive power - ranging perhaps from the force of from half a man to that of two horses, which might commence as well as cease its action at a moment's notice, require no expense of time for its management and be of modest cost both in original cost and in daily expense."

To be efficient steam engines needed to be several hundred horsepower.  Steam engines and boilers also required operators and maintenance.  For these reasons the smallest commercial steam engines were about 2 horsepower. This was above the need for many small shops.  Also, a small steam engine and boiler cost about $7,000 while an old blind horse that could develop 1/2 horsepower cost $20 or less.&lt;ref&gt;Unskilled labor made approximately $1.25 per 10- to 12-hour day. Hunter &amp; Bryant cite a letter from [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Benjamin Latrobe]] to [[John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)|John Stevens]] ca. 1814 giving the cost of two old blind horses used to power a mill at $20 and $14.  A good dray horse cost $165.&lt;/ref&gt;  Machinery to use horses for power cost $300 or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter &amp; Bryant|1991|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Batteuse 1881.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|
Threshing machine in 1881.]]

Many power requirements were less than that of a horse.  Shop machines, such as woodworking lathes, were often powered with a one- or two-man crank.  Household sewing machines were powered with a foot treadle; however, factory sewing machines were steam-powered from a [[line shaft]].  Dogs were sometimes used on machines such as a treadmill, which could be adapted to churn butter.&lt;ref name="Hunter &amp; Bryant 1991 pp"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter &amp; Bryant|1991|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century specially designed ''power buildings'' leased space to small shops.  These building supplied power to the tenants from a steam engine through [[line shaft]]s.&lt;ref name="Hunter &amp; Bryant 1991 pp"/&gt;

Electric motors were several times more efficient than small steam engines because central station generation was more efficient than small steam engines and because line shafts and belts had high friction losses.&lt;ref name=Devine83/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter &amp; Bryant 1991 pp"/&gt;

Electric motors were more efficient than human or animal power.  The conversion efficiency for animal feed to work is between 4 and 5% compared to over 30% for electricity generated using coal.&lt;ref name = "Ayers-Warr 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fraw.org.uk"/&gt;

===Economic impact of electrification===
{{Main|Mass production#history}}

Electrification and economic growth are highly correlated.&lt;ref name="Electricity_in_Economic Growth"/&gt; In economics, the efficiency of electrical generation has been shown to correlate with ''technological progress''.&lt;ref name = "Ayers-Warr 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ayres | last2 = Ayres| last3 =Warr| first1 = R.

In the U.S. from 1870-80 each man-hour was provided with .55&amp;nbsp;hp.  In 1950 each man-hour was provided with 5&amp;nbsp;hp, or a 2.8% annual increase, declining to 1.5% from 1930-50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Productivity in the United States: Trends and Cycles |last=Kendrick |first= John W.|authorlink= |year= 1980 |publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-8018-2289-6 |page=97| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The period of electrification of factories and households from 1900 to 1940, was one of high [[productivity]] and economic growth.

Most studies of electrification and electric grids focused on industrial core countries in Europe and the United States. Elsewhere, wired electricity was often carried on and through the circuits of colonial rule. Some historians and sociologists considered the interplay of colonial politics and the development of electric grids: in India, Rao &lt;ref&gt;Rao, Y. Srinivasa (2010) “Electricity, Politics and Regional Economic Imbalance in Madras
Presidency, 1900–1947.” Economic and Political Weekly 45(23), 59–66&lt;/ref&gt; showed that linguistics-based regional politics — not techno-geographical considerations — led to the creation of two separate grids; in colonial Zimbabwe (Rhodesia), Chikowero &lt;ref&gt;Chikowero, Moses (2007) “Subalternating Currents: Electrification and Power Politics
in Bulawayo, Colonial Zimbabwe, 1894–1939.” Journal of Southern African Studies
33(2), 287–306&lt;/ref&gt; showed that electrification was racially based and served the white settler community while excluding Africans; and in Mandate Palestine, Shamir &lt;ref&gt;Shamir, Ronen (2013) Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine. Stanford: Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} claimed that  British electric concessions to a Zionist-owned company deepened the economic disparities between Arabs and Jews.

==Power sources for generation of electricity==
{{Main|Electricity generation}}
Most electricity is generated by [[thermal power station]]s or steam plants, the majority of which are [[fossil fuel power station]]s that burn coal, natural gas, fuel oil or bio-fuels, such as wood waste and black liquor from chemical pulping.

The most efficient thermal system is [[combined cycle]] in which a [[combustion turbine]] powers a generator using the high temperature combustion gases and then exhausts the cooler combustion gases to generate low pressure steam for conventional steam cycle generation.

===Hydroelectricity===
{{main|Hydroelectricity}}

[[Hydroelectricity]] uses a [[water turbine]] to generate power.  In 1878 the world's first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at [[Cragside]] in [[Northumberland]], [[England]] by [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William George Armstrong]]. It was used to power a single [[arc lamp]] in his art gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Industrial archaeology review, Volumes 10-11|year=1987|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4xg9AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Industrial%20archaeology%20review%3A%20Volumes%2010-11&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions|author=Association for Industrial Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The old [[Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station#Origins|Schoelkopf Power Station No. 1]] near [[Niagara Falls]] in the U.S. side began to produce electricity in 1881. The first [[Thomas Alva Edison|Edison]] hydroelectric power plant, the [[Vulcan Street Plant]], began operating September 30, 1882, in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.clara.net/darvill/altenerg/hydro.htm|title= Hydroelectric power - energy from falling water|publisher=Clara.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energy.cfm?page=tl_hydropower Energy Timelines - Hydropower]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind turbines===
The first electricity-generating [[wind turbine]] was a battery charging machine installed in July 1887 by Scottish academic [[James Blyth (engineer)|James Blyth]] to light his holiday home in [[Marykirk]], Scotland.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/dnb/100957.html | title = James Blyth | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2009-10-09}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Some months later American inventor [[Charles F. Brush|Charles F Brush]] built the first automatically operated wind turbine for electricity production in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; 
Advances in recent decades greatly lowered the cost of wind power making it one of the most competitive alternate energies and competitive with higher priced natural gas (before shale gas). Wind energy's main problem is that it is intermittent and therefore needs grid extensions and energy storage to be a reliable main energy source.

===Geothermal energy===
Prince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first [[geothermal]] power generator on 4 July 1904 in [[Larderello]], Italy. It successfully lit four light bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, G. N.; Ghosal, M. K. ''Renewable Energy Resources: Basic Principles and Applications.'' Alpha Science Int'l Ltd., 2005 {{ISBN|1-84265-125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1911, the world's first commercial geothermal power plant was built there. Italy was the world's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until 1958.
Geothermal requires very hot underground temperatures near the surface to generate steam which is used in a low temperature steam plant. Geothermal power is only used in a few areas. Italy supplies all of the electrified rail network with geothermal power.

===Solar energy===
{{main|Solar energy|Photovoltaics}}

Electricity production from solar energy either directly through [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic cells]] or indirectly such as by producing steam to drive a [[steam turbine]] generator.

==Current extent of electrification==
[[File:World Access to Electricity 2012 cropped.png|thumb|upright=1.8|World map showing the percentage of the population in each country with access to [[mains electricity]], as of 2012.]]
While electrification of cities and homes has existed since the late 19th century even today about 1.3 billion people lack electricity, mostly in [[Africa]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. One estimate (2010) suggests that as many as half of [[India]]'s households lack electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianaid.org.uk/images/shifting-goal-posts.pdf |title=Final RE Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recent progress in electrification took place between the 1950s and 1980s. Vast gains were seen in the 1970s and 1980s - from 49 percent of the world's population in 1970 to 76 percent in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energydevelopment/|title=IEA - Energy Access|work=worldenergyoutlook.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/22196/From_Acai_to_Access_(Published_Version).pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610193847/http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/22196/From_Acai_to_Access_%28Published_Version%29.pdf |date=2015-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent gains have been more modest - by the early 2010s 81 to 83 percent of the world's population had access to electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/item/20130531145822-jlky7/?source=hpeditorial|title=Population growth erodes sustainable energy gains - UN report|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|work=trust.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy resilience==
{{Main|Energy resilience}}
Electricity is a "sticky" form of energy, in that it tends to stay in the continent or island where it is produced. It is also multi-sourced; if one source suffers a shortage, electricity can be produced from other sources, including [[renewable source]]s. As a result, in the long term it is a relatively resilient means of energy transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future |title=Our Electric Future — The American, A Magazine of Ideas |publisher=American.com |date=2009-06-15 |accessdate=2009-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825064622/http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future/ |archivedate=2014-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the short term, because electricity must be supplied at the same moment it is consumed, it is somewhat unstable, compared to fuels that can be delivered and stored on-site. However, that can be mitigated by [[grid energy storage]] and [[distributed generation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">The '''electro-kinetic road ramp''' is a method of generating electricity by harnessing the kinetic energy of automobles that drive over the ramp. In June 2009, one of the devices was installed  in the car park at a [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket in [[Gloucester, United Kingdom]], where it provides enough electricity to run all of the store's cash registers. The ramp was invented by Peter Hughes, an electrical and mechanical engineer who is employed by Highway Energy Systems Ltd. The company says that under normal traffic conditions, the apparatus will produce 30 kW of electricity. Other proposed applications for the road ramps include powering street and traffic lights, heating roads in the winter to prevent ice from forming, and ventilating tunnels to reduce pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenrightnow.com/kabc/2009/07/10/electro-kinetic-road-ramp-powers-up-by-pushing-down/ Electro-kinetic road ramp powers up by pushing down], Green Right Now, Noofangle Media, July 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was dismissed as ''Talk of 'kinetic energy plates' is a total waste of energy'' in the Guardian  by [[David MacKay (scientist)|David MacKay]], the professor of [[natural philosophy]] in the department of [[Physics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. MacKay wrote, "The savings from parking at the green car park thus amount to one four-thousandth of the energy used by the trip to the supermarket."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/jun/17/renewable-energy-kinetic-road Talk of 'kinetic energy plates' is a total waste of energy], The Guardian, June 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://withouthotair.blogspot.com/2009/06/one-percent-rule-leading-to-patriotic.html The one-percent rule], withouthotair.blogspot.com, by David MacKay, June 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3864">'''Energoland''' is an information centre for energy and electricity generation which was opened by [[Slovenské elektrárne]] on 14 October 2014 at [[Mochovce]], [[Slovakia]], at the site of the nuclear power plant. It is situated between Levice and Nitra. The centre mainly serves the schools and public. The entry is free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://energoland.seas.sk/reservations&lt;/ref&gt; The exposition was awarded as an excellent communication project at the PIME conference and evaluated as a five-star training centre by Laura Elizabeth Kennedy, governor of the United States of America in the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and chargé d'affaires of permanent representation of the USA in international organisation in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/iaea-governor-energoland-is-a-5-star-education-centre/156&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exposition ==
In Energoland, there are more than thirty objects, applications, and interactive expositions. Edutainment (blending education and entertainment) at Mochovce offers information on energy, electricity generation, global warming, and carbon burden. In addition, visitors learn about the energy mix, electricity grid dispatching, or about the radiation around us. The exposition also focuses on power industry, not only with respect to safety and radioactive waste but also dealing with the fuel cycle, nanowolrd of atoms, and Cherenkov radiation. Some of the specialities include the 3D cinema with its own movie Energy Odyssey, a model of emission-free motorcycle, interactive LED floor or thermal mirror, and mobile application using augmented reality, "Energoland",&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.sk.strategic.EnergolandAR&lt;/ref&gt; downloadable from Google Play or AppStore. Through the Energy Map, various facts and statistics can be searched which are directly shown in the map of the world with the highlighted countries.
Energoland also wants its visitors to make their own opinion of the electricity generation and its sources. Therefore, it does not provide information only about nuclear energy but it also brings knowledge about other sources: water, sun, wind, geothermal energy, or fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://energoland.seas.sk/exposition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/energoland-opened-by-slovenske-elektrarne/119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/gallery/energoland-new-dimension-of-entertainment&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of Energoland ==
The design of the building is the work of Ing. arch. Viktor Šabík (BARAK Architekti) who, together with the QEX Company and Italian agency Piter Design, designed the interior of Energoland, as well.[2] The total area of the building, including the training rooms and offices is 2,000 square metres; the info centre itself takes up the area of 600 m2.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/data/education/126/file/cfakepathe-atom-10-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Activities ==
Energoland is not only a visitor and information centre; it also serves as a training centre for the employees of Slovenské elektrárne and provides office areas. There are many events for the employees of Slovenské elektrárne or public taking place here, such as the 90 reactor-years anniversary,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/90-reaktorrokov-jadrovych-blokov-slovenskych-elektrarni/140&lt;/ref&gt; programme within the national round of Olympics in Physics,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/mladi-fyzici-na-olympiade-v-atomovej-elektrarni/162&lt;/ref&gt; Science Talks during the Science and Technology Week,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/slovenske-elektrarne-hlavnym-partnerom-tvt/130&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable Development Conference in May 2015, etc.

'''Energy brokers''' assist clients in procuring [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] from energy wholesalers/suppliers.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Since electricity and natural gas are commodities, prices change daily with the market.  It is challenging for most businesses without energy managers to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers since prices must be compared on exactly the same day.  In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted.  An energy broker can provide a valuable service if they work with a large number of suppliers and can actually compile the sundry prices from suppliers.  An important aspect of this consulting role is to assure that the client understands the differences between the contract offers.  Under some State Laws they use the term "Suppliers" to refer to energy suppliers, brokers, and [[Smart Grid aggregator|aggregator]]s, however there are very important differences between them all.

Energy brokers do not own or distribute energy, nor are allowed to sell energy directly to you.  They simply present the rates of a wholesaler, or supplier.

==Product and services==
Energy consultants offer a lot more than procuring energy contracts from a supplier. In the UK and Europe where there is a lot of legislation and increasing pressure for businesses and countries to do more to reduce their energy consumption a lot of services from brokers now help ensure businesses meet a lot of compliance and accreditation requirements such as the ESOS (energy saving opportunity scheme), [[ISO 50001]], [[ISO 14001]], [[Energy Performance Certificate]]s and [[Display Energy Certificate]]s.
Other services include helping companies reduce energy consumption with the aim of meeting national and international carbon emission standards. Services include, energy health checks, energy audits, carbon zero, carbon offsetting and energy saving consulting.

Additional services such as arranging a [[power purchase agreement]], energy export contracts can be procured as well as energy monitoring and reporting technology and solutions are also offered by [[energy consultants]].

==Who do energy brokers serve?==
In the USA, energy brokers can serve residential, commercial and government entities that reside in energy deregulated states. In the [[UK]], and some countries in [[Europe]], the entire market is deregulated.

==Fees==
Energy brokers typically do not charge up front fees to provide rates.  If an entity purchases energy through a broker, the broker's fee is usually included in the rate the customer pays.    Some brokers will charge a fixed fee for their consulting services.

==Consulting==
{{main|Energy consulting}}
Not all energy brokers are consultants; However, the energy brokers who are also consultants will perform a more detailed analysis of a consumers' usage pattern in order to provide a custom rate, which typically results in more cost savings for the consumer.  Typically, they do not need any more information than that of an energy broker, because they can pull usage information from the local utility company.  There are some national energy brokers that use auditing teams to verify their client's invoices.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ. do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps].

== Oil production ==
{{main|Oil reserves in the United Arab Emirates}}
In June 2010 UAE had 6th top global proved oil reserves about 100 billion barrels, behind [[Energy in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[Energy in Venezuela|Venezuela]], [[Energy in Iran|Iran]], [[Energy in Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Energy in Kuwait|Kuwait]]. The crude oil production of UAE was more than 4 and less than 5 million barrels daily.&lt;ref name="TI2011"/&gt;

UAE was 4th top crude oil net exporter (108 Mt in 2008) and 10th top crude oil producers (120 Mt in 2009).&lt;ref&gt;IEA Key statistics 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gas production==
UAE has 7th top global proved natural gas reserves, above 6 trillion cubic metres. The global gas production in 2009 was 3 trillion cubic meters.&lt;ref name="TI2011"/&gt;

==Solar==
{{main|Solar power in the United Arab Emirates}}
The UAE has massive solar generation potential, and its energy policy has shifted substantially due to the declining price of solar. The Dubai Clean Energy Strategy aims to provide 7 per cent of Dubai’s energy from clean energy sources by 2020. It will increase this target to 25 per cent by 2030 and 75 per cent by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/dubai-ruler-wants-solar-panels-on-every-roof-by-2030&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuclear ==
{{main|Nuclear power in the United Arab Emirates}}

Despite being a large oil exporter, the UAE is installing nuclear power plants to meet its energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/UAE_nuclear_power_inf123.html |title= Nuclear Power in the United Arab Emirates |date=January 2011 |work= Country Briefings |publisher= [[World Nuclear Association]] (WNA) |accessdate= 2011-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has signed an agreement with the U.S. on nuclear cooperation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uae-embassy.org/uae/energy/nuclear-energy |title=US-UAE 123 Agreement |accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/UAE_nuclear_power_inf123.html |title=UAE NPT Signatory |accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change ==
[[United Arab Emirates]] was 6th top [[carbon dioxide]] emitter per capita in the world in 2009: 40.31 tonnes per capita. Top countries were (tonnes/capita): [[Gibraltar]] 152, U.S. [[Virgin Islands]] 114, [[Qatar]] 80, [[Netherlands Antilles]] 51 and [[Bahrain]] 43.&lt;ref name=Guardianlist&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/31/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-country-data-co2 World carbon dioxide emissions data by country: China speeds ahead of the rest] Guardian 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; All emissions from building and cement production are local but some people may argue that some United Arab Emirates produced fuels and/or goods are consumed abroad.&lt;ref name=Guardian2010&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/21/countries-responsible-climate-change?intcmp=122 Which nations are most responsible for climate change?] Guardian 21 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The UAE has begun acting aggressively to reduce its carbon emissions.

In 2015, 251 million tubes of [[toothpaste]] were sold in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;FoodIndustryMagazine. (n.d.). Toothpaste unit sales in U.S. supermarkets in 2014 and 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A single tube holds roughly 170 grams of toothpaste, so approximately 43 kilotonnes of toothpaste get washed into the water systems annually.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Brar S, Verma M, Tyagi R, Surampalli R (2009). Engineered Nanoparticles in Wastewater and Wastewater Sludge - Evidence and Impacts. Waste Management, 30: 504-520.&lt;/ref&gt; Toothpaste contains [[silver nanoparticle|silver nanoparticle&lt;nowiki/&gt;s]], also known as nanosilver or AgNPs, among other compounds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Each tube of toothpaste contains approximately 91&amp;nbsp;mg of silver nanoparticles, with approximately 3.9 tonnes of silver nanoparticles entering the environment annually.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Silver nanoparticles are not entirely cleared from the water during the wastewater treatment process, possibly leading to detrimental environmental effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Silver nanoparticles in toothpaste ==
[[Silver nanoparticle]]s are used for catalyzing chemical reactions, Raman imaging, and antimicrobial sterilization.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Choi, O., Deng, K. K., Kim, N. J., Ross, L., Jr., Surampalli, R. Y., &amp; Hu, Z. (2008). The inhibitory effects of silver nanoparticles, silver ions, and silver chloride colloids on microbial growth. Water Res, 42(12), 3066-3074.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with its antimicrobial properties, its low mammalian cell toxicity makes these particles a common addition to consumer products.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Washing textiles embedded with silver nanoparticles results in the oxidation and transformation of metallic Ag into [[Silver chloride|AgCl]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Silver nanoparticles have different physicochemical characteristics from the free silver ion, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and possess increased optical, electromagnetic, and catalytic properties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Particles with one dimension of 100&amp;nbsp;nm or less can generate reactive oxygen species. Smaller particles less than 10&amp;nbsp;nm may pass through cellular membranes and accumulate within the cell.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Silver nanoparticles were also found to attach to cellular membranes, eventually dissipating the proton motive force, leading to cell death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Silver nanoparticles that are larger than the openings of membrane [[Ion channel|channel proteins]] can easily clog channels, leading to the disruption of membrane permeability and transport.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the antimicrobial effectiveness of silver nanoparticles has been shown to decrease when dissolved in liquid media.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The free silver ion are potentially toxic to bacteria and planktonic species in the water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The positively charged silver ion can also attach to the negatively charged cell walls of bacteria, leading to deactivation of cellular enzymes, disruption of membrane permeability, and eventually, cell lysis and death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, its toxicity to microorganisms is not overtly observed since the free silver ion is found in low concentrations in wastewater treatment systems and the natural environment due to its complexation with ligands such as [[chloride]], [[sulfide]], and [[thiosulfate]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Silver_Nanoparticle_Interactions_in_Wastewater_Treatment_Systems.png|thumb|400px|Some occurrences of interactions of AgNPs in wastewater treatment systems are depicted.]]

=== Wastewater treatment ===
A majority of silver nanoparticles in consumer products go down the drain and are eventually released into sewer systems and reach wastewater treatment plants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kaegi, R., Voegelin, A., Sinnet, B., Zuleeg, S., Hagendorfer, H., Burkhardt, M., &amp; Siegrist, H. (2011).		Behavior of metallic silver nanoparticles in a pilot wastewater treatment plant. Environmental

Science Technology, 45(9), 3902-3908. doi:10.1021/es1041892.&lt;/ref&gt; Primary screening and grit removal in [[wastewater treatment]] does not completely filter out [[silver nanoparticle]]s, and coagulation treatment may lead to further condensation into wastewater sludge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The secondary wastewater treatment process involves suspended growth systems which allow bacteria to decompose organic matter within the water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Any [[silver nanoparticle]]s still suspended in the water may collect on these microbes, potentially killing them due to their antimicrobial effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After passing through both treatment processes, the silver nanoparticles are eventually deposited into the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A majority of the submerged portions of wastewater treatment plants are anoxic and rich in sulfur.&lt;ref name=":19"/&gt; During the wastewater treatment process, silver nanoparticles either remain the same, are converted into free silver ions, complex with ligands, or agglomerate.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hou, L., Li, K., Ding, Y., Li, Y., Chen, J., Wu, X., &amp; Li, X. (2012). Removal of silver nanoparticles in simulated wastewater treatment processes and its impact on COD and NH4 reduction. Chemosphere, 87(3), 248-252. doi:&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.12.042&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver nanoparticles can also attach to wastewater [[biosolids]] found in both the sludge and the effluent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Silver ions in wastewater are removed efficiently because of their strong complexation with chloride or sulfide.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Brown, J. (2017). Impact of Silver Nanoparticles on Wastewater Treatment. Nanotechnologies for Environmental Remediation: Applications and Implications (pp. 255-267). Cham: Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A majority of the silver found in wastewater treatment plant [[Effluent sewer|effluent]] is associated with reduced sulfur as organic [[Thiol|thiol groups]] and inorganic sulfides.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Silver nanoparticles also tend to accumulate in [[activated sludge]], and the dominant form of the silver found in sewage sludge is [[Silver sulfide|Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Therefore, most of the silver found in wastewater treatment plants is in the form of silver nanoparticles or silver precipitates such as [[Silver sulfide|Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] and [[Silver chloride|AgCl]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The amount of silver precipitate formed depends on silver ion release, which increases with increasing [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] concentration and decreasing pH.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Hou, L., Li, K., Ding, Y., Li, Y., Chen, J., Wu, X., &amp; Li, X. (2012). Removal of silver nanoparticles in simulated wastewater treatment processes and its impact on COD and NH4 reduction. Chemosphere, 87(3), 248-252. doi:&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.12.042&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver ions account for approximately 1% of total silver after silver nanoparticles are suspended in aerated water.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In anoxic wastewater treatment environments, silver ion release is therefore often negligible, and most of the silver nanoparticles in wastewater remain in the original silver nanoparticle form.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The presence of natural organic matter can also decrease oxidative dissolution rates and therefore the release rate of free silver ions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The slow oxidation of silver nanoparticles may enable new pathways for its transfer into the environment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Transformation in the environment ===
The silver nanoparticles that pass through wastewater treatment plants undergo transformations in the environment through changes in [[Particle aggregation|aggregation]] state, [[Redox|oxidation]] state, [[precipitation]] of secondary phases, or [[sorption]] of organic species.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Laglera L, Tovar-Sanchez A (2012). Direct recognition and quantification by volammetry of thiol/thioamide mixes in seawater. Talanta, 89: 496-504.&lt;/ref&gt; These transformations can result in the formation of [[Colloid|colloidal solutions]]. Each of these new species potentially have toxic effects which have yet to be fully examined.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Most silver nanoparticles in products have an organic shell structure around a core of Ag&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This shell is often created with carboxylic acids functional groups, usually using citrate, leading to stabilization through adsorption or covalent attachment of organic compounds.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In seawater, [[glutathione]] reacts with [[Citric acid|citrate]]&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; to form a [[thioester]] via [[ester]]ification.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Sidenius U, Skonberg C, Olsen J, Hansen S (2003). In vitro reactivity of carboxylic acid-CoA thioesters with glutathione. Chemical Research in Toxicology, 17: 75-81.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Citrate_and_glutathione_reaction.png|thumb|Esterification reaction of citrate and glutathione]]

Thioesters exhibit electrosteric repulsive forces due to [[amine]] functional groups and their size, which prevents aggregation. These electrostatic repulsive forces are weakened by [[counterion]]s in solution, such as [[Ca²⁺|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] found in seawater. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are naturally found in seawater due to the weathering of [[Calcareous|calcareous rocks]], and allow for [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of the oxide-coated particle at low [[electrolyte]] concentrations.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Li X, Lenhart J, Walker H (2010). Dissolution-Accompanied Aggregation Kinetics of Silver Nanoparticles. Langmuir, 26 (22): 16690-16698.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This leads to the aggregation of silver nanoparticles onto thioesters in seawater.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; When aggregation occurs, the silver nanoparticles lose microbial toxicity, but have greater exposure in the environment for larger organisms.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; These effects have not been completely identified, but may be hazardous to an organism’s health via biological magnification.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Silver speciation in wastewater effluent, surface waters and pore waters. Environmental Toxicology Chemistry 18 (12): 2667-2673.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is not the only source of sulfur that Ag will readily bind to. [[Organosulfur compounds]], which are produced by aquatic organisms, form extremely stable sulfide complexes with silver.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Silver outcompetes other metals for the available sulfide, leading to an overall decrease in bioavailable sulfur in the community.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Thus, the formation of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S limits the amount of bioavailable sulfur and contributes to a reduction in toxicity of silver nanoparticles to [[nitrifying bacteria]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Effect on bacteria ====
Silver nanoparticles are experimentally shown to inhibit [[autotroph]]ic nitrifying bacterial growth (86±3%) more than Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (42±7%) or AgCl [[colloid]]s (46±4%).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Silver nanoparticle-inhibited [[heterotroph]]ic growth (55±8%) in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' is best observed at lower concentrations, between 1.0 uM and 4.2 uM.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is less than Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (~100%), but greater than AgCl colloids (66±6%).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The actual cause of these results is undetermined as growth conditions and cell properties differ between nitrifying bacteria and [[heterotroph]]ic ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Within toothpaste, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions have been shown to have a stronger effect on [[gram-negative bacteria]] than on [[gram-positive bacteria]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Junevičius J, Žilinskas J, Česaitis K, Česaitienė G, Gleiznys D, Maželienė D (2015). Antimicrobial activity of silver and gold in toothpastes: A comparative analysis. Stomatologija, Baltic Dental and Maxillofacial Journal, 17 (1): 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to other nanoparticles, such as gold, silver tends to have a broader antimicrobial effect, which is another reason why it is incorporated into so many products.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is less effective on gram-positive bacteria due to the thick layer of peptidoglycan around them that gram-negative species lack.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Approximately half of the [[peptidoglycan]] wall is composed of [[teichoic acid]]s linked by [[phosphodiester bond]]s, which results in an overall negative charge in the peptidoglycan layer.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Vollmer W, Blanot D, Pedro M (2007). Peptidoglycan structure and architecture. Federation of European Microbiological Societies, 32: 149-167.&lt;/ref&gt; This negative charge may trap the positive Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and prevent them from entering the cell and disrupting the flow of electrons.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==== Toxicology in aquatic environments ====
The most environmentally relevant species of these nanoparticles are silver chloride within marine ecosystems and organic thiols within terrestrial ecosystems. Once Ag&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; enters the environment, it is oxidized to Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Su-juan Y, Yong-guang Y, Jing-fu L (2013). Silver nanoparticles in the environment. Environmental Science, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the potential species formed in seawater, such as Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and [[Silver carbonate|Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], AgCl is the most thermodynamically favored due to its stability, solubility, and the abundance of Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; in seawater.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Research has shown that partially oxidized nanoparticles may be more toxic than those that are freshly prepared.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

It was also found that Ag dissolutes more in solution when the pH is low and [[bleaching]] has occurred.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; This effect, coupled with [[ocean acidification]] and increasing coral reef bleaching events, leads to a compounding effect of Ag accumulation in the global marine ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; These free formed Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions can accumulate and block the regulation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion exchange within the gills of fish, leading to blood [[acidosis]] which is fatal if left unchecked. Additionally, fish can accumulate Ag through their diet. [[Phytoplankton]], which form the base level of aquatic food chains, can absorb and collect silver from their surroundings.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Fabrega J, Luoma S, Tyler C, Galloway T, Lead J (2011). Silver nanoparticles: Behaviour and effects in the aquatic environment. Environment International, 37 (2): 517-531.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As fish eat phytoplankton, the silver accumulates within their circulatory system, which has been shown to negatively impact embryonic fish, causing spinal cord deformities and [[Heart arrhythmia|cardiac arrhythmia]].&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The other class of organisms heavily affected by silver nanoparticles is [[Bivalvia|bivalves]].&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Filter feeding bivalves accumulate nanoparticles to concentrations 10,000 times greater than was added to seawater, and Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are proven to be extremely toxic to them.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; 

The base of complex food webs consists of microbes, and these organisms are most heavily impacted by nanoparticles.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; These effects cascade into the problems that have now reached an observable scale.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Lannig G, Eilers S, Pörtner H, Sokolova I and Bock C. (2010). Impact of Ocean Acidification on Energy Metabolism of Oyster, Crassostrea gigas — Changes in Metabolic Pathways and Thermal Response. Marine Drugs 8: 2318-2339.&lt;/ref&gt; As global temperatures rise and oceanic pH drops, some species, such as oysters, will be even more susceptible to the negative impacts of nanoparticles as they are stressed.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

'''Evolutionary anachronism''' is a concept in [[evolutionary biology]], named by Connie C. Barlow in her book ''The Ghosts of Evolution'' (2000),&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;Barlow, Connie C. (2000). ''The Ghosts of Evolution: Nonsensical Fruit, Missing Partners, and Other Ecological Anachronisms''. New York: Basic Books. {{ISBN|9780465005512}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to attributes of living species that are best explained as a result of having been [[natural selection|favorably selected]] in the past due to [[coevolution]] with other biological species that have since become [[extinction|extinct]]. When this context is removed, said attributes appear as unexplained amounts of energy investments on the part of the living organism, with no apparent benefit extracted from them, and can even be [[maladaptation|prejudicial to the continued reproduction of the surviving species]]. The general theory was formulated by [[Costa Rica]]n-based American [[botany|botanist]] [[Daniel Janzen]] and [[University of Arizona]]-based [[geologist]] [[Paul S. Martin]] (a prominent defender of the [[overkill hypothesis]] to explain the [[Quaternary extinction event]]) in a ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' article published in 1982, titled ''Neotropical Anachronisms: The fruit the [[gomphothere]]s ate.''&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt;&lt;ref name="Janzen"&gt;''[https://fission.sas.upenn.edu/caterpillar/index.php?action=retrieve&amp;article=Janzen%2C1982anachronisms.pdf Janzen, D.H. and Martin, P.S. (1981) Neotropical Anachronisms: The Fruits the Gomphotheres Ate. ''Science'', 215(1): 19-27]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously in 1977, [[Stanley Temple]] had proposed a similar idea to explain the decline of the [[Mauritius]] [[endemism|endemic]] tree [[tambalacoque]] following the extinction of the iconic [[dodo]].&lt;ref&gt;Temple, S. A. (August 1977). "[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/197/4306/885.short Plant-Animal Mutualism: Coevolution with Dodo Leads to Near Extinction of Plant]". Science. 197 (4306): 885–886.&lt;/ref&gt;

Janzen, Martin and Barlow mainly discussed evolutionary anachronisms in the context of [[seed dispersal]] and passive defense strategies exhibited by plants that had evolved alongside disappeared [[megaherbivores]]. However, some examples have also been described in animal species. John Byers used the name '''relict behavior''' for [[animal behavior]] examples.&lt;ref name="Byers"&gt;Byers, John, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=H170TWNKyuYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false American Pronghorn: Social Adaptations and the Ghosts of Predators Past] (Chicago: University of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary anachronisms, as properly understood, should not be confused with examples of [[vestigiality]]. Though both concepts refer ultimately to organs that evolved to deal with pressures that are no longer present today, in the anachronisms case, the original function of the organ and the capacity of the organism to use it are still retained intact (e.g. the absence of [[gomphothere]]s to eat avocados doesn't make the avocado's pulp in any way vestigial, rudimentary or intrinsically incapable of playing its original function of helping disperse the avocado's seeds through [[zoochory]], were a new suitable ecological partner to appear; while a true vestigial organ like the [[Pythonidae|python]]'s [[pelvic spur]]s cannot in any way be used to walk again).

==Megafauna dispersal syndrome==
[[Seed dispersal syndrome|Dispersal syndromes]] are complexes of fruit traits that enable plants to disperse seeds. The kind of fruits that birds are attracted to are usually small, with only a thin protective skin, and the colors are red or dark shades of blue or purple. Fruits categorized as mammal syndrome are bigger than bird fruits. They possess a tough rind or husk, emit a strong odor when ripe but retain a dull coloration of brown, burnished yellow, orange or remain green, because most mammals have a powerful sense of smell but poor color vision in general, [[primates]] being the most notable exception. The [[megafauna]] dispersal syndrome refers to those attributes of fruits that evolved in order to attract megafauna (animals that weigh or weighed more than 44 kilograms) as primary dispersal agents. Since the [[Holocene extinction]], large herbivores have become extinct outside [[Africa]] and to a lesser extent [[Asia]], leaving these fruits without a suitable dispersal mechanism in the absence of [[agriculture]].

===Common megafaunal dispersal traits===
[[File:Avocado_with_cross_section_edit.jpg|thumb|[[Avocado]]s are exceptionally fatty fruits, with seeds far too large to be successfully dispersed by any wild animal presently alive in the Americas.]]
*Large fruit, best suited to be consumed whole by large animals without seed loss.
*Fruit grows on or close to the trunk, or on stout branches.
*Indehiscent fruit that retains its seeds upon ripening.
*Seeds deter or elude their own dental grinding through the presence of a thick, tough or hard [[endocarp]]; or bitter, peppering or nausating toxins. They are also difficult to separate from the pulp, which is neither of the previous things, to deter seed spitting.
*The seeds benefit from, or even require physical or chemical abrasion to germinate.
*If tropical, the fruit drops upon or just before ripening, preventing its consumption by [[monkey]]s. In colder climates, the fruit remains on the branch for a prolonged time, keeping it away from predation by ineffectual seed dispersers like [[rodent]]s.
*"Looks, feels, smells, and tastes" like other fruits known to be dispersed by megafauna where megafauna still exists.&lt;ref name="Barlow"/&gt;

===Ecological indicators of missing dispersal partners===
*The fruit either rots where it falls or is ineffectually disseminated by current dispersal agents.
*The plant is more common where [[livestock]] is present (proximegafauna).
*The seeds germinate and grow well in upland habitats where planted but the species almost exclusively inhabits floodplains in the wild.
*The geographic range is inexplicably patchy or restricted.&lt;ref name="Barlow"/&gt;

The seed is in fact too large to be ingested by flying birds, and introduced [[pig]]s and monkeys destroy the seeds rather than disperse them. The tambalacoque evolved locally from smaller-seeded species in the genus ''[[Tambalacoque|Calvaria]]'', which is found in Africa and Madagascar. [[Stanley Temple|Temple]] reported in 1977 that only 13 trees were left, all of them over three hundred years old, and that seeds could not germinate at all without being ingested and abraded first. However, these claims have since been debunked.&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt; || Temple proposed that the tambalacoque had a strict [[mutualism (biology)|mutualist]] relation with the [[dodo]], extinct since c.1662.&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Critics of Temple proposed that the seeds were originally dispersed by a [[giant tortoise]] instead, and that the tambalacoque might even have descended from seeds contained in a tortoise drifting from Madagascar, since tortoises are [[buoyant]] and colonize islands easily. In the [[Galapagos]], ingestion by [[Galapagos giant tortoise|giant tortoises]] reduces [[seed dormancy]] in the Galapagos wild tomato, ''Solanum galapagense.'' Two species of giant tortoise were originally present in Mauritius and went extinct around the same time, the [[Domed Mauritius giant tortoise]] and the [[Saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise]]. However, tambalacoque seeds have harder covers than seeds usually eaten by tortoises, which have no [[gizzard]]; this might imply to a mutualistic relation with a bird after all, and the dodo was the only large enough to ingest the seeds. In any case, it was later found that germination was not favored by ingestion and abrassion of the seeds, but pulp removal. As with ''Mimusops'', the fruit that remains whole is colonized by fungi and its seeds rot.&lt;ref name=Barlow /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The [[broad-billed parrot]] was also a large bird, although a flying one, and had an even more powerful beak than the dodo.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The [[Mauritian giant skink]] is presumed to have been omnivorous.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The [[coconut crab]] existed formerly in Mauritius, but has since disappeared from the island.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

{{annotated image/Extinction}}
An '''extinction''' '''event''' (also known as a '''mass extinction''' or '''biotic crisis''') is a widespread and rapid decrease in the [[biodiversity]] on [[Earth]]. Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of [[multicellular organism]]s. It occurs when the rate of [[extinction]] increases with respect to the rate of [[speciation]]. Because most diversity and [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] on Earth is [[microbial]], and thus difficult to measure, recorded extinction events affect the easily observed, biologically complex component of the [[biosphere]] rather than the total diversity and abundance of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020272| pmid = 15314670| year = 2004| last1 = Nee | first1 = S.| title = Extinction, slime, and bottoms| volume = 2| issue = 8| pages = E272| pmc = 509315| journal = PLoS Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Extinction]] occurs at an uneven rate. Based on the [[fossil record]], the [[background extinction rate|background rate of extinctions]] on Earth is about two to five [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] [[family (biology)|families]] of [[marine animal]]s every million years. Marine fossils are mostly used to measure extinction rates because of their superior fossil record and stratigraphic range compared to [[land animal]]s.

The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] was probably the first major extinction event.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Since the [[Cambrian explosion]] five further major mass extinctions have significantly exceeded the background extinction rate. The most recent and arguably best-known, the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], which occurred approximately {{period start|Paleogene}} million years ago (Ma), was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time.&lt;ref name="Ward 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Impact from the Deep|last = Ward|first = Peter D|date = 2006|journal = Scientific American|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the five major mass extinctions, there are numerous minor ones as well, and the ongoing mass extinction caused by human activity is sometimes called the [[sixth extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;

Estimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540 million years range from as few as five to more than twenty. These differences stem from the threshold chosen for describing an extinction event as "major", and the data chosen to measure past diversity.

[[File:Kainops invius lateral and ventral.JPG|thumb|220px|Trilobites were highly successful marine animals until the Permian–Triassic extinction event wiped them all out]]
In a landmark paper published in 1982, [[Jack Sepkoski]] and [[David M. Raup]] identified five mass extinctions. They were originally identified as outliers to a general trend of decreasing extinction rates during the Phanerozoic,&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt; but as more stringent statistical tests have been applied to the accumulating data, it has been established that multicellular animal life has experienced five major and many minor mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gould, S. J. (2004). The Evolution of Life on Earth,  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, INC|url = |access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Big Five" cannot be so clearly defined, but rather appear to represent the largest (or some of the largest) of a relatively smooth continuum of extinction events.&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt;

# '''[[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events]]''' (End Ordovician or O–S): 450–440&amp;nbsp;Ma (million years ago) at the [[Ordovician]]–[[Silurian]] transition.

Older fossil records are more difficult to interpret. This is because:
* Older fossils are harder to find as they are usually buried at a considerable depth.
* Dating older fossils is more difficult.
* Productive fossil beds are researched more than unproductive ones, therefore leaving certain periods unresearched.
* Prehistoric environmental events can disturb the [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] process.
* The preservation of fossils varies on land, but marine fossils tend to be better preserved than their sought after land-based counterparts.&lt;ref name="sole"&gt;Sole, R.V., and Newman, M., 2002.

More recent research has indicated that the '''[[End-Capitanian extinction event]]''' likely constitutes a separate extinction event from the Permian–Triassic extinction event; if so, it would be larger than many of the "Big Five" extinction events.

==Evolutionary importance==
{{Life timeline}}
Mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the [[evolution]] of [[life|life on Earth]]. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is "superior" to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Benton | first =M.J. |authorlink = Michael Benton| title=Vertebrate Palaeontology | publisher=Blackwell | year=2004 | chapter=6. Reptiles Of The Triassic | url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=0632056371 | isbn=0-04-566002-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Van Valkenburgh | first= B.| year=1999 | title=Major patterns in the history of carnivorous mammals | journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences| volume= 27| pages= 463–493 | doi= 10.1146/annurev.earth.27.1.463|bibcode = 1999AREPS..27..463V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[mammaliformes]] ("almost mammals") and then [[mammal]]s existed throughout the reign of the [[dinosaur]]s, but could not compete for the large terrestrial vertebrate niches which dinosaurs monopolized. The [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|end-Cretaceous]] mass extinction removed the non-avian dinosaurs and made it possible for mammals to expand into the large terrestrial vertebrate niches. Ironically, the dinosaurs themselves had been beneficiaries of a previous mass extinction, the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|end-Triassic]], which eliminated most of their chief rivals, the [[crurotarsans]].

Another point of view put forward in the [[Escalation hypothesis]] predicts that species in ecological niches with more organism-to-organism conflict will be less likely to survive extinctions. This is because the very traits that keep a species numerous and viable under fairly static conditions become a burden once population levels fall among competing organisms during the dynamics of an extinction event.

Furthermore, many groups which survive mass extinctions do not recover in numbers or diversity, and many of these go into long-term decline, and these are often referred to as "[[Dead Clade Walking|Dead Clades Walking]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Jablonski| first= D.| year=2002| doi= 10.1073/pnas.102163299| title=Survival without recovery after mass extinctions| journal=PNAS| volume= 99| issue=12| pages= 8139–8144| pmid=12060760| pmc=123034|bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.8139J }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, clades that survive for a considerable period of time after a mass extinction, and which were reduced to only a few species, are likely to have experienced a rebound effect called the "[[push of the past]]"&lt;ref name="POTPa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budd |first1=G.

Darwin was firmly of the opinion that biotic interactions, such as competition for food and space—the ‘struggle for existence’—were of considerably greater importance in promoting evolution and extinction than changes in the physical environment. He expressed this in ''The Origin of Species'': "Species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting causes…and the most import of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered…physical conditions, namely the mutual relation of organism to organism-the improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or extermination of others".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hallam, Anthony]], &amp; Wignall, P. B. (2002). Mass Extinctions and Their Aftermath. New York: Oxford University Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patterns in frequency==
It has been suggested variously that extinction events occurred periodically, every 26 to 30&amp;nbsp;million years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Star-struck?|last = Beardsley|first = Tim|date = 1988|journal = Scientific American|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Raup1984&gt;{{Cite journal

However, even after accounting for sampling bias, there does appear to be a gradual decrease in extinction and origination rates during the Phanerozoic.&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt; This may represent the fact that groups with higher turnover rates are more likely to become extinct by chance; or it may be an artefact of taxonomy: families tend to become more speciose, therefore less prone to extinction, over time;&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt; and larger taxonomic groups (by definition) appear earlier in geological time.&lt;ref name="Budd2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Budd | first1 = G.

It has also been suggested that the oceans have gradually become more hospitable to life over the last 500 million years, and thus less vulnerable to mass extinctions,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Dissolved oxygen]] became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of [[eutrophication]] and [[anoxic event]]s; and marine ecosystems became more diversified so that [[food chain]]s were less likely to be disrupted.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Martin| first= R.E.| year=1995| title=Cyclic and secular variation in microfossil biomineralization: clues to the biogeochemical evolution of Phanerozoic oceans| journal=Global and Planetary Change| volume =11| issue= 1| doi=10.1016/0921-8181(94)00011-2| pages=1–23|bibcode = 1995GPC....11....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Martin| first1 = R.E.| year = 1996| title = Secular increase in nutrient levels through the Phanerozoic: Implications for productivity, biomass, and diversity of the marine biosphere| journal = PALAIOS| volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = 209–219| doi = 10.2307/3515230| jstor = 3515230}}&lt;/ref&gt; but susceptibility to extinction at a taxonomic level does not appear to make mass extinctions more or less probable.&lt;ref name=Wang2008/&gt;

==Causes==
There is still debate about the causes of all mass extinctions. In general, large extinctions may result when a biosphere under long-term stress undergoes a short-term shock.&lt;ref name="Arens2008"/&gt; An underlying mechanism appears to be present in the correlation of extinction and origination rates to diversity. High diversity leads to a persistent increase in extinction rate; low diversity to a persistent increase in origination rate. These presumably ecologically controlled relationships likely amplify smaller perturbations (asteroid impacts, etc.) to produce the global effects observed.&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt;

===Identifying causes of particular mass extinctions===
A good theory for a particular mass extinction should: (i) explain all of the losses, not just focus on a few groups (such as dinosaurs); (ii) explain why particular groups of organisms died out and why others survived; (iii) provide mechanisms which are strong enough to cause a mass extinction but not a total extinction; (iv) be based on events or processes that can be shown to have happened, not just inferred from the extinction.

It may be necessary to consider combinations of causes. For example, the marine aspect of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|end-Cretaceous]] extinction appears to have been caused by several processes which partially overlapped in time and may have had different levels of significance in different parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Marshall | first=C.R. | last2=Ward | first2=P.D. | title=Sudden and Gradual Molluscan Extinctions in the Latest Cretaceous of Western European Tethys | journal=Science | volume=274 | pages=1360–1363 | year=1996 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/274/5291/1360?ijkey=ea611116afd7f95233c7b9b1451b6f16702ed11e | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5291.1360 | pmid=8910273 | issue=5291|bibcode = 1996Sci...274.1360M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arens and West (2006) proposed a "press / pulse" model in which mass extinctions generally require two types of cause: long-term pressure on the eco-system ("press") and a sudden catastrophe ("pulse") towards the end of the period of pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Arens, N.C. and West, I.D. (2006). "Press/Pulse: A General Theory of Mass Extinction?" 'GSA Conference paper' [http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2006AM/finalprogram/abstract_111772.htm Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;
Their statistical analysis of marine extinction rates throughout the [[Phanerozoic]] suggested that neither long-term pressure alone nor a catastrophe alone was sufficient to cause a significant increase in the extinction rate.

The most commonly suggested causes of mass extinctions are listed below.

====Flood basalt events====
The formation of [[large igneous province]]s by flood basalt events could have:
* produced dust and [[particulates|particulate]] aerosols which inhibited photosynthesis and thus caused [[food chain]]s to collapse both on land and at sea&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v263/n4/pdf/scientificamerican1090-85.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* emitted sulfur oxides which were precipitated as [[acid rain]] and poisoned many organisms, contributing further to the collapse of food chains
* emitted [[carbon dioxide]] and thus possibly causing [[greenhouse effect|sustained global warming]] once the dust and particulate aerosols dissipated.
Flood basalt events occur as pulses of activity punctuated by dormant periods. As a result, they are likely to cause the climate to oscillate between cooling and warming, but with an overall trend towards warming as the carbon dioxide they emit can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

It is speculated that massive volcanism caused or contributed to the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|End-Permian]], [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|End-Triassic]] and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|End-Cretaceous]] extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://park.org/Canada/Museum/extinction/cretcause.html|title=Causes of the Cretaceous Extinction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between gigantic volcanic events expressed in the large igneous provinces and mass extinctions was shown for the last 260 Myr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Courtillot | first1 = V. | year = 1994 | title = Mass extinctions in the last 300 million years: one impact and seven flood basalts? | url = | journal = Israel Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 255–266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtillot, V. E., Renne, P. R., 2003. On the ages of flood basalt events. Comptes Rendus Geosciences 335 (1), 113–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently such possible correlation was extended for the whole Phanerozoic Eon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kravchinsky | first1 = V.

====Sea-level falls====
These are often clearly marked by worldwide sequences of contemporaneous sediments which show all or part of a transition from sea-bed to tidal zone to beach to dry land – and where there is no evidence that the rocks in the relevant areas were raised by geological processes such as [[orogeny]]. Sea-level falls could reduce the continental shelf area (the most productive part of the oceans) sufficiently to cause a marine mass extinction, and could disrupt weather patterns enough to cause extinctions on land. But sea-level falls are very probably the result of other events, such as sustained global cooling or the sinking of the [[plate tectonics|mid-ocean ridges]].

Sea-level falls are associated with most of the mass extinctions, including all of the "Big Five"—[[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|End-Ordovician]], [[Late Devonian extinction|Late Devonian]], [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|End-Permian]], [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|End-Triassic]], and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|End-Cretaceous]].

A study, published in the journal Nature (online June 15, 2008) established a relationship between the speed of mass extinction events and changes in sea level and sediment.&lt;ref name=Peters2008&gt;{{cite journal

|bibcode = 2008Natur.454..626P }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The study suggests changes in ocean environments related to sea level exert a driving influence on rates of extinction, and generally determine the composition of life in the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541743/ Newswise: Ebb and Flow of the Sea Drives World's Big Extinction Events] Retrieved on June 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact events====
The impact of a sufficiently large asteroid or comet could have caused [[food chain]]s to collapse both on land and at sea by producing dust and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] aerosols and thus inhibiting photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impact theory of mass extinctions and the invertebrate fossil record|first = Walter|date = Mar 16, 1984|journal = Science|doi = 10.1126/science.223.4641.1135|pmid = 17742919|last = Alvarez|last2 = Kauffman|first2 = Erle|issue = 4641|volume = 223|pages = 1135–1141|last3 = Surlyk|first3 = Finn|last4 = Alvarez|first4 = Luis|last5 = Asaro|first5 = Frank|last6 = Michel|first6 = Helen|jstor=1692570|bibcode = 1984Sci...223.1135A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impacts on [[sulfur]]-rich rocks could have emitted sulfur oxides precipitating as poisonous [[acid rain]], contributing further to the collapse of food chains. Such impacts could also have caused [[megatsunami]]s and/or global [[forest fire]]s.

Most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the Earth about 66&amp;nbsp;Ma ago, but there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].&lt;ref name="Keller_2009"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keller G, Abramovich S, Berner Z, Adatte T | journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology| volume=271| issue=1–2| date=1 January 2009| pages=52–68| title=Biotic effects of the Chicxulub impact, K–T catastrophe and sea level change in Texas| doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Analyses of shocked quartz at the global K-P boundary indicate an origin from a single, high-angle, oblique impact at Chicxulub |vauthors=Morgan J, Lana C, Kersley A, Coles B, Belcher C, Montanari S, Diaz-Martinez E, Barbosa A, Neumann V |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=251 |issue=3–4 |year=2006 |pages=264–279 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.009 |bibcode=2006E&amp;PSL.251..264M|url=http://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/1208/1/EPSL-D-05-00905%5b1%5d.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global cooling====
Sustained and significant global cooling could kill many [[Polar circle|polar]] and [[temperate]] species and force others to migrate towards the [[equator]]; reduce the area available for [[Tropics|tropical]] species; often make the Earth's climate more arid on average, mainly by locking up more of the planet's water in ice and snow. The [[glaciation]] cycles of the [[current ice age]] are believed to have had only a very mild impact on biodiversity, so the mere existence of a significant cooling is not sufficient on its own to explain a mass extinction.

It has been suggested that global cooling caused or contributed to the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|End-Ordovician]], [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]], [[Late Devonian extinction|Late Devonian]] extinctions, and possibly others. Sustained global cooling is distinguished from the temporary climatic effects of flood basalt events or impacts.

====Global warming====
This would have the opposite effects: expand the area available for [[Tropics|tropical]] species; kill [[temperate]] species or force them to migrate towards the [[Polar circle|poles]]; possibly cause severe extinctions of polar species; often make the Earth's climate wetter on average, mainly by melting ice and snow and thus increasing the volume of the [[water cycle]]. It might also cause anoxic events in the oceans (see below).

Global warming as a cause of mass extinction is supported by several recent studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mayhew|first=Peter J. |author2=Gareth B. Jenkins|author3=Timothy G. Benton|date=January 7, 2008|title=A long-term association between global temperature and biodiversity, origination and extinction in the fossil record|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=275|issue=1630|pages=47–53|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1630/47.full|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1302|pmid=17956842|pmc=2562410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most dramatic example of sustained warming is the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]], which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions. It has also been suggested to have caused the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]], during which 20% of all marine families became extinct. Furthermore, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] has been suggested to have been caused by warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knoll|first1=A. H.|last2=Bambach|first2=R.

====Clathrate gun hypothesis====
{{Main|Clathrate gun hypothesis}}
[[Clathrates]] are composites in which a lattice of one substance forms a cage around another. [[Methane clathrate]]s (in which water molecules are the cage) form on [[continental shelf|continental shelves]]. These clathrates are likely to break up rapidly and release the methane if the temperature rises quickly or the pressure on them drops quickly—for example in response to sudden [[global warming]] or a sudden drop in sea level or even [[earthquake]]s. Methane is a much more powerful [[greenhouse effect|greenhouse]] gas than carbon dioxide, so a methane eruption ("clathrate gun") could cause rapid global warming or make it much more severe if the eruption was itself caused by global warming.

The most likely signature of such a methane eruption would be a sudden decrease in the [[Isotope analysis|ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12]] in sediments, since methane clathrates are low in carbon-13; but the change would have to be very large, as other events can also reduce the percentage of carbon-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Hecht | first=J | title=Methane prime suspect for greatest mass extinction | publisher=New Scientist | date=2002-03-26 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn2088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that "clathrate gun" methane eruptions were involved in the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|end-Permian extinction]] ("the Great Dying") and in the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]], which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions.

====Anoxic events====
[[Anoxic event]]s are situations in which the middle and even the upper layers of the ocean become deficient or totally lacking in oxygen. Their causes are complex and controversial, but all known instances are associated with severe and sustained global warming, mostly caused by sustained massive volcanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Geochemistry of oceanic anoxic events|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009GC002788/abstract|journal = Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems|date = 2010-03-01|issn = 1525-2027|pages = Q03004|volume = 11|issue = 3|doi = 10.1029/2009GC002788|language = en|first = Hugh C.|last = Jenkyns|bibcode=2010GGG....11.3004J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that anoxic events caused or contributed to the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|Ordovician–Silurian]], [[Late Devonian extinction|late Devonian]], [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]] and [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|Triassic–Jurassic]] extinctions, as well as a number of lesser extinctions (such as the [[Ireviken event|Ireviken]], [[Mulde event|Mulde]], [[Lau event|Lau]], [[Toarcian turnover|Toarcian]] and Cenomanian–Turonian events). On the other hand, there are widespread black shale beds from the mid-Cretaceous which indicate anoxic events but are not associated with mass extinctions.

The [[bio-availability]] of [[Essential (biology)|essential]] [[trace element]]s (in particular [[selenium]]) to potentially lethal lows has been shown to coincide with, and likely have contributed to, at least three mass extinction events in the oceans, i.e. at the end of the Ordovician, during the Middle and Late Devonian, and at the end of the Triassic. During periods of low oxygen concentrations very soluble [[selenate]] (Se&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;) is converted into much less soluble [[selenide]] (Se&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;), elemental Se and organo-selenium complexes. Bio-availability of selenium during these extinction events dropped to about 1% of the current oceanic concentration, a level that has been proven lethal to many [[Extant taxon|extant]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Long|first1= J.|last2= Large|first2= R.R.|last3= Lee|first3= M.S.Y.|last4= Benton|first4= M.

====Hydrogen sulfide emissions from the seas====
Kump, Pavlov and Arthur (2005) have proposed that during the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] the warming also upset the oceanic balance between [[photosynthesis]]ing plankton and deep-water [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]], causing massive emissions of [[hydrogen sulfide]] which poisoned life on both land and sea and severely weakened the [[ozone layer]], exposing much of the life that still remained to fatal levels of [[UV radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Berner, R. A., and Ward, P. D. (2004). "[http://www.gsajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-static&amp;name=i0091-7613-31-6-e100 Positive Reinforcement, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, and the Permo-Triassic Extinction: Comment and Reply]" describes possible [[positive feedback]] loops in the catastrophic release of [[hydrogen sulfide]] proposed by Kump, Pavlov and Arthur (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kump | first1 = L.

====Oceanic overturn====
Oceanic overturn is a disruption of [[thermo-haline circulation]] which lets surface water (which is more saline than deep water because of evaporation) sink straight down, bringing anoxic deep water to the surface and therefore killing most of the oxygen-breathing organisms which inhabit the surface and middle depths. It may occur either at the beginning or the end of a [[glaciation]], although an overturn at the start of a glaciation is more dangerous because the preceding warm period will have created a larger volume of anoxic water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Wilde | first=P | last2=Berry | first2=W.B.N. | title=Destabilization of the oceanic density structure and its significance to marine "extinction" events | journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume=48 | issue=2–4 | pages=143–162 | year=1984 | url=http://www.marscigrp.org/ppp84.html | doi=10.1016/0031-0182(84)90041-5 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| bibcode=1984PPP....48..143W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other oceanic catastrophes such as regressions (sea-level falls) and anoxic events, overturns do not leave easily identified "signatures" in rocks and are theoretical consequences of researchers' conclusions about other climatic and marine events.

It has been suggested that oceanic overturn caused or contributed to the [[Late Devonian extinction|late Devonian]] and [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]] extinctions.

====A nearby nova, supernova or gamma ray burst====
A nearby [[gamma-ray burst]] (less than 6000 [[light-year]]s away) would be powerful enough to destroy the Earth's [[ozone layer]], leaving organisms vulnerable to [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] from the Sun.&lt;ref name="20 ways"&gt;{{cite web| title=20 Ways the World Could End| publisher=Discover Magazine| author=[[Corey S.

It has been suggested that a supernova or gamma ray burst caused the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|End-Ordovician]] extinction.&lt;ref name="Melott &amp; Thomas 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Melott, A.

====Geomagnetic reversal====
One theory is that periods of increased [[geomagnetic reversal]]s will weaken [[Earth's magnetic field]] long enough to expose the atmosphere to the [[solar wind]]s, causing oxygen ions to escape the atmosphere in a rate increased by 3–4 orders, resulting in a disastrous decrease in oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Oxygen escape from the Earth during geomagnetic reversals: Implications to mass extinction|first1=Yong|last1=Wei|first2=Zuyin|last2=Pu|first3=Qiugang|last3=Zong|first4=Weixing|last4=Wan|first5=Zhipeng|last5=Ren|first6=Markus|last6=Fraenz|first7=Eduard|last7=Dubinin|first8=Feng|last8=Tian|first9=Quanqi|last9=Shi|first10=Suiyan|last10=Fu|first11=Minghua|last11=Hong|date=1 May 2014|publisher=|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=394|pages=94–98|via=NASA ADS|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2014.03.018|bibcode=2014E&amp;PSL.394...94W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plate tectonics====
Movement of the continents into some configurations can cause or contribute to extinctions in several ways: by initiating or ending [[ice age]]s; by changing ocean and wind currents and thus altering climate; by opening seaways or land bridges which expose previously isolated species to competition for which they are poorly adapted (for example, the extinction of most of South America's [[Meridiungulata|native ungulates]] and all of its [[Sparassodonta|large metatherians]] after the [[Great American Interchange|creation of a land bridge between North and South America]]). Occasionally continental drift creates a super-continent which includes the vast majority of Earth's land area, which in addition to the effects listed above is likely to reduce the total area of [[continental shelf]] (the most species-rich part of the ocean) and produce a vast, arid continental interior which may have extreme seasonal variations.

Another theory is that the creation of the super-continent [[Pangaea]] contributed to the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|End-Permian]] mass extinction. Pangaea was almost fully formed at the transition from mid-Permian to late-Permian, and the "Marine genus diversity" diagram at the top of this article shows a level of extinction starting at that time which might have qualified for inclusion in the "Big Five" if it were not overshadowed by the "Great Dying" at the end of the Permian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Speculated Causes of the Permian Extinction |publisher=Hooper Virtual Paleontological Museum |url=http://park.org/Canada/Museum/extinction/permcause.html |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other hypotheses====
Many other hypotheses have been proposed, such as the spread of a new disease, or simple out-competition following an especially successful biological innovation. But all have been rejected, usually for one of the following reasons: they require events or processes for which there is no evidence; they assume mechanisms which are contrary to the available evidence; they are based on other theories which have been rejected or superseded.

Scientists have been concerned that human activities could cause more plants and animals to become extinct than any point in the past. Along with human-made changes in climate (see above), some of these extinctions could be caused by overhunting, overfishing, invasive species, or habitat loss. A study published in May 2017 in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' argued that a “biological annihilation” akin to a sixth mass extinction event is underway as a result of anthropogenic causes, such as [[Human overpopulation|over-population]] and [[Overconsumption|over-consumption]]. The study suggested that as much as 50% of the number of animal individuals that once lived on Earth were already extinct, threatening the basis for human existence too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ceballos|first=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul R.|last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=2017-07-10|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|pages=E6089–E6096|doi=10.1073/pnas.1704949114|issn=0027-8424|pmc=5544311|pmid=28696295|volume=114|issue=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sutter"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sutter|first=John D.|date=July 11, 2017|title=Sixth mass extinction: The era of 'biological annihilation'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/world/sutter-mass-extinction-ceballos-study/index.html|work=[[CNN]]|location= |access-date=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future biosphere extinction/sterilization====
{{See also|Future of Earth| Medea hypothesis|Fermi paradox}}
The eventual warming and expanding of the Sun, combined with the eventual decline of atmospheric carbon dioxide could actually cause an even greater mass extinction, having the potential to wipe out even microbes (in other words, the Earth is completely sterilized), where rising global temperatures caused by the expanding Sun will gradually increase the rate of weathering, which in turn removes more and more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When carbon dioxide levels get too low (perhaps at 50 ppm), all plant life will die out, although simpler plants like grasses and mosses can survive much longer, until {{CO2}} levels drop to 10 ppm.&lt;ref name= Franck2005&gt;{{cite journal

With all photosynthetic organisms gone, atmospheric oxygen can no longer be replenished, and is eventually removed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere, perhaps from volcanic eruptions. Eventually the loss of oxygen will cause all remaining aerobic life to die out via asphyxiation, leaving behind only simple anaerobic prokaryotes. When the Sun becomes 10% brighter in about a billion years,&lt;ref name= Franck2005/&gt; Earth will suffer a moist greenhouse effect resulting in its oceans boiling away, while the Earth's liquid outer core cools due to the inner core's expansion and causes the Earth's magnetic field to shut down. In the absence of a magnetic field, charged particles from the Sun will deplete the atmosphere and further increase the Earth's temperature to an average of ~420 K (147&amp;nbsp;°C, 296&amp;nbsp;°F) in 2.8 billion years, causing the last remaining life on Earth to die out. This is the most extreme instance of a climate-caused extinction event. Since this will only happen late in the Sun's life, such will cause the final mass extinction in Earth's history (albeit a very long extinction event).&lt;ref name= Franck2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ward2003/&gt;

==Effects and recovery==
The impact of mass extinction events varied widely. After a major extinction event, usually only [[weed#Weeds as adaptable species|weedy species]] survive due to their ability to live in diverse habitats.&lt;ref name=Quammen&gt;{{Cite web |title=Planet of Weeds |author=David Quammen |work=Harper's Magazine |date=October 1998 |url= http://sep.csumb.edu/class/ESSP645/readings/Quammen%201998.pdf |accessdate=November 15, 2012 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, species diversify and occupy empty niches. Generally, [[biodiversity]] recovers 5 to 10 million years after the extinction event. In the most severe mass extinctions it may take 15 to 30 million years.&lt;ref name="Quammen" /&gt;

The worst event, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic extinction]], devastated life on earth, killing over 90% of species. Life seemed to recover quickly after the P-T extinction, but this was mostly in the form of [[pioneer organism|disaster taxa]], such as the hardy ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The most recent research indicates that the specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems, with high biodiversity, complex food webs and a variety of niches, took much longer to recover. It is thought that this long recovery was due to successive waves of extinction which inhibited recovery, as well as prolonged environmental stress which continued into the Early Triassic. Recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, 4M to 6M years after the extinction;&lt;ref name="LehrmannRamezanBowring2006TimingOfRecovery"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Timing of recovery from the end-Permian extinction: Geochronologic and biostratigraphic constraints from south China | author=Lehrmann | journal=Geology |date=December 2006 | volume=34 | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/12/1053 | pages=1053–1056 | doi=10.1130/G22827A.1 | issue=12 |bibcode = 2006Geo....34.1053L | author2=D.J. | author3=Ramezan | author4=J. | author5=Bowring | author6=S.A. | display-authors=6 | last7=Payne | first7=Jonathan L. | last8=Orchard | first8=Michael J. | last9=Hongmei | first9=Wang }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until 30M years after the P-T extinction, i.e. in the late Triassic.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759 | author1=Sahney, S.|author2= Benton, M.J. |authorlink2= Michael Benton| year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65 | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent to the P-T extinction, there was an increase in provincialization, with species occupying smaller ranges – perhaps removing incumbents from niches and setting the stage for an eventual rediversification.&lt;ref name="Sidor2013"&gt;{{cite journal  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1302323110  | title = Provincialization of terrestrial faunas following the end-Permian mass extinction  | year = 2013  | last1 = Sidor | first1 = C.

The effects of mass extinctions on plants are somewhat harder to quantify, given the biases inherent in the plant fossil record. Some mass extinctions (such as the end-Permian) were equally catastrophic for plants, whereas others, such as the end-Devonian, did not affect the flora.&lt;ref name="Cascales-Miñana2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cascales-Miñana | first1 = B. | last2 = Cleal | first2 = C.

[[File:Wappen_himmelsberg_hessen.svg|thumb|280px| [[Himmelsberg]] Dance Linden, in the court of arms of Himmelsberg village]]

In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a '''{{lang|de|Gerichtslinde}}''' (German for "court linden, [[dōm|doom]] linden"; plural {{lang|de|-linden}}) was a [[linden tree]] where assemblies and judicial [[court]]s were held. Rooted in [[Germanic tribal law]], the custom has left traces through the [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]]-speaking areas.

Court lindens usually were situated outside settlements in open fields "under the free heaven". When located in the center of its village, the tree was also at the center of festivities, in this respect known as '''{{lang|de|Tanzlinde}}''' "dance linden". After [[Christianization]], the linden remained associated with justice and benevolent protection, often re-dedicated to [[Mary mother of Jesus]] ({{lang|de|Marienlinden}}) or to the [[twelve Apostles]] ({{lang|de|Apostellinden}}).

==History==
Many surviving linden trees may sometimes retain names {{lang|de|Thie-Linde}}, {{lang|de|Thing-Linde}} or {{lang|de|Tilly-Linde}}, but often simply {{lang|de|Dorflinde}} "village linden". The oldest of them is in [[Schenklengsfeld]], [[Hesse]], planted in the 9th century, in the time of [[Louis the Younger]].

The 12th century ''[[Visio Godeschalci]]'' describes a journey which the pious [[Holstein]] peasant Godeskalk believed he had made in the lower world. There is mentioned an immensely large and beautiful linden-tree hanging full of shoes, which were handed down to such dead travellers as had exercised mercy during their lives.

Numerous examples of sacred trees and [[sacred groves|groves]] exist amongst the pre-Christian [[Germanic peoples]]. The linden is often claimed to have been sacred to [[Freyja]] in the pre-Christian period, forming a polarity with the [[Donar's Oak|oaks]] sacred to [[Donar]].&lt;ref&gt;The idea can be traced to Karl Strackerjan, ''ist die Eiche oder die Linde der Baum des Deutschen Volkes?'' Oldenburg (1874). C.f. Uwe Hentschel, ''Der Lindenbaum in der deutschen Literatur des 18. und 19. Jahrhunderts'', Orbis Litterarum 60:5 (2005), 357-376 [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0730.2005.00843.x]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specimens==
Notable specimens are found in [[Bargischow]], [[Castell]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Großgoltern]], [[Herzogenreuth]], [[Himmelsberg]] (Hesse), [[Hohenpölz]], [[Kierspe]], [[Müden (Örtze)|Müden an der Örtze]], [[Neuenrade]], [[Salzhemmendorf]], [[Sachsenbrunn]] [[Schaumburg]], [[Bockenem|Upstedt]], Waldtann ([[Kreßberg]]) and [[Warmsen]].

The [[Frilandsmuseet|Danish Open Air Museum]] in northern [[Copenhagen]] displays a reconstruction of such a village meeting place for a medieval-era village originally found on the island of [[Funen]], [[Denmark]]. Each tenant farmer had his own stone seat beneath the linden and the meeting was presided over by the village elder ({{lang-da|oldermand}}, cognate "alderman").&lt;ref name=VILLAGEFUNEN69&gt;Exhibit number 69, "Bystaevne Fyn"/"Village Meeting Place Funen", [[Open Air Museum (Kongens Lyngby)|Open Air Museum]], [[Kongens Lyngby]], [[Denmark]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponyms==
The name of [[Malters]], [[Canton of Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]], derives from {{lang|goh|*mahal-tre}} "[[Thing (assembly)|thing]]-tree".

Professor '''Helene Denise Marsh''' [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science|FAA]] [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering|FTSE]] (born 8 April 1945) is an Australian scientist who has provided research in the field of [[Environmental Science]], more specifically [[Zoology]] and [[Ecology]]. The focal point of her research has been the biology of [[dugongs]], with particular foci in the areas of population ecology, history, reproduction, diet, and movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helene|url=http://www.helenemarsh.com/|website=Helene Marsh|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the Dean of Graduate Research Studies and the Professor of Environmental Science at [[James Cook University]] in Queensland, Australia, and also a Distinguished Professor in the College of Marine and Environmental Science. Marsh is also a program leader for the Marine and Tropical Research Science Facility. In 2015 she was elected a Fellow of both the [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science|Australian Academy of Science]] (FAA), and the [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering|Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering]] (FTSE).

== Early life ==
Marsh's parents always encouraged her to succeed academically, placing value on learning and education throughout her childhood, and expected that all three of their children would eventually attend a university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tyndale-Briscoe|first1=Dr. Hugh|title=Interviews with Australian Scientists|url=http://www.sciencearchive.org.au/scientists/interviews/m/hm.html|website=Australian Academy of Science|publisher=Australian Academy of Science|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother started out as a teacher, then when [[World War II]] began she enlisted and became the only woman education officer in the Army from Northern Territory. After the war she earned her master's degree. Her father earned degrees in both [[Economics]] and [[Law]]; he died when Marsh was 13 years old. She has two brothers, one became a Professor of English at the [[University of London]], while the other made films.

== Education ==
Marsh graduated from the [[University of Queensland]] in 1968, earning a Bachelor of Science with Honors in Zoology, going on to earn her Ph.D. in Zoology from James Cook University in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Marsh, H. (Helene) (1945-) | journal=Trove | publication-date=2011 | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.party-618483 | access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 Marsh became a Professor of Zoology and Director of Environmental Studies at James Cook University, staying in this position until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=G.J.|last2=Walker|first2=R.H.|title=Marsh, Helene Denise (1945 - )|url=http://www.eoas.info/biogs/P001439b.htm|website=Encyclopedia of Australian Science|publisher=Encyclopedia of Australian Science|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 she became the Professor of Environmental Science and the Head of the Department of Tropical Environmental Studies and Geography. In 2000 Marsh became the Dean of Postgraduate Studies. Over the course of her career she has also assisted and supervised 55 Ph.D. and 20 Master's candidates through to their completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Helene Marsh|url=https://research.jcu.edu.au/portfolio/helene.marsh|website=James Cook University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After earning her Bachelor's degree in 1968, Marsh began work for the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) in 1968 as an Experimental Officer in Animal Health at the CSIRO research laboratory in [[Townsville, Queensland]]. In 1972 she worked as an Honorary Research Associate at the [[British Museum of Natural History]]. After two years she returned to James Cook University where she was appointed as a Research Officer in Zoology, eventually being promoted to the part-time position of Research Fellow in Zoology in 1976. She switched to full-time in 1981. Through the 1980s and 1990s she secured multiple positions on various committees at James Cook University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3230">The '''INF World Rankings''' are published by the [[International Netball Federation]] (INF) to make it possible to compare the relative strengths of internationally active national [[netball]] teams. Initially, rankings were based on the results from the [[World Netball Championships]], and released after the conclusion of each event, every four years. A new ranking system was implemented on 11 February 2008, wherein teams are ranked based on international [[Test match (netball)|tests]] played, currently since July 2010. Teams appear on the rankings list once they have played eight international test matches, starting from July 2010. The rankings are updated by the INF every month. Australia and New Zealand have dominated the INF world rankings in previous years and they are the only two netball nations to have ever held the number one world ranking since its introduction in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3288">The '''International Society of Limnology''' is an international [[scientific society]] that disseminates information among [[limnology|limnologists]], those who study all aspects of inland waters, including their [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], and management. It was founded by [[August Thienemann]] and [[Einar Naumann]] in 1922 as the  International Association of Theoretical and Applied Limnology and Societas Internationalis Limnologiae, SIL.
 
It had about 2.800 members in 2008.

SIL publishes the following  scientific publications: 
* the journal ''Fundamental and Applied Limnology:Archiv für Hydrobiologie''  {{ISSN|1863-9135}} ; prior to 2007, it was called ''Archiv für Hydrobiologie''.
* Communications (Mitteilungen), irregular publication.
* Limnology in Developing Countries, a book series.
* Congress proceedings, until 2007, published  as ''Verhandlungen Internationale Vereinigung für theoretische und angewandte Limnologie''.
* SIL has discontinued publication of the Verhandlungen and has replaced it with a peer-reviewed journal entitled ''Inland Waters''. The new journal was launched at the [http://sil2010.ufs.ac.za/ 31st SIL Congress in Cape Town, 2010], with first publication in 2011. The journal is supported by the electronic submission and tracking system of the [[Freshwater Biological Association]]. Manuscripts will be published consecutively online (as accepted) and quarterly in paper format. Access to the electronic version is provided to all SIL members and subscribers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1879">'''Joachim Luther''' (born March 31, 1941, in [[Hannover]], Germany) received his PhD in
experimental physics at the [[University of Hannover]] in 1970. In 1974, he became professor of laser physics at the [[University of Oldenburg]]. In the beginning of the 1980s, his scientific interest shifted towards [[renewable energy]] sources like [[solar power]] and [[wind power]]. Since 1993, Luther headed  the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE]] in Freiburg, Germany, then establishing it as the largest research center for solar
energy in Europe.  Professor Luther retired from ISE in 2006. In 2008, he was asked to head the newly
founded Solar Energy Research Institute of [[Singapore]] (SERIS).

Joachim Luther served as member of leading advisory boards on renewable energy in Germany and in the [[European Union]]. He also was elected, in 1999, to be the Editor-in-Chief of the journal  [[Solar Energy (journal)|Solar Energy]].

In 2005, Luther was awarded the prestigious [[Becquerel Prize]] and the  
[[Environment Prize (German Environment Foundation)|German Environment Foundation]] prize.  In 2008, he was named one of the [[Heroes of the Environment (2008)]] by the [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6862">{{Greek myth (nymph)}}

In [[classical mythology|Greco-Roman mythology]], '''Leuce''' ({{lang-grc|Λεύκη}}, "White", specifically "[[populus alba|White Poplar]]") was the most beautiful of the [[nymph]]s and a daughter of [[Oceanus]]. [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] fell in love with her and abducted her to the underworld. She lived out the span of her life in his realm, and when she died, the god sought consolation by creating a suitable memorial of their love: in the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] where the pious spend their afterlife, he brought a white tree into existence. It was this tree with which [[Heracles]] crowned himself to celebrate his [[descent to the underworld|return from the underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]], note to ''[[Eclogues|Eclogue]]'' 7.61: ''Leuce, Oceani filia, inter nymphas pulcherrima fuit. hanc Pluton adamavit et ad inferos rapuit. quae postquam apud eum completo vitae suae tempore mortua est, Pluton tam in amoris, quam in memoriae solacium in Elysiis piorum campis leucen nasci arborem iussit, ex qua, sicut dictum est, Hercules se, revertens ab inferis, coronavit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology of the poplar==
[[File:Populus alba leaf.jpg|thumb|The two sides of the white poplar leaf]]
Maurus [[Servius]] Honoratus identifies the tree as the [[Populus alba|white poplar]], the leaf of which is distinctively two-sided, one white and one dark. The double color, Servius says, made a wreath that represented the duality of the hero's [[Labours of Hercules|labors]] in both the upper and the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;''Qua corona usus, duplici colore foliorum geminos labores (superorum) inferorumque testatus est.'' See also [[Isidore of Seville]], ''[[Etymologiae]]'' 17.4.45: "The white poplar is named because its leaves are white on one side and green on the other. It is therefore two-colored, having marks as if of day and night, which correspond to the times of the rising and setting of the sun" (translation by [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jjsJ9NP6hYC&amp;pg=PT222&amp;dq=%22white+poplar%22&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22white%20poplar%22&amp;f=false Priscilla Throop]).&lt;/ref&gt; The association of white poplar leaves with Herakles is also attested by archaeological remains, such as the poplar-leaf motif carved on a statue base found in a small sanctuary to Herakles (Roman [[Hercules]]) along the [[Tiber river]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Zanker, ''The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus'' (University of Michigan Press, 1988, 199), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;David Evans, "Dodona, Dodola, and Daedala," in ''Myth in Indo-European Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1974), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; that behind the vague outlines of this tale lurks an older myth having to do with Herakles' encounter with the river deity [[Achelous]], who had [[chthonic]] associations and whose name was the subject of speculative theological etymology among the Greeks, in this case involving ''acherōïs'', another Greek word for "poplar."  In a [[founding myth]] of the 1st century BC, Herakles is supposed to have established the [[Arverni]]an ''[[oppidum]]'' of [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] 4.19; Nico Roymans, ''Ethnic Identity and Imperial Powers: The Batavians in the Early Roman Empire'' (Amsterdam University Press, 2004), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; the name of which likely derives from the [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] word for poplar.&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Alder," ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997), p. 11; Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrants of the [[Dionysian mysteries|Bacchic rites]] wore a wreath of poplar leaves to honor the chthonic aspect of [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Bernabé and Ana Isabel Jiménez San Cristóbal, ''Instructions for the Netherworld: The Orphic Gold Tablets'' (Brill, 2008), pp. 93 and 125, citing [[Harpocration]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Elis]], white poplar was the only wood used in sacrifices to [[Zeus]], according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], because Herakles imported the tree and used it to burn the thigh bones of sacrificial victims at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. The oak is the customary sacred tree of Zeus, and the substitution among the Eleans may simply reflect the more widespread growth habit of the poplar there.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, "Dodona, Dodola, and Daedala," p. 114, citing [[Arthur Bernard Cook]], "Zeus, Jupiter, and the Oak," ''Classical Review'' 17 (1903), p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; The hero was supposed to have discovered the tree growing on the banks of the upperworld Acheron in [[Thesprotia]].
Pausanias says this is [[aition|the reason]] for the [[Homeric epithet]] ''Acherōïda'' for the white poplar,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''[[Description of Greece]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D14%3Asection%3D2 5.14.2]; ''[[Iliad]]'' 13.389, and 16.482. See also Servius, note to ''Eclogue'' 7.61, on ''Acherōïda'', where the underworld river seems meant. The [[English Renaissance]] poet [[Edmund Spenser]] alludes in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' (Book 2, Canto V, stanza 31) to an association of "Olympick [[Jove]]" and the white poplar instead of his conventional [[oak]].&lt;/ref&gt; which was also called ''leukē'' in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Calvert, ''P. Vergili Maronis. Aeneidos Liber V'' (Cambridge University Press, 1879), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The white poplar might be worn as a crown at athletic contests in honor of Herakles, a patron of the [[ancient Olympic games|Olympic games]]. Its infernal origin made it appropriate for [[funeral games (antiquity)|funeral games]],&lt;ref&gt;Calvert, ''P. Vergili Maronis. Aeneidos Liber V'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; which played an important role in the development of Greek athletics.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Kyle, ''Athletics in Ancient Athens'' (Brill, 1987, 1993), pp. 10–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The white poplar was also sacred to [[Persephone]], for whom Leuce seems to be a doublet, as a goddess of regeneration.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} [[Robert Graves]] used the myth of Leuce in developing his poetic theories of mythology. Graves, for instance, holds that the back of the poplar leaf was turned white by the sweat of Herakles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]], (1955). ''[[The Greek Myths]] I'' (London: Penguin, 1955, revised edition 1960), pp. 121, 124-125, and ''The Greek Myths II'', p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The White Goddess]]'', he names the white poplar as one of the "three trees of resurrection", along with alder and cypress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]], ''The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth'' (New York, 1948, 1975, 1999 printing), p. 171. The basis for Graves' assertion that Herakles bound his head with white poplar after killing [[Cacus]] (p. 193) is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''liquid droplet radiator''' (LDR) or previously termed '''liquid droplet stream radiator''' is a proposed lightweight [[radiator]] for the dissipation of [[waste heat]] generated by [[Nuclear power in space|power plants]], [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] or [[Spacecraft|spacecraft systems]] in space.

==Background==
An advanced or future space mission must have a power source or propulsion that will require the rejection of waste heat.
Disposing large quantities of waste heat must be considered in order to realize a large-space structure (LSS) that handle high power such as a [[Nuclear power in space|nuclear reactor]] or a [[Space-based solar power|space solar power satellite (SPS)]].

However, the required [[Thermal radiation#Radiative power|radiator surface area]] is huge, hence, the system mass is very large. The liquid droplet radiator (LDR) has an advantage in terms of the rejected heat power-weight ratio. The results of the studies indicate that for rejection temperatures below approximately 700&amp;nbsp;K, the LDR system is significantly lighter in weight than the other advanced radiator concepts. A LDR can be seven times lighter than conventional [[Heat pipe#Spacecraft|heat pipe radiators]] of similar size.&lt;ref name="Buckner1987"&gt;

The LDR is more resistant to meteorite impacts due to less critical surface or windage, and requires less storage volume. 
Therefore, the LDR has attracted attention as an advanced radiator for high-power space systems.

In 1978, John M. Hedgepeth proposed, in "Ultralightweight Structures for Space Power," in Radiation Energy Conversion in Space, Vol. 61 of Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics, K. W. Billman, ed. (AIAA, New York, 1978), p.&amp;nbsp;126, 
the use of a dust radiator to reduce the radiator weight of solar power satellites. Practical problems of this dust system led to the LDR concept in 1979.

==Concept==

[[File:Liquid Droplet Radiator concept schematic(animated).svg|thumb|right|200px|general LDR concept mechanics]]

The liquid droplet radiator (LDR) system consists of a droplet generator, a collector, a [[heat exchanger]], a recirculating pump, and a bellows-type pressure regulator ([[Hydraulic accumulator#Metal bellows type|accumulator]]). 
While undergoing a reduction in pressure the [[Boiling point|saturated liquid]] is sprayed into space as coherent streams of tiny, discrete droplets. 
The droplet stream can be a column or a sheet of liquid droplets moving through space from the droplet generator to the collector. 
The droplets carry the waste heat generated by a space power system and radiate this waste heat directly to space during their flight by transient [[Thermal radiation|radiative heat transfer]]. 
The liquid droplets are collected at a lower temperature, reheated, and pumped to the droplet generator and reused to continue to remove waste heat from the thermodynamic power cycle.

The pressure at which liquid droplets are formed can vary widely in different applications, but it was found that once the droplet flow has been established, substantially lower pressures are needed to maintain the flow of droplet streams.&lt;ref name="US4572285"&gt;

==Heat transfer==
Spacecraft waste heat is ultimately rejected to space by radiator surfaces. Radiators can be of different forms, such as spacecraft structural panels, flat-plate radiators mounted to the side of the spacecraft, panels deployed after the spacecraft is on orbit, and droplets. 
All radiators reject heat by [[infrared]] (IR) radiation from their surfaces. The radiating power depends on the surface's emittance and temperature. 
The radiator must reject both the spacecraft waste heat plus any [[Absorption spectroscopy|radiant-heat]] loads from the environment or other spacecraft surfaces.&lt;ref name="Rochus2011"&gt;

 |publisher=Université de Liège }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most radiators are therefore given surface finishes with high IR emittance ({{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;epsilon;&lt;/var&gt;}} &gt; 0.8) to maximize heat rejection and low solar absorption ({{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/var&gt;}} &lt; 0.2) to limit heat loads from the sun. 
High-temperature radiators are preferred for better efficiency and size reduction considerations, however, [[Fluid dynamics|fluid property]] and droplet cloud property are additional factors.
Droplet size formation and droplet density govern emission and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|reabsorption]]. 
A smaller droplet is essential for obtaining effective radiation in the liquid droplet radiator. A droplet with a diameter of 1 μm has been calculated to cool from 500 K to 252 K in two seconds. A dense cloud of the droplet sheet will retard the cooling rate of the droplets because of the reabsorption of the emitted light.&lt;ref name="Ohta1988"&gt;

A single droplet radiates heat as it travels through space and at any time this heat loss is given by:&lt;ref name="Buckner1987"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}= (4 \pi a^2) \sigma F T^4&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]], 
&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}&lt;/math&gt; is the droplet heat loss rate to space (joules/second), 
&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the droplet radius (meters), 
&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the average gray body view factor for droplet at stream center (less than one), and 
&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute droplet temperature at any time ([[kelvin]]).

This equation models the droplet as a gray body with
constant average emissivity. The instantaneous radiation
rate is equal to the rate of energy loss resulting in this
equation:&lt;ref name="Buckner1987"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
(4 \pi a^2 ) \sigma F T^4  =  - c \rho \frac{ 4 \pi a^4 }{ 3 } \frac{ dT }{ dt }
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Heat capacity|specific heat capacity]], 
&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of droplet (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), 
&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the droplet transit time (seconds).

==Limitations, challenges and solutions==
The operating environment is not simply black space, but one with solar radiation and diffuse radiation reflected and emitted from the sun (stars), earth, other objects, and or the ship's own propulsion system. It is possible to "orient" the droplet sheet edge towards an external heat source but the sheet area would still be subject to radiation from other sources. Most of the presented solutions of the equation of radiative transfer are practical simplifications by introducing assumptions.

In order to achieve high collection efficiency splashing of the droplet on the collector surface has to be minimized. It was determined that droplet collector with an incidence angle of 35 degrees can prevent a uniform droplet stream with droplet diameter 250&amp;nbsp;µm and a velocity of 16&amp;nbsp;m/s from splashing under [[Micro-g environment|microgravity]] condition.&lt;ref name="Totani2002"/&gt;
Another solution is to have a liquid film formed on the inner surface of the collector. When the droplet streams are absorbed in this liquid film, no splashes should be formed. A miscapture rate of incoming droplets was required to be less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;. The droplet diameter was determined to be less than 300&amp;nbsp;µm and the droplet speed less than 20&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref name="Hosokawa1993"&gt;

If a [[ferrofluid]] is used a magnetic focusing means can effectively suppress splashing.&lt;ref name="US4572285"/&gt;

As the droplet sheet is in free fall a spacecraft performing a maneuver or angular acceleration would lose coolant. Even a magnetically focused LDR has a very limited tolerance of less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;g.

A droplet generator has approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; holes (orifices) per system with diameters of 50–20&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name="Wallace1991"&gt;

These orifices are more susceptible to damage than a conventional solide radiator or heat pipe which may affect droplet formation and droplet stream flow direction, potentially causing fluid loss.

==Liquids==
Liquids with low vapor pressures are preferred for the working fluids to minimize evaporation loss due to [[flash evaporation]].&lt;ref name="Totani2006"&gt;

Liquids have been found that in the range of 300 to 900 K have a vapor pressure so low that the evaporation loss during the normal lifetime of a space system
(possibly as long as 30 years) will be only a small fraction of the total mass of the radiator.

If a liquid metal is used as the coolant, the pumping of the liquid may use an electromagnetic device. The device induces eddy currents in the metal that generate a [[Lorentz force]] with their associated magnetic fields. The effect is the pumping of the liquid metal resulting in a simplified design with no moving parts. This is known as [[Magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]] pumping.&lt;ref name="Kadid2004"&gt;

For example, a simple mixture of mineral oil and iron filings was found to approximate a suitable ferrofluid for several seconds, before separation of the iron filings and oil was observed in the presence of a magnetic field. At droplet sizes of approximately 200&amp;nbsp;[[µm]], surface tension will hold the two components at accelerations up to about 1 g.&lt;ref name="US4572285"/&gt;

If an [[Ionic liquid|ionic fluid]] is used as the coolant, the fluid can be used for momentum transfer between spacecraft traveling at different speeds. It may be possible to synthesize the fluid in-situ. For example, BMIM-BF4 ( &amp;#91;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#93;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) is 42.5% [[carbon]] by mass. [[Lunar soil|Lunar regolith]] typically contains several compounds with carbon and about 5% of asteroids are carbonaceous [[chondrite]]s which are rich in carbon as well as metals and water. 
It may be possible to mine the moon for carbon and combine it with other elements to produce ionic fluid. Another good source of carbon is [[Mars]]' largest moon, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]], which is a captured asteroid believed to be rich in carbon.&lt;ref name="Joslyn2012"&gt;

==LDR design configurations==
[[File:Liquid Droplet Radiator concept configurations.png|thumb|right|200px|different LDR configurations]]
There are two different droplet collection schemes: the centrifugal approach and the linear collection scheme. The linear collector is considered to be simpler, more reliable and lighter.&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer1989"/&gt;

Several different LDR configurations have been proposed and evaluated.&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer1989"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="White1987"&gt;

*The ''spiral LDR'' employs a generator and collector which rotate at the same angular velocity. This concept was considered more complex due to unnecessary rotation of the collector.&lt;ref name="White1987"/&gt;
*The ''enclosed disc LDR'' contains a droplet generator at the center for creating a disc of droplets. Only the collector rotates. The entire radiator is enclosed by a transparent shroud, which minimizes spacecraft contamination resulting from any errant droplets. This concept was considered more complex due to unnecessary rotation of the collector.&lt;ref name="White1987"/&gt;
*The ''annular LDR'' utilizes a rotating collector to capture an annular sheet of droplets from an annular generator. The annular LDR has an inefficient radiative performance – the sheet radiates to itself more than the droplet sheets of alternate configurations.&lt;ref name="White1987"/&gt;
*Several proposed variations of the LDR utilize electric fields to control droplet trajectories as in the [[Inkjet printing|ink jet printer]]. The Electrostatic THermal (Energy) Radiator (ETHER) is essentially a proposed variation of the LDR. The droplets are charged and in conjunction with a charge on the spacecraft that is opposite the droplet charge, the droplets will execute a slightly elliptical orbit. This closed trajectory would reduce overall system size. This concept calls for concerns about droplet-plasma interactions. Further, in low earth orbit the spacecraft will acquire its own [[space charge|potential]].&lt;ref name="White1987"/&gt;

Rectangular and triangular versions of the LDR have been investigated the most.

*The ''rectangular LDR'' employs a linear collector which is as wide as the droplet generator. The collector can be two sided, where two droplet sheets traveling in opposite directions impact a single collector. An alternate variation would utilize a one sided collector, with only one generator and droplet sheet. In a rectangular LDR, there is no focusing of the droplet sheet, and the droplet number density remains constant along the flight path. It is the simplest LDR design with the largest radiating area.&lt;ref name="White1987"/&gt;
*The ''triangular LDR'' concept employs a droplet generator to form a converging stream array (sheet) of droplets. The collector, located at the convergence point of the droplet sheet, employs a centrifugal force to capture the droplets. The triangular LDR is inherently less massive, because of the smaller collector. System studies have indicated that a triangular LDR can be 40 percent less massive than a rectangular LDR.  However, for any comparable size the triangular LDR has half the area of a rectangular sheet and therefore rejects less heat. Currently, the use of pitot tube pickups has replaced the initial complex rotating seals. Collisions in a focused droplet sheet result in coalescence of the impacting droplets. The triangular LDR is now being developed more extensively.&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="White1987"/&gt;
*The ''magnetically focused LDR'' employs a magnetic field to focus streams of droplets directed from the generator toward the collector, thereby assuring that essentially all of the droplets captured, even though some of the streams may be misdirected as they leave the generator. The magnetic focusing means is also effective to suppress splashing of liquid when the droplets impinge on the collector. The magnetically focused LDR was investigated and patented by the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL) under a grant by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (Contract DE-AC02-76CH00016). The magnetic means can be achieved with a [[Solenoid|toroidal shaped electro-magnet]] or permanent magnets. As only one side of the droplet sheet would be focused by a single permanent magnet, an even number has to be placed across each other adjacent to the collector. A permanent dipole magnet has limited field strength, hence limits radiator size. Electromagnets or (cryogenic cooled) superconducting magnets offer higher field strengths, but may have mass tradeoff. A major conclusion drawn from calculations is that a spacecraft can be maneuvered at accelerations less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; g. Higher accelerations require numerous smaller LDRs which will be more massive in the sum, but would to be more likely to survive.&lt;ref name="US4572285"/&gt;

==Monitoring and maintenance==
System control and 
monitoring by means of artificial 
intelligence could enhance 
autonomous power system 
operation.

==Further research==
The LDR is being studied as a byproduct of a concept using a fluid stream for momentum transfer between an approaching spacecraft and another spacecraft, station or moon base. This method could reduce spacecraft mass while increasing space flight efficiency.&lt;ref name="Buch1986"/&gt;

A ''Liquid Sheet Radiator'' (LRS), adapted for planetary surfaces, is essentially a fountain enclosed in a transparent envelope. The liquid flows down on the inside of this envelope. The liquid sheet radiator concept is exceptionally stable and does not require special machining of the orifice to achieve its performance.&lt;ref name="Brandhorst1999"&gt;

'''Australian herbs and spices''' were used by [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal peoples]] to flavour food in ground ovens. The term "spice" is applied generally to the non-leafy range of strongly flavoured dried Australian [[bushfood]]s. They mainly consist of [[aromatic]] [[fruits]] and seed products although Australian wild peppers also have spicy leaves. There are also a small number of aromatic leaves but unlike culinary herbs from other cultures which often come from small soft-stemmed [[forb]]s, the Australian herb species are generally trees from rainforests, open forests and woodlands.

Australian herbs and spices are generally dried and ground to produce a powdered or flaked spice, either used as single ingredient or in blends. 

They were used to a limited extent by colonists in the 18th and 19th centuries. Some extracts were used as [[flavouring]] during the 20th century. Australian native spices have become more widely recognised and used by non-indigenous people since the early 1980s as part of the bushfood industry, with increasing [[gourmet]] use and export.

They can also be used as a fresh product. Leaves can be used whole, like a bay-leaf in cooking, or spicy fruits are added to various dishes for flavour.

The [[distilled]] essential oils from leaves and twigs are also used as [[flavoring|flavouring]] products.

A '''list of Brazilian National Forests''' follows. According to the Brazilian National System of Conservation Units, a [[National forest (Brazil)|national forest of Brazil]] is an area with forest cover of predominantly native species that has as its basic objective the multiple sustainable use of the forest resources and scientific research, with emphasis on methods of sustainable exploitation of native forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|O que são Unidades de Conservação – ((o))eco}}|language=Portuguese |title=O que são Unidades de Conservação|publisher=((o))eco|date=19 April 2013 |url=http://www.oeco.org.br/dicionario-ambiental/27099-o-que-sao-unidades-de-conservacao/|accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F5 tornado Elie Manitoba 2007.jpg|thumb|Canada's only confirmed F5 tornado, near Elie, Manitoba, 2007]]

This page lists [[tornado]]es and [[tornado outbreak]]s which have touched down in [[Canada]] prior to the [[List of 21st-century Canadian tornadoes and tornado outbreaks|21st century]]. On average, there are around 80 confirmed and unconfirmed tornadoes that touch down in Canada each year, with most occurring in [[Southern Ontario]], the southern [[Canadian Prairies]] and southern [[Quebec]]. Canada ranks as the country with the second most tornadoes per year, after the US. The most common types are F0 to F2 in damage intensity level and usually result in minor structural damage to barns, wood fences, [[roof shingle]]s, chimneys, uprooted or snapped tree limbs and downed power lines. Fewer than 5% of tornadoes in Canada are rated F3 or higher in intensity, where wind speeds are in excess of {{convert|225|km/h|abbr=on}}. Prior to April 1, 2013, Canada used a slightly modified [[Fujita scale]], and as of that date the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]], again slightly modified, was put into use to rate tornado intensity, based on the damage to buildings and vegetation.&lt;ref name="ehfs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=41E875DA-1|title=Environment and Climate Change Canada - Weather and Meteorology - Enhanced Fujita Scale|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|last=Canada|date=|work=ec.gc.ca|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontario]], [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] all average 15 tornadoes per season, followed by Quebec with fewer than 10. [[New Brunswick]] and the [[British Columbia Interior]] are also recognized tornado zones. All other [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] have significantly less threat from tornadoes. The peak season in Canada is in the summer months when clashing air masses move north, as opposed to the spring season in the United States southern-central plains, although tornadoes in Canada have occurred in spring, fall and very rarely winter.

The reported increase in numbers of tornadoes in recent years may reflect more reporting by citizens and media involvement rather than an actual increase in tornado occurrence (although some natural increase has not been ruled out), in addition to better detection technology i.e. [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]] and [[satellite imagery]]. The upswing could also be attributed to other factors, such as improved aerial and ground damage assessment after the fact in sparsely populated areas (particularly the case in remote parts of the Canadian Prairies and [[Northern Ontario]], for example), better trained spotter capabilities and increased use of digital recording devices by citizens. Tornadoes in Canada are enough of a threat for a [[Emergency population warning|public warning system]] to be in place, overseen by the national weather agency, [[Environment and Climate Change Canada|Environment Canada]] (EC).

For a variety of reasons, such as Canada's lower population density and generally stronger housing construction due to the colder climate, Canadian tornadoes have historically caused far fewer fatalities than tornadoes in the United States. The deadliest tornado in Canadian history, the [[Regina Cyclone]] of June 30, 1912, does not even rank in the top 25 when compared to American tornado fatalities. Urban centres are not immune from the threat of severe tornadoes. Nine medium to large size Canadian cities have been hit by significant strength tornadoes (F3 or higher), which caused large-scale damage and fatalities: [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] (1912); [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] (1946 and 1974); [[Sarnia]] (1953); [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] (1970); [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] (1979); [[London, Ontario|London]] (1984); [[Barrie]] (1985); [[Edmonton]] (1987) [[Goderich, Ontario|Goderich]] (2011), Alonsa, Manitoba (2018) and Ottawa-Gatineau (2018). All figures for damages are in [[Canadian dollar]]s.

===1991===
* March 27 - an early season tornado struck [[Sarnia, Ontario]], causing over $25 million in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdd.publicsafety.gc.ca/dtpg-eng.aspx?cultureCode=en-Ca&amp;provinces=9&amp;normalizedCostYear=1&amp;dynamic=false&amp;eventId=129|title=Canadian Disaster Database|first=Public Safety Canada|last=Government of Canada|date=September 13, 2013|work=publicsafety.gc.ca|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* August 27 - an F3 tornado touched down in the [[Mauricie]] region. The town of [[Maskinongé, Quebec|Maskinongé]] was hardest hit among three communities, with 60% of its buildings damaged. Fifteen people were injured and the estimated damage cost was upwards of $25 million.&lt;ref name="publicsafety1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100323171952/http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/res/em/nh/to/to-sig-eng.aspx ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992===
* June 24 - tornadoes, large hail and torrential downpours affected [[southern Manitoba]]. Tennis ball sized hail fell near [[Morden, Manitoba|Morden]] and winds gusting to {{convert|154|km/h|abbr=on}} were recorded at [[Pilot Mound, Manitoba|Pilot Mound]]. There were five confirmed tornado touchdowns and numerous [[funnel cloud]]s in Manitoba that day. There was some very crisp video footage of one rope tornado tearing up farmland near [[Portage la Prairie]]. The region had been affected by severe weather the day before as well.

===1993===
* July 29 - a series of violent thunderstorms tracked across [[Central Alberta]], spawning three tornadoes. The strongest of these was an F3 in [[Holden, Alberta|Holden]], {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} east of Edmonton. An F0 touched down in near [[Falun, Alberta|Falun]], east of [[Pigeon Lake (Alberta)|Pigeon Lake]], and an F1 tornado was reported {{Convert|60|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Lac La Biche, Alberta|Lac La Biche]].

===1994===
* July 9 - one person was killed when an F2 tore through the town of [[Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu, Quebec]]. Three other people were injured, and about a dozen homes were damaged.
* August 4 - an F3 tornado touched down in [[Aylmer, Quebec]] across the river from [[Ottawa]], injuring 15 people. The tornado path was {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} long and caused major damage to a downtown residential subdivision, including homes destroyed. A second tornado had previously touched down just across the [[Ottawa River]] in [[Carp, Ontario|Carp]]. In Quebec, other tornadoes touched down near [[Wentworth-Nord, Quebec|Laurel]] and [[Rawdon, Quebec|Rawdon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030821125801/http://www.criacc.qc.ca/climat/suivi/tornade_f.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aylmer residents on 1994 tornado: 'It is impossible to forget' |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/aylmer-residents-on-1994-tornado-it-is-impossible-to-forget-1.2724238 |website=cbc.ca |publisher=CBC |accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* August 27 - a F4 tornado hit rural farmland near [[Municipality of Killarney-Turtle Mountain|Turtle Mountain, Manitoba]]. Devastation was especially visible at Mayfair [[Hutterite]] Colony, and there was well over $1 million in damage. There were no injuries or deaths.

===1995===
* June 20 - thunderstorms rumbled for seven hours over Manitoba, producing {{convert|90|km/h|abbr=on}} winds which blew trees and power lines over. The storm produced a weak tornado.
* July 15 - a large progressive [[derecho]] thunderstorm produced severe winds over an expansive area of the central [[Great Lakes]] and [[New England]] overnight. It also contained at least six tornadoes that hit [[Central Ontario]], most centred on or to the north of the [[Kawartha Lakes (Ontario)|Kawartha Lakes]]. The strongest was an F2 tornado that destroyed a marina at [[Selwyn, Ontario|Bridgenorth]] and overturned a houseboat on [[Lake Chemong]], trapping 20 occupants for a few hours until they were rescued, just north of [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]]. One person was killed in Bridgenorth.
* July 26 - a tornado in [[Fredericton, New Brunswick]] took the roof off a government building and damaged a tennis court dome.
* August 14 - a tornado touched down near [[Barrie, Ontario]].
* August 29 - several farms were destroyed when a tornado lasting a couple of minutes affected [[Spring Valley, Saskatchewan]], near [[Moose Jaw]].

===1996===
* April 20 - [[1996 Southern Ontario tornadoes|Multiple tornadoes]] hit [[Grey County|Grey]], [[Wellington County, Ontario|Wellington]] and [[Dufferin County|Dufferin]] counties. Two F3 class tornadoes touched down in Grey County ([[Williamsford, Ontario|Williamsford]]), Wellington County and Dufferin County. Significant property damage occurred; nine people were injured by the two tornadoes.
* May 20 - a strong thunderstorm damaged one of the four screens of a drive-in theatre at [[Thorold, Ontario]] in the [[Regional Municipality of Niagara|Niagara Region]]. Coincidentally, this drive-in was planning to show the movie ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' that evening. Eyewitnesses reported seeing a small funnel cloud, but the physical evidence was inconclusive. Distorted and exaggerated media reports of this event abound; most claimed that the storm blew down the screen while ''Twister'' was being shown on it. The storm actually took place before sundown. However, a small tornado did touch down in [[Stoney Creek, Ontario|Stoney Creek]] that same evening.
* July 4 - an estimated nine tornadoes touched down in the [[Saskatoon]], [[Maymont, Saskatchewan|Maymont]] and [[Osler, Saskatchewan]] areas. An F3 was measured in the Maymont area, destroying power lines. Homes and property were damaged in the Osler area. Wind gusts in Saskatoon reached {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|141|km/h|abbr=on}}, damaging many trees and properties on the east end of the city. A drive-in theatre and a nightclub on the eastern outskirts of the city were also heavily damaged; the movie that was going to be shown at the drive-in that night was ''Twister''.

===1997===
* June 24 - [[Lantz, Nova Scotia]], F0 tornado touched down in a local ball field at approximately 4:45&amp;nbsp;pm [[Atlantic Time Zone|ADT]] ([[UTC−03:00]]). Golf ball sized hail and intense lightning were also reported with this storm.
* July 2 - [[1997 Southeast Michigan tornado outbreak|Southeast Michigan tornado outbreak]] in F1, F2, F3 [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and surrounding areas. See article for more in-depth information.
* July 4 - an F2 tornado touched down near [[Grand Falls, New Brunswick]]. A roof was torn off a building, and farmers' fields were ripped up. The same line of storms also dropped an F2 tornado in [[Matapédia, Quebec|Matapédia]] (New Brunswick/Quebec border), where a couple of barns were destroyed.

===1998===
* June 2 - during a wider severe weather outbreak ([[Derecho|derecho thunderstorm]]) that struck [[Southern Ontario]] in the mid-afternoon, an F1 tornado descended near Holbrook around 3:50&amp;nbsp;pm EDT (UTC−04:00) and travelled southeastward to [[Norwich, Ontario|Norwich]], damaging many buildings, including a church. There were also tornado reports in [[Elmvale, Ontario|Elmvale]] and [[Dunnville, Ontario|Dunnville]], and several reports of funnel clouds, hail, and high winds.
* July 10 - an F2 tornado touched down in Charleston, New Brunswick, leaving a {{convert|90|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}} path of damage. A mobile home was thrown {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} and totally destroyed. There were minor injuries to the residents in the home.
* July 19 - a weak tornado hit [[Daysland, Alberta]], about {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Camrose, Alberta|Camrose]]. It damaged power lines, knocking out power to surrounding communities.
* August 11 - a small F1 tornado went through part of [[Saint-Émile, Quebec City]], in the suburbs of [[Quebec City]]. It overturned a shed and caused a citywide electricity loss when a garage was slammed into an electric pole.

===1999===
* May 8 - a tornado over [[Hull, Quebec]] caused $2M damage and tore roofs off buildings. It was caused by the same system that produced the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]] between May 3 and May 8. It was the second significant tornado in the [[Gatineau|Hull-Gatineau]] area in five years.
* May 18 - three tornadoes touched down close to the western limits of [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]]. The supercell associated with the tornadoes pelted the city with quarter-sized hail, wind gusts of nearly {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}}, and over {{convert|2|in|abbr=on|order=flip}} of rain fell from the half-hour storm.
* July 6 - a [[Centre-du-Québec|Bois-Francs, Quebec]] region tornado left 4,000 without power and 200 in need of temporary shelter in [[Berthierville]], [[Yamaska, Quebec|Yamaska]] and [[Drummondville]]. Environment Canada records show one person was killed in the event.&lt;ref name="publicsafety1"/&gt;
* August 4 - an F2 tornado with a twisting but narrow path caused damage in the rural north end of [[Burlington, Ontario]], relocating a [[motorhome]] {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} from where it was parked. The tornado track was over {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} long.
* August 18 - a small tornado struck [[Pugwash, Nova Scotia]], causing some localized structural damage. There were no serious injuries.

*July 17 - three tornadoes were confirmed in [[Ontario]] after several [[supercell]] thunderstorms developed over the province. An F2 tornado formed over the city of [[Guelph]], lasting approximately 23 minutes and leaving a path of damage {{convert|13|km|abbr=on}} long. Damage was estimated at over $2 million and one minor injury was reported. The same storm also produced a second, unrated tornado near [[Waterdown, Ontario|Waterdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/pat/research/dsills/surveys/17Jul00/Guelph/survey.html|title=17 July 2000 - Storm Damage Survey|first=David|last=Sills|date=|work=yorku.ca|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third tornado, an F1, occurred in [[Simcoe County]], near the town of [[Tay, Ontario|Melduf]].

}}
The genus ''Plasmodium'' is a member of the order [[Haemosporidia]]. It is the largest genus within this order and currently consists of over 250 species. They cause [[malaria]] in many different [[vertebrates]].

The species in this genus are entirely [[parasitic]] with part of their life cycle spent in a vertebrate host and another in an invertebrate host - usually a [[mosquito]]. Vertebrates infected by members of this genus include mammals, birds and reptiles.

Host range among the mammalian orders is non uniform. At least 29 species infect non human [[primates]]; [[rodents]] outside the tropical parts of [[Africa]] are rarely affected; a few species are known to infect [[bat]]s, [[porcupine]]s and [[squirrel]]s; [[carnivore]]s, [[insectivore]]s and [[marsupial]]s are not known to act as hosts.

The listing of host species among the reptiles has rarely been attempted. Ayala in 1978 listed 156 published accounts on 54 valid species and subspecies between 1909 and 1975.&lt;ref name="Ayala1978"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1550-7408.1978.tb03874.x | author = Ayala S.C. | year = 1978 | title = Checklist, host index, and annotated bibliography of ''Plasmodium'' from reptiles | url = | journal = J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 87–100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional breakdown was Africa: 30 reports on 9 species; [[Australia]], [[Asia]] &amp; [[Oceania]]: 12 reports on 6 species and 2 subspecies; [[Americas]]: 116 reports on 37 species.

==Diagnostic criteria of the order Haemosporida==
Currently there are ~550 species recognised in this order organised into 17 genera.&lt;ref name=Schaer2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1311016110 |pmid=24101466 |pmc=3808598 |title=High diversity of West African bat malaria parasites and a tight link with rodent Plasmodium taxa |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=110 |issue=43 |pages=17415–9 |year=2013 |last1=Schaer |first1=J |last2=Perkins |first2=S. L |last3=Decher |first3=J |last4=Leendertz |first4=F. H |last5=Fahr |first5=J |last6=Weber |first6=N |last7=Matuschewski |first7=K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diagnostic criteria of this family are:

* [[macrogamete]]s and [[microgamont]]s develop independently
* [[Syzygy (biology)|syzygy]] is absent
* [[microgametocyte]] produces 8 flagellated [[microgamete]]s
* [[zygote]] is motile (known as an [[ookinete]])
* [[conoid]] present in ookinete stage only
* [[sporozoites]] naked in [[oocyst]] (that is without a sporocyst)
* heteroxenous: [[Protozoal merogony|merogony]] and [[gamogony]] occur in [[vertebrate]] host and fertilization and [[sporogony]] in definitive host (a blood sucking [[insect]])
* [[hemozoin]] pigment produced in some genera (including ''Plasmodium'')

==Diagnostic criteria of the genus ''Plasmodium''==
* [[Protozoal merogony|Merogony]] occurs both in [[erythrocyte]]s and other tissues
* [[Merozoite]]s, [[schizont]]s or [[gametocyte]]s can be seen within erythrocytes and may displace the host nucleus
* Merozoites have a "signet-ring" appearance due to a large vacuole that forces the parasite’s nucleus to one pole
* Schizonts are round to oval inclusions that contain the deeply staining merozoites
* Forms gamonts in erythrocytes
* Gametocytes are 'halter-shaped' similar to ''[[Haemoproteus]]'' but the pigment granules are more confined
* [[Hemozoin]] is present
* [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector]]s are either [[mosquito]]es or sandflies (''[[Lutzomyia]]'').
* [[Vertebrate]] hosts include [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s and [[reptile]]s

===Note===
Mammalian erythrocytes do not possess a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. Although it has been suggested that the nucleus was lost in the erythrocytes better to enable them to traverse capillaries evidence for this is lacking. It appears that this loss along with the mitochondria that the erythrocytes also lose may protect the erythrocytes against oxidative stress.&lt;ref name=Zhang2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/iub.490 |pmid=21698761 |title=Red blood cell extrudes nucleus and mitochondria against oxidative stress |journal=IUBMB Life |volume=63 |issue=7 |pages=560–5 |year=2011 |last1=Zhang |first1=Zhong-Wei |last2=Cheng |first2=Jian |last3=Xu |first3=Fei |last4=Chen |first4=Yang-Er |last5=Du |first5=Jun-Bo |last6=Yuan |first6=Ming |last7=Zhu |first7=Feng |last8=Xu |first8=Xiao-Chao |last9=Yuan |first9=Shu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgenera==
The full taxonomic name of a species includes the subgenus but this is often omitted in practice. The full name indicates some features of the morphology and type of host species. Sixteen subgenera are currently recognised.

The avian species were discovered soon after the description of ''P. falciparum'' and a variety of generic names were created. These were subsequently placed into the genus ''Plasmodium'' although some workers continued to use the genera ''Laverinia'' and ''[[Proteosoma]]'' for ''P. falciparum'' and the avian species respectively.

The 5th and 6th Congresses of Malaria held at [[Istanbul]] (1953) and [[Lisbon]] (1958) respectively recommended the creation and use of subgenera in this genus. ''Laverinia'' was applied to the species infecting humans and ''Haemamoeba'' to those infecting lizards and birds. This proposal was not universally accepted. Bray in 1955 proposed a definition for the subgenus ''Plasmodium'' and a second for the subgenus ''Laverinia'' in 1958. Garnham described a third subgenus - ''Vinckeia'' - in 1964.

In 1963 Corradetti, Garnham and Laird proposed  a new classification of the avian malaria parasites. They created four sub-genera - ''Giovannolaia'', ''Haemamoeba'', ''Huffia'' and ''Novyella'' - based on the size of the schizonts, the gametocyte forms and the type of exo-erythrocytic schizogony.

Additional subgenera have been created since.

The currently recognised subgenera are listed below.

The current classification scheme was developed prior to the widespread use of DNA sequence based taxonomy and is based on host and morphological criteria. ''Plasmodium'' has since been shown to be paraphytic with the genera ''[[Haemoproteus]]'' and ''[[Hepatocystis]]'' (''vide infra'').&lt;ref name="Santiago-Alarcon2010"/&gt; Revision of this genus will be undertaken once sufficient DNA sequence material is available.

This forthcoming reclassification project is not unique to this genus as DNA based taxonomy is revising many traditional groupings of protozoa.

The bird infecting taxa can be separated into two groups on the basis of the gametocytes: species with round gametocytes
(''Bennettinia'', ''Haemamoeba'') and species with elongated gametocytes (''Giovanniola'', ''Huffia'' and ''Novyella''). The monophyly of the ''Bennettinia'', ''Haemamoeba'' and ''Huffia'' subgenera was subsequently confirmed by molecular studies.&lt;ref name=Martinsen2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0031182006001922 |pmid=17147839 |title=Morphologically defined subgenera of Plasmodium from avian hosts: Test of monophyly by phylogenetic analysis of two mitochondrial genes |journal=Parasitology |volume=134 |issue=4 |pages=483–90 |year=2006 |last1=Martinsen |first1=E. S |last2=Waite |first2=J. L |last3=Schall |first3=J. J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two genera were found to be paraphytic. The genera were then revised and a new subgenus - ''Papernaia'' - was created.&lt;ref name=Landau2010/&gt;

===Species with mammalian hosts===
''[[Laverania]]''

Species in this subgenus infect higher primates (including man) and have characteristic sickle shaped female gametocytes.

The type species is ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''.

''[[Plasmodium]]''

Species infecting higher primates other than those in the subgenus ''Laverania'' are placed in the subgenus ''Plasmodium''.

The type species is ''[[Plasmodium malariae]]''.

''[[Vinckeia]]''

Parasites infecting other mammals including lower [[primate]]s ([[lemur]]s and others) are classified in the subgenus ''Vinckeia''.

The type species is ''[[Plasmodium bubalis]]''.

===Species with avian hosts===
''[[Bennettinia]]''

Schizonts contain scant cytoplasm, are often round, do not exceed the size of the host nucleus and stick to it. Gametocytes, while varying in shape tend to be round or oval, do not exceed the size of the nucleus and stick to it.

The type species is ''[[Plasmodium juxtanucleare]]''.

''[[Giovannolaia]]''

Schizonts contain plentiful cytoplasm, are larger than the host cell nucleus and frequently displace it. They are found only in mature erythrocytes. Gametocytes are elongated. Exoerythrocytic schizogony occurs in the mononuclear phagocyte system.

The type species is ''[[Plasmodium circumflexum]]''.

''[[Haemamoeba]]''

Mature schizonts are larger than the host cell nucleus and commonly displace it. Gametocytes are large, round, oval or irregular in shape and are substantially larger than the host nucleus.

The type species is ''[[Plasmodium relictum]]''.

''[[Huffia]]''

Mature schizonts, while varying in shape and size, contain plentiful cytoplasm and are commonly found in immature erythryocytes. Gametocytes are elongated.

The type species is ''[[Plasmodium elongatum]]''.

''[[Novyella]]''

Mature schizonts are either smaller than or only slightly larger than the host nucleus. They contain scanty [[cytoplasm]]. Gametocytes are elongated. Sexual stages in this subgenus resemble those of ''[[Haemoproteus]]''.  A white/blue globule is present in the cytoplasm. Exoerythrocytic schizogony occurs in the [[mononuclear]] [[phagocyte]] system

The type species is ''[[Plasmodium vaughani]]''.

''[[Papernaia]]''

The gametocytes are elongated. The schizonts apically or lateroapically placed and are rounded or irregularly shaped. The host nucleus may be tilted.

The type species is ''[[Plasmodium polare]]''

===Species with reptilian hosts===
Although over 3200 species of lizard have been identified as hosts to ''Plasmodium'' species, only 29 species of snakes have been. All snake infecting species are placed into the subgenus ''Ophidiella''.

''[[Asiamoeba]]''

The schizonts and gametocytes are greatly disparate in size (4 to 15 times).

''[[Carinamoeba]]''

The schizonts are small and give rise to 8 or fewer merozoites. The gametocytes like the schizonts are small.

The type species is ''[[Plasmodium minasense]]''.

''[[Lacertaemoba]]''

The schizonts are medium-sized and undergo 3 to 5 nuclear divisions. The gametocytes are medium-sized

''[[Paraplasmodium]]''

The schizonts are of medium size. Exoerythrocytic schizonts may be produced in both fixed and wandering host cells. The gametocytes are large. One species in this sub-genus is capable of merogony in a vector of the ''[[Lutzomyia]]'' genus.

''[[Sauramoeba]]''

Large schizonts giving rise to 12 or more merozoites. The gametocytes like the schizonts are large.
The asexual stages tend to disappear from the lymphocytes once the gametocytes appear in the lymphocytes. 
 
The type species is ''[[Plasmodium agamae]]''.

''[[Ophidiella]]''

The species in this subgenus infect only [[snake]]s.

The type species is ''[[Plasmodium weyoni]]''.

===Species with unknown hosts===
One species has been identified from [[Dominica]]n amber - ''[[Plasmodium dominicum]]''.  The vertebrate host of this species is unknown but it seems likely that it may have been a bird.

''[[Nyssorhynchus]]''

The type species is ''[[Plasmodium dominicum]]''.

==Phylogenetics==
Although the evolution of this genus has been studied by a number of authors, details are still being elucidated. A brief summary of the pattern that has emerged is as follows:

The most basal split in the genus is between the reptile/bird species and the mammalian species. The bird/reptile clade appears to be related to the genera ''[[Haemoproteus]]'', ''[[Leukocytozoon]]'' and ''[[Polychromophilus]]''. The genus ''[[Hepatocystis]]'' appears to have evolved from with the mammalian species clade. Within the mammalian species the subgenus ''Laverinia'' appears to be basal with the subgenus ''Plasmodium'' and the rodent species being sister clades.  ''Hepatocystis'' appears to have diverged after the separation of the rodent species. The species infecting lemurs may belong in the subgenus ''Plasmodium'' instead of their current placement within the subgenus ''Vinckeia''.

Within the subgenus ''Plasmodium'', ''P. vivax'' groups with an Asian clade which appears to be rooted in Africa. ''P. malaria'' and ''P. ovale'' both belong to an African clade and are more closely related to each other than to ''P. vivax''. Within the subgenus ''Laverinia'' P. falciparum and ''P. reichenowi'' form a clade while the other four known species form a second clade.

There are a number of additional species in these taxa that await full description so changes to the branching order are likely. However the overall arrangement outlined above seems to be supported by a number of studies by different authors and is unlikely to change. Given the recently recognised paraphytic nature of several of the taxa above, the introduction of new genera and possibly families in the near future seems highly likely.

===Relations with other Haemosporidian genera===

While most phylogenetic trees have tended to agree that ''Plasmodium'' has descended from ''Leukocytozoon'' or ''Haemoproteus'' like species a Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that ''Plasmodium'' may be the ancestral genus that has given rise to ''Haemoproteus'' and other genera.&lt;ref name=Outlaw2011/&gt; Further study in this area is required.

Another Bayesian analysis has suggested the following taxonomy: Mammalian ''Plasmodium'' and ''Hepatocystis'' are sister clades with ''Hepatocystis'' having evolved from within the genus ''Plasmodium''; the bird and reptile species are intermixed and basal to the mammalian ''Plasmodium''/''Hepatocystis'' species; the reptilian/bird ''Plasmodium'' species are a sister clade to the genus ''[[Polychromophilus]]''; ''[[Leukocytozoon]]'' and ''[[Haemoproteus]]'' and sister clades; the ''Leukocytozoon''/''Haemoproteus'' clade is a sister to the ''[[Haemoproteus|Parahaemoproteus]]'' clade; and the ''Parahaemoproteus''/''Haemoproteus''/''Leukocytozoon'' clade is a sister to the reptilian/bird ''Plasmodium''/''Polychromophilus'' clade.&lt;ref name=Outlaw2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1109153108 |pmid=21730128 |pmc=3156215 |title=Rerooting the evolutionary tree of malaria parasites |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=108 |issue=32 |pages=13183–7 |year=2011 |last1=Outlaw |first1=Diana C |last2=Ricklefs |first2=Robert E }}&lt;/ref&gt; This grouping is supported by previous results.&lt;ref name=Perkins2002&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1645/0022-3395(2002)088[0972:AMPOMP]2.0.CO;2 |pmid=12435139 |year=2002 |volume=88 |issue=5 |pages=972–8 |journal=Journal of Parasitology |last1=Perkins |first1=Susan L |title=A molecular phylogeny of malarial parasites recovered from cytochrome b gene sequences |last2=Schall |first2=Josj }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of DNA sequences suggests that the genus is paraphytic with ''[[Hepatocystis]]'' being related to the mammalian species and ''[[Polychromophilus]]'' being related to the reptile species.&lt;ref name=Witsenburg2012&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-11-53 |pmid=22356874 |pmc=3342143 |title=The evolutionary host switches of Polychromophilus: A multi-gene phylogeny of the bat malaria genus suggests a second invasion of mammals by a haemosporidian parasite |journal=Malaria Journal |volume=11 |pages=53 |year=2012 |last1=Witsenburg |first1=Fardo |last2=Salamin |first2=Nicolas |last3=Christe |first3=Philippe }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also supports the ancestor of ''Plasmodium'' being a ''[[Leucocytozoon]]'' like species and that ''Plasmodium'' is more closely related to the ''[[Haemoproteus]]'' - specifically the subgenus ''[[Haemoproteus|Parahaemoproteus]]'' - than to ''Leucocytozoon''.

A paper by Blanquart and Gascuel&lt;ref name="Blanquart2011"&gt;Blanquart S, Gascuel O (2011) Mitochondrial genes support a common origin of rodent malaria parasites and ''Plasmodium falciparum''s relatives infecting great apes. BMC Evol Biol 11(1):70&lt;/ref&gt; examined ''Plasmodium'' 84 mitochondrial sequences and included ''[[Hepatocystis]]'', ''[[Haemoproteus]]'' and ''[[Leukocytozoon]]'' sequences. The results agree with the previous analyses showing that ''Hepatocystis'', ''Haemoproteus'' and ''Plasmodium'' appear to be derived from a ''Leukocytozoon'' ancestor. ''Hepatocystis'' appears to be a sister group to the great ape-rodent clade with the lower primate clade being ancestral to all three. In terms of ''Plasmodium'' subgenera they suggest that the subgenus ''[[Plasmodium]]'' is ancestral to both ''[[Laverania]]'' and ''[[Vinckeia]]''.

A study of parasites infecting bats found that the bats were infected by species of the genera ''Hepatocystis'', ''Plasmodium'', ''Polychomophilus'' and ''Nycteria''.&lt;ref name="Schaer2013"/&gt; A phylogenetic tree which included these genera along with ''Haemoproteus'' and ''Leukocytozoon'' species was examined. As before ''Leukocytozoon'' was basal in this tree. The next clade to diverge was that of the ''Haemoproteus'' species. The remaining genera lay within the currently established genus ''Plasmodium''. The authors suggested that the origin of the ''Plasmodium''/''Hepatocystis'' clade was likely to have been in Africa.

Within this genus the first to diverge were the avian and reptile species. The next clade to diverge was that of the ''Polychomophilus'' species. This was followed in branching order by the ''Nycteria'' species. The subgenus ''Laverinia'' was the next to diverge followed by the subgenus ''Vinckeia''. The crown of the tree was formed by the subgenus ''Plasmodium'' and the genus ''Hepatocytis''. This tree did not support the inclusion of ''P. ovale'' in the subgenus ''Vinckeia'' but agreed with previous analyses suggesting that ''P. malaria'' is more closely related to the Asian clade than ''P. ovale'' is. Several of the bat infecting ''Plasmodium'' species appear to be related to the rodent species.

Bats appear to have evolved ~{{Ma|66}} in Africa&lt;ref name=Eick2005&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msi180 |pmid=15930153 |title=A Nuclear DNA Phylogenetic Perspective on the Evolution of Echolocation and Historical Biogeography of Extant Bats (Chiroptera) |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=1869–86 |year=2005 |last1=Eick |first1=Geeta N |last2=Jacobs |first2=David S |last3=Matthee |first3=Conrad A }}&lt;/ref&gt; which - assuming that the phylogenetic tree in Schaer ''et al'' is correct - places an upper limit on the date for the evolution of the mammalian species of ''Plasmodium''.

Another study of the genera ''Leucocytozoon'', ''Haemoproteus'', ''Parahaemoproteus'', ''Polychromophilus'' and ''Plasmodium'' found that ''Leucocytozoon'' occupied a basal position and that ''Polychromophilus'' and ''Plasmodium'' were sister clades.&lt;ref name=Borner2015&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2015.09.003 |pmid=26364971 |title=Phylogeny of haemosporidian blood parasites revealed by a multi-gene approach |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=94 |issue=Pt A |pages=221–31 |year=2016 |last1=Borner |first1=Janus |last2=Pick |first2=Christian |last3=Thiede |first3=Jenny |last4=Kolawole |first4=Olatunji Matthew |last5=Kingsley |first5=Manchang Tanyi |last6=Schulze |first6=Jana |last7=Cottontail |first7=Veronika M |last8=Wellinghausen |first8=Nele |last9=Schmidt-Chanasit |first9=Jonas |last10=Bruchhaus |first10=Iris |last11=Burmester |first11=Thorsten }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of ''Polychromophilus'' species found that this genus lies within the avian/reptile clade of ''Plasmodium'' species.&lt;ref name=Witsenburg2012/&gt;

A study of mitochondrial, plastid and nuclear genes of the species ''Plasmodium odocoilei'' suggests that this species is actually two species that dierged between {{ma|2.3}} and {{ma|6.0}}.&lt;ref name=Martinsen2016&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501486 |pmid=26989785 |pmc=4788485 |title=Hidden in plain sight: Cryptic and endemic malaria parasites in North American white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) |journal=Science Advances |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=e1501486 |year=2016 |last1=Martinsen |first1=Ellen S |last2=McInerney |first2=Nancy |last3=Brightman |first3=Heidi |last4=Ferebee |first4=Ken |last5=Walsh |first5=Tim |last6=McShea |first6=William J |last7=Forrester |first7=Tavis D |last8=Ware |first8=Lisa |last9=Joyner |first9=Priscilla H |last10=Perkins |first10=Susan L |last11=Latch |first11=Emily K |last12=Yabsley |first12=Michael J |last13=Schall |first13=Joseph J |last14=Fleischer |first14=Robert C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phyogenetic tree suggests that the genus ''[[Nycteria]]'' belongs in a clade that contains the lizard and bird species, that ''Polychromophilus'' form a clade with ''P. odocoilei'' and that ''[[Hepatocystis]]'' species in bats forms a clade with the primate and rodent species. It also suggests that the closest relation to ''Plasmodium'' - other than ''Nycteria'',  ''Polychromophilus'' and ''Hepatocystis'' - is the subgenus ''[[Haemoproteus|Parahaemaproteus]]'' and that this sugbenus is more closed related to ''Plasmodium'' that to the genus ''[[Haemoproteus]]''. This study suggests that the subgenus ''Vinkeia'' is now in need of revision.

Another paper suggests the transfer of the ancestor of ''Plasmodium'' from lizards to bats without passage via birds.&lt;ref name=Lutz2016&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2016.03.004 |pmid=26975691 |title=Diverse sampling of East African haemosporidians reveals chiropteran origin of malaria parasites in primates and rodents |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=99 |pages=7–15 |year=2016 |last1=Lutz |first1=Holly L |last2=Patterson |first2=Bruce D |last3=Kerbis Peterhans |first3=Julian C |last4=Stanley |first4=William T |last5=Webala |first5=Paul W |last6=Gnoske |first6=Thomas P |last7=Hackett |first7=Shannon J |last8=Stanhope |first8=Michael J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of ''Nycteria'' suggests that ''Leukocytozoon'' is basal, followed by ''Heamoproteus''.&lt;ref name=Schaer2015&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2015.01.008 |pmid=25765623 |title=Nycteria parasites of Afrotropical insectivorous bats |journal=International Journal for Parasitology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=375–84 |year=2015 |last1=Schaer |first1=Juliane |last2=Reeder |first2=Deeann M |last3=Vodzak |first3=Megan E |last4=Olival |first4=Kevin J |last5=Weber |first5=Natalie |last6=Mayer |first6=Frieder |last7=Matuschewski |first7=Kai |last8=Perkins |first8=Susan L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sister group to ''Plasmodium''/''Nycteria''/''Polychromophilus''/''Hepatocystis'' is ''Paraheamaproteus''. ''Hepatocystis'' appears to be a derived clade arising from with the subgenus ''Plasmodium''. ''Polychromophilius'' is more closely related to the bird/lizard group than to the mammal infecting species. ''Nycteria'' is the sister taxon to the genus ''Plasmodium''.

The genome of ''[[Haemoproteus tartakovskyi]]'' has been sequenced.&lt;ref name=Bensch2016&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/gbe/evw081 |pmid=27190205 |pmc=4898798 |title=The Genome of ''Haemoproteus'' tartakovskyiand Its Relationship to Human Malaria Parasites |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=1361–73 |year=2016 |last1=Bensch |first1=Staffan |last2=Canbäck |first2=Björn |last3=Debarry |first3=Jeremy D |last4=Johansson |first4=Tomas |last5=Hellgren |first5=Olof |last6=Kissinger |first6=Jessica C |last7=Palinauskas |first7=Vaidas |last8=Videvall |first8=Elin |last9=Valkiūnas |first9=Gediminas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its genome (23.2 megabases) is similar in size to those of ''Plasmodium''. Its GC content is 25.4% which is closer to that of ''P. falciparum'' (19.3%) than to ''P. vivax'' (42.3%). Phylogenetic analyses place it as basal to ''Plasmodium'' species. Its inclusion in a phylogenetic tree suggests that the mammalian species are monophytic.

A study of 114 mitochondrial genomes from species belonging to four genera - ''[[Haemoproteus]]'', ''[[Hepatocystis]]'', ''[[Leucocytozoon]]'' and ''Plasmodium'' - has shown that like ''Plasmodium'', ''Leucocytozoon'' and ''Haemoproteus'' are not monophyletic taxa.&lt;ref name=Andreína2017&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msx285 |pmid=29126122 |pmc=5850713 |title=Mode and Rate of Evolution of Haemosporidian Mitochondrial Genomes: Timing the Radiation of Avian Parasites |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=383–403 |year=2018 |last1=Pacheco |first1=M Andreína |last2=Matta |first2=Nubia E |last3=Valkiūnas |first3=Gediminas |last4=Parker |first4=Patricia G |last5=Mello |first5=Beatriz |last6=Stanley |first6=Craig E |last7=Lentino |first7=Miguel |last8=Garcia-Amado |first8=Maria Alexandra |last9=Cranfield |first9=Michael |last10=Kosakovsky Pond |first10=Sergei L |last11=Escalante |first11=Ananias A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated times of the divergence of these genera was after the [[Cretaceous]]-[[Paleogene]] boundary (about {{Mya|66}}) and coincided with the evolution of the extant avian orders.

The presence of ''[[Plasmodium dominicana]]'' and the related species ''[[Vetufebrus|Vetufebrus ovatus]]'' in Dominican [[amber]] suggests that this genus was present after the [[Cretaceous]]-[[Paleogene]] boundary (about {{Mya|66}}).&lt;ref name="Poinar2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11230-004-6354-6 |pmid=15928991 |title=''Plasmodium dominicana'' n. sp.

Another study found that ''Haemoproteus'' consists of two taxa and that the genus ''Plasmodium'' is paraphyletic with respect to ''Hepatocystis''.&lt;ref name=Martinsen2008/&gt; The same study also found that ''Plasmodium'' species of mammals form a well supported clade and this clade was associated with specialization to ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito vectors. The ''Plasmodium'' of birds and squamate reptiles all fall within a single clade with evidence for repeated switching between birds and squamate hosts.

One study using Bayesian factors to identify the root of the phylogenetic tree has suggested that ''Plasmodium'' may be basal to ''Haemoproteus'', ''Leucocytozoon'', ''Paraheamoproteus'' and ''Polychromophilus''.&lt;ref name=Outlaw2011/&gt; This tree also grouped ''Hepatocystis'' with ''Plasmodium''.

''Rayella'' is thought to have originated from ''Hepatocystis''.&lt;ref name="Witsenburg2012"/&gt;

====Possible evolution====

The evidence suggests the following evolutionary scenario: ''Plasmodium'' evolved from a ''Leucocystis'' like ancestor. This ancestor gave rise to the subgenus ''Parahaemoproteus''. Both of these taxons infect birds. ''Plasmodium'' evolved from its ''Parahaemoproteus'' ancestor when it gained the ability to infect lizards. After this ''Plasmodium'' diverged into a mammal infecting clade and a bird/lizard infecting clade. Within the bird/lizard clade some species developed the ability to infect bats (''Nycteria''). Within the mammalian clade a number of species have also developed the ability to infect bats (''Hepatocystis''). Since ''Haemoproteus'' evolved after the evolution of birds this would suggest that an upper limit for the evolution of this genus is approximately {{ma|66}}. The ''[[Columbidae]]'' - hosts of the ''Haemoproteus'' species - evolved in South East Asia. It is possible that this also was the origin of the genus ''Haemoproteus''.

This upper limit may be further reduced. The genus ''Leucocytozoon'' is thought to have evolved in the [[Oligocene]].&lt;ref name="Bennett1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = GF | year = 1993 | title = Phylogenetic distribution and possible evolution of the avian species of the ''Haemoproteidae'' | url = | journal =  Systematic Parasitology| volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 39–44 | doi=10.1007/bf00009646}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would place an upper limit of {{ma|33.9}} for the evolution of the genus ''Leucocytozoon''.

===Relations with non Haemosporidian genera===

The [[Piroplasma]] are usually considered to be the closest relations to the Haemosporidians.

A molecular Bayesian study of ''[[Babesia]]'' and ''[[Theileria]]'' species along with ''Plasmodium'' species suggests that ''Babesia'' and ''Theileria'' are sister clades and that they diverged from ''Plasmodium'' ~{{Ma|56.5}} (95% credible interval: {{Ma|86.9}} - {{Ma|28.2}})&lt;ref name=Gou2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ece3.685 |pmid=24101988 |pmc=3790545 |title=Coevolutionary analyses of the relationships between piroplasmids and their hard tick hosts |journal=Ecology and Evolution |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=2985–93 |year=2013 |last1=Gou |first1=Huitian |last2=Guan |first2=Guiquan |last3=Liu |first3=Aihong |last4=Ma |first4=Miling |last5=Chen |first5=Ze |last6=Liu |first6=Zhijie |last7=Ren |first7=Qiaoyun |last8=Li |first8=Youquan |last9=Yang |first9=Jifei |last10=Yin |first10=Hong |last11=Luo |first11=Jianxun }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dating in this study used a date of {{Ma|12.5}} for the origin of the genus ''Plasmodium''.&lt;ref name=Ricklefs2010/&gt; The authors also estimated that ''Theileria'' evolved {{Ma|23.38}} (95% credible interval {{Ma|11.1}} – {{Ma|36.7}}) and that ''Babesia'' evolved {{Ma|25.7}} (95% credible interval {{Ma|12.8}}–{{Ma|40.7}})

From these trees it is clear that:

* The trees are consistent with the origin of ''Plasmodium'' from ''Leukocytozoon''
* The genus ''[[Hepatocystis]]'' is nested within (paraphytic with) the genus ''Plasmodium'' and appears to lie within the primate-rodent clade&lt;ref name="Seethamchai2008"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18385364 |year=2008 |author1=Seethamchai |first1=S |title=Malaria and Hepatocystis species in wild macaques, southern Thailand |journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=646–53 |last2=Putaporntip |first2=C |last3=Malaivijitnond |first3=S |last4=Cui |first4=L |last5=Jongwutiwes |first5=S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The rodent and primate groups are relatively closely related
* The primate (subgenus ''Plasmodium'') and rodent species (subgenus ''Vinckeia'') form distinct groups
* ''P. falciparum'' and ''P. reichenowi'' (subgenus ''Laverania'') branched off early in the evolution of this genus
* The 'African' (''P. malaria'' and ''P. ovale'') and 'Asian' (''P.cynomogli'', ''P. semiovale'' and ''P. simium'') species tend to cluster together into separate clades. ''P. gonderi'' - a species isolated in Africa - groups with the Asian clade.
* ''P. vivax'' clusters with the 'Asian' species.
* The rodent species (''P. bergei'', ''P. chabaudi'' and ''P. yoelli'') form a separate clade.
*The species infecting humans do not form a single clade.&lt;ref name="Leclerc2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0031182004006146 |title=Evolutionary relationships between 15 Plasmodium species from New and Old World primates (including humans): A 18S rDNA cladistic analysis |journal=Parasitology |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=677 |year=2004 |last1=Leclerc |first1=M. C |last2=Hugot |first2=J. P |last3=Durand |first3=P |last4=Renaud |first4=F }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The genus ''[[Haemoproteus]]'' appears to lie within the bird-lizard clade
* The lizard and bird species are intermingled
* Although ''Plasmodium gallinaceum'' (subgenus ''Haemamoeba'') and ''Plasmodium elongatum'' (subgenus ''Huffia'') appear be related here so few bird species (three) have been included, this tree may not accurately reflect their real relationship.
* The bird species (''P. juxtanucleare'', ''P. gallinaceum'' and ''P. relictum'') form a clade that is related to the included ''[[Leukocytozoon]]'' and ''Haemoproteus'' species.
* While no snake parasites have been included these are likely to group with the lizard-bird division
*''[[Hepatocystis]]'' seems to lie within ''Plasmodium'' and may be related to the primate clade

The bird and lizard species are intermixed as previously found.

An analysis of the rodent genera (''[[Plasmodium berghei]]'', ''[[Plasmodium chabaudi]]'', ''[[Plasmodium vinckei]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium yoelii]]'') suggests that these species may actually be species complexes.&lt;ref name=Ramiro2012/&gt; The separation of ''P. chabaudi'' and ''P. vinckei'' has been estimated to be between {{Mya|3}} and {{Mya|13}} while that of ''P. berghei'' and ''P. yoelii'' has been placed at {{Mya|1}} and {{Mya|6}}.

A paper that included five unnamed lemur species suggested that ''P. ovale'' is more closely related to the lemur species than to the other primate ones.&lt;ref name="Pacheco2012"/&gt; It also suggested that the lemur/''P. ovale'' clade is a sister clade of the rodent species. While this is consistent with the placement of the lemur and rodent species in the subgenus ''Vinckeia'' it is inconsistent with the current placement of ''P. ovale'' within the subgenus ''Plasmodium''. This paper also supports a basal divergence within the mammalian species into the subgenus ''Laverinia'' and the others. The subgenera ''Plasmodium'' and ''Vinckeia'' with the exception of ''P. ovale'' appear to be sister clades.

Analysis of the apicoplast genes auggests that ''P. ovale'' is related to the rodent species.&lt;ref name=Arisue2012&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/mss082 |pmid=22396524 |title=The Plasmodium Apicoplast Genome: Conserved Structure and Close Relationship of P.

===Other analyses===
Examination of the protease gene (SERA) in 18 species&lt;ref name="Arisue2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0017775 |pmid=21423628 |pmc=3058004 |title=Clues to Evolution of the SERA Multigene Family in 18 Plasmodium Species |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=e17775 |year=2011 |last1=Arisue |first1=Nobuko |last2=Kawai |first2=Satoru |last3=Hirai |first3=Makoto |last4=Palacpac |first4=Nirianne M. Q |last5=Jia |first5=Mozhi |last6=Kaneko |first6=Akira |last7=Tanabe |first7=Kazuyuki |last8=Horii |first8=Toshihiro }}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that the ancestral state had only a single gene and that gene duplications have occurred in the extant species. This paper confirms the groupings found elsewhere with an Asian clade. The rodent species seem to be more closely related to the ''Laverania'' subgenus than does the subgenus ''Plasmodium''.

A deletion mutation of ~100 base pairs including part of the [[LS1 rRNA]] gene is found in the sequences of two African species - ''P. gonderi'' and an undescribed parasite taken from a mandrill - and 2 Asian species - ''P. cynomolgi'' and ''P. simiovale''.&lt;ref name="Roy2008"/&gt; This mutation was not found in the other species examined (''[[Leucocytozoon caulleryi]]'', ''[[Leucocytozoon sabrazesi]]'', ''P. bergei'', ''P. chabaudi'', ''P. falciparum'', ''P. floridense'', ''P. gallacium'', ''P. fragile'', ''P. juxtanucleare'', ''P. knowelsi'', ''P. mexicanum'', ''P. reichenowi'', ''P. relictum'', ''P. simiae'', ''P. vivax'', ''P. yoelii'' and two unnamed ''[[Haemoproteus]]'' species.) These mutations are rare events and strongly suggests these species are related.

Another paper suggests that after the mammalian-reptile/bird species split that the subgenus ''Laverina'' is basal among the mammal species.&lt;ref name=Krief2010&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000765 |pmid=20169187 |pmc=2820532 |title=On the Diversity of Malaria Parasites in African Apes and the Origin of Plasmodium falciparum from Bonobos |journal=PLoS Pathogens |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=e1000765 |year=2010 |last1=Krief |first1=Sabrina |last2=Escalante |first2=Ananias A |last3=Pacheco |first3=M.

The remaining branching order is consistent with other analyses placing the rodent species as the first branch after the ''P. falciparum''/''P. reichenowi'' clade. It places ''P. malaria'' and ''P. ovale'' as being more closely related to each other than to ''P. vivax''. This is consistent with the proposed Asian origin of ''P. vivax''.

Although bird malaria species use a variety of mosquito vectors from the genera ''[[Aedes]]'', ''[[Anopheles]]'', ''[[Culex]]'', ''[[Culiseta]]'', ''[[Mansonia]]'' and ''[[Psorophora]]'', all mammalian species use vectors only from the genus ''Anopheles''.&lt;ref name=Martinsen2008&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2007.11.012 |pmid=18248741 |title=A three-genome phylogeny of malaria parasites (Plasmodium and closely related genera): Evolution of life-history traits and host switches |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=261–73 |year=2008 |last1=Martinsen |first1=Ellen S |last2=Perkins |first2=Susan L |last3=Schall |first3=Jos J }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[host switch]] seems to have been associated with a specialization with a particular genus of mosquito.

The ability to store [[haemozoin]] appears to have evolved only once in the common ancestor of ''Haemoproteus'', ''Hepatocystis'' and ''Plasmodium''.&lt;ref name="Martinsen2008"/&gt;

A study of the relationships between ''Haemocystis'', ''Haemoproteus'', ''Leucocytozoon'' and ''Plasmodium'' suggests that (1) ''Leucocytozoon'' is basal (2) ''Haemoproteus'' is a sister clade to the remainder (3) ''Parahaemoproteus'' is a sister to ''Plasmodium'' and (4) ''Haemocystis'' is nested within ''Plasmodium''.&lt;ref name="Martinsen2008"/&gt; As before the bird/lizard species form a distinct clade.

In birds the ''Haemoproteus'' and ''Leucocytozoon'' species rarely change transmission area.&lt;ref name=Hellgren2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03227.x |pmid=17391413 |title=Detecting shifts of transmission areas in avian blood parasites - a phylogenetic approach |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=1281–90 |year=2007 |last1=Hellgren |first1=Olof |last2=Waldenström |first2=Jonas |last3=Peréz-Tris |first3=Javier |last4=Szöll |first4=Eszter |last5=Si |first5=Ö |last6=Hasselquist |first6=Dennis |last7=Krizanauskiene |first7=Asta |last8=Ottosson |first8=ULF |last9=Bensch |first9=Staffan }}&lt;/ref&gt; These parasites are restricted to one resident bird fauna over a long evolutionary time span and are not freely spread between the continents with the help of migratory birds. Lineages of the genus ''Plasmodium'' in contrast seem more freely spread between the continents. This suggests that the origin on the genus ''Plasmodium'' may have coincided with the ability to transfer between avian hosts more easily than the other genera.

An analysis of a large number of genera&lt;ref name=Galen2018&gt;Galen SC, Borner J, Martinsen ES, Schaer J, Austin CC, West CJ, Perkins SL (2018) The polyphyly of Plasmodium: comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the malaria parasites (order Haemosporida) reveal widespread taxonomic conflict. R Soc Open Sci 5(5):171780. doi: 10.1098/rsos.171780&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the taxonomy may need revision. ''Leucocytozoon'' appears to be basal to most of the Haemosporidia. The genera ''Heamoproteus'' and ''Parahaemaproteus'' are the next most basal clade. At least one species in the ''Heamoproteus'' genus grouped with the main ''Plasmodium'' clade. Within the ''Plasmodium'' clade lay the genera ''Hepatocystis'', ''Nycteria'' and ''Polychromophilus''. ''Plasmodium odocoiliei'' appeared to be very divergent in the clade. Within the palsmodium clade the reptile species formed one grouping while the subgenera ''Laverinia'', ''Plasmodium'' and ''Vinkeia'' also formed subgroupings. These results if confirmed suggest that the taxonomy of the group will need substantial revision.

===Molecular clock estimates===
All dates estimated so far using a molecular clock should probably be regarded with some suspicion given the existing disagreements between the various authors.

The branching order suggested by other analyses concurs with an analysis of the mitochondrial genes&lt;ref name="Hayakawa2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msn171 |pmid=18687771 |title=Big Bang in the Evolution of Extant Malaria Parasites |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=2233 |year=2008 |last1=Hayakawa |first1=T |last2=Culleton |first2=R |last3=Otani |first3=H |last4=Horii |first4=T |last5=Tanabe |first5=K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter paper puts the divergence between the reptile-bird and mammal clades at {{Ma|38.4}} ± 3.2 million years ago (Mya). Other divergence times reported include

Analysis of 45 single copy nuclear genes from eight species (''P. berghei'', ''P. chabaudi'', ''P. falciparum'', ''P. gallinaceum'', ''P. knowlesi'', ''P. reichenowi'', ''P. vivax'', ''P. yoelii'') using several different phylogenetic methods suggest a divergence date between ''[[Theileria]]'' and ''Plasmodium'' between {{Ma|294}} and {{Ma|314}}.&lt;ref name="Silva2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0031182010001575 |pmid=21118608 |title=Genome sequences reveal divergence times of malaria parasite lineages |journal=Parasitology |volume=138 |issue=13 |pages=1737–49 |year=2010 |last1=Silva |first1=Joana C |last2=Egan |first2=AMY |last3=Friedman |first3=Robert |last4=Munro |first4=James B |last5=Carlton |first5=Jane M |last6=Hughes |first6=Austin L |pmc=3081533 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the mutation rates suggest a date of divergence between ''P. falciparum'' and ''P. reichenowi'' between {{ma|5}} and {{ma|7}}.

The estimated date of divergence between  ''P. vivax'' and ''P. knowlesi'' was between {{ma|15}} and {{ma|46}}. This latter period coincides with the radiation of the Old World monkeys which these parasites infect. The date of divergences between ''P. berghei'', ''P. chabaudi'' and ''P. yoelii'' was estimated to be between {{ma|34}} and {{ma|25}}. The main radiation of the rodent family [[Muridae]] occurred ~{{ma|24}}.

Another paper&lt;ref name=Hayakawa2008/&gt; examining the dates of evolution using the concatenated sequences of the [[cytochrome c oxidase]] III, cytochrome c oxidase I and [[cytochrome b]] genes - all from the mitochondrion - suggested the following dates for the evolution of the species examined (''P. coatneyi'', ''P. cynomolgi'', ''P. falciparum'', ''P. fieldi'', ''P. fragile'', ''P. gonderi'', ''P. hylobati'', ''P. inui'', ''P. knowlesi'', ''P. malariae'', ''P. ovale'', ''P. reichenowi'', ''P. simiovale'', ''P. vivax'') was as follows:

While the date of evolution of ''P. falciparum'' is consistent with alternative methods, the other two dates are considerably more recent than other published estimates and probably should be treated with caution.

Another paper which examined primate, rodent, lemur, bird and reptile species suggests that the genus originated between {{Ma|30}} and {{Ma|50}}.&lt;ref name=Pacheco2012/&gt; The split between the reptile/bird and mammalian species occurred between {{Ma|31.4}} and {{Ma|47.6}}. The first division in the mammalian species was between ''Laverinia'' and the others species. The separation of ''P. falciparum'' and ''P. reichenowi'' was estimated to be between {{Ma|3.6}} and {{Ma|7.9}}. The bonobo strains of ''P. falciparum'' of were the closest relations to those of humans. This analysis grouped ''P. ovale'' with the lemur species and this clade as a sister clade to the rodent species. While this is consistent with the current placement of the lemur species with the rodent species in the subgenus ''Vinckeia'', it is inconsistent with the current placement of ''P. ovale'' in the subgenus ''Plasmodium''. The date of separation of ''P. ovale'' from the lemur species was estimated to be {{Ma|25}} and {{Ma|35}} and their date of divergence from the rodent species was dated to between {{Ma|30}} and {{Ma|50}}. The rodent species first diverged between {{Ma|10}} and {{Ma|20}}. ''P. atherui'' appears to be more closely related to the ''P. berghei''/''P. yoelli'' clade than to ''P. chabaudi''. ''P. malariae'' evolved between {{Ma|20}} and {{Ma|30}} and is more closely related to ''P. vivax'' than to ''P. ovale''. ''P vivax'' and ''P. cynomogli'' last shared an ancestor between {{Ma|2.2}} and {{Ma|4.5}}. The origin of the Asian clade was placed between {{Ma|5.0}} and {{Ma|8.2}}.

A Bayesian estimate has suggested that the genus ''Plasmodium'' evolved about {{ma|35}}.&lt;ref name="Pacheco2013"/&gt; The authors also found that the lemur clade evolved about {{ma|20}}, the rodent species about {{ma|12}}, the two known ovale species about {{ma|25}} and the Asian species about {{ma|8}}.

The branching order in this subgenus suggests that ''P. billbrayi'' and ''P. gaboni'' are sister species and form an early diverging clade. ''P. falciparum'' and ''P. reichenowi'' are sister species and they are related to ''P. billcolinsi''.

===''Laverania''===
Four species (''P. billbrayi'', ''P. billcollinsi'', ''P. falciparum'' and ''P. reichenowi'') form a clade within the subgenus ''Lavernia''. This subgenus is more closely related to the other primate species than to the bird species or the included ''Leuocytozoon'' species. Both ''P. billbrayi''  and ''P. billcollinsi'' infect both the chimpanzee subspecies included in this study (''[[Pan troglodytes troglodytes]]'' and ''[[Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii]]''). ''P. falciparum'' infects the bonbo (''[[Pan paniscus]]'') and ''P. reichenowi'' infects only one subspecies (''Pan troglodytes troglodytes''). Caution has been raised about the adequacy of the description of these new species.&lt;ref name="Valkiūnas2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2011.02.008 |pmid=21497136 |title=A cautionary note concerning Plasmodium in apes |journal=Trends in Parasitology |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=231–2 |year=2011 |last1=Valkiūnas |first1=Gediminas |last2=Ashford |first2=Richard W |last3=Bensch |first3=Staffan |last4=Killick-Kendrick |first4=Robert |last5=Perkins |first5=Susan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Plasmodium falciparum'' was found in one gorilla and two chimpanzee samples. Two chimpanzee samples tested positive for ''Plasmodium ovale'' and one for ''Plasmodium malariae''. Additionally one chimpanzee sample showed the presence of ''P. reichenowi'' and another ''P. gaboni''. A new species - ''[[Plasmodium malagasi]]'' - was provisionally identified in the lemur. This species seems likely to belong to the ''Vinckeia'' subgenus but further work is required.

A study of ~3000 wild ape specimens collected from Central Africa has shown that ''Plasmodium'' infection is common and is usually with multiple species.&lt;ref name="Liu2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature09442 |pmid=20864995 |pmc=2997044 |title=Origin of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in gorillas |journal=Nature |volume=467 |issue=7314 |pages=420–5 |year=2010 |last1=Liu |first1=Weimin |last2=Li |first2=Yingying |last3=Learn |first3=Gerald H |last4=Rudicell |first4=Rebecca S |last5=Robertson |first5=Joel D |last6=Keele |first6=Brandon F |last7=Ndjango |first7=Jean-Bosco N |last8=Sanz |first8=Crickette M |last9=Morgan |first9=David B |last10=Locatelli |first10=Sabrina |last11=Gonder |first11=Mary K |last12=Kranzusch |first12=Philip J |last13=Walsh |first13=Peter D |last14=Delaporte |first14=Eric |last15=Mpoudi-Ngole |first15=Eitel |last16=Georgiev |first16=Alexander V |last17=Muller |first17=Martin N |last18=Shaw |first18=George M |last19=Peeters |first19=Martine |last20=Sharp |first20=Paul M |last21=Rayner |first21=Julian C |last22=Hahn |first22=Beatrice H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ape species included in the study were western gorillas (''[[Gorilla gorilla]]''), eastern gorillas (''[[Gorilla beringei]]''), bonobos (''[[Pan paniscus]]'') and chimpanzees (''[[Pan troglodytes]]''). 99% of the strains fell into six species within the subgenus ''Laverina''. ''P. falciparum'' formed a monophyletic lineage within the gorilla parasite radiation suggesting an origin in gorillas rather than chimpanzees.

It has been shown that ''P. falciparum'' forms a clade with the species ''P. reichenowi''.&lt;ref name="Rich2009"&gt;Rich SM, Leendertz FH, Xu G, Lebreton M, Djoko CF, Aminake MN, Takang EE, Diffo JL, Pike BL, Rosenthal BM, Formenty P, Boesch C, Ayala FJ, Wolfe ND (2009) The origin of malignant malaria. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA&lt;/ref&gt; This clade may have originated between {{ma|3}} and 10000 years ago. It is proposed that the origin of ''P. falciparum'' may have occurred when its precursors developed the ability to bind to sialic acid Neu5Ac possibly via erythrocyte binding protein 175. Humans lost the ability to make the sialic acid Neu5Gc from its precursor Neu5Ac several million years ago and this may have protected them against infection with ''P. reichenowi''.

Another paper has suggested that the ''P. falciparum'' isolates found in apes are derived from humans and that ''P. falciparum'' and ''P. reichenowi'' diverged when humans and chimpanzees/gorillas did (between {{ma|5}} and {{ma|7}}).&lt;ref name="Silva2010"/&gt;

The relationship of this species to others in the subgenus has yet to be clarified.

===''Plasmodium''===
[[Colobine]] and [[macaque]] monkeys migrated from [[Africa]] into the Eurasian continent 10 and 6 millions of years ago respectively and became the ancestors of the extant Asian Old World monkey species.&lt;ref name="Stewart1998"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(99)80350-9 |pmid=10469576 |title=Primate evolution — in and out of Africa |journal=Current Biology |volume=9 |issue=15 |pages=R547–50 |year=1999 |last1=Moyà-Solà |first1=Salvador |last2=Köhler |first2=Meike |last3=Alba |first3=David M |last4=Stewart |first4=Caro-Beth |last5=Disotell |first5=Todd R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian Old World monkey malaria parasite species infect both colobine and macaque monkeys. The existing divergence between the Asian and African clade of this subgenus seems likely to have been caused by intercontinental [[allopatric speciation]] along with that of their hosts.

Malaria parasites of the lemurs are not traditionally grouped with the subgenus ''Plasmodium'' being placed rather within subgenus ''[[Vinckeia]]''. This classification may not be correct.&lt;ref name=Pacheco2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-299 |pmid=21992100 |pmc=3228831 |title=Timing the origin of human malarias: The lemur puzzle |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=11 |pages=299 |year=2011 |last1=Pacheco |first1=M Andreína |last2=Battistuzzi |first2=Fabia U |last3=Junge |first3=Randall E |last4=Cornejo |first4=Omar E |last5=Williams |first5=Cathy V |last6=Landau |first6=Irene |last7=Rabetafika |first7=Lydia |last8=Snounou |first8=Georges |last9=Jones-Engel |first9=Lisa |last10=Escalante |first10=Ananias A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on an analysis of the mitochondria, these parasites seem to group with the others infecting primates. The origin of the primate infecting species (excluding those in the ''Laverina'' subgenus) may date back to the [[Eocene]] - a time when the primate radiation began. This analysis also suggests that the species infecting gorillas and humans may have originated in chimps.

===''Plasmodium'': Asian clade===
At least nine species belong to the 'Asian' clade of ''Plasmodium''. These species include ''[[Plasmodium coatneyi]]'', ''[[Plasmodium cynomolgi]]'', ''[[Plasmodium fieldi]]'', ''[[Plasmodium fragile]]'', ''[[Plasmodium inui]]'', ''[[Plasmodium hylobati]]'', ''[[Plasmodium simiovale]]'', ''[[Plasmodium simium]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]''.

As a rule (with the noticeable exception of ''P. knowesli''), the Asian species have a 72-hour intra erythroctytic life cycle.
 
Analysis of the [[merozoite surface protein]] in ten species of the Asian clade suggest that this group diversified between 3 and 6.3 million years ago - a period that coincided with the radiation of the macques within South East Asia.&lt;ref name="Sawai2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-10-52 |pmid=20167126 |pmc=2832629 |title=Lineage-specific positive selection at the merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1) locus of Plasmodium vivax and related simian malaria parasites |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=10 |pages=52 |year=2010 |last1=Sawai |first1=Hiromi |last2=Otani |first2=Hiroto |last3=Arisue |first3=Nobuko |last4=Palacpac |first4=Nirianne |last5=De Oliveira Martins |first5=Leonardo |last6=Pathirana |first6=Sisira |last7=Handunnetti |first7=Shiroma |last8=Kawai |first8=Satoru |last9=Kishino |first9=Hirohisa |last10=Horii |first10=Toshihiro |last11=Tanabe |first11=Kazuyuki }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inferred branching order differs from that found from the analysis of other genes suggesting that this phylogenetic tree may be difficult to resolve. Positive selection on this gene was also found.

In an analysis of the SSU rRNA gene it was found that all Asian simian ''Plasmodium'' species have a single S-type-like gene and several A-type-like genes.&lt;ref name=Nishimoto2008&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2008.01.031 |pmid=18334303 |title=Evolution and phylogeny of the heterogeneous cytosolic SSU rRNA genes in the genus Plasmodium☆ |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=45–53 |year=2008 |last1=Nishimoto |first1=Yuriko |last2=Arisue |first2=Nobuko |last3=Kawai |first3=Satoru |last4=Escalante |first4=Ananias A |last5=Horii |first5=Toshihiro |last6=Tanabe |first6=Kazuyuki |last7=Hashimoto |first7=Tetsuo }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 50 residue insertion in the V7 variable region near the stem 43 is shared exclusively by the S-type like sequences of the Asian simian ''Plasmodium'' species and the S- and O-type sequences of ''P. vivax''. This is consistent with their shared ancestry.

''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' may have originated in [[Asia]] and the related species ''[[Plasmodium simium]]'' appears to be derived through a transfer from the human ''P. vivax'' to [[New World]] [[monkey]] species in [[South America]]. This was proposed in a study of howler monkeys near [[São Paulo]], [[Brasil]].&lt;ref name="Fonseca1951"&gt;''Plasmodium simium'', Fonseca 1951 1.13 (1951): 153-61.DPDx.

One clade included all the human strains: the second clade seems likely to be an undescribed species. The gorilla and chimpnazee strains did not group by species suggesting that ''P. vivax'' transmission occurs between these species. The authors suggested an Africa origin for ''P. vivax.''

A paper has suggested that ''P. vivax'' has an African origin and underwent a severe bottleneck and then expanded rapidly once it left Africa.&lt;ref name=Loy2018&gt;Loy DE, Plenderleith LJ, Sundararaman SA, Liu W, Gruszczyk J, Chen YJ, Trimboli S, Learn GH, MacLean OA, Morgan ALK, Li Y, Avitto AN, Giles J, Calvignac-Spencer S, Sachse A, Leendertz FH, Speede S, Ayouba A, Peeters M, Rayner JC, Tham WH, Sharp PM, Hahn BH (2018) Evolutionary history of human ''Plasmodium vivax'' revealed by genome-wide analyses of related ape parasites. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA&lt;/ref&gt;

An African origin for ''P. vivax'' would explain the presence of ''P. gonderi'' - an Africa species - within this clade. 

''[[Plasmodium]]'' species have been isolated from [[orangutan]]s.&lt;ref name="Pacheco2012"/&gt; These isolates appear to belong to the Asian clade and share an ancestor with ''[[Plasmodium inui]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium hylobati]]''.

''P. vivax'' and ''P. knowesli'' appear to have diverged 25–30 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Silva2010"/&gt;

''P. gonderi'' appears to be basal in this clade.&lt;ref name=Putaporntip2013/&gt; This is consistent with its African distribution rather than the mainly Asian distribution of the other species in this group.

Several of the 'Asian' clade  - ''[[Plasmodium coatneyi]]'', ''[[Plasmodium cynomolgi]]'', ''[[Plasmodium fragile]]'',  ''[[Plasmodium inui]]'', ''[[Plasmodium fieldi]]'', ''[[Plasmodium hylobati]]'', ''[[Plasmodium inui]]'', ''[[Plasmodium knowlesi]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium simiovale]]'' and an African species ''[[Plasmodium gonderi]]'' - have a single S-type-like gene and several A-type-like genes. It seems likely that these species form a clade within the subgenus ''Plasmodium''.

The 'Asian' species form a clade with ''P. simium'' and ''P. vivax'' being clearly closely related as are ''P. knowseli'' and ''P. coatneyi'' and ''P. fragile'';&lt;ref name="Putaporntip2013"/&gt; similarly ''P. brazillium'' and ''P. malariae'' are related. ''P. hylobati'' and ''P. inui'' are closely related. ''P. fragile'' and ''P. gonderi'' appear to be more closely related to ''P. vivax'' than to ''P. malariae''.

An analysis of four apicoplast genome-encoded genes (small subunit rRNA, large subunit rRNA and caseinolytic protease C) of nine 'Asian' species (''P. coatneyi'', ''P. cynomolgi'', ''P. fieldi'', ''P. fragile'', ''P. hylobati'', ''P. inui'', ''P. knowlesi'', ''P. simiovale'' and ''P. vivax'') and the African species ''P. gonderi'' suggests that ''P. coatneyi'' and ''P. knowlesi'' are closely related and that ''P. fragile'' is the species most closely related to these two.&lt;ref name="Mitsui2009"&gt;Mitsui H, Arisue N, Sakihama N, Inagaki Y, Horii T, Hasegawa M, Tanabe K, Hashimoto T. (2009) Phylogeny of Asian primate malaria parasites inferred from apicoplast genome-encoded genes with special emphasis on the positions of ''Plasmodium vivax'' and ''P. fragile''. Gene 450 (1-2) 32-38&lt;/ref&gt; Also ''P. vivax'' and ''P. cynomolgi'' appear to be related.

The pattern emerging from this data suggests that the ancestor of ''P. gonderi'' and the 'Asian' clade (''P. coatneyi'', ''P. cynomolgi'', ''P. fieldi'', ''P. fragile'', ''P. hylobati'', ''P. inui'', ''P. knowlesi'', ''P. simiovale'' and ''P. vivax'') infected a primate host - perhaps the ancestor of the extant [[rhesus monkey]] - and migrated with its vertebrate host from Africa to Asia via the Middle East. The Asian branch then gave rise to several clades -  ''P. fragile''-''P. coatneyi''/''P. knowlesi'', ''P. hylobati''/''P. inui'' and ''P. cynomolgi'' - ''P. simium''/''P. vivax''. ''P. fieldi'', ''P. simiovale'' and ''P. vivax'' appear to be relatively early diverging species within this clade.&lt;ref name="Putaporntip2013"/&gt; ''P. fieldi'' and ''P. simiovale'' appear to be each other's closest relations.

A summary of the currently understood branching order is as follows:

*''P. gondori'' - Asian clade
*''P. fieldi'', ''P. simiovale'', ''P. vivax'', ''P. simium'', ''P. cynomolgi'', ''P. inui'' - ''P. fragile'', ''P. coatneyi'', ''P. knowlesi'', ''P. hylobati''
*''P. vivax''/''P. simium'' - ''P. fieldi'', ''P. simiovale'', ''P. cynomolgi'', ''P. inui''
*''P. cynomolgi''/''P. inui'' - ''P. fieldi''/''P. simiovale''
*''P. fragile''/''P. coatneyi'' - ''P. knowlesi''/''P. hylobati''

This branching order may have to be revised as more data becomes available. The timing of these events is still rather uncertain.

The African species ''P. georgesi'' appears to be a close relation of ''P. gondori''.

Another paper suggests that ''P. coatneyi'' and ''P. knowlesi'' are sister species while ''P. hylobati'' and ''P. inui'' are also sister species.&lt;ref name=Krief2010/&gt; This analysis supports the grouping of ''P. fieldi'' and ''P. semiovale'' as sister species with their closest relation being ''P. cynomogli''. It also agrees with previous analyses that place ''P. simium'' and ''P. vivax'' as sister species. It also agrees that ''P. gondori'' is the African species most closely related to the Asian clade.

This branching order may have some difficulties. A deletion of the LS1 rRNA gene of ''P. gonderi'' ''P. cynomolgi'' and ''P. simiovale'' has been reported.&lt;ref name="Roy2008"&gt;Roy SW, Irimia M (2008) Origins of human malaria: rare genomic changes and full mitochondrial genomes confirm the relationship of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' to other mammalian parasites but complicate the origins of ''Plasmodium vivax''. Mol Biol Evol. 25(6):1192-1198.&lt;/ref&gt; This mutation was not found in the other species of this group that were examined - ''P. fragile'', ''P. knowelsi'', ''P. simiae'' and ''P. vivax''. These mutations are rare and suggest a relationship between the first three species to the exclusion of the others.

;Host relations

''P. cynomolgi'', ''P. inui'' and ''P. knowlesi'' infect primates of the genus ''[[Surili|Presbytis]]''.

''P. cynomolgi'', ''P. fieldi'', ''P. inui'', ''P. knowlesi'' and ''P. semiovale'' infect primates of the genus ''[[Macaca (genus)|Macaca]]''.

''P. georgesi'' and ''P. gondori'' infect primates of the genus ''[[Cocerebus]]''.

''P. gondori'' infects primates of the genus ''[[Mandillus]]''.

;Additional species

Within the 'Asian' clade are three unnamed potential species. One infects each of the two chimpanzee subspecies included in the study (''[[Pan troglodytes troglodytes]]'' and ''[[Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii]]'').&lt;ref name="Duval2010"/&gt; These appear to be related to the ''P. vivax''/''P. simium'' clade.

A new species - yet to be formally described - has been reported from orangutans (''[[Pongo pygmaeus]]'') in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=Pacheco2012/&gt;  This species was identified from mitochondrial DNA in the blood of the hosts. It appears to be related to the other members of the Asian clade.

Another as yet unnamed species likely to belong to this group has been identified in the mandrill (''[[Mandrillus sphinx]]'').&lt;ref name="Roy2008"/&gt;

===''Plasmodium'': African clade===
The species infecting Old World monkeys (subgenus ''Plasmodium'') seem to form a clade.

''P. ovale'' is more closely related to ''P. malariae'' than to ''P. vivax''.&lt;ref name="Putaporntip2013"/&gt;

''[[Plasmodium ovale]]'' has recently been shown to consist of two cocirculating species - ''[[Plasmodium ovale curtisi]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium ovale wallikeri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/652240|title=Two nonrecombining sympatric forms of the human malaria parasite ''Plasmodium ovale'' occur globally|vauthors=Sutherland CJ, Tanomsing N, Nolder D, Oguike M, Jennison C, Pukrittayakamee S, Dolecek C, Hien TT, do Rosário VE, Arez AP, Pinto J, Michon P, Escalante AA, Nosten F, Burke M, Lee R, Blaze M, Otto TD, Barnwell JW, Pain A, Williams J, White NJ, Day NP, Snounou G, Lockhart PJ, Chiodini PL, Imwong M, Polley SD |journal=J Infect Dis|year=2010|volume=201|issue=10|pages=1544&amp;ndash;50|pmid=20380562}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two species can only be distinguished by genetic means and they separated between {{Ma|1.0}} and {{Ma|3.5}}. A second estimate has placed the separation of these species at {{Ma|4.5}} (95% confidence interval 0.7-7.7 Mya)&lt;ref name="Putaporntip2013"/&gt;

''P. ovale'', based on an analysis of the apicoplast genome, appears to be related to the rodent species suggesting an ancestral host switch.&lt;ref name=Arisue2012/&gt;

The relationship between the ''P. ovale'' species and those with rodent hosts has been confirmed by sequencing the genomes of both ''P. ovale species''.&lt;ref name=Rutledge2017&gt;Rutledge GG, Böhme U, Sanders M, Reid AJ, Cotton JA, Maiga-Ascofare O, Djimdé AA, Apinjoh TO, Amenga-Etego L, Manske M, Barnwell JW, Renaud F, Ollomo B, Prugnolle F, Anstey NM, Auburn S, Price RN, McCarthy JS, Kwiatkowski DP, Newbold CI, Berriman M, Otto TD (2017) ''Plasmodium malariae'' and ''P. ovale'' genomes provide insights into malaria parasite evolution. Nature 542(7639):101-104&lt;/ref&gt;

One paper has reported a strain of malaria in a chimpanzee with a mitochondrial sequence identical to that of ''P. ovale'' and a second closely related to it.&lt;ref name=Duval2009&gt;Duval L, Nerrienet E, Rousset D, Sadeuh Mba SA, Houze S, Fourment M, Le Bras J, Robert V, Ariey F (2009) Chimpanzee malaria parasites related to ''Plasmodium ovale'' in Africa. PLoS One 4(5):e5520. {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems likely as has been proposed earlier that ''P. ovale'' may have an animal reservoir.

Two unnamed potential species infect the bonbo (''[[Pan paniscus]]'') and these are related to the ''P. malariae''/''P. brazillium'' clade.

The species ''P. gonderi'' appears to be the closest relation to the Asian clade.

===''Plasmodium malariae''===
''[[Plasmodium malariae]]'' has been considered to be closely related to ''[[Plasmodium brasilianum]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium rhodiani]]''. These species may be a single species with multiple hosts.&lt;ref name=Rayner2015&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.08.035 |pmid=26501096 |pmc=4588403 |title=Plasmodium malariae Malaria: From Monkey to Man? |journal=EBio ''Medicine'' |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=1023–1024 |year=2015 |last1=Rayner |first1=Julian C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the number of strains that have examined to date remains small, retirement of the ''brasilianum'' and ''rhodiani'' species names to junior synonym status should probably be delayed.

===Rodent species===
Although the branching order among the mammalian clades has not yet been determined the branching order in the rodent infections species has been studied.&lt;ref name="Ramiro2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perkins2007&gt;Perkins SL, Sarkar IN, Carter R (2007) The phylogeny of rodent malaria parasites: simultaneous analysis across three genomes. Infect Genet Evol 7(1):74-83&lt;/ref&gt; The rodent parasites (''P. berghei'', ''P. chabaudi'', ''P. vinckei'' and ''P. yoelii'') seem to form a distinct clade. ''P. berghei'' and ''P. yoelii'' appear to be sister species as do ''P. chabaudi'' and ''P. vinckei''. The separation dates between ''P. berghei'' and ''P. yoelii'' has been estimated to be {{Ma|4.5}} (95% credibility interval 2.5 - 6.0); that between ''P. chabaudi'' and ''P. vinckei'' has been estimated to be {{Ma|9.0}} (95% credibility interval 5.5 - 12.6); and that between the ''P. berghei''/''P. yoelii''  and ''P. chabaudi''/''P. vinckei'' clades to be {{Ma|12.5}} (95% credibility interval 9.0 - 17.5). These estimates are consistent with those from another paper that included a number of primate infecting species.&lt;ref name=Hayakawa2008/&gt;

''P. atheruri'' appears to be the sister species of ''P. vinckei''.&lt;ref name=Santiago-Alarcon2010&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.10.003 |pmid=19854196 |title=Phylogenetic relationships of haemosporidian parasites in New World Columbiformes, with emphasis on the endemic Galapagos dove |journal=International Journal for Parasitology |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=463–70 |year=2010 |last1=Santiago-Alarcon |first1=Diego |last2=Outlaw |first2=Diana C |last3=Ricklefs |first3=Robert E |last4=Parker |first4=Patricia G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notes===
A recently (2009) described species (''[[Plasmodium hydrochaeri]]'') that infects capybaras (''[[Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris]]'') may complicate the phylogentics of this genus.&lt;ref name="DonSantos2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.03.042 |pmid=19411142 |title=Detection of Plasmodium sp.

Further work in this area seems indicated.

Unlike other eukaryotes studied to date ''Plasmodium'' species have two or three distinct SSU rRNA (18S rRNA) molecules encoded within the genome.&lt;ref name="Nishimoto2008"/&gt; These have been divided into types A, S and O. Type A is expressed in the asexual stages; type S in the sexual and type O only in the oocyte. Type O is only known to occur in ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' at present. The reason for this gene duplication is not known but presumably reflects an adaption to the different environments the parasite lives within.

It has been reported that the C terminal domain of the RNA polymerase 2 in the primate infecting species (other than ''P. falciparum'' and probably ''P. reichenowei'') appears to be unusual&lt;ref name="Kishore2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00239-009-9245-2 |pmid=19449052 |pmc=3622039 |title=An Unusual Recent Expansion of the C-Terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II in Primate Malaria Parasites Features a Motif Otherwise Found Only in Mammalian Polymerases |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=706–14 |year=2009 |last1=Kishore |first1=Sandeep P |last2=Perkins |first2=Susan L |last3=Templeton |first3=Thomas J |last4=Deitsch |first4=Kirk W }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the classification of species into the subgenus ''Plasmodium'' may have an evolutionary and biological basis.

It is known from many written historical sources that ''P. vivax'' malaria was endemic in the wetlands of [[England]] from the 1500s until the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Gowland2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21648 |pmid=22183814 |title=Morbidity in the marshes: Using spatial epidemiology to investigate skeletal evidence for malaria in Anglo-Saxon England (AD 410-1050) |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=147 |issue=2 |pages=301–11 |year=2012 |last1=Gowland |first1=R.L |last2=Western |first2=A.G }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suspected that this disease was introduced by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] sometime before 400 AD. It seems likely that it remained endemic in these areas at least up to 1000 AD.

A study in [[Senegal]] of 25 strains isolated there suggests that ''P. falciparum'' underwent a major (60-fold) population expansion of ~20,000-40,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Chang2012&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/mss161 |pmid=22734050 |pmc=3472501 |title=Genomic Sequencing of Plasmodium falciparum Malaria Parasites from Senegal Reveals the Demographic History of the Population |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=29 |issue=11 |pages=3427–39 |year=2012 |last1=Chang |first1=Hsiao-Han |last2=Park |first2=Daniel J |last3=Galinsky |first3=Kevin J |last4=Schaffner |first4=Stephen F |last5=Ndiaye |first5=Daouda |last6=Ndir |first6=Omar |last7=Mboup |first7=Souleymane |last8=Wiegand |first8=Roger C |last9=Volkman |first9=Sarah K |last10=Sabeti |first10=Pardis C |last11=Wirth |first11=Dyann F |last12=Neafsey |first12=Daniel E |last13=Hartl |first13=Daniel L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A population study based on isolates from several countries suggests that distinct clustering of continental populations - Africa, Southeast Asia and Oceania - has occurred.&lt;ref name=Campino2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0020251 |pmid=21673999 |pmc=3108946 |title=Population Genetic Analysis of Plasmodium falciparum Parasites Using a Customized Illumina Golden ''Gate'' Genotyping Assay |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e20251 |year=2011 |last1=Campino |first1=Susana |last2=Auburn |first2=Sarah |last3=Kivinen |first3=Katja |last4=Zongo |first4=Issaka |last5=Ouedraogo |first5=Jean-Bosco |last6=Mangano |first6=Valentina |last7=Djimde |first7=Abdoulaye |last8=Doumbo |first8=Ogobara K |last9=Kiara |first9=Steven M |last10=Nzila |first10=Alexis |last11=Borrmann |first11=Steffen |last12=Marsh |first12=Kevin |last13=Michon |first13=Pascal |last14=Mueller |first14=Ivo |last15=Siba |first15=Peter |last16=Jiang |first16=Hongying |last17=Su |first17=Xin-Zhuan |last18=Amaratunga |first18=Chanaki |last19=Socheat |first19=Duong |last20=Fairhurst |first20=Rick M |last21=Imwong |first21=Mallika |last22=Anderson |first22=Timothy |last23=Nosten |first23=François |last24=White |first24=Nicholas J |last25=Gwilliam |first25=Rhian |last26=Deloukas |first26=Panos |last27=MacInnis |first27=Bronwyn |last28=Newbold |first28=Christopher I |last29=Rockett |first29=Kirk |last30=Clark |first30=Taane G |display-authors=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these grouping there has been some further clustering - West Africa versus East Africa, Thailand versus Cambodia. No distinction was identified between isolates from [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]].

==Host range==
Because of the number of species parasited by ''Plasmodium'' further discussion has been broken down into following pages:

* [[Plasmodium species infecting humans and other primates]]
* [[Plasmodium species infecting mammals other than primates]]
* [[Plasmodium species infecting birds]]
* [[Plasmodium species infecting reptiles]]

==Criteria used for speciation==
The vertebrate host is the first criterion used for speciation and may be sufficient alone to determine the subgenus as in ''[[Ophidiella]]'' and ''[[Vinckeia]]''.
The morphological features of the parasite itself most commonly used to describe a species include the number of pigment granules, the degree of encirclement of the host nucleus, the size of the parasite, the degree of host nucleus displacement and the degree of host cell enlargement.

==Unnamed species==
At least one species has been isolated from the mandrill (''[[Mandrillus leucophaeus]]'') that awaits full publication. It is currently known as ''Plasmodium'' sp. DAJ-2004.

At least one species related to ''P. ovale'' appears to be present in chimpanzees. It is known only from a DNA sequence and awaits description.

''P. vivax'' strains can be separated into two distinct types depending on the organisation of the A and S [[rRNA]] genes.&lt;ref name="Li2001"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11266292 |pmc=2631686 |year=2001 |author1=Li |first1=J |title=Geographic subdivision of the range of the malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=35–42 |last2=Collins |first2=W. E |last3=Wirtz |first3=R. A |last4=Rathore |first4=D |last5=Lal |first5=A |last6=McCutchan |first6=T. F |doi=10.3201/eid0701.700035 |doi-broken-date=2018-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A gene conversion occurred in an Old World strain and this mutated strain give rise to a new calde of parasites in the New World. The Old World strains were subsequently re introduced - possibly via the slave trade - and these are related to the monkey parasite ''P. simium''. The specific name ''Plasmodium collinsi'' has been proposed for the New World strains but this has not yet been accepted.

A second mutation is present in the ORF 470 gene of the plasmid in the New World ''P. vivax'' strains. This protein is highly conserved. In the Old World strains of ''P. vivax'' and its relations a valine is present. In the New World strains this residue has been replaced by an isoleucine (G -&gt; A in the first codon position).

Two separate strains of ''P. vivax'' can be identified on the basis of the circumsporozoite protein ([[circumsporozoite protein|CSP]]) gene.&lt;ref name="Lim2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0507413102 |pmid=16227436 |pmc=1266129 |title=Plasmodium vivax: Recent world expansion and genetic identity to Plasmodium simium |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=102 |issue=43 |pages=15523–8 |year=2005 |last1=Lim |first1=C. S |last2=Tazi |first2=L |last3=Ayala |first3=F. J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these alleles can be found in ''P. simium'' and they occur both in the New and Old Worlds. This suggests a complex history of transmission across the world and between species.

Another as yet unnamed species was isolated from humans in [[Madang]], [[Papua New Guinea]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="Qari1993"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(93)90559-Y |title=Identification of Plasmodium vivax-like human malaria parasite |journal=The Lancet |volume=341 |issue=8848 |pages=780 |year=1993 |last1=Qari |first1=S.H |last2=Shi |first2=Y.P |last3=Goldman |first3=I.F |last4=Udhaykumar |first4=V |last5=Collins |first5=W.E |last6=Lal |first6=A.A |last7=Alpers |first7=M.P }}&lt;/ref&gt; This species differed immunologically and genetically from then generally recognised species infecting humans. Additional isolates of this putative species were also found in [[Sepik]] also in Papua New Guinea, [[Brazil]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref name="Qari1993_1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/infdis/168.6.1485 |pmid=8245533 |title=Global Occurrence of Plasmodium vivax-like Human Malaria Parasite |journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=168 |issue=6 |pages=1485–9 |year=1993 |last1=Qari |first1=S.

A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circumsporozoite protein of this species appears to be identical to that of ''[[Plasmodium semiovale]]''. At least two species of mosquito ''[[Anopheles deaneorum]]'' and ''[[Anopheles oswaldoi]]'' appear to be capable of transmitting this parasite.&lt;ref name="Marrelli1993"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0035-9203(98)90723-4 |pmid=9764317 |title=Correlation between positive serology for Plasmodium vivax-like/Plasmodium simiovale malaria parasites in the human and anopheline populations in the State of Acre, Brazil |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=149–51 |year=1998 |last1=Marrelli |first1=Mauro Toledo |last2=Branquinho |first2=Maria Stela |last3=Esther Hoffmann |first3=Erika Hellena |last4=Taipe-Lagos |first4=Carmen Beatriz |last5=Natal |first5=Delsio |last6=Kloetzel |first6=Judith Kardos }}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports have not gone unchallenged and the status of this putative species is unclear at present.&lt;ref name="Gopinath1994"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/infdis/170.6.1630 |pmid=7996011 |title=Failure to Detect a Plasmodium vivax-Like Malaria Parasite in Globally Collected Blood Samples |journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=170 |issue=6 |pages=1630–3 |year=1994 |last1=Gopinath |first1=R |last2=Wongsrichanalai |first2=C |last3=Cordon-Rosales |first3=C |last4=Mirabelli |first4=L |last5=Kyle |first5=D |last6=Kain |first6=K.

This article is a list of countries by [[electricity generation]] from [[Renewable energy|renewable]] sources every year.  Note that most countries import and/or export  electricity, so the percentage figures do not reflect the percentage of consumption that is renewable based.

Based on [[REN21]]'s 2016 report, renewables contributed 19.2% to humans' [[World energy consumption|global energy consumption]] and 23.7% to their generation of electricity in 2014 and 2015, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 8.9% coming from [[Biofuel#traditional|traditional biomass]], 4.2% as heat energy (modern biomass, geothermal and solar heat), 3.9% hydro electricity and 2.2% is electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and [[Biofuel|biomass]]. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$286 billion in 2015, with countries like [[Renewable energy in China|China]] and the [[Renewable energy in the United States|United States]] heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;[[REN21]], [http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_FullReport_.pdf Global Status Report 2016]. Retrieved 09-30-2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, there are an estimated 7.7 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with [[solar photovoltaics]] being the largest renewable employer.&lt;ref&gt;[[IRENA]], [http://www.irena.org/menu/index.aspx?mnu=Subcat&amp;PriMenuID=36&amp;CatID=141&amp;SubcatID=585 Renewable energy and jobs], ''Annual review 2015'', IRENA.Retrieved 09-30-2017.&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2015}} worldwide, more than half of all new electricity capacity installed was renewable.&lt;ref name=guardianiea2015&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/renewables-made-up-half-of-net-electricity-capacity-added-last-year|title=Renewables made up half of net electricity capacity added last year|first=Adam|last=Vaughan|date=25 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}Retrieved 09-30-2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12994">Below is a '''list of [[fern]] (Pteridophyta) families''', and the genera which are placed in them, using the classification scheme proposed by Smith ''et al.'' (2006),&lt;ref name=Smith-2006/&gt; placed in the linear order of Christenhusz ''et al.'' (2011).&lt;ref name=Christenhusz-2011b/&gt;  Note that Smith ''et al.'' (2006) used the more traditional classes as listed below, while Christenhusz ''et al.'' (2011) used the corresponding subclasses (shown in square brackets) proposed by Chase and Reveal in 2009.&lt;ref name=Chase-2009/&gt;  In their proposal, all land plants (embryophytes) are placed in a single class, [[Equisetopsida sensu lato|Equisetopsida]], and the ferns (monilophytes) are assigned five of the 14 Equisetopsida subclasses.  However, Christenhusz ''et al.'' merged the Psilotidae into the Ophioglossidae subclass, leaving four fern subclasses, corresponding to the four classes of Smith ''et al.''

'''Forest parks''' ({{lang-th|วนอุทยาน}}) in [[Thailand]] are [[protected area]]s set aside for conservation and protection from development owing to their natural scenic value that are too small to be declared [[List of national parks of Thailand|national parks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/vitri/research/Educational_Projects/forrsa/RE_1_Proceedings/Forrsa_RE_1/RE_1_proceedings_pdf/Report_Gr4.pdf Natural Forest Management for Biodiversity Conservation in Thailand]&lt;/ref&gt; The forest parks are governed by the [[Provinces of Thailand|provincial]] administrations. Thailand's forest parks fall under [[IUCN]] Category V, (Protected Landscape/Seascape).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/pa/pa_products/wcpa_categories/pa_categoryv/ IUCN Category V - Protected Landscape/seascape Ecotourism Resources and Management in Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330234012/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/pa/pa_products/wcpa_categories/pa_categoryv/ |date=2012-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a total of 69 Forest Parks in Thailand, covering a combined land surface of 880 km², which is about a 0.17% of the total area of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conservation.forest.ku.ac.th/ecotourdb/Cgi-bin/ARTICLE/article_pdf/Ecotourism_re_mgt_Thailand.pdf Ecotourism Resources and Management in Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801115027/http://conservation.forest.ku.ac.th/ecotourdb/Cgi-bin/ARTICLE/article_pdf/Ecotourism_re_mgt_Thailand.pdf |date=2014-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the first protected area was established in Thailand, their capacity to achieve their purpose has been under multiple challenges. As other protected areas such as National Parks and Wildlife Reserves, forest parks are not free from severe threats such as [[land encroachment]], [[illegal logging]] and [[poaching]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthlore.ca/clients/WPC/English/grfx/sessions/PDFs/session_3/Emphandhu.pdf Thailand’s Experience in Protected Area Management]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3062">A '''magnetic cloud''' is a transient event observed in the [[solar wind]]. It was defined in 1981 by Burlaga et al. 1981 as a region of enhanced [[magnetic field]] strength, smooth rotation of the magnetic field vector, and low [[proton]] temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Burlaga, L. F., E. Sittler, F. Mariani, and R. Schwenn, "Magnetic loop behind an interplanetary shock: Voyager, Helios and IMP-8 observations" in "Journal of Geophysical Research", 86, 6673, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic clouds are a possible manifestation of a [[coronal mass ejection]] (CME). The association between CMEs and magnetic clouds was made by Burlaga et al. in 1982 when a magnetic cloud was observed by [[Helios probes|Helios-1]] two days after being observed by [[Solar Maximum Mission|SMM]].&lt;ref&gt;Burlaga, L. F. et al., "A magnetic cloud and a coronal mass ejection" in "Geophysical Research Letter"s, 9, 1317-1320, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; However, because observations near Earth are usually done by a single spacecraft, many CMEs are not seen as being associated with magnetic clouds. The typical structure observed for a fast CME by a satellite such as [[Advanced Composition Explorer|ACE]] is a fast-mode [[shock wave]] followed by a dense (and hot) sheath of plasma (the downstream region of the shock) and a magnetic cloud.

==Other characteristics ==
Other signatures of magnetic clouds are now used in addition to the one described above: among other, bidirectional superthermal [[electron]]s, unusual charge state or abundance of [[iron]], [[helium]], [[carbon]], and/or [[oxygen]].

The typical time for a magnetic cloud to move past a satellite at the [[Lagrange Point|L1]] point is 1 day corresponding to a [[Earth radius|radius]] of 0.15 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]] with a typical speed of {{convert|450|km/s|mi/s|abbr=on}} and magnetic field strength of 20 [[Tesla (unit)|nT]].&lt;ref&gt;Lepping, R. P. et al. "Magnetic field structure of interplanetary magnetic clouds at 1 AU" in "Journal of Geophysical Research", 95, 11957-11965, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types of ejecta observed at Earth==
Magnetic clouds represent about one third of ejecta observed by satellites at Earth. Other types of ejecta are multiple-magnetic cloud events (a single structure with multiple subclouds distinguishable)&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Y. M., et al., Multiple magnetic clouds in interplanetary space, Solar Physics, 211, 333-344, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Y. M., et al., Multiple magnetic clouds: Several examples during March - April, 2001, J. Geophys. Res., 108(A10), 1370, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and complex ejecta, which can be the result of the interaction of multiple CMEs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1900">'''Magnetic energy''' and [[electric energy]]  are related by [[Maxwell's equations]]. The potential energy of a [[magnet]] of [[magnetic moment]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}&lt;/math&gt; in a [[magnetic field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[mechanical work]] of the magnetic force (actually magnetic [[torque]]) on the re-alignment of the vector of the [[Magnetic dipole moment]] and is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm p, m} = -\mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
while the energy stored in an [[inductor]] (of [[inductance]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) when a current &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; flows through it is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm p, m} = \frac{1}{2}LI^2&lt;/math&gt;.
This second expression forms the basis for superconducting magnetic energy storage.

Energy is also stored in a magnetic field. The energy per unit volume in a region of space of [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] &lt;math&gt;\mu _0&lt;/math&gt;containing magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{1}{2}\frac{B^2}{\mu_0}&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if we assume that the medium is [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] or [[diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] so that a linear constitutive equation exists that relates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;, then it can be shown that the magnetic field stores an energy of

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}\int \mathbf{H} \cdot \mathbf{B}\ dV&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is evaluated over the entire region where the magnetic field exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=John David|title=Classical Electrodynamics|date=1998|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0-471-30932-X|pages=213|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mating system''' is a way in which a group is structured in relation to sexual behaviour. The precise meaning depends upon the context. With respect to [[animals]], the term describes which males and females [[mating|mate]], under which circumstances; recognised systems include [[monogamy]], [[polygamy]] (which includes [[polygyny]], [[polyandry]], and [[polygynandry]]), and [[promiscuity]], all of which lead to different [[mate choice]] outcomes and thus these systems affect how [[sexual selection]] works in the species which practice them. In plants, the term refers to the degree and circumstances of [[outcrossing]]. In human [[sociobiology]], the terms have been extended to encompass the formation of relationships such as [[marriage]].

==In plants==
{{See also|Plant reproduction}}
The primary mating systems in plants are [[outcrossing]] (cross-fertilisation), [[autogamy]] (self-fertilisation) and [[apomixis]] (asexual reproduction without fertilization, but only when arising by modification of sexual function). Mixed mating systems, in which plants use two or even all three mating systems, are not uncommon.&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"&gt;{{cite book | author = Brown, A. H. D.| year = 1989 | chapter = Isozyme analysis of plant mating systems |editor1=Soltis, D. E. |editor2=[[Soltis, P. S.]] | title = Isozymes in Plant Biology | pages = 73–86 | publisher = Dioscorides Press | location = Portland|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of models have been used to describe the parameters of plant mating systems. The basic model is the [[mixed mating model]], which is based on the assumption that every fertilisation is either self-fertilisation or completely random cross-fertilisation. More complex models relax this assumption; for example, the [[effective selfing model]] recognises that mating may be more common between pairs of closely related plants than between pairs of distantly related plants.&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"/&gt;

==In animals==
[[File:Schimpanse Zoo Leipzig.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Chimpanzee]]s have a promiscuous mating system]]
[[File:Silverback.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Male and female [[gorilla]], gorillas have a polygynous mating system]]
{{See also|Animal sexual behaviour#Mating systems|Polygyny threshold model|Monogamous pairing in animals}}
The following are some of the mating systems generally recognized in animals:
*[[Monogamy]]: One male and one female have an exclusive mating relationship. The term "[[pair bond]]ing" often implies this. This is associated with one-male, one-female group compositions. There are two types of monogamy: type 1, which is facultative, and type 2, which is obligate. Facultative monogamy occurs when there are very low densities in a species. This means that mating occurs with only a single member of the opposite sex because males and females are very far apart. When a female needs aid from conspecifics in order to have a litter this is obligate monogamy. However, with this, the habitat carrying capacity is small so it means only one female can breed within the habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kleiman | first1 = Devra G | year = 1977 | title = Monogamy in Mammals | url = | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 39–69 | doi = 10.1086/409721 | pmid = 857268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Polygamy]]: Three types are recognized:
**[[Polygyny in nature|Polygyny]] (the most common polygamous mating system in [[vertebrates]] so far studied): One male has an exclusive relationship with two or more females. This is associated with one-male, multi-female group compositions. Many perennial ''[[Vespula squamosa ]]'' (southern yellowjacket) colonies are polygynous.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett, K. M., Osborne, D. M., Wahl, D., and Wenzel, J. W. (2001). "An Enormous Nest of Vespula squamosa from Florida, the Largest Social Was Nest Reported from North America, with Notes on Colony Cycle and Reproduction", "Journal of the New York Entomological Society", 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of polygyny exist, such as lek polygyny and resource defense polygyny. Grayling butterflies (''[[Grayling (butterfly)|Hipparchia semele]]'') engage in resource defense polygyny, where females choose a territorial male based on the best oviposition site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreisig|first=H.|date=1995-02-01|title=Thermoregulation and flight activity in territorial male graylings, Hipparchia semele (Satyridae), and large skippers, Ochlodes venata (Hesperiidae)|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=101|issue=2|pages=169–176|doi=10.1007/BF00317280|pmid=28306787|issn=0029-8549|bibcode=1995Oecol.101..169D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most animals opt for only one of these strategies, some exhibit hybrid strategies, such as the bee species, ''[[Xylocopa micans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Change in mandibular and mesosomal gland contents of maleXylocopa micans (Hymenoptera: Anthophoridae) associated with mating system|journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology|date = 1990-06-01|issn = 0098-0331|pages = 1877–1885|volume = 16|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/BF01020501|pmid = 24263991|first = H. J.|last = McAuslane|first2 = S. B.|last2 = Vinson|first3 = H. J.|last3 = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
**[[Polyandry in nature|Polyandry]]: One female has an exclusive relationship with two or more males. This is very rare and is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions. Genetic polyandry is found some insect species such as [[Western Honey Bee|''Apis mellifera'']] (the Western Honey Bee), in which a virgin queen will mate with multiple drones during her nuptial flight whereas each drone will die immediately upon mating once. The queen will then store the sperm collected from these multiple matings in her spermatheca to use to fertilize eggs throughout the course of her entire reproductive life.
**[[Polygynandry]]: Polygynandry is a slight variation of this, where two or more males have an exclusive relationship with two or more females; the numbers of males and females don't have to be equal, and in vertebrate species studied so far, the number of males is usually less. This is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions.
*[[Promiscuity]]: A member of one sex within the social group mates with any member of the opposite sex. This is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions.

These mating relationships may or may not be associated with social relationships, in which the sexual partners stay together to become parenting partners. As the alternative term "pair bonding" implies, this is usual in monogamy. In many polyandrous systems, the males and the female stay together to rear the young. In polygynous systems where the number of females paired with each male is low and the male will often stay with one female to help rear the young, while the other females rear their young on their own. In polygynandry, each of the males may assist one female; if all adults help rear all the young, the system is more usually called "[[communal breeding]]". In highly polygynous systems, and in promiscuous systems, paternal care of young is rare, or there may be no parental care at all.

These descriptions are idealized, and the social partnerships are often easier to observe than the mating relationships. In particular:
*the relationships are rarely exclusive for all individuals in a species. [[DNA fingerprinting]] studies have shown that even in pair-bonding, matings outside the pair (extra-pair copulations) occur with fair frequency, and a significant minority of offspring result from them. However, the offspring that are a result of extra-pair copulations usually exhibit more advantageous genes. These genes can be associated with improvements in appearance, mating, and the functioning of internal body systems.&lt;ref name="Bekoff"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior|last1=Bekoff|first1=Marc|date=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-32747-6|location=Westport|pages=889–891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310505282|title=Female Sneak Copulation: In: Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Psychological Science|last=Howie|first=James|date=January 2017|website=Researchgate|access-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*some species show different mating systems in different circumstances, for example in different parts of their geographical range, or under different conditions of food availability
*mixtures of the simple systems described above may occur.

[[Sexual conflict|Sexual Conflict]] occurs between individuals of different sexes that have separate or conflicting requirements for optimal mating success. This conflict may lead to competitive adaptations and co-adaptations of one or both of the sexes to maintain mating processes that are beneficial to that sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=G.

===In humans===
{{See also|Monogamy|Polygyny|Polyandry|Polyamory}}
Compared to other [[vertebrate]]s, where a species usually has a single mating system, human display great variety. Humans also differ by having formal [[marriage]]s which in some cultures involve negotiation and arrangement between elder relatives. Regarding sexual dimorphism (see the section about animals above), humans are in the intermediate group with moderate sex differences in body size but with relatively large testes. This indicates relatively frequent sperm competition which is supported by reports of extrapair paternity of 2–22% in socially monogamous and polygynous human societies. One estimate is that 83% of human societies are polygynous, 0.05% are polyandrous, and the rest are monogamous. Even the last group may at least in part be genetically polygynous.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 30 Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage systems by Bobbi S. Low&lt;/ref&gt;

From an evolutionary standpoint,  females are more prone to practice [[monogamy]] because their reproductive success is based on the resources she is able to acquire through reproduction rather than the quantity of offspring she produces. However, men are more likely to practice [[polygamy]] because his reproductive success is based on the amount of offsprings he produces, rather than any kind of benefit from parental investment.&lt;ref name="Cartwright 2002 19"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolutionary Explanations of Human Behaviour|last=Cartwright|first=John. H|publisher=Taylor and Franis e-Library|year=2002|isbn=978-0-203-47064-0|location=New York, NY|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polygyny is associated with an increased sharing of subsistence provided by women. This is consistent with the theory that if women raise the children alone, men can concentrate on the mating effort. Polygyny is also associated with greater environmental variability in the form of variability of [[rainfall]]. This may increase the differences in the resources available to men. An important association is that polygyny is associated with a higher [[pathogen]] load in an area which may make having good genes in a male increasingly important. A high pathogen load also decreases the relative importance of [[sororal polygyny]] which may be because it becomes increasingly important to have genetic variability in the offspring (See [[Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection]]).&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

Virtually all the terms used to describe animal mating systems were adopted from [[social anthropology]], where they had been devised to describe systems of [[marriage]]. This shows that human sexual behavior is unusually flexible since, in most animal species, one mating system dominates. While there are close analogies between animal mating systems and human marriage institutions, these analogies should not be pressed too far, because in human societies, marriages typically have to be recognized by the entire social group in some way, and there is no equivalent process in animal societies. The temptation to draw conclusions about what is "natural" for human sexual behavior from observations of animal mating systems should be resisted: a socio-biologist observing the kinds of behavior shown by humans in any other species would conclude that all known mating systems were natural for that species, depending on the circumstances or on individual differences.&lt;ref name="Cartwright 2002 19"/&gt;

As culture increasingly affects human mating choices, ascertaining what is the 'natural' mating system of the human animal from a zoological perspective becomes increasingly difficult. Some clues can be taken from human anatomy, which is essentially unchanged from the prehistoric past:

*humans have a large relative size of testes to body mass in comparison to most primates;
*humans have a large ejaculate volume and sperm count in comparison to other primates;
*as compared to most primates, humans spend more time in copulation;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bonobo-sex-and-society-2006-06/|title=Bonobo Sex and Society: The behavior of a close relative challenges assumptions about male supremacy in human evolution|last=De Waal|first=Frans|date=March 1996|website=Scientific American|access-date=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*as compared to most primates, humans [[copulate]] with greater frequency;
*the outward signs of [[Estrous cycle|estrous]] in women (i.e. higher body temperature, breast swelling, sugar cravings, etc.), are often perceived to be less obvious in comparison to the outward signs of ovulation in most other mammals;
*for most mammals, the estrous cycle and its outward signs bring on mating activity; the majority of female-initiated matings in humans coincides with estrous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beach|first1=Frank|title=Sexual attractivity, proceptivity, and receptivity in female mammals|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=1976|volume=7|issue=1|pages=105–138|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0018506X76900088|accessdate=20 October 2017|doi=10.1016/0018-506x(76)90008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but humans copulate throughout the reproductive cycle;
*after ejaculation/orgasm in males and females, humans release a hormone that has a sedative effect;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Esch|first1=Tobias|last2=Stefano|first2=George|title=The Neurobiology of Love|journal=Neuro Endocrinology Letters|date=June 2005|volume=26|issue=3|pages=175–92|pmid=15990719}}&lt;/ref&gt; however human females may remain sexually receptive and may remain in the plateau stage of orgasm if their orgasm has not been completed.

Some have suggested that these anatomical factors signify some degree of [[sperm competition]], though as levels of genetic and societal promiscuity are highly varied across cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raptor1.bizlab.mtsu.edu/s-drive/TEFF/662/papers2010/men_dominance/The%20Mating%20System%20of%20Foragers%20in%20the%20Standard%20Cross-Cultural%20Sample.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302125838/http://raptor1.bizlab.mtsu.edu/s-drive/TEFF/662/papers2010/men_dominance/The%20Mating%20System%20of%20Foragers%20in%20the%20Standard%20Cross-Cultural%20Sample.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; this evidence is far from conclusive.

==In microorganisms==

===Bacteria===

Mating in [[bacteria]] involves transfer of DNA from one cell to another and incorporation of the transferred DNA into the recipient bacteria’s [[genome]] by [[homologous recombination]].  Transfer of DNA between bacterial cells can occur in three main ways.  First, a bacterium can take up [[exogenous DNA]] released into the intervening medium from another bacterium by a process called [[Transformation (genetics)|'''transformation''']].  DNA can also be transferred from one bacterium to another by the process of [[Transduction (genetics)|'''transduction''']], which is mediated by an infecting virus (bacteriophage).  The third method of DNA transfer is [[Bacterial conjugation|''conjugation'']], in which a [[plasmid]] mediates transfer through direct cell contact between cells.

Transformation, unlike transduction or conjugation, depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process,&lt;ref name="pmid15083159"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen I, Dubnau D |title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation |journal=Nat. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=241–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15083159 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro844 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial [[adaptation]] for DNA transfer.  In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed [[natural competence]].  In ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' about 40 genes are required for the development of competence and DNA uptake.&lt;ref name="pmid8901420"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Solomon JM, Grossman AD |title=Who's competent and when: regulation of natural genetic competence in bacteria |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=150–5 |year=1996 |pmid=8901420 |doi= 10.1016/0168-9525(96)10014-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The length of DNA transferred during ''B. subtilis'' transformation can be as much as a third and up to the whole chromosome.&lt;ref name="pmid11388459"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akamatsu T, Taguchi H |title=Incorporation of the whole chromosomal DNA in protoplast lysates into competent cells of Bacillus subtilis |journal=Biosci.

===Archaea===

In several species of [[archaea]], mating is mediated by formation of cellular aggregates.
''[[Halobacterium]] volcanii'', an extreme [[Halophile|halophilic]] archaeon, forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear to be used for transfer of DNA from one cell to another in either direction.&lt;ref name="pmid2818746"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosenshine I, Tchelet R, Mevarech M |title=The mechanism of DNA transfer in the mating system of an archaebacterium |journal=Science |volume=245 |issue=4924 |pages=1387–9 |year=1989 |pmid=2818746 |doi= 10.1126/science.2818746|url=|bibcode=1989Sci...245.1387R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggregation in ''S. solfataricus'' could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift,&lt;ref name=Frol /&gt; suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage.  Ajon et al.&lt;ref name=Ajon /&gt; showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in ''S. acidocaldarius''.  Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude.  Frols et al.&lt;ref name=Frol /&gt; and Ajon et al.&lt;ref name=Ajon /&gt; hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA transfer between ''Sulfolobus'' cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of [[homologous recombination]]. This response appears to be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.&lt;ref name=Bernstein13&gt;Bernstein H and Bernstein C (2013).

===Protists===

Protists are a large group of diverse [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s, mainly [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] animals and plants, that do not form [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Eukaryotes emerged in evolution more than 1.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="pmid11452306"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Javaux EJ, Knoll AH, Walter MR |title=Morphological and ecological complexity in early eukaryotic ecosystems |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6842 |pages=66–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11452306 |doi=10.1038/35083562 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest eukaryotes were likely protists.  Mating and [[sexual reproduction]] are widespread among extant eukaryotes. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger&lt;ref name="pmid10229582"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dacks J, Roger AJ |title=The first sexual lineage and the relevance of facultative sex |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=779–83 |year=1999 |pmid=10229582 |doi= 10.1007/pl00013156|url=|bibcode=1999JMolE..48..779D }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes.

However, to many biologists it seemed unlikely until recently, that mating and sex could be a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes. A principal reason for this view was that mating and sex appeared to be lacking in certain [[pathogen]]ic protists whose ancestors branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree.  However, several of these protists are now known to be capable of, or to recently have had, the capability for [[meiosis]] and hence mating. To cite one example, the common intestinal parasite ''[[Giardia lamblia|Giardia intestinalis]]'' was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex.  However, ''G. intestinalis'' was recently found to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid15668177"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramesh MA, Malik SB, Logsdon JM |title=A phylogenomic inventory of meiotic genes; evidence for sex in Giardia and an early eukaryotic origin of meiosis |journal=Curr.

Furthermore, direct evidence for meiotic recombination, indicative of mating and sexual reproduction, was also found in ''G. intestinalis''.&lt;ref name="pmid17980591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper MA, Adam RD, Worobey M, Sterling CR |title=Population genetics provides evidence for recombination in Giardia |journal=Curr.

Protists generally reproduce asexually under favorable environmental conditions, but tend to reproduce sexually under stressful conditions, such as starvation or heat shock.&lt;ref name=Bernstein13 /&gt;

===Viruses===

Both animal viruses and bacterial viruses ([[bacteriophage]]) are able to undergo mating.  When a cell is mixedly infected by two genetically marked viruses, recombinant virus progeny are often observed indicating that mating interaction had occurred at the DNA level.  Another manifestation of mating between viral genomes is multiplicity reactivation (MR).  MR is the process by which at least two virus genomes, each containing inactivating genome damage, interact with each other in an infected cell to form viable progeny viruses.  The genes required for MR in bacteriophage T4 are largely the same as the genes required for allelic recombination.&lt;ref name="pmid6261109"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernstein C |title=Deoxyribonucleic acid repair in bacteriophage |journal=Microbiol. Rev. |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=72–98 |year=1981 |pmid=6261109 |pmc=281499 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of MR in animal viruses are described in the articles ''[[Herpes simplex virus]]'', ''[[Influenza A virus]]'', ''[[Adenoviridae]]'', ''[[Simian virus 40]]'', ''[[Vaccinia virus]]'', and ''[[Reoviridae]]''.

While the deity worshipped in the [[Suwa taisha|Grand Shrine of Suwa]] - most often called Suwa Myōjin (諏訪明神) - is nowadays usually identified with [[Takeminakata]], portrayed in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' as a son of [[Ōkuninushi]], the god of [[Izumo Province|Izumo]] who initially resisted the [[Kuni-yuzuri|transfer of sovereignty over the land of Japan]] from his father to [[Amaterasu]], the peculiar character of many of the religious rites of Suwa Shrine - specifically, that of the Upper Shrine (上社 ''Kamisha'') - seem to point to the cult of Suwa Myōjin as originally being a derivative of indigenous Mishaguji worship under Yamato rule. Takeminakata and/or his myth has been theorized by a number of modern scholars to be possibly based on this adaptation of local beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oowa"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ōwa|first1=Iwao|title=信濃古代史考 (Shinano Kodai Shikō)|date=1990|publisher=Meicho Shuppan|location=Tokyo|ISBN=978-4626013637|pages=212–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai|title=諏訪市史 上巻 原始・古代・中世 (Suwa-shi Shi (History of Suwa City), vol. 1: Genshi, Kodai, Chūsei)|date=1995|location=Suwa|pages=687–689|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/9572217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name has been variously interpreted as deriving from [[Dōsojin|''shakujin''/''ishigami'']] (石神 'stone god'), due to Mishaguji's association with stones and rocks, or ''[[Shaku (unit)|shakujin]]'' (尺神), due to another association with bamboo poles and measuring ropes used in [[surveying|land surveying]] and [[Boundary marker|boundary marking]].&lt;ref&gt;Ōwa (1990). pp. 189-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miyasaka24" /&gt; [[:ja:大和岩雄|Ōwa Iwao]] (1990), considering the above explanations unsatisfactory, instead opines the name to be ultimately derived from ''(mi)sakuchi'' (honorific prefix 御 ''mi-'' + 作霊, 咲霊 ''sakuchi''), a spirit (''chi''; cf. ''[[wikt:雷#Etymology 3|ikazu-chi]]'', ''[[Yamata no Orochi#Etymology|oro-chi]]'') that brings forth or opens up (''saku'', cf.

==Origin and extent of cult==

Worship of Mishaguji is thought to have originated in the area surrounding [[Lake Suwa]] from beliefs centering around the [[Mother Goddess|Earth Mother]] during the [[Jōmon period]].&lt;ref&gt;Oh (2011). pp. 155-156.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a total of 675 Mishaguji [[Shinto shrine|shrine]]s within Nagano Prefecture, 109 of which are in the Suwa region,{{efn|The modern municipalities of [[Chino, Nagano|Chino]], [[Suwa, Nagano|Suwa]], [[Okaya, Nagano|Okaya]], [[Shimosuwa, Nagano|Shimosuwa]], [[Fujimi, Nagano|Fujimi]], and [[Hara, Nagano|Hara]].}} the heartland of the Mishaguji cult.&lt;ref name="Owa199"&gt;Ōwa (1990). p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, traces of Mishaguji worship are found throughout the [[Kantō region|Kantō]] and [[Chūbu region]]s of Japan: shrines to the god(s) exist in areas such as [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]] (233 shrines), [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]] (229 shrines), [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]] (160 shrines), [[Mie Prefecture|Mie]] (140 shrines) and [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]] (116 shrines).&lt;ref name="Owa199" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka (2011). p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Mishaguji shrines are conspicuously absent in the two prefectures of [[Niigata Prefecture|Niigata]] and [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]], located to the north of Nagano.&lt;ref name="Owa199" /&gt;

Mishaguji were thought to dwell in various objects (''[[yorishiro]]''), the ''sekibō'' being one of them.]]
Mishaguji are believed to be spirits that [[Goshintai|dwell in]] rocks, trees, or bamboo leaves,&lt;ref name="Moriya" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanigawa193"&gt;Tanigawa (1987). p. 185, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various man-made objects such as [[Phallus|phallic]] stone rods ([[:ja:石棒|石棒]] ''sekibō''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis-Frédéric|title=Japan Encyclopedia|date=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674017535|page=838|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA838|translator-last=Roth|translator-first=Käthe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ouwehand|first1=Cornells|title=Namazu-e and Their Themes: An Interpretative Approach to Some Aspects of Japanese Folk Religion|date=1964|publisher=E.

Brill|location=Leiden|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1P4UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Sekibō'' worship in the Jōmon Period (縄文時代の石棒祭祀 ''Jōmon-jidai no sekibō-saishi'')|url=http://www.city.suwa.lg.jp/scm/dat/kikaku/data_files/html_dat/H11_isi/isi0203.htm|website=Suwa City Museum (諏訪市博物館)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metate|grinding slabs]] (石皿 ''ishizara'') or [[Mortar and pestle|mortars]] (石臼 ''ishiusu'').&lt;ref name="Owa191"&gt;Ōwa (1990). p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oh164"&gt;Oh (2011). p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the above, Mishaguji are also thought to descend upon straw effigies&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa (1987). pp. 180-181.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as possess human beings, especially during religious rituals.&lt;ref name="Owa191" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanigawa193" /&gt;

This concept of Mishaguji as a possessing spirit are reflected in texts that describe Mishaguji being 'brought down' (降申 ''oroshi-mōsu'', i.e. being summoned into a repository, whether human or object) or 'lifted up' (上申 ''age-mōsu'', i.e. being dismissed from its vessel) by the Moriya ''jinchōkan'', the priest with the exclusive right to call upon Mishaguji in the religious rites of the Suwa Grand Shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk beliefs considered Mishaguji to be associated with [[List of fertility deities|fertility]] and [[Vegetation deity|the harvest]],&lt;ref name="Oh164" /&gt; as well as healers of diseases like the [[common cold]] or [[pertussis]].&lt;ref name="daijiten802"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miyasaka25"&gt;Miyasaka (1987). p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Mishaguji have been worshipped as tutelary deities of whole villages (産土神 ''ubusuna-gami'') as well as specific kinship groups (祝神 ''iwai-gami'').&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Further reflecting this relationship between Mishaguji and local communities is their being believed to preside over the act of founding villages&lt;ref name="Miyasaka25" /&gt; as well as their being associated with the broadly similar concept of ''[[Dōsojin|saikami]]'' (patrons of boundaries or borders).&lt;ref name="soukou"/&gt;

==Mishaguji in Suwa==

Within the Suwa region, [[syncretism]] with other myths has resulted in the representation of Mishaguji as snakes, as well as their connection with the story of [[Takeminakata|Takeminakata-no-kami]] and Moreya-no-kami; Moreya-no-kami is said to represent the autochthonous worship of Mishaguji that syncretized with the worship of new gods represented by Takeminakata-no-kami.&lt;ref&gt;『東洋神名事典』p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|Ontōsai|御頭祭}}, sacred hunts of deer culminating in the sacrifice of the animal's head to the Mishaguji, were formerly carried out at shrines such as Misayama Shrine in Suwa. In the modern era, these hunts have generally been replaced by a ceremony incorporating an artificial stuffed deer head.&lt;ref name="akuma"&gt;『悪魔事典』pp. 184-185, 282-283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;『太陽の地図帳 楽しい古墳案内』 監修[[松木武彦]] [[平凡社]] 2014年 {{ISBN|978-4-582-94560-7}} p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UNMSM museo historianatural.jpg|thumb|280px|Natural History Museum of the [[National University of San Marcos]].]]
The '''Natural History Museum''' (Museo de Historia Natural) in Lima, is Peru's most important museum of natural history. It was established in 1918 and belongs to the [[National University of San Marcos]].

The present director is Dr. [[Betty Millán]].

==History==
The museum was founded in 1918 by the Faculty of Sciences of the [[Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos]]. The first director and founder of the museum was [[Carlos Rospigliosi]].

The initial personal of the museum consisted in one curator in chief, and three curators for the areas of [[Zoology]], [[Botany]] and [[Mineralogy]].

The first scientific expedition was organized by Rospigliosi in April 1918, that collected specimens of [[fauna]], [[flora]] and minerals from the departments of [[Junín Region|Junín]] and [[Huánuco Region|Huánuco]]. The second expedition was organized by the [[Geographic Society of Lima]] in 1920 that included the participation of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] geologist and explorer [[Otto Nordenskiöld]]. This expedition explored the highlands and foothills of the [[Andes]] in the department of Junín.

In 1920, the rector of the [[National University of San Marcos]], Dr. [[Javier Prado]], interceded in order to acquire the collections of [[Antonio Raimondi]] for the recently created museum. These samples included zoological, botanical and mineralogical specimens.

==The building==
Originally, the museum was located at the Faculty of [[Humanities]] and [[Social Sciences]] at the campus in ''Parque Universitario''. In 1934, it moved to its current location on ''Av. Arenales'' 1256, ''Jesús María'' in [[Lima]], [[Peru]].

==The collections==
The museum is repository of representative specimens of Peruvian fauna, flora and minerals, including exhibitions of [[mammal]]s, [[primate]]s, [[invertebrate]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fossil]]s, [[dinosaur]]s, [[fish]] and [[mineral]]s.

Highlights of the collections include:
*Skeletons of a [[sperm whale]]
*Fossils of South American horses
*Fossils of giant ground [[sloth]]s

==Publications==
The first publication series was the ''Boletín del Museo de Historia Natural'' in 1937 aimed to divulge institutional activities and results of scientific research. The ''Publicaciones del Museo'' series in [[Zoology]], [[Botany]] and [[Geology]] were published from 1948, the ''Memorias del Museo'' in 1951 and the ''Serie de Divulgación'' in 1964.

==Directors==
Since its foundation, the direction of the museum has been responsibility of the following researchers:

*Dr. [[Carlos Rospigliosi Vigil|Carlos Rospigliosi]] (1918–1938)
*Dr. [[Carlos Morales Macedo|Carlos Morales]] (1938–1947)
*Dr. [[Jehan Vellard]] (1947–1956)
*Ing. [[Bernardo Boit]] (1956–1961)
*Dr. [[Ramón Ferreyra Huerta|Ramón Ferreyra]] (1961–1981)
*Dr. [[Hernando de Macedo Ruiz|Hernando de Macedo]] (1981–1985)

'''Neutron activation''' is the process in which [[neutron radiation]] [[induced radioactivity|induces]] [[radioactivity]] in materials, and occurs when [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] capture [[free neutron]]s, becoming heavier and entering [[excited state]]s. The excited nucleus often decays immediately by emitting [[gamma rays]], or particles such as [[beta decay|beta particles]], [[alpha particle]]s, [[fission products]], and neutrons (in [[nuclear fission]]). Thus, the process of [[neutron capture]], even after any intermediate decay, often results in the formation of an unstable [[activation product]]. Such radioactive nuclei can exhibit [[half-life|half-lives]] ranging from small fractions of a second to many years.

Neutron activation is the only common way that a stable material can be induced into becoming intrinsically radioactive. All naturally occurring materials, including air, water, and soil, can be induced (activated) by neutron capture into some amount of radioactivity in varying degrees, as a result of production of neutron-rich radioisotopes. Some atoms require more than one neutron to become unstable, which makes them harder to activate because the probability of a double or triple capture by a nucleus is below that of single capture. Water, for example, is made up of hydrogen and oxygen. [[Hydrogen]] requires a double capture to attain instability as [[isotopes of hydrogen|hydrogen-3]], [[tritium]], while natural [[oxygen]] (oxygen-16) requires three captures to become unstable [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen-19]]. Thus water is relatively difficult to activate, as compared to [[sodium chloride|sea salt]] ([[sodium|Na]][[chlorine|Cl]]), in which both the sodium and chlorine ions become unstable with a single capture each. These facts were realized first-hand at the ''[[Operation Crossroads]]'' atomic test series in 1946.

==Examples==
{{Main|Neutron capture}}
An example of this kind of a nuclear reaction occurs in the production of [[cobalt-60]] within a [[nuclear reactor]]:
:{{nuclide|cobalt|59|link=yes}} + {{Subatomic particle|10neutron|link=yes}} → {{nuclide|cobalt|60|link=yes}}

The cobalt-60 then decays by the emission of a [[beta particle]] plus [[gamma ray]]s into [[nickel]]-60. This reaction has a half-life of about 5.27 years; and due to the availability of [[cobalt-59]] (100% of its [[natural abundance]]) this neutron bombarded isotope of [[cobalt]] is a valuable source of [[nuclear radiation]] (namely gamma radiation) for [[radiotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_1340_web.pdf Manual for reactor produced radioisotopes] from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, and depending on the [[kinetic energy]] of the neutron, the capture of a neutron can cause [[nuclear fission]]—the splitting of the atomic nucleus into two smaller nuclei. If the fission requires an input of energy, that comes from the kinetic energy of the neutron. An example of this kind of fission in a light element can occur when the stable isotope of [[lithium]], [[lithium-7]], is bombarded with fast neutrons and undergoes the following nuclear reaction:
:{{nuclide|lithium|7|link=yes}} + {{Subatomic particle|10neutron|link=yes}} → {{nuclide|helium|4|link=yes}} + {{nuclide|hydrogen|3|link=yes}} + {{Subatomic particle|10neutron}} + [[gamma ray]]s + [[kinetic energy]]

In other words, the capture of a neutron by lithium-7 causes it to split into an energetic [[helium]] nucleus ([[alpha particle]]), a [[hydrogen-3]] ([[tritium]]) nucleus and a free neutron. The [[Castle Bravo]] accident, in which the thermonuclear bomb test at [[Enewetak Atoll]] in 1954 exploded with 2.5 times the expected yield, was caused by the unexpectedly high probability of this reaction.

In the areas around a [[pressurized water reactor]]s or [[boiling water reactor]]s during normal operation, a significant amount of radiation is produced due to the [[fast neutron]] activation of coolant water oxygen via a [[Np reaction|(n,p) reaction]]. The activated oxygen-16 nucleus emits a proton (hydrogen nucleus), and transmutes to nitrogen-16, which has a very short life (7.13 seconds) before decaying back to oxygen-16 (emitting 6.13MeV beta particles).&lt;ref name="Neeb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Neeb|first= Karl Heinz |title=The Radiochemistry of Nuclear Power Plants with Light Water Reactors|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin-New York|date=1997|isbn=3-11-013242-7| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SJOE00whg44C&amp;pg=PA227| page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{nuclide|oxygen|16|link=yes}} + {{Subatomic particle|10neutron|link=yes}} → {{Subatomic particle|11proton|link=yes}} + {{nuclide|nitrogen|16|link=yes}} (Decays rapidly)
:{{nuclide|nitrogen|16}} → {{Subatomic particle|gamma|link=yes}} + {{Physics particle|e|TL=0|BL=-1|TR=-|link=electron}} + {{nuclide|oxygen|16}}

This activation of the coolant water requires extra [[biological shield]]ing around the nuclear reactor plant. It is the high energy gamma ray in the second reaction that causes the major concern. This is why water that has recently been inside a nuclear reactor core must be shielded until this radiation subsides. One to two minutes is generally sufficient.

==Occurrence==
Neutron activation is the only common way that a stable material can be induced into becoming intrinsically radioactive. Neutrons are only free in quantity in the microseconds of a nuclear weapon's explosion, in an active nuclear reactor, or in a [[spallation]] neutron source.

In an atomic weapon neutrons are only generated for from 1 to 50 microseconds, but in huge numbers. Most are absorbed by the metallic bomb casing, which is only just starting to be affected by the explosion within it. The neutron activation of the soon-to-be vaporized metal is responsible for a significant portion of the [[nuclear fallout]] in nuclear bursts high in the atmosphere. In other types of activation neutrons may irradiate soil that is dispersed in a mushroom cloud at or near the Earth's surface, resulting in fallout from activation of soil chemical elements.

==Effects on materials over time==
In any location with high [[neutron flux]]es, such as within the cores of nuclear reactors, neutron activation contributes to material erosion; periodically the lining materials themselves must be disposed of, as low-level [[radioactive waste]]. Some materials are more subject to neutron activation than others, so a suitably chosen low-activation material can significantly reduce this problem (see [[International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility]]). For example, [[isotopes of chromium|Chromium-51]] will form by neutron activation in [[chrome steel]] (which contains Cr-50) that is exposed to a typical reactor neutron flux.&lt;ref&gt;http://ie.lbl.gov/toi/nuclide.asp?iZA=240051&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon-14]], most frequently but not solely, generated by the neutron activation of atmospheric nitrogen-14 with [[thermal neutron]], is (together with its dominant natural production pathway from cosmic ray-air interactions and historical production from [[nuclear testing|atmospheric nuclear testing]]) also generated in comparatively minute amounts inside many designs of nuclear reactors which contain nitrogen gas impurities in their [[fuel cladding]], [[coolant water]] and by neutron activation of the oxygen contained in the water itself. [[Fast breeder reactor]]s (FBR) produce about an order of magnitude less C-14 than the most common reactor type, the [[pressurized water reactor]], as FBRs do not use water as a primary coolant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/TRS421_web.pdf |title=IAEA Technical report series no.421, Management of Waste Containing Tritium and Carbon-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Radiation safety===
For physicians and radiation safety officers, activation of sodium in the human body to sodium-24, and phosphorus to phosphorus-32, can give a good immediate estimate of acute accidental neutron exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ornl.gov/info/reports/1993/3445603755103.pdf ORNL Report] on determination of dose from criticality accidents&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neutron detection====
One way to demonstrate that [[nuclear fusion]] has occurred inside a [[fusor|fusor device]] is to use a [[Geiger counter]] to measure the gamma ray radioactivity that is produced from a sheet of [[aluminium foil]].

In the [[inertial confinement fusion|ICF]] fusion approach, the fusion yield of the experiment (directly proportional to neutron production) is usually determined by measuring the gamma-ray emissions of aluminium or copper neutron activation targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geneseo.edu/nuclear/aluminum-activation-results |title=DT neutron yield measurements using neutron activation of aluminum|author1=Stephen Padalino |author2=Heather Oliver |author3=Joel Nyquist |others= LLE Collaborators: Vladimir Smalyukand, Nancy Rogers |lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium can capture a neutron and generate radioactive [[sodium-24]], which has a half life of 15 hours&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full/2001/10/aah2362/node4.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://kubchemistry.weebly.com/uploads/6/9/8/7/6987088/chapter_22_nuclear_reactions.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; and a beta decay energy of 5.514 MeV.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.site.uottawa.ca:4321/astronomy/index.html#sodium24 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705214728/http://www.site.uottawa.ca:4321/astronomy/index.html |date=2006-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The activation of a number of test target elements such as [[sulfur]], copper, [[tantalum]], and [[gold]] have been used to determine the yield of both [[pure fission weapon|pure fission]]&lt;ref name=Kerr2005&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.rerf.or.jp/shared/ds02/pdf/chapter01/cha01-p42-61.pdf |chapter=Bomb Parameters |last1=Kerr |first1=George D. |last2=Young |first2=Robert W. |last3=Cullings |first3=Harry M. |last4=Christy |first4=Robert F. |pages=42–43 |title=Reassessment of the Atomic Bomb Radiation Dosimetry for Hiroshima and Nagasaki – Dosimetry System 2002 |year=2005 |publisher=The Radiation Effects Research Foundation |editor=Robert W.

====Materials analysis====
{{Main|Neutron activation analysis}}
[[Neutron activation analysis]] is one of the most sensitive and accurate methods of trace element analysis. It requires no sample preparation or solubilization and can therefore be applied to objects that need to be kept intact such as a valuable piece of art. Although the activation induces radioactivity in the object, its level is typically low and its lifetime may be short, so that its effects soon disappear. In this sense, neutron activation is a non-destructive analysis method.

Neutron activation analysis can be done in situ. For example, aluminium (Al-27) can be activated by capturing relatively low-energy neutrons to produce the [[isotopes of aluminium|isotope Al-28]], which decays with a half-life of 2.3 minutes with a decay energy of 4.642 MeV.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.site.uottawa.ca:4321/astronomy/index.html#aluminium28 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705214728/http://www.site.uottawa.ca:4321/astronomy/index.html |date=2006-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This activated isotope is used in oil drilling to determine the [[phyllosilicate#Phyllosilicates|clay]] content (clay is generally an [[alumino-silicate]]) of the underground area under exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms.aspx?LookIn=term%20name&amp;filter=aluminum%20activation%20log |title=Aluminum activation log}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians can use accidental neutron activation to authenticate atomic artifacts and materials subjected to neutron fluxes from fission incidents. For example, one of the fairly unique isotopes found in [[trinitite]], and therefore with its absence likely signifying a fake sample of the mineral, is a barium neutron activation product, the [[barium]] in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity device]] coming from the [[detonation velocity|slow explosive]] [[explosive lens|lens]] employed in the device, known as [[Baratol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Radioactivity in Trinitite six decades later |doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.01.017 |volume=85 |issue=1 |journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity |pages=103–120 |pmid=16102878 |year=2006 |last1=Parekh |first1=PP |last2=Semkow |first2=TM |last3=Torres |first3=MA |last4=Haines |first4=DK |last5=Cooper |first5=JM |last6=Rosenberga |first6=PM |last7=Kittoa |first7=ME}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pearce Estate Wetland''' is a [[urban park|city park]] located in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]].  The park occupies 21 hectares (52 acres, 0.21 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) along the [[Bow River]] to the east of [[downtown Calgary]].  It is described as "[[constructed wetland]]s filled with native plants and animals".

Setts are usually made of [[granite]].

==Places==
Places paved with setts include many streets in [[Rome]] and elsewhere in [[Italy]] (where blocks are called ''[[sampietrini]]'' or ''bolognini''), since the technique was first used by [[Romans]], in Aberdeen (Scotland), much of Edinburgh's [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] and [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], and [[Red Square]] in [[Moscow]].
[[File:Eden Street Silloth on Solway.jpg|thumb|The setts at the junction of Eden Street and Criffel Street in Silloth on Solway, Cumbria UK]]
[[Silloth on Solway]], the seaside town in [[Cumbria]], still has the setts (originally laid in the 19th century) on Eden St and the seafront Criffel Street. Streets paved with setts feature in cycling competitions including the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-p1rjWWcfQ&amp;feature=youtu.be "Tour of Britain" which visited Silloth on Solway in 2015.]

In [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]], most roads are in Belgian block in the center, but in the recent years, a lot of them have been replaced by asphalt to reduce noise.

In New York City, the [[West Village]] (including the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]]) and [[SoHo]] neighborhoods retain such streets. Older sections of [[Brooklyn]] such as [[Dumbo, Brooklyn|DUMBO]] and surrounding neighborhoods also have streets bearing Belgian blocks.

Germantown Avenue in [[Philadelphia]], in particular its upper reaches through [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]], [[Mount Airy, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Mount Airy]] and [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Chestnut Hill]], is notable for being paved with Belgian blocks; repaving projects on this thoroughfare have retained or reintroduced setts to give additional historic character to these neighborhoods. Part of this character includes the tracks of the [[SEPTA Route 23|23 trolley]], though the modern tracks are encased in concrete slabs rather than setts, and the trolley line itself is currently operated by buses.

In [[Richmond, Virginia]] Belgian block streets are particularly common, most notably in [[Shockoe Slip]]. Street cars traveled through the street on tracks that are still visible though the system has been replaced by buses.

The [[Fells Point]] neighborhood of [[Baltimore]] also has Belgian block streets.

In many cities besides Richmond and Philadelphia setts have often been used for pavement around street-running [[tram|trolley or tram lines]] in the same manner as [[brickwork]].

[[Portland, Oregon]], used Belgian block paving extensively in the 19th century, starting near the Willamette River, to stop the streets from washing away in floods. Many streets in older parts of the city are underlain by these blocks, and a few streets in the [[Pearl District]] still feature this kind of pavement.  The City of Portland stockpiles these blocks when they are dug up for street or utility repairs or renovation. They have been used between the rails in some of [[TriMet]]'s MAX light rail lines to warn automobile drivers that they are driving on light rail right of way. The romantic claim that old Portland "cobbles" were imported as ship's [[ballast]] is incorrect; they are local [[basalt]], quarried near St. Helens in Oregon.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Cycling==
Streets paved with setts (French: ''pavé'') are highlights in several cycling competitions such as the final [[Champs-Élysées stage in Tour de France|Champs-Élysées]] stage of the [[Tour de France]] and the [[Paris–Roubaix]] road race. Riding upon sett is more technically challenging than riding on asphalt.

A '''solar-assisted heat pump''' ('''SAHP''') is a machine that represents the integration of a [[heat pump]] and [[Solar thermal collector|thermal solar panels]] in a single integrated system. Typically these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce [[Water heating|hot water]].&lt;ref name = ref1&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bine.info/en/publications/themeninfos/publikation/elektrisch-angetriebene-waermepumpen/waermepumpen-plus-solar/ | title = Solar-assisted heat pumps | language = en | access-date = 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.climatizzazioneconfontirinnovabili.enea.it/index.php/pompe-di-calore-elioassistite | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120107065814/http://climatizzazioneconfontirinnovabili.enea.it/index.php/pompe-di-calore-elioassistite | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 7 January 2012 | title = Pompe di calore elio-assistite | language = it | access-date = 21 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this system is to get high [[Coefficient of performance|COP]] and then produce energy in a more [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficient]] and less expensive way.

It is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel (sheet and tubes, roll-bond, heat pipe, thermal plates) or [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector|hybrid]] ([[Mono-crystalline silicon|mono]]/[[Polycrystalline silicon|polycrystalline]], [[Thin-film solar cell|thin film]]) in combination with the heat pump. The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows covering a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the [[variable cost]]s of the system.

== Optimization ==
The operating conditions' optimization of this system is the main problem, because there are two opposing trends of the performance of the two sub-systems: by way of example, a decreasing of the evaporation temperature of the [[Refrigerant|working fluid]] generates an increasing of the thermal efficiency of the solar panel but a decreasing in the performance of the heat pump, with a decreasing in the COP.&lt;ref name = ref3&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/15682/1/SISTEMI%20A%20POMPA%20DI%20CALORE%20ELIOASSISTITA%20MODELLO%20DI%20SIMULAZIONE%20IN%20AMBIENTE%20TRNSYS%20E%20CONFRONTO%20ENERGETICO%20DI%20CONFIGURAZIONI%20IMPIANTISTICHE-%20FLOREANO%20STEFANO%20LUIGI%2cFALLINI%20NICOLA.pdf | title = Sistemi a pompa di calore elioassistita: modello di simulazione in ambiente TRNSYS e confronto energetico di configurazioni impiantistiche | author = Nicola Fallini | author2 = Stefano Luigi Floreano | language = it | date =  31 March 2011 | access-date = 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target for the optimization is normally the minimization of the electrical consumption of the heat pump, or [[primary energy]] required by an [[Boiler|auxiliary boiler]] which supplies the load not covered by [[Renewable energy|renewable source]].

== Configurations ==
There are two possible configurations of this system, which are distinguished by the presence or not of an intermediate fluid that transports the heat from the panel to the heat pump. Machines called indirect-
expansion mainly use [[water]] as a heat transfer fluid, mixed with an antifreeze fluid (usually [[Ethylene glycol|glycol]]) to avoid [[ice]] formation phenomena during winter period. The machines called direct-expansion place the refrigerant fluid directly inside the hydraulic circuit of the thermal panel, where the [[phase transition]] takes place.&lt;ref name = ref3 /&gt; This second configuration, even though it is more complex from a technical point of view, has several advantages:&lt;ref name = ref4&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jie | first1 = Jia | last2 = Hanfeng | first2 = Hea | last3 = Tin-tai | first3 = Chowb | last4 = Gang | first4 = Peia | last5 = Wei | first5 = Hea | last6 = Keliang | first6 = Liua | year = 2009 | title = Distributed dynamic modeling and experimental study of PV evaporator in a PV/T solar-assisted heat pump | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931008005206 | journal = International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer | volume = 52 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 1365–1373 | doi=10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2008.08.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ref5&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jie | first1 = Jia | last2 = Gang | first2 = Peia | last3 = Tin-tai | first3 = Chowb | last4 = Keliang | first4 = Liua | last5 = Hanfeng | first5 = Hea | last6 = Jianping | first6 = Lua | last7 = Chongwei | first7 = Hana | year = 2007 | title = Experimental study of photovoltaic solar assisted heat pump system | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X07000837 | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–52 | doi=10.1016/j.solener.2007.04.006| bibcode = 2008SoEn...82...43J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a better transfer of the heat produced by the thermal panel to the working fluid which involves a greater thermal efficiency of the evaporator, linked to the absence of an intermediate fluid;
* presence of an evaporating fluid allows a uniform temperature distribution in the thermal panel with a consequent increase in the thermal efficiency (in normal operating conditions of the solar panel, the local thermal efficiency decreases from inlet to outlet of the fluid because the fluid temperature increases);
* using hybrid solar panel, in addition to the advantage described in the previous point, the [[Photovoltaics#Efficiency|electrical efficiency]] of the panel increases (for similar considerations).

== Comparison ==
Generally speaking the use of this integrated system is an efficient way to employ the heat produced by the thermal panels in winter period, something that normally wouldn't be exploited because its temperature is too low.&lt;ref name = ref2 /&gt;

=== Separated production systems ===
In comparison with only heat pump utilization, it is possible to reduce the amount of electrical energy consumed by the machine during the weather evolution from winter season to the spring, and then finally only use thermal solar panels to produce all the heat demand required (only in case of indirect-expansion machine), thus saving on variable costs.&lt;ref name = ref1 /&gt;

In comparison with a system with only thermal panels, it is possible to provide a greater part of the required winter heating using a non-fossil energy source.&lt;ref name = ref6&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuang | first1 = Y.H. | last2 = Wang | first2 = R.Z. | year = 2006 | title = Performance of a multi-functional direct-expansion solar assisted heat pump system | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X05002215 | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 80 | issue = 7 | pages = 795–803 | doi=10.1016/j.solener.2005.06.003| bibcode = 2006SoEn...80..795K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional heat pumps ===
Compared to [[geothermal heat pump]]s, the main advantage is that the installation of a piping field in the soil is not required, which results in a lower cost of investment (drilling accounts for about 50% of the cost of a geothermal heat pump system) and in more flexibility of machine installation, even in areas in which there is limited available space. Furthermore, there are no risks related to possible thermal soil impoverishment.&lt;ref name = ref7&gt;{{cite book | first = Attilio | last = Carotti | title = Edifici a elevate prestazioni energetiche e acustiche. Energy management | language = it | year = 2014 | editor = WOLTERS KLUWER ITALIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similarly to [[air source heat pumps]], solar-assisted heat pump performance is affected by atmospheric conditions, although this effect is less significant.  Solar-assisted heat pump performance is generally affected by varying [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]] intensity rather than [[Atmospheric temperature|air temperature]] oscillation. This produces a greater SCOP (Seasonal COP). Additionally, evaporation temperature of the working fluid is higher than in air source heat pumps, so in general the coefficient of performance is significantly higher.&lt;ref name = ref4 /&gt;

== Low temperature conditions ==
In general, a heat pump can evaporate at temperatures below the ambient temperature. In a solar-assisted heat pump this generates a temperature distribution of the thermal panels below that temperature. In this condition thermal losses of the panels towards the environment become additional available energy to the heat pump.&lt;ref name = ref8&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huang | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Chyng | first2 = J.P. | year = 2001 | title = Performance characteristics of integral type solar-assisted heat pump | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X01000767 | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 71 | issue = 6 | pages = 403–414 | doi=10.1016/S0038-092X(01)00076-7| bibcode = 2001SoEn...71..403H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ref9&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.solaretermodinamico.info/thermboil.php | title = Thermboil - Pannelli termodinamici | language = it | access-date = 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case it is possible that the thermal efficiency of solar panels is more than 100%.

Another free-contribution in these conditions of low temperature is related to the possibility of [[condensation]] of water vapor on the surface of the panels, which provides additional heat to the heat transfer fluid (normally it is a small part of the total heat collected by solar panels), that is equal to the [[latent heat]] of condensation.

== Heat pump with double cold sources ==
The simple configuration of solar-assisted heat pump as only solar panels as heat source for the evaporator. It can also exist a configuration with an additional heat source.&lt;ref name = ref1 /&gt; The goal is to have further advantages in energy saving but, on the other hand, the management and optimization of the system become more complex.

The geothermal-solar configuration allows reducing the size of the piping field (and reduce the investment) and to have a regeneration of the ground during summer through the heat collected from the thermal panels.

The air-solar structure allows an acceptable heat input also during cloudy days, maintaining the compactness of the system and the easiness to install it.

'''Three-dimensional quartz phenolic''' ('''3DQP''')&lt;ref&gt;Public Record Office, London. TNA PREM 15-1359&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Phenolic resin|phenolic]]-based material composed of a [[quartz]] cloth material impregnated with a phenolic [[resin]] and hot-pressed. When cured, 3DQP can be [[Lathe|machined]] in the same way as metals and is tough and fire-resistant. 3DQP is used for the manufacture of [[nuclear weapon]] [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entry vehicles]] (RV).

The quartz material '[[electromagnetic pulse|hardens]]' the RV protecting the nuclear warhead against high-energy [[neutron]]s emitted by exo-atmospheric [[Anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) bursts before re-entry.&lt;ref&gt;Public Record Office, London. TNA CAB 168/27&lt;/ref&gt;

3DQP was first used on the British [[Chevaline]] '''improved front end''' ('''IFE''') for the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[UGM-27 Polaris]] system that was in service from 1982 to 1996, when it was replaced by [[Trident D5]].

==Manufacture==
A licence to manufacture 3DQP in the US was acquired from the British Government and production was undertaken by [[Avco|AVCO]], one of the two suppliers of US RVs, the other being [[General Electric]]. First production examples of the Chevaline ReBs were manufactured by AVCO, now part of [[Textron]]. Subsequently, production was undertaken in the UK at the Royal Ordnance Factory Burghfield using quartz material purchased from France.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives, London. TNA AVIA 65/2037, declassified 20 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Documents declassified in 2013 describe in some detail the process whereby a quartz two-dimensional cloth is hand woven from quartz threads with conventional wefts and warps within a stainless steel matrix before being impregnated under pressure with a phenolic resin. A third dimension was then woven through the cavities created by removal of the stainless steel matrix before these threads were impregnated with phenolic resin inside an autoclave pressurised at up to 2000 psi. The resulting material was then [[Lathe|lathe-turned]] to the ReB profile, internally and externally.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives, London. TNA AVIA 65/2037, declassified 20 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The supply by AVCO of test samples of 3DQP to France without UK permission caused friction between the British Government and AVCO, and action in the US courts by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Public Record Office, London. TNA DEFE 24/896&lt;/ref&gt;

In Great Britain just before [[World War I]] there were 24 million adult women and 1.7 million worked in [[domestic service]], 800,000 worked in the [[textile manufacturing]] industry, 600,000 worked in the clothing trades, 500,000 worked in commerce, and 260,000 worked in local and national government, including teaching.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;[[R.J.Q. Adams|Adams, R.J.Q.]] (1978). ''Arms and the Wizard. [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and the [[Ministry of Munitions]] 1915 - 1916'', London: Cassell &amp; Co Ltd. {{ISBN|0-304-29916-2}}. Particularly, Chapter 8: ''The Women's Part''.&lt;/ref&gt; The British textile and clothing trades, in particular, employed far more women than men and were regarded as 'women's work'.&lt;ref name = adams/&gt;

While some women managed to enter the traditionally male career paths, women, for the most part, were expected to be primarily involved in "duties at home" and "women's work". Before 1914, only a few countries, including New Zealand, Australia, and several [[Scandinavia]]n nations, had given women the right to vote (see [[Women's suffrage]]), but otherwise, women were minimally involved in the political process.

The two world wars hinged as much on industrial production as they did on battlefield clashes. With millions of men away fighting and with the inevitable casualties, there was a severe shortage of labour in a range of industries, from rural and farm work to urban office jobs.

During both world wars women were needed by the national war effort to undertake new roles.&lt;ref name = adams/&gt; In Great Britain, this was known as a process of "Dilution" and was strongly contested by the [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade unions]], particularly in the engineering and [[ship building]] industries.&lt;ref name = adams/&gt; For the duration of both World Wars, women sometimes did take on skilled "men's work".&lt;ref name = adams/&gt; However, in accordance with the agreement negotiated with the trade unions, women undertaking jobs covered by the Dilution agreement lost their jobs at the end of the First World War.&lt;ref name = adams/&gt;

By 1914 nearly 5.09 million out of the 23.8 million women in Britain were working. Thousands worked in [[Filling Factories|munitions factories]] (see [[Canary girl]]), offices and large hangars used to build aircraft.&lt;ref name = adams/&gt; Women were also involved in knitting socks for the soldiers on the front, as well as other voluntary work, but as a matter of survival women had to work for paid employment for the sake of their families. Many women worked as volunteers serving at the [[Red Cross]], encouraged the sale of [[war bond]]s or planted "[[victory garden]]s".

Not only did women have to keep "the home fires burning" but they took on voluntary and paid employment that was diverse in scope and showed that women were capable in diverse fields of endeavour. There is little doubt this expanded the view of the role of women in society and changed the outlook of what women could do and their place in the workforce. Although women were still paid less than men in the workforce, pay inequalities were starting to diminish as women were now getting paid two-thirds of the typical pay for men, a 28% increase. However, the extent of this change is open to historical debate. In part because of female participation in the war effort Canada, the United States, Great Britain, and a number of European countries extended [[suffrage]] to women in the years after the First World War.

British historians {{why?|date=July 2016}} no longer emphasize the granting of woman suffrage as a reward for women's participation in war work. Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganizing effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Martin D. Pugh, "Politicians and the Woman's Vote 1914-1918," ''History,'' October 1974, Vol. 59 Issue 197, pp 358-374&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, [[G. R. Searle]] (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers. Women in Britain finally achieved suffrage on the same terms as men in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. R. Searle]], ''A New England? Peace and war, 1886-1918'' (2004) p 791&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service===
[[Nursing]] became almost the only area of female contribution that involved being at the front and experiencing the war. In Britain the [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps]], [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] and [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] were all started before World War I. The VADs were not allowed in the front line until 1915. By 1916, the FANY began to work for the British Army as ambulance convoy drivers and, later that same year, the VAD started their own ambulance convoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardianpromenade.com/war/wwi-wednesday-women-ambulance-drivers/|title=WWI Wednesday: The Women Who Drove Ambulances on the Western Front|last=Hadley Jones|first=Camille|date=October 2, 2013|publisher=Edwardian Promenade|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 12,000 women enlisted in auxiliary roles in the United States Navy and Marine Corps during the First World War. About 400 of them died in that war.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |work=CBC News |title=Women in the military — international|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817105107/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |date=May 30, 2006|archivedate=August 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 2,800 women served with the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps during the First World War and it was during that era that the role of Canadian women in the military first extended beyond nursing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnmilitary/women-cdnmilitary.html |work=CBC News |title=Women in the Canadian military |date=30 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821093151/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnmilitary/women-cdnmilitary.html |archivedate=August 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were given paramilitary training in small arms, drill, first aid and vehicle maintenance in case they were needed as home guards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Forty-three women in the Canadian military died during WWI.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The only belligerent to deploy female combat troops in substantial numbers was the [[Russian Provisional Government]] in 1917. Its few "[[Women's Battalion]]s" fought well, but failed to provide the propaganda value expected of them and were disbanded before the end of the year. In the later [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Bolsheviks]] would also employ women infantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reese|first=Roger R.|title=The Soviet military experience: a history of the Soviet Army, 1917–1991|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2000|page=17|isbn=0-415-21719-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1918 [[Finnish Civil War]], more than 2,000 women fought in the paramilitary [[Women's Red Guards of the Finnish Civil War|Women's Red Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lintunen|first=Tiina|date=2014|title=The Finnish Civil War 1918: History, Memory, Legacy|chapter=Women at War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xCJBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=fi&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill Publishers|pages=201–229|isbn=978-900-42436-6-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
{{main article|Women in World War II}}
[[File:Victory job (AWM ARTV00332).jpg|thumb|In many nations women were encouraged to join female branches of the armed forces or participate in industrial or farm work.]]
===United States===
Women in World War II took on a variety of roles from country to country. World War II involved global conflict on an unprecedented scale; the absolute urgency of mobilizing the entire population made the expansion of the role of women inevitable. The hard skilled labor of women was symbolized in the United States by the concept of Rosie the Riveter, a woman factory laborer performing what was previously considered man's work.

With this expanded horizon of opportunity and confidence, and with the extended skill base that many women could now give to paid and voluntary employment, women's roles in World War II were even more extensive than in the First World War. By 1945, more than 2.2 million women were working in war industries, especially in munitions plants. They participated in the building of ships, aircraft, vehicles, and weaponry. Women also worked on farms, drove trucks, provided logistic support for soldiers and entered professional areas of work that were previously the preserve of men. In the Allied countries thousands of women enlisted as nurses serving in the front line units. Thousands of others joined defensive militias at home and there was a great increase in the number of women serving for the military itself, particularly in the Soviet Union's Red Army.

During World War II, approximately 400,000 U.S. women served in support positions with the armed forces and more than 460 — some sources say the figure is closer to 543 — lost their lives as a result of the war, including 16 from enemy fire. Women became officially recognized as a permanent part of the U.S. armed forces after the war with the passing of the [[Women's Armed Services Integration Act]] of 1948.

The ability for women to be involved overseas opened doors for many underrepresented groups, including [[Latinas and World War II|Latinas]], to serve their country.
===Europe===
Several hundred thousand women in countries such as England, Soviet Union, served in combat roles, especially in anti-aircraft units. The U.S. decided not to use women in combat because public opinion would not tolerate it. 

Germany had presented an ideal female role at home, but the urgent need for war production led to the hiring of millions of German women for factory and office work.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Hagemann, "Mobilizing Women for War: The History, Historiography, and Memory of German Women’s War Service in the Two World Wars," ''Journal of Military History'' 75:3 (2011): 1055-1093&lt;/ref&gt;

Many women served in the resistances of Yugoslavia, Poland, France, and Italy, and in the British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] and American [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] which aided these.

Approximately 2 million [[Jewish women in the Holocaust]] were killed, and the Nazis also killed other women who belonged to groups they were committing genocide against, such as women with disabilities and [[Romani people|Roma]] women.

===Asia and Pacific===
Women, called [[comfort women]], were forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II. Korean women were especially used.&lt;ref&gt;George Hicks, ''The Comfort Women: Japan's brutal regime of enforced prostitution in the Second World War'' (WW Norton &amp; Company, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

But a far greater number of women worked in war industry than in sex slavery. Women in Japan and Korea also performed industrial labor duties during the war. They helped make bombs and guns and airplanes, etc.

====Australia====
{{main|Australian women during World War II}}
Australian women during World War II played a larger role than they had during [[Australian women in World War I|The First World War]], when they primarily served as nurses and additional homefront workers. Many women wanted to play an active role in the war, and hundreds of voluntary women's auxiliary and paramilitary organisations had been formed by 1940. A shortage of male recruits forced the military to establish female branches in 1941 and 1942. Women entered roles which had traditionally been limited to men, but continued to receive lower wages.&lt;ref&gt;Patsy Adam-Smith, ''Australian Women At War'' (Penguin, Melbourne, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{main article|Canadian women in the World Wars}}
Canadian women in the World Wars became indispensable because the World Wars were [[total war]]s that required the maximum effort of the civilian population. While Canadians were deeply divided on the issue of conscription for men, there was wide agreement that women had important new roles to play in the home, in civic life, in industry, in nursing, and even in military uniforms. Historians debate whether there was much long-term impact on the postwar roles of women.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Bruce, ''Back the Attack!: Canadian Women During the Second World War, at Home and Abroad'' (Macmillan of Canada, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;
