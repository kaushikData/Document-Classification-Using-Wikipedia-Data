The '''Bulgarian coup d'état of 1886''', also known as the '''9 August coup d'état''' ({{lang-bg|Деветоавгустовски преврат}}, ''Devetoavgustovski prevrat'') was an attempted dethronement of Knyaz [[Alexander of Battenberg|Alexander Battenberg]] in [[Principality of Bulgaria]], carried out on 9 August 1886. Although unsuccessful, the event led to the [[abdication]] of Alexander Battenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bulgaria/History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Frank Marby|author2=Amos Shartle Hershey|title=Handbook for the Diplomatic History of Europe, Asia, and Africa 1870-1914|publisher=National Board for Historical Service, Government Printing Office|location=Washington, DC|date=1918|chapter=The Bulgarian Revolution of 1885 |chapterurl= https://archive.org/stream/handbookfordiplo00ande#page/118/mode/2up |pages= 119–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]] Bulgaria was [[Liberation of Bulgaria|liberated from Ottoman rule]] and Knyaz Alexander Battenberg was elected in 1879 as Prince of Bulgaria at the request of the Russian Tsar, his uncle, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. The latter was assassinated in 1881 and was succeeded by the conservative [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]].

The relations between Bulgaria and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] suffered after the [[Bulgarian unification]] with [[Eastern Rumelia]] in 1885, which had not been approved by Russia. Prior to the subsequent [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]], Russia had withdrawn its military officers, who had commanded all larger units of Bulgaria's young army until that point.

Despite the successful Unification of Bulgaria, the Rusophile circles in the country held Knyaz Alexander Battenberg responsible for the deterioration of relations with Russia. The Rusophiles had valued Russia's role in supporting the restoration of Bulgaria as a state in the boundaries, promised by the preliminary [[Treaty of San Stefano]].

==Coup==
On the eve of 8 to 9 August 1886 Alexander Battenberg was arrested in his palace in [[Sofia]], forced to sign a decree for his abdication, and expelled from Bulgaria to Russia by boat. A provisional government was installed, led by [[Kliment of Tarnovo]]. However, the coup was not backed by many Bulgarian officers and politicians, including the chief of the National Assembly, [[Stefan Stambolov]]. A conter-coup, led by [[Sava Mutkurov]], was organized in [[Plovdiv]] and the members of the original coup were quickly isolated. On 17 August 1886, Alexander Battenberg returned to Bulgaria, but his reign lasted only till 26 August 1886, when he abdicated of his own recognizance in an attempt to calm down the crisis in relations with Russia.

==Aftermath==
The relations between Bulgaria and Russia continued to be hostile in the years following the coup. Bulgaria elected a new Knyaz on 7 July 1887, [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I]] of the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], an Austrian Emperor's nephew and an officer in the Austrian army. Bulgaria's domestic political life was dominated during the early years of Ferdinand's reign by liberal party leader Stefan Stambolov, whose foreign policy saw a marked cooling in relations with Russia, formerly seen as Bulgaria's protector.

The '''1921 Massawa earthquake''' took place off the coast of [[Massawa]], [[Eritrea]] on August 14 with a moment magnitude of 6.1 and a Mercalli intensity of VIII (''Severe''). The first aftershock after the initial earthquake was of similar magnitude. Significant damage was caused to the harbour at Massawa with a number of deaths reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambraseys|first=N.|authorlink=Nicholas Ambraseys|last2=Melville|first2=C.P.|last3=Adams|first3=R.D.|title=The Seismicity of Egypt, Arabia and the Red Sea: A Historical Review|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1994|isbn=0-521-39120-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aftershocks were felt as far away as [[Asmara]] and [[Dekemhare]].

The '''1976 Monaco Grand Prix''' (formally the '''XXXIV Grand Prix de Monaco''') was a [[Formula One]] [[auto racing|motor race]] held at the [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco street circuit]] in [[Monaco]] on 30 May 1976. It was the fifth round of the [[1976 Formula One season]] and the 34th Monaco Grand Prix. The race was contested over 78 laps of the 3.3&amp;nbsp;km circuit for a race distance of 257 kilometres.

The race was won by [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Niki Lauda]], who had also taken pole position in his [[Ferrari 312T2]]. Lauda won by 11 second over [[Jody Scheckter]] driving a six-wheeled [[Tyrrell P34]], whilst Scheckter's teammate, [[Patrick Depailler]], completed the podium in third position. As a consequence of the race, Lauda extended his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to 36 points over his team mate [[Clay Regazzoni]] who had retired after starting second, going off track on oil laid down when [[James Hunt]] retired, climbing back to third before crashing.

A lap down in fourth was the [[March 761]] of [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]] with the [[McLaren M23]] of [[Jochen Mass]] and the [[Fittipaldi FD04]] of [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] completing the point scoring positions.

The '''A3 motorway''' (''Greek: δρόμος Διεθνούς Αερολιμένα Λάρνακας - Αγίας Νάπας'') is a modern [[motorway]] linking [[Larnaca International Airport]], the largest airport in [[Cyprus]], and [[Ayia Napa]], a popular seaside destination.  It is 55&amp;nbsp;km long. The road was built in five phases and took about 10 years to be completed.  The first part of the road until [[Dhekelia Cantonment|Dhekelia]] is locally referred as "Larnaca [[Beltway]]" (''Greek: Παρακαμπτήριος Λάρνακας'') and the second part till the end of the motorway as "Dhekelia - Famagusta Motorway" (''Greek: Αυτοκινητόδρομος Δεκέλειας - Αμμοχώστου''). Its routing takes it past [[Aradippou]], [[Oroklini]], [[Xylotymvou]], [[Ormidia]], and [[Xylofagou]]. The Larnaca beltway section, until the final phase was completed, used to culminate in an acute bend which was a major accident blackspot.

The motorway was built in 3 stages:
1. Rizoelia Junction to [[Dhekelia Cantonment|Dhekelia]] - opened 1993
2. Rizoelia junction to [[Dromolaxia]] - Opened 1999
3. [[Dhekelia Cantonment|Dhekelia]] to [[Ayia Napa]] - opened 2003

The western terminus was altered in 2009 to facilitate access directly to the new terminal at [[Larnaca International Airport]]

The '''Austrian Silver Vienna Philharmonic''' is a silver [[bullion coin]] produced annually by the [[Austrian Mint]]. Beginning in 2008, it is now the highest minted and most well-known silver bullion coin from Europe. It is sold as a mass-produced [[Silver as an investment|investment]] coin and has sold over 54 million units during a 5-year span from 2008 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coins.coinupdate.com/austrian-silver-philharmonic/ Coin Information: Austrian Silver Philharmonic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302182508/http://coins.coinupdate.com/austrian-silver-philharmonic/ |date=March 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The coin is legal tender in Austria with a face value of 1.50 Euros. It weighs exactly 1 troy ounce of .999 fine silver. The coins are distributed from the Austrian Mint in mint cases of 500 coins each, containing 25 plastic tubes which house 20 coins each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bullion.nwtmint.com/silver_philharmonics.php Austrian Vienna Philharmonics Silver Coins]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The coin was first issued on 1 February 2008 with 7,773,000 units minted which is the lowest amount minted for any year in the series. Mintage of the coins peaked in 2011 when 17,873,700 coins were struck, making it the most common date. Mintage totals for the 2014 issues have yet to be released by the Austrian Mint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buysilvercoins.com/types/austrian-silver-philharmonic/ Austrian Silver Philharmonic]&lt;/ref&gt; With no [[key date]]s issued as of yet, the value of each Silver Vienna Philharmonic remains near the current spot price of silver without inflation of numismatic value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monex.com/prods/silver_euro.html Silver Vienna Philharmonics]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:Austrian Silver Vienna Philharmonic (Front).jpg|thumb|Austrian Silver Vienna Philharmonic (Front)]]
[[File:Austrian Silver Vienna Philharmonic Coin (back).jpg|thumb|Austrian Silver Vienna Philharmonic Coin (Back)]]
The design for the coin was originally created by Thomas Pesendorfer to be used for a gold commemorative [[Vienna Philharmonic (coin)|coin that was first issued in 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://world.mintnewsblog.com/2012/04/austrian-philharmonic-silver-bullion-coins/ Austrian Philharmonic Silver Bullion Coins]&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian Mint introduced the silver version of the coin in 2008. The design was unchanged and has remained the same each year as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldmintcoins.com/world-gold-silver-bullion-coins/austrian-vienna-philharmonic-silver-bullion-coin Austrian Vienna Philharmonic Silver Bullion Coin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Obverse: The obverse design features a [[pipe organ]] from within the [[Musikverein]], a concert hall in the [[Innere Stadt]] borough of Vienna. This is where the actual [[Vienna Philharmonic]] Orchestra plays its music. The German words "{{Lang|de|REPUBLIK ÖSTERREICH}}" (Republic of Austria) and "{{Lang|de|1 UNZE FEINSILBER}}" (1 ounce pure silver) are also minted on the obverse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.providentmetals.com/knowledge-center/austrian-silver-bullion-coins.html Austrian Silver Bullion Coins – Quick Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverse: The reverse design features an array of musical instruments such as the harp, violin, cello, flute, bassoon, and French horn. The words "{{lang|de|WIENER PHILHARMONIKER}}" (Vienna Philharmonic) and "{{lang|de|SILBER}}" (Silver) are also inscribed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coin-rare.com/austrian-philharmonic-silver-coins.aspx Austrian Philharmonic Silver Coins]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Autant d'amoureux que d'étoiles"''' ([[English Language|English]] translation: "As Many Lovers As Stars") was the [[France|French]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984]], performed in [[French Language|French]] by [[Annick Thoumazeau]].

The song was performed third on the night (following [[Luxembourg]]'s [[Sophie Carle]] with "[[100% d'amour]]" and preceding [[Spain]]'s [[Bravo (band)|Bravo]] with "[[Lady, Lady]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 61 points, placing 8th in a field of 19.

The song is a dramatic ballad, with Thoumazeau promising her unending devotion to her lover and remarking that they are not the only lovers in the world - there in fact being ''"as many lovers as stars in the sky"''.

It was succeeded as [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|French representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985 Contest]] by [[Roger Bens]] with "[[Femme dans ses rêves aussi]]".

==Migration and Settlement==
Although little history has been known about the Basimba (Big Lion) people, more needs to be said because of their very close historical connection with the BaShimba &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Mutomboko Ceremony and the Lunda-Kazembe Dynasty| publisher= Kenneth Kaunda Foundation |year=1989| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7XIyAAAAIAAJ|pp=89,95,103}}&lt;/ref&gt; who all belong to the Leopard (Ngo) Clan. Most Basimba people claim their origin lies in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], among the [[Luba people]] of  the  [[Kingdom of Luba]]. Little is actually known about these immigrants, but traces of their history are found in the legend of the Tabwa&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Zambia Museums Journal - Volume 8| publisher= National Museums of Zambia |year=2003| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lIoMAQAAMAAJ|pp=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ancestor.

Kyomba the ancestor of the Tabwa, a legendary man existed and lived on the Eastern shores of [[Lake Tanganyika]]. Faced with [[Hamitic]] pressures in the North and the people from the South to South, Kyomba and his companions crossed Lake Tanganyika by migrating to the Western shores of the Lake. Then Kyomba and his companions emigrated after the conspiracy mounted and hatched against him to the West and reached the shores of [[Lake Kivu]]. Then they crossed the Ruzizi and arrived Maniema and on the banks of river Lualaba to the second half of the 16th Century. Fanger son of Kyomba and his companions continued their migration up the river while others went elsewhere. The name Tumanya means “those that have followed the route by water’’ and Bena Kilunga means “those who followed the path on land in their migration”. The Bena Kilunga group migrated to the eastern banks of the [[Lualaba River]] and [[Lukunga River]], together with Buanza, Mumba and the Basimba people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= A history of the Bemba: political growth and change in north-eastern Zambia before 1900| publisher= University of Wisconsin Press | year=1973| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=DR0OAQAAMAAJ|pp=152, 401, 410}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Tabwa: The Rising of a New Moon, a Century of Tabwa Art| publisher= University of Michigan Museum of Art | year=1985| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=n55PAAAAMAAJ|pp=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Tumanya group migrated to Ankori or the [[Nkole people]] &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= African Concord, Issues 72-96| publisher= Concord Press of Nigeria| year=1986| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRJBAQAAIAAJ|pp=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eastwards following the Luvua (Lualaba) while their companions Lualaba River to back the lagoons in [[Upemba Depression]]. It was around the 17th Century when the gradual arrival of people in the mountains from the plains of Lualaba Kamalondo and named these "Kundelungu" Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Meteorology and Climate of Tropical Africa| publisher= Springer| year=2008| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540426361 |pp=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Gift: Economy, Society, and Environment in Central Africa| publisher= University of Wisconsin Press| year=2006| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ythyAAAAMAAJ|pp=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Tanga and his father Kyomba further migrated across the Luapula at the current location of the position of Kasenga and settled in southern Tanganyika where they were joined by members of Zimba Clan.

, avoiding quarrels will Movwe who migrated to the [[Marungu highlands]].

The Basimba or BaShimba immigrants seem to have come in [[ethnic group]]s under the leadership of Mambwe, Mauwe,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=  Customary Law of the Haya Tribe, Tanganyika Territory

When these people reached Luapula Valley the current [[Luapula Province]]  in Zambia, Mwanza Region, Northern Tanzania and at Butambala in Uganda, they decided to settle and the leader became the family or the Clan head. As the Basimba or BaShimba settlement grew the original leader, after several [[generation]], became to his descendants as [[mythical]].

Basimba or BaShimba people are recognized to be [[indigenous peoples]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Ethnographic survey of Africa; East Central Africa, Parts 9-13|publisher= Oxford university press |year=1953| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=gtaAAAAAMAAJ|pp=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 2, Issue 13| publisher= International African Institute |year=1962| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IYZRAQAAIAAJ|pp=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they were the first comers among the immigrants in Zambia or [[Northern Rhodesia]]  by then and in Tanzania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Tanzania Notes and Records |year=1956 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xxIOAQAAMAAJ |pp= 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to local tradition the original inhabitants were a Clan called the Basimba who lived in the area of Busere on [[Ukara Island]], in the South-East corner of [[Lake Victoria]], but it is not known what language they spoke and there are none of their descendants surviving. [[Tradition]] makes no mention of fighting between the Basimba immigrants and the people whom they found in Uhaya in Tanzania and at Butambala in Uganda. The Bashimba of the (Leopard clan) successfully resisted Nkuba &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa: East Central Africa, Parts 1-4| publisher= International African Institute |year=1950| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=djgKAQAAMAAJ|pp=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Northern Rhodesia (Zambia).

==Original homeland==
The original homeland of the Basimba &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= man past and present|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=1989| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_i89AAAAIAAJ|pp=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; or BaShimba &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Allegorical Speculation in an Oral Society: The Tabwa Narrative ..., Volume 122| publisher= University of California Press |year=1989| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520097394|pp=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; people or their ancestry is shrouded in myths and legends. Whereas they seem to have lost contact with their original ancestors in Congo among the [[Luba people]],leading to a cluster of Basimba (Big Lion) people migrate Northwards from Mweru – Luapula to [[Mwanza Region]] eventually erecting [[Human settlement]]'s among the [[Haya people]] in Tanzania, then at [[Butambala District]] in the central region of Uganda, [[Buddu]] &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The historical tradition of Busoga, Mukama and Kintu| publisher= Clarendon Press|year=1972| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=hdZyAAAAMAAJ|pp=86,87,88,93,95}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Masaka District]], Ntakaiwolu in [[Busoga]], Mpogo in [[Sironko District]], [[Butaleja District]] and at Lupada, Naboa,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= A History of African Motherhood: The Case of Uganda, 700-1900| publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013| url=  https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1107030803|pp=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Budaka District]], among the [[Gwere people]], in the Eastern parts of Uganda. Other Bashimba people settled in Northern Rhodesia (Zambia)  which was part of [[Zimbabwe]].

==Culture==
The Basimba practice the [[culture]] of performing [[ritual]]s and [[Ceremony|ceremonies]] of the Chishimba spirit similar to the,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Questioning Misfortune: The Pragmatics of Uncertainty in Eastern Uganda| publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0521595584|pp=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=  The Book of Life, Knowledge and Confidence| publisher=Pacific Press |year=2012 | url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1471734633 |pp=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loa]] or kongo loa culture practiced by the Basimba people of Haiti who were sold in [[slavery in Haiti]] from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].

The Basimba (Big Lion) people in Uganda maintain the Basimba Spiritual stone, this stone represents the Chishimba spirit and is related to the institution of kingship. Its absence constitutes the absence of political power. According to [[Traditional African religions]], the Chishimba spirit is synonymous to kingship and similar to the Kintu cult practiced by the leopard (Ngo) Clan people in [[Buganda]]. The Chishimba is kept in a specially prepared basket called ichipe ca calo—the basket of the nation or land. It is wrapped with bark cloth and kept in a specifically prepared shrine (ing'anda yaba Ba Chishimba or esawo lye ejjembe lya Basimba) dedicated to the spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A Colonial Lexicon: Of Birth Ritual, Medicalization, and Mobility in the Congo

Basimba people worked with [[Bunyoro]]-Kitara Kingdom's Priest in charge of the sacred pool of Muntebere. Each year the Bunyoro King sent a young slave-woman, two cows and a white sheep to the Priest. The slave-woman was given as a wife to one of the Abasimba Clan who was a servant of the Priest.

==The Abasimba Dance==

The abasimba dance of the Basimba people is a hunting dance performed by the Wajita or [[Jita people]] of [[Ukerewe Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theater: Africa| publisher=Routledge |year=2013| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1136359494|pp=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mashindano!: Competitive Music Performance in East Africa| publisher= Mkuki na Nyota Publishers, |year=2000| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uh2fAAAAMAAJ|pp=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre| publisher= A &amp; C Black |year=2006| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1847140017|pp=746}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Publication, Issue 20| publisher= The Institute |year=1981| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JLhJAAAAYAAJ|pp=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Mutomboko Ceremony and the Lunda-Kazembe Dynasty| publisher= Kenneth Kaunda Foundation |year=1989| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7XIyAAAAIAAJ|pp=96,97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Basimba people Clan names]] of Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia are named after their lineal ancestors.

==Beliefs==
Nowadays, between 40% to 50% of the Basimba people are [[Christians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Annual Report of the American Bible Society | publisher=  American Bible Society | year=1971| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=LiZXAAAAYAAJ|pp=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Zaire Church News-Volumes 1-60 | publisher=  Congo Protestant Council | year=1912| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=BrATAAAAIAAJ|pp=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Baptist Quarterly: Incorporating the Transactions of the Baptist Historical Society, Issues 1-8| publisher=Baptists| year=1972| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=dmYmAQAAIAAJ|pp=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Church, Clan and the World| publisher= Gleerup | year=1974| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=SsEOAQAAIAAJ|pp=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 50% are [[Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Women Writing Africa: The eastern region| publisher= Feminist Press at the City University of New York| year=2007| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1558615342|pp=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides that, traditional beliefs are very widespread among them. The most important features are ancestor-worship (the term is called inappropriate by some authors) and [[totemism]].

The Basimba of [[Kisangani]] who martyred Dr. Paul Carison of the Christ Church during the [[Congo Crisis]]  of 1964 to 1965 participated in the [[Simba Rebellion]] that was later defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Annual Report of the American Bible Society, Volume 156| publisher= American Bible Society |year=1971| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=LiZXAAAAYAAJ|pp=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestors==
According to Basimba tradition, an [[afterlife]] does take place in another world, it is another form of existence in another world. The Basimba attitude towards dead ancestors is very similar to that towards living parents and grandparents.
There is a famous ritual to contact the dead ancestors that is practiced by the Basimba people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Questioning Misfortune: The Pragmatics of Uncertainty in Eastern Uganda| publisher= Cambridge University Press| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0521595584|pp=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[Haitian Vodou art]] related to [[Loa]] a [[Haitian vodou]] &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Full Guide to Becoming a Real Wizard, Witch Or Necromancer| publisher= Lulu. com| year=2009| url=  https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1449967639|pp=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Doo Doo That Voodo| publisher= Pedia Press| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=sfA26kAvkcYC|pp=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mythologies| publisher= Pedia Press| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=Y21XOYRQUgQC|pp=496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Creole Religions of the Caribbean: An Introduction from Vodou and .| publisher= NYU Press| year=2003| url=  https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0814727204|pp=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Hegel, Haiti,: And Universal History | publisher= University of Pittsburgh Press | year=2009| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=i7EkAQAAMAAJ|pp=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Roots of Haiti's Vodou-Christian Faith: African and Catholic ...| publisher= ABC-CLIO | year=2014| url=  https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1440832048|pp=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Spirits and the Law: Vodou and Power in Haiti | publisher= University of Chicago Press | year=2011| url=  https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0226703800|pp=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; religion practiced by the Basimba people of [[Haiti]] an Island that was proclaimed by [[Napoleon]]  as an independent republic in 1804 and often lasts all night.

==Totems==
Basimba totems (muziro) have been in use among the Basimba people since the initial development of their culture. Totems identify the different clans among the Basimba people that historically made up the dynasties of their ancient civilization. There are seven different totems that have been identified among the Basimba (Big Lion)people in [[Zimbabwe]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Zambia]] and [[Uganda]] , such as the Basimba among the Haya Tribe in [[Tanzania]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Origins of Kingship, Traditions and Symbolism in the Great Lakes Region of Africa |publisher= Coronet Books Incorporated |year=2008 | url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9155472958|pp= 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
People of the same Clan use a common set of totems usually animals or birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Africa and the Wider World: East, central, and southern Africa since 1800| publisher=Longman Nigeria| year=1965| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=_JgPAQAAMAAJ|pp=45,118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= South African Journal of Science: Being the Organ of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science, Volumes 17-18| publisher=South African Association for the Advancement of Science| year=1920| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=2a8rAQAAMAAJ|pp=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Encyclopædia Britannica - Volume 22 | publisher= Encyclopædia britannica Company, Limited| year=1929| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=G5ezUHsW4ZAC|pp=300,316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Encyclopædia Britannica: A New Survey of Universal Knowledge, Volume 22| publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica| year=1956| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=m287AAAAIAAJ|pp=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of animal totems include Ngo/mbwili ([[Leopard]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Totemism and Exogamy, Vol. II (in Four Volumes)| publisher= Cosmo, Inc.|year=2013| url=  https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1605209791|pp=624}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leopard Cat]], Genet [[Cat]] which in the [[Lega language]] is known as Musimba&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Lega Culture; Art, Initiation, and Moral Philosophy Among a Central African ...| publisher= University of California Press| year=1973| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520020855|pp=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Africa-Tervuren, Volume 25 | publisher= Amis du Musée royal de l'Afrique centrale | year=1979| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jesPAQAAMAAJ|pp=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also known as Kasimba in luganda language and known as Zimba in the Luba language and Nshimba in the Bemba language, [[Lion]]  (Mpologoma), Mbwa ([[Dog]]), Kikere ([[Frog]]) and Nkoko ([[Rooster]]). People of the same totem are the descendants of one common [[ancestor]] (the founder of that totem) and thus are not allowed to marry or have an intimate relationship. The totems cross regional groupings and therefore provide a wall for development of [[ethnic group]] among the Basimba.

Basimba chiefs are required to be able to recite the history of their totem group right from the initial founder before they can be sworn in as chiefs.

==Orphans==
The totem system is a severe problem for many [[orphan]], especially for Basimba or BaShimba women&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= A Colonial Lexicon: Of Birth Ritual, Medicalization, and Mobility in the Congo| publisher=  Duke University Press | year=1999| url=  https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0822323664|pp=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; married to other Clans. The Basimba people are afraid of being punished by ghosts, if they violate rules connected with the unknown totem of a foundling. Therefore, it is very difficult to find adoptive parents for such children. And if the foundlings have grown up, they have problems getting married and on their death they are not buried on the Basimba ancestral grounds.

==Burials==
The identification by totem has very important ramifications at traditional ceremonies such as the Basimba burial ceremony. A person with a different totem cannot initiate burial of the deceased. A person of the same totem, even when coming from a different tribe, can initiate burial of the deceased. For example, a Muganda of the Ngo (Leopard) totem can initiate burial of a Musimba of the Leopard totem and that is perfectly acceptable in Basimba tradition. But a Musimba of a different totem cannot perform the ritual functions required to initiate burial of the deceased.

If a person initiates the burial of a person of a different totem, he runs the risk of being asked to pay a fine to the family of the deceased. Such fines traditionally were paid with cattle or goats but nowadays substantial amounts of money can be asked for. If they bury their dead family members, they would come back at some point to cleanse the stone of the burial.

==Basimba Clan groups==
The Basimba people consider themselves subjects of the Chishimba, the Basimba's single paramount Chief. These Basimba people lived in villages of 50 to 100 people and are now numbering to 100,000 in number by 2016. 
There are seven Basimba (Big Lion) people Clan groups named after animals&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Oxford Encyclopedia of African Thought: Abol-impe, Volume 1=| publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010| url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0195334736|pp=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Native Races of Africa and Madagascar| publisher=the University of Michigan |year=1938| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sdg5AAAAIAAJ|pp=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics-Volume 2| publisher= Scribner |year=1957| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=63MrAQAAMAAJ|pp=352, 353}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these are:-
# The [[Leopard]], (Ngo) [[Clan]].
# The [[Leopard Cat]] Clan.
# The Genet [[Cat]] (Kasimba) Clan.
# The [[Lion]],(Mpologoma) Clan.
# The [[Frog]] Clan.
# The [[Dog]] Clan.
# The [[Rooster]] Clan. 
Some of the Basimba people migrated northwards from Luapula valley after the disintegration of the Shila states and others remained in Northern Rhodesia currently known as BaShimba or abeena Ngo (Leopard) totem Clan. The BaShimba Leopard totem Clan is a ruling clan among the [[Lungu]] and [[Bemba people|Bemba]].

==Countries Basimba People Exist==
Basimba or BaShimba&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Works Issued by the Hakluyt Society| publisher= The Society|year=1901| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=wok7AAAAIAAJ|pp=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; people exist in [[Zambia]] formerly known as Northern Rhodesia, [[Zimbabwe]], [[Uganda]], [[Haiti]],[[DR Congo]]  and [[Tanzania]]. For example, the omugurusi of the Basimba clan is Mauwe who on the day of his birth a dog had puppies. This dog often washed Mauwe as a child by licking him. Mauwe later out of gratitude, ordered his descendants to consider the dog as their friend, the word "Basimba" or "BaShimba" actually has several meanings. It may designate people of Basimba people origin regardless of where they live e.g. whether they live in urban areas or in the original rural Basimba areas of Mpogo, [[Sironko]] , Lupada, Naboa in [[Budaka District]] or [[Butambala District]], Mooni,[[Mbale District]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=  Keeping The Faith|publisher= Lulu.com| year=2017| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1365828646|pp=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Uganda]], Luapula Valley in Zambia or Northern Rhodesia and  [[Kagera Region]] among the [[Haya people|Haya]] tribe in Bugorora Ward or County of  [[Missenyi District]] in  [[Tanzania]]. The original language of the Basimba people is unknown.

The BaShimba people living in Zambia's [[Northern Province, Zambia|Northern province]], among the [[Lungu people|Lungu]] and [[Bemba people|Bemba]] tribes speak the language which is most closely related to the [[Bantu languages]] the [[Lungu language|Lungu]] and [[Bemba language|ChiBemba]] (in Zambia and the DRC), [[Haya language|Haya]] (in Tanzania) and [[Luganda]] of the Baganda and [[Lugwere]] of the [[Gwere people]] (in Uganda). In Uganda, Luganda is mainly spoken in the central and eastern parts of Uganda, and has become the most widely spoken language in the Country, although not always as a first language.

==Genealogy==
The [[History]] or [[Genealogy]] of the Basimba (Big Lion) people has given rise to numerous debates among [[historians]] to whether the Basimba people of the Leopard (Ngo)  Clan in Uganda come with [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]], [[Kato Kintu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= People's Names: A Cross-cultural Reference Guide to the Proper Use ...| publisher= McFarland &amp; Company |year=1997| url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=kAUWAQAAIAAJ|pp=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Dictionary of African Historical Biography| publisher=University of California Press |year=1989| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520066111|pp=72, 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 14th Century or migrated either direct from Congo or Luapula valley to Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Tanganyika Notes and Records: Issues 13-20| publisher= Tanganyika Society |year=1942| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kaoaAQAAMAAJ|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=  Tanganyika Notes and Records: Issues 13-18| publisher= Tanganyika Society |year=1942| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xa8KAQAAIAAJ|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= From Blessing to Violence: History and Ideology in the Circumcision Ritual ...| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1986| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0521314046|pp=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians, anthropologists and sociologists like [[David William Cohen]], Ian George Cunnison,Hans Cory, Mwelwa Chambika Musambachine, [[Gideon Were]],Stephen Kyeyune, Tausir Niane, Mary Douglas, M. Hartnoll, Dr. Schinz and Fisher A. B among others have written books about Basimba people but have not stated the names of the Basimba [[ancestors]] who left the [[Luba people]] in Congo and migrated to places like Zambia, Zimbabwe, [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]]. Some historians who have written [[History of Africa]]  books, use imprecise narrative documents to make estimates which must be treated with caution.
Societies like [[Anthropological Society of London]] and [[Ethnological Society of London]] have also not yet published a full physical or cultural aspects of the Basimba people or due to the pronunciation of the name Basimba as [[Vazimba]] who migrated from East Africa and settled in Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Ancestors, Power and History in Madagascar| publisher= BRILL|year=1999| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9004112898|pp=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vazimba are kinsmen of the Ba-Simba.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Earth and Its Inhabitants …: South and East Africa| publisher= University of California |year=1895| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JGdGAQAAMAAJ|pp=447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Man, Past and Present| publisher= University Press |year=1900| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DDwLAQAAIAAJ|pp=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Movement, Borders and Identities in Africa| publisher= University of Rochester Press |year=2009| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1580462960|pp=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Medieval Africa, 1250-1800| publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2001| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0521793726|pp=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Between Five Lines: The Development of Ethnicity in Tanzania with ...| publisher= Nordic Africa Institute| year=1997| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9171064087|pp=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= African Abstracts: Bulletin Analytique Africaniste-Issues 6-7| publisher= International African Institute| year=1955| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kWzVAAAAMAAJ|pp=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Early Kingdoms in Madagascar, 1600-1700| publisher= Holt, Rinehart and Winston| year=1970| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kjByAAAAMAAJ|pp=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Letters from Kenya and Tanzania to Institute of Current World Affairs| year=1954| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1PxDAQAAIAAJ|pp=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Tanganyika Notes and Records – Issues 56-61| publisher= Tanganyika Society| year=1961| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aq8aAQAAMAAJ|pp=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Nada: the Southern Rhodesia Native Affairs Department Annual, Issue 28| publisher= Southern Rhodesia Dept of Native Affiairs|year=1951| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AlEUAAAAIAAJ|pp=58,59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Memory: Luba art and the making of History| publisher= Museum for African Art |year=1996| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=379131677X|pp=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Zaire, the political economy of underdevelopment| publisher= Praeger |year=1979| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXu1AAAAIAAJ|pp=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Rebellion and Social Protest in Africa: Ninth Annual Spring...| publisher= African Studies Program |year=1982| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hqmfAAAAMAAJ|pp=21,22,23,33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa| publisher= University of California Press |year=1989| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0852550421|pp=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Tanganyika Notes and Records-Issues 56-61| publisher= Tanzania Society |year=1961| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aq8aAQAAMAAJ|pp=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Tanzania Notes and Records – Issues 77-80| publisher= Tanzania Society |year=1976| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ya4aAQAAMAAJ|pp=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Ancestors, Power and History in Madagascar| publisher=BRILL |year=1999| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9004112898|pp=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Lost People: Magic and the Legacy of Slavery in Madagascar| publisher=Indiana University Press| year=2007| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0253219159|pp=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Ancestral Encounters in Highland Madagascar: Material Signs and Traces of ...| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=2014| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1107036097|pp=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Antananarivo Annual and Madagascar Magazine: A Record of Information on ...

== History ==
Introduced to Africa around the 1960s basketball has become a very popular sport. After more people took notice and practiced, professional teams were formed. The managers of the first African National Federation decide to participate and compete in FIBA, which is the world basketball governing body. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiba.com/africa/history|title=History|website=FIBA.com|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Held on the 30th and 31st of August 1960 the FIBA Congress allowed the Egyptian Basketball Federation to set up an institution in order to compete.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This led to the integration of twelve African countries to join FIBA and the world stage. These countries include Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Egypt, Ghana, Guinea Conakry, Mali, Morocco, Libya, North Rhodesia, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Togo. Currently, FIBA Africa grew to a point where every single country in Africa has a designated team, leading to 54 active teams in the institution.

The activities of the youth program [[Basketball Without Borders]] in Africa, and program director [[Masai Ujiri]], are profiled in [[Hubert Davis (filmmaker)|Hubert Davis]]'s 2016 documentary film ''[[Giants of Africa]]''.&lt;ref name=arthur&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/sports/raptors/2016/09/02/masai-ujiri-building-on-hope-with-giants-of-africa-arthur.html "Masai Ujiri building on hope with Giants of Africa: Arthur"].

'''Burundi Workers' Party''' or '''UBU''' ({{lang-fr|Parti des travailleurs du Burundi}}; {{lang-rn|Umugambwe wa'Bakozi Uburundi}}) was a clandestine [[communist party]] in [[Burundi]]. Its primary constituency was the large Burundian [[refugee]] population situated in neighboring [[Rwanda]]. Founded in August 1979, one of its most prominent leaders was the ethnic [[Hutu]] intellectual [[Melchior Ndadaye]], who became the first democratically elected [[president of Burundi]] in 1993.

When UBU was disbanded, followers of Ndadaye regrouped into the [[Front for Democracy in Burundi]] (FRODÉBU).

[[File:Cambodia International Airlines Boeing 737-200 Volpati.jpg|thumb|A Cambodia Airlines Boeing 737-200.(1st incarnation)]]

'''Cambodia Airlines''' was an [[airline]] in [[Cambodia]] owned by [[The Royal Group]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phnompenhpost.com/2013052965903/Business/cambodia-airlines-to-get-20m.html "Cambodia Airlines to get $20m"], ''Phnom Penh Post''{{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Philippine Airlines|PAL Holdings, Inc.]] of the [[Philippines]].

==History==
Cambodia Airlines was founded in 1997 but its operations ceased in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airlineupdate.com/content_public/airlines/se_asia/cambodia.htm World Airline Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Philippines|Philippine's]] flag carrier [[Philippine Airlines]] formed a joint venture&lt;ref&gt;Doris C. Dumlao and Paolo G. Montecillo (4 April 2013), [http://business.inquirer.net/115333/pal-kith-meng-of-cambodia-sign-deal-to-set-up-cambodia-airlines "PAL, Kith Meng of Cambodia sign deal to set up Cambodia Airlines"], Inquirer Business&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Agcaoili (4 April 2013), [http://www.philstar.com/business/2013/04/04/926595/pal-royal-group-cambodia-form-international-airline-venture "PAL, Royal Group of Cambodia form international airline venture"], ''The Philippine Star''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim Arveen Patria (4 April 2013), [https://ph.news.yahoo.com/pal--cambodian-group-to-launch-new-international-airline-094834761.html "PAL, Cambodian group to launch new international airline"], Yahoo! News Philippines&lt;/ref&gt; with The Royal Group of [[Cambodia]] by buying a 49% stake in Cambodia Airlines. San Miguel Corporation, a diversified conglomerate in the [[Philippines]] bought a stake in PAL Holdings, Inc. and took control of the management of [[Philippine Airlines]] from the [[Lucio Tan]] group. The Royal Group of [[Cambodia]] owned 100% Cambodia Airlines prior to the joint venture. Inter-country operations between [[Manila]] and [[Phnom Penh]] are expected to begin in June while international flights is set to start in October the same year. Both countries are currently served by [[Cebu Pacific]] with its [[Manila]]-[[Siem Reap]] route.

In 2014, the airline went out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ch-aviation.com/portal/airline/KMH|title=Cambodia Airlines|publisher=ch-aviation|date=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fleet==
The Cambodia Airlines would initially lease two [[Airbus A320]] for international flights and two [[Bombardier Dash 8]] for domestic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2510">'''Coffee production in Angola''' refers to the production of [[coffee]] in [[Angola]]. Coffee is one of Angola's largest agricultural products.

Angola was the third largest producer of coffee until 1973 while controlled by [[Portuguese Angola|Portugal]].&lt;ref name="ANGOP2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/economia/Coffee-Production-Angola-Rises-5000-Tons,a8d1cf1c-ce27-41cf-9e7a-c4d46c9229f2.html|title=Coffee Production In Angola Rises To 5000 Tons|date=16 January 2007|publisher=[[ANGOP|Angola News Press]]|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Angolan coffee was at its pick of excellency of quality during the presidency of Eurico de Azevedo Noronha of the Instituto do Café de Angola, until his death in 1973. 

==History==
Plantation and production of coffee contributed largely to the economy of Angola's northwestern area, including the [[Uíge Province]].&lt;ref name="ebizguides2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=ebizguides|title=Angola: All You Need to Know to Do Business and Have Fun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4vvzrSluC8C&amp;pg=PA331|accessdate=4 May 2012|date=January 2008|publisher=MTH Multimedia S.L.|isbn=9788493397883|pages=331–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee production was started by the Portuguese in the 1830s and soon became a cash crop; the popular crop grown on approximately 2000 Angolan plantations, owned mostly by the Portuguese, was [[robusta coffee]]. In the 1970s, Angola was one of the largest coffee-producing countries in Africa. However, the civil war for independence from the Portuguese rule devastated the coffee plantations and many coffee agronomists migrated to [[Brazil]], with the coffee plants grown on plantations becoming wild bushes. Rehabilitation of the plantations has been ongoing since 2000, but the investment required to replace the 40-year-old unproductive plants are estimated to be US$230 million. With the opening up of new roads, industrial activity in the province is taking shape.&lt;ref name="Benarde2006"&gt;{{cite book|first=Melvin A.|last= Benarde|title=Our precarious habitat?: the sky is not falling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9O82L8QEZXcC&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=4 May 2012|year=2006|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=9780471740650|pages=104–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Contras'city''''' is a [[Senegal]]ese 1968 short documentary film.

== Synopsis ==
A fictional documentary that portrays the city of [[Dakar]], Senegal, as we hear the conversation between a Senegalese man (the director, Djibril Diop Mambéty) and a French woman, Inge Hirschnitz. As we travel through the city in a picturesque horse-drawn wagon, we chaotically rush into this and that popular neighborhood of the capital, discovering contrast after contrast: A small African community waiting at the Church's door, Muslims praying on the sidewalk, the [[Rococo architecture]] of the Government buildings, the modest stores of the craftsmen near the main market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7537">In [[Canada]], the '''Office of the Custodian of Enemy Property''', attached to the [[Secretary of State for Canada]],{{sfn|Roberts-Moore|1986|p=95}} was established in 1916 and existed until 1985, dealing with the property of [[Military history of Canada|Canada's enemies in both World Wars]] as well as with the seized property of [[Japanese Canadians]].

==History==
===1916-1939===
The office of Custodian was originally created in 1916, during the [[First World War]], deriving its authority from the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' and the ''Consolidated Orders Respecting Trading with the Enemy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 6, 1916|title= Supplement: P.C. 1023|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=6215&amp;f=p|journal= [[Canada Gazette]]|pages= 1-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its functions included the seizure and liquidation of enemy property. This followed the adoption of the UK [[trading with the enemy]] restrictions enacted in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 28862|date= 4 August 1914|page= 6166|supp= 2|title=A Proclamation Relating to Trading with the Enemy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Trading with the Enemy Act, 1914|abbr =|year =1914|chapter =87 (UK)|link=https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl191415v01cana#page/n218/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been incorporated into Canadian law in 1914 by [[order in council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= October 30, 1914|title= Extra: P.C. 2724|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=14572&amp;f=p|journal= [[Canada Gazette]]|pages= 2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1916 to 1919, the [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] and the Secretary of State had joint responsibility for acting as Custodian.{{sfn|Roberts-Moore|1986|p=96}}

From 1920 to 1939, it served the function of administering war claims and reparations. Under legislation authorizing the conclusion of treaties of peace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Treaties of Peace Act, 1919|abbr =S.C.|year =1919 (2nd Sess.)|chapter =30|link=https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1919v01cana_0#page/81/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Treaty of Peace (Germany) Order, 1920'' was issued to create the Office,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/politics-government/orders-council/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=392695 P.C. 755] (April 14, 1920)&lt;/ref&gt; under the authority of the Secretary of State as sold custodian.{{sfn|Roberts-Moore|1986|p=96}} The Office acted as one of the "clearing offices" authorized under Article 296 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] for the collection and payment of enemy debts,{{sfn|Roberts-Moore|1986|p=96}} and Article 297 authorized Canada to keep and liquidate any German property in Canada.{{sfn|Roberts-Moore|1986|p=98}} Investigations and recommendations respecting claims for reparations were undertaken by the separately appointed [[Royal Commission on Reparations]], chaired by [[Errol McDougall]].{{sfn|Roberts-Moore|1986|p=98}}

===1939-1985===
With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the ''Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1939'' expanded the scope of the Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= September 11, 1939|title= Extra: P.C. 2512|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=8325&amp;f=p|journal= [[Canada Gazette]]|pages= 1-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1942 the role of the Custodian was expanded to include the administration of property seized from [[Japanese Canadians]].

In the postwar period, the Custodian had the responsibility for resolving Canadian War Claims, and the resolution of outstanding wartime property issues. This latter process was complicated by the implications of the large scale nationalization of property in [[Eastern Europe]] by the Communist regimes established in the post war period under Soviet auspices. The WWII regulations were continued on a temporary basis following the end of hostilities, and were continued in 1947 by the ''Trading with the Enemy (Transitional Powers) Act''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Trading with the Enemy (Transitional Powers) Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1947|chapter =24|link=https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1947v01cana#page/138/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act ceased to have effect at the end of September 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= October 21, 1992|title= SI/92-192: Proclamation Declaring that the Act shall Continue in Force until September 30, 1992|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=14904&amp;f=p|journal= [[Canada Gazette]]|volume= 126|issue= 22|pages= 4076-4077}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was consequently repealed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Department of Public Works and Government Services Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1996|chapter =16|section=66|link=https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1996v01cana#page/n519/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office ceased operations in 1985. Its files were transferred to [[Library and Archives Canada]], but there is evidence that some have been destroyed without assessing their historical value.{{sfn|Roberts-Moore|1986|p=100}} The Office never produced [[annual report]]s outlining its activities.{{sfn|Roberts-Moore|1986|p=95}}

The '''Embassy of Ireland''' in [[Paris]] ({{lang-fr|Ambassade d'Irlande à Paris}}) is the [[diplomatic mission]] of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] to [[France]]. It is located at 12 Avenue Foch in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=30661 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009143417/http://web.dfa.ie/home/index.aspx?id=30661 |archivedate=2014-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embassy is also represented in France by [[Consul (representative)|Honorary Consuls]] in [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], [[Antibes]]/[[Cannes]] and [[Lyon]]. The embassy is accredited to [[Monaco]], where it also has an honorary consul.

The current Ambassador to France is [[Patricia O'Brien]], previously the Irish Ambassador to the [[United Nations]] and Other International Organisations, Geneva. 

== Building ==
Built in 1892 by architect [[Ernest Sanson]], the embassy is located in the historic [[Hôtel de Breteuil]].

'''Erin Christine Pettit''' (born 1971) is an American [[Glaciology|glaciologist]] focusing on [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.explore-ice.gi.alaska.edu/about/|title=About|website=ice|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is an associate professor of [[geophysics]] and glaciology at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/erin-pettit/|title=Erin Pettit, Geophysicist and Glaciologist|last=|first=|website=NationalGeographic.com|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work focuses on [[ice shelf]] disintegration, [[Sea level rise|sea-level rise]] and [[ocean circulation]] changes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Pettit, born in 1971, is originally from [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]. She started her academic career pursuing an Sc.B. in mechanical engineering at [[Brown University]], which she received in 1994.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu/people/pettit|title=Erin Pettit|last=|first=|date=|website=Glaciers Group|publisher=[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before she attended graduate school, she lived in [[Los Angeles]] where she volunteered for the [[Sierra Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://polarfield.com/blog/girls-ice-mountaineering-adventure-learning-experience-young-women/|title=Girls on Ice: A Mountaineering Adventure and Learning Experience for Young Women|last=|first=|date=24 January 2013|work=Polar Field|access-date=19 May 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then went on to earn her Ph.D. in [[Geophysics]] from the [[University of Washington]] (UW) in 2003,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where her dissertation focused on the dynamic behavior of ice divides.  Pettit also worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at UW until 2006 and then became a research physical scientist at the [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory|Cold Regions Research and Engineering Lab]] in New Hampshire.  In 2008, she moved to The University of Alaska, Fairbanks ([[University of Alaska Fairbanks|UAF]]), and promoted to Associate Professor.

== Career and impact ==

'''Esimbi''' is a [[Southern Bantoid]] language of southwestern [[Cameroon]]. It's generally classified as [[Tivoid languages|Tivoid]] but with little evidence; it has just about as much in common with [[Grassfields languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/Bantoid/Tivoid/General/Tivoid%20comparative.pdf|title=The Tivoid Languages|last=Blench|first=Roger|date=2010|website=|page=13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called '''Isimbi''', '''Simpi''', '''Age''', '''Aage''', '''Bogue''' and '''Mburugam'''.

'''Genertela''' is the northern [[continent]] of [[Greg Stafford]]'s [[fiction]]al world [[Glorantha]].

==Geography and climate==
Genertela is divided into a few distinct regions by three great mountain ranges:
* The Rockwood Mountains and their western extension, the Nidan Mountains, divide western and central Genertela into a northern and a southern half.
* The Mislari and Skyreach Mountains separate the southwest from the central south and meet the Rockwoods in the Dragon Pass region of Maniria.
* The Shanshan Mountains in the east separate the lands of Kralorela and Verenela from the steppes in eastern central Genertela.

The climate ranges from [[Arctic]] (Fronela and Valind's Glacier in the northwest) to [[subtropical]] (Verenela in the southeast).

==Inhabitants==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7174">The '''Group for a Switzerland without an Army''', (GSwA; {{lang-de|Gruppe für eine Schweiz ohne Armee}}, GSoA; {{lang-fr|Groupe pour une Suisse sans armée}}, GSsA; {{lang-it|Gruppo per una Svizzera senza Esercito}}, GSsE) is a group working to reduce the military activities of [[Switzerland]]. The Group was created in [[Solothurn]] on 12 September 1982 by 120 people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110706233415/http://www.gssa.ch/spip/spip?article102 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Its roster has varied considerably; as of 2009 its website states that it consists of about 20,000 members or supporters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsoa.ch/english |title=English &amp;#124; GSoA - Gruppe für eine Schweiz ohne Armee |language=de |website=Gsoa.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting largely of [[pacifists]] and [[Anti-militarism|anti-militarists]].

==Means and objectives==
The group is politically active and spreads awareness of its cause in several ways:
*using the direct democratic tools in Switzerland to propose constitutional amendments and stimulate the public debate;
*practical and legal information, such as alternatives to Switzerland's mandatory military service, e.g. [[Swiss Civilian Service]], often opted for by [[conscientious objectors]];
*media work, covering subjects such as arms equipment sales.

Currently, the group focuses on the following  topics:
*opposition to arms trade: In 2007, the group filed enough signatures for a national [[initiative]] against arms trade. The Swiss would vote in a referendum on an amendment to the constitution that would ban the export of any weapon from Switzerland. This national referendum was held on November 29, 2009.
*opposition to arms procurements, for example against the fighter jets which the Swiss army is about to purchase;
*constant criticism of Switzerland's militaristic traditions.

==Initiatives and referendums==
In early 1986 the group launched its first [[popular initiative (Switzerland)|initiative]], named "Für eine Schweiz ohne Armee und für eine umfassende Friedenspolitik" (''For a Switzerland without an army and an overall peaceful political stance''), which gathered 111,300 signatures (100,000 were required to initiate a vote). On 26 November 1989, 68.6% of eligible voters cast their ballot, resulting in 1,052,218 (35.6%) votes for the initiative. The high percentage of yes voters stunned everybody,{{who|date=November 2010}} and was interpreted as a manifestation of a remarkable loss of significance of the military in Swiss society. Although the initiative was rejected, the surprising result of the initiative influenced later reforms of Switzerland's armed forces.

In Spring 1992, both chambers of the Swiss parliament decided to procure 34 [[F/A-18 Hornet]] fighter jets. Within 32 days, the GSoA gathered 503,719 signatures. Never before and never since has an initiative been submitted within such a short time or with a comparable number of signatures{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. Nevertheless, the Swiss people rejected the initiative on the ballot by 57% to 43%.

In 1999, the GSoA assisted in collecting the 50,000 valid signatures necessary for a referendum on whether Switzerland would join the [[United Nations]]. The Swiss electorate approved this proposal in 2002. In 2001, the GSoA gathered more than 60,000 signatures for a referendum against the revised legislation regulating the structure and deployment of the armed forces. The GSoA especially opposed the option to send armed troops abroad &amp;mdash; a concern that was shared by some right-wing traditionalists. On 10 June 2001, the revised legislation was approved by 51% of the voters.

On 2 December 2001, Swiss voters considered two additional GSoA initiatives, called "In favor of a credible security policy and a Switzerland without an army" and "Solidarity instead of soldiers: In favor of a voluntary civilian peace service". In contrast to the first initiative to abolish the Swiss army, there was only sparse public debate on the issue - another topic dominated the media and the minds of the people: The [[September 11 attacks]] which occurred a few weeks before the vote took place. Both initiatives were rejected by 78% and 77% of the voters.

On 21 September 2007, the GSoA submitted an initiative that required a ban on all arms exports from Switzerland. This initiative was rejected on November 29, 2009 with 68.2% of the voters casting a no.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/vi/vis346.html |title=Eidgenössische Volksinitiative 'für ein Verbot von Kriegsmaterial-Exporten' |website=Admin.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another initiative required stricter legislation on private possession of firearms and a stop to the [[Gun politics in Switzerland|Swiss tradition]] to store the assault rifles of each soldier at home. The initiative was supported by some 40 organisations, of which the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland]], the [[Green Party of Switzerland]] and the GSoA made the largest contributions. The initiative was rejected on February 13, 2011 with 56.3% of the voters saying no.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110207040228/http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/content/ejpd/de/home/dokumentation/abstimmungen/2011-02-13.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

GSoA's initiative to abolish [[conscription]] was rejected by 73.2% of the Swiss electorate on September 22, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/vi/vis391.html |title=Eidgenössische Volksinitiative 'Ja zur Aufhebung der Wehrpflicht' |website=Admin.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the [[Swiss Federal Council]] announced its plans to purchase a new generation of fighter aircraft. Immediately after this, the GSoA started an initiative that proposes a 10-year-moratorium for aircraft procurements. The collection of signatures was completed in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''Swiss Face Fighter Vote'', ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]'', '''170''', 25 (22 June 2009), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; After garanting the group that there would be a Referendum about new fighter jets the group pulled the initiative back. When the parliament decided to buy new jets 2014 it was possible to collect signatures for a referendum which is easier to win than an initiative. In the end 53% of Swiss voters decided not to buy new [[Gripen]] fighter jets on May 18, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geiser |first=Urs |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/wings-of-air-force-clipped-in-nationwide-ballot/38606386 |title=Wings of air force clipped in nationwide ballot - SWI |website=Swissinfo.ch |date=2014-05-18 |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first victory on the ballot for GSoA in a nationwide referendum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2636">'''Reducing administrative burdens – effective inspection and enforcement''' (the '''Hampton Report''') is a March 2005 UK publication produced under businessman [[Philip Hampton]]. The UK Statutory Code of Practice for Regulators is based on its recommendations with the purpose to promote efficient and
effective approaches to regulatory inspection and enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;[[BERR]] [http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file45019.pdf Statutory Code of Practice for Regulators], 17 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2004 Budget]], Hampton was asked to lead a review of regulatory inspection and enforcement. This review produced the ''Hampton Report''. This report, together with the later ''Macrory Review'' "Regulatory Justice – making sanctions effective"&lt;ref&gt;The Macrory Review is available @ http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file44593.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; led to the UK [[Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;The UK Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008 is available @ http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/13/pdfs/ukpga_20080013_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

One result was that the [[Ayres and Braithwaite Compliance Pyramid]] was effectively codified into UK law.

The Hampton Report also recommended an enhanced role for the [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT). The OFT were to set national priorities and coordinate performance management of local authority trading standards services.
==Local Better Regulation Office== 
The 2005 Report initiated the creation of the ''Local Better Regulation Office'' (LBRO) as a government-owned company [[statutory corporation]] with [[statutory powers]]. Previously the Consumer and Trading Standards Agency (CTSA), &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/bud_bud05_hampton.htm|title=Hampton review on regulatory inspections and enforcement|date=16 March 2005|accessdate=2009-01-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710064740/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/bud_bud05_hampton.htm|archivedate=10 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it set out standards on how trading standards and other business regulators carried out their work to minimise the impact on legitimate business. 

The LBRO was dissolved on 1 April 2012, its functions taken over by the [[Better Regulation Delivery Office]], an independent unit within the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbro.org.uk/ LBRO website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Clive Lester Grace, erstwhile Chair of the LBRO, was awarded an [[OBE]] in the  [[2013 New Year Honours]] for services to Business and voluntary service to Communities.

==Early life and education==
Ahn graduated from [[Seoul National University]] in 1982 (majoring in Biological [[Oceanography]]) and then received her PhD in Coastal Oceanography from the [[State University of New York]] at [[Stony Brook University|Stony Brook]] in 1990. Ahn started her research at the Korean Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) on July 1, 1991.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career and impact==
Ahn was in charge of [[environmental monitoring]] program at the King Sejong Station from 1996 to 2011, and conducted field surveys to obtain scientific data necessary for designation of the [[Antarctic Specially Protected Area]] (ASPA #171) near the Korean station. Ahn has also served as a representative and a National Contact Point of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) at the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings]] from 1997 through 2014, until she was designated as the overwintering officer-in-charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eng.kopri.re.kr/home/contents/images/contents/e_5310000/Final_CEE_Jang_Bogo_ROK.pdf|title=Final Comprehensive Environmental Evaluation|last=|first=|date=April 2012|website=eng.kopri.re.kr|publisher=Korea Ppolar Research Institute|access-date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn served as the vice president of the Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) from May 2010 to June 2012. She also served as Vice President of the Korean Society of Oceanography in 2010–2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ksocean.or.kr/sub01_04.asp|title=연혁/역대회장|last=|first=|date=|website=ksocean.or.kr|publisher=Korean Society of Oceanography|language=ko|trans-title=History|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Korea Federation of Women's Science &amp; Technology Associations in 2014 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kofwst.org/|title=한국여성과학기술단체총연합회|website=www.kofwst.org|publisher=|language=ko|trans-title=Korea Federation of Women's Science &amp; Technology Associations|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was expedition leader of the 28th overwintering team (2015) of the South Korean King Sejong Antarctic station, where she served as the station chief for about a year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ahn's research interests include Antarctic marine [[benthic zone|benthic ecology]] with special interests on benthic invertebrates and monitoring on Antarctic coastal marine ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She has studied the Antarctic clam ''[[Laternula elliptica]]'', a dominant marine [[Bivalvia|bivalve]] around Antarctic Continent. Ahn's current research includes studies on the impacts of [[Glacial motion|glacier retreat]] on nearshore marine benthic communities around the King Sejong Station.

She is currently an adjunct professor at the [[Korea University of Science and Technology|University of Science &amp; Technology]] (UST), and a principal research scientist at the Korean Polar Institute (KOPRI), which forms part of Korea Institute of Ocean Science &amp; Technology (KIOST).

==Awards and honors==
The South Korean government awarded Ahn a Medal of Science &amp; Technology Merit for outstanding accomplishment in Antarctic Research in April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=101&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0000067080|title=과학기술진흥유공자 포상자 명단|date=2001|website=news.naver.com|publisher=yunhap news|trans-title=Science and Technology Merit list|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was further awarded a Commendation from the [[Ministry of Environment (South Korea)|South Korean Ministry of Environment]] in June 2008 for her contribution in the designation of Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA #171) near the King Sejong station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eng.kopri.re.kr/www/about/kopri_brochure/annual_report_2008.pdf|title=Annual Report|last=|first=|date=2008|website=kopri.re.kr|publisher=Korean Polar Research Institute|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, she additionally received South Korea's [[Orders, decorations, and medals of South Korea|Prime Minister's award]] in recognition of her achievement as the station leader at King Sejong station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ksg.co.kr/news/main_newsView.jsp?bbsID=news&amp;bbsCategory=KSG&amp;categoryCode=all&amp;backUrl=main_news&amp;pNum=108601|title=코리아쉬핑가제트|date=2016|work=Korea Shipping Gazette|trans-title=Golden Tower and Silver Tower Medals|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3485">'''InoForum''' — independent [[website|internet resource]], which searches for, translates and publishes in [[Russian language|Russian]] articles from foreign editions, first of all the ones that are political, related to [[Russia]] or the attitude towards Russia in various countries, as well as readers comments and forums. Translations are published daily.&lt;ref&gt;According to the information in the [http://www.inoforum.ru/spisok_publikacij archive of the site] (in Russian). Checked in September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the job to maintain the project is performed by volunteers from the readers of that internet resource. The job includes forming the contents (selection of articles, translating and editing), administration and technical support of the site.

==History==

The independent internet project ''Inoforum'' was established on March 11, 2009 after [[Yaroslav Ognev]] left the [[Inosmi.Ru]] and a new editor-in-chief was assigned.

It was planned, that ''Inosmi'' would broaden its informational and analytical activities, in particular, a feature of posting comments to articles would be introduced, while the comments would become a source of opinions and contents for the foreign editions. While the forum of ''Inosmi'' known in the [[Runet]] for its speech freedom and patriotically minded visitors would cease its existence, as many forum visitors were concerned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nestor.minsk.by/kg/news/2009/03/2101.html Cyberpartisans from Inoforum declared a war against Inosmi], by Pavel Brel (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|
Today media resources get more and more interested in what's called ''user generated content''... I would like the InoSmi readers to be those ''opinion makers'' that I would manage to ''trade'' in ''exchange'' for the content legalization.&lt;ref name=rian&gt;[http://www.rian.ru/news_company/20090311/164475711.html Marina Pustilnik is assigned Editor-in-Chief of InoSmi], by [[RIAN]], March 11, 2009 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''[[Marina Pustilnik]]'''
}}

A lot of ''Inosmi'' readers and forum participants did not support changes to the politics of the resource.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalisti.ru/?p=2309 Inosmi? No, Inoforum!], Journalisti.Ru (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; In their blogs and personal websites forum participants of ''Inosmi'' openly expressed their discontent with the ongoing events and took a series of actions to preserve the format of the site and of discussions they were accustomed to.

First of all, ''Inosmi'' fans were assured &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusk.ru/newsdata.php?idar=181900 Liberal revenge], by Rusk.Ru (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; that the site would cease to be the independent information source about Russia. Reminding the great role that it played in covering the [[2008 South Ossetian war]] and bringing the facts to the western readers, ''Inosmi'' fans clarified their position in the "Open letter of Inosmi forum participants":

{{cquote|We believe, that the new politics will not only cause the death of a powerful means of patriotic upbringing of a great amount of literate, educated, socially active citizens of Russia, but will also lead to establishment of the resource engaged in the dangerous, corrupting activity...}}

''Inoforum'' is the specialized site of free discussing of foreign press articles, commentaries of foreign readers and forums in foreign languages.

It was founded in 1934 under the basic teachings of [[Theodor Herzl]], [[Max Nordau]], and [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]]. As opposed to [[Histadrut]], the NLF believes in the separation of employers and trade unions.

ICTUR reports that, although the NLF disclaims political affiliations, it has been seen as sympathetic to [[Likud]]. They are well known because of their original orange and burgundy colors.

"'''Run Away'''" is a song performed by [[SunStroke Project]] and [[Olia Tira]], and represented [[Moldova]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]] in May 2010 in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. The song won the final of the ''[[Moldova in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010|O melodie pentru Europa 2010]]'', that took place on 6 March. It gained the maximum number of points from both the juries and the televotes.&lt;ref name="Moldova 1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=10103&amp;_t=Sun+Stroke+Project+%26+Olia+Tira+for+Moldova!|title=Sun Stroke Project &amp; Olia Tira for Moldova!|last=Brey|first=Marco|date=6 March 2010|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|accessdate=6 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201213753/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=10103&amp;_t=Sun+Stroke+Project+%26+Olia+Tira+for+Moldova! |archivedate=2014-02-01 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moldova 2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15314|title=Moldova sends Sunstroke Project &amp; Olia Tira to Eurovision|last=Klier|first=Marcus|date=6 March 2010|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=6 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229075036/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15314 |archivedate=2012-02-29 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the contest, it was performed first on the night of the first semi-final, preceding Russia's [[Lost and Forgotten]] and passed to the final. The inspiration for the "Epic Jazz Jive" came from observing ducks, waddling through sand, on the beach.

After the contest, "Run Away" would also become the subject of a major [[internet meme]] surrounding the [[saxophone]] solos performed by saxophonist [[Sergey Stepanov (musician)|Sergey Stepanov]] who, in a phenomenon similar to [[Rickrolling]] and [[Eduard Khil|Trololo]], was dubbed the "'''Epic Sax Guy'''" in videos on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Epic Sax Guy (The One)|url=http://www.urlesque.com/2010/07/29/epic-sax-guy/|work=URLesque|publisher=Aol|accessdate=8 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202115725/http://www.urlesque.com/2010/07/29/epic-sax-guy/ |archivedate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 2010"&gt;{{cite news |title= Is this guy the Web's new rickroll? |first= Damon |last= Brown |url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/08/02/damon.brown.epic.sax.guy/
