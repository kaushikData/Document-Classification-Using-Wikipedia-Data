The '''Amputee Coalition of America''' ('''ACA''') is a [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[Manassas, Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/amputee-coalition-relocates-headquarters-to-manassas/2012/10/09/c2e0a0a0-122a-11e2-a16b-2c110031514a_story.html|newspaper=Washington Post | first=Sarah | last=Lane|title=Amputee Coalition relocates headquarters to Manassas|date=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States of America]]. ACA's mission is to reach out to people with limb loss and empower them through education, support and advocacy.

==Outreach programs==
The ACA runs multiple programs including the following.
*'''National Limb Loss Information Center (NLLIC)'''
:The NLLIC serves as a call center for [[Team Zaryen|amputees]],friends and family members of people with limb differences, caregivers, medical professionals and others seeking information about limb loss. The NLLIC information specialists provide information resources in the form of articles, books, videos, research, and Web sites to help people find the answers they seek.

*'''Action Plan for People with Limb Loss (APPLL)'''
:The ACA has assumed the challenge to address and improve the health and care of people living with the loss or absence of a limb and those at risk for primary [[amputations]] or secondary conditions, including additional amputations. The ACA has two main goals, one comprehends the coming together of patients, providers and manufacturers to identify ways to resolve access and coverage issues for [[prosthetics]] and care for all amputees in the United States. One way to address [[insurance]] coverage issues is by promoting Insurance Parity at the State level. The ACA defines prosthetic parity as insurance companies covering appropriate prosthetic care.
:The other objective pertains to partnering with other health organizations to promote [[health]]ful [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]], which can prevent primary amputations and secondary conditions that can result in additional amputations.

*'''National Peer Network (NPN)''' 
:The National Peer Network is a network of support groups and trained, certified peer visitors that meet with soon-to-be or recent amputees to answer questions, and build a mentoring relationship.

*'''Youth Activities Program (YAP)'''
:The Amputee Coalition's Youth Activities Program hosts a residential camp for children with limb loss or limb difference each year.  The camp includes [[recreation]]al activities such as [[canoeing]], [[human swimming|swimming]], educational sessions such as [[nutrition]] and offers peer support through peer circles and support group sessions.

==Publications==
The Amputee Coalition of America publishes many award-winning publications including ''inMotion'' [[magazine]], published 6 times per year, and ''First Step: A Guide for Adapting to Limb Loss'', published every other year and available in both [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Another one-time publication is ''SideStep: A Guide to Preventing and Managing [[Diabetes]]''.

The Youth Activities Program has an online e-zine called [http://www.amputee-coalition.org/yaz YAZ (Youth Amputee e-Zine)].

'''Astronomy Picture of the Day''' ('''APOD''') is a [[website]] provided by [[NASA]] and [[Michigan Technological University]] (MTU). According to the website, "Each day a different image or [[photograph]] of our [[universe]] is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional [[astronomer]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Nemiroff|first=Robert|author2=Jerry Bonnell|title=APOD homepage|publisher=NASA|date=April 3, 2007|url=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/|accessdate=December 30, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101229011541/http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/| archivedate= 29 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The photograph does not necessarily correspond to a celestial event on the exact day that it is displayed, and images are sometimes repeated.&lt;ref name="APODFAQ"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Nemiroff|first=Robert|author2=Jerry Bonnell|title=APOD Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=NASA|url=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap_faq.html|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the pictures and descriptions often relate to current events in astronomy and [[space exploration]]. The text has several hyperlinks to more pictures and websites for more information. The images are either [[visible spectrum]] photographs, images taken at non-visible [[wavelengths]] and displayed in [[false color]], video footage, animations, artist’s conceptions, or [[micrograph]]s that relate to space or cosmology. Past images are stored in the APOD Archive, with the first image appearing on June 16, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD|title=Neutron Star Earth|date=16 June 1995|accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative has received support from NASA, the [[National Science Foundation]], and MTU. The images are sometimes authored by people or organizations outside NASA, and therefore APOD images are often [[copyright]]ed, unlike many other NASA image galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Nemiroff|first=Robert|author2=Jerry Bonnell|title=About APOD Image Permissions|publisher=NASA|url=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html#srapply|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When APOD began it received only 14 page views on its first day. As of 2012 it had received over a billion image views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD|title=APOD Turns 17|date=16 June 2012|access-date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; APOD is also translated into 21 languages daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=About APOD|publisher=APOD|url=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/about_apod.html|accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APOD was presented at a meeting of the [[American Astronomical Society]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=AAS Meeting 187th Program |publisher=American Astronomical Society |date=1996 |url=http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v27n4/aas187/S005006.html |accessdate=April 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907221350/http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v27n4/aas187/S005006.html |archivedate=September 7, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its practice of using [[hypertext]]&lt;ref name="APODFAQ"/&gt; was analyzed in a paper in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Carr|first=Leslie|first2=Wendy|last2=Hall|first3=Timothy|last3=Miles-Board|title=Writing and Reading Hypermedia on the Web|publisher=Technical Report, Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton|date=February 29, 2000|url=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/2643/01/WRWH.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211104513/http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/2643/01/WRWH.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 11, 2005|accessdate=April 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received a ''[[Scientific American]]'' Sci/Tech Web Award in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sci/Tech Web Awards 2001—Astronomy and Astrophysics|publisher=Scientific American|date=May 14, 2001|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00049BA0-DDBD-1CF3-93F6809EC5880000|accessdate=April 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the website was featured in an interview with Nemiroff on [[CNN]] ''Saturday Morning News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Saturday Morning News — Astronomy Picture of Day transcript|publisher=CNN|date=September 21, 2002|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0209/21/smn.06.html|accessdate=April 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the two authors published a book titled ''The Universe: 365 Days''&lt;ref&gt;The Universe: 365 Days: Robert J. Nemiroff, Jerry T. Bonnell: Books&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Harry N. Abrams]], which is a collection of the best images from APOD as a hardcover [[Coffee table book|"coffee table" style]] book. APOD was the Featured Collection in the November 2004 issue of ''[[D-Lib Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Bonita|title=Featured Collection|journal=D-Lib Magazine|volume=10|issue=11|date=November 2004|doi=10.1045/november2004-featured.collectiones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]], APOD continued its service on [[mirror website|mirror sites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=32210|title=How to follow APOD during a US government shutdown - Starship Asterisk*|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://asterisk.apod.com/library/APOD/APOD%20mirror/APOD%20Asterisk%20Mirror.html APOD mirror] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003185001/http://asterisk.apod.com/library/APOD/APOD%20mirror/APOD%20Asterisk%20Mirror.html |date=October 3, 2013 }} accessdate October, 4th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Robert J. Nemiroff]] and Dr. Jerry T. Bonnell were awarded the 2015 [[Klumpke-Roberts Award]] by the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] "for outstanding contributions to public understanding and appreciation of astronomy" for their work on APOD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrosociety.org/about-us/klumpke-roberts-award-of-the-astronomical-society-of-the-pacific/|title=Klumpke-Roberts Award of The Astronomical Society of the Pacific|publisher=Astronomical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.astrosociety.org/society-news/the-astronomical-society-of-the-pacific-announces-its-2015-award-recipients-for-astronomy-research-and-education/#klumpke|title=The Astronomical Society of the Pacific Announces Its 2015 Award Recipients For Astronomy Research And Education|publisher=Astronomical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located on [[Bulevar kralja Aleksandra|King Alexander Boulevard]], close to the [[Belgrade Law School|Faculty of Law]] and adjacent to the Faculties of Civil Engineering, [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering|Electrical Engineering]], and [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Architecture|Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bg.ac.rs/eng/memb/en_biblioteka.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012171642/http://www.bg.ac.rs/eng/memb/en_biblioteka.php |archivedate=12 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serves the educational and scientific needs of students, academics, and scientists. ''Library Day'' is the 24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May, a day commemorating [[Slavs|Slavic]] educators [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|St. Cyril and Methodius]].
At the founding of the Library, the collection contained 57,254 publications consisting of [[monographs]] and [[Periodical publication|serials]]. Today, the library contains roughly 1,700,000 publications.

The library holdings include seminal works from all scientific fields, a large collection of local and foreign [[encyclopedias]], [[bibliographies]], [[dictionaries]], professional and [[scientific journals]], university publications, textbooks, and a significant collection of doctoral dissertations. The library also includes a collection of rare objects where [[manuscripts]], old printed books, old magazines and newspapers, archival collections, as well as a collection of [[map]]s, [[doctoral]], master's and specialist works are housed. In particular in the library's manuscript collection, there are several invaluable Cyrillic and oriental books.

== History ==
[[File:Стари рукопис.jpg|thumbnail|right|Old manuscripts]]
The University Library, one of the largest research libraries in the [[Balkans]] serving the educational and research needs of its academic population, originates from the library of the [[Lyceum]] of the [[Principality of Serbia]]. Established in 1838, the Lyceum was considered the best school in [[Serbia]] at the time and had a library that was used by its professors and students as well as by students of the [[Belgrade Higher School]]. Its funds were made up of gifts from local and foreign donors, and a sample copy of the Principality of Serbia. According to the provisions for establishing the Lyceum, the librarian had to be one of its teachers, the first of which was Dr. Janko Šafarik (1814–1876), philologist and professor of history. The Library in 1850 had 927 volumes.

Belgrade Lyceum of the Principality of Serbia was converted into the [[Belgrade Higher School]] by the law of 24 September 1863. The school's library kept only professional publications, while others publications were handed over to the [[National Library of Serbia|National Library]]. When in 1905 the Belgrade Higher School became the University library, the library was disbanded. The funds, according to scientific fields, were divided by the appropriate faculty seminars. The most valuable part of the collection went to the library of Serbian seminars. Soon it was realized that the university required a general scientific library, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] delayed its establishment. Part of this fund were received after establishing the University Library.
[[File:Уметнички центар.jpg|thumbnail|right|Art center in the Library]]

After the war, because of the great suffering of Serbian libraries, from abroad books began to arrive in large numbers to the address of the University Library, although she was only established until January 1921. Since the proposal for a decision of the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]], adopted by the University Senate, came from prof. Pavle Popović, and he was appointed head of the ''Commission for the establishment of the University Library''. Shortly thereafter, in May 1921, prof. Uros Džonić was appointed trustee of the University Library, whom was temporarily given an office at the Faculty of Philosophy.

On the initiative of Serbian delegates in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Dr. Slavko Grujić, [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], who had already built a series of libraries in the world, has agreed to approve $100,000 as a gift to the Serbian government to build and equip a library in [[Belgrade]]. After [[World War I]], Belgrade was one of three "front-line" cities, badly damaged in the war, which were given a [[Carnegie library]], the other two being [[Carnegie Library of Reims|Reims]] in France (which received a city library) and [[Leuven]] in Belgium (which received a university library). Belgrade's university library is the only Carnegie library in [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report / Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|publisher=BiblioLife|isbn=9781110041473|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nIdzbThGS_MC|page=37|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor Slobodan Jovanović, former Rector of the University, managed personal commitment to the material means increase by government loans, in order to build a larger library, to meet the needs of the University. City of Belgrade has donated land, and the project was done by university professors, architects Dragutin Đordjević and Nikola Nestorović. So is built first and then the only building in Serbia, purpose-built for the library.

The library in a new building was officially opened on [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|St. Cyril and Methodius]], 24 May 1926. Professor Uros Džonić remained at the position of the Administrator to the beginning of the [[Second World War]]. In this work he was assisted by a committee whose president was prof. Dr. Pavle Popović. The main task of this institution was that "as an independent university institution helps cultivate the science and in the capacity of research libraries serve not only students and faculty of Belgrade University, but also to all those involved in science." During World War II, under [[German occupation of Yugoslavia|German occupation]], the library did not work with the audience, and part of the building was occupied by the German army. Through the efforts of the staff of the library, its collections are still preserved. After liberation, the trustee is set to be Milica Prodanović, former librarian of the University Library. To celebrate the centenary of the birth of [[Svetozar Marković]] in 1946, this institution received its present name of the University Library "Svetozar Markovic".

In the period after the Second World War began the application of modern methods in the organization and processing of funds. A public professional directory was formed, in collaboration with the [[National Library of Serbia]] made a rule book for cataloging by the [[Association of Librarians of Serbia]], which marked the beginning of equalization processing of library materials in the library of Serbia. Contacts were established with university and national libraries in the country and abroad. It also embarked on an aggressive work sharing and [[interlibrary loan]] publications. A service for information was formed and cooperation with the universities, seminaries, institutes and other libraries of the University of Belgrade was expanded.

== Department of Scientific Information and education ==
'''Department for Scientific Information''' was transformed in 2008 into the '''Department of scientific information and education'''. This section traces the development of the system of scientific information and communication, browsing databases from all scientific fields. The main activity of the department is information literacy, particularly undergraduate and graduate students, preparing materials for different types of education tailored to specific user groups, work on continuous professional development, professional organization of librarians of university libraries in Serbia, academic libraries as well as library research institutes and institutions. The Department prepares informants, guides and other informational materials about the library, preparing informational materials for the library website; engaged in the research and analysis within the field of information science, in accordance with the requirements and needs of universities and other users; collaborating on the development of library and information systems and scientific and technological information on universities in Serbia and in the system of coordinated procurement publications in print and electronic form; developing international cooperation.

The Library has developed an educational program that organizes and implements department for scientific information and education, and library specialists from other departments. As a parent institution organizes special workshops for librarians, faculty, and research institutions. Particular attention is paid to the education of young researchers at master's and doctoral studies. Education is organized in the library, as well as abroad, at universities and institutes, members of the University of Belgrade, but also in universities and research institutions throughout Serbia. Thanks to this, the number of downloaded articles from electronic services available through CoBSON-a (''Serbian Library Consortium for Coordinated Acquisition'') each year is increasing, and the number of examined and partially downloaded [[e-books]]. Educational programs are varied and adapted to the learners.

The library organizes lectures by prominent international scholars and professionals dedicated to the scientific community of Serbia and librarians academic library network. Organized by the Library, in collaboration with other institutions of the University of Belgrade, has been held for more than 20 of these lectures via [[video link]] or live, with speakers from the EU, the US and the region.

=== Education ===
Department of Scientific Information and education by 2002 trained individual users, but has since started an organized training users in the form of group training such as [[presentations]], lectures, interactive [[workshops]] and so on. The first group training were within the [[TEMPUS]] project, the target population consisted of academic librarians in the organization of the ''Community of Libraries of the University of Serbia''. Within the Community over the years have been organized various lectures and workshops on the themes established by the interest and needs of the user, and from 2014 to maintain accredited course "Information Literacy in Libraries: commercial and non-commercial electronic information sources," in accordance with the Regulations of the [[Ministry of culture and Information of the Republic of Serbia]] that contribute to the evaluation of the librarian, and thus the improvement of the profession. The establishment '''CoBSON''' one of the most important activities of the department were numerous presentations and lectures are held at most colleges and institutes of the University of Belgrade as well as institutions throughout the country.

Most of the presentations and lectures are available on the website of the University Library.

=== Guides for scientific field – LibGuides ===
'''LibGuides''' is a new type of [[multimedia]], interactive [[web guide]] to all [[scientific fields]]. What was formerly called the reference links are now in a much clearer, more organized, meaningful and attractive way to achieve this library guides.

It is a web service that enables authorized users, librarians, without prior knowledge of web design to successfully and easily create, organize and update [[Web pages]]. The main objective of this is to provide in one place access to reliable electronic sources – commercial and those in [[open access]]. For each scientific discipline, in addition to texts, images, video recordings, are available and useful links to associations, conferences and other current information. LibGuides uses about 50,000 librarians in over 3,700 libraries worldwide. Created about 300,000 guides. Also, this guide allows you to download already existing guides from all over the community and work together more librarians in making guides.

=== Interlibrary loan ===
[[File:Примерак ретке књиге.JPG|thumbnail|right|An example of a rare book from library collection]]
The tendency in the development of modern librarianship is that the prospective user of a library in the country, at the same time become a user of all public libraries in the world. Thanks to '''interlibrary loan''', which inevitably must follow the latest trends of the modern information society that relies increasingly on electronic forms of communication, greatly shortens the time required to obtain accurate and adequate information, bringing a sense of physical distance and the presence of the sources of information and users.

The purpose of local interlibrary loan identified primarily in meeting the demands and needs of the user – library, both for information and for their sources in different fields of science, culture and art. In addition, it is necessary to understand the needs and structure of the user to be in line with the dynamics of providing information, which again must be the result of more efficient activities of the department that deals with interlibrary loans. Changes in the expectations, requirements and user type affected the interlibrary loan in the University Library "Svetozar Marković", which represents the connection between classical or physical and digital lending, reflecting both the dual nature of the modern library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4094">The '''Chorus Association of Venetian Churches''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Chorus Associazione per le Chiese del Patriarcato di Venezia''), often shortened to '''Chorus Association''', is a [[Conservation movement|conservation]] organisation working within the city of [[Venice]] in [[Italy]]. It works to safeguard, conserve and restore the artistic, historical and cultural heritage contained within the sixteen Venetian churches that presently constitute its membership. 

==Project==
Chorus was founded in June 1997, set-up by public act as a [[non-profit]] association. Its initial members were the priests and rectors of the thirteen founding churches. It was added to [[Venice City Council]]'s Register of Associations in August 1997 and in December 1999 the [[Veneto Region]] recognised it as a legal entity in accordance with Italian Civil Code.&lt;ref name="chorus-project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chorusvenezia.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=6&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=3|title=The Project| publisher=Chorus Association|accessdate=15 Dec 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Cass di Risparmio di Venezia Foundation joined Chorus along with a number of lay persons. The total membership currently stands at nineteen.&lt;ref name="chorus-project" /&gt;

Chorus brings together a network of 16 of Venice’s churches (see list below) which between them house more than a thousand works of art. The concept has been defined as an "area museum" and is run such that the latest conservation practices are applied across the network. The project also follows the concept of "conservation through utilisation" whereby the demand from visitors to view the cultural history on offer is translated into self-financing so that maintenance, conservation and valorisation of the history, artwork and heritage can continue to take place.&lt;ref name="chorus-project" /&gt;

==Members==
The 18 churches which are presently members of the Chorus Association are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chorusvenezia.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=7|title=Churches|publisher=Chorus Association|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community mobilization''' is an attempt to bring both human and non-human resources together to undertake developmental activities in order to achieve [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | url = http://www.wcdorissa.gov.in/download/Final-5.0.pdf
  | pages = 197–205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Community mobilization is a process through which action is stimulated by a [[community]] itself, or by others, that is planned, carried out, and evaluated by a community’s individuals, groups, and organizations on a participatory and sustained basis to improve the health, hygiene and education levels so as to enhance the overall [[standard of living]] in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

A group of people have transcended their differences to meet on equal terms in order to facilitate a participatory [[decision-making]] process. In other words, it can be viewed as a process which begins a [[dialogue]] among members of the community to determine who, what, and how issues are decided, and also to provide an avenue for everyone to participate in decisions that affect their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
Community mobilization needs many analytical and supportive resources which are internal (inside the community) and external (outside the community) as well. Resources include:
* [[Leadership]]
* Organizational capacity
* Communications channels
* Assessments
* [[Problem solving]]
* [[Resource mobilization]]
* Administrative and operational management

== Strategies ==
The [[Centre for Disease Control]] envisions that strong healthcare initiatives will be readily owned by a community if the leaders ("grass tops"), the citizens ("[[Grassroots|grass roots"]]), and youth are fully [[Community engagement|engaged]] in mobilizing the community, educating stakeholders, and implementing [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based]] interventions.
To this respect, 14 strategies guided by best practice have been reported (Huberman 2014):

1. Secure strong leadership 

2. Establish a formal structure 

3. Engage diverse organizations, community leaders, and residents

4. Ensure authentic participation and shared decision making

5.ensure authentic and productive roles for young people 

6. Develop a shared vision 

7. Conduct a needs assessment 

8. Create a strategic plan 

9. Implement mutually reinforcing strategies 

10. Create a fundraising strategy 

11. Establish effective channels for internal communication 

12. Educate the community 

13. Conduct process and outcome evaluations 

14. Evaluate the community mobilization effort separately 

==Implications==
"Community mobilization" is a frequently used term in developmental sector. Recently, community mobilization has been proved to be a valuable and effective concept which has various implications in dealing with basic problems like health and hygiene, population, pollution and gender bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Condom fatigue''' is a term used by medical professionals and [[safer sex]] educators to refer to the phenomenon of decreased condom use. It can also be used to describe a general weariness of and decreased effectiveness of safer sex messages. This is sometimes called "prevention fatigue".

The term has particularly been used to describe [[men who have sex with men]], though the term applies to people of all [[gender]]s and [[sexual orientation]]s.  Condom fatigue has been partially blamed for an increase in [[HIV]] infection rates, though this has not been substantiated in any study.

Condom fatigue is not a universal phenomenon. In Germany, condom use between new sexual partners has increased between 1994 and 2010 from 65% to 87%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bzga.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/hohes-schutzniveau-bei-hiv-aids-schutz-gegen-sexuell-uebertragbare-krankheiten-immer-wichtiger/|title=BZgA : Pressemitteilungen|first=Die Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche|last=Aufklärung|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was Joseph Eisen, born in the province of Galicia, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and his mother was Pauline Greenberg Eisen, born in Holyoke, Massachusetts to a father from New York and a mother from the Russian Empire, now southern Ukraine.  He graduated from the [[Juilliard School of Music]] (in 1948) and from [[Columbia University]]. A [[Fulbright scholarship]] enabled him to pursue further vocal studies in Austria at the [[Mozarteum University of Salzburg|Salzburg Mozarteum]] and in Italy at the [[Accademia Chigiana]] and the [[Accademia Santa Cecilia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Opera Canada]]'' (1988). [https://books.google.com/books?id=liwKAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Daniel+Ferro%22 Volumes 29-30], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Early in his career he changed his surname from Eisen, the German word for [[iron]], to Ferro, the Italian word for iron.

During the early 1950s, Ferro was member of the [[Graz Opera|Graz Opera Company]] in Austria where his appearances included ''[[Mathis der Maler (opera)|Mathis der Maler]]'' (Truchsess von Waldburg) and ''[[Parsifal]]'' (Titurel).&lt;ref&gt;List, Rudolf (1966).

Oberösterreichischer Landesverlag {{icon de}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared on European concert stages and toured with the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]]. When Ferro returned to the United States in 1956, he took up an appointment as Associate Professor in the voice department at [[Butler University]] in Indiana. The 1960s found him in back in New York City, teaching at [[Hunter College]] and later at the [[Manhattan School of Music]] where he became chairman of the voice department. During that time, he also performed in both musical theatre and opera, including leading roles in musicals with [[Music Circus|St. John Terrell's Company]] and other [[summer stock theatre]]s, a revival of ''[[The Saint of Bleecker Street]]'' in New York City,  and concert performances of ''[[Werther]]'' in [[Carnegie Hall]] and ''[[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]]'' at [[Avery Fisher Hall|Lincoln Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Lambertville-Music-Circus.org.

"Massenet Opera is Revived Here; 'Werther' is Given its First Performance Since 1948".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Ferro joined the faculty of the Juilliard School, a post he held until his retirement as "vocal faculty emeritus" in 2006, after which he continued to give [[master class]]es there. However, his voice teaching extended far beyond Juilliard, both through his private voice studio in New York, and his master classes at many of the world's conservatories, including the [[Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal|Conservatoire de musique, Montréal]], [[Royal Conservatory of Music]] in Toronto, [[Shanghai Conservatory of Music]], [[Royal College of Music, Stockholm]], [[Manhattan School of Music]], and the Accademia Chigiana, where he was once a student. In France, he taught at the [[Opéra de Paris]], [[Paris Conservatory]], and [[Royaumont Abbey|Fondation Royaumont]]; in 1988, he was made an [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French government for his services to music.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ferro Vocal Program (Greve in Chianti, Italy).

The '''Department for Education''' ('''DfE''') is a [[British government departments|department of Her Majesty's Government]] responsible for [[child protection]], [[Education in England|education]] (compulsory, further and higher education), apprenticeships and wider skills in England. 

A Department for Education previously existed between 1992, when the [[Department of Education and Science]] was renamed, and 1995 when it was merged with the [[Department for Work and Pensions|Department for Employment]] to become the [[Department for Education and Employment]].

==History==

The DfE was formed on 12 May 2010 by the incoming [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Cameron ministry]], taking on the responsibilities and resources of the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] (DCSF).

In June 2012 the Department for Education committed a breach of the UK's [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] due to a security flaw on its website which made email addresses, passwords and comments of people responding to consultation documents available for download.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=ICO: Education ministry BROKE the Data Protection Act|last=Fiveash|first=Kelly|publisher=The Register|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/19/department_for_education_breaks_data_protection_act_after_online_smut_consultation_system_leaks_sensitive_details_of_respondents/|date=19 October 2012|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, the Department took over responsibilities for higher and further education and for apprenticeship from the dissolved [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]].&lt;ref name="CSW"&gt;Matt Foster, [https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/new-department-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy-swallows-decc-and-bis-%E2%80%94-full New Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy swallows up DECC and BIS — full details and reaction], ''Civil Service World'' (14 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National College for Teaching and Leadership]] (NCTL) is responsible for administering the training of new and existing teachers in England, as well as the regulation of the teaching profession and offers headteachers, school leaders and senior children's services leaders opportunities for professional development. It was established on 1 April 2013, when the [[Teaching Agency]] (which replaced the [[Training and Development Agency for Schools]] and parts of the [[General Teaching Council for England]]) merged with the [[National College for School Leadership]]. 
The National College for Teaching and Leadership was replaced by the Department for Education and Teaching Regulation Agency in April 2018.

====Standards and Testing Agency====
The [[Standards and Testing Agency]] (STA) is responsible for developing and delivering all statutory assessments for school pupils in [[Education in England|England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.education.gov.uk/aboutdfe/armslengthbodies/b00198511/sta |title=Standards and Testing Agency |publisher= Department for Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed on 1 October 2011 and took over the functions of the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency]]. The STA is regulated by the examinations regulator, [[Ofqual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.education.gov.uk/aboutdfe/armslengthbodies/b00198511/sta/feedback-and-complaints |title=STA Feedback and complaints |publisher= Department for Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devolution==
Education, youth and children's policy is devolved elsewhere in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].
The department's main devolved counterparts are as follows:

'''[[Scotland]]'''

*[[Scottish Government]] – [[Scottish Government Learning and Justice Directorates|Learning and Justice Directorates]]

'''[[Northern Ireland]]'''
* [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Department of Education]]
* [[Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister]] (children and young people)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/equality/children-young-people.htm OFMDFM Children and young people]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Curriculum 2014==
The Department for Education released a new [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] for schools in England for September 2014, which included 'Computing'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Michael Gove]]'s speech in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/michael-gove-speech-at-the-bett-show-2012&lt;/ref&gt; the subject of Information Communication Technology (ICT) has been disapplied and replaced by Computing. With the new curriculum, materials have been written by commercial companies, to support non-specialist teachers, for example, '[[100 Computing Lessons]]' by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]. The Computing at Schools organisation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; has created a 'Network of Teaching Excellence'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/index.php?id=noe&lt;/ref&gt; to support schools with the new curriculum.{{deadlink|date=January 2018}}

==Post-16 area reviews==
In 2015, the Department announced a major restructuring of the [[further education]] sector, through 37 area reviews of [[Further education#United Kingdom|post-16]] provision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reviewing-post-16-education-and-training-institutions-list-of-area-reviews/reviewing-post-16-education-and-training-institutions-area-reviews-waves-1-to-5] Department for Education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65221">A '''diploma mill''' (also known as a '''degree mill''') is a company or organization that claims to be a higher education institution  but provides illegitimate [[academic degree]]s and [[diploma]]s for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/diplomamills |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208102212/https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/diplomamills |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/students/prep/college/diplomamills/diploma-mills.html|title=Diploma Mills and Accreditation - Diploma Mills|date=23 December 2009|website=www2.ed.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; These degrees may claim to give credit for relevant life experience, but should not be confused with legitimate [[prior learning assessment]] programs.  They may also claim to evaluate work history or require submission of a thesis or dissertation for evaluation to give an appearance of authenticity.&lt;ref name="transcriptresearch.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bogus Institutions and Accrediting Bodies|url=http://www.transcriptresearch.com/Bogus.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diploma mills are frequently supported by [[accreditation mill]]s, set up for the purpose of providing an appearance of authenticity.&lt;ref name=Lantero&gt;Luca Lantero, [http://www.cimea.it/files/fileusers/Diploma_mills_Luca_Lantero_EN.pdf Degree Mills: non-accredited and irregular higher education institutions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513185433/http://www.cimea.it/files/fileusers/Diploma_mills_Luca_Lantero_EN.pdf |date=2015-05-13 }}, [[Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence|Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence (CIMEA)]], Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also be used pejoratively to describe an accredited institution with low academic admission standards and a low job placement rate. An individual may or may not be aware that the degree they have obtained is not wholly legitimate. In either case, legal issues can arise if the qualification is used in [[résumé]]s.

==Terminology==
The term "diploma mill" originally denotes an institution providing diplomas on an intensive and profit-making basis, like a [[factory]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |url        = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/118469?redirectedFrom=diploma+mill#eid36876996
 |title      = mill 1 n.
 |work       = [[Oxford English Dictionary]]
 |edition    = 3rd
 |accessdate = November 30, 2012
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, it describes any institution that offers qualifications which are not accredited nor based on proper academic assessment.

While the terms "degree mill" and "diploma mill" are commonly used interchangeably, within the academic community a distinction is sometimes drawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/March-April%202009/abstract-real-and-fake.html "The Real and the Fake: Degree and Diploma Mills"],  [[Alan Contreras]] and [[George Gollin]], ''Change'', March–April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A "degree mill" issues diplomas from unaccredited institutions which may be legal in some states but are generally illegitimate, while a "diploma mill" issues counterfeit diplomas bearing the names of real universities.

Academic diplomas may be legitimately awarded without any study as a recognition of authority or experience. When given extraordinarily, such degrees are called [[honorary degree]]s or ''honoris causa'' degrees. Also, in some universities, holders of a lower degree (such as a [[bachelor's degree]]) may be routinely awarded honorary higher degrees (such as a [[master's degree]]) without study.

The term "diploma mill" may also be used pejoratively to describe a legitimate institution with low academic admission standards and a low job placement rate, such as [[for-profit school]]s.&lt;ref name="Lantero"/&gt;

Related practices are direct [[document forgery]] of certificates and corrupt buying of degrees from otherwise legitimate universities, although neither require a separate "mill".

==Characteristics==
Diploma mills share a number of features that differentiate them from respected institutions, although some legitimate institutions may exhibit some of the same characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/alerts/article.asp?ID=185 | title=Is the U.S. becoming a haven for diploma mills? | author=BBB | work=bbb.org | publisher=Council of Better Business Bureaus | date=July 12, 2000 |accessdate=2010-07-01| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031031032931/http://www.bbb.org/alerts/article.asp?ID=185 | archivedate = 2003-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accreditation and authenticity===
{{See also|Accreditation mill}}
The most notable feature of diploma mills is that they lack [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] by a nationally recognized accrediting agency. (Note, however, that not all [[unaccredited institutions of higher learning]] are diploma mills). Diploma mills therefore employ various tactics in an attempt to appear more legitimate to potential students.

Some diploma mills claim accreditation by an accreditation mill while referring to themselves as being "fully accredited".  Accreditation mills based in the United States may model their websites after real accrediting agencies overseen by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA). Another typical ploy is for mills to claim to be internationally recognized by organizations such as [[UNESCO]]. UNESCO has no authority to recognize or accredit higher education institutions or agencies, and has published warnings against education organizations that claim UNESCO recognition or affiliation.&lt;ref name="Lantero"/&gt;

Some diploma and degree mills have played a role in creating unrecognized accrediting bodies as well.  These diploma and degree mills may further confuse matters by claiming to consider work history, professional education, and previous learning, and may even require the submission of a [[dissertation]] or [[thesis]] in order to give an added appearance of legitimacy.&lt;ref name="transcriptresearch.com"/&gt;

As diploma mills are typically [[Business license|licensed to do business]], it is common practice within the industry to misrepresent their business license as indicating government approval of the institution.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Promotional materials may use words denoting a legal status such as "licensed", "state authorized", or "state-approved" to suggest an equivalence to accreditation.

Some advertise other indicators of authenticity that are not relevant to academic credentials. For example, the University of Northern Washington advertises that its degrees are "attested and sealed for authenticity by a government appointed [[notary public|notary]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unw.edu/Accred.htm |title=University of Northern Washington Accreditation | publisher=University of Northern Washington |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523172454/http://www.unw.edu/Accred.htm| archivedate=2008-05-23 |accessdate= 2010-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality notarization only certifies that the document was signed by the person named.

Diploma mills are frequently named to sound confusingly similar to those of prestigious [[educational accreditation|accredited]] academic institutions.&lt;ref name=foxnews2009&gt;[[Associated Press|AP]] (January 28, 2009). [http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2009Jan28/0,4675,OnlineEducationGlance,00.html "5 signs your school might be a diploma mill"]. ''foxnews.com''; [[News Corp]]. Retrieved 2010-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the fact that [[trademark law]] is intended to prevent this situation, diploma mills continue to employ various methods to avoid [[legal recourse]]. Several diploma mills have adopted British-sounding names, similar but not identical to the names of legitimate universities, apparently to take advantage of the United Kingdom's reputation for educational quality in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name=UKallure&gt;Melanie Newman, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=208627&amp;sectioncode=26 Degree mills bank on allure of UK names], ''[[Times Higher Education]]'', 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Some examples of British-sounding names used by diploma mills are "Shaftesbury University", "University of Dunham", "Redding University", and "Suffield University".&lt;ref name=UKallure/&gt;

The school's website may well not have an [[.edu]] domain, or other country-specific equivalent, since registration of such names is typically restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url          = http://net.educause.edu/edudomain/show_faq.asp?code=EDUELIGIBILITY

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, enforcement has sometimes been less restrictive, and an .edu domain cannot be taken as verification of school quality or reputation. Some diploma mills use an [[.ac]] top-level domain name, which resembles genuine second-level academic domain names like [[ac.uk]] but is in fact the [[ccTLD]] for [[Ascension Island]]. To prevent misuse of their names in this way, some legitimate academic institutions have registered .ac domains.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Teaching===
Compared to legitimate institutions, diploma mills tend to have drastically lowered academic requirements, if any at all. Depending on the institution, students may be required to purchase textbooks, take tests, and submit homework, but degrees are commonly conferred after little or no study.

Instead of "[[hard sciences]]", where competence is easier to verify, the subjects offered by a diploma mill are often [[esoteric]] and may be based on a [[pseudoscience]] like [[astrology]] or [[naturopathy]]. Such subjects are only vaguely defined, making external verification of educational standards difficult.

Degree mills typically offer little or no interaction with professors. Even if comments and corrections to coursework are given, they may have no bearing on the degree which is awarded. In other cases professors may serve only to write compliments to the student that can be given as references.

===Facilities===
Since diploma mills provide little in the way of teaching, there is usually no need for teaching facilities. The school tends to have no library, personnel, publications or research. In short, very little that is tangible can be found about the institution.&lt;ref name="military"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/education/finding-a-school/fraudulent-degrees-are-big-business.html|title=Fraudulent Degrees Are Big Business|work=Military.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="classbase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classbase.com/News/beware-of-diploma-mill-degrees-8|title=Beware of Diploma Mill Degrees|work=classbase.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="getb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getbschooled.typepad.com/getbschooled/2012/04/diploma-and-accreditation-mills-what-to-watch-for.html|title=Warning Signs of Possible Diploma Mills - Get B-Schooled|work=typepad.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031085709/http://getbschooled.typepad.com/getbschooled/2012/04/diploma-and-accreditation-mills-what-to-watch-for.html|archivedate=2015-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If teaching is offered, the professors may themselves hold advanced degrees from the diploma mill itself or from other unaccredited institutions. They may also sport legitimate qualifications that are unrelated to the subject they teach.

Doctoral theses and dissertations from the institution will not be available from [[University Microfilms International]], a national repository, or even the institution's own library, if it has one. The address given by the bogus institution is often a postal box, mail forwarding service or suite number.&lt;ref name=foxnews2009/&gt; There are legitimate distance learning institutions with limited facilities, however, but legitimate universities make their authority clear.&lt;ref name="getb" /&gt; For academics, publications in [[Scientific journal|peer-reviewed scientific journals]] are important for establishing scientific credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://validatingmichael.com/Michael_Teachings/2010/07/30/diploma-mills|title=Diploma Mills|work=Validating Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in diploma mills, the research is either absent, fake or purely self-published without any external review.&lt;ref&gt;See for example http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/clayton.html&lt;/ref&gt; This may be unfortunately hard to spot, since fake journals also exist. Faculty pages with bios and research may even be stolen from legitimate universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gradschool.about.com/od/distanceeducation/a/How-To-Spot-A-Diploma-Mill.htm|title=How to Spot a Diploma Mill: 12 Signs|author=Tara Kuther|work=About.com Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotion and fees===
Buyers often use the diplomas to claim academic credentials for use in securing employment. For example, a [[schoolteacher]] might buy a degree from a diploma mill in order to advance to [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]]. Degrees from a diploma mill can be obtained within a few days, weeks or months from the time of enrollment, and back-dating is possible.&lt;ref name=foxnews2009/&gt; Academic credit may be offered for "life experience," a point often featured heavily in the selling points of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christine |last=Lagorio |title=Diploma Mill Calling: Continuing Ed Without the Ed |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/education/edlife/diplomamill.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with legitimate programs offering [[recognition of prior learning]], which allow students to gain academic credit based on past training, experience or independent study. This will usually require a test that the student can fail; a diploma mill will grant the degree regardless of results.

Tuition and fees are charged on a per-degree basis rather than by term or by course.&lt;ref name=foxnews2009/&gt; Diploma mills are often advertised using [[e-mail spam]] or other questionable methods. Legitimate institutions use traditional advertising and high school recruitment. Prospective students are encouraged to "enroll now" before tuition or fees are increased. They may be told that they qualify for a fellowship, scholarship or grant, or offered deals to sign up for multiple degrees at the same time.&lt;ref name=foxnews2009/&gt; Promotional literature might contain grammatical and spelling errors, words in Latin, extravagant or pretentious language, and sample diplomas. The school's website may look amateurish or unprofessionally made.

==Legal considerations==
Degrees and diplomas issued by diploma mills have been used to obtain employment, raises, or clients. Even if issuing or receiving a diploma mill qualification is legal, passing it off as an accredited one for personal gain is a [[crime]] in many jurisdictions. In some cases the diploma mill may itself be guilty of an [[offense (law)|offense]], if it knew or ought to have known that the qualifications it issues are used for fraudulent purposes. Diploma mills could also be guilty of [[fraud]] if they mislead customers into believing that the qualifications they issue are accredited or recognized, or make false claims that they will lead to career advancement, and accept money on the basis of these claims.

Similar to [[tax havens]], diploma mills frequently employ [[jurisdiction shopping]], operating in another country or legal jurisdiction where running diploma mills is legal, standards are lax or prosecution is unlikely. Splitting the business across jurisdictions can be a way to avoid authorities. A school might operate in one jurisdiction but use a mailing address in a different jurisdiction, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Navarrete, Erika and Wilson, Jaryd (May 26, 2009).

Author [[John Bear]], a [[distance education|distance learning]] and diploma mills expert, has written that fake degrees are risky for buyers and consumers:

: "It is like putting a time bomb in your résumé. It could go off at any time, with dire consequences. The people who sell fake degrees will probably never suffer at all, but the people who buy them often suffer mightily. And – particularly if their "degree" is health-related – their clients may be seriously harmed."&lt;ref name="bear"&gt;{{Cite book

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], it is a criminal offence to call an institution a university, or issue university degrees, without authorisation through an act of federal or state parliaments.

Under the [[Higher Education Support Act 2003]], corporations wishing to use the term "university" require approval from the relevant government minister, the [[Minister for Education (Australia)|Minister for Education]] ({{as of|2010|May|lc=y}}).

The corporate regulator [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC) places strict controls on corporations wishing to use the term "university" and if the applicant does not intend to provide education services the name must not imply a connection with an existing university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byid/pmidbbee068dcf0e6790ca256b590077c9cb "Guidelines for the use of the word 'university' in company names"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305003744/http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byid/pmidbbee068dcf0e6790ca256b590077c9cb |date=March 5, 2012 }}. www.asic.gov.au; Australia Securities and Investments Commission. Retrieved 2010-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Corporations Regulations 2001 lists the 39 academic organisations permitted to use the title "university".

The use of higher education terms (such as "degree") is protected in state legislation, e.g. Higher Education (Qld) Act 2003.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
According to the laws on higher education in Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unze.ba/download/Zakon_o_visokom_obrazovanju_bos.pdf |title=Zakon o Visokom Obrazovanju u Bosni i Hercegovini |publisher=Vijece Ministara BiH |work=Unze.ba |date=June 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the terms "university", "faculty", "academy" and "university of applied sciences" can be used only by accredited educational institutions.  Accreditation is independently assessed by the Agency for Development of Higher Education and Quality Assurance and formally conferred by the Ministry of Education and Science for each [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|canton]], [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|entity]] or [[Brčko District|district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://unsa.ba/s/images/stories/pdf/zakoni/IZMJENE.pdf |title=Skupstina Kantona Zakonodavno-pravna komisija|volume=XV |issue=22 |date=August 2010 |issn=1512-7052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only these institutions are allowed to award academic degrees and diplomas.

Illegal use of academic titles or academic degrees and "non-accredited diplomas" may lead to prosecution, conviction, fines or even imprisonment.

===Canada===
{{See also|Higher education in Canada}}
In Canada all universities and colleges are under the direct supervision of the provincial and territorial governments, and there are no accreditation authorities, so the problem of degree mills is relatively rare. For example, in Ontario the ''Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000'' regulates degree-granting authority. Any institution that wishes to offer a degree or use the term "university" must be authorized to do so under an Act of the Legislature or by the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_00p36_e.htm "Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000 : S.O. 2000, CHAPTER 36 : Schedule"]. Service Ontario e-Laws.&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of recognized Canadian higher education institutions is available on CICIC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cicic.ca/868/Search-the-Directory-of-Educational-Institutions-in-Canada.canada|title=CICIC - Search the Directory of Educational Institutions in Canada|work=cicic.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Most, but not all, universities and colleges in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] are public institutions. The Ministry of Education, which has legal authority to regulate college enrollment and degree awarding, publishes a yearly list of qualified higher-education institutions. Institutions not on the list cannot admit students or award degrees.

Also, no institution may call itself a "university" or "college" without approval by a provincial-level education department. Any institution, public or private, which wishes to name itself after a geographic region larger than a province (e.g. "South China ... University") must go through the Ministry of Education. A new regulation forbids any new university or college from being named "national", "of China" or similar names.

{{as of|2015|May}}, China has 210 diploma mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=中国210所"野鸡大学"曝光 北京上榜最多|url=http://legal.gmw.cn/2015-05/22/content_15748306.htm|newspaper=|publisher=gmw.cn|date=May 22, 2015|accessdate=May 23, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524115003/http://legal.gmw.cn/2015-05/22/content_15748306.htm|archivedate=May 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
Most universities and colleges are public institutions; universities are self-governing, but financed by the state. However, some schools, like [[Tvind]]'s [[Det Nødvendige Seminarium|teacher college]], provide education which is only accredited outside Denmark.

===Finland===
All universities and colleges are public institutions; universities are state institutions or foundations, and vocational universities are municipal organs. There are no private higher educational institutions and no legal mechanism to found or accredit any. Universities are explicitly defined in the Universities Act.&lt;ref name="YlioL"&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2009/20090558 "Yliopistolaki 24.7.2009/558"]. Finlex.

For purposes of professional qualification, the use of foreign degree qualifications is regulated: if the name of a degree can be confused with a Finnish degree that requires more academic credit, the confusion must be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2007/20071093 "Laki ammattipätevyyden tunnustamisesta 30.11.2007/1093"]. Finlex. Retrieved 2010-09-30. (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt; Although diploma mills have not operated in Finland, countermeasures in university admissions have become necessary because of degrees from foreign diploma mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaleva.fi/uutiset/ulkomaat/tutkintotehtailuun-riittaa-kopiokone/285830/|title=Tutkintotehtailuun riittää kopiokone|work=Kaleva.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are no laws against conferring unaccredited degrees or degrees accredited abroad, as long as a Finnish degree or equivalent is not claimed.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], it is a criminal offense to call an institution a ''Universität'' (university) or ''[[Fachhochschule]]'', or to issue academic degrees, without authorization through an act of the respective [[States of Germany|state's]] [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of Education. It is also a misdemeanor to falsely claim a degree in Germany if it is not accredited, see ''[[:de:Missbrauch von Titeln, Berufsbezeichnungen und Abzeichen]]''.

Some corporate training programs in Germany use the English term "corporate university". Such use of the term is tolerated since it is widely understood that such programs are not actual universities. Similarly, ''Fachhochschulen'' frequently use the English term "university of applied science". Neither are permitted to use the German word ''Universität''.

===Greece===
Institutions of higher [[List of universities in Greece|Tertiary education]] ''Ανώτατα Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα (ΑΕΙ)'' (universities and technical universities) and ''Ανώτατα Τεχνολογικά Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα (ΑΤΕΙ)'' (technological educational institutes / universities of applied sciences) in Greece are fully self-managed public entities and are the only institutions that can issue university diplomas. Diplomas issued by foreign educational institutions are validated and assessed by the Hellenic National Academic Recognition and Information Center (Hellenic NARIC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doatap.gr/gr/nomos.php Hellenic National Academic Recognition and Information Center (Hellenic NARIC)], page in Greek.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
It is illegal under Hong Kong laws chapter 320 ''Post Secondary Colleges Ordinance'' section 8 to call an organisation a "university" without approval from the Chief Executive in Council.

Under Hong Kong laws chapter 200 ''Crimes Ordinance'' section 73, anyone who knowingly uses false documents with the intention of inducing somebody to accept them as genuine is liable to 14 years' imprisonment. Section 76 assigns the same penalty for anyone who makes or possesses machines that create such false documents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap200  "Crimes Ordinance Chapter 200"]. Hong Kong Laws Chap 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission (UGC)]] states, in section 22 of the University Grants Commission Act of 1956:
{{quote|"The right of conferring or granting degrees shall be exercised only by a University established or incorporated by or under a Central Act, a Provincial Act or a State Act or an institution deemed to be a University under section 3 or an institution specially empowered by an Act of Parliament to confer or grant degrees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Ireland===
Legitimate higher education qualifications in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] are placed on, or formally aligned, with the National Framework of Qualifications. This framework was established by the [[National Qualifications Authority of Ireland]] in accordance with the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act (1999). It is illegal under the Universities Act (1997) for any body offering higher education services to use the term "university" without the permission of the Minister for Education and Science. It is likewise illegal under the Institutes of Technologies Acts (1992–2006) to use the term "institute of technology" or "regional technology college" without permission.

===Japan===
Under Article 135 of the School Education Act, all universities and [[Daigakkō|post-secondary education institutes]] in Japan require a government-issued licence from the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT). Operating such an institute without a licence from MEXT can result in a fine of ¥100,000 for each offence committed. In addition, the [[National Institution for Academic Degrees and Quality Enhancement of Higher Education]] (NIAD-QE) has the sole authority to accredit all university and post-secondary qualifications in Japan, as per Article 104 of the School Education Act.

The "[[Patent University]]" &lt;small&gt;([[:ja:特許大学|ja:特許大学]])&lt;/small&gt; was an example of a Japanese diploma mill which operated from 1964 until it was shut down in 1980, and which sold fraudulent doctorates for sums ranging between ¥300,000 and ¥5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/pandradra/61657349.html|title=日本　特許大学博士号メダル（昭和44年） - 徽章はバッジにしてピン|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://netsociety.exblog.jp/11048384/|title=特許大学 - ネット闇世界～新・健康本の世界|first=|last=netsociety|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, MEXT revealed that it had discovered 48 people with suspected falsified qualifications who were successfully hired to teach in 43 universities and post-secondary education institutes throughout Japan between 2004 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/houdou/19/12/08010803/001.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324055810/http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/houdou/19/12/08010803/001.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=24 March 2011|title=「真正な学位と紛らわしい呼称等についての大学における状況に係る実態調査」の結果について ［別紙］－文部科学省|date=24 March 2011|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], the Education Act 1996 protects the status of the terms "university", "university college" and "branch campus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2011/Act%20550.pdf |format=PDF |title=§ 71 Education Act 1996 |publisher=Attorney General's Chambers (Malaysia) |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029023543/http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2011/Act%20550.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only institutions with this status may award academic degrees.

The Private Higher Education Institutions act also places restrictions on the creation and operation of any private higher education institution that conducts any course of study or training programme for which a certificate, diploma or degree is awarded.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2012/Act%20555.pdf|format=PDF|title=§ 76 Private Higher Educational Institutions Act 1996|publisher=Attorney General's Chambers (Malaysia)|accessdate=2008-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029023550/http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2012/Act%20555.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, all legitimate higher education qualifications are placed on or formally affiliated with the [[Malaysian Qualifications Framework]] under the provisions of the Malaysian Qualifications Agency Act 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mqa.gov.my/index1.cfm "MQF At A Glance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107000632/http://www.mqa.gov.my/index1.cfm |date=2016-01-07 }}.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, Under the Education Act the official recognition of studies (RVOE) educational programs offered by private institutions may be granted by the federal education authority by state education authorities both. There are also public institutions of higher education, which are mandated to incorporate programs of these institutions according to its own rules.  As of July 10, 2000, the Ministry applied for the granting of RVOE the guidelines established in the "Secretarial Agreement No. 279 establishing the processes and procedures related to the recognition of official validity of studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ses4.sep.gob.mx/dg/dges/rvoe/ |title=Aviso "Programas sin RVOE" |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418090454/http://ses4.sep.gob.mx/dg/dges/rvoe/ |location=Mexico |archivedate=2008-04-18|publisher= Dirección General de Educación Superior Universitaria |date=July 2007|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretariat of Public Education]] (SEP) lists several institutions that are unaccredited in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirvoes.sep.gob.mx/sirvoes/jspAvisosFull.jsp|title=Official recognition of Federal and State Higher Education|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, the [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretariat]] said 22 federal health officials were arrested after their medical and psychology licenses turned out to be fakes from a diploma mill according to the newspaper ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]''. They included the technical director of the National Center for Blood Transfusions and the chief medical officer of the National Commission for Medical Arbitration, which rules on cases of malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Mexican-Secretariat-Fights/125008/|title=Mexican Secretariat Fights Fake Professional Degrees|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands it is illegal for non-accredited, non-recognized institutes to bestow any legally protected academic title. The [[NVAO]] is the only agency allowed to accredit courses. Since the implementation of the [[Bologna process]], Dutch universities have started to bestow the English titles MSc and PhD instead of their Dutch equivalents. These English versions of the title are not protected under Dutch law. A diploma mill may thus bestow someone with a PhD title without violating Dutch law, but the recipient will not be allowed to use the protected titles "doctor" or "dr."

Partnerships with foreign educational institutions are possible.&lt;ref name=ubocht&gt;{{cite web|url=http://napnieuws.nl/2009/01/30/%E2%80%98je-koopt-als-het-ware-je-bachelor%E2%80%99/|title=‘Je koopt als het ware je bachelor’|work=Nieuw Amsterdams Peil|access-date=2011-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330221047/http://napnieuws.nl/2009/01/30/%E2%80%98je-koopt-als-het-ware-je-bachelor%E2%80%99/|archive-date=2012-03-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the "U-bocht construction".&lt;ref name=ubocht/&gt; In this case, the curricula are neither accredited by NVAO nor recognized by the Dutch Department of Education. Graduates receive a foreign diploma issued by the educational institution which has a partnership with a Dutch educational institution. The status of such a diploma depends upon the laws and accreditation system of the country where the diploma is granted.

Diplomas from accredited universities are accepted in the Netherlands since the Bologna protocol. Diploma's from non EU institutions must be screened and validated first before they are accepted for appointments requiring a validated starting level (e.g. entering a health profession).

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Education Act prohibits use of the terms "degree" and "university" by institutions other than the country's eight accredited universities. In 2004 authorities announced their intention to take action against unaccredited schools using the words "degree" and "university," including the University of Newlands, an unaccredited distance-learning provider based in the [[Wellington]] suburb of [[Newlands, New Zealand|Newlands]]. Other unaccredited New Zealand institutions reported to be using the word "university" included the New Zealand University of Golf in Auckland, the online Tawa-Linden and Tauranga Universities of the Third Age, and the Southern University of New Zealand. Newlands owner Rochelle M. Forrester said she would consider removing the word "university" from the name of her institution in order to comply with the law.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, David (August 26, 2004).

===Nigeria===
The National University Commission (NUC) was formed in 1999 to clamp down on diploma mill activity in the country. A concentrated effort by the NUC has resulted in a significant drop in diploma mill activity in Nigeria.&lt;ref name=bccihe&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/soe/cihe/newsletter/ihe_pdf/ihe53.pdf "Clipping the Wings of Degree Mills in Nigeria"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029135645/http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/soe/cihe/newsletter/ihe_pdf/ihe53.pdf |date=October 29, 2008 }} (PDF). Peter Okebukola, The Boston College Center for International Higher Education, [[Boston College]], Fall 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An International Higher Education article states, "Attainment of the Nigerian vision of being one of the top 20 economies by 2020 will be compromised by the injection of such poor-quality graduates into the economy. Herein lies the distaste for and the ''raison d'être'' for the government's clampdown on degree mills."&lt;ref name=bccihe/&gt;

In Nigeria, online degrees from unaccredited institutions are banned and should not be accepted by employers.&lt;ref name=bccihe2&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/soe/cihe/newsletter/ihe_pdf/ihe53.pdf "Degree Mills: The Impact on Students and Society"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029135645/http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/soe/cihe/newsletter/ihe_pdf/ihe53.pdf |date=October 29, 2008 }} (PDF).

===Norway===
Accreditation of universities and other institutions of higher education ("Universitet", "Høyskole(Høgskole)"), is governed by the state institution NOKUT, Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education.  There have been cases where people submitting diplomas from a "Diploma Mill" to this agency for convalidation, have been prosecuted for fraud.

===Pakistan===
The government-established Higher Education Commission (HEC) is responsible for  all matters related to the accreditation of universities in Pakistan. All recognized universities in Pakistan are listed on the HEC website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hec.gov.pk Pakistan Higher Education Commission].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the
[[Axact]] company, based in Karachi, was the subject of a 2015 investigation by the ''New York Times'', which found it was committing fraud in other countries, by granting fake degrees and diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;Declan Walsh.

===Philippines===
Title IV (Crimes Against Public Interest), section V articles 174 and 175 of the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines]] criminalize the falsification of medical certificates, certificates of merit or service and the like.

===Portugal===
In Portugal according to Base Law of Educative System from 1973 [http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/1973/07/17300/13151321.pdf Lei n.º 5/73] ([[:pt:Lei de Bases do Sistema Educativo|Lei de Bases do Sistema Educativo]]) the diploma mill is impossible. To award higher studies degrees, all higher studies institutions require a governmental issued licence provided by the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education]] and published in the Government Journal ([[Diário da República]]) and communicate to the High Studies General Board (Direção Geral do Ensino Superior - DGES) all record of grades and degree awarded by students. Acting otherwise is punishable by law. Previously to 2007, in the process of opening a new institution or new curriculum to be lectured, it was required to provide the degree content by science branch and the list of PhD, MSc and BSc professors that lecture that specific course, thus getting a licence without expiration date, mandatory professors or contents revision date.

The actual wording in Romanian is "universitate acreditată supusă periodic evaluării instituţionale", and Dumitrescu argues that "care se supun" means that an accredited institution can be evaluated "today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow" (and presumably, any time), not that it needs to have been evaluated in the past.&lt;ref name=cantemir/&gt;&lt;ref name=cantemir2/&gt; For the study year 2010-2011, 16 Master's curricula from nine of its faculties are listed as accredited in Order no. 4630/2010 of the Department of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rau.ro/mydocuments/legislatie/om-4630-11aug2010.pdf|title=Ordinul MECTS nr. 4630/2010|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724025031/http://www.rau.ro/mydocuments/legislatie/om-4630-11aug2010.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
Apart from the graduate level diploma mills, in Russia a significant number of leading institutions have "degree mills" within their departments (typically humanities and economics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosvuz.dissernet.org/|title=РОСВУЗ - Российские ВУЗы под лупой диссернета - Vuz|website=rosvuz.dissernet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the civic initiative [[Dissernet]] such institutions are providing the Russian elite (heads of universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosvuz.dissernet.org/collections/110612|title=РОСВУЗ - Российские ВУЗы под лупой диссернета - View Collections|website=rosvuz.dissernet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissernet.org/expertise/tag/gosudarstvennaya-duma/|title=Cообщество "Диссернет"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and government officials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissernet.org/expertise/tag/minister/|title=Cообщество "Диссернет"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with degrees based on plagiarised and falsified Kandidat nauk (Ph.D Candidate) and Doktor nauk (full Ph.D) theses.

===South Korea===
It is illegal to falsely claim a degree in [[South Korea]] if it is not accredited. In  March 2006 prosecutors in [[Seoul]] were reported to have broken up a crime ring selling bogus music diplomas from Russia, which helped many land university jobs and seats in orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World News Quick Take – Bogus diploma ring busted|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2006/03/21/2003298471 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=March 20, 2006 |accessdate=2008-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who falsely used these degrees were criminally charged.

In early 2007, [[Shin Jeong-ah]] (신정아) was criminally charged for forging and misusing a degree from [[Yale University]]. The case had a far-reaching impact as she was a professor at [[Dongguk University]] and also held a position at an art gallery known to have ties with economical and political figures.

===Sri Lanka===
Until 1999 only state universities could grant degrees, but amendments to the Universities Act now allow private institutions to be granted degree-awarding status by the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]].  Universities can also be established by an [[act of parliament]].

===Sweden===
In June 2007, the Swedish Minister for Employment, [[Sven-Otto Littorin]], was discovered to have an MBA degree from [[Fairfax University]]. Though aware that claiming an MBA from this diploma mill would be illegal in many states in the US, Littorin tried to convince the Swedish media and people of the legitimacy of his qualification. He was eventually  forced to remove the reference from his official [[Résumé|CV]], but he remained in office.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:sv:Sven Otto Littorin|article in Swedish Wikipedia]], [http://www.friktion.se/2007/06/17/sven-otto-littorins-akademiska-meriter/#more-84 "entry in Swedish blog Friktion"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622014927/http://www.friktion.se/2007/06/17/sven-otto-littorins-akademiska-meriter/#more-84 |date=June 22, 2007 }}, and article [http://www.thelocal.se/7644/20070619/ "Minister's MBA 'came from degree mill' "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909060122/http://www.thelocal.se/7644/20070619/ |date=2007-09-09 }}, by James Savage, ''The Local'', June 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{See also|List of universities in Switzerland}}

Qualifications, diplomas and titles earned from Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology ([[ETH Zurich]], [[EPFL]]), from cantonal (state-run) [[List of universities in Switzerland|universities]], from private universities recognized by state authorities, and from [[Fachhochschule]]-institutions (Universities of Applied Sciences run or recognized by official authorities, federal and cantonal) are protected. Accreditation is conferred by the Conference of University Rectors of Switzerland (CRUS) and the Swiss Center of Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education (OAQ). Under Swiss law, it is a criminal offense, under [[unfair competition]] legislation, to profit by any unfounded academic or occupational qualifications. The private use of such a title, however, is legal. Thus, one can call oneself an [[LL.M.]], but one must not use the title when competing for clients.

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Bogus colleges in the United Kingdom}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], degrees may only be awarded by institutions that have degree-awarding powers recognised by the UK authorities (the [[UK parliament]], the [[Scottish parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]] or the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]). Some institutions do not have degree-awarding powers but provide complete courses leading to recognised UK degrees that are validated by institutions which have degree-awarding powers. The UK authorities recognise those institutions which have been granted degree-awarding powers by either a [[Royal charter]], an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] or the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. These degree-awarding institutions are known as "recognised bodies." All UK universities and some higher education colleges are "recognised bodies." If an institution is not a "recognised body" or makes degree awards not validated by such a body, it is likely to be a degree mill. It is an offence against section 214 of the [[Education Reform Act 1988]] for any organisation to offer a degree qualification which could be taken to be that of a UK institution unless it is a "recognised body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recognised UK degrees|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recognised-uk-degrees|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UK Border Agency maintains a list of institutions licensed to sponsor migrant students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Register of licensed sponsors: students|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-students|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that overseas students can check that they are attending an appropriate institution, and the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE) maintain a directory of higher education providers regulated in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Register of HE providers|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/register/|website=HEFCE|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Higher Education Degree Datacheck]] (HEDD) is an initiative sponsored by HEFCE which aims to prevent Higher Education fraud in the UK by maintaining a list of UK degree-awarding bodies, including name changes, mergers and antecedents since 1990, and where institutions that are claiming to be universities are known to be bogus, these are also listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HEDD is UK Higher Education’s official service for candidate verification and university authentication|url=https://www.hedd.ac.uk/|website=HEDD|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Education]] lacks direct [[plenary authority]] to regulate schools and, consequently, the quality of an institution's degree. However, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] works to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and unfair business practices including those in the field of education and alerts United States' consumers about diploma mills by delineating some tell-tale signs in its official web page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt149.shtm |title=Diploma Mills: Degrees of Deception |publisher=FTC.gov |date=April 24, 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the terms of the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], as amended, the [[U.S. Secretary of Education]] is required by law to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies that the Secretary determines to be reliable authorities on the quality of education or training provided by the institutions of higher education that they accredit. Some degree mills have taken advantage of the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] and [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]] by representing themselves as [[seminary|seminaries]], since in many jurisdictions religious institutions can legally offer degrees in religious subjects without government regulation.&lt;ref name="kvue.com"&gt;Associated Press, [http://www.kvue.com/news/state/stories/120304ccjrkvuestateseminary.8f53085.html "Texas Supreme Court to review seminary case"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821142218/http://www.kvue.com/news/state/stories/120304ccjrkvuestateseminary.8f53085.html |date=August 21, 2009 }}, December 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[DipScam]] operation in the 1980s led to a decline in diploma mill activity across the United States, the lack of further action by law enforcement, uneven state laws, and the rise of the [[Internet]] have combined to reverse many of the gains made in previous years. In 2005, the [[US Department of Education]] launched its ''Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs'' website&lt;ref&gt;[http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs:]. ''ope.ed.gov''; U.S. Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; to combat the spread of fraudulent degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Education in India''' is provided by the [[public sector]] as well as the [[private sector]], with control and funding coming from three levels: [[Government of India|central]], [[States and Territories of India|state]] and [[local government|local]]. Under various articles of the [[Indian Constitution]], free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children between the ages of 6 and 14. The ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.

[[India]] has made progress in terms of increasing the [[Education in India#Primary education|primary education]] attendance rate and expanding [[Literacy in India|literacy]] to approximately three-quarters of the population in the 7–10 age group, by 2011.&lt;ref name="wbie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org.in/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/INDIAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:21493265~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:295584,00.html|title=Education in India|publisher=World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its [[economic development in India|economic development]].&lt;ref name=Sify&gt;[http://sify.com/finance/fullstory.php?id=14757040 India achieves 27% decline in poverty], ''Press Trust of India'' via ''Sify.com'', 2008-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the progress, especially in [[Education in India#Higher education|higher education]] and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrollment in [[tertiary education|higher education]] has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrollment Ratio of 24% in 2013,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/ |title=Gross enrollment ratio by level of education|publisher=[[UNESCO]] Institute for Statistics|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there still remains a significant distance to catch up with [[tertiary education]] enrollment levels of developed nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.university-analytics.net/#!global-education/vphur|title=Global Education|publisher=University Analytics|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a [[demographic dividend]] from India's comparatively young population.

Indian At the primary and [[Education in India#Secondary education|secondary]] level, India has a large [[Public school (India)|private school system]] complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.&lt;ref name="pvt_enroll"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/education/school/over-a-quarter-of-enrolments-in-rural-india-are-in-private-schools/article5580441.ece|title=Over a quarter of enrollments in rural India are in private schools|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain post-secondary [[Education in India#Technical education|technical schools]] are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market.&lt;ref name=educationmarket&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everonn.com/images/CLSA140308.pdf |title=Indian education: Sector outlook |format=PDF |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural children between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to report enrollment above 96%. Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 23 lakh students over 2002 total enrollment, and a 19% increase in girl's enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Enrolment-in-schools-rises-14-to-23-crore/articleshow/18123554.cms Enrollment in schools rises 14% to 23 crore] The Times of India (22 January 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system.While more than 95 percent of children attend primary school, just 40 percent of Indian adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9-12).
Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2 billion to education in India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of teachers every day.&lt;ref&gt;Sharath Jeevan &amp; James Townsend, [http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/teachers_are_a_solution_to_education_reform_in_india Teachers: A Solution to Education Reform in India] Stanford Social Innovation Review (17 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such schools.&lt;ref&gt;B.P. Khandelwal, [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001398/139804e.pdf Examinations and test systems at school level in India] UNESCO, pages 100-114&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and all other aspects of operation. Hence, the differentiation of government schools and private schools can be misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laxmi.edu.in/|title=Indian Education System: What needs to change?|author=Ramanuj Mukherjee|work=Unlawyered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under [[Reservation in India|affirmative action]] policies for the historically disadvantaged [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes]] and [[Other Backward Classes]]. In universities, colleges, and similar institutions affiliated to the federal government, there is a maximum 50% of reservations applicable to these disadvantaged groups, at the state level it can vary. [[Reservation in India#Reservations in Maharashtra|Maharashtra]] had 73% reservation in 2014, which is the highest percentage of reservations in India.

===Administration===
====Policy====
Education Policy is prepared by the Centre Government and State Governments at national and state levels respectively. [[National Policy on Education|The National Policy on Education (NPE)]], 1986, has provided for environment awareness, science and technology education, and introduction of traditional elements such as [[Yoga]] into the Indian secondary school system.&lt;ref name="I09RA-231"&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 231&lt;/ref&gt; A significant feature of India's secondary school system is the emphasis on inclusion of the disadvantaged sections of the society. Professionals from established institutes are often called to support in vocational training. Another feature of India's secondary school system is its emphasis on profession based vocational training to help students attain skills for finding a vocation of his/her choosing.&lt;ref name="Blackwell94-95"&gt;Blackwell, 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; A significant new feature has been the extension of SSA to secondary education in the form of the [[Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/secedu/Framework_Final_RMSA.pdf Microsoft Word – Framework_Final_RMSA.doc]. (PDF). Retrieved on 21 March 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007135544/http://www.education.nic.in/secedu/Framework_Final_RMSA.pdf |date=7 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Curriculum and School Education Boards====

School boards set the curriculum, conduct board level exams mostly at 10th and 12th level to award the school diplomas. Exams at the remaining levels (also called standard, grade or class, denoting the years of schooling) are conducted by the schools.
* [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]] (NCERT): The NCERT is the apex body located at New Delhi, Capital City of India. It makes the curriculum related matters for school education across India.&lt;ref name="I09RA-233"&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 233&lt;/ref&gt; The NCERT provides support, guidance and technical assistance to a number of schools in India and oversees many aspects of enforcement of education policies.&lt;ref name="I09RA-230-234"&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 230–234&lt;/ref&gt; There are other curriculum bodies governing school education system specially at state level.
* [[Boards of Education in India|State Government Boards of Education]]: Most of the state governments have at least one "State board of secondary school education". However, some states like Andhra Pradesh have more than one. Also the union territories do not have a board. Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep and Puducherry Lakshadweep share the services with a larger state. The boards set curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and the curriculum varies from state to state and has more local appeal with examinations conducted in regional languages in addition to English - often considered less rigorous than central curriculums such as CBSE or ICSE/ISC. Most of these conduct exams at 10th and 12th level, and some even at conduct board level exams at 5th, 6th and 8th level.
* [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE): The CBSE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and conducts examinations at the 10th and 12th standards that are called board exams. Students studying the CBSE Curriculum take the All India Secondary School Examination (AISSE) at the end of grade 10 and All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) at the end of grade 12. Examinations are offered in Hindi and English.
* [[Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations]] (CISCE): CISCE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and conducts three examinations, namely, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE - Class/Grade 10); The Indian School Certificate (ISC - Class/Grade 12) and the Certificate in Vocational Education (CVE - Class/Grade 12). CISCE English level has been compared to UK's A-Levels; this board offers more choices of subjects. CBSE exams at grade 10 and 12 have often been compared with CICSE and ISC examinations. CICSE is generally considered to be more rigorous than the CBSE AISSE (grade 10) but the CBSE AISSCE and ISC examinations are almost on par with each other in most subjects with ISC including a slightly more rigorous English examination than the CBSE 12th grade examination. The CBSE and ISC are recognized internationally and most universities abroad accept the final results of CBSE and ISC exams for admissions purposes and as proof of completion of secondary school.
*[[National Institute of Open Schooling]] (NIOS): The NIOS conducts two examinations, namely, Secondary Examination and Senior Secondary Examination (All India) and also some courses in Vocational Education. National Board of education is run by Government of India's HRD Ministry to provide education in rural areas and challenged groups in open and distance education mode. A pilot project started by CBSE to provide high class affordable education, provides education up to 12th standard. Choice of subjects is highly customisable and equivalent to CBSE. Home-schooled students usually take NIOS or international curriculum examinations as they are ineligible to write CBSE or ISC exams.
* '''Islamic [[Madrasah]]''':  Their boards are controlled by local state governments, or autonomous, or affiliated with [[Darul Uloom Deoband]] or [http://www.nadwatululama.org/ Darul Uloom Nadwtul Ulama].
* '''Autonomous schools''': Such as [[Woodstock School]], [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram|Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education Puducherry]], [[Visva-Bharati University|Patha Bhavan]] and [[Ananda Marga|Ananda Marga Gurukula]].
* [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) and [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIB): These are generally private schools that have dual affiliation with one of the school education board of India as well as affiliated to the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) Programme and/or the [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIB).
* '''International schools''', which offer 10th and 12th standard examinations under the International Baccalaureate, Cambridge Senior Secondary Examination systems or under their home nations school boards (such as run by foreign embassies or the expat communities).
* [[Special education]]: A special Integrated Education for Disabled Children (IEDC) programme was started in 1974 with a focus on primary education.&lt;ref name="I09RA-233"/&gt; but which was converted into Inclusive Education at Secondary Stage&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/secedu/sec_iedc.asp Secondary Education].

====Midday Meal Nutrition Scheme====
The [[Midday Meal Scheme]] is a [[school meal]] programme of the [[Government of India]] designed to improve the [[nutrition]]al status of school-age children nationwide,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://home.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/newsroom/wfp207424.pdf|title = India: A Desk Review of the Mid-Day Meals Programme|date = July 2007|last = Chettiparambil-Rajan|first = Angelique|format = PDF|accessdate = 28 July 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131020230641/http://home.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/newsroom/wfp207424.pdf|archive-date = 20 October 2013|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; by suppling free lunches on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in government, government aided, local body, Education Guarantee Scheme, and alternative innovative education centres, ''[[Madarsa]]'' and ''Maqtabs'' supported under [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]], and National Child Labour Project schools run by the ministry of labour.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdm.nic.in/Files/Right%20to%20information/Frequently_Asked_Questions_on_MDM.pdf |title=Frequently Asked Questions on Mid Day Meal Scheme |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centres, it is the largest such programme in the world.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdm.nic.in/aboutus.html |title=About the Mid Day Meal Scheme |publisher=Mdm.nic.in |date= |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of schooling===
====Pre-Primary education====
[[File:Indian Preschool.jpg|thumbnail|220x220px|right|Indian Pre-Primary School children (Divine Orchids International Preschool, [[Jawhar]])]]
The pre-primary stage is the foundation of children's knowledge, skills and behaviour. On completion of pre-primary education, the children are sent to the primary stage but pre-primary education in India is not a fundamental right. In rural India, pre-primary schools are rarely available in small villages and urban areas on the contrary. But in cities and big towns, there are many established players in the pre-primary education sector. The demand for the preschools is growing considerably in the smaller towns and cities but still only 1% of the population under age 6 is enrolled in preschool education.
* '''Play group (pre-nursery)''': At play schools, children are exposed to a lot of basic learning activities that help them to get independent faster and develop their self-help qualities like eating food themselves, dressing up, and maintaining cleanliness. The age limit for admission into pre-nursery is 2 to 3 years. [[Anganwadi]] is government funded free rural childcare &amp; mothercare nutrition and learning program also incorporating the free [[Midday Meal Scheme]].
* '''Nursery''': Nursery level activities help children unfold their talents, thus enabling them to sharpen their mental and physical abilities. The age limit for admission in nursery is 3 to 4 years. 
* '''LKG''': It is also called the Junior Kindergarten (Jr.&amp;nbsp;kg) stage. The age limit for admission in LKG is 4 to 5 years. 
* '''UKG''': It is also called the Senior Kindergarten (Sr.&amp;nbsp;kg) stage. The age limit for admission in UKG is 5 to 6 years.
LKG and UKG stages prepare and help children emotionally, mentally, socially and physically to grasp knowledge easily in the later stages of school and college life.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/New-minimum-age-rule-for-entry-level-admission-stumps-parents-schools-in-Mumbai/articleshow/45983976.cms] [[Times of India]]&lt;/ref&gt;
A systematic process of preschool education is followed in India to impart knowledge in the best possible way for better understanding of the young children. By following an easy and interesting curriculum, teachers strive hard to make the entire learning process enjoyable for the children.

====Primary education====

The Indian government lays emphasis on primary education, also referred to as elementary education, to children aged 6 to 14 years old.&lt;ref name="Blackwell93-94"&gt;Blackwell, 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; Because education laws are given by the states, duration of primary school visit alters between the Indian states.  The Indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions.&lt;ref name="Blackwell93-94"/&gt; However, both free education and the ban on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions.&lt;ref name="Blackwell93-94"/&gt; 80% of all recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported, making it the largest provider of education in the country.&lt;ref name="dise.in"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dise.in/ar2005.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231235835/http://www.dise.in/ar2005.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 December 2008 |accessdate=8 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to a shortage of resources and lack of political will, this system suffers from massive gaps including high pupil to teacher ratios, shortage of infrastructure and poor levels of teacher training. Figures released by the Indian government in 2011 show that there were 5,816,673 elementary school teachers in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dise.in/Downloads/Publications/Publications%202009-10/Flash%20Statistics%202009-10.pdf flashstatistics2009-10.pdf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2012|March|}} there were 2,127,000 secondary school teachers in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/RPE-2010-11.pdf |title=Report to the People on Education 2010-11 |author=Ministry of Human Resource Development |location=New Delhi |date=March 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417135724/http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/RPE-2010-11.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2012 |accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Education has also been made free&lt;ref name="Blackwell93-94"/&gt; for children for 6 to 14 years of age or up to class VIII under the [[Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act]] 2009.&lt;ref name="education.nic.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.nic.in/Elementary/free%20and%20compulsory.pdf |title=The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act |author=Ministry of Law and Justice (Legislative Department) |date=27 August 2009 |accessdate=8 February 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919172506/http://education.nic.in/Elementary/free%20and%20compulsory.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several efforts to enhance quality made by the government. The District Education Revitalisation Programme (DERP) was launched in 1994 with an aim to universalise primary education in India by reforming and vitalising the existing primary education system.&lt;ref name="I09RA-215"&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 215&lt;/ref&gt; 85% of the DERP was funded by the central government and the remaining 15% was funded by the states.&lt;ref name="I09RA-215"/&gt; The DERP, which had opened 1.6 lakh new schools including 84,000 alternative education schools delivering alternative education to approximately 35 lakh children, was also supported by UNICEF and other international programmes.&lt;ref name="I09RA-215"/&gt; In January 2016, [[Kerala]] became the 1st Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its literacy programme Athulyam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Kerala becomes 1st Indian state to achieve 100% primary education|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/kerala-becomes-1st-indian-state-achieve-100-primary-education-662878|accessdate=14 January 2016|agency=International Business Times|publisher=International Business Times|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This primary education scheme has also not shown a high Gross Enrollment Ratio of 93–95% for the last three years in some states.&lt;ref name="I09RA-215"/&gt; Significant improvement in staffing and enrollment of girls has also been made as a part of this scheme.&lt;ref name="I09RA-215"/&gt; The current scheme for universalisation of Education for All is the [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] which is one of the largest education initiatives in the world. Enrollment has been enhanced, but the levels of quality remain low.

====Secondary education====
[[File:Indian schoolgirls.jpg|thumb|Secondary school girls in [[Delhi]].]]

''See also'': [[Gender inequality in India]]

Secondary education covers children aged 12 to 18, a group comprising 8.85 [[crore]] children according to the [[2001 Census of India]]. The final two years of secondary is often called '''Higher Secondary (HS)''', Senior Secondary, or simply the '''"+2" stage'''. The two halves of secondary education are each an important stage for which a pass certificate is needed, and thus are affiliated by central boards of education under HRD ministry, before one can pursue higher education, including college or professional courses.

UGC, NCERT, CBSE and ICSE directives state qualifying ages for candidates who wish to take board exams. Those at least 15 years old by 30 May for a given academic year are eligible to appear for Secondary board exams, and those 17 by the same date are eligible to appear for Higher Secondary certificate board exams. It further states that upon successful completion of Higher Secondary, one can apply to higher education under UGC control such as Engineering, Medical, and Business Administration.

Secondary education in India is examination-oriented and not course-based: students register for and take classes primarily to prepare for one of the centrally-administered examinations. Senior school or high school is split into 2 parts (grades 9-10 and grades 11-12) with a standardized nationwide examination at the end of grade 10 and grade 12 (usually informally referred to as "board exams"). Grade 10 examination results can be used for admission into grades 11-12 at a secondary school, pre-university program, or a vocational or technical school. Passing a grade 12 board examination leads to the granting of a secondary school completion diploma, which may be used for admission into vocational schools or universities in the country or the world. Most reputable universities in India require students to pass college-administered admissions tests in addition to passing a final secondary school examination for entry into a college or university. School grades are usually not sufficient for college admissions in India.

Most schools in India do not offer subject and scheduling flexibility due to budgeting constraints (for e.g.: most students in India are not allowed to take Chemistry and History in grades 11-12 because they are part of different "streams"). Private candidates (i.e. not studying in a school) are generally not allowed to register for and take board examinations but there are some exceptions such as NIOS.

=====10th (Matriculation or Secondary) Exam =====
Students taking the grade 10 examination usually take six subjects: English, Mathematics, Social Studies, Science, one language, and one optional subject depending on the availability of teachers at different schools. "Elective" or optional subjects often include Computer Applications, Economics, Physical Education, Commerce, and Environmental Science.

=====12th (Senior Secondary or Higher Secondary) Exam =====
Students taking the grade 12 examination usually take four or five subjects with English or the local language being compulsory. Students re-enrolling in most secondary schools after grade 10 have to make the choice of choosing a "core stream" in addition to English or the local language: Science (Mathematics/Biology, Chemistry, and Physics), Commerce (Accounts, Business Studies, and Economics), or Humanities (any three of History, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology, Geography depending on school). Students study Mathematics up to single-variable Calculus in grade 12.

===Types of schools===
====Government schools====
Majority of the students study in the government schools where poor and vulnerable students study for free until the age of 14. A Education Ministry data, 65% (113 million,) of all school students in 20 states go to government schools (c. 2017).&lt;ref name=study1&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/in-5-years-private-schools-gain-17-million-students-government-schools-lose-13-million/story-6FV1ic7RLttmWc0ZkhBQBM.html In 5 years, private schools gain 17 million students, government schools lose 13 million], [[Hindustan Times]], 17 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; These include schools runs by the state and local government as well as the centre government. Example of large centre government run school systems are [[Kendriya Vidyalaya]] in urban areas, [[Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya]], [[Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya]] for the gifted students, [[Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya]] for girls belonging to vulnerable SC/ST/OBC classes, [[Indian Army Public Schools]] run by the [[Indian Army]] for the children of soldiers.

[[Kendriya Vidyalaya]] project, was started for the employees of the central government of India, who are deployed throughout the country. The government started the ''Kendriya Vidyalaya'' project in 1965 to provide uniform education in institutions following the same syllabus at the same pace regardless of the location to which the employee's family has been transferred.&lt;ref name="I09RA-233"/&gt;

====Government aided private schools====
These are usually charitable trust run schools that receive partial funding from the government. Largest system of aided schools is run by [[D.A.V. College Managing Committee]].

====Private schools (unaided)====

According to current estimate, 29% of Indian children are privately educated.&lt;ref name="pvt_enroll"/&gt; With more than 50% children enrolling in private schools in urban areas, the balance has already tilted towards private schooling in cities; and, even in rural areas, nearly 20% of the children in 2004-5 were enrolled in private schools.&lt;ref name="pvt_school"&gt;Desai, Sonalde, Amaresh Dubey, Reeve Vanneman and Rukmini Banerji. 2009.

[[File:GPS-front-view.png|[[Global Public School]], one of the top international schools in South India|220x220px|thumb]]
Most middle-class families send their children to private schools,&lt;ref name="pvt_school"/&gt; which might be in their own city or at distant boarding schools such as [[Rajkumar College, Rajkot]], the oldest private school in India.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} At such schools, the medium of education is often English, but [[Hindi]] and/or the state's official language is also taught as a compulsory subject.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Pre-school education is mostly limited to organised neighbourhood nursery schools with some organised chains.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} [[Montessori education]] is also popular, due to [[Maria Montessori]]'s [[Montessori in India|stay in India during World War II]]. In 2014, four of the top ten pre-schools in [[Chennai]] were Montessori.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/4-Montessori-schools-make-it-to-top-10-list/articleshow/45399648.cms | title=4 Montessori schools make it to top 10 list |author=TNN | date=7 December 2014 | accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many privately owned and managed schools carry the appellation "Public", such as the [[Delhi Public School Society|Delhi Public Schools]], or [[Frank Anthony|Frank Anthony Public Schools]]. These are modelled after [[Public school (United Kingdom)|British public schools]], which are a group of older, expensive and exclusive fee-paying private independent schools in England.

According to some research, private schools often provide superior results at a multiple of the unit cost of government schools. The reason being high aims and better vision.&lt;ref name="creaking"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12749787|title=A special report on India: Creaking, groaning: Infrastructure is India’s biggest handicap|date=11 December 2008|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gprg.org/pubs/workingpapers/pdfs/gprg-wps-071.pdf|title=The progress of school education in India|author=Geeta Gandhi Kingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="varma"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116882502361976702|title=Why India Needs School Vouchers |author=Amit Varma|publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=15 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have suggested that private schools fail to provide education to the poorest families, a selective being only a fifth of the schools and have in the past ignored Court orders for their regulation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In their favour, it has been pointed out that private schools cover the entire curriculum and offer extra-curricular activities such as science fairs, general knowledge, sports, music and drama.&lt;ref name="envision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalenvision.org/library/8/767|title=Private Education in India can Benefit Poor People}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pupil teacher ratios are much better in private schools (1:31 to 1:37 for government schools) and more teachers in private schools are female.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} There is some disagreement over which system has better educated teachers. According to the latest DISE survey, the percentage of untrained teachers (para-teachers) is 54.91% in private, compared to 44.88% in government schools and only 2.32% teachers in unaided schools receive in-service training compared to 43.44% for government schools. The competition in the school market is intense, yet most schools make profit.&lt;ref name="envision"/&gt;
However, the number of private schools in India is still low - the share of private institutions is 7% (with upper primary being 21% secondary 32% - ''source: fortress team research''). Even the poorest often go to private schools despite the fact that government schools are free. A study found that 65% school-children in Hyderabad's slums attend private schools.&lt;ref name="varma"/&gt;

====International schools====
{{as of|2015|January|}}, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/|title=International School Consultancy Group &gt; Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed India as having 410 international schools.&lt;ref name="iscresearch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|title=International School Consultancy Group &gt; Information &gt; ISC News|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms "ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country’s national curriculum and is international in its orientation."&lt;ref name="iscresearch.com"/&gt; This definition is used by publications including [[The Economist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new|title=The new local|date=17 December 2014|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Home-schooling====
[[Homeschooling|Home-schooling]] is [[Legality of Homeschooling#Asia|legal in India]], though it is the less explored option. The Indian Government's stance on the issue is that parents are free to teach their children at home, if they wish to and have the means. The then HRD Minister Kapil Sibal has stated that despite the RTE Act of 2009, if someone decides not to send his/her children to school, the government would not interfere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=TOINEW&amp;BaseHref=TOIPU%2F2010%2F09%2F08&amp;ViewMode=GIF&amp;GZ=T&amp;PageLabel=1&amp;EntityId=Ar00104&amp;AppName=1|title=RTE: Homeschooling too is fine, says Sibal|work=Times of India|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher education==

Student may opt for vocation education or the university education.

===Vocational education===
India's All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) reported, in 2013, that there are more than 4,599 vocational institutions that offer degrees, diploma and post-diploma in architecture, engineering, hotel management, infrastructure, pharmacy, technology, town services and others. There were 17.4 lakh students enrolled in these schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/Growth_Technical_Institutions_310514.pdf#toolbar=0 Growth of Technical Institutes in the Country] AICTE, Govt of India&lt;/ref&gt; Total annual intake capacity for technical diplomas and degrees exceeded 34 lakh in 2012.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

According to the University Grants Commission (UGC) total enrollment in Science, Medicine, Agriculture and Engineering crossed 65 lakh in 2010. The number of women choosing engineering has more than doubled since 2001.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Some institutions of India, such as the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IITs), [[Indian Institute of Science]] and [[National Institutes of Technology]] (NITs) have been globally acclaimed for their standard of under-graduate education in engineering. Several other institutes of fundamental research such as the [[Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science]] (IACS), [[Indian Institute of Science]] (IISc), [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] (TIFR), [[Harish-Chandra Research Institute]] (HRI), [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research]] (IISER) are also acclaimed for their standard of research in basic sciences and mathematics. However, India has failed to produce world class universities both in the private sector or the public sector.&lt;ref name=times&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-17/india/28220501_1_qs-world-university-rankings-three-rankings-academic-ranking India doesn't figure in world top-100 universities], ''Press Trust of India'' via ''timesofindia.com'', 2010-09-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides top rated universities which provide highly competitive world class education to their pupils, India is also home to many universities which have been founded with the sole objective of making easy money. Regulatory authorities like UGC and AICTE have been trying very hard to extirpate the menace of private universities which are running courses without any affiliation or recognition. Indian Government has failed to check on these education shops, which are run by big businessmen &amp; politicians. Many private colleges and universities do not fulfil the required criterion by the Government and central bodies (UGC, AICTE, MCI, BCI etc.) and take students for a ride. For example, many institutions in India continue to run unaccredited courses as there is no legislation strong enough to ensure legal action against them. Quality assurance mechanisms have failed to stop misrepresentations and malpractices in higher education. At the same time regulatory bodies have been accused of corruption, specifically in the case of deemed-universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2614/stories/20090717261400400.htm |title=University Business |publisher=Frontline |date=17 April 2009 |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context of lack of solid quality assurance mechanism, institutions need to step-up and set higher standards of self-regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/eduindia/docs/edu_tech-_vol-2-issue-01-january-2011?mode=embed&amp;layout=http://skin.issuu.com/v/light/layout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true&amp;pageNumber=12 |title=Shouldering the Quality Responsibility |publisher=EDU Magazine |date=January 2011 |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first Five-year Plan onwards, India's emphasis was to develop a pool of scientifically inclined manpower.&lt;ref name="Suri&amp;Rajaram30"&gt;"Infrastructure: S&amp;T Education", ''Science and Technology in India'', 30&lt;/ref&gt; India's National Policy on Education (NPE) provisioned for an apex body for regulation and development of higher technical education, which came into being as the [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE) in 1987 through an act of the Indian parliament.&lt;ref name="Suri&amp;Rajaram31"&gt;"Infrastructure: S&amp;T Education", ''Science and Technology in India'', 31&lt;/ref&gt; At the federal level, the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]], the [[Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology]], the [[National Institutes of Technology]] and the [[Indian Institutes of Information Technology]] are deemed of national importance.&lt;ref name="Suri&amp;Rajaram31"/&gt;

The [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] ([[Indian Institutes of Technology|IITs]]) and [[National Institutes of Technology]] ([[National Institutes of Technology|NITs]]) are among the nation's premier education facilities.&lt;ref name="Suri&amp;Rajaram31"/&gt;[[File:Main(Administrative)Building IIT-Roorkee.JPG|[[Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee|Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee]]|220x220px|thumb]]



&lt;ref name="Suri&amp;Rajaram31"/&gt; The UGC has inter-university centres at a number of locations throughout India to promote common research, e.g. the Nuclear Science Centre at the [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]], [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref name="Suri&amp;Rajaram32"&gt;"Infrastructure: S&amp;T Education", ''Science and Technology in India'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; Besides there are some British established colleges such as Harcourt Butler Technological Institute situated in Kanpur and King George Medical University situated in Lucknow which are important centre of higher education.

Central Universities such as [[Banaras Hindu University]], [[Jamia Millia Islamia]] University, [[Delhi University]], [[Mumbai University]], [[University of Calcutta]], [[Jadavpur University]] etc. too are pioneers of technical education in the country.

In addition to above institutes, efforts towards the enhancement of technical education are supplemented by a number of recognised Professional Engineering Societies such as:
# Institution of Engineers (India)
# Institution of Civil Engineers (India)
# Institution of Mechanical Engineers (India)
# Institution of Chemical Engineering (India)
# Institution of Electronics and Tele-Communication Engineers (India)
# [[Indian Institute of Metals]]
# Institution of Industrial Engineers (India)
# Institute of Town Planners (India)
# [[Indian Institute of Architects]]
that conduct Engineering/Technical Examinations at different levels (Degree and diploma) for working professionals desirous of improving their technical qualifications.

The number of graduates coming out of technical colleges increased to over 7 lakh in 2011 from 5.5 lakh in FY 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nandakumar|first=Indu|title=Number of tech graduates swells; salaries at IT firms stay stagnant|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-11-24/news/30437637_1_engineering-colleges-engineering-and-technology-graduates|work=[[The Economic Times]]|accessdate=19 March 2012|date=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knowledge Professionals|url=http://www.nasscom.org/knowledge-professionals|work=Indian IT-BPO: Trends &amp; Insights|publisher=[[NASSCOM]]|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to one study, 75% of technical graduates and more than 85% of general graduates lack the skills needed in India's most demanding and high-growth global industries such as Information Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anand|first=Geeta|title=India Graduates Millions, but Too Few Are Fit to Hire|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703515504576142092863219826|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=19 March 2012|date=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These high-tech global information technologies companies directly or indirectly employ about 23 lakh people, less than 1% of India's labour pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicte-india.org/ictit.htm Information Technology] AICTE (2012) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707013756/http://www.aicte-india.org/ictit.htm |date=7 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; India offers one of the largest pool of technically skilled graduates in the world.

==Open and distance learning==
At the school level, [[National Institute of Open Schooling]] (NIOS) provides opportunities for continuing education to those who missed completing school education. 14&amp;nbsp;lakh students are enrolled at the secondary and higher secondary level through open and distance learning.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} In 2012 Various state governments also introduced "STATE OPEN SCHOOL" to provide distance education.&lt;ref name="Bihar State open school"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bbose.org | title=Bihar State open school | accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At higher education level, [[Indira Gandhi National Open University]] (IGNOU) co-ordinates distance learning. It has a cumulative enrollment of about 15&amp;nbsp;lakh, serviced through 53 regional centres and 1,400 study centres with 25,000 counselors. The Distance Education Council (DEC), an authority of IGNOU is co-coordinating 13 State Open Universities and 119 institutions of correspondence courses in conventional universities. While distance education institutions have expanded at a very rapid rate, but most of these institutions need an up gradation in their standards and performance. There is a large proliferation of courses covered by distance mode without adequate infrastructure, both human and physical. There is a strong need to correct these imbalances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DATT |first=SUNDHARAM|title=INDIAN ECONOMY|year=2010|publisher=S. CHAND}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literacy===
{{Main|Literacy in India}}
According to the Census of 2011, "every person above the age of 7 years who can read and write with understanding in any language is said to be literate". According to this criterion, the 2011 survey holds the National Literacy Rate to be 74.04%.&lt;ref name="I09RA-225"/&gt; The youth literacy rate, measured within the age group of 15 to 24, is 81.1% (84.4% among males and 74.4% among females),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/DataCentre/Pages/country-profile.aspx?code=IND&amp;regioncode=40535|title=Country Profiles - India|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 86% of boys and 72% of girls are literate in the 10-19 age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=International Institute for Population Sciences &amp; ORC Macro. 2000|publisher=National Family Health Survey (NFHS-2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Indian states, [[Tripura]] has the highest literacy rate of 94.65% whereas [[Bihar]] averaged 61.8% literacy.&lt;ref name="I09RA-225"/&gt; The 2001 statistics indicated that the total number of 'absolute non-literates' in the country was 304 million.&lt;ref name="I09RA-225"/&gt; Gender gap in literacy rate is high, for example in [[Rajasthan]],  the state with the lowest female literacy rate in India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Rajasthan: India's seventh largest state, lowest in female literacy |url=http://wap.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/rajasthan-india-s-seventh-largest-state-lowest-in-female-literacy-117011100734_1.html |publisher=[[Business Standard]] |work=IndiaSpend.com  |author=Khushboo Balani |date=11 January 2017| accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; average female literacy rate is 52.66% and average male literacy rate is 80.51%, making a gender gap of 27.85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/data_files/india/Final_PPT_2011_chapter6.pdf |title=Census 2011, Chapter 6 (State of Literacy) |publisher=[[Government of India]] |accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2011||}}, enrollment rates are 58% for pre-primary, 93% for primary, 69% for secondary, and 25% for tertiary education.&lt;ref name=wdi_enroll&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/2.11|title=World Development Indicators: Participation in education|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the high overall enrollment rate for primary education among rural children of age 10, half could not read at a basic level, over 60% were unable to do division, and half dropped out by the age of 14.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12749787|title=A special report on India: Creaking, groaning: Infrastructure is India’s biggest handicap|work=The Economist|date=11 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, two states in India, [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]], participated in the international [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] exams which is administered once every three years to 15-year-old's. Both states ranked at the bottom of the table, beating out only [[Kyrgyzstan]] in score, and falling 200 points (two standard deviations) below the average for [[OECD]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/indian-schools-dwarfed-in-global-ratings-programme/890091/|title=Indian schools dwarfed in global ratings programme|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the immediate aftermath there was a short-lived controversy over the quality of primary education in India, ultimately India decided to not participate in PISA for 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/India-backs-out-of-global-education-test-for-15-year-olds/articleshow/15332715.cms|title=India backs out of global education test for 15-year-olds|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again not to for 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/India-chickens-out-of-international-students-assessment-programme-again/articleshow/20375670.cms|title=India chickens out of international students assessment programme again|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the quality of free, public education is in crisis, a majority of the urban poor have turned to [[Education in India#Private education|private schools]]. In some urban cities, it is estimated as high as two-thirds of all students attend private institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/world/asia/for-indias-poor-private-schools-help-fill-a-growing-demand.html|title=Many of India’s Poor Turn to Private Schools|work=The New York Times|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which charge a modest US$2 per month.

===Public school workforce===
Officially, the pupil to teacher ratio within the public school system for primary education is 35:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.ENRL.TC.ZS|title=World Bank: Pupil-teacher ratio, primary|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, teacher absenteeism in India is exorbitant, with 25% never showing up for work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/0,,contentMDK:20848416~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:223547,00.html|title=Teachers Skipping Work|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank estimates the cost in salaries alone paid to such teachers who have never attended work is US $2 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/education/hidden-cost-corruption-teacher-absenteeism-and-loss-schools|title=The Hidden Cost of Corruption: Teacher Absenteeism and Loss in Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indian School-Girls at Jodhpur.jpg|thumb|Indian School-Children]]
A study on teachers by Kremer etc. found out that 25% of private sector teachers and 40% of public sector medical workers were absent during the survey. Among teachers who were paid to teach, absence rates ranged from 14.6% in [[Maharashtra]] to 41.9% in [[Jharkhand]]. Only 1 in nearly 3,000 public school head teachers had ever dismissed a teacher for repeated absence.&lt;ref name=Kremer&gt;{{cite web|author=4–6 p.m. |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/macarthur/inequality/papers/KremerTeacherAbsenceinIndia.pdf |title=Kremer etc. (2004), "Teacher Absence in India: A Snapshot", ''Journal of the European Economic Association'' |publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date=30 October 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326211644/http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/macarthur/inequality/papers/KremerTeacherAbsenceinIndia.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study found "only about half were teaching, during unannounced visits to a nationally representative sample of government primary schools in India."&lt;ref name=Kremer/&gt;

===Higher education===
As per Report of the Higher education in India, Issues Related to Expansion, Inclusiveness, Quality and Finance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/pub/index.html |title=12. Report of the HIGHER EDUCATION IN INDIA Issues Related to Expansion, Inclusiveness, Quality and Finance, May 2008 |publisher=Ugc.ac.in |accessdate=1 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822192450/http://www.ugc.ac.in/pub/index.html |archivedate=22 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the access to higher education measured in term of gross enrollment ratio increased from 0.7% in 1950/51 to 1.4% in 1960–61. By 2006/7 the GER increased to about 11%. Notably, by 2012, it had crossed 20% (as mentioned in an earlier section).

===Vocational education===
An optimistic estimate from 2008 was that only one in five job-seekers in India ever had any sort of [[vocational training]].&lt;ref name="elephant"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12749735|title=A special report on India: An elephant, not a tiger|date=11 December 2008|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However it's expected to grow as the CBSE has brought changes in its education system which emphasises inclusion of certain number and types of vocational subjects in classes 9th and 11th. Although it's not mandatory for schools to go for it but a good number of schools have voluntarily accepted the suggestion and incorporated the change in their curriculum. &lt;ref.cbse notifications 2018 &gt;

===Technical certification Education===
Demand for technical certification is increasing every year among job seekers and WEBNext Labs has been imparting free technical education on web technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper= Samagya Hindi Daily| url=http://samagya.in/epaper/edition/313/april/page/4  | date=12 April 2017 | accessdate=April 12, 2017 | title=वेबनेक्सट लैब्स अब युवाओ के भविस्य को बदलने के लिए तैयार | trans-title=Webnext Labs now ready to change the future of youth | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and IoT (Internet of Things) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | accessdate=August 28, 2017 | url=http://samagya.in/news/वेबनेक्सट-लैब्स-webnext-labs-अब-प्रद/ |title=वेबनेक्सट लैब्स में दी जायेगा आईओटी की शिक्षा  | trans-title=Webnext labs will now impart training on IoT | date=August 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum issues===
Modern education in India is often criticised for being based on [[rote learning]] rather than problem solving. ''New Indian Express'' says that Indian Education system seems to be producing zombies since in most of the schools students seemed to be spending majority of their time in preparing for competitive exams rather than learning or playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-education-Creating-zombies-focussed-on-passing-exams/2013/07/31/article1711375.ece |title='Indian Education: creating Zombies focussed on passing exam' |first=Anil K |last=Rajvanshi |work=New Indian Express |date=13 July 2013|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BusinessWeek'' criticises the Indian curriculum, saying it revolves around rote learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_22/b3885015.htm|title=India|publisher=BusinessWeek|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821200623/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_22/b3885015.htm|archivedate=21 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ExpressIndia'' suggests that students are focused on cramming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/-rote-system-of-learning-still-rules-the-roost-/375996/ |title=‘Rote system of learning still rules the roost’ |publisher=ExpressIndia |date=21 October 2008 |accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following independence, India viewed education as an effective tool for bringing social change through community development.&lt;ref name=SettyandRoss120&gt;Setty and Ross, 120&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative control was effectively initiated in the 1950s, when, in 1952, the government grouped villages under a Community Development Block—an authority under national programme which could control education in up to 100 villages.&lt;ref name=SettyandRoss120/&gt; A Block Development Officer oversaw a geographical area of {{convert|150|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} which could contain a population of as many as 70,000 people.&lt;ref name=SettyandRoss120/&gt;

Setty and Ross elaborate on the role of such programmes, themselves divided further into ''individual-based'', ''community based'', or the ''Individual-cum-community-based'', in which microscopic levels of development are overseen at village level by an appointed worker:

{{quotation|The community development programmes comprise agriculture, animal husbandry, cooperation, rural industries, rural engineering (consisting of minor irrigation, roads, buildings), health and sanitation including family welfare, family planning, women welfare, child care and nutrition, education including adult education, social education and literacy, youth welfare and community organisation. In each of these areas of development there are several programmes, schemes and activities which are additive, expanding and tapering off covering the total community, some segments, or specific target populations such as small and marginal farmers, artisans, women and in general people below the poverty line.&lt;ref name=SettyandRoss120/&gt; }}

Despite some setbacks the rural education programmes continued throughout the 1950s, with support from private institutions.&lt;ref name=SettyandRoss121&gt;Setty and Ross, 121&lt;/ref&gt; A sizeable network of rural education had been established by the time the ''Gandhigram Rural Institute'' was established and 5,200 Community Development Blocks were established in India.&lt;ref name=SettyandRoss122&gt;Setty and Ross, 122&lt;/ref&gt; Nursery schools, elementary schools, secondary school, and schools for adult education for women were set up.&lt;ref name=SettyandRoss122/&gt;

The government continued to view rural education as an agenda that could be relatively free from bureaucratic backlog and general stagnation.&lt;ref name=SettyandRoss122/&gt; However, in some cases lack of financing balanced the gains made by rural education institutes of India.&lt;ref name=SettyandRoss125/&gt; Some ideas failed to find acceptability among India's poor and investments made by the government sometimes yielded little results.&lt;ref name=SettyandRoss125&gt;Setty and Ross, 125&lt;/ref&gt; Today, government rural schools remain poorly funded and understaffed. Several foundations, such as the [[Rural Development Foundation]] (Hyderabad), actively build high-quality rural schools, but the number of students served is small.

Education in rural India is valued differently from in an urban setting, with lower rates of completion. An imbalanced [[sex ratio]] exists within schools with 18% of males earning a high school diploma compared with only 10% of females. The estimated number of children who have never attended school in India is near 100 million which reflects the low completion levels.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} This is the largest concentration in the world of youth who haven't enrolled in school.&lt;ref name=Verma&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verma|first1=Suman|last2=Saraswathi|first2=T.S.|title=The World's Youth: Adolescence in Eight Regions of the Globe|date=2002|publisher=The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-00605-8|page=117}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=De&gt;{{cite book|last1=De|first1=Anuradha|last2=Drèze|first2=Jean|title=Public Report on Basic Education in India|date=3 June 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=UK|isbn=0195648706}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1999--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U.N."&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Development Report 1999|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/260/hdr_1999_en_nostats.pdf|website=United Nations|accessdate=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U.N.1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Development Report 2000|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/261/hdr_2000_en.pdf|website=United Nations|accessdate=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of literate women among the female population of India was between 2–6% from the British Raj onwards to the formation of the Republic of India in 1947.&lt;ref name=Raman235&gt;Raman, 235&lt;/ref&gt; Concerted efforts led to improvement from 15.3% in 1961 to 28.5% in 1981.&lt;ref name=Raman235/&gt; By 2001 literacy for women had exceeded 50% of the overall female population, though these statistics were still very low compared to world standards and even male literacy within India.&lt;ref name=Raman236&gt;Raman, 236&lt;/ref&gt; Recently the Indian government has launched''' Saakshar Bharat Mission for Female Literacy'''. This mission aims to bring down female illiteracy by half of its present level.

Sita Anantha Raman outlines the progress of women's education in India:

{{Quotation|Since 1947 the Indian government has tried to provide incentives for girls' school attendance through programmes for midday meals, free books, and uniforms. This welfare thrust raised primary enrollment between 1951 and 1981. In 1986 the National Policy on Education decided to restructure education in tune with the social framework of each state, and with larger national goals. It emphasised that education was necessary for democracy, and central to the improvement of women's condition. The new policy aimed at social change through revised texts, curricula, increased funding for schools, expansion in the numbers of schools, and policy improvements. Emphasis was placed on expanding girls' occupational centres and primary education; secondary and higher education; and rural and urban institutions. The report tried to connect problems like low school attendance with poverty, and the dependence on girls for housework and sibling day care. The National Literacy Mission also worked through female tutors in villages. Although the minimum marriage age is now eighteen for girls, many continue to be married much earlier. Therefore, at the secondary level, female drop-out rates are high.&lt;ref name=Raman238/&gt;}}

Sita Anantha Raman also mentions that while the educated Indian women workforce maintains professionalism, the men outnumber them in most fields and, in some cases, receive higher income for the same positions.&lt;ref name=Raman238&gt;Raman, 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The education of women in India plays a significant role in improving livings standards in the country{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. A higher female literacy rate improves the quality of life both at home and outside the home, by encouraging and promoting education of children, especially female children, and in reducing the infant mortality rate{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Several studies have shown that a lower level of women literacy rates results in higher levels of fertility and infant mortality, poorer nutrition, lower earning potential and the lack of an ability to make decisions within a household.&lt;ref&gt;.

A survey that was conducted in India showed results which support the fact that infant mortality rate was inversely related to female literacy rate and educational level.&lt;ref&gt;Women Education in India, (viewed on 9 March 2011), http://www.slideshare.net/siddharth4mba/women-education-in-india {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724094931/http://www.slideshare.net/siddharth4mba/women-education-in-india |date=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey also suggests a correlation between education and economic growth.

In India, there is a large disparity between female literacy rates in different states.&lt;ref&gt;Literacy Rate and Gender Gap in Sechduled Castes in India, (viewed on 9 March 2011), {{cite web|url=http://www.capabilityapproach.com/pubs/NavjeetKaur.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708114637/http://www.capabilityapproach.com/pubs/NavjeetKaur.pdf |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; State of Kerala has the highest female literacy rate of 91.98% while [[Rajasthan]] has the lowest female literacy rate of 52.66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Rajasthan: India's seventh largest state, lowest in female literacy |url=http://wap.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/rajasthan-india-s-seventh-largest-state-lowest-in-female-literacy-117011100734_1.html |publisher=[[Business Standard]] |work=IndiaSpend.com  |author=Khushboo Balani |date=11 January 2017| accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/data_files/india/Final_PPT_2011_chapter6.pdf |title=Census 2011, Chapter 6 (State of Literacy) |publisher=[[Government of India]] |accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlates to the health levels of states, Kerala has average life expectancy at birth of 74.9 while Rajasthan's average life expectancy at birth is 67.7 years.&lt;ref name="life table"&gt;{{cite web|title=ABRIDGED LIFE TABLES- 2010-14 |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Vital_Statistics/SRS_Life_Table/2.Analysis_2010-14.pdf  |page=5 |publisher=OFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR GENERAL &amp; CENSUS COMMISSIONER, INDIA|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, higher education is defined as the education of an age group between 18 and 24, and is largely funded by the government. Despite women making up 24–50% of higher education enrollment, there is still a gender imbalance within higher education. Only one third of science students and 7% of engineering students, are women. In comparison, however, over half the students studying Education are women.&lt;ref&gt;Saraswathi, T.S. &amp; Verma, Suman.

===Accreditation===
In January 2010, the Government of India decided to withdraw [[Deemed university]] status from as many as 44 institutions. The Government claimed in its affidavit that academic considerations were not being kept in mind by the management of these institutions and that "they were being run as family fiefdoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/01/18232326/44-institutions-to-lose-deemed.html |title=44 institutions to lose deemed university status – Economy and Politics |publisher=livemint.com |date=18 January 2010 |accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009,the University Grant Commission found 39 fake institutions operating in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/22-universities-across-India-fake-UGC/425697/ |title=22 universities across India fake: UGC |publisher=ExpressIndia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012003034/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/22-universities-across-India-fake-UGC/425697/ |archivedate=12 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employer training===
Only 10% of manufacturers in India offer in-service training to their employees, compared with over 90% in China.&lt;ref name="wbstrategy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukibc.com/ukindia2/files/India60.pdf |title=Country Strategy for India (CAS) 2009–2012 |publisher=World Bank |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824103426/http://www.ukibc.com/ukindia2/files/India60.pdf |archivedate=24 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teacher Careers===
In the Indian education system, a teacher's success is loosely defined. It is either based on a student's success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher's skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, both of which are often not an indicator of a good teacher.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/in-school/signpost/recognising-excellence-in-the-teaching-profession/article7680538.ece&lt;/ref&gt; This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, there is a need to identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/framing-success-in-teaching/article7597239.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coaching===
[[File:Old Rajinder Nagar Delhi.jpg|thumb|Old Rajinder Nagar Delhi]]
Increased competition to get seats into reputed colleges has given rise to private coaching institutes in India. They prepare students for not only engineering, medical, MBA, SAT, GRE, banking jobs' entrance tests, but also teach subjects like English for employment in India and abroad.

A 2013 survey by [[ASSOCHAM]] predicted the size of private coaching industry to be $40 billion, or Rs 23.9 lakh million in 2015.&lt;ref name="kalpanapathak&amp;amp;msaraswathy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/panel-proposes-to-unleash-watchdog-on-private-coaching-115120100060_1.html|title=Panel proposes to unleash watchdog on private coaching|author=Kalpana Pathak &amp; M Saraswathy|date=1 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coaching classes are blamed for the neglect of school education by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/management/iit-coaching-centres-play-a-board-game-111102700015_1.html|title=IIT coaching centres play a board game|author=Kalpana Pathak|date=27 October 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption in education===
{{further|Capitation fee}}
Corruption in Indian education system has been eroding the quality of education and has been creating long-term negative consequences for the society. Educational corruption in India is considered as one of the major contributors to domestic black money.&lt;ref&gt;http://ficci.in/spdocument/20548/STUDY-ON-WIDENING-OF-TAX-BASE-AND-TACKLING-BLACK-MONEY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grade inflation===
[[Grade inflation]] has become an issue in Indian secondary education. In [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]], a 95 percent aggregate is 21 times as prevalent today as it was in 2004, and a 90 percent close to nine times as prevalent. In the [[Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations|ISC Board]], a 95 percent is almost twice as prevalent today as it was in 2012.  CBSE called a meeting of all 40 school boards early in 2017 to urge them to discontinue “artificial spiking of marks”. CBSE decided to lead by example and promised not to inflate its results. But although the 2017 results have seen a small correction, the board has clearly not discarded the practice completely. Almost 6.5 percent of mathematics examinees in 2017 scored 95 or more — 10 times higher than in 2004 — and almost 6 percent of physics examinees scored 95 or more, 35 times more than in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Following India's independence a number of rules were formulated for the backward Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes of India, and in 1960 a list identifying 405 Scheduled Castes and 225 Scheduled Tribes was published by the central government.&lt;ref name=Elder227&gt;Elder, 227&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment was made to the list in 1975, which identified 841 Scheduled Castes and 510 Scheduled Tribes.&lt;ref name=Elder227/&gt; The total percentage of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes combined was found to be 22.5% with the Scheduled Castes accounting for 17% and the Scheduled Tribes accounting for the remaining 7.5%.&lt;ref name=Elder227/&gt; Following the report many Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes increasingly referred to themselves as ''[[Dalit]]'', a [[Marathi language]] terminology used by [[BR Ambedkar|B R Ambedkar]] which literally means "oppressed".&lt;ref name=Elder227/&gt;

The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are provided for in many of India's educational programmes.&lt;ref name="I09RA-226-7"&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 226–227&lt;/ref&gt; Special reservations are also provided for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in India, e.g. a reservation of 15% in ''Kendriya Vidyalaya'' for Scheduled Castes and another reservation of 7.5% in ''Kendriya Vidyalaya'' for Scheduled Tribes.&lt;ref name="I09RA-226-7"/&gt; Similar reservations are held by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in many schemes and educational facilities in India.&lt;ref name="I09RA-226-7"/&gt; The remote and far-flung regions of North-East India are provided for under the Non-Lapsible Central pool of Resources (NLCPR) since 1998–1999.&lt;ref name="I09RA-236-37"&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 236–237&lt;/ref&gt; The NLCPR aims to provide funds for infrastructure development in these remote areas.&lt;ref name="I09RA-236-37"/&gt;

Women from remote, underdeveloped areas or from weaker social groups in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Assam]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], [[Gujarat]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], and [[Uttarakhand]], fall under the ''Mahila Samakhya Scheme'', initiated in 1989.&lt;ref name="I09RA-216"&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 216&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from provisions for education this programme also aims to raise awareness by holding meetings and seminars at rural levels.&lt;ref name="I09RA-216"/&gt; The government allowed {{INRConvert|34|c}} during 2007–08 to carry out this scheme over 83 districts including more than 21,000 villages.&lt;ref name="I09RA-216"/&gt;

Currently there are 68 ''Bal Bhavans'' and 10 ''Bal Kendra'' affiliated to the ''National Bal Bhavan''.&lt;ref name="I09RA-218"&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 218&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme involves educational and social activities and recognising children with a marked talent for a particular educational stream.&lt;ref name="I09RA-218"/&gt; A number of programmes and activities are held under this scheme, which also involves cultural exchanges and participation in several international forums.&lt;ref name="I09RA-218"/&gt;

India's minorities, especially the ones considered 'educationally backward' by the government, are provided for in the 1992 amendment of the Indian National Policy on Education (NPE).&lt;ref name="I09RA-239"/&gt; The government initiated the Scheme of Area Intensive Programme for Educationally Backward Minorities and Scheme of Financial Assistance or Modernisation of Madarsa Education as part of its revised Programme of Action (1992).&lt;ref name="I09RA-239"/&gt; Both these schemes were started nationwide by 1994.&lt;ref name="I09RA-239"/&gt; In 2004 the Indian parliament passed an act which enabled minority education establishments to seek university affiliations if they passed the required norms.&lt;ref name="I09RA-239"&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative framework===
Article 45, of the [[Constitution of India]] originally stated:
{{quotation|The State shall endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years from the commencement of this Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years.&lt;ref name=SripatiandThiruvengadam150&gt;Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 150&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This article was a [[Directive Principles in India|directive principle of state policy]] within India, effectively meaning that it was within a set of rules that were meant to be followed in spirit and the government could not be held to court if the actual letter was not followed.&lt;ref name="SripatiandThiruvengadam149-150"&gt;Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 149–50&lt;/ref&gt; However, the enforcement of this directive principle became a matter of debate since this principle held obvious emotive and practical value, and was legally the only directive principle within the Indian constitution to have a time limit.&lt;ref name="SripatiandThiruvengadam149-150"/&gt;

Following initiatives by the [[Supreme Court of India]] during the 1990s the 93rd amendment bill suggested three separate amendments to the Indian constitution:&lt;ref name="SripatiandThiruvengadam152-154"&gt;Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 152–154&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution of India was amended to include a new article, 21A, which read:
{{quotation|The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in a such manner as the State may, by law, determine.&lt;ref name=SripatiandThiruvengadam154/&gt;}}

Article 45 was proposed to be substituted by the article which read:
{{quotation|Provision for early childhood care and education to children below the age of six years: The State shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they complete the age of sixteen years.&lt;ref name=SripatiandThiruvengadam154&gt;Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 154&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another article, 51A, was to additionally have the clause:
{{quotation|...a parent or guardian [shall] provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, [a] ward between the age of six to fourteen years.&lt;ref name=SripatiandThiruvengadam154/&gt;}}

The bill was passed unanimously in the ''[[Lok Sabha]]'', the lower house of the [[Parliament of India|Indian parliament]], on 28 November 2001.&lt;ref name=SripatiandThiruvengadam156&gt;Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 156&lt;/ref&gt; It was later passed by the upper house—the ''[[Rajya Sabha]]''—on 14 May 2002.&lt;ref name=SripatiandThiruvengadam156/&gt; After being signed by the [[President of India]] the Indian constitution was amended formally for the eighty sixth time and the bill came into effect.&lt;ref name=SripatiandThiruvengadam156/&gt; Since then those between the age of 6–14 have a ''fundamental right'' to education.&lt;ref name=SripatiandThiruvengadam149&gt;Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 46 of the Constitution of India holds that:
{{quotation|The State shall promote, with special care, the education and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and in particular of the [[Scheduled Castes]] and [[Scheduled Tribes]], and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of social exploitation'.&lt;ref name="I09RA-225"/&gt;}}

Other provisions for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes can be found in Articles 330, 332, 335, 338–342.&lt;ref name="I09RA-225"&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 225&lt;/ref&gt; Both the 5th and the 6th Schedules of the Constitution also make special provisions for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.&lt;ref name="I09RA-225"/&gt;

As a part of the tenth [[Five-year plans of India|Five-year Plan]] (2002–2007), the central government of India outlined an expenditure of 65.6% of its total education budget of {{INRConvert|43800|c}} i.e. {{INRConvert|28800|c}} on elementary education; 9.9% i.e. {{INRConvert|4325|c}} on secondary education; 2.9% i.e. {{INRConvert|1250|c}} on adult education; 9.5% i.e. {{INRConvert|4176.5|c}} on higher education; 10.7% i.e. {{INRConvert|4700|c}} on technical education; and the remaining 1.4% i.e. {{INRConvert|623.5|c}} on miscellaneous education schemes.&lt;ref name="I09RA-223"&gt;''India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition)'', 223&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Financial Year 2011-12, the Central Government of India has allocated {{Indian Rupee}} 38,957&amp;nbsp;crore for the Department of School Education and Literacy which is the main department dealing with primary education in India. Within this allocation, major share of {{Indian Rupee}} 21,000&amp;nbsp;crore, is for the flagship programme 'Sarva Siksha Abhiyan'. However, budgetary allocation of {{Indian Rupee}} 210,000 million is considered very low in view of the officially appointed Anil Bordia Committee recommendation of {{Indian Rupee}} 35,659&amp;nbsp;crore for the year 2011-12. This higher allocation was required to implement the recent legislation 'Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. In recent times, several major announcements were made for developing the poor state of affairs in education sector in India, the most notable ones being the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The announcements are;
(a) To progressively increase expenditure on education to around 6% of GDP.
(b) To support this increase in expenditure on education, and to increase the quality of education, there would be an imposition of an education cess over all central government taxes.
(c) To ensure that no one is denied of education due to economic backwardness and poverty.
(d) To make right to education a fundamental right for all children in the age group 6–14 years.
(e) To universalise education through its flagship programmes such as [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] and [[Midday Meal Scheme]]

However, even after five years of implementation of NCMP, not much progress has been seen on this front. Although the country targeted towards devoting 6% share of the GDP towards the educational sector, the performance has definitely fallen short of expectations. Expenditure on education has steadily risen from 0.64% of GDP in 1951–52 to 2.31% in 1970–71 and thereafter reached the peak of 4.26% in 2000–01. However, it declined to 3.49% in 2004–05. There is a definite need to step-up again. As a proportion of total government expenditure, it has declined from around 11.1% in 2000–2001 to around 9.98% during UPA rule, even though ideally it should be around 20% of the total budget. A policy brief issued by [Network for Social Accountability (NSA)]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nsa.org.in |title=Network for Social Accountability |publisher=NSA |date=28 December 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623134041/http://www.nsa.org.in/ |archive-date=23 June 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; titled "[NSA Response to Education Sector Interventions in Union Budget: UPA Rule and the Education Sector]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nsa.org.in/Policybrief/2009/345NSARUBEDU1.htm |title=345 NSA Response to Education Sector Interventions in Union Budget-UPA Rule and the Education Sector by Siba Sankar Mohanty |publisher=Nsa.org.in |date=21 February 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; " provides significant revelation to this fact.

==History==
{{main|History of education in South Asia}}

[[File:Nalanda Univercity.JPG|220x220px|thumb|The remnants of the library of [[Nalanda]], built in the 5th century BCE by [[Gupta Empire|Gupta kings]]. It was rebuilt twice after invasion, first after an invasion from the [[Huns]] in the 5th century BCE and then after an invasion from the [[Gauda Kingdom|Gaudas]] in the 7th century CE but abandoned after the third invasion by [[Bakhtiyar Khilji#Conquests|Turkic invaders]] in the 12th century.]]

[[Takshasila]] (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of higher learning in India from possibly 8th Century BCE,  and it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila,&lt;!-- [9][10][11] -where?--&gt; in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. [[Nalanda]] was the oldest university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in Ariano -[[páli Language]].&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/opinion/09garten.html |title=Really Old School |last=Garten |first=Jeffrey E. |authorlink=Jeffrey Garten |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centres of learning were [[Nalanda]] (in modern-day [[Bihar]]) and [[Manassa]] in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as [[Buddhist Páli literature]], logic, [[páli grammar]], etc. [[Chanakya]], a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of [[Mauryan Empire]].

Sammanas and Brahmin gurus historically offered education by means of donations, rather than charging fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas, temples also became centres of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught. Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. The priest class, the ''[[Sammana]]s'', were imparted knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the ''[[Kshatriya]]'', were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the ''[[Vaishya]]'', were taught their trade and the working class of the ''[[Shudra]]s'' was generally deprived of educational advantages.

"'''Focus Phrase'''" is a term traditionally used in cognitive-therapy and awareness-management discussions, and now in more general use to describe elicitor statements that evoke a desired refocusing of attention. Psychologically related terms are ''elicitor phrase'' or ''statement of intent''.

The psychological term "Focus Phrase" is now used by therapists and life coaches as a general term.

==Definition==

"Focus phrase" is defined as "a specially-constructed short sentence or phrase that states a person's inner intent to refocus his or her attention immediately in a new pre-ordained direction".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Based both on new research in [[cognitive science]] and on [[cognitive-shifting]] studies of ancient [[meditation]] techniques (see [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]]), focus phrases have been used as a meditative tool and therapy aid, and are being introduced as at-work attentive boosts. They are carefully designed by professionals to almost instantly redirect the mind's attention specifically toward worthwhile sensations, thoughts, images, and other mental experiences. Focus phrases are highly effective in evoking rapid shifts in mental content, quality of awareness, sensory perception, and general inner experience. Therefore, they are considered of high value in meditative methods, and even in creativity-boost techniques.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Traditional cognitive therapy usage==

As explained by the founder of cognitive therapy, [[Aaron Beck]], our chronic thoughtflows (stream of consciousness) tend to dominate our inner experience and stimulate our behavior and emotions. If we want to change our inner experience (for instance from a negative mood to a more positive mood) we need to take charge of the thoughts we are holding in our minds, and state our intent to shift into a preferable mood or quality of consciousness. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The theory of [[cognitive therapy]] teaches that the power of the spoken word in stating one's intent is primary for manifestation of one's intent. In ancient times, the [[Creation myth]] found in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] of the [[Old Testament]] relates that "God said let there be light, and there was light." Perhaps "Let there be light" was the primary focus phrase for our universe. And throughout [[anthropology]] studies, a verbal statement of intent (a blessing; a curse) was considered a decisive act in manifesting that intent.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Business applications==

In corporate awareness-training, focus phrases are used not to change the outer world, but to rapidly shift inner attention, and thus alter personal experience and behavior. For instance, in order to shift rapidly from being lost in thought to present-moment alertness, the following core focus phrase drawn both from [[perceptual]] psychology and ancient [[Yoga]] meditative tradition is used: "I feel the air flowing in and out of my nose." Immediately, as often explained by spiritual teacher [[Alan Watts]] in his numerous books, the words have the psychological power to turn your attention toward the actual breathing experience - which in turn awakens your awareness to sensory experience in the present moment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Elicitor statements using this general 'focus phrase technology' for mental refocusing can be used to redirect attention toward a more positive mood ("I let go of my worries, and feel peaceful inside"), toward more creative states of mind ("I am open to receive insight into my dilemma"), toward interpersonal relating ("I accept this person just as they are"), or toward any other intent to improve one's experience and behavior.

The term Focus Phrase is recently becoming a more general-usage term found in daily communication, referring to any short sentence intended to help a person's performance or inner experience.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} There is also some negative discussion of the term. In the opposite direction, the term Focus Phrase has been studied academically as a part of a Semantics dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~pdekker/Only/Statements/Bende-Farkas.txt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925030141/http://staff.science.uva.nl/~pdekker/Only/Statements/Bende-Farkas.txt |date=September 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Governance in higher education''' is the means by which institutions for [[higher education]] (tertiary or post-secondary education) are formally organized and managed (though often there is a distinction between definitions of [[management]] and [[governance]]). Simply, [[university]] governance is the way in which universities are operated.  Governing structures for higher education are highly differentiated throughout the world, but the different models nonetheless share a common heritage.{{sfn|Altbach|2005|pp=16-18}}{{sfn|Coaldrake et al.|2003|p=5}} Internationally, [[tertiary education]] includes private not-for-profit, private for-profit, and public institutions governed by differentiated structures of management.

Governance and management of post-secondary institutions becomes even more diverse with the differences in defining the relationships between higher and tertiary education (university education), postsecondary education, technical and [[vocational education]], and [[community college]] models of education.  The issues are complicated by current debates over [[collegial]] and shared forms of governance contrasted to [[corporate]] and [[business]] forms of institutional governance.

==Governance==

[[File:Lincoln University NZ.jpg|thumb|right|The library of [[Lincoln University, New Zealand]]]]
The concept of [[governance]] in postsecondary education predominantly refers to the internal structure, organization and management of autonomous institutions.  The internal governance organization typically consists of a governing board ([[board of regents]], board of directors), the [[university president]] (executive head, CEO) with a team of administrative [[chancellors]] and staff, faculty senates, academic deans, department chairs, and usually some form of organization for [[student]] representation.  In the United States, state institution governing boards often emphasize the concept of [[citizen]] governance in recognizing that board members serve a [[civic engagement|civic]] role for the institution.  Management structures themselves have become increasingly complex due to the increasing complexity of intraorganizational, interorganizational and governmental relationships.  Whether college and university education, adult education, technical or vocational education, educational administration presents complex challenges at all levels of private and public education.

"Governance" is defined by Kezar and Eckel as the macro-level of policy decision making.{{sfn|Kezar and Eckel|2004|pp=371-398}}  Kezar and Eckel suggest governance is a multi-level concept including several different bodies and processes with different decision-making functions.  In this way, governance is sometimes defined at difference to the internal management of institutions.  Throughout the world, many [[Central government|national]], [[State (administrative division)|state]] and [[Local government|local]] governments have begun to establish coordinating and governing boards as both [[wikt:buffer|buffer]] and bridge to coordinate governance and institutional management.

[[Image:Gkvk.jpg|thumb|left|Administrative building at [[University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore]]]]
Due to the influences of public sector reforms, several authors (Kezar and Eckel 2004; Lapworth 2004; Middlehurst 2004) point out that next to the concept of shared and participative governance a new form of governance has emerged. According to Lapworth, the rise of the notion of corporate governance and the decline of the shared or consensual governance can be seen to be a result of the decline in academic participation, a growing tendency towards [[managerialism]] and the new environment where the universities are operating.{{sfn|Lapworth|2004|pp=299-314}}

University governance varies between countries. McMaster notes the different cultures in universities and the traditional relationships between faculty and administration, characterizing historical transitions and suggesting that universities today are undergoing transitions in culture.{{sfn|McMaster|2007|pp=1-9}}  Kezar and Eckel point out the substance of governance has changed during the last decades with more emphasis put on high stake issues and more incremental decisions made in a less [[collegial]] mode – the reasons for this stem from trends that have devalued the notion of [[participation (decision making)|participation]] and also from the external pressures for more [[accountability]] and demands for quicker decision-making (that sometimes is achieved through [[bureaucracy]]).{{sfn|Kezar and Eckel|2004|pp=371-398}}  McMaster discusses the same changes in university management resulting from the “huge amount of additional administrative work at all levels within the university, and the requirement for a wide range of specialist skills in areas such as marketing, HR management, management accounting, web development and [[instructional design]]” and the difficulties with the tensions that have resulted between collegial and corporate models of management.{{sfn|McMaster|2007|pp=1-9}}

Dearlove emphasises that, under the conditions of mass higher education, no university can avoid the need for some sort of bureaucratic management and organisation, though this does not mean that the importance of informal discipline and profession-based authority (internal governance of universities) can totally be ignored.{{sfn|Dearlove|1997|pp=56-75}}  Lapworth advocates what the author believes is a model of university governance with the positive aspects of corporate and collegial approaches.{{sfn|Lapworth|2004|pp=299-314}}  The issues in university governance discussed by these literatures are detailed by Coaldrake, Stedman, and Little (2003) through a comparative study of current trends in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, with poignant insight into the different models of governance for the management of higher education. Critical of the currents of change toward “corporate governance,” the authors cite reference to literature that calls for “re-balancing” of university governance, maintaining that the re-balancing “would amount to a clarification of shared governance”.{{sfn|Coaldrake et al.|2003|p=14}}  With changing roles in human resources and the external pressures for accountability affecting university relationships internally, McMaster provides insights by defining management styles in terms of nested partnership between faculty and administration, contiguous partnership, and segmented partnership.  With debates over the recent trends, university organizations, governing associations, and numerous postsecondary institutions themselves have set forth policy statements on governance.{{sfn|McMaster|2007|pp=1-9}}

==United States==
Within the US, governance varies greatly from university to university. Without any policy, various statements have been influential.

The [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP) was the first organization to formulate a statement on the governance of higher education based on principles of democratic values and participation (which, in this sense, correlates with the [[Yale Report of 1828]], which has been referred to as the “first attempt at a formally stated [[philosophy of education]]” for universities, emphasizing at that time that [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] curricula following the establishment of democratic constitutional governance should not be replaced with retrogression to religious curricula).{{sfn|Brubacher|1982|p=5}} The AAUP published its first "Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities" in 1920, “emphasizing the importance of faculty involvement in personnel decisions, selection of administrators, preparation of the budget, and determination of educational policies.  Refinements to the statement were introduced in subsequent years, culminating in the 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities.{{sfn|AAAUP|1966}}  The document does not provide for a “blueprint” for the governance of higher education. Nor was the purpose of the statement to provide principles for relations with industry and government (though it establishes direction on “the correction of existing weaknesses”).  Rather, it aimed to establish a shared vision for the internal governance of institutions.  Student involvement is not addressed in detail.  The statement concerns general education policy and internal operations with an overview of the formal structures for organization and management.  In process and structure, the meaning with the end result is an organizational philosophy for shared governance in higher education.

===National Education Association===
First published in 1987, the [[National Education Association]] (NEA) statement on faculty governance in higher education is a straightforward point of view on their policy in support of shared governance.  The policy maintains that [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] involvement in governance is critical.  Providing research support, the organization states faculty should advise [[Academic administration|administration]] in developing [[curriculum]] and methods of instruction.  Faculty is responsible for establishing degree requirements, takes primary responsibility in [[tenure]] appointments and the award of promotion and [[sabbatical]].  Addressing issues through [[collective bargaining]], the statement believes “administration and the governing boards of colleges and universities should accept the faculty's recommendations”.{{sfn|NEA|1987}}  The statement also maintains that faculty should be involved in salary decisions, evaluating administrators, and budgeting.  The policy concludes with the assertion:
&lt;blockquote&gt; State and federal government and external agencies should refrain from intervening in the internal governance of institutions of higher education when they are functioning in accordance with state and federal law. Government should recognize that conserving the autonomy of these institutions is essential to protecting academic freedom, the advance of knowledge, and the pursuit of truth.{{sfn|NEA|1987}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The policy statement references the AAUP's "1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities."  The basic principles evidently draw from the early AAUP statement on governance.  Though the NEA makes no mention of students anywhere in the policy, the NEA like the AAUP does reflect the basic ideas and premise for the “responsibility primarily of the faculty to determine the appropriate curriculum and procedures of student instruction”.{{sfn|AAUP|1966}}  In this respect, the AAUP grants that considerations should be made for publicly supported institutions.  Unlike the NEA, the AAUP elaborates more on the role of governing structures, including the role of the president to ensure "sound academic practices", as the NEA suggests faculty rights to appeal flawed and improper procedures. In summation, where the AAUP discusses the [[organizational structure]] for governance and management in more detail while touching on student involvement, the NEA statement differs by detailing primarily faculty rights and responsibilities in shared governance.

===Statement of community college governance===
Following on the 1987 publication of "Policy Statement on Higher Education Faculty Governance", in 1989 the NEA issued a "Policy Statement on Higher Education Policy for Community College Governance."  The NEA elaborates upon issues in support of shared governance for the management of community colleges, junior and technical colleges not addressed in their previous statement.  The statement is based on the same principles, believing cooperative decision-making and collective bargaining in governance should be based on “collegial” relationships.  Where statements from the NEA and the AAUP advocate the importance of faculty involvement in governance, the [[community college]] statement notes that many do not exercise the right when available and that faculty “at public institutions are not yet permitted to bargain collectively in many states”.{{sfn|NEA|1989}}  The NEA then elaborates upon the need for faculty participation.

Again, the "Policy Statement of Community College Governance" correlates based upon the same underlying principles of the AAUP and NEA statement on faculty governance.  The community college statement also elaborates upon structure and procedure not addressed in the previous statement, including the “ad hoc” and standing committees as discussed in the AAUP policy statement on governance.  Where the AAUP statement discusses policy on students and their academic rights, with the community college statement the NEA does not address student involvement.{{sfn|NEA|1989}}

===American Federation of Teachers===
In 2002, the Higher Education Program and Policy Council of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT) published a statement in support of the shared governance of institutions.  The policy statement is a response to the fact that many governing boards have adopted the "mantra of business”.{{sfn|AFT|2002}}  The AFT iterates the purpose by which higher education achieves democratic organizational processes between administration and faculty, believing shared governance is under attack in six ways:{{sfn|AFT|2002|p=5}}
# the outsourcing of instruction, particularly to learning technologies;
# redirecting teaching to part-time and temporary faculty;
# re-orienting curriculum to business oriented coursework;
# the buying and selling of courseware for commercial exploitation;
# for profit teaching and research;
# with the formation of a “commercial consortia with other universities and private investors."  Meaning, as many have begun to view education as business, they are not necessarily in the business of education.

Accordingly, six principles affirm standards of [[academic freedom]], faculty participation in standards and curriculum, and faculty decisions on academic personnel as the AAUP first established principles of governance.  The statement maintains that participation in shared governance should be extended, acknowledging that the way in which participation is expanded will vary from institution to institution; “but each group whose work contributes to the academic enterprise should be involved in a manner appropriate to institutional functions and responsibility”.{{sfn|AFT|2002|p=8}}  The policy addresses unions and faculty senates, believing that they contribute to the maintenance of shared governance in institutions as well as the role of accrediting agencies to support management standards.  In conclusion, the AFT emphasizes affirmation of the goals, objectives and purpose for shared governance in higher education.

===Association of Governing Boards===
With recent debates and trends in the governance of institutions of higher education in the United States, the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (AGB) issued a statement on governance, most recently updated in 2010.  The original statement was published with a correlating statement, “Governing in the Public Trust:  External Influences on Colleges and Universities.”  In the first statement on governance, the advisiory organization for institutional governance discusses facts and perceptions concerning governance, including specific facts related to institutional trends and perceptions that “internal governance arrangements have become so cumbersome that timely decisions are difficult to make”.{{sfn|AGB|2001|p=3}}  The AGB statement then defines general principles upon which governing boards are to operate and the responsibilities of a governing board to the institution; the updated principles as of 2010 are below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=AGB |title=Statement on Board Responsibility for Institutional Governance |url=http://agb.org/news/2010-03/statement-board-responsibility-institutional-governance |publisher=AGB|accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The ultimate responsibility for governance of the institution (or system) rests in its governing board.
# The board should establish effective ways to govern while respecting the culture of decision making in the academy.
# The board should approve a budget and establish guidelines for resource allocation using a process that reflects strategic priorities.
# Boards should ensure open communication with campus constituencies.
# The governing board should manifest a commitment to accountability and transparency and should exemplify the behavior it expects of other participants in the governance process.
# Governing boards have the ultimate responsibility to appoint and assess the performance of the president.
# System governing boards should clarify the authority and responsibilities of the system head, campus heads, and any institutional quasi-governing or advisory boards.
# Boards of both public and independent colleges and universities should play an important role in relating their institutions to the communities they serve.

With their statement on governing bodies, the AGB then provides statement on governing in the [[public trust]], iterating many of the same points concerning recent external pressures.  The statement defines the historic role and rationale behind the principles of [[citizen]] governance upon which state institutional boards operate.  Again, addressing the nature of external influences in university governance, the AGB defines specific principles in maintaining accountability and autonomy in the public trust, including
# the primacy of the board over individual members;
# the importance of institutional [[mission statement|mission]]s;
# respecting the board as both [[wikt:buffer|buffer]] and bridge;
# exhibiting exemplary public behaviour; and
# keeping [[academic freedom]] central.{{sfn|AGB|2001|pp=23-26}}

In conclusion, the statement asks for the reaffirmation of a commitment to citizen governance to maintain the balanced and independent governance of institutions.

===2001 Kaplan Survey on higher education governance===
[[Image:Mizzou MemorialUnion.jpg|thumb|right|Tower of Memorial Union at [[University of Missouri]]]]

Sponsored by the AAUP and the American Conference of Academic Deans, the 2001 Survey of Higher Education Governance is a study done by Gabriel Kaplan, a doctoral student at Harvard University interested in replicating research done by Committee T of the AAUP thirty years previously.  The findings of the report detail the method with summary of the present state of shared governance. The findings include the state of the locus of authority and reforms as well as the analysis of the challenges facing Liberal Arts Colleges with the pressures of the current economic climate.{{sfn|Kaplan|2001}}  The preliminary results contain the raw data on the landscape of governance in higher education from a population of 1303 4-year institutions in the United States, with data compiled from both administrative structures and the faculty.  The survey did not include participation from any population of students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/449D4003-EB51-4B8D-9829-0427751FEFE4/0/01Results.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared governance and Jesuit Catholic universities===
[[File:Dartmouth Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Dartmouth College]], 1834]]
Since the 1819 U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'' before the [[Yale Report of 1828]] (where the former was catalyst from the later, each of which upheld the [[separation of church and state]]) private universities in the United States generally maintain remarkable autonomy from local, state, and federal government.  Questions might be raised over the role of shared governance in [[private education]].  In ''Conversations on Jesuit Higher Education'', Quinn and Moore (2005) support values of shared governance in Jesuit Universities.  Quinn notes the way in which [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] colleges and universities adopted principles of shared governance throughout the 1960s.{{sfn|Quinn|2005|pp=30-31}}  Moore begins by noting that the concept of shared governance is often viewed as inefficient in the [[corporate]] world.{{sfn|Moore|2005|pp=26-28}} The author believes that shared governance is not a cumbersome [[system]] of [[management]], but necessary given the organizational dynamics and complexities of university systems.

By contrast to corporate trends, the author maintains that the corporate “one-size-fits-all” system could not effectively suit institutional needs.  From which, the perspective then affirms the AAUP tradition of shared governance as a sound system of organization and management in higher education, “essential to the long term interests of colleges and universities if they wish to remain competitive and academically credible”.{{sfn|Moore|2005|pp=26-28}}  The way in which shared governance is realized in Catholic colleges and universities does vary from institution to institution.  In [[Jesuit]] institutions, when serving the role of a board member an individual of the formal order provides guidance on the philosophy of Jesuit education while facilitating “the mutuality so essential for shared governance before the law and in reality,”{{sfn|Quinn|2005|pp=30-31}} respecting Catholic traditions with a democratic spirit of institutional governance.

==Australia==
In October 2003, the [[Australian Vice-Chancellors’ Committee]] (AVCC), the council of [[Australia]]’s university presidents, put forward a “Chancellors and AVCC statement on university governance."  Given national and institutional debates over the governance of tertiary education, the statement acknowledges the opportunities with developments in management and governing structures.  The statement notes the role of the “business model” that has been advanced alongside the traditional models of governance in Australia.  With reference to additional “third models” in introducing a discussion of the existing frameworks for the governance of tertiary education, the statement defines the legal autonomy of institutions and independence from external [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].  Acknowledging the diversity of governing structures and believing a balance is necessary between internal and external forces, the organization maintains:  “No single way to achieve an effective governance arrangement” is possible.{{sfn|AVCC|2003|p=3}}  In recognizing the differences in institutional structures and frames of reference, the statement offers operational good practices as generic principles and recommendations, also identifying national protocols for the success of Australian higher education.

The recommendations address practices by which internal governing structures operate and how they can improve institutional governance for the Commonwealth of Australia.  External relations, the role of faculty and students in governance are not approached except inasmuch as institutional board members should be appointed with their selection based on contributions “to the effective working of the governing body by having needed skills, knowledge and experience, an appreciation of the values of a university and its core activities of teaching and research, its independence and academic freedom and the capacity to appreciate the university’s external community needs from that university”.{{sfn|AVCC|2003|p=6}}  The committee defines the [[Moral responsibility|responsibilities]] of university governance, including legal obligations and legislative requirements for the internal governing boards of Australian institutions.  Accordingly, governing bodies “should make available a programme of induction and professional development . . . to ensure that all members are aware of the nature of their duties and responsibilities”.{{sfn|AVCC|2003|p=6}}  The report concludes with protocol for annual reports, including report of risk management and additional steps to ensure [[good governance]].

==Africa==
The Pan-African Institute of University Governance is a project set up by the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie and by the Association of Commonwealth universities, in support of the Ministry of the higher education of Cameroon. It was launched during the World Conference on the Higher education of the UNESCO which was held in Paris from 5 to 8 July 2009, by the Rector of the AUF, Mr Bernard Cerquiglini, and the General Secretary of the ACU Mr John Tarrant.

Based physically at the Yaounde - Cameroon, it is about a unique structure of support which aims at improving all the practices which contribute to the smooth running of higher education in Africa. Its vocation is to accompany the modernization of the governance of higher education thanks to the implementation of expertise, the modules of training, seminars and workshops and especially specific tools of management, analysis and evaluation. It spreads his actions on the whole domain of governance (academic, administrative, financial, social, numerical and of the research) and has a function of observatory of higher education in Africa.

At this effect, the Institute founds its methods of work on its role of observatory of higher education, on its expertise in evaluation of mechanisms of functioning and decision-making in establishments, and thus on its capacity of analysis of the modes and tools of management of higher education.

The Institute’s action is founded around five major challenges:
*a challenge of efficiency to develop the universities’ practices of governance and make them real actors of the development. 
*a technical challenge to help universities rationalize their means and realize in best their missions
*a strategic challenge by the pooling of tools and the exchange of the good practices
*an African challenge to realize an African community of higher education which transcends the language and political barriers
*a political challenge through its network of partners and experts.

The activities of the Institute in 2009–2010 are articulate around three types of actions:
*the effective launch of the Institute
*the knowledge of the mechanisms of university governance through two inquiries
*initiatives of training, information and promotion.

The Institute works in partnership with stakeholders and international institutions to accompany initiatives and realize actions which can contribute to the improvement of the functioning of higher education and more widely education in Africa.

The philosophy of this Institute expands dialogue and shared experience between African university leaders on issues related to university governance. Methods will step out from the classical models of cooperation in which the "expertise" of the North are transmitted to “addressee” and “consignee” of the South, leading to the principals and attitudes of copy-write. African Universities can only develop if they succeed in inventing their own policies and procedures, all by taking into consideration international standards.

To assist universities in the accomplishment of their missions in an efficient and modern way, the Pan-African Institute of University Governance shall make use of the relationship it has with partners such as the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF) and the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU).

The AUF-ACU partnership consists of two joined visions. Rounding on common objectives and shared missions, Anglophones, Francophones, Lusophones and Arabic-speakers will better enrich discussions on how to develop higher educational system. This illustrates the importance taken by cultural diversity in the World today, being an essential basis for development inside more harmonized globalization which takes into account each person’s identity and values. Therefore, our approach is that of the exchange of experience and good practices likely to be widespread within the framework of our institutions that most frequently lack real communication.

About governance : Two approaches shall enable us to tackle the problems of higher education institutions’ governance in Africa. The first one is current. It consists of rationalizing, valorizing and modernizing both the university foundations and their various systems of functioning. It supposes to put on better the whole university structure : better management, transparency in the decision-making and the participation of all actors in the decision-making. The second approach of governance fundamentally questions the efficiency of the systems of functioning of universities, too much centered on the hierarchical authority of the State, and on that of the university and academic administration, whether it is to define the financing, programs, the qualifications and even the courses of training. The governance of higher education will succeed only if it allows creating a common space of meeting between the actors : political, socioeconomic, students, teaching and civil society.

==South Africa==
[[File:UCT Jammie steps.jpg|thumb|Jameson Hall at the [[University of Cape Town]]]]
[[South Africa]] faces issues related to the governance of their tertiary system of higher education that correlate with international trends.  Hall and Symes (2005) discuss the state of South African higher education in the first decade of the country’s [[constitutional democracy]] at a time when the country has faced not only democratic transition but also the end of Apartheid racial segregation.  With the South African transition to democracy in 1994, the national government and institutions of postsecondary learning envisioned the [[cooperative]] governance of higher education.  For a developing country that faced “massive social exclusion” for the better part of a century – only to be challenged in the 1970s and 1980s –  traditional models for governance in higher education, European and North American models of institutional autonomy are not entirely applicable to the South African context.{{sfn|Hall and Symes|2005|pp=205-206}}  The authors discuss the need for government “steering,” an idea originally envisioned in South Africa with the democratic transition, based upon a cooperative framework as a “conditional autonomy.”  The goals and objectives for cooperative governance were thus established with the National Commission on Higher Education (NCHE) in 1994, detailed in its 1996 report.

The South African National Commission on Higher Education was meant to serve as a “[[Buffer solution|buffer]] mechanism” between government and institutions to establish a [[system]] by which “autonomous higher education institutions would work in a range of partnerships with government and other stakeholders,” from the involvement of state supervision and consultation.{{sfn|Hall and Symes|2005|pp=200,204,210}}   Within the initial years of the democratic transition and the end of the [[Apartheid]], Hall and Symes (2005) note that the national government assumed a much stronger [[regulatory]] and [[bureaucratic]] control of South African postsecondary institutions than what had been originally expected.  From the appointments to the National Commission on Higher Education, the 1997 Higher Education Act, and the 2001 National Plan for Higher Education, the national government has assumed direct command of [[curriculum]], funding and regulation over institutions with “weak or non-existent traditions of academic freedom”.{{sfn|Hall and Symes|2005|pp=201-202}}

Where the 1997 Higher Education Act and [[minister (government)|ministerial]] appointments provided the framework by which the national government could assert control over postsecondary institutions, the 2001 Education Amendment Act and [[white paper]] expressed the government’s motivations to take a strong position of power in the governance of South African higher education.  Whereby, the “period from the 1997 White Paper to the 2001 National Plan for Higher Education has seen a systematic tightening of state control and the [[erosion]] of both the procedural and substantive autonomy of individual institutions”.{{sfn|Hall and Symes|2005|p=210}}   Furthermore, Hall and Symes note that while the ten universities reserved for white students during the apartheid maintained substantial autonomy, other institutions such as [[technical schools]] and “branches of the racially defined government bureaucracy,” continued to be governed by tight government intervention.{{sfn|Hall and Symes|2005|pp=201-202}}   The authors do not reject the need for government “steering,” and cooperative governance with the national government for the [[developing country]].  Nonetheless, where the concept of conditional [[autonomy]] remained vague with its vision in 1996, the authors suggest that given the direction the government and NCHE have taken, there need be a rethinking of the relationship between institutions and the newly established democratic government.

==Other European countries==
Institutions of tertiary higher education in Europe have been under reform, following the common goals and objectives to develop new models for institutional governance.  Sporn, writing for [[EDUCAUSE]], discusses the restructuring of higher education with “notions of new public management", which the author correlates to neoliberal economic models.{{sfn|Sporn|2003|p=31}}  The author directly relates these currents in the management of European [[higher education]] with the influence of U.S. models for approaching change in higher education. The European countries of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] are provided as additional examples of the new managerialism in tertiary education.{{sfn|Sporn|2003|p=33}}  In both Norway and Sweden, each have emphasized restructuring based on in vogue [[international]] trends with different approaches to reform that are characterized as common to continental Europe.  New organizational forms for governance and [[leadership]] with the diversification of higher education have emphasized maintaining institutional [[autonomy]], harmonizing institutional standards, and expanding higher education with goals related to the neoliberal market model of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Higher Degree Research By Numbers: Beyond the Critiques of Neo-liberalism| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Liam | last2= Grealy | journal=Higher Education Research &amp; Development  | volume= 36 | issue= 3 | pages= 458–471 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31833744/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stressing quality of learning and leadership within higher education, restructuring by way of the key catchphrases such as accountability, changing management in Europe also includes providing for human resource goals such as [[staff development]].

Significant among these changes is the establishment of governing and coordinating boards with [[decision-making]] structures for collaboration in external and internal governance of higher education (as done in many states within the United States).  Believing that there will be either a [[wikt:convergence|convergence]] or [[divergence]] between a strong administrative managerialism and faculty involvement in governance throughout Europe, the UK and U.S., the example of the system in [[Austria]] illustrates the potential for innovative approaches that grant autonomy to institutions with restructuring through an external board.  In conclusion, Sporn believes the new governing structures provide stronger leadership and management, but that institutions "should pay close attention to the role of faculty and shared governance."{{sfn|Sporn|2003|p=41}}

==United Kingdom==
{{seealso|Universities in the UK|UK enterprise law|Ancient university governance in Scotland}}
[[File:Old_Clarendon_Building_3_(5649801503).jpg|thumb| [[Clarendon Building]] at the [[University of Oxford]], formerly home to the university's central administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The University of Oxford: A New History

Changes in the [[United Kingdom]]’s system of higher education are given as examples of [[neoliberal]] economic models.  Increased managerialism with economic privatization and minimizing internal governing structures are common themes in the restructuring of UK higher education, which entails the “erosion of the power of unions and professionals and the increased importance of managers and nonexecutive, nonelected directors.{{sfn|Sporn|2003|p=32}}  In general, the new [[managerialism]] in Europe involves four different trends:

* [[Economic efficiency|Efficiency]] in finances with stronger managerial controls and deregulation of the [[Labour (economics)|labor]] market, i.e. ''the Efficiency Drive''.
* [[Layoff|Downsizing]] and [[Decentralization]], breaking up large institutions into smaller peripherary units with a small centralized managerial core and a split between public and private funding.
* [[Excellence]], the ''In Search For Excellence Model'', which focuses on a more [[Human resources|human resource]] approach to institutional change with a mix of top-down and bottom-up organization
* [[public services|Public Service]], with the merging of both public and private managerial practices.

[[File:StateLibQld 1 395493 Ipswich Grammar School sketch, 1873.jpg|thumb|Sketch of Ipswich Grammar School, 1873]]
The '''Grammar Schools Act 1860'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/Leg_Info/repealed_annotations/Tab2_RepChro_1860_1934.pdf|title=Information - Queensland Legislation - Queensland Government|website=www.legislation.qld.gov.au|accessdate=19 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231125/http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/Leg_Info/repealed_annotations/Tab2_RepChro_1860_1934.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was passed by [[Queensland]]'s first parliament in 1860 and allowed for the establishment of a grammar school in any town where [[Australian pound|£]]1000 could be raised locally. Between the years 1863 and 1892, ten [[grammar school]]s were opened under the auspices of the Act. The first of these was [[Ipswich Grammar School]], which opened in 1863.
[[File:Brisbane First Grammar School.jpg|thumb|Brisbane Grammar School, 1874 (the school would later move to Gregory Terrace)]]

==History of the Act==
The Grammar Schools Act was the fourth bill of the first [[parliament of Queensland]]. Along with the ''Primary Schools Act (Qld)'' 1860, it aimed to bring [[Queensland]] under one general and comprehensive education system without prejudice.
[[File:Toowoomba Grammar School, sketch prior to construction, 1875.JPG|thumb|Toowoomba Grammar School, sketch prior to construction, 1875]]
In the early years of Australian education, [[denominational]] schools (particularly [[Anglican]] schools) had a large influence. These schools were criticised over a number of decades for proliferating a social divide, and providing poor and biased education.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} By the time of the first [[parliament of Queensland]] in 1860, there was a general feeling that any system of education established in [[Queensland]] should be free of [[denominationalism]].

The Act received little opposition in either House of [[parliament of Queensland|Parliament]] – revealing its popularity. It found the approval of the public in general, and even amongst sections of the [[Anglican]] community. The Act marked a departure from the education systems in place in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]], where schools were generally tied up with respective religious bodies or (in the case of schools such as [[Sydney Grammar School]]) being provided massive, ineffective endowments, with little effort required from the community.
[[File:StateLibQld 1 40063 Brisbane Girls Grammar School, ca. 1905.jpg|thumb|Brisbane Girls Grammar School, circa 1905]]
[[File:StateLibQld 1 67156 Grammar School, Townsville, ca. 1905.jpg|thumb|Townsville Grammar School, circa 1905]]
The main points of the Act are summarised below. Basically, the Act allowed for the establishment of a grammar school in any town where [[Australian pound|£]]1000 could be raised locally. The [[Queensland Government]] then matched that figure. The Schools were to be administered by a seven-member Board of Trustees, of which four members were appointed by the [[Governor of Queensland|Governor]]. The Act also made provision for public scholarships for students to attend university in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] or the southern states of [[Australia]].
[[File:Ipswich Girls' Grammar School, 1894.jpg|thumb|Ipswich Girls' Grammar School, 1894]]
The act was repealed in 1975 and replaced with the [[Grammar Schools Act 1975]].

==Schools opened under the Act==
[[File:Rockhampton Girls Grammar School.jpg|thumb|Rockhampton Girls Grammar School, circa 1895]]
There were ten grammar schools opened under the Act – eight of which remain open today. In chronological order, they were:

#[[Ipswich Grammar School]] for boys (1863)
#[[Brisbane Grammar School]] for boys (1868)
#[[Toowoomba Grammar School]] for boys (1875)
#[[Brisbane Girls Grammar School]] (1875)
#[[Rockhampton Grammar School]] initially for boys and girls, later only for boys (1881)
#[[Maryborough Grammar School]] for boys (1881)
#[[Maryborough Girls Grammar School]] (1883)
#[[Townsville Grammar School]] for boys and girls (1888)
#[[Ipswich Girls Grammar School]] (1892)
#[[Rockhampton Girls Grammar School]] (1892)

When it opened in 1881, [[Rockhampton Grammar School]] was [[co-educational]]. Only four years later, the Board of Trustees decided to exclude females from the School, leading to the construction of [[Rockhampton Girls Grammar School]]. The latter opened on 11 March 1892 – one day after the official opening of [[Ipswich Girls Grammar School]]. (Females were readmitted to [[Rockhampton Grammar School]] in 1977 after a 92-year absence).

In 1936, hit hard by the effects of the [[Great Depression]], the Maryborough Grammar School and Maryborough Girls Grammar School were forced to close. They were subsequently taken over by the Department of Education, [[Queensland Government]], and renamed the Maryborough State High and Intermediate School for Boys and Maryborough State High and Intermediate School for Girls. In 1974, these schools merged to become the [[Maryborough State High School]].

==Main Points of the Act==
The main aspects of the Act were as follows:

*That where [[Australian pound|£]]1000 was raised by donation or subscription in any district for the purpose of establishing a Grammar School, then the [[Governor of Queensland|Governor]] (with the advice of the Executive Council), if satisfied with the proposed School, paid to the Trustees "a sum not exceeding the amount raised".
*That when fees to the amount of [[Australian pound|£]]250 per annum were promised for a period of not less than three years, the [[Governor of Queensland|Governor]] (with the advice of the Executive Council) shall pay out of the general revenue of the Colony [[Australian pound|£]]500 to the credit of the Trustees, towards the upkeep of the School.
* A body of seven persons, to be called the Trustees of the School, were to be elected. Four of those seven were to be nominated by the [[Governor of Queensland|Governor]] (with the advice of the Executive Council), whilst the other three were to be elected by vote of subscribers of over [[Australian pound|£]]5 to the funds of the School.
*The [[Governor of Queensland|Governor]] (with the advice of the Executive Council) was permitted to, in any one year, reserve 10% of the amount payable to a School to provide for scholarships to any [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[Australia|Australian]] [[university]]. Such scholarships were awarded after public competitive examinations.

''This article refers to the 2002 Canadian film, for the 2002 American film [[Home Room (film)|click here]].''

'''''Heart of America''''' (also released as '''''Home Room''''') is a 2002 Canadian-German [[Drama Film|drama film]] written and directed by [[Uwe Boll]] about the events leading up to and revolving around a [[school shooting|shooting]] on the final day of school. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Jürgen Prochnow]], [[Michael Paré]], [[Elisabeth Moss]], [[Patrick Muldoon]], [[Clint Howard]], and [[Brendan Fletcher]]. The film also addresses the issue of [[school bullying]].

==Plot {{Anchor|Synopsis}}==
The last day of school contains many problems for both teachers and students of Riverside High School, and there are multiple storylines about this.

The principal, Harold Lewis, must discipline [[English studies|English]] teacher William Pratt, who has let his professional frustrations get the better of him, while guidance counselor Vanessa Jones attempts to get through to student drug dealer Wex Presley, who is ruining her students.

Meanwhile, Principal Lewis' daughter, Karen, is having trouble with her boyfriend, Tommy Bruno, outcast Dara McDermott craves drugs, a [[pregnant]] girl named Robin Walters argues with her boyfriend, Kevin Rhodes about her future options; and [[bullying|bully]] Ricky Herman begins to recognize the consequences of his actions.

Unbeknownst to these people, two bullied students and best friends Daniel Lynne and Barry Shultz are about to shoot up the school as an act of revenge against their tormentors. Barry, however, is having second thoughts, while the seething Daniel prepares to unleash his rage. Daniel decides to attack his high school on the last day, insisting that he does not care if he lives or dies, tired of constant harshness and abuse from his uncaring father, Artie and from bullies at school; Ricky amongst them. On the last day, Daniel carries out his plan, aided by Dara who spontaneously joins him. Daniel confronts three of his past tormentors: Paul, Ricky, and Jeff and kills them. Kevin is shot and killed when he and Robin come into the line of fire, much to Daniel's regret while Robin is spared. Meanwhile, Dara walks into her English class and kills Mr. Pratt, and Karen, who had been a rival for the attentions of Tommy. Dara is then subdued by bully Donny Pritzee and is turned over to the police. Barry walks away from the school, having bailed out on the plan, believing there are other responses to the abuse he and Daniel suffered in the past. A lone gunshot then rings out as Daniel commits suicide.

As the film ends, a reporter informs the public of the school shooting, revealing that Daniel committed suicide, and the camera turns away from the TV to show Barry's and Daniel's shocked parents watching. At Daniel's home, the phone begins to ring, but Artie cannot bring himself to pick it up. The film then ends as a voice lists off major incidents of violence perpetrated by minors.

== Background ==
Helping Minds is a group of about 200 volunteers, rendering academic and financial aid to rural poor students in [[Tamil Nadu]], helping scores to pursue engineering, medical and polytechnic courses. Every month, each member contributes a minimum of Rs 100, with proceeds donated to deserving poor students.

The trust extends financial help to students identified and validated by the members. Those having consistently very good academic records and hailing from poor families are given priority. Their assistance has helped scores of students pursue engineering, medicine, polytechnic, paramedical and other job-oriented courses. The beneficiaries have now settled in top jobs, members said.
    
During the past three years, the trust has donated around Rs 5.5 lakh to over 40 students, in addition to developing infrastructure in about ten government schools. Helping Minds Trust was awarded 'Unsung Heroes' award by PrimePoint Foundation, a city based NGO.

{{Lowercase|title=iBOT}}

The '''iBOT''' is a powered [[wheelchair]] developed by [[Dean Kamen]] in a partnership between [[DEKA (company)|DEKA]] and [[Johnson and Johnson]]'s '''Independence Technology''' division.

==History==
Development of the iBOT started in 1990 with the first working prototypes available in 1992 and then in late 1994, DEKA signed a deal with [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] to manufacture the unit, with Johnson &amp; Johnson paying for all subsequent R&amp;D with DEKA receiving a smaller royalty fee than they normally would in return for their retaining rights to all non-medical applications of the technology.

The iBOT was revealed to the public on [[Dateline NBC]] in a segment by [[John Hockenberry]] on June 30, 1999.&lt;ref name="Michigan State"&gt;{{cite web|title=The iBOT|url=https://msu.edu/~luckie/segway/iBOT/iBOT.html|website=msu.edu|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kemper|first1=Steve|title=Code Name Ginger: The Story Behind Segway and Dean Kamen's Quest to Invent a New World|publisher=Harvard Business Press|isbn=9781578516735|page=53|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dateline Transcript"&gt;{{cite web|title=A whole new set of wheels|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3079872/ns/dateline_nbc/t/whole-new-set-wheels/#.V1C61fkrLIU|website=msnbc.com|accessdate=2 June 2016|date=26 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Johnson &amp; Johnson had already spent {{currency|50 million}} on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kemper|first1=Steve|title=Code name Ginger : the story behind segway and Dean Kamen's quest to invent a new world|date=2003|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=9781578516735|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iBOT entered clinical trials in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Bob|title=CNN - More than a wheelchair, the IBOT is on the move - November 26, 1999|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9911/26/ibot.idg/|website=www.cnn.com|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with FDA approval arriving four years after the reveal on August 13, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|title=Recently-Approved Devices - INDEPENDENCE™ iBOT™ 3000 Mobility System – P020033|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm082381.htm|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=2 June 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During development the iBot was nicknamed Fred after [[Fred Astaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kemper|first1=Steve|title=Code name Ginger : the story behind segway and Dean Kamen's quest to invent a new world|date=2003|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=9781578516735|page=27|accessdate=23 June 2016|quote=One day, goofing around, they rotated them in opposite directions, which made the machine dip and jig in a crazy rumba that led someone to remark that it danced like Fred Astaire.

Starting in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Johnson &amp; Johnson |title=Official Website |url=http://www.ibotnow.com/index.htm |date=2008-12-21 |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the iBOT was no longer available for sale from Independence Technology, but support for existing units was available until the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibotnow.com/ iBOT homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217222556/http://www.ibotnow.com/ |date=2007-02-17 }}, retrieved 10 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Production was discontinued for cost reasons; only a few hundred were sold per year at a retail price of about $25,000, and Medicare paid $5000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2011/12/26/ibot-johnson-phase|title=iBOT’s End Puts Power Wheelchair’s Users In Tough Spot|publisher=WBUR Here &amp; Now|date=26 Dec 2011|accessdate=20 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stair-climbing wheelchair comes to a halt|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30929301/ns/health-health_care/t/stair-climbing-wheelchair-comes-halt/|website=msnbc.com|accessdate=2 June 2016|date=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Dean Kamen, the inventor of the iBOT, stated his support of America's Huey 091 Foundation's effort to reinstate iBOT production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huey091foundation.org |title=Huey091 &gt; Home |publisher=Huey091foundation.org |date=2011-12-18 |accessdate=2012-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213224446/http://huey091foundation.org/ |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014, Kamen announced that the FDA had reclassified the iBOT from a Class III to a Class II medical device. This lowering of regulatory controls will allow DEKA to revive the long dormant iBOT and immediately start building a next generation product. Kamen said the model would be out in “less than two years" and would be available initially to wounded veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilehydraulictips.com/dean-kamen-leadership-engineering/|title=Dean Kamen—Leadership in Engineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Toyota]] and DEKA formed a partnership to produce a new version of the iBOT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iBOT Poised for Comeback {{pipe}} Corporate|url=http://corporatenews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/toyota-deka-research-partnership-may21.htm|website=corporatenews.pressroom.toyota.com|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The iBOT has a number of features distinguishing it from most powered wheelchairs:

* By rotating its two sets of powered wheels about each other, the iBOT can "walk" up and down stairs, much like a cog railway or a rack and pinion with the two wheels as the "teeth" of the gear.  The wheels can roll slightly at each step to compensate for a wide range of stair dimensions. When stair-climbing without assistance, the user requires a sturdy handrail and a strong grip.  With an assistant, neither a handrail nor a strong grip is required.
* The iBOT is capable of tethered remote control operation, useful for loading the wheelchair up ramps into vehicles, or "parking" out of the way when not occupied.
* Custom software receives data via various sensors and gyroscopes, allowing the iBOT to maintain balance during certain maneuvers. For example, during curb climbing the seat remains level while parts of the chassis tilt to climb the curb.
* It allows the user to rise from a sitting level to approximately 6' tall, measured from the ground to the top of the head, and depending on the size of the occupant. It does this by raising one pair of wheels above the other to elevate the chassis, while a separate actuator raises the seat slightly more than usual.  In this configuration the device is on two wheels, and the 'iBALANCE' software and gyroscope signals control the iBOT to maintain equilibrium, balancing much like the [[Segway PT|Segway]] scooter (which was a spin-off from the iBOT development). The user may also travel in this "standing" configuration.
* It can climb and descend curbs ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 inches, according to the manufacturer's specifications.  The limits are determined by the rider's technique and risk tolerance.
* It is capable of traveling through many types of terrain, including sand, gravel, and water up to 3" deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://arthritis.about.com/cs/assist/a/stairclimbwc.htm| title=Stair-Climbing Wheelchair - iBOT Mobility System| publisher=About.com| accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrated learning systems''' are [[computer hardware|hardware]]/[[software]] solutions designed to deliver instructional content. The effective delivery of that content is measured, monitored, and maintained with an array of assessment and management tools that may also be part of that system. 

Integrated learning systems are generally associated with educational/academic environments, but are also deployed within private industry, for example, as a way to introduce employees to new, mission critical systems and software applications.

As opposed to static online help or even animated tutorials, integrated learning systems are highly interactive and are designed to provide [[feedback]] as to progress and grasp of the subject matter at hand. Built-in tools further allow executive management or instructors and trainers to monitor and measure a student's progress.

'''Janette Atkinson''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|FBA|FMedSci}} is a British [[psychologist]] and academic, specialising in the [[Infant visual development|human development of vision]] and [[visual cognition]]. She was [[Professor (highest academic rank)|Professor]] of Psychology at [[University College London]] from 1993: she is now [[Emeritus Professor]]. She was also Co-Director of the Visual Development Unit at the Department of Psychology, University College London and the Department of Experimental Psychology, [[University of Oxford]]. She is a frequent collaborator with her husband [[Oliver Braddick]].

==Early life and education==
Atkinson studied [[psychology]] at the [[University of Bristol]], graduating with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in 1965.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atkinson Braddick Celebration|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/vdu/abc/about.html|website=University College London|accessdate=1 November 2017|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to undertake [[postgraduate studies]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], and she completed her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1970.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt; Her doctoral thesis was titled "A study of perceptual analysis using stabilized images".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Janette|first1=Atkinson|title=A study of perceptual analysis using stabilized images|url=http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.448331|website=E-Thesis Online Service|publisher=The British Library Board|accessdate=1 November 2017|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38472">In [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]], [[archetype]]s are highly developed elements of the [[collective unconscious]]. The existence of archetypes can only be deduced indirectly by using story, art, myths, religions, or dreams. [[Carl Jung]] understood archetypes as universal, archaic patterns and images that derive from the collective unconscious and are the psychic counterpart of [[instinct]].&lt;ref name="FeistFeist"&gt;Feist J, Feist GJ, (2009) ''Theories of Personality'', New York New York; McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; They are inherited potentials which are actualized when they enter consciousness as images or manifest in behavior on interaction with the outside world.&lt;ref name="Stevens 2006"/&gt; They are autonomous and hidden forms which are transformed once they enter consciousness and are given particular expression by individuals and their cultures.

In theory, '''Jungian archetypes''' refer to unclear underlying forms or the ''archetypes-as-such'' from which emerge images and motifs such as the [[mother]], the child, the [[trickster]], and [[Flood myth|the flood]] among others. History, culture and personal context shape these manifest representations thereby giving them their specific content. These images and motifs are more precisely called ''archetypal images''. However it is common for the term ''archetype'' to be used interchangeably to refer to both ''archetypes-as-such'' and ''archetypal images''.&lt;ref name="Stevens 2006"&gt;Stevens, Anthony in "The archetypes" (Chapter 3.) Ed. Papadopoulos, Renos. The Handbook of Jungian Psychology (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:D369-platon.-L2-Ch8.png|thumb|150px|frameless|right|Jung's ideas on archetypes were based in part on Plato's Forms]]
Jung rejected the ''[[tabula rasa]]'' theory of human psychological development, believing instead that evolutionary pressures have individual predestinations manifested in archetypes. Jung first used the term ''primordial images'' to refer to what he would later term  "archetypes". Jung's idea of archetypes was based on [[Immanuel Kant]]'s categories, [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of Forms|Ideas]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;Jung and the Post-Jungians, Andrew Samuels, Routledge (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  For Jung, "the archetype is the introspectively recognizable form of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' psychic orderedness".&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Synchronicity'' (London 1985) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; "These images must be thought of as lacking in solid content, hence as unconscious. They only acquire solidity, influence, and eventual consciousness in the encounter with empirical facts."&lt;ref&gt;Jung 1928:Par. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

The archetypes form a dynamic substratum common to all humanity, upon the foundation of which each individual builds his own experience of life, colouring them with his unique culture, personality and life events. Thus, while archetypes themselves may be conceived as a relative few innate nebulous forms, from these may arise innumerable images, symbols and patterns of behavior. While the emerging images and forms are apprehended consciously, the archetypes which inform them are elementary structures which are unconscious and impossible to apprehend.

Jung was fond of comparing the form of the archetype to the axial system of a crystal, which preforms the crystalline structure of the mother liquid, although it has no material existence of its own. This first appears according to the specific way in which the ions and molecules aggregate. The archetype in itself is empty and purely formal: a possibility of representation which is given ''a priori''. The representations themselves are not inherited, only the forms, and in that respect they correspond to the instincts. The existence of the instincts can no more be proved than the existence of the archetypes, so long as they do not manifest themselves concretely.&lt;ref&gt;(CW 9, pt 1, para. 155)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jung 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|left|200px|Carl Jung standing in front of Burghölzli clinic, Zurich 1909]]
The intuition that there was more to the psyche than individual experience possibly began in Jung's childhood. The very first dream he could remember was that of an underground phallic [[god]]. Later in life his research on [[psychotic]] patients in Burgholzli Hospital and his own self-analysis later supported his early intuition about the existence of universal psychic structures that underlie all human experience and behavior. Jung first referred to these as "primordial images" – a term he borrowed from [[Jacob Burckhardt]]. Later in 1917 Jung called them "dominants of the collective unconscious."

It was not until 1919 that he first used the term "archetypes" in an essay titled "Instinct and the Unconscious". The first element in Greek `arche' signifies 'beginning, origin, cause, primal source principle', but it also signifies 'position of a leader, supreme rule and government' (in other words a kind of 'dominant'): the second element 'type' means 'blow and what is produced by a blow, the imprint of a coin ...form, image, prototype, model, order, and norm', ...in the figurative, modern sense, 'pattern underlying form, primordial form'.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Anthony Archetype Revisited: an Updated Natural History of the Self. Toronto, ON.: Inner City Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years Jung revised and broadened the concept of archetypes even further, conceiving of them as psycho-physical patterns existing in the universe, given specific expression by human consciousness and culture. Jung proposed that the archetype had a dual nature: it exists both in the psyche and in the world at large. He called this non-psychic aspect of the archetype the "psychoid" archetype.

Jung drew an analogy between the psyche and [[light]] on the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The center of the visible light spectrum (i.e., yellow) corresponds to consciousness, which grades into unconsciousnessness at the red and blue ends. Red corresponds to basic unconscious urges, and the invisible infra-red end of the spectrum corresponds to the influence of biological [[instinct]], which merges with its chemical and physical conditions. The blue end of the spectrum represents spiritual ideas; and the archetypes, exerting their influence from beyond the visible, correspond to the invisible realm of ultra-violet.&lt;ref name=JungVol8par420&gt;Jung, C.G. (1947/1954/1960), ''Collected Works'' vol. 8, ''The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche'', pp. 187, 211–216 (¶384, 414–420). "Just as the 'psychic infra-red,' the biological instinctual psyche, gradually passes over into the physiology of the organism and thus merges with its chemical and physical conditions, so the 'psychic ultra-violet,' the archetype, describes a field which exhibits none of the peculiarities of the physiological and yet, in the last analysis, can no longer be regarded as psychic, although it manifests itself psychically."&lt;/ref&gt; Jung suggested that not only do the archetypal structures govern the behavior of all living organisms, but that they were contiguous with structures controlling the behavior of inorganic matter as well.

The archetype was not merely a psychic entity, but more fundamentally, a bridge to matter in general.&lt;ref name=JungVol8par420 /&gt; Jung used the term ''[[unus mundus]]'' to describe the unitary reality which he believed underlay all manifest [[Phenomenon|phenomena]]. He conceived archetypes to be the mediators of the ''unus mundus'', organizing not only ideas in the psyche, but also the fundamental principles of matter and energy in the physical world.

It was this psychoid aspect of the archetype that so impressed Nobel laureate physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]]. Embracing Jung's concept, Pauli believed that the archetype provided a link between [[Event (philosophy)|physical events]] and the mind of the [[scientist]] who studied them. In doing so he echoed the position adopted by German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]]. Thus the archetypes that ordered our perceptions and ideas are themselves the product of an objective order that transcends both the human mind and the external world.&lt;ref name="Stevens 2006"/&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Processed SAM loki.jpg|thumb|The Norse trickster god [[Loki]] as depicted on an 18th-century [[Icelandic Manuscript, SÁM 66|Icelandic manuscript]]]]
Jung described '''archetypal events''': birth, death, separation from parents, initiation, marriage, the union of opposites; '''archetypal figures''': great mother, father, [[Child (archetype)|child]], [[devil]], [[god]], [[wise old man]], [[Wise Old Woman/Man|wise old woman]], the [[trickster]], the [[hero]]; and '''archetypal motifs''': the apocalypse, the deluge, the creation. Although the number of archetypes is limitless, there are a few particularly notable, recurring archetypal images, "the chief among them being" (according to Jung) "the ''shadow'', the ''wise old man'', the ''child'', the ''mother'' ... and her counterpart, the ''maiden'', and lastly the ''anima'' in man and the ''animus'' in woman".&lt;ref&gt;Jung, quoted in J. Jacobi, ''Complex, Archetype, Symbol'' (London 1959) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively he would speak of "the emergence of certain definite archetypes ... the shadow, the animal, the wise old man, the anima, the animus, the mother, the child".&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Self in Jungian psychology|Self]] designates the whole range of psychic phenomena in man. It expresses the unity of the personality as a whole.

The [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] is a representation of the personal unconscious as a whole and usually embodies the compensating values to those held by the conscious personality. Thus, the shadow often represents one's dark side, those aspects of oneself that exist, but which one does not acknowledge or with which one does not identify.&lt;ref name="Fordham 1985"&gt;Fordham, Michael Explorations Into the Self (library of Analytical Psychology) Karnac Books, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anima and animus|anima]] archetype appears in men and is his primordial image of woman. It represents the man's sexual expectation of women, but also is a symbol of a man's possibilities, his contrasexual tendencies. The [[Anima and animus|animus]] archetype is the analogous image of the masculine that occurs in women.

Any attempt to give an exhaustive list of the archetypes, however, would be a largely futile exercise since the archetypes tend to combine with each other and interchange qualities making it difficult to decide where one archetype stops and another begins. For example, qualities of the shadow archetype may be prominent in an archetypal image of the anima or animus. One archetype may also appear in various distinct forms, thus raising the question whether four or five distinct archetypes should be said to be present or merely four or five forms of a single archetype.&lt;ref name="Fordham 1985"/&gt;

==Conceptual difficulties==
[[File:Usnisavijaya.jpg|thumb|left| Strictly speaking the goddess archetype is more properly called an archetypal image]]
Popular and new-age uses have often condensed the concept of archetypes into an enumeration of archetypal figures such as the hero, the goddess, the wise man and so on. Such enumeration falls short of apprehending the fluid core concept. Strictly speaking, archetypal figures such as the hero, the goddess and the wise man are not archetypes, but archetypal images which have crystallized out of the ''archetypes-as-such'': as Jung put it, "definite mythological images of motifs ... are nothing more than conscious representations; it would be absurd to assume that such variable representations could be inherited", as opposed to their deeper, instinctual sources – "the 'archaic remnants', which I call 'archetypes' or 'primordial images'".&lt;ref name="Jung p. 57"&gt;Jung, "Approaching the Unconscious" in Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the precise relationships between images such as, for example, "the fish" and its archetype were not adequately explained by Jung. Here the image of the fish is not strictly speaking an archetype. The "archetype of the fish" points to the ubiquitous existence of an innate "fish archetype" which gives rise to the fish image. In clarifying the contentious statement that fish archetypes are universal, [[Anthony Stevens (Jungian analyst)|Anthony Stevens]] explains that the ''archetype-as-such'' is at once an innate predisposition to form such an image and a preparation to encounter and respond appropriately to the creature ''per se''. This would explain the existence of snake and spider phobias, for example, in people living in urban environments where they have never encountered either creature.&lt;ref name="Stevens 2006"/&gt;

The confusion about the essential quality of archetypes can partly be attributed to Jung's own evolving ideas about them in his writings and his interchangeable use of the term "archetype" and "primordial image". Jung was also intent on retaining the raw and vital quality of archetypes as spontaneous outpourings of the unconscious and not to give their specific individual and cultural expressions a dry, rigorous, intellectually formulated meaning.&lt;ref&gt;M.-L. von Franz, "Science and the unconscious", in Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 386 and p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actualization and complexes==
Archetypes seek actualization within the context of an individual's environment and determine the degree of [[individuation]]. Jung also used the terms "evocation" and "constellation" to explain the process of actualization. Thus for example, the mother archetype is actualized in the mind of the child by the evoking of innate anticipations of the maternal archetype when the child is in the proximity of a maternal figure who corresponds closely enough to its archetypal template. This mother archetype is built into the personal unconscious of the child as a mother ''complex''. Complexes are functional units of the personal unconscious, in the same way that archetypes are units for the collective unconscious.

==Stages of life==
[[File:Sepik River initiation PNG 1975.JPG|right|thumb|150px| An initiation ceremony in Papua New Guinea]]
Archetypes are innate universal pre-conscious psychic dispositions that form the substrate from which the basic themes of human life emerge. The archetypes are components of the [[collective unconscious]] and serve to organize, direct and inform human thought and behaviour. Archetypes hold control of the human life cycle.

As we mature the archetypal plan unfolds through a programmed sequence which Jung called the stages of life. Each stage of life is mediated through a new set of archetypal imperatives which seek fulfillment in action. These may include being parented, initiation, courtship, marriage and preparation for death.&lt;ref&gt;Papadopoulos, Renos ''The Handbook of Jungian Psychology'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

"The archetype is a tendency to form such representations of a motif – representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern ... They are indeed an instinctive ''trend''".&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, "Approaching the Unconscious" in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "the archetype of initiation is strongly activated to provide a meaningful transition ... with a '[[rite of passage]]' from one stage of life to the next":&lt;ref name="Rancour"&gt;Rancour, P. (2008). Using archetypes and transitions theory to help patients move from active treatment to survivorship. [[Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing]]., 12(6), 935-940. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Henderson, "Ancient Myths and Modern Man", in Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; such stages may include being parented, initiation, courtship, marriage and preparation for death.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Anthony in "The Archetypes" (Chapter 3). Papadopoulos, Renos ed. (2006). The Handbook of Jungian Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General developments===
[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] was an advocate of [[structuralism]] in [[anthropology]]. In his approach to the structure and meaning of myth, Levi-Strauss concluded that present phenomena are transformations of earlier structures or infrastructures: 'the structure of primitive thoughts is present in our minds'.

The concept of "social instincts" proposed by [[Charles Darwin]], the "faculties" of [[Henri Bergson]] and the [[isomorph]]s of gestalt psychologist [[Wolfgang Kohler]] are also arguably related to archetypes.

In his work in psycholinguistics, [[Noam Chomsky]] describes an unvarying pattern of language acquisition in children and termed it the [[language acquisition device]]. He refers to 'universals' and a distinction is drawn between 'formal' and 'substantive' universals similar to that between archetype as such (structure) and archetypal image.

[[Jean Piaget]] writes of 'schemata' which are innate and underpin perceptuo-motor activity and the acquisition of knowledge, and are able to draw the perceived environment into their orbit. They resemble archetypes by virtue of their innateness, their activity and their need for environmental correspondence.

===Ethology and attachment theory===
In ''Biological theory and the concept of archetypes'', [[Michael Fordham]] considered that innate release mechanisms in animals may be applicable to humans, especially in infancy. The stimuli which produce instinctive behaviour are selected from a wide field by an innate perceptual system and the behaviour is 'released'. Fordham drew a parallel between some of Lorenz's ethological observations on the hierarchical behaviour of wolves and the functioning of archetypes in infancy.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"&gt;Andrew Samuels, Jung and the Post-Jungians {{ISBN|0415059046}}, Routledge (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens (1982) suggests that ethology and analytical psychology are both disciplines trying to comprehend universal phenomena. Ethology shows us that each species is equipped with unique behavioural capacities that are adapted to its environment and 'even allowing for our greater adaptive flexibility, we are no exception. Archetypes are the neuropsychic centres responsible for co-ordinating the behavioural and psychic repertoire of our species'. Following Bowlby, Stevens points out that genetically programmed behaviour is taking place in the psychological relationship between mother and newborn. The baby's helplessness, its immense repertoire of sign stimuli and approach behaviour, triggers a maternal response. And the smell, sound and shape of mother triggers, for instance, a feeding response.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

===Biology===
Stevens suggests that DNA itself can be inspected for the location and transmission of archetypes. As they are co-terminous with natural life they should be expected wherever life is found. He suggests that DNA is the replicable archetype of the species.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

Stein points out that all the various terms used to delineate the messengers – 'templates, genes, enzymes, hormones, catalysts, pheromones, social hormones' – are concepts similar to archetypes. He mentions archetypal figures which represent messengers such as Hermes, Prometheus or Christ. Continuing to base his arguments on a consideration of biological defence systems he says that it must operate in a whole range of specific circumstances, its agents must be able to go everywhere, the distribution of the agents must not upset the somatic status quo, and, in predisposed persons, the agents will attack the self.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

===Psychoanalysis===
[[File:Melanie Klein 1952.jpg|thumb|140px|Melanie Klein]]
'''[[Melanie Klein]]:''' Melanie Klein's idea of [[Object relations theory#Unconscious Phantasy|unconscious phantasy]] is closely related to Jung's archetype, as both are composed of image and affect and are [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] patternings of [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] whose contents are built from experience.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Lacan2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Jacques Lacan]] --&gt;
'''[[Jacques Lacan]]:''' Lacan went beyond the proposition that the unconscious is a structure that lies beneath the conscious world; the unconscious itself is structured, like a language. This would suggest parallels with Jung. Further Lacan's Symbolic and Imaginary orders may be aligned with Jung's archetypal theory and personal unconscious respectively. The Symbolic order patterns the contents of the Imaginary in the same way that archetypal structures predispose humans towards certain sorts of experience. If we take the example of parents, archetypal structures and the Symbolic order predispose our recognition of, and relation to them.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt; Lacan's concept of the Real approaches Jung's elaboration of the psychoid unconscious, which may be seen as true but cannot be directly known. Lacan posited that the unconscious is organised in an intricate network governed by association, above all 'metaphoric associations'. The existence of the network is shown by analysis of the unconscious products: dreams, symptoms, and so on.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;
[[File:WRBion.jpg|thumb|140px|Wilfred Bion]]
'''[[Wilfred Bion]]''': According to Bion, thoughts precede a thinking capacity. Thoughts in a small infant are indistinguishable from sensory data or unorganised emotion. Bion uses the term proto-thoughts for these early phenomena. Because of their connection to sensory data, proto-thoughts are concrete and self-contained (thoughts-in-themselves), not yet capable of symbolic representations or object relations. The thoughts then function as preconceptions – predisposing psychosomatic entities similar to archetypes. Support for this connection comes from the Kleinian analyst Money-Kyrle's observation that Bion's notion of preconceptions is the direct descendant of [[Theory of Forms|Plato's Ideas]].&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;
[[File:Sigmund Freud 1926.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Sigmund Freud]]
'''[[Sigmund Freud]]''': In the Introductory ''Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (1916-1917) Freud wrote: "There can be no doubt that the source [of the fantasies] lie in the instincts; but it still has to be explained why the same fantasies with the same content are created on every occasion. I am prepared with an answer that I know will seem daring to you. I believe that...primal fantasies, and no doubt a few others as well, are a [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] endowment". His suggestion that primal fantasies are a residue of specific memories of prehistoric experiences have been construed as being aligned with the idea of archetypes. Laplanehe and Pontalis point out that all the so-called primal fantasies relate to the origins and that "like collective myths they claim to provide a representation of and a 'solution' to whatever constitutes an enigma for the child".&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

'''[[Robert Langs]]''': More recently, adaptive psychotherapist and psychoanalyst Robert Langs has used archetypal theory as a way of understanding the functioning of what he calls the "deep unconscious system".&lt;ref&gt;R Langs. ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. (London 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Langs' use of archetypes particularly pertains to issues associated with [[death anxiety (psychology)|death anxiety]], which Langs takes to be the root of psychic conflict. Like Jung, Langs thinks of archetypes as species-wide, deep unconscious factors.&lt;ref&gt;R Langs. ''Freud on a Precipice. How Freud's Fate pushed Psychoanalysis over the Edge''. (Lanham MD: 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurology===
Rossi (1977) suggests that the function and characteristic between left and right cerebral hemispheres may enable us to locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere. He cites research indicating that left hemispherical functioning is primarily verbal and associational, and that of the right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. Thus the left hemisphere is equipped as a critical, analytical, information processor while the right hemisphere operates in a 'gestalt' mode. This means that the right hemisphere is better at getting a picture of a whole from a fragment, is better at working with confused material, is more irrational than the left, and more closely connected to bodily processes. Once expressed in the form of words, concepts and language of the ego's left hemispheric realm, however, they become only representations that 'take their colour' from the individual consciousness. Inner figures such as shadow, anima and animus would be archetypal processes having source in the right hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

Henry (1977) alluded to Maclean's model of the tripartite brain suggesting that the reptilian brain is an older part of the brain and may contain not only drives but archetypal structures as well. The suggestion is that there was a time when emotional behaviour and cognition were less developed and the older brain predominated. There is an obvious parallel with Jung's idea of the archetypes 'crystallising out' over time.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

===Literary criticism===
[[Archetypal literary criticism]] argues that archetypes determine the form and function of literary works, and therefore, that a text's meaning is shaped by cultural and psychological myths. Archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or concretized in recurring images, symbols, or patterns which may include motifs such as the quest or the heavenly ascent, recognizable character types such as the trickster or the hero, symbols such as the apple or snake, or images such as crucifixion (as in King Kong, or Bride of Frankenstein) are all already laden with meaning when employed in a particular work.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

===Psychology===
[[Archetypal psychology]] was developed by [[James Hillman]] in the second half of the 20th century.  Hillman trained at the Jung Institute and was its Director after graduation.  Archetypal psychology is in the Jungian tradition and most directly related to analytical [[psychology]] and [[psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] theory, yet departs radically. Archetypal [[psychology]] relativizes and deliteralizes the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and focuses on the psyche, or [[soul]], itself and the ''archai'', the deepest patterns of psychic functioning, "the fundamental fantasies that animate all life".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, in Hillman, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  Archetypal psychology is a [[polytheistic]] [[psychology]], in that it attempts to recognize the myriad fantasies and [[myths]], [[gods]], [[goddesses]], [[demigods]], [[mortals]] and animals – that shape and are shaped by our psychological lives. The ego is but one psychological [[fantasy]] within an assemblage of fantasies.

The main influence on the development of archetypal psychology is Jung's analytical psychology. It is strongly influenced by Classical [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Renaissance]], and Romantic ideas and thought. Influential artists, poets, philosophers, alchemists, and psychologists include: Nietzsche, Henry Corbin, Keats, Shelley, Petrarch, and Paracelsus. Though all different in their theories and psychologies, they appear to be unified by their common concern for the psyche – the soul.
Many archetypes have been used in treatment of psychological [[illnesses]].  Jung's first research was done with schizophrenics.    A current example is teaching young men or boys archetypes through using picture books to help with the development.&lt;ref&gt;Zambo, D. (2007). Using Picture Books to Provide Archetypes to Young Boys: Extending the Ideas of William Brozo. Reading Teacher, 61(2), 124. Retrieved from EBSCOhost.t.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition nurses treat patients through the use of archetypes.&lt;ref name="Rancour"/&gt; Archetype therapy offers a wide range of uses if applied correctly, and it is still being expanded in Jungian schools today.  With the list of archetypes being endless the healing possibilities are vast.

===Pedagogy===
[[Archetypal pedagogy]] was developed by [[Clifford Mayes]]. Mayes' work also aims at promoting what he calls [[archetypal reflectivity]] in teachers; this is a means of encouraging teachers to examine and work with [[psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] issues, images, and assumptions as those factors affect their [[pedagogical]] practices. More recently the [[Pearson-Marr Archetype Indicator]] (PMAI), based on Jung's theories of both archetypes and personality types, has been used for pedagogical applications (not unlike the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]]).

==In popular culture==
Archetypes abound in contemporary films and literature as they have in creative works of the past, being unconscious projections of the collective unconscious that serve to embody central societal and developmental struggles in a media that entertain as well as instruct. Films are a contemporary form of mythmaking, reflecting our response to ourselves and the mysteries and wonders of our existence.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart VoytiUa, Myth and the Movies, 1999, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==In national trauma==
A contemporary definition is given by O'Brien (2017) as follows: "Archetypes are universal organizing themes or patterns that appear regardless of space, time, or person. Appearing in all existential realms and at all levels of systematic recursion, they are organized as themes in the unus mundus, which Jung (1970 Vol. 14. Mysterium coniunctionis. (1970), p. 505) described as “the potential world outside of time,” and are detectable through synchronicities".&lt;ref&gt;The Healing of Nations, Psychological Perspectives,2017, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[File:Jekyll-mansfield.jpg|thumb|120px|Shadow and Shapeshifter: Jekyll / Hyde]]
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
Contemporary cinema is a rich source of archetypal images, most commonly evidenced for instance in the hero archetype: the one who saves the day and is young and naive, like [[Luke Skywalker]] in ''[[Star Wars]]'', or older and cynical, like [[Rick Blaine]] in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''. The mentor archetype is a common character in all types of films. They can appear and disappear as needed, usually helping the hero in the beginning, and then letting them do the hard part on their own.  The mentor helps train, prepare, encourage and guide the hero. They are obvious in some films: [[Mr. Miyagi]] in ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Jiminy Cricket]] in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', [[Obi-Wan]], and later [[Yoda]] in the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The Shadow, one's darker side, often associated with the villain of numerous films and books, but can be internal as in ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''. The shapeshifter is the person who misleads the hero or who changes frequently and can be depicted quite literally e.g. The T-1000 robot in ''[[Terminator II]]''. The Trickster creates disruptions of the status quo, maybe childlike and help us see the absurdity in situations, provide comic relief; e.g. [[Yoda]] in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Brer Rabbit]]. The Child often innocent; could be someone childlike who needs protecting but may be imbued with special powers (e.g. E.T.). The Bad Father – often seen as a dictator type, or evil and cruel (e.g. Darth Vader in ''Star Wars''). The Bad Mother (e.g. ''[[Mommie Dearest]]''), along with evil stepmothers and wicked witches. The Bad Child; e.g., ''[[The Bad Seed]]'', ''[[The Omen]]''.

Jungian archetypes are heavily integrated into the personalities of the characters in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series of games. In ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]'', the characters with whom you form relationships, (in the game called "Social Links") which are each based on a particular archetype. They are formally differentiated by different [[tarot]] [[major arcana|arcana]], however the primary basis of the game's characterization originates from archetypes.

In marketing, an archetype is a genre to a brand, based upon symbolism. The idea behind using brand archetypes in marketing is to anchor the brand against an icon already embedded within the conscience and subconscious of humanity. In the minds of both the brand owner and the public, aligning with a brand archetype makes the brand easier to identify. Twelve archetypes have been proposed for use with branding: Sage, Innocent, Explorer, Ruler, Creator, Caregiver, Magician, Hero, Outlaw, Lover, Jester, and Regular Guy/Girl.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, M., &amp; Pearson, C. S. (2001). The hero and the outlaw: Building extraordinary brands through the power of archetypes. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Jung's staunchest critics have accused him of either mystical or metaphysical [[essentialism]]. Since archetypes are defined so vaguely and since archetypal images have been observed by many Jungians in a wide and essentially infinite variety of everyday phenomena, they are neither generalizable nor specific in a way that may be researched or demarcated with any kind of rigor. Hence they elude systematic study. Jung and his supporters defended the impossibility of providing rigorous operationalised definitions as a problem peculiar not only to archetypal psychology alone, but also other domains of knowledge that seek to understand complex systems in an integrated manner.

Feminist critiques have focused on aspects of archetypal theory that are seen as being reductionistic and providing a stereotyped view of femininity and masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Toni Reed, Demon-Lovers and Their Victims in British Fiction, The University Press of Kentucky (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of archetypes is that seeing myths as universals tends to abstract them from the history of their actual creation, and their cultural context.&lt;ref name=CultStrat&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt |first=Douglas|last2=Cameron |first2=Douglas |year=2010 |title=Cultural Strategy |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-958740-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern critics state that archetypes reduce cultural expressions to generic decontextualized concepts, stripped bare of their unique cultural context, reducing a complex reality into something "simple and easy to grasp".&lt;ref name=CultStrat /&gt; Other critics respond that archetypes do nothing more than to solidify the cultural prejudices of the myths interpreter – namely modern Westerners. Modern scholarship with its emphasis on power and politics have seen archetypes as a colonial device to level the specifics of individual cultures and their stories in the service of grand abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Frank, The Constant Fire: Beyond the Science vs. Religion Debate, 1st edition, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have accused him of a romanticised and prejudicial promotion of 'primitivism' through the medium of archetypal theory. Archetypal theory has been posited as being scientifically unfalsifiable and even questioned as to being a suitable domain of psychological and scientific enquiry. Jung mentions the demarcation between experimental and descriptive psychological study, seeing archetypal psychology as rooted by necessity in the latter camp, grounded as it was (to a degree) in clinical case-work.&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. ShelburneMythos and Logos in the Thought of Carl Jung: The Theory of the Collective Unconscious in Scientific Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Jung's viewpoint was essentially subjectivist, he displayed a somewhat Neo-Kantian perspective of a skepticism for knowing things in themselves and a preference of inner experience over empirical data. This skepticism opened Jung up to the charge of countering materialism with another kind of reductionism, one that reduces everything to subjective psychological explanation and wooly quasi-mystical assertions.&lt;ref&gt;2006, English, Book, Illustrated edition:Beyond psyche : symbol and transcendence in C.G. Jung / Mark R. Gundry.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-Jungian criticism seeks to contextualise, expand and modify Jung's original discourse on archetypes. Michael Fordham is critical of tendencies to relate imagery produced by patients to historical parallels only, e.g. from alchemy, mythology or folklore. A patient who produces archetypal material with striking alchemical parallels runs the risk of becoming more divorced than before from his setting in contemporary life.&lt;ref name="Andrew Samuels 1986"/&gt;

'''Katharine Kolcaba''' (born December 28, 1944) is an American [[nurse|nursing]] [[Nursing theory|theorist]] and nursing professor. Kolcaba is responsible for the [[Kolcaba's Theory of Comfort|Theory of Comfort]], a mid-range nursing theory that has been implemented at the institutional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =March| first =A | author-link =| last2 =McCormack| first2 =D| author2-link =

==Education==
Kolcaba earned a [[Diploma in Nursing|nursing diploma]] from St. Luke's Hospital School of Nursing in 1965. She earned a [[Master of Science in Nursing]] from [[Case Western Reserve University]] in 1987 and a [[PhD]] from the same school in 1997.&lt;ref name=comfort&gt;{{cite web| title =More About Me| work =Comfort Line | url =http://www.thecomfortline.com/about/moreme.html | accessdate =July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kolcaba's nursing background included work in the operating room, medical/surgical nursing, home health and long-term care. She became interested in comfort as a theoretical construct while working on a unit for dementia patients.&lt;ref name="Sitzman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sitzman|first1=Kathleen|last2=Eichelberger|first2=Lisa Wright|title=Understanding the Work of Nurse Theorists|date=2015|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781284113112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43AlCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT114|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the concept of comfort was as old as the nursing profession, Kolcaba's theory turned it into a measurable entity with defined supporting features.&lt;ref name="Snowden"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snowden|first1=Austyn|last2=Donnell|first2=Allan|last3=Duffy|first3=Tim|title=Pioneering Theories in Nursing|date=2014|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|isbn=9781856424806|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JY6_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT79|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theory of Comfort considers the concepts of relief, ease and transcendence across four dimensions - physical, psychospiritual, sociocultural and environmental.&lt;ref name="Masters"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Masters|first1=Kathleen|title=Role Development in Professional Nursing Practice|date=2013|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449681982|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MHDezDyqTwC&amp;pg=PA73|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The juxtaposition of the three levels of comfort and four contexts of comfort is referred to as the “Taxonomic Structure of Comfort”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolcaba|first=Katharine|date=2001-03-01|title=Evolution of the mid range theory of comfort for outcomes research|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0029655401435986|journal=Nursing Outlook|language=English|volume=49|issue=2|pages=86–92|doi=10.1067/mno.2001.110268|issn=0029-6554}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the taxonomic structure as a tool allows researchers to easily apply the theory in their specialty to operationalize the idea of comfort.

Kolcaba is Associate [[Professor emeritus|Professor Emeritus]] at [[University of Akron]]. She holds an adjunct position at [[Ursuline College]].&lt;ref name=comfort/&gt;

== Scope of Theory ==
The Comfort Theory (CT) is a broad-scope middle range theory because it contains concepts and relationships, is adaptable to a wide range of practice settings and experiences, can be built from many sources and it can be tested and measured.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolcaba|first=K|date=2001|title=Evolution of mid-range theory of comfort for outcomes research|url=|journal=Nursing Outlook|volume=49 |issue=2|pages=86–92|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also qualifies as a middle range theory because of its direct applicability to nursing practice. It is broad in the sense that it also considers nursing practice holistically, however the concepts of the theory can be used separately or in combination with each other in nursing practice settings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Learning disability''' is a classification that includes several areas of functioning in which a person has difficulty learning in a typical manner, usually caused by an unknown factor or factors. Given the "difficulty learning in a typical manner", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner. Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a "learning difference", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping. In the UK, the term "learning disability" generally refers to an [[intellectual disability]], while difficulties such as [[dyslexia]] and [[dyspraxia]] are usually referred to as "learning difficulties".

While ''learning disability'', ''learning disorder'' and ''learning difficulty'' are often used interchangeably, they differ in many ways. Disorder refers to significant learning problems in an academic area. These problems, however, are not enough to warrant an official diagnosis. Learning disability, on the other hand, is an official clinical diagnosis, whereby the individual meets certain criteria, as determined by a professional (psychologist, pediatrician, etc.). The difference is in degree, frequency, and intensity of reported symptoms and problems, and thus the two should not be confused. When the term "learning disorder" is used, it describes a group of disorders characterized by inadequate development of specific academic, language, and speech skills.&lt;ref name=ChildhoodVoyagesinDevelopmentThirdEdition&gt;''Childhood Voyages in Development'', Third Edition, Thomson Wadsworth. (2008), p. 387. Retrieved 2012-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Types of learning disorders include reading (dyslexia), mathematics ([[dyscalculia]]) and writing ([[dysgraphia]]).&lt;ref name=ChildhoodVoyagesinDevelopmentThirdEdition/&gt;

The unknown factor is the disorder that affects the [[Human brain|brain]]'s ability to receive and process information. This disorder can make it problematic for a person to learn as quickly or in the same way as someone who is not affected by a learning disability. People with a learning disability have trouble performing specific types of skills or completing tasks if left to figure things out by themselves or if taught in conventional ways.

Individuals with learning disabilities can face unique challenges that are often pervasive throughout the lifespan. Depending on the type and severity of the disability, interventions, and current technologies may be used to help the individual learn strategies that will foster future success. Some interventions can be quite simplistic, while others are intricate and complex. Current technologies may require student training to be effective classroom supports. Teachers, parents, and schools can create plans together that tailor intervention and accommodations to aid the individuals in successfully becoming independent learners. School psychologists and other qualified professionals quite often help design the intervention and coordinate the execution of the intervention with teachers and parents.

==Definitions==
Representatives of organizations committed to the education and welfare of individuals with learning disabilities are known as National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities (NJCLD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities|url=http://www.ldonline.org/about/partners/njcld|website=LD Online |date=2010 |publisher=WETA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NJCLD used the term 'learning disability' to indicate a discrepancy between a child’s apparent capacity to learn and his or her level of achievement.&lt;ref&gt;1981; 1985.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several difficulties existed, however, with the NJCLD standard of defining learning disability. One such difficulty was its belief of central nervous system dysfunction as a basis of understanding and diagnosing learning disability. This conflicted with the fact that many individuals who experienced central nervous system dysfunction, such as those with cerebral palsy, did not experience disabilities in learning. On the other hand, those individuals who experienced multiple handicapping conditions along with learning disability frequently received inappropriate assessment, planning, and instruction. The NJCLD notes that it is possible for learning disability to occur simultaneously with other handicapping conditions, however, the two should not be directly linked together or confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=LD Definition |journal=Learning Disability Quarterly |volume=10 |issue=2 |date=May 1987 |pages=136–138 |doi=10.2307/1510220 |subscription=yes |jstor=1510220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1980s, NJCLD, therefore, defined the term learning disability as: &lt;blockquote&gt;a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning or mathematical abilities. These disorders are intrinsic to the individual and presumed to be due to Central Nervous System Dysfunction. Even though a learning disability may occur concomitantly with other handicapping conditions (e.g. [[sensory processing disorder|sensory impairment]], [[intellectual disability]], social and emotional disturbance) or environmental influences (e.g. cultural differences, insufficient/inappropriate instruction, [[wikt:psychogenic|psychogenic]] factors) it is not the direct result of those conditions or influences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2002 LD Roundtable produced the following definition:&lt;blockquote&gt;Concept of LD: Strong converging evidence supports the validity of the concept of specific learning disabilities (SLD). This evidence is particularly impressive because it converges across different indicators and methodologies. The central concept of SLD involves disorders of learning and cognition that are intrinsic to the individual. SLD are specific in the sense that these disorders each significantly affect a relatively narrow range of academic and performance outcomes. SLD may occur in combination with other disabling conditions, but they are not due primarily to other conditions, such as intellectual disability, behavioral disturbance, lack of opportunities to learn, or primary sensory deficits.&lt;ref name="BradleyDanielson2002"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Renée |last1=Bradley|first2=Louis C. |last2=Danielson|first3=Daniel P. |last3=Hallahan|title=Identification of learning disabilities: research to practice|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Identification_of_Learning_Disabilities.html?id=QSv7yyicod0C|accessdate=2 May 2010|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-8058-4448-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=September 2013}}&lt;ref name="urlNational Research Center on Learning Disabilities (NRCLD)"&gt;{{cite report|first1=Daniel J. |last1=Reschly |first2=John L. |last2=Hosp |first3=Catherine M. |last3=Schmied |date=20 August 2003 |title=And Miles to Go…: State SLD Requirements and Authoritative Recommendations |at=Recommendations for Change in SLD Definition and Classification Criteria |institution=National Research Center on Learning Disabilities (NRCLD) |accessdate=2010-05-01 |url=http://nrcld.org/about/research/states/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925202022/http://nrcld.org/about/research/states/index.html |archive-date=25 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The issue of defining learning disabilities has generated significant and ongoing controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reiff|first1=Henry B.|last2=Gerber|first2=Paul J.|last3=Ginsberg|first3=Rick|title=Definitions of Learning Disabilities from Adults with Learning Disabilities: The Insiders' Perspectives|journal=Learning Disability Quarterly|volume=16|issue=2|date=Spring 1993|pages=114–125|doi=10.2307/1511133|jstor=1511133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "learning disability" does not exist in [[DSM-IV]], but it has been added to the [[DSM-5]]. The [[DSM-5]] does not limit learning disorders to a particular diagnosis such as reading, mathematics, or written expression. Instead, it is a single diagnosis criterion describing drawbacks in general academic skills and includes detailed specifiers for the areas of reading, mathematics, and written expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Specific Learning Disorder |url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Specific%20Learning%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |format=PDF |website=American Psychiatric Association DSM-5 Development |date=15 May 2013 |publisher=American Psychiatric Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States and Canada===
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the terms '''learning disability''' and '''learning disorder''' (LD) refer to a group of disorders that affect a broad range of academic and functional skills including the ability to [[speech|speak]], [[Listening|listen]], [[Reading (process)|read]], [[writing|write]], [[spelling|spell]], [[reason]], organize [[information]], and do [[math]]. People with learning disabilities generally have  intelligence that is average or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Types of Learning Disabilities |url=https://ldaamerica.org/types-of-learning-disabilities/ |publisher=Learning Disabilities Association of America |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation in the United States====
The [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 1973]], effective May 1977, guarantees certain rights to people with disabilities, especially in the cases of education and work, such being in schools, colleges and university settings.{{citation needed |date=September 2016}}

The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], formerly known as the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]], is a [[United States federal law]] that governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, [[special education]] and related services to children with disabilities. It addresses the educational needs of children with disabilities from birth to the age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|20|1400}} et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Considered as a civil rights law, states are not required to participate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

====Canada====
In Canada, the first association in support of children with learning disabilities was founded in 1962 by a group of concerned parents. Originally called the Association for Children with Learning Disabilities, the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada – LDAC was created to provide awareness and services for individuals with learning disabilities, their families, at work, and the community. Since education is largely the responsibility of each province and territory in Canada, provinces and territories have jurisdiction over the education of individuals with learning disabilities, which allows the development of policies and support programs that reflect the unique multicultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic conditions of its area.&lt;ref&gt;Stegemann, K. C. (2016). Learning disabilities in Canada. Learning Disabilities: A Contemporary Journal, (1), 53. Retrieved November 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], terms such as specific learning difficulty (SpLD), [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]], [[developmental coordination disorder]] and [[dyscalculia]] are used to cover the range of learning difficulties referred to in the United States as "learning disabilities". In the UK, the term "learning disability" refers to a range of developmental disabilities or conditions that are almost invariably associated with more severe generalized [[intellectual disability|cognitive impairment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holland|first1=Ken|title=Learning Disabilities Factsheet|url=http://www.bild.org.uk/resources/factsheets/|website=bild.org.uk|publisher=British Institute of Learning Disabilities|accessdate=13 September 2017|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lancet'' defines 'learning disability' as a "significant general impairment in intellectual functioning acquired during childhood", and states that roughly one in 50 British adults have one.&lt;ref name="The Lancet, 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=&lt;!--editorial staff--&gt;|title=Demography still dictates destiny for children with disabilities|journal=Lancet |volume=386 |issue=9993 |year=2015 |pages=503 |issn= |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61459-3 |pmid=26293424 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], acknowledgement and support for students with learning disabilities has been a fairly recent development, and has improved drastically in the last{{which|date=December 2014}} decade. The first definition for learning disability was coined in 1999, and in 2001, the Enrichment Project for the Support System for Students with Learning Disabilities was established. Since then, there have been significant efforts to screen children for learning disabilities, provide follow-up support, and provide networking between schools and specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Mika |last1=Kataoka |first2=Christina E. |last2=van Kraayenoord |first3=John |last3=Elkins |title=Principals' and Teachers' Perceptions of Learning Disabilities: A Study from NARA Prefecture, Japan |journal=Learning Disability Quarterly |volume=27 |issue=3 |date=August 2004 |pages=161–175 |doi=10.2307/1593666 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

The effects of having a learning disability or learning difference are not limited to educational outcomes: individuals with learning disabilities may experience social problems as well. Neuropsychological differences can affect the accurate perception of social cues with peers.&lt;ref&gt;Rourke, B. P. (1989). Nonverbal learning disabilities: The syndrome and the model. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers argue persons with learning disabilities not only experience negative effects as a result of their learning distinctions, but also as a result of carrying a stigmatizing label. It has generally been difficult to determine the efficacy of special education services because of data and methodological limitations. Emerging research suggests adolescents with learning disabilities experience poorer academic outcomes even compared to peers who began high school with similar levels of achievement and comparable behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shifrer | first1 = Dara | last2 = Callahan | first2 = Rebecca | last3 = Muller | first3 = Chandra | year = 2013 | title = Equity or Marginalization? The High School Course-Taking of Students Labeled With a Learning Disability | url = | journal = American Educational Research Journal | volume = 50 | issue = 4| pages = 656–82 | doi=10.3102/0002831213479439| pmc = 4074008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems their poorer outcomes may be at least partially due to the lower expectations of their teachers; national data show teachers hold expectations for students labeled with learning disabilities that are inconsistent with their academic potential (as evidenced by test scores and learning behaviors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shifrer | first1 = Dara | year = 2013 | title = Stigma of a Label: Educational Expectations for High School Students Labeled with a Learning Disability | url = | journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 462–480 | doi=10.1177/0022146513503346}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that there is a strong connection between children with a learning disability and their educational performance.&lt;ref&gt;Genizi, J. (2013) Primary headaches, attention deficit disorder and learning disabilities in children and adolescents. The Journal of Headache and Pain [online]. Available at: https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1129-2377-14-54 (accessed 23/10/17)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have been done to assess the correlation between learning disability and self-esteem. These studies have shown that an individual‘s self-esteem is indeed affected by his or her awareness of their learning disability. Students with a positive perception of their academic abilities generally tend to have higher self-esteem than those who do not, regardless of their actual academic achievement. However, studies have also shown that several other factors can influence self-esteem. Skills in non-academic areas, such as athletics and arts, improve self-esteem. Also, a positive perception of one’s physical appearance has also been shown to have positive effects of self-esteem. Another important finding is that students with learning disabilities are able to distinguish between academic skill and intellectual capacity. This demonstrates that students who acknowledge their academic limitations but are also aware of their potential to succeed in other intellectual tasks see themselves as intellectually competent individuals, which increases their self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cisden | first1 = Merith | last2 = Elliot | first2 = Katherine | last3 = Noble | first3 = Sharon | last4 = Kelemen | first4 = Eve | year = 1999 | title = Self-Understanding and Self-Esteem in Children with Learning Disabilities | url = | journal = Learning Disability Quarterly | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 279–290 | doi = 10.2307/1511262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The causes for learning disabilities are not well understood, and sometimes there is no apparent cause for a learning disability. However, some causes of neurological impairments include:
; Heredity and genetics

==Diagnosis==

===IQ-achievement discrepancy===
Learning disabilities can be identified by [[psychiatrist]]s, [[school psychologist]]s, [[clinical psychologist]]s, [[counseling psychologist]]s, [[neuropsychologist]]s and other learning disability specialists through a combination of [[intelligence test]]ing, academic achievement testing, classroom performance, and social interaction and aptitude. Other areas of assessment may include perception, cognition, memory, attention, and language abilities. The resulting information is used to determine whether a child's academic performance is commensurate with his or her cognitive ability. If a child's cognitive ability is much higher than his or her academic performance, the student is often diagnosed with a learning disability. The DSM-IV and many school systems and government programs diagnose learning disabilities in this way (DSM-IV uses the term "disorder" rather than "disability").

Although the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years, there has been substantial criticism of this approach among researchers.&lt;ref name=Aaron1995&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aaron, P.G. | year = 1995 | title = Differential Diagnosis of Reading Disabilities | journal = School Psychology Review | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 345–60 | issn = 0279-6015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Patti L. Harrison |author2=Flanagan, Dawn P. |title=Contemporary intellectual assessment: theories, tests, and issues |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-59385-125-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has provided little evidence that a discrepancy between formally measured IQ and achievement is a clear indicator of LD.&lt;ref name =Fletcher&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marcia A. Barnes |author2=Fletcher, Jack |author3=Fuchs, Lynn |title=Learning Disabilities: From Identification to Intervention |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=1-59385-370-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, diagnosing on the basis of a discrepancy does not predict the effectiveness of treatment. Low academic achievers who do not have a discrepancy with IQ (i.e. their IQ scores are also low) appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who do have a discrepancy with IQ (i.e. their IQ scores are higher than their academic performance would suggest).

===Response to intervention===
Much current research has focused on a treatment-oriented [[diagnostic]] process known as [[response to intervention]] (RTI). Researcher recommendations for implementing such a model include early screening for all students, placing those students who are having difficulty into research-based early intervention programs, rather than waiting until they meet diagnostic criteria. Their performance can be closely monitored to determine whether increasingly intense intervention results in adequate progress.&lt;ref name =Fletcher/&gt; Those who respond will not require further intervention. Those who do not respond adequately to regular classroom instruction (often called "Tier 1 instruction") and a more intensive intervention (often called "Tier 2" intervention) are considered "non-responders." These students can then be referred for further assistance through special education, in which case they are often identified with a learning disability. Some models of RTI include a third tier of intervention before a child is identified as having a learning disability.

A primary benefit of such a model is that it would not be necessary to wait for a child to be sufficiently far behind to qualify for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Finn | first = C.E.,  Rotherham A.J. &amp; Hokanson C.R. | year = 2001 | title = Rethinking Special Education For A New Century | publisher = Progressive Policy Institute | url= http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=110&amp;subsecID=900030&amp;contentID=3344  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may enable more children to receive assistance before experiencing significant failure, which may, in turn, result in fewer children who need intensive and expensive special education services. In the United States, the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act permitted states and school districts to use RTI as a method of identifying students with learning disabilities. RTI is now the primary means of identification of learning disabilities in Florida.

The process does not take into account children's individual neuropsychological factors such as phonological awareness and memory, that can inform design instruction. By not taking into account specific cognitive processes, RTI fails to inform educators about a students' relative strengths and weaknesses&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher-Janzen, Reynolds. (2008). Neuropsychological Perspectives on Learning Disabilities in the Era of RTI: Recommendations for Diagnosis and Intervention&lt;/ref&gt; Second, RTI by design takes considerably longer than established techniques, often many months to find an appropriate tier of intervention. Third, it requires a strong intervention program before students can be identified with a learning disability. Lastly, RTI is considered a regular education initiative and is not driven by psychologists, reading specialists, or special educators.

===Latino English language learners===

Demographers in the United State report that there has been a significant increase in immigrant children in the United States over the past two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Child Trends, 2014.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information is vital because it has been and will continue to affect both students and how educators approach teaching methods. Various teaching strategies are more successful for students that are linguistic or culturally diverse versus traditional methods of teaching used for students whose first language is English. It is then also true that the proper way to diagnose a learning disability in English language learners (ELL) differs. In the United States, there has been a growing need to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to provide effective school psychological services, specifically for those professionals who work with immigrant populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruiz |first1=Melissa |last2=Kabler |first2=Brenda |last3=Sugarman |first3=Melissa |date=January 2011 |title=Understanding the plight of immigrant and refugee students |journal=Communiqué |volume=39 |issue=5 |publisher=National Association of School Psychologists |url=http://www.nasponline.org/publications/periodicals/communique/issues/volume-39-issue-5/multicultural-affairs-understanding-the-plight-of-immigrant-and-refugee-students }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are no standardized guidelines for the process of diagnosing English language learners (ELL) with specific learning disabilities (SLD). This is a problem since many students will fall through the cracks as educators are unable to clearly assess if a student’s delay is due to a language barrier or true learning disability. With an unclear diagnosis, many students will suffer because they will not be provided with the tools they need to succeed in the public education school system. For example, in many occasions teachers have suggested retention or have taken no action at all when they lack experience working with English language learners. Students were commonly pushed toward testing, based on an assumption that their poor academic performance or behavioral difficulties indicated a need for special education.&lt;ref name=Klinger2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klingner |first1=Janette K. |last2=Harry |first2=Beth |date=2006 |title=The special education referral and decision-making process for English language learners: Child study team meetings and placement conferences |journal=Teachers College Record |volume=108 |issue=11 |pages=2247–2281 |url=http://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentId=12804 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9620.2006.00781.x |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically responsive psychologist understand that second language acquisition is a process and they understand how to support ELLs' growth in language and academically.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez et al., 2014.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ELLs are referred for a psychoeducational assessment, it is difficult to isolate and disentangle what are the effects of the language acquisition process, from poor quality educational services, from what may be academic difficulties that result from processing disorders, attention problems, and learning disabilities.&lt;ref name=Klinger2006/&gt; Additionally not having trained staff and faculty becomes more of an issue when staff is unaware of numerous types of psychological factors that immigrant children in the U.S dealing could be potentially dealing with. These factors that include acculturation, fear and/or worry of deportation, separation from social supports such as parents, language barriers, disruptions in learning experiences, stigmatization, economic challenge, and risk factors associated with poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 2009; Martines, 2008; Rhodes.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ochoa2005&gt;Ochoa, &amp; Ortiz, 2005.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, there are no set policies mandating that all districts employ bilingual school psychologist, nor are schools equipped with specific tools and resources to assist immigrant children and families. Many school districts do not have the proper personnel that is able to communicate with this population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frisby |first=Craig L. |date=2013 |title=Meeting the psychoeducational needs of minority students: Evidence-based guidelines for school psychologists and other school personnel |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=Wiley and Sons |doi=10.1002/9781118092620 |isbn=978-1-118-09262-0 |oclc=822560271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}}

===Spanish-speaking ELL===

A well trained bilingual school psychologist will be able to administer and interpret assessment all psychological testing tool. Also, an emphasis is placed on informal assessment measures such as language samples, observations, interviews, and rating scales as well as curriculum-based measurement to complement information gathered from formal assessments.&lt;ref name=Ochoa2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geva, E., &amp; Wiener, J. (2015). Psychological assessment of culturally and linguistically diverse children and adolescents: A practitioner’s guide. New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; A compilation of these tests is used to assess whether an ELL student has a learning disability or merely is academically delayed because of language barriers or environmental factors. It is very unfortunate that many schools do not have school psychologist with the proper training nor access to appropriate tools. Also, many school districts frown upon taking the appropriate steps to diagnosing ELL students.

===Assessment===
Many normed assessments can be used in evaluating skills in the primary academic domains: reading, including word recognition, fluency, and comprehension; mathematics, including computation and problem solving; and written expression, including handwriting, spelling and composition.

The most commonly used comprehensive achievement tests include the Woodcock-Johnson IV (WJ IV), Wechsler Individual Achievement Test II (WIAT II), the Wide Range Achievement Test III (WRAT III), and the Stanford Achievement Test–10th edition. These tests include measures of many academic domains that are reliable in identifying areas of difficulty.&lt;ref name = Fletcher/&gt;

In the reading domain, there are also specialized tests that can be used to obtain details about specific reading deficits. Assessments that measure multiple domains of reading include Gray's Diagnostic Reading Tests–2nd edition (GDRT II) and the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Assessment. Assessments that measure reading subskills include the Gray Oral Reading Test IV&amp;nbsp;– Fourth Edition (GORT IV), Gray Silent Reading Test, Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP), Tests of Oral Reading and Comprehension Skills (TORCS), Test of Reading Comprehension 3 (TORC-3), Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE), and the Test of Reading Fluency. A more comprehensive list of reading assessments may be obtained from the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL), 2007.[http://www.sedl.org/reading/rad/chart.html Southwest Educational Development Laboratory] Accessed September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of assessment is to determine what is needed for intervention, which also requires consideration of contextual variables and whether there are comorbid disorders that must also be identified and treated, such as behavioral issues or language delays.&lt;ref name = Fletcher/&gt; These contextual variables are often assessed using parent and teacher questionnaire forms that rate the students' behaviors and compares them to standardized norms.

However, caution should be made when suspecting the person with a learning disability may also have dementia, especially as people with Down's syndrome may have the neuroanatomical profile but not the associated clinical signs and symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, S.B.N. "Dementia and memory: a guide for students and health professionals." Aldershot: Ashgate 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Examination can be carried out of executive functioning as well as social and cognitive abilities but may need adaptation of standardized tests to take account of special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = S.B.N. | year = 2000 | title = The Central Executive System in people with Down's syndrome and dementia | url = | journal = Clinical Gerontologist | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 3–32 | doi=10.1300/j018v21n03_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = S.B.N. | year = 2000 | title = Investigation into Down's syndrome and dementia | url = | journal = Journal of the Association of Practitioners in Learning Disability | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 10–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = S.B.N. | year = 1999 | title = Examining dementia in Down's syndrome (DS): decline in social abilities in DS compared with other learning disabilities | url = | journal = Clinical Gerontologist | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 23–44 | doi=10.1300/j018v20n03_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = S.B.N. | year = 1999 | title = Assessing dementia in people with learning disabilities for cognitive rehabilitation | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Rehabilitation | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 14–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Learning disabilities can be categorized by either the type of information processing affected by the disability or by the specific difficulties caused by a processing deficit.

===By stage of information processing===
Learning disabilities fall into broad categories based on the four stages of information processing used in learning: input, integration, storage, and output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading and Learning Disabilities |website=National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities (NICHY) |publisher=Academy for Educational Development (AED) |date=2004 |url=http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs17txt.htm |access-date=11 May 2007 |archive-date=23 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523213649/http://www.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs17txt.htm |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many learning disabilities are a compilation of a few types of abnormalities occurring at the same time, as well as with social difficulties and emotional or behavioral disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. Reid |last=Lyon |title=Learning Disabilities |journal=The Future of Children |date=1996 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=54–76 |jstor=1602494 |doi=10.2307/1602494 |pmid=8689262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
; Input
: This is the information perceived through the senses, such as visual and auditory perception. Difficulties with visual perception can cause problems with recognizing the shape, position, or size of items seen. There can be problems with [[Sequence learning|sequencing]], which can relate to deficits with processing time intervals or temporal perception. Difficulties with auditory perception can make it difficult to screen out competing sounds in order to focus on one of them, such as the sound of the teacher's voice in a classroom setting. Some children appear to be unable to process tactile input. For example, they may seem insensitive to pain or dislike being touched.
; Integration
: This is the stage during which perceived input is interpreted, categorized, placed in a sequence, or related to previous learning. Students with problems in these areas may be unable to tell a story in the correct sequence, unable to memorize sequences of information such as the days of the week, able to understand a new concept but be unable to generalize it to other areas of learning, or able to learn facts but be unable to put the facts together to see the "big picture." A poor vocabulary may contribute to problems with comprehension.
; Storage
: Problems with memory can occur with short-term or working memory, or with long-term memory. Most memory difficulties occur with one's short-term memory, which can make it difficult to learn new material without more repetitions than usual. Difficulties with visual memory can impede learning to spell.
; Output
: Information comes out of the brain either through words, that is, language output, or through muscle activity, such as gesturing, writing or drawing. Difficulties with language output can create problems with spoken language. Such difficulties include answering a question on demand, in which one must retrieve information from storage, organize our thoughts, and put the thoughts into words before we speak. It can also cause trouble with written language for the same reasons. Difficulties with motor abilities can cause problems with gross and fine motor skills. People with gross motor difficulties may be clumsy, that is, they may be prone to stumbling, falling, or bumping into things. They may also have trouble running, climbing, or learning to ride a bicycle. People with fine motor difficulties may have trouble with handwriting, buttoning shirts, or tying shoelaces.

===By function impaired===
Deficits in any area of information processing can manifest in a variety of specific learning disabilities. It is possible for an individual to have more than one of these difficulties. This is referred to as comorbidity or co-occurrence of learning disabilities.&lt;ref name="titleAmanda Kirby speaking to dysTalk on The Co-occurrence of learning difficulties"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/57-co-occurrence-of-learning-difficulties |title=Amanda Kirby speaking on the co-occurrence of learning difficulties |publisher=dysTalk |accessdate=2009-04-22 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the term ''[[dual diagnosis]]'' is often used to refer to co-occurrence of learning difficulties.

====Reading disorder (ICD-10 and DSM-IV codes: F81.0/315.00)====
Reading disorder is the most common learning disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Learning disabilities, dyslexia, and vision.  |vauthors=Handler SM, etal | journal=Pediatrics|date=March 2011 | volume=127 | issue=3 | pages=e818–56 | doi=10.1542/peds.2010-3670 | pmid=21357342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all students with specific learning disabilities, 70–80% have deficits in reading. The term "[[dyslexia|Developmental Dyslexia]]" is often used as a synonym for reading disability; however, many researchers assert that there are different types of reading disabilities, of which dyslexia is one. A reading disability can affect any part of the reading process, including difficulty with accurate or fluent word recognition, or both, word decoding, reading rate, prosody (oral reading with expression), and reading comprehension. Before the term "dyslexia" came to prominence, this learning disability used to be known as "word blindness."

Common indicators of reading disability include difficulty with phonemic awareness—the ability to break up words into their component sounds, and difficulty with matching letter combinations to specific sounds (sound-symbol correspondence).

====Disorder of written expression (ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR codes 315.2)====

{{further|Disorder of written expression}}

The DSM-IV-TR criteria for a '''disorder of written expression''' is writing skills (as measured by a standardized test or functional assessment) that fall substantially below those expected based on the individual's chronological age, measured intelligence, and age-appropriate education, (Criterion A). This difficulty must also cause significant impairment to academic achievement and tasks that require composition of written text (Criterion B), and if a sensory deficit is present, the difficulties with writing skills must exceed those typically associated with the sensory deficit, (Criterion C).&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text revision). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with a diagnosis of a disorder of written expression typically have a combination of difficulties in their abilities with written expression as evidenced by grammatical and punctuation errors within sentences, poor paragraph organization, multiple spelling errors, and excessively poor penmanship. A disorder in spelling or handwriting without other difficulties of written expression do not generally qualify for this diagnosis. If poor handwriting is due to an impairment in the individuals' motor coordination, a diagnosis of [[developmental coordination disorder]] should be considered.

By a number of organizations, the term "[[dysgraphia]]" has been used as an overarching term for all disorders of written expression.

====Math disability (ICD-10 and DSM-IV codes F81.2-3/315.1)====

{{further|Dyscalculia}}

Sometimes called [[dyscalculia]], a math disability involves difficulties such as learning math concepts (such as quantity, place value, and time), difficulty memorizing math facts, difficulty organizing numbers, and understanding how problems are organized on the page. Dyscalculics are often referred to as having poor "number sense".&lt;ref name="titleDyscalculia expert Jane Emerson explains number sense and its relevance to dyscalculia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/32-what-is-dyscalculia |title=Dyscalculia expert Jane Emerson explains number sense and its relevance to dyscalculia|publisher=dystalk.com |accessdate=2009-04-23 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non ICD-10/DSM====
* [[Nonverbal learning disability]]: Nonverbal learning disabilities often manifest in motor clumsiness, poor visual-spatial skills, problematic social relationships, difficulty with mathematics, and poor organizational skills. These individuals often have specific strengths in the verbal domains, including early speech, large vocabulary, early reading and spelling skills, excellent rote memory and auditory retention, and eloquent self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lerner, Janet W. |title=Learning disabilities: theories, diagnosis, and teaching strategies |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-395-96114-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disorders of speaking and listening: Difficulties that often co-occur with learning disabilities include difficulty with memory, social skills and [[executive functions]] (such as organizational skills and time management).

Reading, MA: Perseus Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses, and places undue emphasis on academic success by insisting that people should receive additional support in this arena but not in music or sports. Other research has pinpointed the use of resource rooms as an important—yet often politicized component of educating students with learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Learning Disabilities'', Dec 1973; vol. 6: pp. 609 - 614&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
===School laws===

Schools in the United States have a legal obligation to new arrivals to the country, including undocumented students. The landmark Supreme Court ruling [[Plyler v. Doe]] (1982) grants all children, no matter their legal status, the right to a free education.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, 2014.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Plyler v. Doe |vol=457 |reporter= |opinion=202 |pinpoint= |court=U.S. |date=1982 |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling suggests that as a country we acknowledge that we have a population of students with specific needs that differ from those of native speakers. Additionally specifically in regards to ELL's the supreme court ruling [[Lau v. Nichols]] (1974) stated that equal treatment in school did not mean equal educational opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Lau v. Nichols |volume=414 |court=U.S. |opinion=563 |date=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if a school teaches a lesson in a language that students do not understand then they are effectively worthless.This ruling is also supported by English language development services provided in schools, but unfortunately, these rulings do not require the individuals that teach and provide services to have any specific training nor is licensing different from a typical teacher or services provider.

===Critique of the medical model===

===Culture===
There are three patterns that are well known in regards to mainstream students and minority labels in the United States:
* "A higher percentage of minority children than of white children are assigned to special education";
* "within special education, white children are assigned to less restrictive programs than are their minority counterparts";
* "the data&amp;nbsp;— driven by inconsistent methods of diagnosis, treatment, and funding&amp;nbsp;— make the overall system difficult to describe or change”.&lt;ref name = McD&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McDermott | first1 = R. | last2 = Goldman | first2 = S. | last3 = Varenne | first3 = H. | year = 2006 | title = The cultural work of learning disabilities | url = | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 12–17 | doi=10.3102/0013189x035006012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the present day, it has been reported that white districts have more children from minority backgrounds enrolled in special education than they do majority students. “It was also suggested that districts with a higher percentage of minority faculty had fewer minority students placed in special education suggesting that 'minority students are treated differently in predominantly white districts than in predominantly minority districts'".&lt;ref name = Fletcher2003&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fletcher | first1 = T.V. | last2 = Navarrete | first2 = L.A. | year = 2003 | title = Learning disabilities or difference: A critical look at issues associated with misidentification and placement of Hispanic students in special education programs | url = | journal = Classics RESQ Article | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 30–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators have only recently started to look into the effects of culture on learning disabilities.&lt;ref name = Artiles&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Artiles | first1 = A.J. | last2 = Thorious | first2 = K.K. | last3 = Bap | first3 = A. | last4 = Neal | first4 = R. | last5 = Waitoller | first5 = F.R. | last6 = Hernandez-Saca | first6 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Beyond culture as group traits: Future learning disabilities ontology, epistemology, and inquire on research knowledge use | url = http://ldq.sagepub.com/content/34/3/167.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Learning Disability Quarterly | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 167–179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a teacher ignores a student’s culturally diverse background, the student will suffer in the class. “The cultural repertoires of students from cultural learning disorder backgrounds have an impact on their learning, school progress, and behavior in the classroom”.&lt;ref name = Utley&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Utley | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Obiakor | first2 = F.E. | last3 = Bakken | first3 = J.P. | year = 2011 | title = Culturally responsive practices for culturally and linguistically diverse students with learning disabiltiies | url = | journal = Learning Disabilities: A Contemporary Journal | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 5–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These students may then act out and not excel in the classroom and will, therefore, be misdiagnosed: “Overall, the data indicates that there is a persistent concern regarding the misdiagnosis and inappropriate placement of students from diverse backgrounds in special education classes since the 1975”.&lt;ref name = Fletcher /&gt;

===Social roots of learning disabilities in the U.S.===
One of the clearest indications of the social roots of learning disabilities is the disproportionate identification of racial and ethnic minorities and students who have low [[socioeconomic status]] (SES). While some attribute the disproportionate identification of racial/ethnic minorities to racist practices or cultural misunderstanding,&lt;ref name="Patton1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patton|first1=J. M.|title=The Disproportionate Representation of African Americans in Special Education: Looking Behind the Curtain for Understanding and Solutions|journal=The Journal of Special Education|volume=32 |issue=1 |year=1998 |pages=25–31|issn=0022-4669|doi=10.1177/002246699803200104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reid, Knight, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reid|first1=D.

While many studies have considered only one characteristic of the student at a time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Haveman, Robert |author2=Sandefur, Gary |author3=Wolfe,  Barbara |author4=Voyer, Andrea |chapter=Trends in children's attainments and their determinants as family income inequality has increased |editors=Neckerman, Kathryn M. |title=Social inequality |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation |location=New York |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-87154-620-5 |oclc=53903734 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or used district- or school-level data to examine this issue, more recent studies have used large national student-level datasets and sophisticated methodology to find that the disproportionate identification of African American students with learning disabilities can be attributed to their average lower SES, while the disproportionate identification of Latino youth seems to be attributable to difficulties in distinguishing between linguistic proficiency and learning ability.&lt;ref name="Shifrer, Muller, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shifrer |first1=Dara |title=Disability as a Fluid State |last2=Muller|first2=Chandra |last3=Callahan |first3=Rebecca |volume=5 |year=2010 |pages=279–308|issn=1479-3547|doi=10.1108/S1479-3547(2010)0000005014 |url=http://www.prc.utexas.edu/etag/23rd%20Floor%20Publications/Shifrer,%20Dara/Shifrer%20et%20al.%202010-Disproportionality.pdf |accessdate=2011-06-17|chapter=Disproportionality: A sociological perspective of the identification by schools of students with learning disabilities |series=Research in Social Science and Disability |isbn=978-0-85724-377-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shifrer, Callahan, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shifrer |first1=D.|last2=Muller |first2=C.|last3=Callahan |first3=R.|title=Disproportionality and Learning Disabilities: Parsing Apart Race, Socioeconomic Status, and Language|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities |volume=44|issue=3 |year=2010 |pages=246–257 |issn=0022-2194 |doi=10.1177/0022219410374236 |url=http://www.prc.utexas.edu/etag/23rd%20Floor%20Publications/Shifrer,%20Dara/Shifrer%20et%20al.%202010-Disproportionality&amp;Disability.pdf|pmc=4133990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the contributing factors are complicated and interrelated, it is possible to discern which factors really drive disproportionate identification by considering a multitude of student characteristics simultaneously. For instance, if high SES minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among high SES Whites, and low SES minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among low SES Whites, we can know that the seemingly higher rates of identification among minorities result from their greater likelihood to have low SES. Summarily, because the risk of identification for White students who have low SES is similar to that of Black students who have low SES, future research and policy reform should focus on identifying the shared qualities or experiences of low SES youth that lead to their disproportionate identification, rather than focusing exclusively on racial/ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Shifrer, Muller, 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shifrer, Callahan, 2010"/&gt; It remains to be determined why lower SES youth are at higher risk of incidence, or possibly just of identification, with learning disabilities.

==Contrast with other conditions==
People with an [[IQ]] lower than 70 are usually characterized as having an [[intellectual disability]] and are not included under most definitions of learning disabilities because their difficulty in learning are considered to be related directly to their overall low intelligence.

[[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) is often studied in connection with learning disabilities, but it is not actually included in the standard definitions of learning disabilities. An individual with ADHD may struggle with learning, but he or she can often learn adequately once successfully treated for the ADHD. A person can have ADHD but not learning disabilities or have learning disabilities without having ADHD. The conditions can co-occur.

People diagnosed with ADHD sometimes have impaired learning. Some of the struggles people with ADHD have might include lack of motivation, high levels of [[anxiety]], and the inability to process information.&lt;ref name="Reaser, A. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reaser | first1 = A. | last2 = Prevatt | first2 = F. | last3 = Petscher | first3 = Y. | last4 = Proctor | first4 = B. | year = 2007 | title = The learning and study strategies of college students with ADHD | url = | journal = Psychology in the Schools | volume = 44 | issue = 6| pages = 627–638 | doi = 10.1002/pits.20252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are studies that suggest people with ADHD generally have a positive attitude toward academics and, with developed study skills, can perform just as well as individuals without learning disabilities. Also, using alternate sources of gathering information, such as websites, study groups, and learning centers, can help a person with ADHD be academically successful.&lt;ref name="Reaser, A. 2007"/&gt;

Some research is beginning to make a case for ADHD being included in the definition of LDs since it is being shown to have a strong effect on "executive functions" required for learning. This has not as yet affected any official definitions. Though, historically, ADHD was not clearly distinguished from other disabilities related to learning.{{citation needed |date=September 2016}} Scientific research continues to explore the traits, struggles, and learning styles of those with ADHD.

==Game Development==
Media Design School is the only tertiary institute in New Zealand where students can develop for [[Playstation]] platforms with console [[Software development kit|development kits]], due to an exclusive partnership with [[Sony Computer Entertainment Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediadesign.school.nz/developmentkits ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420190120/http://www.mediadesign.school.nz/developmentkits |date=April 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates have gone on to work at a variety of game development studios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mediadesignschool.com/about/success-stories |title=Alumni &amp;#124; Media Design School New Zealand |publisher=Mediadesignschool.com |date=2016-08-27 |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[PikPok]], [[Bohemia Interactive]], [[Grinding Gear Games]], [[Gameloft]], [[EA Digital Illusions CE]], [[RocketWerkz]] and [[CerebralFix]]. [[Ninja Kiwi]], who developed the popular [[Bloons TD|Bloons Tower Defense]] game, was also founded by a graduate of the game development course.

The joint game development department also runs an annual national initiative called Girls in Games, focused on providing experience in programming and game art for high-school aged female students based in the North Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mediadesignschool.com/blog/girls-in-games-2016 |title=Girls in Games 2016 &amp;#124; Media Design School New Zealand |publisher=Mediadesignschool.com |date=2016-08-27 |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mishti Sharma''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', played by Scarlet Vas. She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 18 April 2017. The character was introduced alongside an extended branch of the show's long-standing Rebecchi family, who consist of Indian-Australians. The show's producer [[Jason Herbison]] thought their inclusion was important to better reflect Australian society. Actress Sharon Johal who plays Mishti's sister [[Dipi Rebecchi]] originally auditioned for the role of Mishti. When writers changed the characters age they hired Vas to play her instead. Vas made her final appearance as Mishti on 19 October 2018.

Mishti is characterised as having a strong passion for physical fitness and is family oriented. She often plays the role of peacemaker in her family when they argue. Vas has described Mishti as a "harsh" character who is "righteous about staying within the law." When Mishti arrives in [[Erinsborough]] she is keen to start a new life, suggesting she has a troubled past. She forms a business partnership with [[Aaron Brennan]] (Matt Wilson) and opens a gym called The Shed. But viewers soon learn that Mishti is an ex-police officer who left the force following the death of her boyfriend Zander. Mishti's storylines have mainly focused on her relationship with [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano) and their many dramas. She also features in a pregnancy and miscarriage story. The character returns to the police force and begins investigating her neighbours who she believes are embroiled in the murder of [[Hamish Roche]] (Sean Taylor). Reaction to Mishti has been positive and Claire Crick from ''[[Soaplife]]'' branded her and Leo a "power couple".

==Casting==
The character and casting details were announced on 27 March.&lt;ref name="NewFamily"/&gt; Mishti is [[Dipi Rebecchi]]'s (Sharon Johal) sister. She arrives in [[Erinsborough]] with Dipi's husband [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan), an extended branch of the show's long-standing Rebecchi family.&lt;ref name="NewFamily"/&gt; The new Rebecchis are an Indian-Australian family. The show's producer [[Jason Herbison]] stated that "we felt it was important that our new extended Rebecchi family reflect the cultural diversity of the community and our audience."&lt;ref name=tvtonight/&gt; Network Ten's Head of Drama, Rick Maier added that "the new Rebecchi clan make for a very welcome addition to the neighbourhood, bringing fun, warmth and intrigue."&lt;ref name=tvtonight&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knox|first1=David|title=Neighbours casting for diversity|url=https://tvtonight.com.au/2017/03/neighbours-casting-for-diversity.html|website=[[TV Tonight]]|accessdate=28 March 2018|date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vas was given the part a couple of days after she graduated from university, which she stated "was a dream come true".&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Vas found her first day on-set "nerve-wracking" but quickly settled into the role.&lt;ref name=wotint/&gt; Johal initially auditioned for the role after she received a call from the casting team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grewal|first1=Preetinder|title=Punjabi actress Sharon Johal hits Australia's small screen on Neighbours|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/yourlanguage/punjabi/en/article/2017/05/17/punjabi-actress-sharon-johal-hits-australias-small-screen-neighbours|website=[[Sbs.com.au]]|accessdate=28 March 2018|date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mishti was originally supposed to be older, but casting directors decided to look for a younger actress following changes to the character's age. Producers still liked Johal's work and cast her as the much older Dipi instead.&lt;ref name=johalinterview&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sharon Johal Neighbours' Dipi Rebecchi ...faces your questions!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=7-13 October 2017|issue=40|pages=46–47|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mishti made her first appearance on 18 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=15–21 April 2017|title=Soap diary|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=([[Bauer Media Group]])|issue=15|quote=A traveller called Mishti is a welcome distraction for Leo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But she often appears sad because of her past experiences which are initially kept secret from viewers.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Mishti is very family oriented and close to her sister Dipi. She has a history of being in the police force and therefore is keen to uphold the law.&lt;ref name=wotint/&gt; Vas has described Mishti as a "harsh" character who is "righteous about staying within the law." She is also "kind, warm-hearted and sweet" despite her career. Vas also believes Mishti "certainly knows what she wants and how to get it."&lt;ref name=wotint/&gt;

Vas has said that Mishti's "smarts are like her super powers, she's very savvy." She uses this in her approach to solving crimes. She behaves in a very moral and righteous manner.&lt;ref name=characterisation/&gt; Vas said that when another character tries to bribe Mishti, it is a mistake because she is "Mrs Morals". In her approach to police work Mishti has proven to be a nosey neighbour. She wants to solve all the crimes in the show.

===Introduction===
Mishti arrives in Erinsborough to see her brother-in-law Shane. Coghlan, who plays Shane has explained that Mishti helps him when he considers moving to the area. The actor also described Mishti as "a dear friend" to Shane and said the two characters "share some pretty serious confidences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|date=15–21 April 2017|title=Meet Toadie's big brother!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=15|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mishti comes to Erinsborough wanting a fresh start. However, Daniel Kilkelly of [[Digital Spy]] thought she had a dark secret, noting "there's also an air of sadness about her."&lt;ref name="NewFamily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/news/a824471/neighbours-shane-rebecchi-returns-new-family/|title=Neighbours unveils a brand new family as Toadie Rebecchi's brother Shane returns|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=27 March 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Mishti's early roles in her family's story was trying to unite the bickering clan.

Mishti then decides to set-up a business in Erinsborough. She asks fellow fitness enthusiast [[Aaron Brennan]] (Matt Wilson) to be her business partner in running a gym. He is hesitant but Mishti goes ahead and buys The Shed. Aaron later agrees to Mishti's plan and they open for business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Justin|title=Aaron and Mishti strike a deal!|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/neighbours/neighbours-pictures/neighbours-mishti-aaron-business-479707/|website=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[Time Inc.

She has to figure out what she can get out of the partnership.&lt;ref name=insidesoapint/&gt; The pair eventually bond and become good friends whilst training together. Vas explained that Mishti is "obsessed with fitness" and Aaron's equal passion for it brings them together. Vas was happy with the on-screen friendship because it is "cute".&lt;ref name=insidesoapint&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mishti means business!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=8-14 July 2017|issue=27|pages=34|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was also happy with the pairing because it offered his character stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart exclusive: Neighbours Heartthrob Matt Wilson Gives Us The Goss On #Daaron's Tragic Love Life|url=http://www.heart.co.uk/showbiz/tv-movies/daytime-tv/heart-exclusive-neighbours-heartthrob-matt-wilson/|website=[[Heart (radio network)|Heart]]|accessdate=28 March 2018|date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another storyline Mishti returns to working as a police officer. When Shane gets drunk and starts threatening [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]) and vandalising his garden, she is forced to arrest him. Vas told an ''Inside Soap'' reporter that "if Mishti didn't do her job properly it would be very obvious to her superiors." Dipi is angry with Mishti who believes she should have protected her family. But Vas explained that Mishti's role in the Erinsborough is to protect the public and Shane was being drunk and disorderly in public. The actress added that it is a moment when "she is a cop, not a sister."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mishti arrests Shane!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=13-19 January 2018|issue=1|pages=24|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mishti's early month's on-screen it became clear that she was hiding a secret. Mishti does begin to reveal certain aspects of her past to [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano). Vas told Alison James from ''[[Soaplife]]'' that she begins to confide in him after he earns her trust.&lt;ref name=wotint/&gt; Later Mishti and Shane discuss her secret in private which gives the impression they are having an affair. Vas explained that "whatever Mishti’s secret is, it’s complicated and it has the potential to cause problems within the family." She added that Mishti definitely wants Shane to keep her secret from other characters in the show. In addition ''Neighbours'' wanted to keep viewers guessing at what her secret could be.&lt;ref name=wotint&gt;{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=Alison|title=Mishti mystery revealed?|journal=[[Soaplife]]|date=20 May - 2 June 2017|issue=407|pages=40|publisher=([[Time Inc.

===Relationship with Leo Tanaka===

Initially their bond takes a while to form. After befriending each other  Mishti's reluctance to discuss her past causes problems. Vas told James from ''Soaplife'' that "Mishti starts dropping her guard and she begins to confide in him."&lt;ref name=wotint/&gt; Leo, a character who had previously been portrayed as ruthless, began showing a caring side towards Mishti. Writers would continue to have the duo stuck contemplating a relationship but ultimately remain friends.&lt;ref name=tenplayfeature/&gt; Producers finally decided to unite the pair in September 2017. When Amy wants Leo to sell his share of the Robinsons hotel she concocts a plan to get him and Mishti together. She assumes that Mishti will be able to convince Leo to sell. Mishti is unaware of Amy's true intentions and thinks she is matchmaking. Leo is furious when he finds out Amy's deceit and presumes Mishti is part of the scam.

More problems followed focusing on the issue of trust. Mishti becomes secretive over her rogue investigation into the death of [[Hamish Roche]] (Sean Taylor). She lies about her whereabouts. But Mishti installed a tracking app on his telephone device, as a kind gesture to follow each other. Leo uses the app to track down Mishti and discovers she is lying.

===Dilhan Ozdil feud===
Writers planned a [[revenge porn]] story for Mishti which began in June 2018.

==Storylines==
Mishti comes to Harold's Café in Erinsborough to talk to Shane Rebecchi about whether his brother [[Toadfish Rebecchi]] ([[Ryan Moloney]]) can help them. Mishti then tells Shane that she might have found a way to solve their problem. Shane later tells Mishti that he is thinking of moving to Erinsborough, as he and his wife Dipi need a fresh start. She asks Shane if he has told Toadie everything, but he says he is planning to. Mishti stays at the Erinsborough Backpackers and flirts with Leo. They agree that neither of them want a serious relationship. Mishti surprises Dipi when she and her daughters finally arrive in Erinsborough. Mishti helps an injured [[Piper Willis]] (Mavournee Hazel) when a ute crashes into the backpackers hostel. She continues to stay involved in the investigation and drives Tyler to the city, so he can question [[T-Bone (Neighbours)|T-Bone]] (Des Flanagan). When Tyler assaults T-Bone, Mishti reports him to the police and it emerges that she is a former police officer. Shane admits to Dipi that Mishti gave him a loan, as he lost a lot of money trying to get his solar-powered lawnmower to work. Mishti also reveals that she followed Shane to Erinsborough to help out and get away from her old life.

Mishti befriends Aaron and they buy a local gym together. While arguing with Leo, Mishti gets into her car and reverses into Tyler. She briefly goes into shock, while Tyler is left with severe bruising. Mishti reveals to Leo that she was once engaged to a fellow police officer named Zander, who was run down and killed during an [[Random breath test|RBT]] patrol, and the driver responsible escaped justice. Shane later tells Dipi that shortly after Zander's death, he found Mishti smashing up the house and threatening to get justice for Zander. He stopped her from leaving with her service weapon, and she decided to quit the force. Mishti tells Dipi that the accident with Tyler reminded her of Zander. She starts a relationship with Leo. She finds Leo with Courtney and suspects he was cheating on her and runs off. Leo finds her and assures her that he was only trying to find out if Courtney was truly committed to her relationship with his dad, Paul. She is suspicious in the whereabouts of Gary and his mother [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) on the night of Hamish's death and investigates. Impressing the sergeant she is then offered to return to a job in the police force and accepts. Mishti tells Aaron that she will no longer be working with him at The Shed. Mishti investigates Paul's interference with hotel records, but is ordered to stop. She arrests Shane following a drunken public disturbance on Ramsay Street and puts him in a cell to sober up. Dipi is angry with Mishti arresting her own family, but she later forgives her sister.

While on duty, Mishti receives a radio call indicating that an accident occurred at the Robinson Heights housing development site. Mishti arrives to find Leo being treated by paramedics after being crushed by a concrete slab. After Leo is given the all clear, Mishti tells him she is pregnant. Kirsha hears about Mishti's pregnancy and tells her family. Mishti experiences pains and miscarries her baby. She and Leo agree that it was too soon to start a family and move on. Mishti's former colleague [[Monique Hughes]] (Madeleine Vizard) visits and they reminisce about their time working with Zander. Monique discovers that Lassiters have illegally sold alcohol to Xanthe and she tries to blackmail Leo in exchange for her silence. This causes Leo to hire a private investigator and he discovers that Monique and Zander had been involved with illegal gangs. Leo informs Mishti who is devastated that her boyfriend, best friend and ex-fiancé have all lied to her. She realises she can no longer trust anyone and ends her relationship with Leo. Mishti has a one-night stand with Dilhan Ozdil and he steals money from her purse. Dilhan threatens to upload footage of them having sex to the internet if she does not drop the theft charges. Aaron helps Mishti retrieve the footage and she arrests Dilhan. He is granted bail and makes the footage public. Mishti delivers a talk at Erinsborough High about the emotional impact of revenge porn. She tries to move on, but Dilhan starts sending her abusive text messages. 

When she is home alone Dilhan's texts make her feel unsafe. Chloe creeps into Mishti's back garden to check-up on her, Mishti withdraws her gun and discharges a warning shot. Mishti is overcome with guilt and reports herself to the police, who decide not to take any legal action and request that she retakes her weapon training. Mishti sells her half of The Shed to Paul. After an unsuccessful date with [[Rob Carson]] (Christopher Farrell), Mishti joins an arranged marriage website, where she meets Sydney dentist Pavan Nahal. After opening up about their pasts, Mishti and Pavan become engaged. Mishti agrees to help [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) search for Monique and contacts her. Monique has Dilhan beaten up, before meeting with Mishti. Monique realises she is being set up and Mishti arrests her. At the station, Mishti learns that she is compromised an investigation and is suspended. Pavan calls of the engagement when he learns about the sex tape and Mishti accuses Dipi of telling him about it. Dipi later intervenes and speaks to Pavan. She learns that Monique sent the video, and that he was angry that Mishti did not tell him about it. Pavan comes to see Mishti and they reconcile. When he receives a job offer in Sydney, Mishti decides to leave Erinsborough to be with him. Dipi organises a farewell party for her before she departs.

'''Orality''' is [[thought]] and verbal expression in societies where the technologies of [[literacy]] (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population.  The study of orality is closely allied to the study of [[oral tradition]].  

The term “orality” has been used in a variety of ways, often to describe, in a generalised fashion, the structures of consciousness found in cultures that do not employ, or employ minimally, the technologies of writing. 

[[Walter J. Ong]]’s work was foundational for the study of orality, and reminds us that despite the striking success and subsequent power of written language, the vast majority of languages are never written, and  the basic orality of language is permanent.{{sfn|Cronin|Crosson|Eastlake|2009|p=5}} 

In his later publications Ong distinguishes between two forms of orality: 'primary orality' and 'secondary orality'. Primary orality is thought and expression un-touched by the culture of writing of print; ''[[secondary orality]]'' is explained by Ong as oral culture defined by (implicitly influenced) by the written and printed word, and includes oral culture made possible by technology such as a [[newscaster]] reading a news report on television.

In addition, 'residual orality' is also defined - it is the remnants, legacy, or influence of a predominately oral culture carried over into the written realm - an example might include the use of [[dialogue]] as a philosophical or didactic tool in written literature, such as used by the Greek thinker [[Plato]].

== Origins of philosophy and definition  ==

===Impact of literacy on culture===
Before writing became a way for many [[cultures]] before we had orality. Unfortunately many of the retained orality has been lost or drastically changed. Those that were able to be preserved gives us insight to past cultures and just how much we have evolved since then.&lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Orality and Literacy'' (2nd ed. {{harvnb|Ong|2002}}), Ong sums up his own work over the previous three decades as well as the work of numerous other scholars. With regard to oral tradition and primary orality he  draws on pioneering work by [[Milman Parry]], [[Albert B. Lord]], and [[Eric A. Havelock]]. [[Marshall McLuhan]] was among the first to fully appreciate the significance of the Ong's earlier work about print culture and the [[written and printed word]] as a [[technology]].  In his work ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' {{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}} McLuhan quotes and discusses works by Ong in the 1950s regarding print culture.{{sfn|McLuhan|1962|pp= 104, 129, 146, 159–60, 162–63, 168, 174–76}}; Orality gave us the stepping stones that allowed us to get where we are today, it was a necessity for the growth of civilization. &lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;But using his own examples to amplify Ong's thought, McLuhan shows how each stage in the development of this technology throughout the [[history of communication]] – from the invention of speech (primary orality), to [[pictograms]],  to the [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic alphabet]], to [[typography]], to the electronic communications of today – restructures human consciousness, profoundly changing not only the frontiers of human possibility, but even the frontiers it is possible for humans to imagine.

===Primary orality===
'Primary orality' refers to thought and its verbal expression within cultures "totally untouched by any knowledge of [[writing]] or [[Printing|print]]."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=11}}

All [[sound]] is inherently powerful. If a hunter kills a lion he can see it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if he hears a lion he must act, fast, because the sound of the lion signals its presence and its power. [[Speech communication|Speech]] is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p= 32}}

Writing is powerful in a different way: it permits people to generate ideas, store them, and retrieve them as needed across time in a highly efficient and accurate way. The absence of this technology in oral societies limits the development of complex ideas and the [[institution]]s that depend on them. Instead, sustained thought in oral settings depends on interpersonal communication, and storing complex ideas over a long period of time requires packaging them in highly memorable ways, generally by using [[mnemonic]] tools.

In his studies of the [[Homeric Question]], [[Milman Parry]] was able to show that the poetic metre found in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' had been 'packaged' by oral [[Greece|Greek]] society to meet its information management needs. These insights first opened the door to a wider appreciation of the sophistication of [[oral tradition]]s, and their various methods of managing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first = Adam | editor-last = Parry | title = The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry | publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford| year = 1971|page = 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, ancient and medieval mnemonic tools were extensively documented by [[Frances Yates]] in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]''.{{harv|Yates|1966}}

===Residual orality===
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Socrates in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', quoting the prophecy of [[Amun|Ammon]] (Thamus) : ''"[Writing] will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. [..] You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom.."'' (trans. H.N. Fowler; Line 275)]]
‘Residual orality’ refers to thought and its verbal expression in cultures that have been exposed to writing and print, but have not fully ‘interiorized’ (in McLuhan’s term) the use of these technologies in their daily lives.  As a culture interiorizes the technologies of literacy, the ‘oral residue’ diminishes.

But the availability of a technology of literacy to a society is not enough to ensure its widespread diffusion and use.  For example, [[Eric Havelock]] observed in ''A Preface to Plato'' that after the [[ancient Greeks]] invented writing they adopted a [[scribe|scribal]] culture that lasted for generations.  Few people, other than the scribes, considered it necessary to learn to read or write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Havelock | first = Eric A.| title = A Preface to Plato | publisher =  Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts| year =1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other societies, such as [[ancient Egypt]] or [[medieval Europe]], literacy has been a domain confined to political and religious elites.

Many cultures have experienced an equilibrium state in which writing and mass illiteracy have co-existed for hundreds or even thousands of years.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp= 92–93}}

Oral residue rarely disappears quickly and never vanishes completely.  [[Speech communication|Speech]] is inherently an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts.  Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly shown in the arguments of [[Socrates]] against writing in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]''.  Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman.  It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the [[human mind]] into mere objects in the physical world.  By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what they are able to think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory.  True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds.  And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying the same thing over and over again, no matter how often it is refuted.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=78–79}}

The Canadian communications scholar, [[Harold Innis]] argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece in Plato's time. Plato conveyed his ideas by writing down the conversations of Socrates thus "preserving the power of the spoken word on the written page." [[Aristotle]], Innis wrote, regarded Plato's style as "halfway between poetry and prose." Plato was able to arrive at new philosophical positions "through the use of dialogues, allegories and illustrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harold | first = Innis | title = Empire and Communications | location= Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press | year = 1950 | pages = 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as McLuhan emphasizes, modernization attenuates some oral capabilities.  For example, in medieval Europe silent reading was largely unknown.  This tilted the readers' attention towards the poetic and other auditory aspects of the text.  Educated modern adults may also occasionally long for something like "the capacious medieval memory, which, untrammeled by the associations of print, could learn a strange language with ease and by the methods of a child, and could retain in memory and reproduce lengthy epic and elaborate lyric poems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=McLuhan|edition=1962| first=H.J. | last =Chaytor | title = From Script to Print|publisher=  Heffer and Sons|location= Cambridge| year= 1945| page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McLuhan and Ong also document the apparent re-emergence, in the electronic age, of a kind of '[[secondary orality]]' that displaces written words with audio/visual technologies like [[radio]], [[telephones]], and [[television]].  Unlike primary oral modes of communication, these technologies depend on print for their existence.  Mass Internet collaborations, such as Wikipedia, rely primarily on writing, but re-introduce relationships and responsiveness into the text.

===Importance of the concept===
:''For more details on the social, economic and other effects of literacy or illiteracy see [[Literacy]]''
It has been a habit of literate cultures to view oral cultures simply in terms of their lack of the technologies of writing. This habit, argues Ong, is dangerously misled. Oral cultures are living cultures in their own right. A 1971 study found that of 3,000 extant languages, only 78 had a written [[literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edmonson, Monro E.|title=Lore: An Introduction to the Science of Folklore and Literature|publisher= Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston|location= New York|date= 1971|pages= 323, 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; While literacy extends human possibilities in both thought and action, all literate technologies ultimately depend on the ability of humans to learn oral languages and then translate sound into symbolic imagery.

Understanding between nations may depend to some degree on understanding oral culture. Ong argues that "many of the contrasts often made between 'western' and other views seem reducible to contrasts between deeply interiorized literacy and more or less residually oral states of consciousness."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=29}}

==Theory of the characteristics of oral culture==
Drawing on hundreds of studies from [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]] and the study of [[oral tradition]], Ong summarizes ten key aspects of the '[[psychodynamics]] of orality'. While these are subject to continuing debate, his list remains an important milestone. Ong draws his examples from both primary oral societies, and societies with a very high 'oral residue'.

===Formulaic styling===
To retain complex ideas requires that they be packaged memorably for easy recall.

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| To solve effectively the problem of retaining and retrieving carefully articulated thought, you have to do your thinking in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral recurrence. Your thoughts must come into being in heavily rhythmic, balanced patterns, in repetitions or antithesis, in alliterations or assonances, in epithetic and other formulary expressions… Serious thought is intertwined with memory systems.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=34}}
|}

Anthropologist [[Marcel Jousse]] identifies a close linkage between [[rhythm]] and breathing patterns, gestures and the bilateral symmetry of the human body in several ancient verse traditions.{{sfn|Ong|2002|loc=p.34 citing {{harv|Jousse|1978}} }} This synergy between the body and the construction of oral thought further fuels memory.

===Additive rather than subordinative===
Oral cultures avoid complex 'subordinative' clauses. Ong cites an example from the [[Douay-Rheims]] version of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (1609–10), noting that this basic additive pattern (in ''italics'') has been identified in many oral contexts around the world:{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=37}}

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning God created heaven and earth. ''And'' the earth was void and empty, ''and'' darkness was on the face of the deep; ''and'' the spirit of God moved over the waters. ''And'' God said …
|}

Demonstrating how oral modes of communication tend to evolve into literate ones, Ong additionally cites the [[New American Bible]] (1970), which offers a translation that is grammatically far more complex:

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters. Then God said …
|}

===Aggregative rather than analytic===
Oral expression brings words together in pithy phrases that are the product of generations of evolution: the 'sturdy oak tree', the 'beautiful princess' or 'clever Odysseus'. This does not apply specifically to [[poetry]] or [[song]]; rather the words are brought together out of habit during general communication. 'Analyzing' or breaking apart such expressions is risky: they represent the work of generations and "there is nowhere outside the mind to store them."

Ong cites an American example, noting that in some parts of the [[United States]] with heavy oral residue, until the early twentieth-century it was still considered normal or even obligatory to use the adjective ‘glorious’ when referring to the '[[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]'.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=39}}

===Redundant or 'copious'===
Speech that repeats earlier thoughts or thought-pictures, or shines a different light on them somehow, helps to keep both the speaker and the listener focused on the topic, and makes it easier for all to recall the key points later. "Oral cultures encourage fluency, fulsomeness, volubility. Rhetoricians were to call this [[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style|copia]]"{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=40}}

===Conservative or traditionalist===
Because oral societies have no effective access to writing and print technologies, they must invest considerable energy in basic [[information management]]. Storage of information, being primarily dependent on individual or collective recall, must be handled with particular thrift. It is possible to approximately measure oral residue "from the amount of memorization the culture's educational procedures require."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first =Jack|editor-last =  Goody| at = introduction, pp.13-14 | title = Literacy in traditional societies | publisher =  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge | year = 1968  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This creates incentives to avoid exploring new ideas and particularly to avoid the burden of having to store them. It does not prevent oral societies from demonstrating dynamism and change, but there is a premium on ensuring that changes cleave to traditional formulas, and "are presented as fitting the traditions of the ancestors."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=42}}

===Close to the human lifeworld===
Oral cultures take a practical approach to information storage. To qualify for storage, information must usually concern matters of immediate practical concern or familiarity to most members of the society.

Long after the invention of writing, and often long after the invention of print, basic information on how to perform a society’s most important trades was left unwritten, passed from one generation to the next as it always had been: through [[apprenticeship]], observation and practice.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=43}}

By contrast, only literary cultures have launched phenomenological analyses, abstract classifications, ordered lists and tables, etc. Nothing analogous exists in oral societies.

===Agonistically toned===
[[File:Beowulf and the dragon.jpg|left|thumb|Beowulf fights the dragon: the oral world is agonistic]]
'Agonistic' means 'combative', but Ong actually advances a deeper thesis with this point. Writing and to an even greater extent print, he argues, disengage humans from direct, interpersonal struggle.

Products of "the highly polarized, agonistic, oral world of good and evil, virtue and vice, villains and heroes," the great works of [[oral literature]] from [[Homer]] to [[Beowulf]], from the [[Mwindo epic]] to the [[Old Testament]], are extremely violent by modern standards. They are also punctuated by frequent and intense intellectual combat and tongue-lashings on the one hand, and effusive praise (perhaps reaching its height among [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[griot|praise singers]]) on the other.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=43–45}}

===Empathetic and participatory===
In an oral culture the most reliable and trusted technique for learning is to share a "close, empathetic, communal association" with others who know.

Ong cites a study of community decision-making from 12th Century [[England]]. Writing already had a long history in England, and it would have been possible to use texts to establish for example, the age of majority of the heir to an estate. But people were skeptical about texts, noting not only the cost of generating and managing them, but the problems involved in preventing tampering or frauds.

As a result, they retained the traditional solution: gathering together "mature wise seniors of many years, having good testimony", and publicly discussing the age of the heir with them, until agreement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = M.T. |last = Clanchy | title = From Memory to Written Record, England 1066–1307 | publisher =  Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts | year =  1979 | pages = 230–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hallmark principle of orality, that truth emerges best from communal process, resonates today in the [[jury]] system.

===Homeostatic===
Oral societies conserve their limited capacity to store information, and retain the relevance of their information to the interest of their present members, by shedding memories that have lost their past significance.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|pp=31–34}}

While many examples exist, the classic example was reported by {{harvnb|Goody|Watt|1968}}. Written records prepared by the British in [[Ghana]] in the early 1900s show that [[Ndewura Jakpa]], the seventeenth century founder of the state of the [[Gonja people]], had seven sons, each of whom ruled a territorial division within the state. Six decades later two of the divisions had disappeared for various reasons. The myths of the Gonja had been revised to recount that Jakpa had five sons, and that five divisions were created.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|p=33}} Since they had no practical, present purpose, the other two sons and divisions had evaporated.

===Situational rather than abstract===
In oral cultures, concepts are used in a way that minimizes abstraction, focusing to the greatest extent possible on objects and situations directly known by the speaker. A study by [[Alexander Luria]], a psychologist who did extensive fieldwork comparing oral and literate subjects in remote areas of [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kirghizia]] in 1931–2&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Aleksandr Romanovich | last = Luria | title = Cognitive Development: Its Social and Cultural Foundations| editor-first = Michael |editor-last = Cole| translator-first =Martin | translator-last = Lopez-Morillas |translator-first2 = Lynn | translator-last2= Solotaroff |publisher = Harvard University Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London| year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; documented the highly situational nature of oral thinking.

* Oral subjects always used real objects they were familiar with to refer to geometric shapes; for example a plate or the moon might be used to refer to a circle.
* Asked to select three similar words from the following list "hammer, saw, log, hatchet", oral subjects would reject the literate solution (removing the log to produce a list of 3 tools), pointing out that without the log there wasn't much use for the tools.
* Oral subjects took a practical, not an abstract, approach to syllogisms. Luria asked them this question. ''In the far north, where there is snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is in the far north and there is always snow there. What colour are the bears?'' Typical response: "I don't know. I've seen a black bear. I've never seen any others. … Every locality has its own animals."
* Oral subjects proved unwilling to analyze themselves. When asked "what sort of person are you?" one responded: "What can I say about my own heart? How can I talk about my character? Ask others; they can tell you about me. I myself can’t say anything."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=49–54}}

Posey Oliver '''"P.O" Davis''' (1890–1973), was an American educator and administrator, as well as a pioneering agricultural editor and broadcaster.

He perhaps is best remembered as the longest serving director of the Alabama Extension Service (now known as the [[Alabama Cooperative Extension System]]) and for helping Alabama agriculture through a critical period of development.

Davis also emerged as a national leader of and advocate for farming and [[Cooperative Extension]] work in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Yeager, Joseph and Stevenson, Gene, "Inside Ag Hill: The People and Events That Shaped Auburn's Agricultural History from 1872 through 1999", Chelsea, Michigan: Sheridan Books, 1999. pp.90-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Davis was born in a rural hamlet known as Skinhead near [[Athens, Alabama]], on Aug. 15, 1890, to Richard Scoggins Davis and the former Mildred Elizabeth Barker.  In a family genealogy written several years before his death, Davis recalled Skinhead as the place where his "depleted family settled after being blasted out of McMinn County, Tennessee, by the hell of the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]]." &lt;ref name="My Davis Family Ancestors"&gt;Davis, P.O., "My Davis Family Ancestors," (Self-Published Book), Auburn University Special Collections, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis also recalled that while this tiny community lacked intellectual and cultural sophistication, it was a place where "people go to church, treat their neighbors right, tend to their own business and still believe God is for the living and the dead."

After working for a while as a public school teacher from 1909 to 1912, Davis enrolled at Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now [[Auburn University]]), located in [[Auburn, Alabama]], where he graduated in 1916.  From 1916-17, he worked as a horticulturist for the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station, leaving to take a job as an agriculturist with Southern Railway.&lt;ref name="My Davis Family Ancestors"/&gt;  He also worked briefly as an assistant boys club agent.&lt;ref name=yeager&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yeager |first1= Joseph |last2=Stevenson |first2= Gene |title= "Inside Ag Hill: The People and Events That Shaped Auburn's Agricultural History from 1872 through 1999" |location= Chelsea, Michigan|publisher= Sheridan Books|date= 1999 |pages= 400–01|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married the former Mildred Kilburn, of [[Florence, Alabama|Florence]], in 1918.

Davis worked briefly for Progressive Farmer before returning to API in 1920 to serve as an agricultural editor for the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station and the Alabama Extension Service.&lt;ref name="My Davis Family Ancestors"/&gt;

==WAPI==

Shortly after assuming his new role as editor, Davis, however reluctantly, became one of the South's radio pioneers.

His involvement in this emerging medium followed after [[Birmingham News]] publisher Victor Hanson offered API $2,500 to establish a radio station to provide educational information to farmers and other API audiences. Recalling the incident more than 40 years later to then-Auburn University president [[Ralph Brown Draughon]], Davis viewed the donation as practically meaningless, because it scarcely was enough to purchase the equipment to broadcast the signal, let alone to operate the station on a daily basis.  Another limiting factor was the scarce number of radio receivers available in Alabama at the time.

Unfortunately for Davis, the API administration, as well as his immediate supervisor, then-Alabama Extension Director [[Luther Duncan]], fearing the bad publicity that would follow if they refused the donation, saw things differently. Davis, as the institution's editor and publicist, was assigned the task of securing funds and personnel to operate the new station.

It marked the beginning of a long, and as Davis recounted late in life, largely frustrating, association with this new medium.  Simply acquiring an engineer who knew anything about radio was challenging enough.

As Davis recalled, WMAV was installed on the evening of February 22, 1923.  By then, the Extension Service already had spent far beyond the initial $2,500 donation.

"We pecked and struggled as best we could with the equipment that was almost obsolete by the time it was installed," he recalled.&lt;ref name="Radio Station WAPI"&gt;Davis, P.O., "Radio Station WAPI; a history as told in a letter to Dr. Ralph B. Draughon from Mr. P. O. Davis, November 25, 1961," Auburn University Special Collections.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WAPI-radio.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Davis worked with Alabama Extension agents throughout the state to organize radio listening sessions with farmers and their families. Extension Home Demonstration Agent Thalia Bell operates a radio at the Sandy Creek-East View Club, Tallapoosa County, Feb. 4, 1926.]]After acquiring entirely new equipment, Davis moved the facility to Comer Hall and acquired new call letters: WAPI, which are still carried by the station today.  Davis also was instrumental in working with agents to organize radio listening parties for audiences throughout the state — a practice that would foreshadow [[videoconferencing]] techniques common today.{{sfn|Yeager|Stevenson|1999|pp=400-01}}

After repeated unsuccessful attempts to affiliate with a national network — NBC or CBS — Davis decided to move the station to Birmingham after securing a pledge from city officials to provide half of the annual operating costs, totaling approximately $20,000.

As an additional cost-cutting measure, Davis also negotiated an arrangement with the [[University of Alabama]] and Alabama College at Montevallo (now [[University of Montevallo]]) to operate the station in partnership with API.

The arrangement with Birmingham and the other two institutions worked reasonably well, Davis recalls, until the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, after which the cash-strapped city was forced to renege on the deal.  This critical disruption in income forced Davis to lease the station — a "long and painful effort," as he recalled.

Even so, Davis did not find the effort entirely unsatisfying.  WAPI not only provided the three institutions with a broadcast presence but also ensured a "nice annual return on their investments" from about 1922 to 1961.

"Some day, I hope a competent historian will dig up all of the facts and write much more in detail than I have about WAPI — a comprehensive history," Davis stated in the Draughon letter. "I believe that it would be a story well worth writing and reading if done accurately and intelligently."&lt;ref name="Radio Station WAPI"/&gt;

==Publicist and Executive Secretary==

All the while Davis served as WAPI general manager, he also carried on his duties as editor of the Extension Service and the Experiment Station.  He is distinguished for building one of the nation's leading public communications programs of his era.  His work as an Extension agricultural editor served as a model for Extension programs in other states for reaching farmers and other audiences through print and broadcast media.  In an era when agriculture comprised a major pillar of the U.S. economy, many of Davis' staff people were in hot demand among farm-related publications, agencies and businesses.{{sfn|Yeager|Stevenson|1999|p. 335}}

Davis was also considered a tireless Extension worker.  Records show that in 1925, he traveled almost 14,000 miles by train and more than 3,300 miles by car to carry out his work.{{sfn|Yeager|Stevenson|1999|p=92}}

People who worked with Davis recall that he never overcame his editing proclivities even after he became Extension director, frequently correcting grammatical and syntactical lapses in reports and other documents.

From 1933-36, he also wore two other professional hats, serving Alabama Extension as executive secretary and registrar.{{sfn|Yeager|Stevenson|1999|p=401}}

==Extension Director, 1937-1959==

Following predecessor Luther Duncan's ascension to the API presidency in 1937, Davis was appointed director of the Alabama Extension Service, going on to become the longest tenured director in Alabama Extension history.{{sfn|Yeager|Stevenson|1999|p=335}}

Davis was considered an idealist and one who was far less politically motivated than Duncan.  The cerebral Davis also was criticized for not identifying closely enough with farmers — he "didn't have enough dirt on his shoes" to connect with the state's farmers, as one employee recounted years later.{{sfn|Yeager|Stevenson|1999|p=335}}

In the view of many, though, he was an extrovert, also blessed with considerable communicative and organizational skills — attributes which, coupled with a deep devotion to the Cooperative Extension mission, more than compensated for any shortcomings.{{sfn|Yeager|Stevenson|1999|p=335}}

==National Farm and Extension Leader==

As a result of his effective Extension leadership during the late Depression and through the war years, Davis emerged as a national agricultural leader and spokesman, which enabled him to influence the course of federal legislation throughout the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] years — in the view of some, a critical asset in an era when the federal government exerted an especially strong influence on farm policy.

Davis also was highly regarded as a public speaker, traveling throughout the South and through much of the nation sharing his views on the future of agriculture and Extension's evolving educational mission.{{sfn|Yeager|Stevenson|1999|p=497}}

==Personal philosophy==

Like many American educators of his era, Davis firmly believed in the transformative power of scientific progress, frequently expressing effusive pride in the role [[Cooperative Extension]] had played as a change agent in mechanizing Southern farming and rendering it more efficient and profitable.

"Together, we're engaged in the finest type of education anywhere and by any people," said Davis, in an address to the Association of County Commissioners and Probate Judges in Mobile, Alabama, in 1956.  "In brief, it is scientific and technical information for sound and practical people where they live and work."&lt;ref name="County Government and Extension Work"&gt;Davis, P.O., "County Government and Extension Work," An address to Association of County Commissioners and Probate Judges, Mobile, Alabama, Aug. 26, 1954. Agriculture and Extension Work, Part III, The Extension Service of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, Alabama, August, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

He often expressed exasperation with southern farmers who failed to heed the Cooperative Extension message, even describing the South as "a land of neglected opportunities" where producers were "not taking advantage of opportunities, little and big, around them and among them."
"With chagrin, I have known of southern families having to call on charity or upon government for food," said Davis, writing in 1938.  "To me, this is unthinkable except, of course, [in] emergency cases."

"Every farmer, either landlord or tenant, can have one or more fresh food products almost any day of the year, except after occasional hard freezes.  These, plus canned and dried products — also meat, milk and eggs, which can be produced at home — make a good diet, and plenty of it."&lt;ref name="Some Neglected Opportunties"&gt;Davis, P.O., "Some Neglected Opportunities," Agriculture: Its Background, Its Achievements, Its Organization, Its Challenge, Its Future," Extension Service, API, Auburn, Alabama.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was determined to step up efforts to reach farmers and their families who, for whatever reason, were not heeding the Cooperative Extension message.  In an article published in the Extension Review, he stressed that Extension workers must do a "bigger and better job of teaching and inspiring more people into action."

It was not enough merely to limit the Extension message to the small handful of farmers willing to become "Extension disciples," Davis stressed.  Instead, he envisioned and implemented a strategy that would reach all rural people with the "very best teaching methods at our disposal and the employment of the very best Extension workers."

Davis undertook a major technological overhaul of Alabama Extension field offices, providing each county office with "an addressing machine so that both big and little mailing lists can be used for effective contact through the mails."  Outlying offices also were provided with film-strip and stereopticon machines "so that each county worker may combine vision with sound in presenting facts at meetings."

Davis also expanded Alabama Extension's presence in both print and broadcast media.  He developed close working relationships with Alabama weekly and daily newspapers and with farm home publications.  Extension educational broadcasts were aired six days a week on most broadcast outlets in Alabama.

In addition, Davis oversaw the launching of "This Month in Rural Alabama," an 8-page tabloid that ran as an insert in 97 Alabama weekly newspapers.  With a publishing run of 100,000 weekly copies, it became the most widely circulated publication in Alabama.&lt;ref name="We Must Reach More People"&gt;Davis, P.O., "We Must Reach More People: An Editorial," Auburn University Special Collections, Auburn University, Alabama.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jeffersonian==

Davis respected the role science had played in the rapid advancement of southern agriculture, but his faith in scientific achievement and progress was qualified. From his own experience working with farmers, he knew that stunning technological advances often brought new and even more complicated challenges.  One notable example was the huge improvements in cotton yields that farmers, working closely with Extension agents, had made in spite of the persistent presence of the [[boll weevil]] — an achievement that, in turn, led to a cotton surplus and the "attending headaches and difficulties now so prevalent."

The farm surpluses associated with improved cotton farming methods concerned Davis — so, for that matter, did the region's excessive reliance on the crop.&lt;ref name="The Years Ahead in Home Demonstration Work"&gt;Davis, P.O., "The Years Ahead in Home Demonstration Work," Speech to the Home Demonstration Agents' Annual Meeting, Mobile, Alabama, March 2, 1956, Agriculture and Extension Work, Part III, The Extension Service of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, Alabama, August, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Davis-drive.jpg|thumb|pix300|right|P. O. Davis Drive, named in honor of Davis, on the Auburn University campus.]]Largely because of this, Davis was an early and vocal proponent of farm diversification.

"It is plain to me that cotton, upon which we are relying very largely for money income, must have help," wrote Davis in 1937.  "It is also plain that livestock and poultry are cotton's best helpers." &lt;ref name="The Type of Farming We Need"&gt;Davis, P.O., Agriculture: Its Background, Its Achievements, Its Organization, Its Challenge, Its Future," Extension Service, API, Auburn, Alabama.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lifelong [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrat]] who maintained a cordial working relationship with the Roosevelt Administration, Davis nonetheless feared the long-term social and cultural effects of industrialization — effects already reflected in the growing number of Americans who were working for employers rather than for themselves.

"So, individual freedom as our ancestor knew it is largely gone because one who works for another is not exactly free in the sense that one is who finances his business and works for himself," Davis stated late in his Extension career.

He believed that farmers, along with small storekeepers and small businessmen, were essential to preserving freedom in America, because they were "part capitalist and part worker." &lt;ref name="Cooperatives in Alabama Agriculture"&gt;Davis, P.O., "Cooperatives in Alabama Agriculture," Address to Alabama Cooperatives, July 21, 1951, Agriculture and Extension Work, Part III, The Extension Service of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, Alabama, August, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]] passion for farmers and small businessmen sentiment largely account for his intense interest in and sympathy for the [[Farm Bureau]] concept.

Without the cohesiveness Farm Bureaus around the country provided, farmers would be unable to withstand the onslaught of bigness in the form of both big government and big business, Davis believed.&lt;ref name="Facing the Future Together"&gt;Davis, P.O., "Facing the Future Together," Address to Alabama Farm Bureau Training School, Auburn, Alabama, July 30, 1952, Agriculture and Extension Work, Part III, The Extension Service of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, Alabama, August, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clash with Gov. James. E. "Big Jim" Folsom==

Davis's goal of building up Extension to reach as many rural Alabamians as possible was not without its critics.  These critics included [[James E. Folsom|Gov. James E. "Big Jim" Folsom]], who maintained that this zeal for Extension work often came at the expense of other agencies.

As ex-officio chairman of the API Board of Trustees, Folsom, working closely with his ally, Gould Beech, an API trustee, filed charges at a trustees meeting February 21, 1947, claiming that Alabama agriculture had suffered a relative decline in farm income, partly because of Davis' mismanagement of Extension.

Folsom also alleged that Extension failed to cooperate with other state and federal farm agencies and that it controlled the Alabama Farm Bureau, even choosing the president and delegates to Farm Bureau conventions.  The governor also maintained that Extension was too politically engaged and had even used its weight to defeat an income tax amendment.

Davis was eventually cleared by the trustees, who also passed a resolution commending him for his work.{{sfn|Yeager|Stevenson|1999|p=361-62}}

==Retirement==

For a time in the 1940s, there was a tug of war between Davis and Elbert H. Norton, state school superintendent, to succeed Luther Duncan, the API president, who had died unexpectedly in 1947.{{sfn|Yeager|Stevenson|1999|p=465}}

Davis retired in 1959 and was succeeded by [[E. T. York]].  He spent the last few years of his life compiling a family genealogy of the Davis family and serving on several professional and charitable boards.  He also served as president of the Alabama Writers Council from 1962-63.

Among his honors, he was voted "Man of the Year" in Agriculture by [[Progressive Farmer]] magazine and awarded a medal and certificate from the [[American Farm Bureau]] in 1945 for distinguished service to American agriculture.  He was also listed Who's Who in America for 1952-53.&lt;ref name="My Davis Family Ancestors"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18429">'''Peer education''' is an approach to [[health promotion]], in which community members are supported to promote health-enhancing change among their peers. Peer education is the teaching or sharing of health information, values and behavior in educating others who may share similar social backgrounds or life experiences.&lt;ref name="boyle"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boyle | first1 = J. | last2 = Mattern | first2 = C.

Rather than health professionals educating members of the public, the idea behind peer education is that ordinary lay people are in the best position to encourage healthy behaviour to each other.

==Areas of application==
Peer education has become very popular in the broad field of HIV prevention. It is a mainstay of HIV prevention in many developing countries,&lt;ref name="kelly"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = J. A. | last2 = St Lawrence | first2 = J. S. | last3 = Stevenson | first3 = L. Y. | last4 = Hauth | first4 = A. C. | last5 = Kalichman | first5 = S. C. | last6 = Diaz | first6 = Y. E. | last7 = Brasfield | first7 = T. L. | last8 = Koob | first8 = J. J. | last9 = Morgan | first9 = M. G. | year = 1992 | title = Community AIDS/HIV risk reduction: the effects of endorsements by popular people in three cities | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 82 | issue = 11| pages = 1483–1489 | doi=10.2105/ajph.82.11.1483 | pmc=2265204 | pmid=16282071}}&lt;/ref&gt; among groups including young people, sex workers, men who have unprotected sex with men, or people who use intravenous drugs.

Peer education is also associated with efforts to prevent tobacco, alcohol and other drug use among young people. Peer educators can be effective role models for young adolescents by promoting healthy behavior, helping to create and reinforce [[social norms]] that support safer behaviors, and also serve as an accessible and approachable health education resource both inside and outside the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Main, D. S. (2002). Commentary: Understanding the effects of peer education as a health promotion strategy. Health Education and Behaviour, 29(4), 424-426. doi: 10.1177/109019810202900403&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer education is useful in promoting healthy eating, [[food safety]] and physical activity amongst marginalized populations. Peer education is also favorably used in [[medical education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Kyle R.|last2=Qureshi|first2=Zeshan U.|last3=Ross|first3=Michael T.|last4=Maxwell|first4=Simon R.|date=2014-01-01|title=Junior doctor-led ‘near-peer’ prescribing education for medical students|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcp.12147/abstract|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|language=en|volume=77|issue=1|pages=122–129|doi=10.1111/bcp.12147|issn=1365-2125|pmc=3895353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeung|first=Eugene Y. H.|last2=Alexander|first2=Megan|date=2017-08-11|title=Use of junior doctor-led peer education to improve antibiotic stewardship|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|doi=10.1111/bcp.13375|issn=1365-2125|pmid=28799275|volume=83|pmc=5698584|pages=2831–2832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The process==
A peer education programme is usually initiated by health or community professionals, who recruit members of the ''target'' community to serve as peer educators. The recruited peer educators are trained in relevant health information and communication skills. Armed with these skills, the peer educators then engage their peers in conversations about the issue of concern, seeking to promote health-enhancing knowledge and skills. The intention is that familiar people, giving locally-relevant and meaningful suggestions, in appropriate local language and taking account of the local context, will be most likely to be able to promote health-enhancing behaviour change.

There is a great variety in the support provided to peer educators. Sometimes they are unpaid volunteers, sometimes they are given a small honorarium, sometimes they receive a reasonable salary. The peer educators may be supported by regular meetings and training, or expected to continue their work without formal supports.

==Theories==
A variety of theories are offered regarding the question of how peer education is supposed to achieve positive results.

(1). Positive results of a Peer Educator are achieved through educating individuals to enhance their understanding about diseases, alcohol and drug abuse etc. and effectively communicate what they've learned to other at-risk peers in their community. The goal is to educate and reach as many people to limit the spread of disease and to learn how to overcome drug and alcohol abuse etc.

===Kelly's popular opinion leader theory===
The popular opinion leader theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = J.A. | year = 2004 | title = Popular opinion leaders and HIV prevention peer education: resolving discrepant findings, and implications for the development of effective community programmes | url = http://www.effectiveinterventions.org/files/POL_files1%20Folder/POL_Kelly_Article04.pdf | format = PDF | journal = AIDS Care | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–150 | doi = 10.1080/09540120410001640986 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests a parallel between peer education and the marketing of commercial products. Peer educators are seen as ''opinion leaders''—respected and admired by other members of the community. These opinion leaders espouse a certain lifestyle (such as safer sex, or not smoking, etc.)—and their peers wish to emulate them.

===Critical consciousness===
Campbell argues that what peer education ought to do is to promote the kind of [[critical consciousness]] theorised by [[Paulo Freire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Catherine | last2 = MacPhail | first2 = Catherine | year = 2002 | title = Peer education, gender and the development of critical consciousness: participatory HIV prevention by South African youth | url = http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/385/ | journal = Social Science and Medicine | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 331–345 | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00289-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that peers use the peer education process to critically discuss their circumstances, especially the social factors impacting upon their health. Becoming critically aware of these forces is the first step to tackling them. So, for instance, if local norms regarding sexuality and gender put people's health at risk, this approach argues that peers should critically discuss those norms, so that they can then collectively seek to establish new more health-enhancing norms.

===Social learning theory===
Based on the work of [[Albert Bandura|Bandura]] and colleagues, [[social learning theory]] claims that modelling is an important component of the learning process. In the most basic sense, people observe behaviour taking place and then go on to adopt similar behaviour. Participants require the opportunity to practice modelled behavior and positive reinforcement if it is to be adopted successfully.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1977) Social Learning Theory. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential association theory===
Based on the work of Sutherland and Cressy,&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, E. H. and Cressy, D. R. (1960) Principles of Criminology. Lippincott, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt; [[differential association theory]] has been applied to the study of crime. Rather than the result of biological or psychological disorders, crime is a learned behaviour. This learning happens in social situations by associating with those who can teach the necessary skills and techniques needed. Through this theory it can be understood that peers can be very influential for both positive and negative behaviours. Young people can learn both good and bad habits from each other. In differential association theory the mere association with others provides a learning opportunity. If social learning theory is essentially psychological, differential association theory is essentially sociological.

===Role theory===
Sarbin argues that peer educators will adapt to the role expectations of a tutor and behave appropriately. Furthermore, through adopting a role, individuals develop a deeper understanding and commitment to it. The potential is that Peer educators can develop a stronger commitment and a greater appreciation of the relevance of the health topic. [[Role theory]] is also based on the premise that communication can be blocked by differences in [[culture]] between the teacher and learner. Peer educators who have a similar set of experiences and culture are therefore likely to be more effective in promoting learning.&lt;ref&gt;Sarbin, T. R. and Allen, V. L. (1968) Role theory. In Lindzey, G. and Aronson, E. (eds), Handbook of Social Psychology, Vol. 1. Addison-Wesley, Reading, pp. 488–567.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication of innovations theory===
Developed by [[Everett Rogers|Rogers]] and Shoemaker, the communication of innovations theory explains how innovations come to be adopted by communities and what factors influence the rate of adoption. These factors include the characteristics of those who adopt the innovation, the nature of the social system, the characteristics of the innovation and the characteristics of change agents. Rogers and Shoemaker argue that all innovations follow a similar pattern of adoption, with one group of people—the ''innovators''—taking it up immediately. Then there are ''early adopters'', the ''early majority'', the ''late majority'' and finally the ''laggards'', including some who never adopt the innovation. In this theory key people influence the opinion leaders within a community. Change agents can be viewed as health professionals while opinion leaders correlate with peer educators. Rogers and Shoemaker argue that effective communication occurs when the source and receiver are ''homophilous'', that is, are similar in certain attributes. These include beliefs, values, education and social status. This would suggest that peers communicate better than those who are unequal or different.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. M. and Shoemaker, F. F. (1971) Communication of Innovations. New York, Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Peer educators are seen as credible sources of information.&lt;ref name="sriranganathan" /&gt; This has been shown to be particularly effective amongst the youth population. Peers and peer education are an important influence and approach in changing health behaviours.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cui"&gt;Cui, Z., Shah, S., Yan, L., Yongping, P., Gao, A., Shi, X., Wu, Y., &amp; Dibley, M. J. (2012). Effect of a school-based peer education intervention on physical activity and sedentary behavior in Chinese adolescents: A pilot study. BMJ Open 2:e0000721. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000721&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the beliefs of peer education is that it is cost effective. Peer education has been identified as a more economical way to deliver health training.&lt;ref name="boyle" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="wiskochil"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiskochil | first1 = B. | last2 = Lieberman | first2 = L. | last3 = Houston-Wilson | first3 = C. | last4 = Petersen | first4 = S. | year = 2007 | title = The effects of trained peer tutors on the physical education of children who are visually impaired | url = | journal = Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness | volume = 101 | issue = 6| pages = 339–350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of peer educators can extend health promotion outreach and be more accessible than paid health professionals.  Peer educators help to bridge many of the gaps in service that occur through fear and suspicion of official health care providers, and to facilitate effective communication with community members and professional provider.&lt;ref name="wiskochil" /&gt; Engaging [[youth]] peer educators helps professionals to extend their outreach of programs and services to ensure their efforts are impactful.

Peer education is empowering from both the standpoint of the peer educator and the individual receiving service. Peer education has been operative in encouraging knowledge, attitudes and intention to change behavior in AIDS prevention.&lt;ref name="cui" /&gt; Furthermore, nondirective peer support has been identified as the best way to motivate individuals in the preparation, action, or maintenance [[Transtheoretical model|stages of readiness to change.]]&lt;ref&gt;Richert, M. L., Jones Webb, A., Morse, N.A., O'Toole, M. L., &amp; Brownson, C. A. (2007).  Move more diabetes: Using lay health educators to support physical activity in a community-based chronic disease self-management program. The Diabetes Educator, 33 (6), 179-184. doi: 10.1177/0145721707304172&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have acknowledged that trained peer tutors were more effective than the untrained peers in influencing positive health outcomes.&lt;ref name="wiskochil" /&gt; Peer education offers the educators the opportunity to benefit from taking on meaningful roles. Peer educators can act as enthusiastic advocates for the program and have a sense of purpose in their community outreach efforts.&lt;ref name="kim"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = S. | last2 = Koniak-Griffin | first2 = D. | last3 = Flaskerud | first3 = J. H. | last4 = Guarnero | first4 = P. A. | year = 2004 | title = The impact of lay health advisors on cardiovascular health promotion | url = | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 192–199 | doi=10.1097/00005082-200405000-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer education is sustainable.  This has been found to be an important issue for community-based health promotion interventions to make a difference over time.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; A [[grassroots]] initiative involving volunteers means that the health issue is reaching the target audience continuously with less of a threat of financial cutbacks impacting on their work. Research findings support the use of volunteer peer educators as a feasible and effective healthcare delivery strategy and as having promising indicators of [[sustainability]] over time.&lt;ref name="kim" /&gt; Sustainability through the engagement of peer educators can strengthen the social environment so that it is supportive of healthy behaviors.

==Debates==
Despite its popularity, the evidence about peer education is mixed, and there is no consensus on whether it works or how it works. Researchers have questioned the validity of the assumption that peer education influences behavior.&lt;ref name="sriranganathan" /&gt;

One important line of inquiry suggests that peer education may work in some contexts but not in others.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, G., Williamson, L., &amp; Flowers, P. (2004). [http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;uid=2003-10699-003 Good in parts: the Gay Men's Task Force in Glasgow - a response to Kelly]. ''AIDS'' Care, 16(2), 159-165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elford | first1 = J. | last2 = Bolding | first2 = G. | last3 = Sherr | first3 = L. | year = 2004 | title = Popular opinion leaders in London: A response to Kelly | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;uid=2003-10699-002 | journal = AIDS Care | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 151–158 | doi=10.1080/09540120410001640995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study comparing peer education among sex workers in India and South Africa found that the more successful Indian group benefited from a supportive social and political context, and a more effective community development ethos, rather than the biomedical focus of the South African intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cornish | first1 = F. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = C. | year = 2009 | title = The social conditions for successful peer education: A comparison of two HIV prevention programs run by sex workers in India and South Africa | url = https://gcal.academia.edu/FloraCornish/Papers/105446/The-social-conditions-for-successful-peer-education--A-comparison-of-two-HIV-prevention-programs-run-by-sex-workers-in-India-and-South-Africa | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1–2| pages = 123–135 | doi=10.1007/s10464-009-9254-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key issue concerns what a peer is and who defines this. In some instances age is a central factor but in other contexts, commonalities such as status may be more relevant.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt; Caution has been noted regarding selection of peer educators. Some argue that there can be a stigma held against peer educators who have faced adversities in their own lives, particularly by mainstream health service organizations and professionals.&lt;ref name="sriranganathan" /&gt; Alternatively, peers educators would need to have high status within their social group to be effective.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt; Researchers have argued that peer educators sometimes receive inadequate training, which limits their ability to educate their peers effectively and further state that peer selection and training is very important.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sriranganathan" /&gt;

An important analysis on the development of many peer education projects is that it is led by adult constructions of adolescence and adolescent health behaviour. A central question should therefore be whose agenda is being served by using peer education projects which manipulate and exploit the social worlds of young people?&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20126">'''Programmed learning''' (or '''programmed instruction''') is a research-based system which helps learners work successfully. The method is guided by research done by a variety of [[Applied psychology|applied psychologists]] and educators.&lt;ref name=Lums&gt;Lumsdaine A.A. 1963. Instruments and media of instruction. In N.L. Gage (ed) ''Handbook of research on teaching''. Chicago: AERA and Rand McNally, 583–682.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[learning material]] is in a kind of [[textbook]] or [[teaching machine]] or [[computer]]. The [[media (communication)|medium]] presents the material in a logical and tested sequence. The text is in small steps or larger chunks. After each step, learners are given a question to test their comprehension. Then immediately the correct answer is shown. This means the learner at all stages makes responses, and is given immediate [[knowledge of results]].&lt;ref&gt;Margulies S. &amp; Eigen L.D. 1961. ''Applied programmed instruction''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sue/&gt;

Anticipating programmed learning, [[Edward L. Thorndike]] wrote in 1912:
{{Pull quote|text=If, by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity, a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible, and so on, much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print.|author=Edward L. Thorndike|source=''Education: A First Book''&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike E.L. 1912. ''Education: a first book''. New York: Macmillan, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.coe.uh.edu/smcneil/cuin6373/idhistory/pressey.html McNeil S. A hypertext history of instructional design]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thorndike, however, did nothing with his idea. The first such system was devised by [[Sidney L. Pressey]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Pressey S.L. 1926. A simple apparatus which gives tests and scores {{ndash}} and teaches. ''School &amp; Society'' '''23''', 373{{ndash}}6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pressey, S.L. 1927. A machine for automatic teaching of drill material. ''School &amp; Society'' '''25''', 544–552.&lt;/ref&gt; "The first... [teaching machine] was developed by Sidney L. Pressey... While originally developed as a self-scoring machine... [it] demonstrated its ability to actually teach."&lt;ref&gt;Hilgard E.R. 1966. Learning &amp; the technology of instruction. Chapter 16 in Hilgard E.R. &amp; Bower G.H. 1966. ''Theories of learning''. 3rd ed, New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, p554{{ndash}}561 Programmed learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==
In [[World War II]], with largely [[conscription|conscript]] armies, there was great emphasis on [[training]]. What was learnt influenced education and training after the war. One of the main methods was the use of [[film]] as a group training method. Research on the effectiveness of training films was done extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Lumsdaine A.A. 1947. Experimental research and the improvement of teaching films. ''Educational Screen'' '''26''', 254/5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hovland C.I; Lumsdaine A.A. &amp; Sheffield F.D. 1949. ''Experiments on mass communication''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lumsdaine A.A. 1953. Audio-visual research in the U.S. Air Force. ''AV Communication Review'' '''1''', 76–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May M.A. &amp; Lumsdaine A.A. 1958. ''Learning from films''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In one account, [[Arthur A. Lumsdaine|Lumsdaine]] comments that research on films went on "from about 1918 to the present" (meaning 1962).&lt;ref name=Art&gt;Lumsdaine A.A. 1962, published 1965. Experimental research on instructional devices and materials. In Glaser R. (ed) ''Training research and education''. New York: Wiley, 252; 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few conclusions stood out from the research. First, films were great at giving overviews of a situation or an operation. However, they were less successful at getting over the details. Some general features of film (and, later, television) stand out. One is that a film goes at its own pace. Another is that no specific responses or activities are required from the viewer. A third is that the audience is varied, sometimes hugely varied. This gives clues to ways of improving instructional films.

In a 1946 experiment at [[Yale University]], questions for students were put between segments of a film on the [[heart]] and [[circulatory system|circulation]], with correct answers given after students had responded (knowledge of results). This added significantly to the amount learnt from the film. Lumsdaine commented that showing the version with questions and answers was as effective as showing the film twice, and faster.&lt;ref name=Lums/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;612&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lumsdaine A.A; May M.A. &amp; Hadsell R.S. 1958. Questions spliced into a film for motivational and pupil participation. In May M.A. &amp; Lumsdaine A.A. ''Learning from films''. Yale University Press, 72–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The connections between this experiment and those of Pressey were obvious. Active responses by learners and helpful feedback on the activities were now seen as critical elements in any successful system of learning. Pressey's work had been half forgotten, but it was now recognised as significant.&lt;ref&gt;Pressey's work is reprinted in Lumsdaine A.A &amp; Glaser R. (eds) 1960. ''Teaching machines and programmed learning I: a source book''. Washington D.C. National Education Association of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programmed learning arrives ==

=== What is programmed learning? ===
If so much research had already been done on learning from films, what exactly did programmed learning add? The short answer is "[[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] control", by which is broadly meant the teaching material itself. Also, in programmed learning, a complete system was proposed which included these stages:&lt;ref&gt;Adjusted from Unwin D. 1967. The changing concept of programmed material criteria for categorisation. In Tobin M.J. (ed) ''Problems and methods in programmed learning I''. National Centre for Programmed Learning, Birmingham.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leith G.O.M. 1966. Survey of programmed learning. ''Visual Education Year Book''. NCAVAE.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The aims of the course are stated in terms which are objective, and can be measured.
#A pre-test is given, or the initial behaviour is stated.
#A post-test is provided.
#The materials have been tried out and revised according to results (developmental testing).
#The materials are constructed according to a predetermined scheme (stimulus control).
#The material is arranged in appropriate steps.
#The learner has to respond actively (not necessarily overtly).
#Arrangements are made for responses to be confirmed (knowledge of results).
#The teaching medium is appropriate for the subject-matter and the students.
#The materials are self-paced or presented in a manner which suits the learner.

A helpful discussion of the different programming techniques was given by Klaus.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus D.J. 1965. An analysis of programming techniues. In Glaser R. (ed) 1965. ''Teaching machines and programmed learning II''. Washington D.C. Department of Audiovisual Instruction, National Education Association of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The two main systems of programmed learning ===
Although there were three or four other systems proposed, we discuss here the two best-known methods.

One was by [[Norman Crowder (psychologist)|Norman Crowder]], a psychologist with the [[U.S. Air Force]]. He had been asked to investigate the training of aircraft [[wikt:maintain|maintenance]] men.&lt;ref name=Derek&gt;Rowntree D. 1966. ''Basically branching''. London: Macdonald, p5 &amp; examples in text.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowder's system was to set multiple choice questions in the text, and provide feedback for each of the alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Crowder N. [1954]. ''Intrinsic programming''. U.S. Industries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowder N. 1959. Automatic tutoring by means of intrinsic programming. In Galanter E.H. (ed) ''Automatic teaching: the state of the art''. New York: Wiley, 109{{ndash}}116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowder Norman A. 1960. Automatic tutoring by intrinsic programming. In Lumsdaine A.A &amp; Glaser R. (eds) 1960. ''Teaching machines and programmed learning I: a source book''. Washington D.C. National Education Association of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this method show that the alternatives offered in questions were chosen to cover mistakes which students were likely to make.&lt;ref name=Sue&gt;Markle S.M. 1969. ''Good frames and bad: a grammar of frame writing''. 2nd ed, New York: Wiley, Chapters 1 &amp; 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Derek/&gt; Crowder's system, which he called "intrinsic programming", was better known as "branching programming" on account of its multiple-choice alternatives.

Much better known was the other style of programmed learning, as proposed by the [[behaviourist]] [[B.F. Skinner]]. Skinner made some very effective criticisms of traditional teaching methods.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner B.F. 1965. ''The technology of teaching''. Appleton-Century-Croft. Includes reprints of his papers on programmed learning.&lt;/ref&gt; His scheme of programmed instruction was to present the material as part of a "schedule of [[reinforcement]]" in typical behaviourist manner. The programmed text of Skinner's theory of behaviorism is the most complete example of his ideas in action.&lt;ref&gt;Holland J.G. &amp; Skinner B.F. 1961. ''The analysis of behavior''. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's system was generally called "linear programming" because its activities were placed in otherwise continuous text. Skinner was a wonderful publicist for his own ideas, as can be seen from this passage:

:"There is a simple job to be done. The task can be stated in concrete terms. The necessary techniques are known. The equipment can easily be provided. Nothing stands in the way except cultural inertia... We are on the threshold of an exciting and revolutionary period in which the scientific study of man will be put to work in man's best interests. Education must play its part. It must accept the fact that sweeping revision of educational practice is possible and inevitable...".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner B.F. 1954. The science of learning and the art of teaching. ''Harvard Educational Review'' '''24''', 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both methods were originally presented in machines, and both were later presented in book form. Both systems were to an extent student centered. They were ways of teaching individual learners who worked at their own pace. Both systems (in different ways) used knowledge of results to promote learning.&lt;ref name=Lums/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p619&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annett J. 1964. The role of knowledge of results in learning: a survey. In ''Educational Technology'', De Cecco (ed), Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 279{{ndash}}285.&lt;/ref&gt; In both systems the content was pre-tested to identify problems and iron them out. Both systems emphasised clear learning objectives. Progress in learning was measured by pre- and post-tests of equivalent difficulty. Many practical tests showed the effectiveness of these methods.&lt;ref&gt;Glaser R. (ed) 1965. ''Teaching machines and programmed learning II: data and directions''. Washington D.C. National Education Association of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later effects ==
Many of these ideas were picked up and used in other educational fields, such as [[open learning]] (see the [[Open University]]) and [[computer-assisted learning]].&lt;ref name="Pritchard-24"&gt;Pritchard, Alan 2009. ''Ways of learning: learning theories and learning styles in the classroom''. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2nd ed. {{ISBN|978-0-415-46608-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rowntree D. 1990. ''Teaching through self-instruction: how to develop open learning material''. London: Kogan Page, 2nd ed. {{ISBN|1-85091-957-7}}; USA: {{ISBN|0-89397-356-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programmed learning ideas  influenced the [[Children's Television Workshop]], which did the [[R&amp;D]] for ''[[Sesame Street]]''. The use of developmental testing was absolutely characteristic of programmed learning. The division of the individual programs into small chunks is also a feature of programmed learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, Gerald S. 1974. ''Children and television: lessons from Sesame Street''. New York: Vintage Books. {{ISBN|0-394-71448-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisch, Shalom M. &amp; Bernstein, Lewis 2001. Formative research revealed: methodological and process issues in formative research". In Fisch, Shalom M. &amp; Truglio, Rosemarie T. (eds) ''"G" is for Growing: thirty years of research on children and Sesame Street''. Mahweh, New Jersey: Erlbaum, 40. {{ISBN|0-8058-3395-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more is this true of ''[[Blue's Clues]]''.&lt;ref name=Tracy&gt;Tracy, Diane. 2002. ''Blue's Clues for success: the 8 secrets behind a phenomenal business''. New York: Kaplan Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7931-5376-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Anderson, Daniel R. ''et al'' 2000. Researching Blue's Clues: viewing behavior and impact. ''Media Psychology'' '''2''' (2): 179–194. doi:10.1207/S1532785XMEP0202 4&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike ''Sesame Street'', which tested a third of its episodes,&lt;ref name=Gladwell&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm 2000. ''The tipping point: how little things can make a big difference''. New York: Little, Brown, 125/7. {{ISBN|0-316-31696-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Blue's Clues'' research team field tested every episode three times with children aged between two and six in preschool environments such as [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] programs, public schools, and private day care centers. There were three phases of testing: content evaluation, video evaluations, and content analysis.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;182&lt;/sup&gt; Their tests of the pilot, conducted throughout New York City with over 100 children aged from three to seven,&lt;ref name=Tracy/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; showed that the attention and comprehension of young viewers increased with each repeat viewing.&lt;ref name=Gladwell/&gt;

== Learning or training? ==
The terms "programmed learning" and "programmed training" were interchangeable, because the principles and methods were almost identical.&lt;ref&gt;Glaser, Robert 1964. Implications of training research for education. In Hilgard E.R. (ed) ''Theories of learning and instruction: the 63rd yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education''. NSSE, p153/181.&lt;/ref&gt; If the target audience was industrial or military, researchers used the term programmed training, because training budgets supported the work. But in schools and colleges, the work was often described as programmed learning.

Many accounts used either or both terms according to which interest was paying for the work. Sometimes researchers used both terms as explicit alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Lumsdaine A.A. 1964. Educational technology, programmed learning and instructional science. In Hilgard E.R. (ed) ''Theories of learning and instruction: the 63rd yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education''. NSSE, p382.&lt;/ref&gt; Some surveys standardised on using just one of the terms.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson L.F. &amp; Komoski P.K. School use of programmed instruction; and Shoemaker H.A. &amp; Holt H.O. The use of programmed instruction in industry. In Glaser R. (ed) 1965. ''Teaching machines and programmed learning II: data and directions''. Washington D.C. National Education Association of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the only distinction was the way the "terminal behaviours" (the final test demonstrating what the learner had learnt) were arrived at. In training, the goals were decided by a process called [[task analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Robert B. 1962. Analysis and specification of behavior for training. In Glaser R. (ed) ''Training research and education''. New York: Wiley, 31–63.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[critical incident technique]]. This was based on the key activities which a trained person should be able to do. In educational work, deciding on the terminal test was not so securely grounded. One school of thought, probably the majority, decided to turn the rather vague statements of educational aims into full-fledged behavioural statements of the kind "At the end of this program, students should be able to do the following...".&lt;ref&gt;Popham W.J. &amp; Baker E.L. 1970. ''Establishing instructional goals''. Englewood Cliffs NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; A pamphlet by [[Robert Mager]] was influential because it showed how to do this.&lt;ref&gt;Mager, Robert F. 1962. ''Preparing instructional objectives''. Palo Alto CA: Fearon; 1997 edition by  Atlanta, GA: The Center for Effective Performance. {{ISBN|1879618036}}&lt;/ref&gt; This worked well with some subject matters, but had its limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald-Ross M. 1973. Behavioural objectives – a critical review. ''Instructional Science'' '''2''', 1–52.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, educators have reservations as to how far a list of behaviours captures what they are trying to teach. Subjects differ greatly in their basic aims, but where programmed learning suited a topic, most field trials gave positive results.

== Examples ==
''Daily Oral Language'' and the ''[[Saxon (teaching method)|Saxon method]]'', a math programme, are specific implementations of programmed instruction which have an emphasis on repetition.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Susan J. (2003) ''Blueprint for student success: a guide to research-based teaching practices, K-12'' Corwin Press, Thousand Oaks, California, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CTvgSf2H8GQC&amp;pg=PA105 page 105], {{ISBN|0-7619-4697-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known books using programmed learning include the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]/[[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] text ''The Little Schemer''&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Daniel and Felleisen, Matthias (1996) ''The Little Schemer'' MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, {{ISBN|0-262-56099-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''[[Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Bobby Fischer|Fischer, Bobby]]; Margulies, Stuart and Mosenfelder, Donn (1966) ''Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess'' Bantam Books, New York, {{ISBN|0-553-26315-3}}; and various editions since&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Laplace Transform Solution Of Differential Equations: A Programmed Text'', by Robert D. Strum and John R. Ward of the [[Naval Postgraduate School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strum|first1=Robert D.|last2=Ward|first2=John R.|title=Laplace Transform Solution Of Differential Equations: A Programmed Text|date=1968|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=9780135228050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several available foreign language reading textbooks also use programmed learning. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tatham|first1=Karl C. Sandberg, Eddison C.|title=French for reading|date=1972|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=9780133316032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wendel|first1=John R.|last2=Sandberg|first2=Karl C.|title=German for reading : a programmed approach for graduate and undergraduate reading courses|date=1973|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=9780133540192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franco|first1=Fabiola|last2=Sandberg|first2=Karl C.|title=Spanish for reading : a self-instructional course|date=1998|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|location=Hauppauge, N.Y.|isbn=9780764103339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruth Behar''' (born 1956) is a [[Cuban-American]] [[anthropologist]] and writer.&lt;ref name="msuBio"&gt;[http://specialcollections.lib.msu.edu/html/materials/collections/michcoll/behar.htm Ruth Behar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609060537/http://specialcollections.lib.msu.edu/html/materials/collections/michcoll/behar.htm |date=2010-06-09 }} Michigan Writers Collection&lt;/ref&gt; Her work includes academic studies, as well as poetry, memoir, and literary fiction. As an anthropologist, she has argued for the open adoption and acknowledgement of the subjective nature of research and participant-observers.

==Life and work==
Behar was born in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] in 1956 to a Jewish-Cuban family of Sephardic Turkish, and Ashkenazi Polish and Russian ancestry. She was four when her family immigrated to the US following [[Fidel Castro]]'s gaining power in the revolution of 1959. More than 94% of Cuban Jews left the country at that time.,&lt;ref name="virtual"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Cuba.html "Cuba"], Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; together with many others of the middle and upper classes. Behar attended local schools and studied as an undergraduate at [[Wesleyan University]], receiving her B.A. in 1977. She studied [[cultural anthropology]] at [[Princeton University]], earning her doctorate in 1983.

She travels regularly to Cuba and Mexico to study aspects of culture, as well as to investigate her family's roots in Jewish Cuba. She has specialized in studying the lives of women in developing societies.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Ruth|url=http://www.ruthbehar.com/AboutRuth.htm|publisher=Ruthbehar.com|date=April 24, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227051724/http://www.ruthbehar.com/AboutRuth.htm|archivedate=February 27, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991 her research and writing have largely focused on her native country, Cuba, which she left at the age of four; her parents had family that had been there since the 1920s. Her research on the dwindling Jewish community in Cuba is also the focus of her film, ''[[Adio Kerida]]'' (2002). It featured camera work and editing by her son Gabriel Frye-Behar.

Behar is a professor at the Department of Anthropology at the [[University of Michigan]] in Ann Arbor.&lt;ref name="msuBio" /&gt; Her literary work is featured in the [[Michigan State University]]'s Michigan Writers Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.msu.edu/branches/vvl/writers/index.jsp |title=Michigan Writers Series |publisher=Michigan State University Libraries |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer of anthropology, essays, poetry and fiction, Behar focuses on issues related to women and feminism.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

Her personal life experiences as a Jewish Cuban-American woman are frequently an important part of her writing. Her dissertation (1983), based on her first fieldwork in northern [[Spain]], became the basis for her first book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://core.ecu.edu/engl/deenas/Caribbean/RuthBehar.htm "Ruth Behar"], Writers of the Caribbean&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second book, ''Translated Woman'' (1993), was based on ten years of fieldwork in a rural town in [[Mexico]]. Her book, ''The Vulnerable Observer: Anthropology That Breaks Your Heart,'' examines the role that the personal can play in [[ethnography|ethnographic writing]] and generated controversy. Jewish Cuba is the topic of her book, ''An Island Called Home: Returning to Jewish Cuba'' (2007), as well as her latest book, ''Traveling Heavy: A Memoir in between Journeys'' (2013).

=== ''Lucky Broken Girl'' ===
''Lucky Broken Girl'' (2017) is multicultural coming-of-age novel for young adults, based on the author's childhood in the 1960s.
Ruthie Mizrahi and her family recently emigrated from Castro's Cuba to New York City. Just when she's finally beginning to gain confidence in her mastery of English –and enjoying her reign as her neighborhood's hopscotch queen – a horrific car accident leaves her in a body cast and confined to her bed for a long recovery. As Ruthie's world shrinks because of her inability to move, her powers of observation and her heart grow larger and she comes to understand how fragile life is, how vulnerable we all are as human beings, and how friends, neighbors, and the power of the arts can sweeten even the worst of times. Writing for Cuba Counterpoints, Julie Schwietert Collazo writes, "Behar, without fail, always seems to be writing with the goal of honoring her own history, experiences, and feelings, without ever denying or excluding those of others, and in Lucky Broken Girl the achievement of this goal is evident on every page."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cubacounterpoints.com/archives/5189|title=Ruth Behar's Lucky Broken Girl. A review by JULIE SCHWIETERT COLLAZO|date=2017-03-07|work=Cuba Counterpoints|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Traveling Heavy'' ===
''Traveling Heavy'' (2013) is a memoir about her Cuban-American family, descended from both Askenazi and Sephardic Jews in Cuba, as well as the strangers who ease her journey in life. Her probings about her complicated Jewish Cuban ancestry and family's immigration to America explore issues about identity and belonging.&lt;ref name="kirkus"&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ruth-behar/traveling-heavy/ : Ruth Behar, ''Traveling Heavy''], ''Kirkus Reviews''&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkus Reviews described her book as "A heartfelt witness to the changing political and emotional landscape of the Cuban-American experience."&lt;ref name="kirkus"/&gt; Behar studies the revitalization of Cuban Jewish life as an anthropologist, but her personal journey back to the island she left as a little girl is the heart of this "memoir I snuck in, between journeys."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/05/07/book-review-traveling-heavy-ruth-behar/63bQLREGr3TWK6bOtobcSN/story.html Review: Ruth Behar, ''Traveling Heavy'"], ''Boston Globe'', 7 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''An Island Called Home'' ===
''An Island Called Home'' (2007) was written in Behar's quest for a better understanding of Jewish Cuba and particularly her family's roots.&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;{{cite news|last=Veciana-Suarez|first=Ana|title=Author's heritage draws her back to Cuba's Jews|url=http://ruthbehar.com/ruth,%20miami,%20book%20fair,%20miami%20herald,%2011%2003%2007.pdf|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=November 3, 2007|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114230/http://ruthbehar.com/ruth,%20miami,%20book%20fair,%20miami%20herald,%2011%2003%2007.pdf|archivedate=August 26, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted, "I knew the stories of the Jews in Cuba, but it was all about looking at them as a community".&lt;ref name="heritage"/&gt; Traveling the island, Behar becomes the confidante to a host of Jewish strangers, building connections for further anthropological research. Conducting one-on-one interviews, combined with black-and-white photography, she builds readers an image of the diasporic thread connecting Cuban Jews to one another.&lt;ref name="heritage"/&gt;

Beginning with Jewish immigrants of the 1920s, who fled unrest in Turkey, Russia and Poland, she moves on to stories of later immigrants, Polish and German Jews who fled to Cuba in the 1930s and 1940s in order to escape persecution and the concentration camps of the [[Nazis]]. In Cuba immigrants opened mom-and-pop shops, peddled, and gradually adopted Spanish while still speaking [[Yiddish]], settling into Latino life in La Habana Vieja. In the early part of the century, many Jewish immigrants worked in the Cuban garment industry.&lt;ref name="virtual"/&gt; More than 94% left during and after the 1959 revolution.&lt;ref name="virtual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Island review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonfiction Review: An Island Called Home: Returning to Jewish Cuba by Ruth Behar|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8135-4189-1|publisher=''Publisher's Weekly''|date=September 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As her family was among those who left Cuba, Behar intertwines her personal thoughts and feelings with her professional, analytical observations of the current society.&lt;ref name="heritage"/&gt;

=== ''The Vulnerable Observer'' ===
''The Vulnerable Observer'' recounts Behar's passage to integrating subjective aspects into her anthropological studies. Suffering her grandfather's death while on a field trip to Spain to study funeral practices, she decided the ethnographer could never be fully detached, and needed to become a "vulnerable observer".&lt;ref name="Vulnerable review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonfiction Review: The Vulnerable Observer by Ruth Behar|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8070-4630-2|publisher=Publisher's Weekly|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that the ethnographic fieldworker should identify and work though, his or her own emotional involvement with the subject under study.&lt;ref name="Vulnerable review"/&gt; She strongly critiques conventional ideas of objectivity.&lt;ref name="DeVault"&gt;M. L. DeVault, "Book Review: Behar/'The Vulnerable Observer'," ''Contemporary Sociology,'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that the ideal of a "scientific," distanced, impersonal mode of presenting materials was incomplete.&lt;ref name="DeVault"/&gt; Other anthropologists, including [[Claude Levi-Strauss]], [[George Devereux|Georges Devereux]], and [[Clifford Geertz]], had also suggested that the researcher had to claim being part of the process more openly. Behar's six personal essays in ''The Vulnerable Observer'' are examples of her subjective approach.&lt;ref name="Vulnerable review"/&gt;

Behar's grandparents emigrated to Cuba from Russia, Poland and Turkey during the 1920s. In 1962 they fled Cuba to escape Castro's communism.&lt;ref name="DeVault"/&gt; At the age of nine, Behar suffered a broken leg from the crash of her family's car. She was immobilized for a year.&lt;ref name="Vulnerable review"/&gt; The experience and recovery period led her to the recognition that "the body is a homeland" of stored memory and pain.&lt;ref name="DeVault"/&gt;

=== ''Translated Woman'' ===
In 1985, Behar was working in Mexico when she befriended an Indian witch working as a street peddler.&lt;ref name="Translated"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonfiction Review: Translated Woman by Ruth Behar|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8070-7052-9|date=January 4, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Townspeople said the witch, Esperanza Hernandez, had used black magic to blind her ex-husband after he regularly beat her and then left her for his mistress.&lt;ref name="Translated"/&gt; Behar's portrayal of Esperanza's story in ''Translated Woman'' suggests she alienated her own mother, inspiring Behar to portray Esperanza as a feminist heroine.&lt;ref name="Translated"/&gt; Esperanza claims she found redemption in a spiritualist cult constructed around Pancho Villa. She blamed pent-up rage about her husband and life as the reason for the deaths in infancy of the first six of her 12 children.&lt;ref name="Translated"/&gt; Esperanza's rage led her to beat up her husband's lover, throw her son out of the house, beat a daughter for refusing to support her, and disown another son for having an affair with an uncle's ex-mistress because she considered it to be incestuous.&lt;ref name="Translated"/&gt; Behar reflects on her own life and begins to think that her Latina-gringa conflicts result from a feeling of loss after having tried to model herself according to the American Dream, thus losing some sense of her Cuban Jewish family's past in that island nation.&lt;ref name="Sanchez"&gt;B. Sanchez, "Book Review: 'Translated Woman'," ''Hispanic Magazine,'' 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Esperanza's odyssey examines physical borders, margins and separations.&lt;ref name="Sanchez"/&gt; ''Translated Woman'' contributes to the feminist argument that studying women in anthropology has been undervalued due to traditional academic prejudices that view women-centered analysis as too personally biased.&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;E. Perez, "Book Review: Behar/Translated Woman," ''Journal of American History,'' September 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
*In 1988, Behar was the first Latino woman to be awarded a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur fellowship]]. *In 2011 she gave a Turku [[Agora Lecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboagora.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/agora-lecture-%E2%80%93-ruth-behar-the-death-of-the-angel/|title=Agora Lecture – Ruth Behar: The Death of the Angel|date=14 November 2011|website=wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''School fees''' in [[New Zealand]] is a term referring to monetary payments by parents or guardians to their child's school.

In state and state-integrated schools, "school fees" is most commonly used to describe a request from schools to parents or guardians for a donation (usually annual) to their child's school. Although this payment is entirely voluntary, some school boards use terms such as "Fees", "School Levy" or "Parental Contribution" to coerce payment from parents. The [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]] direction from its 1998-25 Fees Circular to school Boards advises that terms to imply that payment of the sum is compulsory should not be used, particularly "fee" or "levy". Instead, the term "'''School Donation'''" is suggested.

State and state-integrated schools can charge Activity Fees for items above and beyond the curriculum, but payment of the donation is voluntary.

In state-integrated schools, there is a compulsory fee called "Attendance Dues". Schools have to report their attendance dues to the Ministry of Education, where any changes to the dues are monitored.  Attendance dues are payable for upkeep of the school land and buildings, which unlike in state schools are privately owned by proprietors, such as the Catholic Church in the case of a Catholic school. While school donations are voluntary like in state schools, parents/guardians are contractually and legally required to pay attendance dues, and proprietors can take action against parents or even cancel the enrolment of the child over unpaid attendance dues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.co.nz/act/public/1975/0129/latest/DLM437585.html#DLM437585 |title= 36 Attendance dues -- Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975 No 129 (as at 03 September 2007) -- New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |date= 3 September 2007 |accessdate= 15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right to free primary and secondary education==
{{See also|Education in New Zealand}}
Section 3 of the Education Act 1989 states the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM177440.html |title= Section 3, Education Act 1989 No 80 (as at 14 July 2017) -- New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |accessdate= 27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text="Except as provided in this Act, every person who is not an international student is entitled to free enrolment and free education at any State school or partnership school kura hourua during the period beginning on the person’s fifth birthday and ending on 1 January after the person’s 19th birthday."}}

The act defines an international student as anyone who is not a [[New Zealand nationality law|New Zealand citizen]] or the holder of a New Zealand residence class visa. By virtue of the [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]], Australian citizens and residents are automatically awarded a residence class visa on entry into New Zealand, so are not classified as international students. There are additional circumstances in which students are not classified as international students, such as children of refugees and foreign diplomats in New Zealand.

This means as long as the student is a domestic student, parents and/or legal guardians do not have to pay for things such as;
*the cost of tuition or materials used in the provision of the curriculum,
*the cost of heat, lighting or water,
*the cost of providing information about enrolling at the school,
*interviews when parents are seeking to enrol students at a school.

===BYO Devices===
On 26 March 2017, the NZ Herald reported that the Ministry of Education was set to remind schools that they can’t enforce bring your own devices on parents. Ministry of Education deputy secretary Katrina Casey was quoted as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
″Compulsory BYOD policies breached provisions in the Education Act guaranteeing a "free education" at state and partnership schools for all children from age 5 to 19.″

″We will be reminding all schools that boards of trustees can ask, but can't compel, families to bring their own digital devices because schools can't deny a child's access to learning if their parents can't provide them one. In these cases, boards need to provide access to a school device. No child's learning should ever be disadvantaged by a lack of access to technology.″&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11820965&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Delivery of the curriculum==
The Government provides funding for teacher salaries, operational grants and supplementary grants to pay for the running of state and state-integrated schools and the delivery of the curriculum, so schools may only charge parents for things that fall outside of the curriculum.

==Activity fees==

Schools can ask for, but not ''insist on'', payment of fees for activities that fall outside the curriculum or have a "take home component", at the beginning of the year. Schools can not make payment in advance a condition of enrolment and must ensure that learning is not impacted through non-payment for any reason, as Section 3 of the Education Act guarantees free enrolment.

The Ministry suggests that;
*schools provide a "pay as you go" option so that parents do not pay in advance for things such as class trips that a sick child may not ultimately attend.
*schools itemize their fees so that parents can choose which activities they want their children to participate in.
*schools inform parents at the beginning of the year of the materials charge for subjects such as clothing and woodwork.

Notably the Ministry of Education (1998-25) advises that it is inappropriate for activity fees to cover student workbooks (textbooks that students write in) and photocopying.  Activity fees are a 'goods and service' so attract GST. The operation of activity fees is described in cases below.

===School camps===
If an Outdoor Education Camp is part of the curriculum of a particular course at school, then the school may not charge for it. However they can charge for food and transport to the camp.

If parents are unable or unwilling to pay for a school camp that is not part of the curriculum, or for food and transport to one that is, then the school should provide activities that will be an "appropriate alternative" for the children who do not go to the camp.

===School projects===
Schools may charge for materials in classes such as woodwork and design when the student is able to take the finished project home. But the school should not force students to take the project home just so they can be charged for it. If a high cost project is being planned a lower cost alternative should also be provided.

===Photocopying===
Schools cannot charge for photocopying except in exceptional cases. In most cases the teacher handing out photocopied materials is an integral part of the delivery of the Curriculum.  Schools cannot charge for textbooks or workbooks unless the student is allowed to keep the book.

===Programmes in English for speakers of other languages===
If the school is being funded by the Ministry or some other institution to provide these programmes then it cannot charge students to attend. A school may charge for unfunded programmes but it cannot compel parents to enrol their students in them.

===Special Education Programmes===
Special Education Programmes are usually funded through the Ongoing Resourcing Scheme, Specialist Education Services, or the Special Education Grant so schools can not charge for these programmes.

===STAR Courses===
Schools are funded by the Ministry to provide these courses. Unless there is a "take home component" of the course, students cannot be charged for STAR courses.

===Reading Recovery Programme===
The Reading Recovery Programme is part of the curriculum and there can be no charge for it.

===NCEA fees===
Secondary schools collect fees on behalf of the [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority]] (NZQA) for the cost of administering the [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement]] (NCEA), the main secondary school qualification in New Zealand. The fee is $76.70 per year, although it can be reduced to $20 for those with a [[Community Services Card]] (this includes all beneficiaries) or have three or more children completing NCEA, and must be paid by 1 September, otherwise the fee increases to $126.70, with no financial assistance possible, and must be paid to NZQA directly.

Because NCEA is part of the Year 11 to 13 curriculum, it is free for students to study for and sit the exams. However, any qualification gained will not be awarded until the fees are paid.

==Enrolment fees==
On 27 February 2016 the New Zealand Herald reported that Auckland Grammar School and Cornwall Park District School requested a payment from parents to participate in the ballot for out-of-zone places.

This resulted in the Ministry of Education issuing an Auckland-wide "critical reminder" to remind principals that they are not allowed to charge for participation in the ballots.

The reminder stated "Administering a ballot for out-of-zone students is considered part of the normal activity of school staff"

Katrina Casey, of the Ministry of Education, also stated that: 
"We have written to Auckland Grammar School and Cornwall Park District School to explain no payment connected with enrolment could be sought from parents and that schools cannot charge a ballot application fee, or make a fee a condition of enrolment,".
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11596401]&lt;/ref&gt;

==School donations==

Many schools request a school donation.  It is voluntary, tax-deductible for parents, and does not attract GST.  Schools state that the school donation is needed to bridge the gap between the costs of delivering quality learning over and above what the Government funds.

Schools typically use the funding to top-up the Operational Grant.  Funds are tagged for items attractive to parents - e.g. additional teachers/small class sizes, ICT, or other learning resources, but as they are counted as income for operational matters in reality donations are indistinguishable from other operational grant expenditure, including any staff funded by the Board of Trustees.

The Government provides a higher Operations Grant for low decile schools because the decile represents the school community's socio-economic rank.  As they get less Government funding, and because parents have more ability to pay, high decile schools typically request a larger donation.

On 10 May 2013, the NZ Herald reported that in 2012 parents raised "more than $357 million a year in donations and fundraising to support the "free" schooling system."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11252604]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Payment of donations==

Wellington College, a decile 10 school, charges $720 per student and $250 for each sibling each year for "extras" such as sports gear and computers, and the headmaster Roger Moses has admitted that it is powerless to act against the quarter of parents who refused to pay. Auckland Grammar deputy headmaster Wayne Moore said only 65 per cent of parents paid and his school would introduce a $250 "compulsory fee" in 2008 for technology subjects. The Rector of  Palmerston North Boys' High School (decile 9), Tim O'Connor said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We have parents who simply don't pay, believing that we have a totally free education system, which is generally supported by what the ministry tells parents."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and that his school was considering hiring a full-time commercial manager to raise the extra $1.5 million a year it needed to operate.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_37672"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz//37672 |title=Free education 'it's a myth' |date=27 October 2007 |author=Nichols, Lane |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Feilding High School allegedly named students in school assembly, sent students home and restricted access to classes, because their parents had not paid subject fees. The Ministry of Education said in a media release that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... a school has the right to pursue the payment of legitimate charges. It has access to the same debt recovery processes as any other organisation. Parents are required to pay any legitimate charges that have been agreed with the school in the same manner that they are required to pay their power and phone bills.

However, Mr Matheson also said that a school cannot use students as a lever in debt recovery. A school has no right to restrict access to classes, or send students home, or to shame students as a device to force their parents to pay. The issue of the claimed debt is between the school and parents.

Because school attendance is compulsory for students it is unethical for a school to use its relationship with students in this manner.

Failure to ensure the well-being of all students at the school could result in the ministry using its statutory powers to intervene in the operation of the school board. The ministry has the power to appoint a specialist adviser to the board, or a limited statutory manager to manage student well-being, or a commissioner to run the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minedu.govt.nz/theMinistry/AboutUs/mediaCentreLanding/mediaReleaseIndex2007/MR005Feb1307.aspx Ministry response to issues at Feilding High School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

School Trustees Association head Ray Newport says fewer parents have been paying the donation in recent years. At some schools the percentage is as low as 20% and even at the highest-decile schools, many parents opt out.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_226105"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/226105 |title=Cash-strapped schools call in heavies to collect donations |date=20 January 2008 |work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]] |accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withholding school reports===

School Boards cannot withhold school reports or leaving certificates until the Activity Fees, School Donation or any other charges have been paid as the National Education Guidelines state that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Each Board, through the principal and staff, will be required to...report on student progress
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schools must also obey Section 5 of the Official Information Act 1982

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The question whether any official information is to be made available, where that question arises under this Act, shall be determined, except where this Act otherwise expressly requires, in accordance with the purposes of this Act and the principle that the information shall be made available unless there is good reason for withholding it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And Section 6, Principle 6(1) of the Privacy Act 1993

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Where an agency holds personal information in such a way that it can readily be retrieved, the individual concerned shall be entitled...to have access to that information.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Surcharges and Withholding Privileges===

On 29 May 2013, the NZ Herald reported that [[Avondale College, Auckland|Avondale College]] would not allow a student who had not made a donation to attend the school ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10886912| title=Fee scrap: Girl banned from ball| date=29 May 2013| first=Nicholas| last=Jones| newspaper=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

on 2 June 2013, the NZ Herald also reported that [[Macleans College]] added surcharges to ball and graduation dinner tickets, sports, drama and dance activities, and fees for Cambridge International exams if a student had not made a donation. The NZ Herald also stated that Macleans College was being investigated and according to the Ministry of Education the practice was unlawful.

Ministry of Education spokeswoman Katrina Casey said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
she would seek assurances from Macleans College that:
- Any unlawful charging of fees will cease.
- Students will not have privileges withheld because of non-payment of donations.
- There will be no coercion to pay donations
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Principal Byron Bentley was quoted as saying: "We beg to differ that these charges are unlawful - we had our lawyers look at this years ago".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10887879| title=School defends surcharges| first=Kirsty| last=Wynn| date=2 June 2013| newspaper=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2013, Seek.co.nz reported that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 2010, [[Karamu High School]] in Hastings was reprimanded after advising a parent that her daughter could not buy a ball ticket or order a school-leaver's jersey until donation money was paid. The threat was withdrawn after the ministry became involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/8238082/Threats-and-ploys-to-get-voluntary-fees| title=Threats and ploys to get voluntary fees| first=Jody| last=O'Callaghan| date=30 January 2013| newspaper=The Dominion Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Tax status of the school donation==
As School Donations are voluntary contributions, schools do not have to pay [[Goods and Services Tax (New Zealand)|GST]] on the money they collect. New Zealand tax residents can claim 33.33 percent of the donation back through the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]], by filing a ''Tax credit claim form'' (IR 526) with the donation receipt attached after the end of the tax year (i.e. 31 March) in which the donation was made.

Schools that withhold items or activities that are fully funded by the school donation, such as the school magazine, are threatening the tax status of their School Donations. The Ministry states that this action...
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...implies that the school donation is not a voluntary donation at all but, at least in part, is a payment for goods and services. This may mean that all school parents would be unable to claim an income tax rebate on their "donation" and the board would have to pay GST on all the money it collected by way of school "donations". Furthermore, withholding an item can have other consequences eg if the student ID card is used as a swipe card to enable students to borrow library books, to withhold the card from students whose parents have not paid the school donation would have the effect of denying the student a privilege that is available to other students. (It is also worth remembering that the library building has been provided by Government and most of the books will have been purchased with operational funding.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Debt collection by schools==

On 20 January 2008, ''[[The Sunday Star-Times]]'' printed an article entitled ''Cash-strapped schools call in heavies to collect donations'' by Catherine Woulfe.

The article claims that debt collector [[Baycorp]] says that it has contacted "a handful" of parents on behalf of state schools to pay school donations. It further claims that community law advisory group [[YouthLaw]] has received calls from parents who have been chased by debt collectors because they have chosen not to pay school donations.

Secondary Principals' Association head Arthur Graves, principal of Greymouth High School says he would never use a debt collector to chase school fees, but knows of others doing so.

Minister of Education, Chris Carter said coercing parents to pay donations was illegal and
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I would not tolerate any New Zealand school breaking the law. I would certainly intervene if parents approached me and I would urge them to do so... Parents are to email or telephone my office if a school has done that".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article also claims that [[YouthLaw]] has heard from students whose families have not paid the donation who have been banned from school balls or trips, or not given the leaving certificates needed for entry into university or other tertiary institutions.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_226105"/&gt;

==Size of school donation==

On 14 February 2009, ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' ran an article entitled "''Parents asked to dig even deeper''" &lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10556663"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10556663 |title=School donations: Parents asked to dig even deeper |author=Smith, Jacqueline |date=14 February 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which was based on the results of a survey of Secondary schools in its distribution area. The results for a selection of Auckland secondary schools are as follows:

In addition to the above, the results of a 2012 web search for "school donation" shows that primary school donations are lower, and the link to the decile socio-economic rating means the donation requested is higher in high decile schools:

The British scientist [[James Smithson]] (1765–1829) left most of his wealth to his nephew Henry James Hungerford. When Hungerford died childless in 1835,&lt;ref name=nephewdead&gt;{{cite book|last=Goode|first=George Brown|title=The Smithsonian Institution, 1846–1896, The History of Its First Half Century.|year=1897|publisher=De Vinne Press|location=Washington, D.C.|page=25|url=http://siris-sihistory.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=133GO29212E47.369&amp;profile=sicall&amp;source=~!sichronology&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!464~!16&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=power&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=smithson+james&amp;index=.SW&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=power&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1&amp;limitbox_1=LO01+=+sch&amp;ultype=.YW&amp;uloper=%3C&amp;ullimit=1966}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the estate passed "to the United States of America, to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an Establishment for the increase &amp; diffusion of knowledge among men", in accordance with Smithson's will.&lt;ref name=will&gt;{{cite web|title=James Smithson – Founder of the Smithsonian, Last Will and Testament|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/documents/smithsonwill.htm|work=Smithsonian Scrapbook: Letters, Diaries and Photographs from the Smithsonian Archives|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=October 4, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824051624/http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/documents/smithsonwill.htm|archivedate=August 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress officially accepted the legacy bequeathed to the nation, and pledged the faith of the United States to the charitable trust on July 1, 1836.&lt;ref name=foundingfactsheet&gt;{{cite web|title=Founding of the Smithsonian Institution|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/founding-smithsonian-institution|work=Fact Sheets, Smithsonian Newsdesk|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=October 4, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901160155/http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/founding-smithsonian-institution|archivedate=September 1, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American diplomat [[Richard Rush]] was dispatched to England by President [[Andrew Jackson]] to collect the bequest. Rush returned in August 1838 with 105 sacks containing 104,960 [[gold sovereign]]s (about $500,000 at the time, which is {{Inflation|US|500000|1838|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref&gt;Heather Ewing, ''The Lost World of James Smithson: Science, Revolution, and the Birth of the Smithsonian'', pp. 323–24, 330, 409. Ewing notes that it would be the equivalent of over $10 million today, using one index, but using a per-capita share of GDP, it would be the equivalent of over $220 million. It was close to the total of [[Harvard University]]'s endowment at that point, which had accumulated for nearly 200 years by the 1830s and was not the result of a single gift, as Smithson's was.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gardens&gt;{{cite book|last=Ottesen|first=Carole|title=A Guide to Smithsonian Gardens|year=2011|publisher=Smithsonian Books|isbn=978-1-58834-300-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the money was in hand, eight years of Congressional haggling ensued over how to interpret Smithson's rather vague mandate "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge."&lt;ref name="foundingfactsheet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gardens" /&gt;  Unfortunately, the money was invested by the US Treasury in bonds issued by the state of Arkansas which soon defaulted.  After heated debate, Massachusetts Representative (and ex-President) [[John Quincy Adams]] persuaded Congress to restore the lost funds with interest&lt;ref&gt;"Smithsonian Information Brochure", Smithsonian Visitor Information and Associates' Reception Center, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and, despite designs on the money for other purposes, convinced his colleagues to preserve it for an institution of science and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Paul (1999). "John Quincy Adams: A Public Life, a Private Life". Harvard University Press. p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, on August 10, 1846, President [[James K. Polk]] signed the legislation that established the Smithsonian Institution as a trust instrumentality of the United States, to be administered by a Board of Regents and a Secretary of the Smithsonian.&lt;ref name="foundingfactsheet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{usstat|9|102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums and buildings===
The [[Smithsonian Institution Building]] ("the Castle") began construction in 1849. Designed by architect [[James Renwick Jr.]], its interiors were completed by general contractor Gilbert Cameron. The building opened in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=66000867}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination: Smithsonian Institution Building|last=Morton|first=W. Brown III|date=February 8, 1971|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smithsonian's first expansion came with construction of the [[Arts and Industries Building]] in 1881. Congress had promised to build a new structure for the museum if the 1876 [[Philadelphia Centennial Exposition]] generated enough income. It did, and the building was designed by architects [[Adolf Cluss]] and Paul Schulze, based on original plans developed by [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Montgomery C. Meigs]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]. It opened in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=71000994}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination: Arts and Industries Building of the Smithsonian Institution|last=Norton|first=W. Brown III|date=April 6, 1971|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]] opened in 1889 to accommodate the Smithsonian's Department of Living Animals.&lt;ref name="siarchives.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/pictures/national-zoological-park |title=National Zoological Park |work=Smithsonian Institution Archives |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111025911/http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/pictures/national-zoological-park |archivedate=November 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The park was designed by landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]].&lt;ref name="siarchives.si.edu" /&gt;

The [[National Museum of Natural History]] opened in June 1911 to similarly accommodate the Smithsonian's United States National Museum, which had previously been housed in the Castle and then the Arts and Industries Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/about/history.htm | title=Museum History | publisher=National  Museum of Natural History | year=2008 | accessdate=2009-11-15 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726053347/https://www.mnh.si.edu/about/history.htm | archivedate=July 26, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This structure was designed by the D.C. architectural firm of [[Hornblower &amp; Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Museum Plans."

When [[Detroit]] [[philanthropist]] [[Charles Lang Freer]] donated his private collection to the Smithsonian and funds to build the museum to hold it (which was named the [[Freer Gallery]]), it was among the Smithsonian's first major donations from a private individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, Arthur M.

The center is a division of the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latino.si.edu/PDF/2007/YAP_PR_6.26.07.pdf|title=Smithsonian Latino Center's Young Ambassadors Arrive for Week of Cultural Programs in Washington, D.C.|last=Lara|first=Isabel|date=2007-06-26|website=Smithsonian Institution|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050238/http://latino.si.edu/PDF/2007/YAP_PR_6.26.07.pdf|archivedate=February 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2016, the center is run by an executive director, Eduardo Díaz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latino.si.edu/About/Staff|title=Smithsonian Latino Center Staff|website=latino.si.edu|access-date=2016-05-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611141733/http://latino.si.edu/About/Staff|archivedate=June 11, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
At the time of its creation, the Smithsonian Institution had other entities dedicated to other minority groups: National Museum of the American Indian, Freer-Sackler Gallery for Asian Arts and Culture, African Art Museum, and the National Museum of African-American Heritage and Culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/documents/smithsonian/OlearyIGdeclaration.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216085038/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/documents/smithsonian/OlearyIGdeclaration.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of the center was prompted, in part, by the publishing of a report called "Willful Neglect: The Smithsonian and U.S. Latinos".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to documents obtained by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', when former Latino Center executive director [[Pilar O'Leary]] first took the job, the center faced employees who had "serious performance issues". No performance plans existed for the staff and unfulfilled financial obligations to sponsors existed. The website's quality was poor, and the center did not have a public affairs manager, a programs director, adequate human resources support, or cohesive mission statement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After difficult times in the first few years, the center improved. According to the Smithsonian, the center "support[s] scholarly research, exhibitions, public and educational programs, web-based content and virtual platforms, and collections and archives. [It] also manage[s] leadership and professional development programs for Latino youth, emerging scholars and museum professionals."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today, the website features a high-tech virtual museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latino.si.edu/LVM|title=Smithsonian Latino Virtual Museum|website=latino.si.edu|access-date=2016-05-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510114004/http://latino.si.edu/LVM|archivedate=May 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Young Ambassadors Program====
The Smithsonian Latino Center's Young Ambassadors Program (YAP) is a program within the Latino Center that reaches out to Latino high school students with the goal of encouraging them to become leaders in arts, sciences, and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latino.si.edu/Education/YAP|title=Young Ambassadors Program|website=latino.si.edu|access-date=2016-05-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510115706/http://latino.si.edu/Education/YAP|archivedate=May 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students selected for the program travel to Washington, D.C. for an "enrichment seminar" that lasts approximately five days. Afterwards, students return to their communities to serve in a paid, one-month internship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Pilar O'Leary launched the program when she served as executive director of the Smithsonian Latino Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/washingtonlife/docs/holiday_2006__100mb_/80|title=Con Sabor!|last=|first=|date=2006|work=Washington Life Magazine "Substance and Style" Issue|access-date=2016-05-18|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616154819/https://issuu.com/washingtonlife/docs/holiday_2006__100mb_/80|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Latino Center, O'Leary told the press in 2007: "Our goal is to help our Young Ambassadors become the next generation of leaders in the arts and culture fields. This program encourages students to be proud of their roots and learn more about their cultural heritage to inspire them to educate the public in their own communities about how Latinos are enriching America's cultural fabric."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Publications==
The Institution publishes ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' magazine monthly and ''[[Air &amp; Space]]'' magazine bimonthly. 
''Smithsonian'' was the result of Secretary of the Smithsonian [[S. Dillon Ripley]] asking the retired editor of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine [[Edward K. Thompson]] to produce a magazine "about things in which the Smithsonian Institution is interested, might be interested or ought to be interested."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Noxious_Bogs__Amorous_Elephants.html |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130202154607/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Noxious_Bogs__Amorous_Elephants.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2013-02-02 |title= Noxious Bogs &amp; Amorous Elephants: Smithsonian's birth, 35 years ago, only hinted at the splendors to follow |last= Winfrey |first= Carey |publisher= Smithsonian |date= October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Secretary of the Smithsonian, Walter Boyne, founded ''Air &amp; Space.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Pelican Publishing| isbn = 978-1-4556-1335-9| last = D| first = Walker, Paul| title = Truman's Dilemma: Invasion Or the Bomb| date = 2010-09-23}}{{rp|269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Pelican Publishing Company, Inc.| isbn = 978-1-4556-1568-1| last = Boyne| first = Walter| title = How the Helicopter Changed Modern Warfare| date = 2011-03-04}}{{rp|353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
[[File:Smithsonian Castle Doorway.jpg|thumb|upright|The Smithsonian Castle doorway]]
The Smithsonian Institution was established as a [[Trust (property)|trust]] instrumentality by act of Congress.&lt;ref name="Stam"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stam|first=David H.|title=International Dictionary of Library Histories, Volume 1 &amp; 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=APtYCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA702|accessdate=4 September 2016|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1-136-77785-1|page=702|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416054300/https://books.google.com/books?id=APtYCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA702|archivedate=April 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than two-thirds of the Smithsonian's workforce of some 6,300 persons are employees of the federal government. The Smithsonian Office of Protection Services oversees security at the Smithsonian facilities and enforces laws and regulations for [[National Capital Parks]] together with the [[United States Park Police]].

The President's 2011 budget proposed just under $800 million in support for the Smithsonian, slightly increased from previous years.  Institution exhibits are free of charge, though in 2010 the [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform|Deficit Commission]] recommended admission fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/Illustrative_List_11.10.2010.pdf |title=$200 BILLION IN ILLUSTRATIVE SAVINGS |publisher=FiscalCommission.gov |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119153741/http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/Illustrative_List_11.10.2010.pdf |archivedate=November 19, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-responds-deficit-commission-s-recommendation-admission-fees |title=Smithsonian Responds to Deficit Commission's Recommendation on Admission Fees &amp;#124; Newsdesk |publisher=Newsdesk.si.edu |date=November 12, 2010 |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116150742/http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-responds-deficit-commission-s-recommendation-admission-fees |archivedate=November 16, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As approved by [[United States Congress|Congress]] on August 10, 1846, the legislation that created the Smithsonian Institution called for the creation of a Board of Regents to govern and administer the organization.&lt;ref name="Stam"/&gt; This 17-member board meets at least four times a year and includes as ''[[ex officio]]'' members the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] and the [[Vice President of the United States]]. The nominal head of the Institution is the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]], an office which has traditionally been held by the Chief Justice. In September 2007, the board created the position of Chair of the Board of Regents, a position currently held by [[John W. McCarter]] of Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/smithsonian-board-regents|title=Smithsonian Board of Regents (in the "Newsdesk" section of the SI web site)|date=June 7, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612003823/http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/smithsonian-board-regents|archivedate=June 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other members of the Board of Regents are three members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] appointed by the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]; three members of the Senate, appointed by the [[Senate of the United States#Officers|President ''pro tempore'' of the Senate]]; and nine citizen members, nominated by the board and approved by the Congress in a joint resolution signed by the President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/kits/default.htm Smithsonian Press Kit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407183020/http://newsdesk.si.edu/kits/default.htm |date=April 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regents who are senators or representatives serve for the duration of their elected terms, while citizen Regents serve a maximum of two six-year terms. Regents are compensated on a part-time basis.

The [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the Smithsonian is the Secretary, who is appointed by the Board of Regents.  The Secretary also serves as secretary to the Board of Regents, but is not a voting member of that body. The Secretary of the Smithsonian has the [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate, Rule XXIII|privilege of the floor]] at the [[United States Senate]]. There have been 12 Secretaries. On September 18, 2013, Secretary G. Wayne Clough announced he would retire in October 2014. The Smithsonian Board of Regents said it has asked regent John McCarter, Jr. to lead a search committee. The search committee will consist of other regents and representatives from Smithsonian museums and centers.&lt;ref name="Cloughret"&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/top-shelf/2013/09/smithsonian-chief-will-retire-in-2014.html Cooper, Rebecca.

On March 10, 2014, the Smithsonian Board of Directors selected Dr. [[David Skorton]], a physician and president of [[Cornell University]] as the 13th Secretary of the Smithsonian.

==Controversies==

===''Enola Gay'' display===
{{See also|Enola Gay#Exhibition controversy|l1= ''Enola Gay'' exhibition controversy }}

In 1995, controversy arose over the exhibit at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] with the display of the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', the [[Superfortress]] used by the United States to drop the first [[atomic bomb]] used in [[World War II]]. The [[American Legion]] and [[Air Force Association]] believed the exhibit put forward only one side of the [[debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], and that it emphasized the effect on victims without discussing its use within the overall context of the war. The Smithsonian changed the exhibit, displaying the aircraft only with associated technical data and without discussion of its historic role in the war.

===Censorship of "Seasons of Life and Land"===
In 2003, a [[National Museum of Natural History]] exhibit, [[Subhankar Banerjee]]'s ''Seasons of Life and Land'', featuring photographs of the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]], was censored and moved to the basement by Smithsonian officials because they feared that its subject matter was too politically controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A17628-2003May20&amp;notFound=true | work=The Washington Post | title=Smithsonian's Arctic Refuge Exhibit Draws Senate Scrutiny | first=Jacqueline | last=Trescott | date=May 21, 2003 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429173241/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A17628-2003May20&amp;notFound=true | archivedate=April 29, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported internal criticism has been raised regarding the institution's handling of the exhibit on the Arctic. According to documents and e-mails, the exhibit and its associated presentation were edited at high levels to add "scientific uncertainty" regarding the nature and impact of [[global warming]] on the [[Arctic]]. Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian [[Cristián Samper]] was interviewed by the ''Post'', and claimed the exhibit was edited because it contained conclusions that went beyond what could be proven by contemporary [[climatology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Scientists Fault Climate Exhibit Changes | date=November 16, 2007 | publisher= | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/15/AR2007111502550.html?hpid=topnews | work=[[Washington Post]] | page=4 | accessdate=November 18, 2007 | first1=James V. | last1=Grimaldi | first2=Jacqueline | last2=Trescott | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429173254/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/15/AR2007111502550.html?hpid=topnews | archivedate=April 29, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smithsonian is now a participant in the [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalchange.gov/about/program-structure/agencies |title=Integrating federal research and solutions for climate and global change |author= |date= |work=Participating Departments and Agencies |publisher=U.S. Global Change Research Program |accessdate=March 30, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310123640/http://globalchange.gov/about/program-structure/agencies |archivedate=March 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright restrictions===
The Smithsonian Institution provides access to its image collections for educational, scholarly, and nonprofit uses. Commercial uses are generally restricted unless permission is obtained. Smithsonian images fall into different copyright categories; some are protected by copyright, many are subject to license agreements or other contractual conditions, and some fall into the public domain, such as those prepared by Smithsonian employees as part of their official duties. The Smithsonian's terms of use for its digital content, including images, are set forth on the Smithsonian Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.si.edu/copyright |title=Terms of use of this website |publisher=Si.edu |date= |accessdate=July 26, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716063125/http://www.si.edu/copyright/ |archivedate=July 16, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smithsonianimages.si.edu/siphoto/siphoto.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=content&amp;contentpath=copyright.html |title=Smithsonian Images-Copyright |publisher=Smithsonianimages.si.edu |date=January 13, 2012 |accessdate=July 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002131433/http://smithsonianimages.si.edu/siphoto/siphoto.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=content&amp;contentpath=copyright.html |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, the institution entered into an agreement of "first refusal" rights for its vast [[silent film|silent]] and [[public domain]] film archives with [[Showtime Networks]], mainly for use on the [[Smithsonian Channel]], a network created from this deal. Critics contend this agreement effectively gives Showtime control over the film archives, as it requires filmmakers to obtain permission from the network to use extensive amounts of film footage from the Smithsonian archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/01/arts/television/01smit.html?|title=Smithsonian Agreement Angers Filmmakers|publisher=New York Times,|date=April 1, 2006|first=Edward|last=Wyatt|accessdate=May 23, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501003705/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/01/arts/television/01smit.html|archivedate=May 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smithsonian contends independent producers continue to have unchanged access to the institution and its collections as they had prior to the agreement.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The process to gain access to film at the Smithsonian remains the same.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Since January 2006, independent producers have made more than 500 requests to film in the museums and collections or to use archival footage and photos.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The art and science of collecting and managing [[Submission (Electronic)|submissions]] (of any kind) is called Submission Management. Traditionally, submissions were collected offline i.e. in the form of 'hard' paper files or folders. However, with the recent penetration of [[Internet]] in almost every sphere of life, there has been a steady shift towards collecting electronic submissions as compared to hard copies of submissions. The Internet has also facilitated a change in the perception towards the deliverables or contents of a submission. As a result of this, submitting audio and video files, pictures and presentations in addition to standard text, [[Word document|word]] and pdf-like documents has become common in the last few years.

Managing submissions may include evaluating submissions and providing feedback to submitters, accepting or rejecting submissions or requesting submitters to make a re-submission. In some cases, a panel of experts may also be requested to assist in the evaluation of submissions by reviewing or judging them.

==Common scenarios==
===Academics===
It is a common practice for teachers, professors and teaching assistants to get [[Assignment (education)|assignments]] and projects submitted by students, either electronically or otherwise. These assignments are graded and the students are given [[Feedback#In_education|feedback]] on whatever they submitted and how can they improve it. In institutes where academic submissions are done electronically, there generally is a [[Learning management system|system]] (usually a web-based one) in place to assist in the collection and management of submissions.

===Call-for-paper (academic) conferences===
In call-for-paper or [[academic conference]]s, prospective presenters are usually asked to submit a short abstract of their presentation or research work, which is reviewed before being accepted for the conference. Some conferences require researchers to submit a full paper of about 6–15 pages, which is [[peer review]]ed by members of the conference's [[program committee]] and/or external reviewers chosen by them.

===Competitions and contests===
Most [[competition]]s and [[Competition|contest]]s held world over usually have an initial screening round in which they accept nominations or entries from prospective participants. After all the [[nomination]]s and entries have been received, the organizers of the competition or contest evaluate and shortlist the required number of entries on the basis of certain parameters set by them, notify the participants whose entries have been shortlisted and invite them to participate in further rounds of the competition or contest. Those whose entries were not shortlisted may also be given feedback by the organizers with a reason for the rejection and tips for improvement.

===College events and fests===
[[Student groups|Student bodies]] in colleges and universities usually organize various inter-college and intra-college events and fests on an annual and/or [[semester]] basis. These events and fests are usually made up of several big and small competitions and contests, each of which generally follow a procedure as explained in the paragraph above.

===Pharmaceuticals industry===
Regulatory submissions in the pharmaceutical–biotechnology and medical device industry comprise documents and data that are submitted to a regulatory agency to gain approval to market new drugs, biologics and devices but also when modifications are introduced in registered data (variations). The documentation represents years of research and includes multi-disciplinary information (including preclinical and clinical data) regarding the safety and efficacy of a compound. The regulatory process varies from country to country and involves numerous interactions between the submitting company (sponsor) and the regulatory authority (agency). Many regulatory agencies accept electronic submissions in conjunction with or in lieu of submitting paper.

===Human resources===
[[Human resources|Human resource]] departments collect [[résumé]]s and [[Curriculum vitae|CVs]] as a part of processing job applications. Applicants submit their résumés either via email, on the website of their prospective employer or on [[employment websites]] that help connect job seekers and employers.

===Contemporary art===
In [[contemporary art]], curators often select and interpret works of art created by various artists. Before the popularity of the Internet, this was often done in person but these days some curators prefer artists submitting pictures of their work over email or by other electronic means for an initial screening. If the curator likes a particular work of art, he may electronically communicate his desire to work with the artist after verifying that the picture is indeed of his work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===The fashion industry===
[[Model (person)|Models]] create and maintain portfolios which they use to showcase themselves during the process of getting selected for various fashion shows, advertisements and other events in the fashion industry. Those who are responsible for taking a decision on which models to choose usually ask prospective models to submit their portfolios with them. They take their decision after evaluating all the portfolios available with them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Publication and media houses===
Journalists and writers (full-time as well as [[freelancer]]s) usually submit their articles and reports to editors of magazines, journals, newspapers and news channels who then select which ones will be published and/or telecasted and which ones won't be. At times, editors even provide feedback to the authors of reports with an intention of seeking pre-publication improvement.

===Government applications===
Most government procedures demand the filling up of a form, either electronically or on paper. Citizens submit their forms to the desired government agency by their preferred mode of communication after which the agency performs an initial verification during which they may contact the concerned person for further information, data or correction of errors. After the verification stage, the forms are marked for processing and the concerned person is intimated once the processing is over. The processing stage may involve external or sister agencies too.

==Challenges==
===Submission standards and formats===
As companies, agencies and institutes move towards [[electronic submission]]s, a lot of complexity has been added in the submission management domain. In the paper world, much of the effort of managing a submission involves printing and collating volumes of information but with electronic submissions, it becomes increasingly difficult to efficiently manage the tens and thousands of submissions coming from different sources, in different formats at different times. As a result, many agencies are in the process of trying to implement global standards for submission formats and standards.

One example of this is the standards put forth by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) in the context of the pharmaceuticals industry. The ICH has developed the [[electronic Common Technical Document]] (eCTD) to promote harmonization of regulatory submissions in electronic format across various regions (United States, Europe and Japan).&lt;ref name="ICH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estri.ich.org/eCTD/eCTD_Specification_v3_2.pdf|title=The ICH eCTD Specification V 3.2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916072404/http://estri.ich.org/eCTD/eCTD_Specification_v3_2.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inappropriate modes and lack of automated systems===
Email is by-far the most popular mode for collecting and managing electronic submissions and post for paper submissions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Since, both these processes are manual to quite an extent, they often lead to delays, inconsistencies and mishaps. In some setups, there are tailor-made systems that help collectors of submissions to some extent but they often fail owing to their ultra specific nature.

The key to successful submission management involves tracking each submission as well as all its versions and sub-parts that may be related to it or dependent on it. In addition to planning and tracking submission content, it is also important to manage and allocate resources effectively based on workload, skill sets and availability. Submission collectors may seek the help of expert [[reviewer]]s or judges in such cases. All these reasons have motivated many companies and researchers to begin looking at submission management as a formal discipline and to start analyzing metrics behind various submission processes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Submission management systems==
Certain software vendors have begun developing [[submission management system]]s to assist submission collectors in the automation, tracking and management of complex submission processes. Most of these systems are [[web based]] and accessible from any device with a browser and an Internet connection. However, a majority of these systems are application specific and cannot be applied to all submission management scenarios. This means that a lot of work needs to be done in this field before we have good and reliable submission management systems that are suitable and usable in every context of submission management.

==History==

The Mars Generation was founded in 2015 by 18-year-old [[Abigail Harrison]], popularly known as "Astronaut Abby" and has the support of high-level advisory board members which includes astronauts, engineers and scientists as well as [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], [[education]] and [[business]] professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/30544-astronaut-abby-launches-mars-generation.html|title=Launching 'The Mars Generation': Teen on Mission to Get People to Mars|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2017/03/17/meet-abby-harrison-the-college-sophomore-headed-for-mars/|title=Meet Abby Harrison, the college sophomore headed for Mars|date=2017-03-17|website=USA TODAY College|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison started [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] and space advocacy work at the age of 13 by initially setting up a [[Twitter]] account under her childhood nickname "Astronaut Abby."  She used her @AstronautAbby&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AstronautAbby|title=Abigail Harrison (@AstronautAbby) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter account to connect with [[NASA]] employees to try and procure a quote for her National History Day project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/astronaut-abby-hearts-nasa.html|title=NASA – Astronaut Abby Hearts NASA|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Flint Wild : MSFC, Shelley Canright : HQ, Diedra Williams : MSFC, Cindy McArthur : JSC, Rachel Kraft : JSC, Ann Marie Trotta : HQ, Nicole Harrison : POC, Abby Harrison : POC|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her account biography stated that she was aspiring to be an astronaut and had a goal to be the first person to set foot on Mars. After she received the NASA quote, she began to share her journey to Mars which included tweets about space events, school and her personal life with the goal of not only exciting people about mars exploration but creating advocates for human space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/astronaut-abby-hearts-nasa.html|title=NASA – Astronaut Abby Hearts NASA|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Flint Wild : MSFC, Shelley Canright : HQ, Diedra Williams : MSFC, Cindy McArthur : JSC, Rachel Kraft : JSC, Ann Marie Trotta : HQ, Nicole Harrison : POC, Abby Harrison : POC|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, at 15-years old, Harrison partnered with her mentor, Astronaut [[Luca Parmitano]] as his [[Earth]] Liaison and shared his experience living in space on the [[International Space Station]] during [[Expedition 36]] and [[Expedition 37]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universetoday.com/101824/why-an-astronaut-asked-15-year-old-abby-to-help-get-the-word-out/#more-101824|title=Why An Astronaut Asked 15 Year Old Abby to Help Get The Word Out – Universe Today|date=2013-04-30|work=Universe Today|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harrison setup an international outreach program consisting of classroom web chats, an [[email]] [[pen pal]] program, [[classroom]] visits, blogging on AstronautAbby.com, writing for other publications, speaking at events, and sharing on [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorecuriocity.org/Explore/ArticleId/2326/astronaut-abby-2326.aspx|title=CurioCity – CurioCité {{!}} Astronaut Abby|website=explorecuriocity.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially called the Soyuz Adventure, after Astronaut Parmitano returned to [[Earth]], it was renamed "The Future of Space" and Harrison continued to run the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/astronaut-abby-is-crowdfunding-her-way-to-outer-space/208184441/|title='Astronaut Abby' is crowdfunding her way to outer space|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://skepticlab.com/episode/029-mission-to-mars-with-astronaut-abby/|title=#029 – Mission to Mars with Astronaut Abby – SkepticLab|work=SkepticLab|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program was the basis for the development of The Mars Generation nonprofit in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2017/03/17/meet-abby-harrison-the-college-sophomore-headed-for-mars/|title=Meet Abby Harrison, the college sophomore headed for Mars|date=2017-03-17|website=USA TODAY College|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sea.pcmag.com/news/9272/mars-and-the-public-imagination|title=Mars and the Public Imagination|date=2016-01-05|work=PCMag Asia|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics include government files, corporate memos, court documents, police reports and eyewitness statements, Congressional testimony, reports from various sources, maps, patents, web pages, photographs, video, sound recordings, news articles, and books. The name is a tribute to the "[[memory hole]]" from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', a slot into which government officials deposit politically inconvenient documents and records for destruction.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;

One of the most noticeable actions was the publication of several hundred photos depicting the coffins of U.S. soldiers fallen in [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. These were obtained by Kick by filing a request based on the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. The photos sparked a controversy regarding the publication of war photos, public opinion and the behavior of the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07EFDA123AF937A15757C0A9629C8B63 |title=  Photos of Soldiers' Coffins Spark a Debate Over Access |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2008-05-06 | first1=Thom | last1=Shanker | first2=Bill | last2=Carter | date=2004-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nina Veiga Boneca Waldorf (21).JPG|right|thumb|200px|Waldorf dolls]]
A '''Waldorf doll''' (also called '''Steiner doll''') is a form of doll compatible with [[Waldorf education|Waldorf (or Steiner) education]] philosophies. Dolls are generally made of natural fibers—such as wool, cotton, or linen—from their stuffing to their hair to their clothing. The doll makers use techniques drawing on traditional European doll-making. The dolls appearance is intentionally simple in order to allow the child playing with it to develop the imagination and creative play. For instance, it has either no  features, or a simple neutral expression. The legs and arms are soft and if flexible allow natural postures. They are ideally entirely natural. Dolls vary in the form best suited to the stage of development of the child; from a simple sack or pillow doll for a baby, a knotted or handkerchief style for a teething child, a simple doll with bulky limbs and either short hair or a hat for a toddler. For an older more independent child who can change clothing and dress hair, 'formed' limbed dolls with the ability to sit are introduced with changeable clothing and often longer hair, Typically hair on a Waldorf doll is made of pure wool such as mohair or boucle, ply wool or cotton. facial feature details on a Waldorf doll vary with the maker, generally simple stitches, sometimes painted but features are always a simple suggestion and ideally neutral, so the child can imagine the personality and mood of the doll and if the doll is awake or asleep. Some Waldorf dolls have small suggestions of noses. Skin, eye and mouth colors vary with each doll, ideally to reflect the colouring of the child for a first doll.

'''Willow Harris''' (also '''Ranger''') is a fictional character from the Australian television soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Sarah Roberts (actress)|Sarah Roberts]]. The character made her first screen appearance on 14 November 2017. Roberts had auditioned for the roles of both [[Kat Chapman]] and [[Scarlett Snow]] prior to playing Willow. She auditioned successfully and attended screen testing with [[James Stewart (Australian actor)|James Stewart]] who play's Willow's love interest [[Justin Morgan (Home and Away)|Justin Morgan]]. Willow was originally going to be named Amber. She is characterised as a tough female who was raised in a broken home and has subsequently learned to look after herself. Roberts has said that she admires the character's strong personality. Willow is introduced into the show wearing leather, chains and riding a motorbike. This added to her image as a powerful female character.

Writers quickly paired her with Justin and their relationship is marred by a feud with gang member [[Boyd Easton]] ([[Steve Le Marquand]]). His family kidnap Justin's daughter [[Ava Gilbert]] (Grace Thomas), which ends the relationship. Producers introduced Willow's ex-boyfriend [[Dean Thompson]] (Patrick O'Connor) and they resume their relationship. A gambling addiction story was written for Willow and she ends up stealing, loaning money, scamming people and squatting. Roberts found the gambling story challenging and carried out extensive research to accurately portray the issue. The character has been well received by critics of the genre who analysed her strong personality and dramatic introduction into the series.

==Casting==

The actress said Willow would bring "mischief and a bit of trouble" to Summer Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/plus7/home-and-away/-/watch/37845338/home-and-away-extras-willow-harris/|title=All there is to know about Willow Harris|publisher=[[Yahoo7]]|accessdate=15 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115143257/https://au.tv.yahoo.com/plus7/home-and-away/-/watch/37845338/home-and-away-extras-willow-harris/|archivedate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willow's introduction into ''Home and Away'' showcased her characteristion. Roberts said that Willow proves herself to be "a tough cookie – she's a total firecracker", as she rides into Summer Bay on a motorbike.&lt;ref name=insidesoap3/&gt; She immediately makes herself known to Justin and accuses him of stealing $15,000. Roberts said that Willow validates her tough persona in the scenes where she attacks Justin, ties him up and locks him in his garage overnight.&lt;ref name=insidesoap3/&gt; Roberts told Tamara Cullen from ''[[TV Week]]'' that Willow "rode into town with a lot of power, she's definitely going to cause some mischief!"&lt;ref name=nowto1/&gt;

Roberts told a journalist from ''[[New Idea (magazine)|New Idea]]'' that Willow was "definitely a bad girl. But for all the right reasons. She has taken wrong turns and made decisions that some people would consider 'bad', but only to help the people that she loves."&lt;ref name="ShockAttack"/&gt; In another interview the actress described Willow as "very sassy and fun. She's got attitude. I think she's a woman who knows what she wants and won't stop until she gets it, but is also fiercely loyal and will do anything for the people she loves."&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Roberts liked her character's "really strong" and "feisty" side and believed the character would stop at nothing to get what she wants. Willow had a difficult life and upbringing, as a result she "put a guard up" not allowing others to emotionally connect with her.&lt;ref name=cromarty/&gt; Willow has a "tougher" wardrobe than that of a traditional feminine one. This helped Roberts to get into character, with her explaining that "I put on her costume and totally feel like her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brygel |first1=Jackie |title=Home And Away's James Stewart on co-star and girlfriend Sarah Roberts |url=https://www.newidea.com.au/home-and-away-james-stewart-on-co-star-and-girlfriend-sarah-roberts |website=[[New Idea]] |publisher=([[Pacific Magazines]]) |accessdate=2 October 2018 |date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Justin Morgan===
Willow was introduced into the show as a new love interest for Justin Morgan.&lt;ref name=ok/&gt; Her first story follows her getting into trouble with [[Boyd Easton]] ([[Steve Le Marquand]]) because she owes him money. He attacks Willow's father and pushes him down stairs. He then vandalises Justin's garage to serve as a warning to help Willow return the missing money.&lt;ref name=soaplife1/&gt; Justin tries to reason with Boyd and his biker gang but the meeting turns violent, leaving Justin bruised. He reports the incident to the police which gets Boyd arrested. [[Martin Ashford (Home and Away)|Ash]] ([[George Mason (actor)|George Mason]]) tries warn Justin to stay away from Willow, he fear for her safety and convinces Willow to move into the local caravan park.&lt;ref name=soaplife1/&gt; Claire Crick from ''[[Soaplife]]'' reported that Justin quickly assumes the role of Willow's "knight in shining armour". She added that despite Willow causing trouble for Justin, he cannot stop thinking about her.&lt;ref name=soaplife2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crick |first1=Claire |title=Watch out, Justin... she's trouble! |journal=[[Soaplife]] |date=17-23 February 2018 |issue=427 |pages=36-37 |publisher=([[TI Media]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart told Sarah Ellis from ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that "Justin is becoming quite protective of Willow" and his character "is thrilled" when he gets to spend time with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Sarah |title=Justin cops a beating! |journal=[[Inside Soap]] |date=10-16 February 2018 |issue=6 |pages=25 |publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts and Stewart soon began a relationship off screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Briggs |first1=Zoe |title=Inside Home and Away's Sarah Roberts and James Stewart's real life romance |url=https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-feature/1321172/home-and-away-sarah-roberts-james-stewarts-real-life-romance-willow-justin-morgan |website=[[OK!]] |publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]]) |accessdate=13 August 2018 |date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts believed their own romance made playing an on screen couple easy. She told Fiona Byrne from the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' that "i did not even have to create any chemistry when I was on screen with Jimmy, it was all just there, it was not a job."&lt;ref name=ok&gt;{{cite web |last1=Byrne |first1=Fiona |title=James Stewart and Sarah Roberts: Home and Away stars confirm real life romance |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/fiona-byrne/onscreen-chemistry-turned-into-reallife-romance-for-home-and-away-stars/news-story/d6c61e6a3f441c2e9dfb9a5299fc11e2 |website=[[Herald Sun]] |publisher=([[News Corp Australia]]) |accessdate=13 August 2018 |date=27 January 2018}}{{subscriptionrequired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On screen their relationship burgeons when Justin helps Willow secure employment in Summer Bay. Willow competes against [[Mason Morgan]] ([[Orpheus Pledger]]) for a job at the gym. The gym's manager [[John Palmer (Home and Away)|John Palmer]] ([[Shane Withington]]) asks Justin to make the decision about hiring staff. They equally impress him and both receive a job. Willow thanks Justin for his help and they soon end up having sex in her caravan. Their romance has a tumultuous start after Justin asks if their sexual encounter means they are in a relationship. Willow states that she wants a casual arrangement and throws him out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Sasha |title=Home and Away spoilers: Summer Bay goes X-rated as two characters have steamy romp |url=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz-tv/hot-tv/683348/Home-and-Away-spoilers-Sarah-Roberts-Willow-Harris-romp-Justin-Morgan-James-Stewart |website=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]] |publisher=([[Northern &amp; Shell]]) |accessdate=13 August 2018 |language=en |date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later episodes the pair resume their romance.

Dean is a member of the show's fictional criminal gang The River Boys, which Willow also has connections with. Initially Justin does not realise that Willow used to be romantically involved with Dean.&lt;ref name=soaplife3&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crick |first1=Claire |title=Willow's blast from the past! |journal=[[Soaplife]] |date=17-23 March 2018 |issue=431 |pages=37 |publisher=([[TI Media]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers continued to create trouble between the couple. She was unaware Justin has a daughter, [[Ava Gilbert]] (Grace Thomas). When she comes to stay it shocks Willow, but she and Ava get on well. Justin does not let Willow stay over to avoid upsetting Ava.&lt;ref name=soaplife4/&gt; A ''Home and Away'' publicist told ''Soaplife's'' Crick that Justin is later forced to trust Willow and leave Ava in her care. But when Willow allows Ava to cook dinner, Justin is outraged at the sight of his daughter handling knifes and boiling water. He argues with Willow and their relationship is left "fledging".&lt;ref name=soaplife4&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crick |first1=Claire |title=Happy Families for Justin &amp; Willow! |journal=[[Soaplife]] |date=5-11 May 2018 |issue=438 |pages=37 |publisher=([[TI Media]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story takes a sinister turn when Ava is kidnapped by [[Hazel Easton]] ([[Genevieve Lemon]]), who is Boyd's mother. They demand ransom money for Ava's safe return. The publicist told Crick that Willow blames herself because she caused their involvement in Boyd's vendetta. Willow cooperates with Boyd, hands over the cash and Ava is returned home safe. But a local police officer, [[Colby Thorne]] (Tim Franklin) shoots and kills Boyd.&lt;ref name=soaplife5&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crick |first1=Claire |title=Ava hostage drama turns fatal! |journal=[[Soaplife]] |date=19-25 May 2018|issue=440 |pages=36-37 |publisher=([[TI Media]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ava's mother [[Nina Gilbert (Home and Away)|Nina Gilbert]] ([[Zoe Naylor]]) warns Willow that Justin cannot have access to Ava if he remains involved with her. Willow breaks-up with Justin and gets back with her ex-boyfriend Dean.

She gets with Dean to ensure that Justin moves on. Dean pursues a relationship with Willow and Roberts believed Dean talked her character into it. She assessed "I think Willow is better suited to Justin though. She came to Summer Bay to straighten her life out, and Justin was a perfect match for that reason."&lt;ref name=insidesoap1&gt;{{cite journal |title=Willow snogs Dean! |journal=[[Inside Soap]] |date=9-15 June 2018 |issue=23 |pages=29 |publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gambling addiction===
{{Quote box|width=15%|align=right|bgcolor=#E6E6FA|quote="Justin has past experience with addicts [...] but Willow's going to be a tough nut to crack when she doesn't even want to help herself."&lt;ref name=soaplife8&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crick |first1=Claire |title=Willow hits rock bottom! |journal=[[Soaplife]] |date=11-17 August 2018|issue=452 |pages=37 |publisher=([[TI Media]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=—A ''Home and Away'' publicist on Willow's addiction (2018)}}Writers planned a gambling addiction storyline for the character. Roberts found it challenging to portray because she had not experienced gambling addiction before. She carried out extensive research into the issue and spoke to gambling addicts to gain an insight into their lives. Roberts said that she used the new found knowledge to deliver a better story on screen.&lt;ref name=insidesoap2/&gt; Willow's gambling problems began following her break-up with Justin. When Willow starts a relationship with Dean he loses his job at the garage. Willow struggles to pay both her and Dean's rent at the caravan park. Willow steals money from the till at the gym and her friend [[Jasmine Delaney]] ([[Sam Frost (TV personality)|Sam Frost]]) catches her.&lt;ref name=metro1/&gt; Jasmine takes pity on Willow and gives her a loan. But when [[Alf Stewart]] ([[Ray Meagher]]) asks for more rent, Willow becomes desperate and gambles away her remaining funds.&lt;ref name=metro1/&gt; She then sells gym equipment to pay Jasmine back, which also leads to a confrontation with Jasmine.&lt;ref name=metro1/&gt; Roberts told a reporter from ''TV Week'' that Willow's gambling addiction is out of control. She explained that her character "feels guilty and shameful, and is acting out in weird ways."&lt;ref name=nowto2/&gt; Willow down plays her addiction but Dean refuses to accept her lies. Roberts said that "Dean knows her so well and can usually help her when things go wrong, but this time, it seems she's in too deep."&lt;ref name=nowto2&gt;{{cite web |title=Jasmine faces the brunt of Willow's rage on Home and Away |url=https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/tv/willow-slaps-jasmine-home-and-away-spoilers-49106 |website=Now To Love |publisher=([[Bauer Media Group]]) |accessdate=13 August 2018 |date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasmine later learns that Willow has been gambling and tells her that she needs help to treat her addiction. Willow does not take kindly to Jasmine's interfering and slaps her across the face.&lt;ref name=metro1&gt;{{cite web |last1=Groome |first1=Imogen |title=Willow descends into gambling addiction – and slaps Jasmine in Home and Away |url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/11/home-and-away-spoilers-willow-descends-into-gambling-addiction-and-gets-violent-with-jasmine-7689201/ |website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |publisher=([[DMG Media]]) |accessdate=13 August 2018 |date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts said that Willow "immediately goes on the defensive" around Jasmine. She added that her character instantly regrets slapping Jasmine because she "knows she's gone too far." The actress was nervous about filming the slap scene. A stunt coordinator taught Roberts and Frost how to make a fake slap without contact look authentic.&lt;ref name=nowto2/&gt; Writers continued to make Willow down on her luck when she tells John the truth about her thefts from the gym. He is upset with her and fires her from her job.

They decide to skim credit cards and tamper with the card machine inside the local restaurant Salt. When they exit the building, they knock Alf to the ground and leave him unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crick |first1=Claire |title=Dean &amp; Willow get desperate! |journal=[[Soaplife]] |date=28 July – 3 August 2018|issue=450 |pages=38 |publisher=([[TI Media]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irene Roberts]] ([[Lynne McGranger]]) becomes their first victim of card skimming when money disappears from her account. The actress told Ellis (''Inside Soap'') that Willow does not want to steal from "decent people", but feels that she has no choice. She also defended her character over Alf and Irene's misfortune, revealing Willow "feels terrible" and "never meant to hurt anyone."&lt;ref name=insidesoap2/&gt;

Writers planned a break-up for Willow and Dean following her continuous problems. Dean confides in Justin about Willow's gambling and requests that he look after her. He then breaks-up with her leaving Justin free to help her. A ''Home and Away'' publicist revealed that Dean "reluctantly" ends the relationship and "know's that Justin is the only person she will listen to."&lt;ref name=soaplife7/&gt; Justin struggles to help Willow overcome her addiction. She lashes out at Justin and blames him for her addiction, but Tori tells her that she ruined her own life.&lt;ref name=soaplife8/&gt; Roberts did not believe that Willow and Dean's relationship was good for her character. She branded it a "whirlwind relationship" that created a "worrying future". Despite this she noted that ''Home and Away'' viewers "love" the duo's "history and unyielding friendship".&lt;ref name=insidesoap2&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sarah |last=Ellis |title=Credit crunchers! |journal=[[Inside Soap]] |date=28 July - 3 August 2018 |issue=30 |pages=47 |publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Willow's tough persona and dramatic entrance into the series have drawn critical analysis.
