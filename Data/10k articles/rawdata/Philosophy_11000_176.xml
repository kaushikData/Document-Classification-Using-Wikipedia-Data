'''After Capitalism: Economic Democracy in Action''' is a 2012 book by United States author [[Dada Maheshvarananda]], an activist, yoga monk and writer. The book argues that global capitalism is terminally ill because it suffers from four fatal flaws: growing inequity and concentration of wealth, addiction to speculation instead of production, rising unsustainable debt and its tendency to exploit the natural environment. The author proposes a grassroots movement for economic democracy with cooperatives and local economies based on the [[Progressive Utilization Theory]] or Prout, a post-capitalist model conceptualized by [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] of India. The book includes a conversation with [[Noam Chomsky]] and essays by [[Frei Betto]], [[Johan Galtung]], [[Leonardo Boff]], [[Sohail Inayatullah]], Marcos Arruda, [[Ravi Batra]] and others.

==Background==
The author's first book, ''After Capitalism: Prout’s Vision for a New World'', with a preface by Noam Chomsky, was published in 2003 and, subsequently, translated into nine other languages. However, when the author started to update it, he discovered that both the world and the development of Prout had changed so much that more than 80 percent of the text was actually new material. Beyond this, [[economic democracy]], a fundamental demand of Prout, was also starting to resonate with the [[Indignados|Indignados Movement of Spain]] and the global [[Occupy Movement]]. Hence this book has a new title.

[[Gregory Wilpert]], author of ''Changing Venezuela by Taking Power'', wrote, "After Capitalism is a crucial contribution towards figuring out where we want to go, not only after capitalism, but now, as we try to build the new world within the old." Ecologist [[Bill McKibben]] wrote, "There are plenty of interesting leads in these pages that will get you thinking!" [[George Katsiaficas]], activist and author of ''Asia's Unknown Uprisings'', wrote: "With grace and intelligence, Dada Maheshvarananda illuminates paths of personal enlightenment and global transformation." [[Charles Eisenstein]], author of ''Sacred Economics'', wrote, "A broad ecological, social, political and spiritual awareness informs this vision of a new economic future." [[David Schweickart]], author of another book entitled ''After Capitalism'', wrote, "This is an amazing book, breathtaking in its range and ambition." Peter Bohmer, activist and faculty at the [[Evergreen State College]], wrote, “I enthusiastically recommend this book for a college classroom and for those who are organizing for economic and social justice.”

=== Mixed ===
Jeff Fleischer in [[ForeWord Reviews]] wrote, "Most of the book is simply an explanation of Prout, and has the same strengths and weaknesses of the theory itself. While many of the goals advocated by Maheshvarananda and Prout supporters—such as diminishing income inequality and promoting citizen cooperatives—are certainly admirable, the theory is often vague about how they would be achieved or what a transition to a Prout economy would look like on a large scale... Too often, After Capitalism will seem naively unrealistic to opponents of Prout's vision while simultaneously obscure and lacking in specifics for those who would like to see its principles applied... Maheshvarananda is more effective in his critique of how current economic systems have created global wealth inequality, and at citing statistics for how poverty has spread even in wealthier nations. The most interesting parts of the book, however, are the guest contributions, which serve as case studies of using Prout principles in specific, smaller-scale projects around the world. While these contributions are quite short, they offer some of the detail lacking in the overall treatise."&lt;ref&gt;“[https://www.forewordreviews.com/reviews/after-capitalism/ After Capitalism: Economic Democracy in Action], by Jeff Fleischer, ''ForeWord Reviews'', Dec. 5 2012.”&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agostino Steuco''' (in [[Latin]] '''Agostinus Steuchus''' or '''Eugubinus''') (1497/1498–1548), Italian [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]], [[Old Testament]] scholar, [[Counter Reformation]] polemicist and antiquarian, was born at [[Gubbio]] in [[Umbria]].

In 1513 he entered the congregation of the Order of the Augustinian Canons of San Salvatore of Bologna, taking up residence in the monastery of San Secundo, one of the order's houses in Gubbio.  In 1524 he went to the mother cloister in [[Bologna]], from where he briefly attended courses in [[Hebrew]] and rhetoric at the [[University of Bologna]].  In 1525 he was sent by his congregation to the [[Monastery]] of Sant' Antonio di Castello in [[Venice]], where, due to his expertise in [[biblical languages]] and humanist textual criticism, he was placed in charge of the monastery's library, donated to the canons by Cardinal [[Domenico Grimani]]. Many of the collection's biblical, Hebrew, and philosophical works had once been owned by [[Pico della Mirandola]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanegraaff p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next several years (1529–33) Steuco wrote a series of polemical works against [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[Erasmus]], the latter of whom he accused of helping to foment the [[Protestant Revolt]] against the [[Christian Church|Church]]. These works show Steuco's staunch support of the [[Christian traditions|traditions and practices of the Church]], including a strident defense of [[papal authority]].  Part of his output during this period included a major set of annotations on the [[Pentateuch]], titled ''{{lang|la|Veteris testamenti ad Hebraicam veritatem recognitio}}'', in which he used Hebrew and Greek manuscripts from the [[Grimani Library]] to correct [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate]] translation of the Old Testament text. When explaining the text, he never strayed from the literal and historical meaning. An interesting juxtaposition to this work of humanist [[biblical exegesis]] was a syncretic philosophical work that he wrote in this period, to which he gave the title ''Cosmopoeia''.

His polemical and exegetical works attracted the notice of [[Pope Paul III]], and in 1538 the pope made Steuco bishop of Chisamo on the island of [[Crete]], and librarian of the papal collection of manuscripts and printed works in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]].  While he never visited his bishopric in Crete, Steuco did actively fulfill his role as [[Vatican Library|Vatican Librarian]] until his death in 1548. While in Rome he authored Old Testament annotations on the [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Job|Job]], again relying heavily upon Hebrew sources to help annotate and correct the texts.

In 1540 he published a major work entitled ''{{lang|la|De perenni philosophia}}'', which attempted to show that many of the ideas expounded by the sages, poets, and philosophers from classical antiquity were in essential harmony with Christianity. Since [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]], this was a common thread in Renaissance thought which spread from Italy to France and Germany, but this was the first book devoted to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Hanegraaff p.68-69&lt;/ref&gt; Steuco believed that Roman Catholicism, centred on the Gospels, is the true hidden core of pagan beliefs; Theobald Freudenberger commented that "If a [ancient] passage really refuses to fit into his system, he earnestly addresses the author and admonishes him in a fatherly way to come to his senses."&lt;ref&gt;Hanegraaff p.72-73&lt;/ref&gt; This work has a slight polemical edge to it, as Steuco crafted a number of his arguments to lend support to several theological positions that had recently come under question in Italy by reformers and critics of the traditional Catholic faith. His perspective has been described by Maria Muccillo: {{quote|Steuco proposes his “perennial philosophy,” deeply permeated by platonism, in 1540, on the eve of the Council of Trent: at a moment when, after the Protestant Reformation, the chance of restoring the unity of the Christian world would seem to be exhausted, and the very ideal – dear to many exponents of the so-called “Catholic Reform” – of a close interpenetration of the Humanist and the Catholic spirit is beginning to decline. In this historical/religious context, Steuco’s work comes to assume the significance of a desperate last attempt, effected by the means of historical erudition, of reuniting and reconciling the fragmented Christian world ... [It] represents perhaps one of the last attempts to utilize the Humanist ideals in the interest of Catholic Reform, before the latter “will yield to the disciplinary and dogmatic force of the Counter-Reformation, which will preserve from Humanism only the splendid but henceforth empty outer form.”|Maria Muccillo, ''Platonismo, Ermetismo e "Prisca Theologia"'', 7–8&lt;ref&gt;Hanegraaff p.70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a Roman humanist, he also took a deep interest in the classical ruins of Rome, and in the urban renewal efforts of Paul III throughout the city. Of particular note in this vein are a series of short orations that he wrote and possibly delivered at the papal court, urging Paul III to refurbish the aqueduct known as the [[Aqua Virgo]], in order to supply Rome with adequate fresh water, and as a major key to the revitalization of the city itself.

In 1547 Steuco was sent by Paul III to attend the [[Council of Trent]], where he could be counted upon to uphold papal prerogatives and authority. He died in 1548 while in Venice on break from the Council. He is now buried in Gubbio.

The '''argument from reason''' is an argument against [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and for the [[existence of God]] (or at least a [[supernatural]] being that is the source of human reason). The best-known defender of the argument is [[C. S. Lewis]]. Lewis first defended the argument at length in his 1947 book, ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles: A Preliminary Study]]''. In the second edition of ''Miracles'' (1960), Lewis substantially revised and expanded the argument.

Contemporary defenders of the argument from reason include [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Victor Reppert]] and [[William Harker]].

==The argument==

Methodological naturalism is the view that nature as studied by the natural sciences is all that exists. Naturalists deny the existence of a supernatural God, souls, an afterlife, or anything supernatural. Nothing exists outside or beyond the physical universe.

The argument from reason seeks to show that naturalism is self-refuting, or otherwise false and indefensible.

According to Lewis,

{{blockquote|One absolutely central inconsistency ruins [the naturalistic worldview].... The whole picture professes to depend on inferences from observed facts. Unless inference is valid, the whole picture disappears.... [U]nless Reason is an absolute--all is in ruins. Yet those who ask me to believe this world picture also ask me to believe that Reason is simply the unforeseen and unintended by-product of mindless matter at one stage of its endless and aimless becoming. Here is flat contradiction. They ask me at the same moment to accept a conclusion and to discredit the only testimony on which that conclusion can be based.|sign=C. S. Lewis, "Is Theology Poetry?", ''[[The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses]]''}}

More precisely, Lewis's argument from reason can be stated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. No belief is rationally inferred if it can be fully explained in terms of nonrational causes. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Support: Reasoning requires insight into logical relations. A process of reasoning (P therefore Q) is rational only if the reasoner sees that Q follows from, or is supported by, P, and accepts Q on that basis. Thus, reasoning is trustworthy (or "valid", as Lewis sometimes says) only if it involves a special kind of causality, namely, rational insight into logical implication or evidential support. If a bit of reasoning can be fully explained by nonrational causes, such as fibers firing in the brain or a bump on the head, then the reasoning is not reliable, and cannot yield knowledge. Consider this example: Person A refuses to go near the neighbor’s dog because he had a bad childhood experience with dogs. Person B refuses to go near the neighbor’s dog because one month ago he saw it attack someone. Both have given a reason for staying away from the dog, but person A’s reason is the result of nonrational causes, while person B has given an explanation for his behavior following from rational inference (animals exhibit patterns of behavior; these patterns are likely to be repeated; this dog has exhibited aggression towards someone who approached it; there is a good chance that the dog may exhibit the same behavior towards me if I approach it). Consider a second example: person A says that he is afraid to climb to the 8th story of a bank building because he and humans in general have a natural fear of heights resulting from the processes of evolution and natural selection. He has given an explanation of his fear, but since his fear results from nonrational causes (natural selection), his argument does not follow from logical inference.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
2. If naturalism is true, then all beliefs can be fully explained in terms of nonrational causes. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Support: Naturalism holds that nature is all that exists, and that all events in nature can in principle be explained without invoking supernatural or other nonnatural causes. Standardly, naturalists claim that all events must have physical causes, and that human thoughts can ultimately be explained in terms of material causes or physical events (such as neurochemical events in the brain) that are nonrational.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
3. Therefore, if naturalism is true, then no belief is rationally inferred (from 1 and 2). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
4. We have good reason to accept naturalism only if it can be rationally inferred from good evidence. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;5. Therefore, there is not, and cannot be, good reason to accept naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Victor Reppert, author of ''C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea''. Taken from his blog at: http://dangerousidea.blogspot.com/2006/07/argument-from-reason-and-lewiss-post.html"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In short, naturalism undercuts itself. If naturalism is true, then we cannot sensibly believe it or virtually anything else.

In some versions of the argument from reason, Lewis extends the argument to defend a further conclusion: that human reason depends on an eternal, self-existent rational Being (God). This extension of the argument from reason states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Since everything in nature can be wholly explained in terms of nonrational causes, human reason (more precisely, the power of drawing conclusions based solely on the rational cause of logical insight) must have a source outside of nature.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;2. If human reason came from non-reason it would lose all rational credentials and would cease to be reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;3. So, human reason cannot come from non-reason (from 2).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;4. So human reason must come from a source outside nature that is itself rational (from 1 and 3).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;5. This supernatural source of reason may itself be dependent on some further source of reason, but a chain of such dependent sources cannot go on forever. Eventually, we must reason back to the existence of eternal, non-dependent source of human reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;6. Therefore, there exists an eternal, self-existent, rational Being who is the ultimate source of human reason. This Being we call God (from 4-5). (Lewis, ''Miracles'', chap. 4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticisms==

On 2 February 1948, Oxford philosopher [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] read a paper to the Oxford [[Socratic Club]] criticizing the version of the argument from reason contained in the third chapter of Lewis's ''Miracles''.

Her first criticism was against the use of the word "irrational" by Lewis (Anscombe 1981: 225-26). Her point was that there is an important difference between irrational causes of belief, such as wishful thinking, and nonrational causes, such as neurons firing in the brain, that do not obviously lead to faulty reasoning. Lewis accepted the criticism and amended the argument, basing it on the concept of nonrational causes of belief (as in the version provided in this article).

Anscombe's second criticism questioned the intelligibility of Lewis's intended contrast between "valid" and "invalid" reasoning. She wrote: "What ''can'' you mean by 'valid' beyond what would be indicated by the explanation you would give for distinguishing between valid and invalid, and what in the naturalistic hypothesis prevents that explanation from being given and from meaning what it does?" (Anscombe 1981: 226) Her point is that it makes no sense to contrast "valid" and "invalid" reasoning unless it is possible for some forms of reasoning to be valid. Lewis later conceded (Anscombe 1981: 231) that "valid" was a bad word for what he had in mind. Lewis didn't mean to suggest that if naturalism is true, no arguments can be given in which the conclusions follow logically from the premises. What he meant is that a process of reasoning is "veridical", that is, reliable as a method of pursuing knowledge and truth, only if it cannot be entirely explained by nonrational causes.

Anscombe's third objection was that Lewis failed to distinguish between different senses of the terms "why", "because", and "explanation", and that what counts as a "full" explanation varies by context (Anscombe 1981: 227-31).  In the context of ordinary life, "because he wants a cup of tea" may count as a perfectly satisfactory explanation of why Peter is boiling water. Yet such a purposive explanation would not count as a full explanation (or an explanation at all) in the context of physics or biochemistry. Lewis accepted this criticism, and created a revised version of the argument in which the distinction between "because" in the sense of physical causality, and "because" in the sense of evidential support, became the central point of the argument. (This is the version described in this article.)&lt;ref&gt;For Anscombe's critical appraisal of Lewis's revised argument from reason, see Elizabeth Anscombe, "C. S. Lewis's Rewrite of Chapter III of ''Miracles''", in Roger White, Judith Wolfe, and Brendan N. Wolfe, eds., ''C. S. Lewis and His Circle: Essays and Memoirs from the Oxford C. S. Lewis Society''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015, pp. 15-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent critics have argued that Lewis's argument at best refutes only strict forms of naturalism that seek to explain everything in terms ultimately reducible to physics or purely mechanistic causes.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., David Kyle Johnson, "Con: Naturalism Undefeated," in Gregory Bassham, ed. ''C. S. Lewis's Christian Apologetics: Pro and Con''. Leiden: Brill Rodopi, 2015, pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; So-called "broad" naturalists that see consciousness as an "emergent" non-physical property of complex brains would agree with Lewis that different levels or types of causation exist in nature, and that rational inferences are not fully explainable by nonrational causes.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Charles Taliaferro, "On Naturalism," in Robert MacSwain and Michael Wards, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to C. S. Lewis''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics have objected that Lewis's argument from reason fails because the causal origins of beliefs are often irrelevant to whether those beliefs are rational, justified, warranted, etc. Anscombe, for example, argues that "if a man has reasons, and they are good reasons, and they are genuinely his reasons, for thinking something—then his thought is rational, whatever causal statements we make about him" (Anscombe 1981: 229). On many widely accepted theories of knowledge and justification, questions of how beliefs were ultimately caused (e.g., at the level of brain neurochemistry) are viewed as irrelevant to whether those beliefs are rational or justified. Some defenders of Lewis claim that this objection misses the mark, because his argument is directed at what he calls the "veridicalness" of acts of reasoning (i.e., whether reasoning connects us with objective reality or truth), rather than with whether any inferred beliefs can be rational or justified in a materialistic world.

==Similar views by other thinkers==
Philosophers such as [[Victor Reppert]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor Reppert, ''C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea: In Defense of the Argument from'' ''Reason''. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2003; Victor Reppert, "The Argument from Reason Defended," in Gregory Bassham, ed., ''C. S. Lewis's Christian Apologetics: Pro and Con''. Leiden: Brill Rodopi, 2015, pp. 75-89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hasker]]&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, ''The Emergent Self''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1999, chap. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Plantinga]]&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011, chap. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; have expanded on the argument from reason, and credit C.S. Lewis as an important influence on their thinking.

Lewis never claimed that he invented the argument from reason; in fact, he refers to it as a "venerable philosophical chestnut."&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''Collected Letters'', vol. 2, Walter Hooper ed. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 2004, p. 715.&lt;/ref&gt; Early versions of the argument occur in the works of Arthur Balfour (see, e.g., ''The Foundations of Belief'', 1879, chap. 13) and G.K. Chesterton. In Chesterton's 1908 book ''Orthodoxy'', in a chapter titled "The Suicide of Thought", he writes of the "great and possible peril . . . that the human intellect is free to destroy itself....It is idle to talk always of the alternative of reason and faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all. If you are merely a sceptic, you must sooner or later ask yourself the question, "Why should anything go right; even observation and deduction? Why should not good logic be as misleading as bad logic? They are both movements in the brain of a bewildered ape?"&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Chesterton, ''Orthodoxy''. New York: Iamge Books, 1959, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Chesterton asserts that the argument is a fundamental, if unstated, tenet of Thomism in his 1933 book ''St. Thomas Aquinas: "The Dumb Ox"'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, even those who appreciate the metaphysical depth of Thomism in other matters have expressed surprise that he does not deal at all with what many now think the main metaphysical question; whether we can prove that the primary act of recognition of any reality is real. The answer is that St. Thomas recognised instantly, what so many modern sceptics have begun to suspect rather laboriously; that a man must either answer that question in the affirmative, or else never answer any question, never ask any question, never even exist intellectually, to answer or to ask. I suppose it is true in a sense that a man can be a fundamental sceptic, but he cannot be anything else: certainly not even a defender of fundamental scepticism. If a man feels that all the movements of his own mind are meaningless, then his mind is meaningless, and he is meaningless; and it does not mean anything to attempt to discover his meaning. Most fundamental sceptics appear to survive, because they are not consistently sceptical and not at all fundamental. They will first deny everything and then admit something, if for the sake of argument--or often rather of attack without argument. I saw an almost startling example of this essential frivolity in a professor of final scepticism, in a paper the other day. A man wrote to say that he accepted nothing but Solipsism, and added that he had often wondered it was not a more common philosophy. Now Solipsism simply means that a man believes in his own existence, but not in anybody or anything else. And it never struck this simple sophist, that if his philosophy was true, there obviously were no other philosophers to profess it.&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Chesterton, ''Thomas Aquinas: The Dumb Ox''. New York: Image Books, 1933, pp. 148-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Miracles'', Lewis himself quotes J. B. S. Haldane, who appeals to a similar line of reasoning in his 1927 book, ''Possible Worlds'': "If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms."&lt;ref&gt;J. B. S. Haldane, ''Possible Worlds and Other Essays''. London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1929, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of the argument from reason occur in [[C.E.M. Joad]]'s ''Guide to Modern Philosophy'' (London: Faber, 1933, pp.&amp;nbsp;58–59), Richard Taylor's ''Metaphysics'' (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 3rd ed., 1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;104–05), and [[J. P. Moreland]]'s ''Scaling the Secular City: A Defense of Christianity'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1987, chap. 3).

The '''Associação Comunitária Monte Azul''' is a [[Brazil]]ian [[NGO]] that is active in three [[Favela]]s in the southern part of [[São Paulo]], M'Boi Mirim / Campo Limpo. The organisation was founded in 1979 by the [[Germany|German]] [[Waldorf education|Waldorf teacher]] Ute Craemer together with the residents of the Favela Monte Azul. In the 1980s the work spread to the Favela Peinha nearby and to Horizonte Azul on the southern edge of the city. The project is a successful example in sustainable [[Development cooperation]] between equal partners.

The organisation's main areas of work are slum renovation, [[Education]] and [[further education]] for children and young people, [[culture]], [[health care]] and [[environmental conservation]]. The Associação Comunitária Monte Azul today has more than 260 employees and receives around 70 overseas volunteers per year, 20 of these from other countries, in  particular Germany.

The Favela Monte Azul, which has around 3000 residents, was established in the 1970s during the period of rapid [[urbanisation]] due to the [[rural depopulation]] from North-eastern Brazil and the provinces [[Minas Gerais]] and Paraná. Through the project, by means of which Ute Craemer wished to awaken some social awareness amongst her students at the Waldorf school, she came into contact with the children of the Favela. It began with afternoon care in Ms Craemer's own home. Out of this impulse to build a bridge between the different classes of Society, a project began that is still growing and continually incorporates new aspects. At present there are an estimated 32,000 people benefitting from the work of Monte Azul.

Monte Azul has become an example for Development Aid and a model for many similar social projects that have come about in Brazil, such as the street theatre group ''Paidéia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freunde-waldorf.de/de/waldorf-weltweit/projekte/brasilien/sao-paulo-paideia.html |title=São Paulo Paideia|publisher=freunde-waldorf.de|accessdate= October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cultural and social centre Aramitán&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aramitan.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208112553/http://www.aramitan.com/ |archive-date=2014-12-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in São Paulo oder the NGO Associação Comunitária de Barra de Lama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iniciativagameleira.wordpress.com/|title=Associação Comunitária de Barra de Lama – Gameleira (PE)|work=Associação Comunitária de Barra de Lama - Gameleira (PE)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Brazil.

==Education==

There are some 1350 children and young people between the ages of four months and 21 years being cared for by the créches, nursery schools, training workshops and a local Waldorf school, the work being based on the principles of Waldorf education and [[Anthroposophy]]. A further 80 people with [[Special Needs]] are cared for in another training workshop. One of the principles of the ''Associação Comunitária Monte Azul'' is to not just communicate knowledge but rather to facilitate a comprehensive education for their children and young people that enables them to take their lives into their own hands, encouraging them to change the harsh realities that surround them.

==Culture==

Through re-enlivening and cultivating local cultural traditions the feeling of self-worth and confidence of the people is strengthened. Through meeting with foreign cultures their horizon is broadened, their consciousness stimulated and they nurture a culture based on peace. In all of its three centres, Monte Azul has theatre and conference rooms as well as libraries so as to give people access to cultural content. A variety of courses, further education, theatrical and musical events take place there, with around 600 people a month participating.

Besides this, they run a music school where children and young people from the Favela are able to learn string instruments, to play in an orchestra and to sing in the choir.

==Teacher enrichment==
From the start it was essential to further educate and train the co-workers, for they themselves had grown up in the Favela. In this way a culture of study and further education developed that has become a hallmark of Monte Azul.

There is a three-year in-service training programme in Waldorf education that they call by the Indian name for the [[hummingbird]]: “Mainumby”. In this way the co-workers of public organisations can train as Waldorf teachers for the accreditation of which they are currently in negotiation with the Brazilian government. In this way the ''Associação Comunitaria Monte Azul'' has become a gathering point for socially engaged people and educators. Basic training, internships, research and publication of didactic material and books, couselling in organisational, financial and professional issues for social workers, mentoring of university theses and other areas are increasingly a part of their professional involvement. A project in environmental education was implemented in collaboration with [[UNESCO]] as well as a pilot project in establishing women’s co-operatives. Besides this, each co-worker, also those with a university degree, does an apprenticeship in social work with the principle of lifelong learning in mind.

==Health==

In Monte Azul’s ''Ambulatório'' or clinic, the residents of the Favela as well as those of the neighbouring communities receive treatment free of charge. General practitioners, pediatricians, orthopaedic surgeons, dentists, psychologists and psychiatrists are available for consultation. Treatment takes place on a holistic basis extended through [[anthroposophical medicine]].

In the ''Casa Angela'', a maternity home and centre for mother-and-child health care, women and their families receive medical care and guidance through pregnancy, birth and pre and ante-natal issues throughout the first year of the child. The Casa Angela is the first officially licensed [[birthing centre]] in Brazil. It aims to improve the poor level of obstetrics care for low-income families and resist the extremely high rate of caesarians in Brazil.

The ''Casa da Trilha'' treats people with addiction and psychiatric problems. Besides this, Monte Azul is a partner of the city of São Paulo in the programme ''Estratégia Saúde da Família'', being responsible for the municipality of São Luís in which live some 320,000 people. The aim of the programme is to try to improve the general medical care of the population.

==Environmental education==
[[File:Orta.JPG|thumbnail|left|Bio-dynamic garden in Horizonte Azul that provides the Associação Comunitária Monte Azul with its fruit and vegetables.]]

From the beginning, environmental awareness played a central role. Fruit and vegetables are grown in Horizonte Azul without the use of pesticides and are delivered to the kitchens at Monte Azul, ensuring a balanced and healthy diet for the children.

By organising community projects the residents of Monte Azul cleared the area of garbage, introduced re-cycling and built a sewerage system. In spite of there being no municipal re-cycling the Favela independently runs a centre where garbage collectors  (''Catadores'') can deliver their waste. They have entered into a collaboration on waste research with the [[Technical University of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tuglobal.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/projekt-laps-go/|title=Projekt Lap’s go|work=Zusammenarbeit Entwickeln}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural centre ==

In all three areas of activity of the Associação there are stage and dance performances, musical and other artistic presentations. In the ''Centro Cultural Monte Azul'' the residents of the Favela and neighbouring suburbs direct their own productions. They can attend concerts, plays and shows of well-known Brazilian and international artists, usually about eight to ten per month.

Besides the productions, courses in dance and sport are offered. Associação hires drama teachers and actors who stage professional productions in theatre workshops with the Favela residents that they normally perform twice a year.

== Concept and co-worker guidance ==

Once a month all 260 co-workers meet (without the co-workers of the primary health care centres) in one of the three Favelas, mostly in the Cultural Centre of Monte Azul for enrichment and art courses and for cultural exchange. Mostly something from the work of Waldorf education is presented and performed. New co-workers and new international volunteers are welcomed or wished goodbye if their period of service has come to an end.

Through these regular meetings a feeling of community and the vision of its activities is cultivated and through creative activities new solutions are found for existing problems. Every second week the co-workers of each Favela meet internally for an afternoon of similar activities.

To a large extent the organisation has been structured without a hierarchy and is led by a process of consensus. This means that all co-workers can be a party to decisions and take responsibility for the whole. Within this structure aspects of Joseph Beuys’s “[[Social Sculpture]]" and the ideas on [[Social threefolding]] of [[Rudolf Steiner]] are realised. In this sense each co-worker is free within his or her own sphere of work and can shape it in the manner he or she feels comfortable with. In addition, further work on Waldorf education is studied.

'''Bernard d'Espagnat''' (22 August 1921 – 1 August 2015) was a French theoretical [[physicist]], [[philosopher of science]], and author, best known for his work on the nature of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LE CARNET DU JOUR|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/carnet_du_jour/05-08-15_FIGARO.PDF|publisher=lefigaro|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11812157/Bernard-dEspagnat-physicist-obituary.html Bernard d’Espagnat, physicist - obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Quote'': "The doctrine that the world is made up of objects whose existence is independent of human [[consciousness]] turns out to be in conflict with [[quantum mechanics]] and with facts established by experiment."&lt;ref&gt;D'Espagnat, Bernard, [http://www.sciam.com/media/pdf/197911_0158.pdf "The Quantum Theory and Reality,"] ''[[Scientific American]]'', Nov. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
d'Espagnat was born on August 22, 1921 in Fourmagnac, France, but spent most of his early years in Paris, where his father, a post-impressionist painter, and mother imbued him with a love of classic literature and the arts. Attending some of the finest{{peacock term|date=May 2017}} schools in Paris, he was drawn to the humanities, especially philosophy.  Despite his love of philosophy, d'Espagnat focused on science and mathematics, believing that advances in philosophy would require the knowledge and practice of contemporary science.

In 1939, as d'Espagnat made plans to enter the [[Ecole Polytechnique]], World War II put his education on hold.&lt;ref name="JTF"&gt;[http://www.templetonprize.org/currentwinner.html BioDetails from] [[John Templeton Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
D'Espagnat obtained his Ph.D. from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] at the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] under the guidance of [[Louis de Broglie]]. He was a researcher at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique [[CNRS]], 1947-57. During this period he also worked with [[Enrico Fermi]] in Chicago, 1951–52, and on a research project led by [[Niels Bohr]] at the Institute in Copenhagen, 1953-54. He then pursued his scientific career as the first theoretical physicist, at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([[CERN]]) in Geneva, 1954-59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perret|first1=Florent|title=Archives of Theory Division and Theory Group (Copenhagen)|url=http://library.web.cern.ch/archives/CERN_archive/guide/theory/isath|website=CERN Scientific Information Service: Archives|publisher=CERN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Faces and places: Jacques Prentki 1920–2009|journal=CERN Courier|date=March 2010|volume=50|issue=2|page=35|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1734489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1959 until his retirement in 1987, D'Espagnat was a senior lecturer at the Faculty of Sciences at the [[Sorbonne University]]. He was director of the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics and Elementary Particles at the [[University of Paris XI]] (Orsay), 1980-87. He was a visiting professor at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]  in 1977, and at the [[University of California - Santa Barbara]] in 1984.

He has been a member of the Brussels [[International Academy of the Philosophy of Science]] since 1975, and of the French [[Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]] since 1996. His experiments with [[Bell's theorem|Bell's inequalities]] to further his concept of  veiled reality won the attention of the [[John Templeton Foundation]]. D'Espagnat became the 2009 [[Templeton Prize]] winner in March for his "work which acknowledges that science cannot fully explain 'the nature of being.'"&lt;ref&gt;Gefter, Amanda [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16769-concept-of-hypercosmic-god-wins-templeton-prize/ "Concept of 'hypercosmic God' wins Templeton Prize,"] ''The New Scientist'', Mar. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templetonprize.org/currentwinner.html |title=Templeton prize: Current winner, 2009 |accessdate=2013-08-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319075251/http://www.templetonprize.org/currentwinner.html |archivedate=2009-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical outlook==
D'Espagnat remained troubled by the scant attention most physicists paid to the interpretational questions raised by [[quantum mechanics]]. His first book, ''Conceptions of Contemporary Physics'' (1965), asked these questions and sketched possible resolutions, underscoring his insistence that scientists face the issues raised by their own pursuits.

Subsequently, d'Espagnat was an early interpreter of the deep philosophical significance of experimental research agendas in quantum physics. In his 1979 Scientific American article, "The Quantum Theory and Reality," and best-selling 1979 book, ''À la recherche du réel, le regard d'un physicien'' (''In Search of Reality, the Outlook of a Physicist''), he encouraged physicists and philosophers to think afresh about questions long considered marginal but which today serve as the foundation for new fields of research into the [[metaphysics|nature of reality]].&lt;ref name="JTF"/&gt;

In ''Le réel voilé, analyse des concepts quantiques'' (''Veiled Reality, An Analysis of Present-Day Quantum Mechanical Concepts''), d'Espagnat coined the term "veiled reality" and explained why significant experiments over the past decade had not restored conventional realism. ''On Physics and Philosophy'' (published in France in 2002 as ''Traité de physique et de philosophie'') was hailed as "surely the most complete book to have been written on this subject and one likely to last a long time…" by [[Roland Omnès]]. His most recent book is ''Candide et le physicien'' (''Candide and the Physicist''), written with Claude Saliceti and published in 2008, a layperson's guide that answers 50 questions which pinpoint and correct preconceived ideas of contemporary physics and examine the many conceptual and philosophical changes those ideas reveal.&lt;ref name="JTF"/&gt;

[[File:Coin_rotation_paradox_animation.gif|thumb|The coin rotation illusion. Although to some the moving coin appears to have made a complete revolution, its point in contact with the stationary coin at the beginning (Washington's "nose") is not in contact at the end.  It has only made a half revolution.]]

[[File:Cardioid animation.gif|thumb|The path of a single point on the edge of the moving coin is a [[cardioid]].]]
The '''coin rotation paradox''' is the counter-intuitive observation that, when one coin is rolled around the rim of another coin of equal size, the moving coin completes two full rotations after going all the way around the stationary coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Coin Paradox|urlname=CoinParadox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Start with two identical [[coin]]s touching each other on a table, with their "head" sides displayed and parallel. Keeping coin A stationary, rotate coin B around A, keeping a point of contact with no slippage. As coin B reaches the opposite side, the two heads will again be parallel; B has made one revolution. Continuing to move B brings it back to the starting position and completes a second revolution. Paradoxically, coin B has rolled a distance equal to twice its circumference. 

As coin B rotates, each point on its perimeter describes (moves through) a [[cardioid]] curve.

==Comparison==

The rolling coin actually participates in two separate motions not unlike the moon relative to the earth (except that the moon completes only one rotation about every 28 days):

* The moon rotates once while revolving around an elliptical pathway relative to true north.
* The moving coin rotates twice as it revolves around the center of the other (still) coin.

'''Daniel N. Robinson''' (March 9, 1937 – September 17, 2018)&lt;ref&gt;[http://commentary.jameswilsoninstitute.org/2018/09/remembering-daniel-nicholas-robinson-1937-2018/ Remembering Daniel Nicholas Robinson (1937-2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American philosopher who was a [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] at [[Georgetown University]] and a [[fellow]] of the faculty of philosophy at [[Oxford University]].

== Career ==
Robinson has published in a wide variety of subjects, including [[moral philosophy]], the [[philosophy of psychology]], [[legal philosophy]], the [[philosophy of the mind]], [[intellectual history]], [[legal history]], and the [[history of psychology]]. He has held academic positions at [[Amherst College]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Princeton University]], and [[Columbia University]]. In addition, he served as the principal consultant to [[PBS]] and the [[BBC]] for their award-winning series "The Brain" and "The Mind", and he lectured for [[The Great Courses]]' series on Philosophy. He is on the Board of Consulting Scholars of Princeton University's James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jmp.princeton.edu/about/people/james-madison-society|title=James Madison Society {{!}} James Madison Program|website=jmp.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a Senior Fellow of [[BYU]]'s Wheatley Institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wheatley.byu.edu/the-wheatley-institution-organization/|title=The Wheatley Institution {{!}} Organization|website=wheatley.byu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he received the Gittler Award&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/apf/funding/gittler.aspx?tab=4|title=APF Joseph B.

"

== Primary interests ==
Robinson’s interests range over the brain sciences, philosophy, law and intellectual history. Several of his works are illustrative of these interests. Regarded as a classic in its field, his ''An Intellectual History of Psychology''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Daniel N.|title=An intellectual history of psychology|date=1995|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, WI|isbn=978-0-299-14844-7|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was praised by [[Ernest Hilgard]] for its “…development of ideas as they provide alternative perspectives on the nature of mind…The reader is carried along on a genuine intellectual adventure."&lt;ref name="University of Wisconsin Press"&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Wisconsin Press|url=http://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/0136.htm.|accessdate=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Robinson’s enduring interest in Aristotle’s thought is summarized in ''Aristotle’s Psychology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Daniel N.|title=Aristotle's psychology|date=1999|publisher=Joe Christensen Inc.|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0-9672066-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Deborah Modrak described as “Easy to read and informative” predicting that it would “no doubt prompt readers to reflect on the relevance of Aristotle’s work to modern psychology…” (International Studies in Philosophy, Volume 23, Issue 3, 1991; pp.&amp;nbsp;142–143). In this connection, Robinson was among the small group assembled by [[Martin Seligman]] in 1999 to develop the framework for Positive Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/posclinpsychchap.htm|title=Positive Clinical Psychology|date=2014-10-01|access-date=2017-09-02|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001132438/http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/posclinpsychchap.htm|archivedate=2014-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Wild Beasts and Idle Humours'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Daniel N.|title=Wild beasts &amp; idle humours : the insanity defense from antiquity to the present|date=1998|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-674-95290-4|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson offers a treatise on the relationship between science and jurisprudence as this developed from ancient to contemporary times.  Michael Perlin describes the book as “truly unique. It synthesizes material that I do not believe has ever been considered in this context, and links up the historical past with contemporaneous values and politics. Robinson effortlessly weaves religious history, literary history, medical history, and political history, and demonstrates how the insanity defense cannot be fully understood without consideration of all these sources.”   Robert Kinscherff states that it “…reads like the inner workings of a fascinating and disciplined narrative mind.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674952904&amp;content=reviews|title=Wild Beasts and Idle Humours — Daniel N. Robinson {{!}} Harvard University Press|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson’s major work in moral philosophy is ''Praise and Blame: Moral Realism and Its Application''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Daniel N.|title=Praise and blame : moral realism and its application|date=2002|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=978-0-691-05724-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the book in Review of  Metaphysics, Jude P. Dougherty writes, “The richness of this work cannot be comprehended in one reading.  Whether the reader agrees or not with the author, one has much to learn from the profundity of Robinson's insight into the framing of moral judgment”.  (Rev. Metaphys., 2003, vol. 56, 899-900.)

Central to Robinson’s concerns are the conceptual and philosophical foundations of psychology and related subjects.

'''Dark retreat''' ({{bo|w=mun mtshams}}&lt;ref name="Allione, Tsultrim 2007"&gt;Allione, Tsultrim (2000). ''Women of Wisdom''. (Includes transcribed interview with [[Namkhai Norbu]]) Source: [http://www.khandro.net/book-womenofwisdom.htm] (accessed: November 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;) is a solo retreat in a space that is completely absent of light, which is an advanced practices in the [[Dzogchen]] lineages of the [[Nyingmapa]], [[Bönpo]], and other schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The time period dedicated to dark retreat varies from a few hours to decades.  Dark retreat in the Himalayan tradition is a restricted practice only to be engaged by the senior spiritual practitioner under appropriate spiritual guidance. This practice is considered conducive for navigating the [[bardo]] at the time of death and for realising the  [[rainbow body]].  The traditional dark retreat requires stability in the [[rigpa|natural state]] and is only suitable for advanced practitioners.  [[Ayu Khandro]] and [[Dilgo Khyentse]] are examples of modern, if not contemporary, practitioners of significant periods of dark retreat [[sadhana]].

== History ==
Some spiritual traditions have used similar techniques in the pursuit of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]: [[Kogi people]] spend 9 years in dark caves or huts in Colombia, in Europe, the dark room appeared as a network of [[tunnel]]s, in Egypt in the galleries of the [[Egyptian pyramids|Pyramids]], and in Rome as the catacombs. The Essenes in Israel and Daoists in China used [[cave]]s. Ancient Greeks practiced the oracular discipline of enkoimesis or [[incubatio]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Czech Television reporter, ''Silvie Dymáková'' (winner of the main prize for documentary filmmaking in the Czech Republic "Czech Lion award"), documented a week in dark retreat.

[[Ayu Khandro]] performed the ''Yang-Ti'' (Tibetan), an advanced practice of the Dzogchen [[Menngagde|Upadesha]], a version of the Dark Retreat.&lt;ref name="Allione, Tsultrim 2007"/&gt;

'''Ernst Bergmann''' (7 August 1881, [[Colditz]], [[Kingdom of Saxony]] – 16 April 1945, [[Naumburg]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] and proponent of [[Nazism]].

==Biography==
Bergmann studied philosophy and [[German philology]] at the [[University of Leipzig]] and got his PhD in 1905. Subsequently, he continued his studies in Berlin. Later he returned to Leipzig, where he received the status of [[Privatdozent]] at the university in 1911. In 1916 he was awarded the position of Ausserordentlicher Professor (professor without chair). He developed a religious philosophy with mystical aspects. Later he embraced the ideas of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] and became one of its prominent academic propagators. He officially joined the Nazi Party in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Sherratt, ''Hitler's Philosophers'', Yale University Press, 2013, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

His works ''Die deutsche Nationalkirche'' (the German National Church) and ''Die natürliche Geistlehre'' (The Natural Doctrine of the Spirit) were placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'', the [[Roman Catholic]] list of banned books, in 1934 and 1937.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=182}}

In his theology work ''Die 25 Thesen der Deutschreligion'' (Twenty-five Points of the German Religion), he held that the [[Old Testament]] and portions of the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]] were unsuitable for use in Germany. He claimed that [[Jesus]] was of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] descent and that he was not a Jew. Bergmann described [[Adolf Hitler]] as the new messiah.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=182}}

In 1945, he committed suicide after the Allied forces captured Leipzig.

The '''evolution of photosynthesis''' refers to the origin and subsequent evolution of [[photosynthesis]], the process by which light energy synthesizes [[sugar]]s from [[carbon dioxide]], releasing [[oxygen]] as a waste product. The process of photosynthesis was discovered by Jan Ingenhousz, a Dutch-born British physician and scientist, first publishing about it in 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jan-Ingenhousz |title=Jan Ingenhousz {{!}} Biography, Experiments, &amp; Facts |work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first photosynthetic organisms probably [[evolution|evolved]] early in the [[evolutionary history of life]] and most likely used [[reducing agent]]s such as [[hydrogen]] or  electrons, rather than water.&lt;ref name="pmid16453059"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Photosynthesis in the Archean era | journal=Photosynthesis Research | volume=88 | issue=2 | pages=109–17 |date=May 2006 | pmid=16453059 | doi=10.1007/s11120-006-9040-5  | last1=Olson | first1=JM}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three major [[metabolic pathway]]s by which photosynthesis is carried out: [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis]], [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis]], and [[CAM photosynthesis]]. C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis is the oldest and most common form. C3 is a plant that uses the calvin cycle for the initial steps that incorporate CO2 into organic material. C4 is a plant that prefaces the calvin cycle with reactions that incorporate CO2 into four-carbon compounds. CAM is a plant that uses crassulacean acid metabolism, an adaptation for photosynthesis in arid conditions. C4 and CAM Plants have special adaptations that save water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cropsreview.com/types-of-photosynthesis.html|title=Types of Photosynthesis: C3, C4 and CAM|work=CropsReview.Com|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early photosynthetic systems, such as those from [[Green sulfur bacteria|green]] and [[Purple sulfur bacteria|purple sulfur]] and [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|green]] and [[purple bacteria|purple nonsulfur bacteria]], are thought to have been anoxygenic, using various molecules as [[electron donor]]s.

The main source of [[oxygen]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is [[Oxygen evolution|oxygenic photosynthesis]], and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the [[oxygen catastrophe]]. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in [[cyanobacteria]], became important during the [[Paleoproterozoic]] era around 2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor, which is [[Redox|oxidized]] to molecular oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}) in the [[photosynthetic reaction center]].

==Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts==
[[File:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|150px|left|Plant cells with visible chloroplasts (from a moss, ''[[Plagiomnium affine]]'')]]

Several groups of animals have formed [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in [[coral]]s, [[sponge]]s and [[sea anemone]]s. It is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple [[body plan]]s and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Venn, A. A.; Loram, J. E.; Douglas, A. E. |title=Photosynthetic symbioses in animals |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=1069–80 |year=2008 |pmid=18267943 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erm328}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a few marine [[Mollusca|mollusk]]s ''[[Elysia viridis]]'' and ''[[Elysia chlorotica]]'' also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies. This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time.&lt;ref name="pmid10806222"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rumpho M. E.; Summer E. J.; Manhart J.

An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with [[cyanobacteria|photosynthetic bacteria]], including a circular [[chromosome]], prokaryotic-type [[ribosome]]s, and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center.&lt;ref name="pmid9914199"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Douglas, S.

Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], chloroplasts still possess their own DNA, separate from the [[nuclear DNA]] of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those in [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name="pmid12620099"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raven J.

The [[CoRR Hypothesis]] proposes that this '''Co'''-location is required for '''R'''edox '''R'''egulation.

A 2010 study by researchers at [[Tel Aviv University]] discovered that the [[Oriental hornet]] (''Vespa orientalis'') converts sunlight into electric power using a pigment called [[xanthopterin]]. This is the first scientific evidence of a member of the animal kingdom engaging in photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Plotkin | first1=M. | last2=Hod | first2=I. | last3=Zaban | first3=A. | last4=Boden | first4=S.

==Evolution of photosynthetic pathways==
[[File:HatchSlackpathway2.svg|thumb|300px|The C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; carbon concentrating mechanism]]
Photosynthesis is not quite as simple as adding water to {{co2}} to produce sugars and oxygen. A complex chemical pathway is involved, facilitated along the way by a range of [[enzymes]] and co-enzymes. The [[enzyme]] [[RuBisCO]] is responsible for "fixing" {{co2}}&amp;nbsp;– that is, it attaches it to a carbon-based molecule to form a sugar, which can be used by the plant, releasing an oxygen molecule along the way. However, the enzyme is notoriously inefficient, and just as effectively will also fix oxygen instead of {{co2}} in a process called [[photorespiration]]. This is energetically costly as the plant has to use energy to turn the products of photorespiration back into a form that can react with {{co2}}.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Concentrating carbon===
The [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; metabolic pathway]] is a valuable recent evolutionary innovation in plants, involving a complex set of adaptive changes to [[physiology]] and [[gene expression]] patterns.&lt;ref name="williamsjohnston"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams, B. P.; Johnston, I. G.; Covshoff, S.; Hibberd, J. M. | title=Phenotypic landscape inference reveals multiple evolutionary paths to C₄ photosynthesis | journal=eLife | volume=2 | pages=e00961 |date=September 2013 | doi=10.7554/eLife.00961 | pmid=24082995 | pmc=3786385}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7600 species of plants use {{c4}} carbon fixation, which represents about 3% of all terrestrial species of plants.  All these 7600 species are [[angiosperm]]s.

C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants evolved carbon concentrating mechanisms. These work by increasing the concentration of {{co2}} around RuBisCO, thereby facilitating photosynthesis and decreasing photorespiration. The process of concentrating {{co2}} around RuBisCO requires more energy than allowing gases to [[diffusion|diffuse]], but under certain conditions&amp;nbsp;– i.e. warm temperatures (&gt;25&amp;nbsp;°C), low {{co2}} concentrations, or high oxygen concentrations&amp;nbsp;– pays off in terms of the decreased loss of sugars through photorespiration.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

One type of C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; metabolism employs a so-called [[Kranz anatomy]]. This transports {{co2}} through an outer mesophyll layer, via a range of organic molecules, to the central bundle sheath cells, where the {{co2}} is released. In this way, {{co2}} is concentrated near the site of RuBisCO operation. Because RuBisCO is operating in an environment with much more {{co2}} than it otherwise would be, it performs more efficiently.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

A second mechanism, [[CAM photosynthesis]], is a [[carbon fixation]] pathway that evolved in some [[plant]]s as an adaptation to [[arid]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

The stomata open at night to collect {{co2}}, which is stored as the four-carbon acid [[malic acid|malate]], and then used during [[photosynthesis]] during the day. The pre-collected {{co2}} is concentrated around the enzyme [[RuBisCO]], increasing [[photosynthetic efficiency]]. More {{co2}} is then harvested from the atmosphere when stomata open, during the cool, moist nights, reducing water loss.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Evolutionary record===

These two pathways, with the same effect on RuBisCO, evolved a number of times independently&amp;nbsp;– indeed, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; alone arose 62 times in 18 different plant [[family (biology)|families]].  A number of 'pre-adaptations' seem to have paved the way for C4, leading to its clustering in certain clades: it has most frequently been innovated in plants that already had features such as extensive vascular bundle sheath tissue.&lt;ref name="Christin2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Christin | first1=P. -A. | last2=Osborne | first2=C.

Isotopic markers are used to deduce their distribution and significance.

C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants preferentially use the lighter of two [[isotopes]] of carbon in the atmosphere, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, which is more readily involved in the chemical pathways involved in its fixation. Because C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; metabolism involves a further chemical step, this effect is accentuated. Plant material can be [[mass spectrometry|analysed]] to deduce the ratio of the heavier &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C. This ratio is denoted {{delta|13|C}}. C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants are on average around 14‰ (parts per thousand) lighter than the atmospheric ratio, while C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants are about 28‰ lighter. The {{delta|13|C}} of CAM plants depends on the percentage of carbon fixed at night relative to what is fixed in the day, being closer to C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants if they fix most carbon in the day and closer to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants if they fix all their carbon at night.&lt;ref name="isotope"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1310735 |last=O'Leary |first=Marion |date=May 1988 |title=Carbon Isotopes in Photosynthesis |journal=BioScience |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=328–336 |jstor=1310735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is troublesome procuring original fossil material in sufficient quantity to analyse the grass itself, but fortunately there is a good proxy: horses. Horses were globally widespread in the period of interest, and browsed almost exclusively on grasses. There's an old phrase in [[isotope palæontology]], "you are what you eat (plus a little bit)"&amp;nbsp;– this refers to the fact that organisms reflect the isotopic composition of whatever they eat, plus a small adjustment factor. There is a good record of horse teeth throughout the globe, and their {{delta|13|C}} has been measured. The record shows a sharp negative inflection around {{Ma|6|7}}, during the Messinian, and this is interpreted as the rise of C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants on a global scale.&lt;ref name=Retallack1997&gt;{{cite journal| first=G.

===When is C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; an advantage?===

'''Functional structuralism''' is a spin-off from [[systems theory]] in [[sociology]]. Systems theory, following [[Talcott Parsons]], began as a [[structural functionalism|structural-functionalist]] theory, that is, [[social structure]]s were stressed and placed at the center of analysis, and [[social function]]s were deduced from these structures. In functional-structuralist theory, in contrast, the initial focus is on the function of an aspect of society, and only after functions have been specified are enabling structures designated.

The '''Great Unity''' ({{zh|c=大同|p=dàtóng}}) is a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[utopia]]n vision of the world in which everyone and everything is at peace. It is found in classical [[Chinese philosophy]] which has been invoked many times in the modern [[history of China]].&lt;ref&gt;https://kidspiritonline.com/magazine/unity-and-division/great-unity&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The notion of the "Great Unity" appeared in the "Lǐyùn" (禮運) chapter of the ''[[Book of Rites]]'', one of the Confucian [[Chinese classics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pearce|2001|loc=169}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cheng|2009|loc=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to it, the society in Great Unity was ruled by the public, where the people chose men of virtue and ability, and valued trust and harmony. People did not only love their own parents and children, but also secured the living of the elderly until their ends, let the adults be of use to the society, and helped the young grow. Those who were widowed, orphaned, childless, handicapped and diseased were all taken care of. Men took their responsibilities and women had their homes. People disliked seeing resources being wasted but did not seek to possess them; they wanted to exert their strength but did not do it for their own benefit. Therefore, selfish thoughts were dismissed, people refrained from stealing and robbery, and the outer doors remained open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ctext.org/liji/li-yun|title=Book of Rites, Li Yun chapter, paragraph 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was used by [[Kang Youwei]] in his visionary utopian treatise, ''The Book of Great Unity'' ({{zh|c=大同書}}).&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Albert H. Y., The Concept of 'Datong' in Chinese Philosophy as an Expression of the Idea of the Common Good (November 11, 2011). University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law Research Paper No. 2011/020. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1957955 "In the early twentieth century, the great Chinese thinker and reformer Kang Youwei wrote a book entitled Datong shu (Book on the Great Community) in which he put forward an original and radical interpretation of 'datong'."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Unity is also often mentioned in the writings of [[Sun Yat-sen]] and is included in his lyrics of the [[National Anthem of the Republic of China|National Anthem of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]].

This ideology can be reflected in the following examples, each from a national anthem of the Republic of China (Taiwan):

* {{lang|zh-tw|「三民主義，吾黨所宗，以建民國，以進'''大同'''。」}} (literal translation: "[[Three Principles of the People]], the aim of us, to build the Republic, to advance into Great Unity.") - [[National Anthem of the Republic of China]] 
* {{lang|zh-tw|「毋自暴自棄，毋故步自封，光我民族，促進'''大同'''。」}}(literal translation: "Never abandon in desperation, nor being complacent with achievement; Glorify our nation and work promoting Great Unity.") - [[National Flag Anthem of the Republic of China]]

'''Harald Frithjof Seiersted Ofstad''' (13 October 1920 &amp;ndash; 5 October 1994) was a Norwegian moral philosopher. He was Professor in Applied Philosophy at [[Stockholm University]] for more than 30 years.

Born in [[Bergen]], the youngest son of a high-ranking police officer, Ofstad passed the [[examen artium]] in 1939 and completed a degree in law in 1945 before changing to philosophy, which he studied under [[Arne Næss]]; he was part of the "Bergen group"&lt;ref name=NBL&gt;{{cite web |author=Christopher Hals Gylseth |url=http://nbl.snl.no/Harald_Ofstad/utdypning |title=Harald Ofstad: utdypning |work=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=5 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most prominent exponents of Næss' "empirical semantics" approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Jon Elster |jstor=41090500 |title=L'état actuel des études philosophiques en Norvège |work=Revue Philosophique de la France et de l'Étranger |volume=158 |year=1968 |language=French |pages=487&amp;ndash;89 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[cand. mag.]] in philosophy in 1946, studied in the United States at [[Yale University]] and other institutions as a [[Rockefeller Fellow]] in 1947&amp;ndash;49, and was a University Fellow at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1949&amp;ndash;54.&lt;ref name=NBL/&gt; He was appointed to a professorship in philosophy at the [[University of Bergen]] in 1954, but after only one year took a position as professor of applied philosophy at Stockholm University, where he remained until his retirement in 1987. He then returned to Bergen. He died in Oslo in 1994.

He married Erna Magnussen, a historian of literature, in 1945, and published a collection of essays with her in 1961.&lt;ref name=NBL/&gt;

Ofstad's interest in philosophy arose out of his encounter with [[Nazism]] during [[World War II]], when [[German occupation of Norway|Norway was occupied by Nazi Germany]]. He interpreted Nazism as a manifestation of the human tendency to feel contempt for weakness, a viewpoint which he developed in his 1971 book ''Vår forakt for svakhet'' (Our Contempt for Weakness).&lt;ref name=NBL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Torbjörn Tännsjö |title=Is it Fascistoid to Admire Sports Heroes? |work=Values in Sport: Elitism, Nationalism, Gender Equality, and the Scientific Manufacture of Winners |editor1=Torbjörn Tännsjö |editor2=Claudio Tamburrini |location=London/New York |publisher=Spon |year=2000 |isbn=9780203184691 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tqw-CTCHE0YC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Harald+Ofstad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O1kzUqnTJ4K5igLq2IDAAw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Harald%20Ofstad&amp;f=false |page=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Described as "thought-provoking" and applied to ageism in {{Cite book |author=Lars Tornstam |title=Gerotranscendence: A Developmental Theory of Positive Aging |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |isbn=9780826131348 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J8871LEGDagC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Harald+Ofstad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JVczUpXqDobKiwLKmYDgBA&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Harald%20Ofstad&amp;f=false |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of his generation, influenced by American social scientists and such thinkers as [[Theodor W. Adorno]], he sought the origins of authoritarianism and nationalism.&lt;ref name=NBL/&gt; He was one of the most cited Norwegian moral philosophers and participated actively in the public debate in both Norway and Sweden; in 1978 he forcefully disagreed with [[Thorkild Hansen]] over the latter's book ''Processen mod Hamsun'' in a debate televised on [[NRK]].&lt;ref name=NBL/&gt;

{{Confuse|intensive and extensive properties}}
An '''intrinsic''' property is a property of a system or of a material itself or within. It is independent of how much of the material is present and is independent of the form of the material, e.g., one large piece or a collection of small particles. Intrinsic properties are dependent mainly on the chemical composition or structure of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Packaging Engineering (IFNHH, Massey University, NZ)&lt;/ref&gt;

A property that is not essential or inherent is called an '''extrinsic''' property. For example, [[density]] is an intrinsic property of any [[Physical body|physical object]], whereas '''belonging to something''' is an extrinsic property that depends on another object.

'''Jacen Solo''' is a [[fictional character]] in literature based on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, continuity.

The son of [[Han Solo]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa Solo]] and the nephew of [[Luke Skywalker]], he is a major character in several novels, particularly the ''[[New Jedi Order]]'' series. He becomes the antagonist of the ''[[Legacy of the Force]]'' series under the name '''Darth Caedus'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Jacen's other familial connections of note to his native continuity include being the brother of [[Jaina Solo]] and [[Anakin Solo]] as well as the cousin of [[Ben Skywalker]]. [[Kylo Ren]] from the later, altered/mixed timeline, [[Disney]]-produced sequel films is also seemingly based in part on the character.

==Fictional history==
===Childhood===
Jacen is introduced in the 1993 novel ''[[The Last Command (novel)|The Last Command]]'', the third installment of the [[Thrawn trilogy|''Thrawn'' trilogy]], when he is born five minutes after his sister [[Jaina Solo|Jaina]] on [[Coruscant]].&lt;ref name="EW 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/11/02/star-wars-sequels-timothy-zahn/|title=''Star Wars'' sequel author Timothy Zahn weighs in on new movie plans|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|date=November 2, 2012 |accessdate=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Last Command"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Last Command (novel)|The Last Command]] |date=1993 |first=Timothy |last=Zahn |authorlink=Timothy Zahn |publisher=[[Bantam Spectra]] |isbn=0-553-09186-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twins, and eventually their younger brother [[Anakin Solo|Anakin]], were sent to live at various safe havens, under the protection of Leia's handmaiden, [[Winter (Star Wars)|Winter]].

In ''[[Jedi Search]]'', the twins returned to Coruscant at age three and had many adventures there. They once got lost in the underworld of Imperial City with [[C-3PO]], but were quickly rescued and returned to their mother, the [[Chief of State]] of the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]].

In ''[[The Crystal Star]]'', all three children were abducted, together with many other children with [[the Force|Force]] abilities, by Hethrir, who tried to [[Brainwashing|brainwash]] them into becoming [[Dark Jedi]] in order to bring about the rebirth of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. The children defeated their captor.

===Jedi Academy years===

In the ''[[Young Jedi Knights]]'' series, Jacen travels to Yavin 4 with his sister to begin his Jedi training. Jacen discovers a strong connection to the Living Force &amp;mdash; the concentration on the present moment &amp;mdash; and can communicate with and calm many of the jungle creatures near the Academy. He even keeps a small menagerie of animals in his room in the Great [[List of Star Wars races (K-O)#Massassi|Massassi]] Temple. He and his sister befriend the [[Wookiee]] [[List of New Order Jedi characters#L|Lowbacca]] (nicknamed Lowie by his friends) and the warrior princess [[List of New Order Jedi characters#K|Tenel Ka]].

In ''[[Heirs of the Force]]'' and ''[[Shadow Academy]]'', Jacen and Jaina discover a crashed [[TIE fighter]] from the Battle of Yavin. Jaina installs a hyperdrive in the downed starfighter and begins fixing it to fly again. Jacen, Lowbacca, and Tenel Ka help her to practice their Force skills until all are held captive by the TIE's original pilot, Qorl, who had been living in the jungle for two decades. They eventually escape, but so does Qorl, leaving the jungle moon behind and searching for any remnants of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. Qorl discovers the Shadow Academy, a training ground for Dark Jedi commanded by one of Luke Skywalker's fallen students, [[List of Star Wars Legends characters#Brakiss|Brakiss]], along with the remains of the [[Dathomir]]i [[Nightsisters]]. These elements of the so-called Second Imperium kidnap Jacen, Jaina and Lowbacca, but they resist the dark side and are rescued by Luke Skywalker and Tenel Ka.

The friends return to Coruscant for a short vacation, and are reunited with the twins' childhood friend [[Zekk (Star Wars)|Zekk]]. They are forced to fight Jacen and Jaina several times, and the twins and their friends finally progress far enough to be tasked with building their first lightsabers. Jacen uses a corusca gem he had gained earlier for his focusing crystal.

Jacen's hard-learned lesson hits home once again in ''[[Lightsabers (novel)|Lightsabers]]'', when Tenel Ka rushes to complete her lightsaber to keep up with her friends. She uses an imperfect crystal and her blade shorts out in a sparring match with Jacen. His lightsaber passes through thin air where her weapon had been seconds before and severs the young woman's arm. Though she bears him no ill will for the accident, Jacen is wracked with guilt.

In ''[[Darkest Knight]]'', the twins and Tenel Ka go to [[Kashyyyk]] with Lowbacca to witness his sister's adulthood rites. In ''[[Jedi Under Siege]]'', the Jedi trainees and the Shadow Academy have their final confrontation on Yavin 4. The twins, with help from Luke and Zekk, bring down the Shadow Academy and the Second Imperium forever.

Throughout the series, Jacen and Jaina continue their training at Yavin 4, meeting new friends like [[Raynar Thul]]. They cannot convince Zekk to stay at the Academy with them, but Jacen and Jaina remain friends with him. With his and Raynar's help, they discover a threat to the New Republic: the Diversity Alliance, an alien, anti-human group. The Alliance is building up massive support among peoples that had been oppressed by the Empire. They are led by a [[Twi'lek]] Nolaa Tarkona, the sister of [[Minor residents of Tatooine#Oola|Oola]], who was murdered by [[Jabba the Hutt]] in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.

In ''[[Jedi Bounty]]'', Jacen, Jaina, and their friends are briefly held captive on [[Ryloth]] and have to escape to its harsh surface. They have gone there in an attempt to rescue Lowbacca, who had misguidedly joined the anti-human Diversity Alliance. In the following book, ''[[The Emperor's Plague]]'', they get to the bottom of a plot they had suspected all along, and catch up with Raynar's father, Bornan Thul, to race the Diversity Alliance fleet to an Imperial storehouse hidden in the deep core. There is hidden a supply of deadly diseases created by [[List of minor Star Wars villains#Derricote, General Evir|General Evir Derricote]] almost two decades before. Tarkona wishes to unleash a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] against humans and wipe them all out, but the Jedi and Alliance dissidents defeat her. She succumbs to one of the diseases herself on a faraway planet. Bornan Thul dies from one of the plagues right before his son's eyes.

In ''[[Return to Ord Mantell]]'', they go on a trip with their father to the titular planet to watch a race. There, they run into Czethros, a bounty hunter who once hunted Han. They are ambushed by [[w:C:starwars:Black Sun|Black Sun]] agents, but are helped by Anja Gallandro, a young woman who wields a lightsaber, though she is not a Jedi. Although attracted to Tenel Ka, Jacen becomes infatuated with the older woman. Anja had blamed Han Solo for killing her father, but Solo reveals that her father died in a trap while finding treasure.

In ''[[Trouble on Cloud City]]'', they discover Czethros is a minor leader of Black Sun, and is trying to gather enough power to overcome the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]]. Jacen, Tenel Ka, and Lowbacca are ambushed by several Black Sun [[mercenary|mercenaries]], and Jacen is almost killed.

In ''[[Crisis at Crystal Reef]]'', Jaina attempts to help [[Kessel (Star Wars)|Kessel]] and capture Czetheros while Jacen rushes to help Anja with her spice addiction and help her with Black Sun. With help, Anja beats her addiction and accepts her father's death. Jacen thinks Anja has Jedi potential, but it turns out she didn't. He gets over his infatuation with Anja when she goes to work for Lando.

===Yuuzhan Vong War===
In the ''[[New Jedi Order]]'' series, Luke takes Jacen as his Jedi apprentice. Jacen learns much from Luke, though they disagree on many philosophical issues. Jacen believes in the Force not only as a tool, but as part of something greater. He tells his brother Anakin that the Force is a guide to find one's place in [[destiny]].

When the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] attack the New Republic in ''[[Dark Tide: Onslaught]]'', Jacen comes to believe that many Jedi are handling the threat too aggressively. He abandons his powers temporarily to contemplate the Force and butts heads with his father over the morality of 'pirate' attacks on Peace Brigade vessels. Only his love for his mother brings Jacen back into the front lines of the battle. Eventually, Han and Jacen make their peace, the former declaring that while he doesn't always understand his son, he is proud of him.

In ''[[Star by Star]]'' Jacen joins a daring mission to [[Myrkr]]. A Jedi strike force, led by Anakin, is to infiltrate a Yuuzhan Vong [[cloning]] facility where the invaders craft deadly Jedi-hunting beasts called [[Voxyn]]. The mission is a disaster, ending with Anakin's death, in which Jaina reacts by touching the dark side of the Force. Forced into the leadership position, Jacen uses the [[Force Meld]] to bind the team together into a cohesive fighting unit. After destroying the voxyn queen, Jacen is captured by the Yuuzhan Vong army under the command of [[Vergere (character)|Vergere]] and [[Nom Anor]]. Jacen disappears, along with his presence in the Force.

In ''[[Traitor (Star Wars novel)|Traitor]]'', Jacen awakes to find himself in the Embrace of Pain, a rack-like [[torture]] device favored by the Yuuzhan Vong. The torture nearly breaks Jacen's spirit, until he learns to use the pain he suffers to sustain himself. He remains under the care and tutelage of the avian Vergere, who he learns had once been a Jedi of the [[Old Republic (Star Wars)|Old Republic]], and who had even met his grandfather, [[Anakin Skywalker]].
He is put to work on Yuuzhan Vong ship, where he uses a number of herbs to heal slaves and get his captors to trust him. Using the implanted slave seed beneath his flesh as a conduit, Jacen communicates with the living instruments of Yuuzhan Vong technology. He uses this connection to stage a daring escape from captivity, commanding Yuuzhan Vong [[amphistaff]]s to surround him like living armor.

Jacen and Vergere flee to Coruscant. The planet's entire surface is undergoing a radical transformation. Yuuzhan Vong organic growths cover the once gleaming [[metropolis]], remaking the planet into a Yuuzhan Vong paradise. The world is to be their new capital, a recreation of the planet that had spawned them, [[Yuuzhan'tar]].

Vergere removes the [[slavery|slave]] seed from Jacen, but he can still sense the Yuuzhan Vong. Jacen is later surrounded by Yuuzhan Vong warriors whom Vergere had led to him. Wanting revenge, Jacen channels his hatred for Vergere into Force lightning; he is frightened by this connection to the dark side, however, and runs away. Vergere finds him in his destroyed home and gives him back full use of the Force. He is once again surrounded by Yuuzhan Vong captors; left with no choice, he surrenders and agrees to join their cause. He becomes the "khattazz al'Yun," or Avatar of God. Nom Anor intends to use Jacen to sacrifice Jaina, thus fulfilling an ancient Yuuzhan Vong [[prophecy]].

Jacen's true allegiance is his own, however. During a test of Jacen's faith, the Yuuzhan Vong orders him to sacrifice captured Jedi [[The New Jedi Order|Ganner Rhysode]]. Instead, the two Jedi turn against their captors. As Ganner holds off the Yuuzhan Vong, Jacen confronts the World Brain. The malevolent entity remembers the bond that Jacen had forged earlier, and Jacen suggests to it to work against the Yuuzhan Vong.

Ganner dies that day, though Jacen escapes with Vergere. He returns to the dwindling New Republic territories a different man: haggard, thin and hardened. He goes on a much needed vacation, but returns to frontline combat aboard the cruiser ''Ralroost''. His ability to start the Jedi Meld is a large asset to [[Kre'fey#Traest Kre'fey|Admiral Kre'fey]], and Jacen joined the Alliance Fleet with elements of [[Garm Bel Iblis]]'s forces in a large-scale deception at [[Ebaq 9]]. The battle ends in a victory, but results in Vergere's death. Her spectral form appears to him soon after.

As the newly formed Galactic Alliance emerged, Jacen accompanied his uncle Luke Skywalker into the [[Star Wars galaxy#Unknown Regions|Unknown Regions]] to seek a solution to the Yuuzhan Vong menace. Jacen would be instrumental in the search for [[Zonama Sekot]] and in the efforts to convince the living planet to join the fight against the Yuuzhan Vong. Jacen kills Supreme Overlord [[Onimi#Onimi|Onimi]], who had been using [[Supreme Overlord Shimrra]] as a puppet, in a spectacular confrontation where the Force uses Jacen as a conduit to defeat Onimi, considering that Jacen was almost killed with just one hit by Shimrra himself, and in that moment Jacen started believing that he is beyond good and evil, marking the beginning of his fall. After the grueling final confrontation and the war's end, Jacen tells Luke that he had decided to travel the galaxy to learn more about the Force.
While on his five-year journey Jacen enters a realm of the Force known as beyond shadows, thanks to his training with a sect called the Mind Walkers. 
In this realm Jacen gazes into the Pool of Knowledge that holds the Throne of Balance, (where in all future events are shown)
Jacen sees a dark man ruling the Galaxy and becomes determined to prevent this evil future. 
Following this experience, Jacen begins his descent to the dark side of the Force.

===Dark Nest Crisis===
In ''[[Dark Nest]]'', Jacen feels an urge through the Force and follows his sister to the [[Star Wars galaxy#Unknown Regions|Unknown Regions]] to help the insectoid Killik against an invading [[Chiss]] force. He returns to Republic space after his parents, resulting in his uncle and aunt to come for him, Jaina, and the other Jedi. He then travels to the Hapes Cluster to ask Tenel Ka to assist with the Chiss/Killik conflict, believing that the fleet could act as a buffer between the two armies. She obliges and sends a fleet of Hapan Battle Dragons to protect the Killiks.

In ''[[The Unseen Queen]]'', Tenel Ka gives birth to his daughter, [[List of minor Star Wars characters#Allana|Allana]], who is then attacked by the [[Gorog]]. Jacen successfully repels the attack and keeps his daughter safe. Possessed with a strong fear of his daughter or Tenel Ka being harmed, Jacen uses the Force to send Tenel Ka's grandmother (the person behind the attack) into a [[coma]]. Immediately afterward, he sees a vision of a neverending war that will destroy the galaxy, with the Killiks at the heart of it. Determined to save his daughter and the galaxy from his vision, he sets out to provoke the Chiss into destroying the Killiks. Jacen later reveals that he never knew who started the war in his vision.

In ''[[The Swarm War]]'', Luke Skywalker takes his nephew's advice so many times that he even listens when Jacen tells him that he is not ready to face [[Lomi Plo]], the Dark Queen of the Gorog. Jacen, Mara and Luke know that doubt and fear would make Lomi Plo invisible to her enemy. Jacen, along with [[R2-D2]], helps Luke conquer some of his fears about Mara's involvement with the death of his mother, and then accompanies him to face Plo.

During the fight with Plo, Luke falters for a moment when Mara is injured, and doubt enters his mind. Plo then holds him in place, unable to move. In that instant, Jacen is critically wounded by Plo while saving Mara Skywalker's life. A well-placed shot from Mara injures Plo, after which Mara tends to Jacen's wounds. While he and Mara recover, Jacen beseeches Luke to embrace his darker emotions. Luke refuses and goes back to the true Jedi way, defeating the Dark Queen and Raynar Thul without using the dark side.

In the latter novel, Jacen joins his uncle in watching holovideos of his grandparents, [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Padmé Amidala]]; in particular, he sees Anakin fall to the dark side and Padmé die in [[childbirth]] partly as a result of Anakin's treachery. (These scenes are first portrayed in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]''). Jacen actually sympathizes with Anakin's desire to protect his wife, and reminds Luke that Anakin was a fallible human being.

===Legacy of the Force===
In ''[[Betrayal (Star Wars novel)|Betrayal]]'', Jacen starts training his young cousin [[Ben Skywalker (Star Wars)|Ben]] in the ways of the Force. After a successful mission to [[Adumar]] that ends in a life-threatening attack, they return for a dinner party at his parents' new home. There, Han voices his concern over [[Corellia]] trying to gain independence. Luke orders Jacen and Ben to disable the Centerpoint Station, an ancient artifact that Corellian leader (and Han's cousin) [[Thrackan Sal-Solo]] is trying to use to his advantage. Ben disables the station while Jacen keeps Thrackan busy, ensuring the Galactic Alliance's partial victory as another fleet built in secret spoils the main attack.

While travelling to a subterranean base, Ben and Nelani, a Jedi Knight, are forced out of a mining car. Their guide, Brisha Syo creates a dark side phantom of Luke Skywalker, who attacks and very nearly kills Jacen. Eventually, Brisha stops the projections and takes Jacen to an office, where Darth Vectivus, the supposed Sith Lord they are hunting, lives. After fighting Force projections with Ben, Nelani catches up with them. Brisha is revealed to be [[Lumiya]], the [[Dark Lady of the Sith]]. She reveals that Vergere is a Sith apprentice, and that Jacen has already received Sith training. Lumiya says that Jacen is going to become the next Sith Lord. Unsure of his next move, Jacen uses the Force to create visions of the future. In each vision in which Lumiya is arrested, the galaxy is consumed in an endless war that eventually places Jacen against Luke. In the vision, Jacen kills his uncle.

Horrified, Jacen spares Lumiya. Nelani then tries to arrest the Sith, but Jacen intervenes. Jacen realizes that Nelani will, if allowed to survive, possibly fulfill the dark vision he had seen. He then fights and kills her, asking her forgiveness before striking the fatal blow. He agrees to consider what Lumiya had said and leaves the [[asteroid]] with an unconscious Ben. Jacen then erases Ben's memories of Lumiya and tells him that both she and Nelani had been killed by dark side phantoms. They return to [[Coruscant]]; however, after Jacen departs, Lumiya says that she had won.

Fully pledged to Lumiya, Jacen becomes head of the GFFA's newly formed [[secret police]], the Galactic Alliance Guard. With Ben at his side, he begins rounding up Corellians for [[internment]] and [[deportation]]. During an interrogation of a suspected assassin (who turns out to be [[Ailyn Vel]], [[Boba Fett]]'s daughter), Jacen tries to use the Force to extract information from her and kills her accidentally in the process.

Jacen also takes command of [[Rogue Squadron]] while it participates in the blockade of Corellia. He shoots down a civilian freighter that was attempting to run the blockade, and had fired on him, then relieves his sister from duty because she had refused to do it. He also uses the ''Anakin Solo'' to fire upon the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', while both his sister and his parents are on board. He believes his parents to have been involved in a failed attempt to assassinate Tenel Ka; the Solos had in fact been set up by Dur Gejjen, Prime Minister of Corellia.

In ''[[Sacrifice (Star Wars novel)|Sacrifice]]'', Lumiya says she is pleased by his progress, but instructs him that to truly become a Sith he would have to undergo the Trial of Sacrifice: to kill that which he loves most. Doing this, he believes, would allow him to use the powers of the Sith without becoming evil and would "immortalize his love" for his sacrifice. Jacen decides there is only one way to fulfill this last obstacle: he would have to kill Tenel Ka and their daughter Allana. Nevertheless, after Ben tells Mara that he overheard Jacen communicating with Lumiya, Mara tracks Jacen down in the Hapes Consortium. After a long and heated battle, Jacen kills Mara Jade; the sacrifice necessary to becoming a Sith Lord is not Jacen's love, but Ben's. Ben suspects Jacen almost immediately, upon meeting Jacen at his mother's body. Eventually, Jacen chooses the [[Darth|Sith name]] Darth Caedus.

By ''[[Fury (Star Wars novel)|Fury]]'', Darth Caedus is the principal antagonist of the series, and the declared enemy of nearly every other major character: His parents and sister have disowned him, Luke is sworn to redeem him, and Ben is driven to seek justice for his mother. In the novel, Caedus kidnaps Allana so Tenel Ka and the Hapans won't decide to leave the government, but Han, Leia, Luke, Jaina, Ben, and their allies save Allana. After saving Allana, Leia tells Caedus to become a Jedi again, but he refuses. Han and Leia later find out Allana is Caedus and Tenel Ka's child. At the end, Jaina plans to have training from Boba Fett to help her face off againast Caedus, despite her parents once being foes with Fett.

In ''[[Revelation (Star Wars novel)|Revelation]]'', Caedus takes on a new apprentice, Tahiri Veila to replace Ben and turns to the task of ending the war. He entices the Imperial Remnant to join him in an attack on the planet [[Fondor]]. Although [[List of Star Wars Legends characters#Cha Niathal|Admiral Niathal]] wants to offer the planet the chance to surrender, Caedus is determined to make an example of Fondor by crippling the shipyards and its planetary government. After previously sharing military secrets, which leads to hundreds of deaths and compromises the battle plan at Fondor, Niathal arranges a cease-fire without consulting Caedus. Enraged at this [[treason]], Caedus orders the fleet to ignore Niathal's orders and bombard the major cities. Niathal orders all ships loyal to her to attack the ''Anakin Solo''. Two-thirds of the fleet side with Caedus, while the rest ally themselves with Niathal. When the Imperial Remnant refuses to assist Caedus, his new apprentice assassinates [[Head of state|Imperial Head of State]] [[List of Star Wars Legends characters#Gilad Pellaeon|Gilad Pellaeon]] and turns control over to the Moffs who then come to aid Jacen. A mysterious fleet led by [[List of Star Wars Legends characters#Natasi Daala|Admiral Daala]], loyal to Pellaeon, appears, accompanied by one hundred [[Mandalorian]] mercenaries. and together, owing to Daala's experimental weapons, they send the Galactic Alliance Fleet into retreat.

Caedus then takes control of [[Coruscant]] and claims sole control of the Galactic Alliance.

In ''[[Invincible (Star Wars novel)|Invincible]]'', Jaina takes it upon herself to defeat her brother. Caedus's meditations are disrupted by Luke Skywalker, in an attempt to hide Jaina's attack. Jaina, accompanied by several [[Mandalorian]] commandos, confronts Caedus, who quickly dispatches the Mandalorians, while Jaina acts as a sniper. When she finally runs out of ammunition, she seizes a Mandalorian saber and severs Caedus' arm. Jaina withdraws, however, due to her own injuries. After escaping an attack led by Luke Skywalker on the bridge of the ''Anakin Solo'', Caedus sees a vision of his daughter Allana on a white throne in a time of peace. This vision convinces Caedus that he has won &amp;mdash; he would bring peace to the galaxy, and prevent his visions of war and suffering from coming true.

At the book's [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Caedus and Jaina face off in a final lightsaber duel aboard Caedus' flagship, the ''Anakin Solo''. In the midst of the duel, Caedus comes back to the light and attempts to persuade Jaina of his intentions to protect Tenel Ka and Allana. Jaina refuses to listen, however, and attacks him after he deactivates and holsters his lightsaber. She later slams the door shut in his face when he tries to leave the fight. After a grueling battle in which both are seriously injured, Jacen is defeated when Jaina severs his [[Achilles tendon]] and stabs him in the [[heart]]. As he dies, Jacen reaches out to both his former lover and his child through the Force, warning them to flee from an approaching [[biological warfare|bio-warfare]] attack designed by the Imperial Remnant to kill them. In this act of selflessness, Jaina sees the remnants of the good man her brother had once been. Following Caedus's death and the war's end, the Galactic Alliance emerges victorious over the Confederation and peace is restored to the galaxy, just as Jacen had foreseen through a vision in the Force.

===Fate of the Jedi===
Though Jacen makes few true appearances in the ''[[Fate of the Jedi]]'', which follows the ''Legacy of the Force'' series, his legacy is felt throughout the series, as Luke Skywalker is arrested for [[negligence of duty]] and is sentenced to a ten-year [[exile]], in which alongside his son Ben, he tries to ascertain the circumstances of how and why Jacen turned to the dark side.

Jacen's spirit makes its first appearance in ''[[Abyss (Star Wars novel)|Abyss]]'', wherein he warns Luke and Ben about [[List of Star Wars Legends characters#Abeloth|Abeloth]], the main antagonist of the series.

Then, in the final novel ''[[Apocalypse (Star Wars novel)|Apocalypse]]'', Jacen's spirit (along with Mara's) provides aid to Luke as he partners with [[Darth Krayt]] in the final battle against Abeloth. Following Abeloth's destruction, Jacen reveals that Krayt was the dark figure he saw in his vision of the future and the source of his downfall; he saw his daughter Allana standing next to Krayt. In response, Krayt insists that while Caedus's actions simply delayed the Sith, and they are eventually going to succeed in their planned takeover of the galaxy.

In aiding the Jedi against Abeloth, Jacen posthumously redeems himself; however, he still refers to his fate as [[damnation]]. While Luke does not forgive his nephew for his complicity in Mara's death, he does receive an understanding of what led Jacen to that point.

==Reception==
[[IGN]] listed Jacen as #17 on their list of the top 100 ''Star Wars'' heroes, saying that he had a more "profound effect" than any of the other Solo children on the ''Star Wars'' setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/star-wars-characters/17.html |title=Top 100 Star Wars Characters |work=IGN |accessdate=March 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817190212/http://www.ign.com/star-wars-characters/17.html |archivedate=August 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Schedeen, writing for IGN, also listed Darth Caedus as #5 in a reader-inspired list of top ''Star Wars'' villains, and called his "defining moment of villainy" his murder of [[Mara Jade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2008/04/25/top-star-wars-villains-fan-favorites |title=Top Star Wars Villains: Fan Favorites |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=April 25, 2008 |work=IGN |accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UGO.com]] listed Jacen as their top ''Star Wars'' expanded universe character, calling him "one of the most fearsome - and most tragic - villains in the ''Star Wars'' universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/star-wars-expanded-universe-characters-top-50-jacen-solo |title=Top 50 Star Wars Expanded Universe Characters |date=July 1, 2008 |work=UGO.com |accessdate=March 24, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FMFORIx6?url=http://www.ugo.com/games/star-wars-expanded-universe-characters-top-50-jacen-solo |archivedate=March 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4094">'''Jan Valentin Sæther''' (18 March 1944 – 11 January 2018) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Figurative art|figurative]] [[Painting|painter]], [[sculptor]] and [[gnosticism|gnostic]] priest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://religioner.no/jan-valentin-saether-dod/ Jan Valentin Sæther er død]; religioner.no, 12.1.2018&lt;/ref&gt; He was professor of figurative painting at the [[Oslo National Academy of the Arts|National Academy of the Arts]] in [[Oslo]] between 1996 and 2002.

Sæther received his education from the [[Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry]] (1963–65) and the [[Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts]], painting under the direction of professor [[Reidar Aulie]] (1965–66) and sculpture under professor [[Per Palle Storm]] (1968–71). He has presented numerous exhibitions, mainly in Norway and California.

Sæther debuted in the prestigious [[Kunstnerforbundet]] in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;Grøtvedt, Paul: "Jan Sæther i Kunstnerforbundet". ''Morgenbladet'', 6 October 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harr, Karl Erik: "Krystallklart sett". ''Dagbladet'', 3 October 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; but prior to that he had participated in group the exhibitions "Spring Exhibition", [[Kunstnernes Hus]] 1968, "Figurative painting from the 1960s", [[Oslo Kunstforening]] (''Oslo Arts Society'') 1970 and "Romantik, realisme", Oslo Kunstforening 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[[Øistein Parmann|Parmann, Øistein]]: "Kunstforeningen: Romantikk og realisme". ''Morgenbladet'', 21 October 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michelet, Johan Fredrik: "Romantikk og realisme i Kunstforeningen: Noen unge malere og de museale forbilder". ''VG'', 20 October 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he went by the name Jan Isak Sæther.

In 1973 he moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. In addition to his work as an artist he ran several art schools during his 22 years there.&lt;ref&gt;Berggren, Aud: "Kunstskole for uvanlige". ''VG'', 5 August 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korsvold, Kaja: "Norsk kunstner i californisk hete". ''Aftenposten'', morning edition, 19 September 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarto, Gro: "Norsk billedkunstner med kunstskole i Los Angeles". ''Morgenbladet'', 1 August 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Sæther moved back to Oslo in 1995. Between 1995 and 1996 he worked as [[amanuensis]] in charge of the models institute at the Oslo National Academy of the Arts. In 1996 he was contracted as professor of figurative painting there following a contentious and much publicized hiring process where the only competition that was to be considered qualified was his youth friend [[Odd Nerdrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Blom, Ina: "Akademi-saken ved veis ende". ''Aftenposten'', morning edition, 25 June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, Rustan: "Professor mot alle Odds". ''Billedkunstneren'', 7(96):12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the hiring of Sæther in the professorship connected to figurative painting and sculptor [[Istvan Lisztes]] in the professorship connected to figurative sculpture, the emotions calmed down.

== Gnostic congregation ==
Sæther became an ordained reverend of the gnostic church in December 1988 by the regional bishop [[Stephan A. Hoeller]] of [[Ecclesia Gnostica]] in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, A.W.: "Exile in Godville: Profile of a postmodern heretic", ''L.A.

Seidman's 2012 work is ''On Constitutional Disobedience'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.oup.com/academic/product/on-constitutional-disobedience-9780199898275?q=seidman&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us|title=On Constitutional Disobedience|work=oup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Seidman challenges the viability of political policy arguments made in reference to constitutional obligation.

==Education and early career==
Seidman received an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] from [[University of Chicago]] and a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1971.  After graduation, he clerked for D.C. Circuit Judge [[Skelly Wright]] and later clerked for Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]]. Following his clerkship, Seidman joined the [[Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fed-soc.org/experts/detail/louis-michael-seidman|title=Prof. Louis Michael Seidman|work=fed-soc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic work and influence==
Seidman is known for his contributions to constitutional legal theory, principally his theory of unsettlement put forward in his book ''Our Unsettled Constitution: A New Defense of Constitutionalism and Judicial Review'' (Yale 2001).&lt;ref name="yale.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300085310|title=Our Unsettled Constitution - Louis Michael Seidman|author=Yale University Press|work=yalepress.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from the [[critical legal studies]] [[Indeterminacy debate in legal theory|indeterminacy thesis]], Seidman argues that because constitutional law cannot settle fundamental political disputes, constitutional legal discourse and judicial review instead act to "unsettle" them.  Rather than resolving conflicts definitively, the temporary resolution of any controversy in constitutional law through [[judicial review]] leaves open the possibility that the losing side may make an equally plausible alternative constitutional argument.  In this way, both the prevailing and losing sides in a dispute recognize their positions as unstable and subject to revision within the recognized standards of legal argument.  As a result, both winners and losers have reasons to continue their debate within the framework of constitutional law, thereby keeping all parties at the table and consolidating the legal system.

Seidman's defense of judicial review provided a counterpoint within the critical legal studies school to his colleague and sometime collaborator [[Mark Tushnet]]'s attack on judicial review as undemocratic.

In addition to Seidman's theory of judicial review, he is also known for his constitutional law casebook, co-authored with [[Pamela Karlan]], Mark Tushnet, [[Geoffrey Stone]] and [[Cass Sunstein]].&lt;ref name="yale.edu"/&gt; Seidman is also noted for his work in criminal law and his book ''Silence and Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=11323|title=Silence and Freedom - Louis Michael Seidman|author=Stanford University Press|work=sup.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Sonia Sotomayor]] confirmation hearings, Seidman also attracted attention as an outspoken liberal detractor,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanprinciplesproject.org/blogs/a-supporter-defects.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; writing a scathing response to Sotomayor's claims that she simply applies the law to the facts (arguing that this is impossible to do).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/the-evasions-and-misstatements-of-sonia-sotomayor/|title=PJ Media|work=PJ Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Seidman was interviewed in the health care reform debate, defending the constitutionality of the single payer mandate against [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] criticism on [[fora tv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fora.tv/2009/10/26/Are_Healthcare_Purchase_Mandates_Constitutional|title=Are Healthcare Purchase Mandates Constitutional?|author=Georgetown University|work=FORA.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:LoveCoupon.png|frame|right|border|''Sample Love Coupon'']] --&gt;
A '''love coupon''' is a [[Romance (love)|romantic]] way of expressing one's feelings for a partner in a relationship. It is a form of voluntary [[IOU]] or [[promissory note]] between people in [[love]] that contains a promise from one of the partners in a relationship to engage in romantic activities at a time in the future.

The love coupon contains a relevant artistic image or drawing, a romantic promise and sometimes redeeming conditions like date of [[wikt:expiration|expiration]]. At the core a love coupon is a love note that uses the [[coupon]] [[metaphor]] but it can also be seen as a very specialized form of [[greeting card]].

The promise made through the love coupon can range from romantic fantasies to taking care of domestic chores. Samples of romantic promises may include an evening of dancing, night of kisses and cuddles, evening of romance, romantic weekend getaway, boat ride for two, BBQ party, stroll on the beach or a romantic day trip, just to name a few.

==Motivation==
Love coupons are seen as a romantic way to pamper one's lover or to reinforce and heat up a relationship. They are usually given as gifts on Valentine's Day, birthdays or anniversary days. They are meant to signify that one is deeply caring about his partner's wishes. A love coupon can be also seen as a sign of trust between partners. The receiver of the love coupon may choose to redeem it at a time of his choice providing no restrictions apply.&lt;ref name=complete&gt;{{citation |title= The Complete Idiot's Guide to Household Solutions |author= Melodie Moore |edition= illustrated |publisher= [[Alpha Books]] |page= 204 |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-02-862706-7 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=asNJEcPdIFgC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=%22love+coupons%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;cd=12#v=onepage&amp;q=%22love%20coupons%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is more effective to make a promise using a love coupon than to discuss and talk about it with your partner.

==Forms==
Love coupons can be found in many forms: as [[Greeting card|printed cards]], printed books of love coupons &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Godek | first = Gregory | authorlink = Gregory Godek | title = Love Coupons | publisher = [[Sourcebooks Casablanca]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-4022-0846-4 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and in digital format. Many web sites dedicated to subjects as [[Valentine's Day]], love and [[romance (love)|romance]] offer various forms of love coupons for download or as attachments for romantic [[Email|email messages]]. They can also be handmade from coloured paper, cut into [[heart]]-shape.&lt;ref name=complete /&gt;

Another popular variant uses the [[scratchcard]] metaphor. Created as [[Scratch-off|scratch-off lottery tickets]] they are sold and marketed as romantic gifts for lovers. Usually all tickets are winners, but like lottery cards one has to find the winning item or combination. The winnings range from romance, love and sex and the gift giver has to fulfill them.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Aside from love coupon, there are several other types of coupon that serve diverse purposes.

==Delivery==
Love coupons can be delivered individually or as books of coupons. They can be sent by traditional [[mail]], in digital format as [[email]] attachments, handed in person at the right moment or placed as surprises in places where the receiver will stumble upon them.

Love coupons can be bought in form of printed coupon books or can be downloaded and printed from various web sites. Some of these sites offer free customizable love coupons for download and print.&lt;ref name=slowform&gt;{{cite web |title= You can even make your own coupons out of magazines, photos, comics, or just write a note |publisher= U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url=http://www.family.samhsa.gov/activities/coupons_text.aspx  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827132449/http://www.family.samhsa.gov/activities/coupons_text.aspx |archivedate=2006-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational use==
A variant of the love coupon concept can be used by parents as an educational and relationship building tool. Parents can use this kind of coupon to get over communication barriers with their children and to assure the children of their love. Such a coupon can promise time for activities together, uninterrupted time for discussions or it can send a message hard to communicate in person.&lt;ref name=samhsa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://family.samhsa.gov/activities/coupons_text.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827132449/http://www.family.samhsa.gov/activities/coupons_text.aspx |archivedate=2006-08-27 |title=SAMHSA Family Guide: Activities. Encourage Communication... With Coupons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as promotional material==
Various companies started to use love coupons as promotional materials for their products and brands. For example, [[Jones Soda]] Co. introduced in 2006 a Valentines Pack containing among others a book of "Love Coupons".

{{Philosophy sidebar}}

'''Metaphysics''' is the branch of philosophy that examines the fundamental nature of reality, including the relationship between [[mind]] and [[matter]], between [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[Property (philosophy)|attribute]], and between [[Potentiality and actuality|possibility and actuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|dictionary=American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language|edition=5th|year=2011|title=metaphysics|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/metaphysics|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "metaphysics" comes from two Greek words that, together, literally mean "after or behind or among the [study of] the natural". It has been suggested that the term might have been coined by a first century CE editor who assembled various small selections of [[Aristotle]]’s works into the treatise we now know by the name [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']] (''ta meta ta phusika'', 'after the [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']]&amp;thinsp;', another of Aristotle's works).&lt;ref name="Stanford.Enc.Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cohen |first1=S. Marc |title=Aristotle's Metaphysics |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab Center for the Study of Language and Information Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305-4115 |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphysics studies questions related to what it is for something to exist and what types of existence there are. Metaphysics seeks to answer, in an abstract and fully general manner, the questions:&lt;ref&gt;What is it (that is, whatever it is that there is) like? {{cite encyclopedia |last=Hall |first=Ned |editor=Edward N. Zalta |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=David Lewis's Metaphysics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2012/entries/lewis-metaphysics/ |accessdate=October 5, 2012 |edition=Fall 2012 |year=2012 |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# What {{em|is there}}?
# What is it {{em|like}}?

Topics of metaphysical investigation include [[existence]], [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and their [[Property (philosophy)|properties]], [[space]] and [[time]], [[Causality|cause and effect]], and [[Subjunctive possibility|possibility]].

==Epistemological foundation==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Like mathematics, metaphysics is a non-empirical study which is conducted using deduction from that which is known ''a priori''.  Like foundational mathematics (which is sometimes considered a special case of metaphysics applied to the existence of number), it tries to give a coherent account of the structure of the world, capable of explaining our everyday and scientific perception of the world, and being free from contradictions.  In mathematics, there are many different ways to define numbers; similarly in metaphysics there are many different ways to define objects, properties, concepts, and other entities which are claimed to make up the world.   While metaphysics may, as a special case, study the entities postulated by fundamental science such as atoms and superstrings, its core topic is the set of categories such as object, property and causality which those scientific theories assume.   For example: claiming that "electrons have charge" is a scientific theory; while exploring what it means for electrons to be (or at least, to be perceived as)  "objects", charge to be a "property", and for both to exist in a topological entity called "space" is the task of metaphysics.

There are two broad stances about what is "the world" studied by metaphysics. The strong, classical view assumes that the objects studied by metaphysics exist independently of any observer, so that the subject is the most fundamental of all sciences. The weak, modern view assumes that the objects studied by metaphysics exist inside the mind of an observer, so the subject becomes a form of [[introspection]] and [[conceptual analysis]]. Some philosophers, notably [[Kant]], discuss both of these "worlds" and what can be inferred about each one.  Some philosophers, such as the [[logical positivists]], and many scientists, reject the strong view of metaphysics as meaningless and unverifiable. Others reply that this criticism also applies to any type of knowledge, including hard science, which claims to describe anything other than the contents of human perception, and thus that the world of perception ''is'' the objective world in some sense.  Metaphysics itself usually assumes that some stance has been taken on these questions and that it may proceed independently of the choice—the question of which stance to take belongs instead to another branch of philosophy, [[epistemology]].

==Central questions==
===Ontology (Being)===
{{See also|Ontology}}
Ontology is the [[philosophical]] [[wikt:study|study]] of the nature of [[being]], [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], [[existence]] or [[reality]], as well as the basic [[category of being|categories of being]] and their relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ontology&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally listed as the core of metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what [[entities]] exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a [[hierarchy]], and subdivided according to similarities and differences.

===Identity and change===
{{See also|Identity (philosophy)|Philosophy of space and time}}

Identity is a fundamental metaphysical issue. Metaphysicians investigating identity are tasked with the question of what, exactly, it means for something to be identical to itself, or — more controversially — to something else. Issues of identity arise in the context of time: what does it mean for something to be itself across two moments in time? How do we account for this? Another question of identity arises when we ask what our criteria ought to be for determining identity? And how does the reality of identity interface with linguistic expressions?

The metaphysical positions one takes on identity have far-reaching implications on issues such as the mind-body problem, personal identity, ethics, and law.

The ancient Greeks took extreme positions on the nature of change. [[Parmenides]] denied change altogether, while [[Heraclitus]] argued that change was ubiquitous: "[Y]ou cannot step into the same river twice."

Identity, sometimes called [[Numerical identity|Numerical Identity]], is the relation that a "thing" bears to itself, and which no "thing" bears to anything other than itself (cf. [[sameness]]).

A modern philosopher who made a lasting impact on the philosophy of identity was [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], whose ''Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals'' is still in wide use today. It states that if some object '''''x''''' is identical to some object '''''y''''', then any property that '''''x''''' has, '''''y''''' will have as well.

Put formally, it states
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \; \forall y \; (x = y \rightarrow \forall P \; (P(x) \leftrightarrow P(y)))&lt;/math&gt;

However, it seems, too, that objects can change over time. If one were to look at a tree one day, and the tree later lost a leaf, it would seem that one could still be looking at that same tree. Two rival theories to account for the relationship between change and identity are [[perdurantism]], which treats the tree as a series of tree-stages, and [[endurantism]], which maintains that the organism—the same tree—is present at every stage in its history.

===Space and time===
{{See also|Philosophy of space and time}}
Objects appear to us in space and time, while abstract entities such as classes, properties, and relations do not.  What then is meant by space and time such that it can serve this function as a ground for objects?  Are space and time entities themselves, of some form, or must they exist prior to other entities?  How exactly can they be defined?  For example, if time is defined as a "rate of change" then must there always be something changing in order for time to exist?

===Causality===
{{See also|Causality}}
Classical philosophy recognized a number of causes, including [[teleological]] future causes. In [[special relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]] the notions of space, time and causality become tangled together, with temporal orders of causations becoming dependent on who is observing them. The laws of physics are symmetrical in time, so could equally well be used to describe time as running backwards. Why then do we perceive it as flowing in one direction, the [[arrow of time]], and as containing causation flowing in the same direction?

Causality is linked by most philosophers to the concept of [[counterfactuals]]. To say that A caused B means that if A had not happened then B would not have happened.

Causality is usually required as a foundation for [[philosophy of science]], if science aims to understand causes and effects and make predictions about them.

===Necessity and possibility===
{{See also|Modal logic|Modal realism}}
Metaphysicians investigate questions about the ways the world could have been. [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], in ''[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]'', endorsed a view called Concrete [[Modal realism]], according to which facts about how things could have been are made true by other [[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] worlds, just as in ours, in which things are different. Other philosophers, such as [[Gottfried Leibniz]], have dealt with the idea of possible worlds as well. The idea of necessity is that any necessary fact is true across all [[possible world]]s. A possible fact is true in some possible world, even if not in the actual world. For example, it is possible that cats could have had two tails, or that any particular [[Apple (symbolism)|apple]] could have not existed. By contrast, certain propositions seem necessarily true, such as [[analytic proposition]]s, e.g., "All bachelors are unmarried." The particular example of [[Logical truth|analytic truth]] being necessary is not universally held among philosophers. A less controversial view might be that self-identity is necessary, as it seems fundamentally incoherent to claim that for any '''''x''''', it is not identical to itself; this is known as the ''law of identity'', a putative "first principle". Aristotle describes the ''principle of non-contradiction'', "It is impossible that the same quality should both belong and not belong to the same thing&amp;nbsp;... This is the most certain of all principles&amp;nbsp;... Wherefore they who demonstrate refer to this as an ultimate opinion. For it is by nature the source of all the other axioms."

==Peripheral questions==
What is "central" and "peripheral" to metaphysics has varied over time and schools; however contemporary analytic philosophy as taught in USA and UK universities generally regards the above as "central" and the following as "applications" or "peripheral" topics; or in some cases as distinct subjects which have grown out of and depend upon metaphysics:

===Cosmology and cosmogony===
{{See also|Cosmology (metaphysics)}}
[[Cosmology#Metaphysical cosmology|Metaphysical cosmology]] is the branch of metaphysics that deals with the [[world]] as the totality of all [[phenomena]] in [[space]] and [[time]]. Historically, it formed a major part of the subject alongside Ontology, though its role is more peripheral in contemporary philosophy. It has had a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion. The ancient Greeks drew no distinction between this use and their model for the cosmos. However, in modern times it addresses questions about the [[Universe]] which are beyond the scope of the physical sciences. It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods (e.g. [[dialectic]]s).

[[Cosmogony]] deals specifically with the origin of the universe.  Modern metaphysical cosmology and cosmogony try to address questions such as:
* What is the origin of the Universe? What is its first cause? Is its existence necessary? (see [[monism]], [[pantheism]], [[emanationism]] and [[creationism]])
* What are the ultimate material components of the Universe? (see [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[Dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], [[hylomorphism]], [[atomism]])
* What is the ultimate reason for the existence of the Universe? Does the cosmos have a purpose? (see [[teleology]])

===Mind and matter===
{{See also|Philosophy of mind}}
[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|right|350px|Different approaches toward resolving the mind–body problem]]

Accounting for the existence of [[mind]] in a world otherwise composed of [[matter]] is a metaphysical problem which is so large and important as to have become a specialized subject of study in its own right, [[philosophy of mind]].

[[Substance dualism]] is a classical theory in which mind and body are essentially different, with the mind having some of the attributes traditionally assigned to the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and which creates an immediate conceptual puzzle about how the two interact.    [[Idealism]] postulates that material objects do not exist unless perceived and only as perceptions.  [[Panpsychism]] and [[panexperientialism]], are [[property dualist]] theories in which everything ''has'' or ''is'' a mind rather than everything exists ''in'' a mind.  [[Neutral monism]] postulates that existence consists of a single substance that in itself is neither mental nor physical, but is capable of mental and physical aspects or attributes{{spaced ndash}}thus it implies a [[dual-aspect theory]].   For the last century, the dominant theories have been science-inspired including [[materialism|materialistic monism]], [[identity theory of mind|Type identity theory]], [[token identity|token identity theory]], [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], [[reductive physicalism]], [[nonreductive physicalism]], [[eliminative materialism]], [[anomalous monism]], [[property dualism]], [[epiphenomenalism]] and [[emergence]].

===Determinism and free will===
{{See also|Determinism|Free will}}
[[Determinism]] is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[proposition]] that every event, including human cognition, decision and action, is [[causality|causally]] determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences. It holds that nothing happens that has not already been determined. The principal consequence of the deterministic claim is that it poses a challenge to the existence of [[free will]].

The problem of [[free will]] is the problem of whether rational agents exercise control over their own actions and decisions. Addressing this problem requires understanding the relation between freedom and causation, and determining whether the laws of nature are causally deterministic. Some philosophers, known as [[Incompatibilism|Incompatibilists]], view determinism and free will as [[mutually exclusive]]. If they believe in determinism, they will therefore believe free will to be an illusion, a position known as ''Hard Determinism''. Proponents range from [[Baruch Spinoza]] to [[Ted Honderich]].

Others, labeled [[Compatibilism|Compatibilists]] (or "Soft Determinists"), believe that the two ideas can be reconciled coherently. Adherents of this view include [[Thomas Hobbes]] and many modern philosophers such as [[John Martin Fischer]].

Incompatibilists who accept [[free will]] but reject determinism are called [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarians]], a term not to be confused with the political sense. [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]] and [[Alvin Plantinga]] are modern defenders of this theory.

===Natural and social kinds===
The earliest type of classification of social construction traces back to [[Plato]] in his dialogue [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]] where he claims that the biological classification system seems to "carve nature at the joints".&lt;ref&gt;http://sfbay-anarchists.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Plato-Phaedrus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, later philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] have challenged the capacity of natural and social classification. In his essay [[The Analytical Language of John Wilkins]], Borges makes us imagine a certain encyclopedia where the animals are divided into (a) those that belong to the emperor; (b) embalmed ones; (c) those that are trained;... and so forth, in order to bring forward the ambiguity of natural and social kinds.&lt;ref&gt;https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/155/assignment/ex1/Borges.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to metaphysics author Alyssa Ney: "the reason all this is interesting is that there seems to be a metaphysical difference between the Borgesian system and Platos".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.routledge.com/Metaphysics-An-Introduction/Ney/p/book/9780415640756&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is not obvious but one classification attempts to carve entities up according to objective distinction while the other does not. According to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] this notion is closely related to the notion of similarity.&lt;ref&gt;http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number===
{{main|Philosophy of mathematics}}
There are different ways to set up the notion of number in metaphysics theories.  [[Platonist]] theories postulate number as a fundamental category itself.  Others consider it to be a property of an entity called a "group" comprising other entities; or to be a relation held between several groups of entities, such as "the number four is the set of all sets of four things".  Many of the debates around [[universals]] are applied to the study of number, and are of particular importance due to its status as a foundation for the [[philosophy of mathematics]] and for [[mathematics]] itself.

===Applied metaphysics===
Although metaphysics as a philosophical enterprise is highly hypothetical, it also has practical application in most other branches of philosophy, science, and now also information technology. Such areas generally assume some basic ontology (such as a system of objects, properties, classes, and spacetime) as well as other metaphysical stances on topics such as causality and agency, then build their own particular theories upon these.

In [[science]], for example, some theories are based on the ontological assumption of objects with properties (such as electrons having charge) while others may reject objects completely (such as quantum field theories, where spread-out "electronness" becomes a property of spacetime rather than an object).

"Social" branches of philosophy such as [[philosophy of morality]], [[aesthetics]] and [[philosophy of religion]] (which in turn give rise to practical subjects such as ethics, politics, law, and art) all require metaphysical foundations, which may be considered as branches or applications of metaphysics.  For example, they may postulate the existence of basic entities such as value, beauty, and God.   Then they use these postulates to make their own arguments about consequences resulting from them.  When philosophers in these subjects make their foundations they are doing applied metaphysics, and may draw upon its core topics and methods to guide them, including ontology and other core and peripheral topics.  As in science, the foundations chosen will in turn depend on the underlying ontology used, so philosophers in these subjects may have to dig right down to the ontological layer of metaphysics to find what is possible for their theories.  For example, a contradiction obtained in a theory of God or Beauty might be due to an assumption that it is an object rather than some other kind of ontological entity.

==Relationship of metaphysics and science==

Prior to the modern [[history of science]], scientific questions were addressed as a part of [[natural philosophy]]. Originally, the term "science" ([[Latin]] ''scientia'') simply meant "knowledge". The [[scientific method]], however, transformed natural philosophy into an [[empirical]] activity deriving from [[experiment]], unlike the rest of philosophy. By the end of the 18th century, it had begun to be called "science" to distinguish it from philosophy. Thereafter, metaphysics denoted philosophical enquiry of a non-empirical character into the nature of existence.&lt;ref name="Peter Gay pp. 132-141"&gt;Peter Gay, ''The Enlightenment'', vol. 1 (''The Rise of Modern Paganism''), Chapter 3, Section II, pp. 132–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphysics continues asking "why" where science leaves off. For example, any theory of fundamental physics is based on some set of [[axiom]]s, which may postulate the existence of entities such as atoms, particles, forces, charges, mass, or fields. Stating such postulates is considered to be the "end" of a science theory. Metaphysics takes these postulates and explores what they mean as human concepts. For example, do all theories of physics require the existence of space and time,&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Sydney. "Time without change." The Journal of Philosophy 66.12 (1969): 363-381.&lt;/ref&gt; objects, and properties? Or can they be expressed using only objects, or only properties? Do the objects have to retain their identity over time or do they change?&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-idind/ Identity and Individuality in Quantum Theory, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; If they change, then are they still the same object? Can theories be reformulated by converting properties or predicates (such as "red") into entities (such as redness or redness fields) or processes ('there is some redding happening over there' appears in some human languages in place of the use of properties). Is the distinction between objects and properties fundamental to the physical world or to our perception of it?

Much recent work has been devoted to analyzing the role of metaphysics in scientific theorizing. [[Alexandre Koyré]] led this movement, declaring in his book ''Metaphysics and Measurement'', "It is not by following experiment, but by outstripping experiment, that the scientific mind makes progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Metaphysics and Measurement |last=Koyré |first=Alexandre |year=1968 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; That metaphysical propositions can influence scientific theorizing is [[John W. N. Watkins|John Watkins]]' most lasting contribution to philosophy. Since 1957&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=J. W. N. Watkins |title=Epistemology and Politics |journal=[[Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society]] |date=9 December 1957 |volume=58 |issue= |pages=79–102 |doi=10.1007/978-94-009-3491-7_10 |jstor=4544590|series=Nijhoff International Philosophy Series |isbn=978-90-247-3455-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.

Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-07826-1}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

An example from biology of Lakatos' thesis: [[David Hull]] has argued that changes in the ontological status of the species concept have been central in the development of biological thought from [[Aristotle]] through [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]], and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]. Darwin's ignorance of metaphysics made it more difficult for him to respond to his critics because he could not readily grasp the ways in which their underlying metaphysical views differed from his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hull |first1=David |year=1967 |authorlink=David Hull|title=The Metaphysics of Evolution |journal=British Journal for the History of Science |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=309–337 |doi=10.1017/s0007087400002892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In physics, new metaphysical ideas have arisen in connection with [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], where subatomic particles arguably do not have the same sort of individuality as the particulars with which philosophy has traditionally been concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arenhart |first1=Jonas R. B. |year=2012 |title=Ontological frameworks for scientific theories |journal=Foundations of Science |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=339–356 |doi=10.1007/s10699-012-9288-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, adherence to a deterministic metaphysics in the face of the challenge posed by the quantum-mechanical [[uncertainty principle]] led physicists such as Albert Einstein to propose [[Hidden variable theory|alternative theories]] that retained determinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html |title=Does God play dice? |author=[[Stephen Hawking|Hawking, Stephen]] |year=1999 |accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred North Whitehead|A. N. Whitehead]] is famous for creating a [[process philosophy]] metaphysics inspired by electromagnetism and special relativity.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ronny Desmet and Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Éditions Chromatika, 2010 ({{ISBN|978-2-930517-08-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, [[Gilbert Newton Lewis]] addressed the nature of motion, arguing that an electron should not be said to move when it has none of the properties of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodebush |first1=Worth H. |year=1929 |title=The electron theory of valence |journal=Chemical Reviews |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=509–531 | doi=10.1021/cr60020a007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katherine Hawley notes that the metaphysics even of a widely accepted scientific theory may be challenged if it can be argued that the metaphysical presuppositions of the theory make no contribution to its predictive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hawley |first1=Katherine |year=2006| title=Science as a Guide to Metaphysics? |journal=Synthese |volume=149 |issue=3 |pages=451–470 |issn=0039-7857 |doi=10.1007/s11229-005-0569-1 |url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~kjh5/OnlinePapers/ScienceAsAGuideToMetaphysics.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.201.3843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rejections of metaphysics==
A number of individuals have suggested that much or all of metaphysics should be rejected. In the 16th century, [[Francis Bacon]] rejected [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] metaphysics, and argued strongly for what is now called [[empiricism]], being seen later as the father of modern empirical science. In the eighteenth century, David Hume took a strong position, arguing that all genuine knowledge involves either mathematics or matters of fact and that metaphysics, which goes beyond these, is worthless. He concludes his ''[[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'' with the statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, ''Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?'' No. ''Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?'' No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/david_hume/human_understanding.html |title=An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding |author=Hume, David |authorlink=David Hume |year=1748 |at=§132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thirty-three years after Hume's ''Enquiry'' appeared, Immanuel Kant published his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Although he followed Hume in rejecting much of previous metaphysics, he argued that there was still room for some ''[[Analytic–synthetic distinction|synthetic a priori]]'' knowledge, concerned with matters of fact yet obtainable independent of experience. These included fundamental structures of space, time, and causality. He also argued for the freedom of the will and the existence of "things in themselves", the ultimate (but unknowable) objects of experience.

Wittgenstein introduced the concept that metaphysics could be influenced by theories of aesthetics, via [[logic]], vis. a world composed of "atomical facts".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5740 |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|author=Wittgenstein, Ludwig |authorlink=Ludwig Wittgenstein |year=1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus". Major Works: ''Selected Philosophical Writings''. Harper Perennial Modern Classics, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, [[A. J. Ayer]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] endorsed Hume's position; Carnap quoted the passage above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://philosophy.ru/edu/ref/sci/carnap.html |title=Philosophy and Logical Syntax |author=Carnap, Rudolf |authorlink=Rudolf Carnap |date=1935 |chapter=The Rejection of Metaphysics |accessdate=September 2, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114004813/http://philosophy.ru/edu/ref/sci/carnap.html|archivedate=14 January 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that metaphysical statements are neither true nor false but meaningless since, according to their [[Verificationism|verifiability theory of meaning]], a statement is meaningful only if there can be empirical evidence for or against it. Thus, while Ayer rejected the monism of Spinoza, he avoided a commitment to [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]], the contrary position, by holding both views to be without meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Language, Truth and Logic |last=Ayer |first=A. J. |authorlink=A. J. Ayer|year=1936 |publisher=Victor Gollantz |url=https://archive.org/details/AlfredAyer |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap took a similar line with the controversy over the reality of the external world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Der Logische Aufbau der Welt |last=Carnap |first=Rudolf |authorlink=Rudolf Carnap |others=Trans. 1967 by Rolf A. George as ''The Logical Structure of the World'' |year=1928 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-01417-6 |pages=333f}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the logical positivism movement is now considered dead, (with a major proponent [[AJ Ayer]] admitting in a TV interview that "it was a lot of fun ... but it was false") it has continued to influence philosophy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanfling|first=Oswald|chapter=Logical Positivism|title=Routledge History of Philosophy|volume=IX|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing against such rejections, the Scholastic philosopher [[Edward Feser]] has observed that Hume's critique of metaphysics, and specifically [[Hume's fork]], is "notoriously self-refuting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Scholastic Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction |last=Feser |first=Edward |year=2014 |isbn=978-3-86838-544-1 |page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feser argues that Hume's fork itself is not a conceptual truth and is not empirically testable.

Some living philosophers, such as [[Amie Thomasson]], have argued that many metaphysical questions can be dissolved just by looking at the way we use words; others, such as [[Ted Sider]], have argued that metaphysical questions are substantive, and that we can make progress toward answering them by comparing theories according to a range of theoretical virtues inspired by the sciences, such as simplicity and explanatory power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chalmers|first1=David|last2=Manley|first2=David|last3=Wasserman|first3=Ryan|title=Metametaphysics|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "metaphysics" derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words [[wikt:μετά|μετά]] (''[[Meta|metá]]'',"after") and [[wikt:φυσικά|φυσικά]] (''physiká'', "physics").&lt;ref&gt;In the English language, the word comes by way of the [[Medieval Latin]] ''metaphysica'', the neuter plural of [[Medieval Greek]] ''metaphysika''.[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=metaphysics] Various dictionaries trace its first appearance in English to the mid-sixteenth century, although in some cases as early as 1387.[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=me]&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used as the title for several of [[Aristotle]]'s works, because they were usually anthologized after the works on [[physics (Aristotle)|physics]] in complete editions. The prefix ''meta-'' ("after") indicates that these works come "after" the chapters on physics. However, Aristotle himself did not call the subject of these books metaphysics: he referred to it as "first philosophy." The editor of Aristotle's works, [[Andronicus of Rhodes]], is thought to have placed the books on first philosophy right after another work, ''Physics'', and called them {{lang|grc|τὰ μετὰ τὰ φυσικὰ βιβλία}} (''tà metà tà physikà biblía'') or "the books [that come] after the [books on] physics". 

However, once the name was given, the commentators sought to find other reasons for its appropriateness. For instance, [[Thomas Aquinas]] understood it to refer to the chronological or pedagogical order among our philosophical studies, so that the "metaphysical sciences" would mean "those that we study after having mastered the sciences that deal with the physical world". &lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Expositio in librum Boethii De hebdomadibus'', V, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was misread by other medieval commentators, who thought it meant "the science of what is beyond the physical".{{cn|date=November 2018}}  Following this tradition, the prefix ''meta-'' has more recently been prefixed to the names of sciences to designate higher sciences dealing with ulterior and more fundamental problems: hence [[metamathematics]], [[Wikt:metaphysiology|metaphysiology]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|dictionary=The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary|volume=vol. 1 (A–O)|title=meta-|year=1971|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who creates or develops metaphysical theories is called a ''metaphysician''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/metaphysician Random House Dictionary Online]''{{spaced ndash}}''metaphysician''&lt;/ref&gt;

Common parlance also uses the word "metaphysics" for a different referent from that of the present article, namely for beliefs in arbitrary non-physical or [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] entities. For example, "Metaphysical healing" to refer to healing by means of remedies that are magical rather than scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Metaphysics}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This usage stemmed from the various historical schools of speculative metaphysics which operated by postulating all manner of physical, mental and spiritual entities as bases for particular metaphysical systems. Metaphysics as a subject does not preclude beliefs in such magical entities but neither does it promote them. Rather, it is the subject which provides the vocabulary and logic with which such beliefs might be analyzed and studied, for example to search for inconsistencies both within themselves and with other accepted systems such as [[Science]].

==History and schools of metaphysics==
===Pre-history===
[[Cognitive archeology]] such as analysis of cave paintings and other pre-historic art and customs suggests that a form of [[perennial philosophy]] or [[Shamanism]] metaphysics may stretch back to the birth of [[behavioral modernity]], all around the world.   Similar beliefs are found in present-day "stone age" cultures such as Australian [[Aboriginal Australians|aboriginals]].  Perennial philosophy postulates the existence of a spirit or concept world alongside the day-to-day world, and interactions between these worlds during dreaming and ritual, or on special days or at special places.  It has been argued that perennial philosophy formed the basis for [[Platonism]], with Plato articulating, rather than creating, much older widespread beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis-Williams. "Inside the Neolithic Mind: Consciousness, Cosmos, and the Realm of the Gods."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Huxley "The perennial philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronze age===
Bronze Age cultures such as [[ancient Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]] (along with similarly structured but chronologically later cultures such as [[Mayans]] and [[Aztecs]]) developed belief systems based on [[mythology]], anthropomorphic [[gods]], [[mind-body dualism]], and a [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]], to explain causes and cosmology.  These cultures appear to have been interested in [[astronomy]] and may have associated or identified the stars with some of these entities.  In ancient Egypt, the ontological distinction between order ([[maat]]) and [[chaos (mythology)|chaos]] ([[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|Isfet]]) seems to have been important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Geraldine Pinch| last = Pinch | first = Geraldine | title = Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of ancient Egypt | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-19-517024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Socratic Greece===
[[File:Monad.svg|thumb|right|The circled dot was used by the Pythagoreans and later Greeks to represent the first metaphysical being, the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] or [[The Absolute]].]]
The first named Greek philosopher, according to [[Aristotle]], is [[Thales]] of [[Miletus]], early 6th century BCE. He made use of purely physical explanations to explain the phenomena of the world rather than the mythological and divine explanations of tradition.  He is thought to have posited water as the single underlying principle  (or ''[[Arche]] in later Aristotelian terminology) of the material world''.  His fellow, but younger Miletians,  [[Anaximander]] and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], also posited monistic underlying principles, namely apeiron (the indefinite or boundless) and air respectively.

Another school was the [[Eleatics]], in southern [[Italy]]. The group was founded in the early fifth century BCE by [[Parmenides]], and included [[Zeno of Elea]] and [[Melissus of Samos]]. Methodologically, the Eleatics were broadly rationalist, and took logical standards of clarity and necessity to be the criteria of [[truth]]. Parmenides' chief doctrine was that reality is a single unchanging and universal Being. Zeno used ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', to demonstrate the illusory nature of change and time in his [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]].

[[Heraclitus]] of [[Ephesus]], in contrast, made change central, teaching that "all things flow". His philosophy, expressed in brief aphorisms, is quite cryptic. For instance, he also taught the [[unity of opposites]].

[[Democritus]] and his teacher [[Leucippus]], are known for formulating an [[atomic theory]] for the cosmos.&lt;ref name="Barnes87"&gt;[[#Barnes|Barnes]] (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered forerunners of the scientific method.

===Classical China===
[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|right|230px|The modern "yin and yang symbol" (''[[taijitu]]'')]]
Metaphysics in [[Chinese philosophy]] can be traced back to the earliest Chinese philosophical concepts from the [[Zhou Dynasty]] such as [[Tian]] (Heaven) and [[Yin and Yang]]. The fourth century BCE saw a turn towards [[cosmogony]] with the rise of [[Taoism]] (in the [[Daodejing]] and [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]) and sees the natural world as dynamic and constantly changing processes which spontaneously arise from a single immanent metaphysical source or principle ([[Tao]]).&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Perkins, Franklin, "Metaphysics in Chinese Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/chinese-metaphysics/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Another philosophical school which arose around this time was the [[School of Naturalists]] which saw the ultimate metaphysical principle as the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]], the "supreme polarity" composed of the forces of [[Ying and Yang]] which were always in a state of change seeking balance. Another concern of Chinese metaphysics, especially Taoism, is the relationship and nature of Being and non-Being (you 有 and wu 無). The Taoists held that the ultimate, the Tao, was also non-being or no-presence.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Other important concepts were those of spontaneous generation or natural vitality ([[Ziran]]) and "correlative resonance" ([[Ganying]]).

After the fall of the Han Dynasty (220 CE), China saw the rise of the Neo-Taoist [[Xuanxue]] school. This school was very influential in developing the concepts of later Chinese metaphysics.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; [[Buddhist philosophy]] entered China (c 1st century) and was influenced by the native Chinese metaphysical concepts to develop new theories. The native [[Tiantai]] and [[Huayen]] schools of philosophy maintained and reinterpreted the Indian theories of [[shunyata]] (emptiness, kong 空) and [[Buddha-nature]] (Fo xing 佛性) into the theory of [[Huayan#Interpenetration|interpenetration]] of phenomena. [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucians]] like [[Zhang Zai]] under the influence of other schools developed the concepts of "principle" ([[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]]) and vital energy ([[qi]]).

===Socrates and Plato===
[[Socrates]] is known for his [[dialectic]] or questioning approach to philosophy rather than a positive metaphysical doctrine.

His pupil, [[Plato]] is famous for his theory of [[Platonic forms|forms]] (which he places in the mouth of Socrates in his dialogues). [[Platonic realism]] (also considered a form of idealism)&lt;ref&gt;As universals were considered by Plato to be [[Theory of Forms|ideal forms]], this stance is confusingly also called [[Platonic idealism]]. This should not be confused with [[Philosophical idealism|Idealism]], as presented by philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant]]: as Platonic [[abstraction]]s are not spatial, temporal, or mental they are not compatible with the later Idealism's emphasis on mental existence.&lt;/ref&gt; is considered to be a solution to the [[problem of universals]]; i.e., what particular objects have in common is that they share a specific Form which is universal to all others of their respective kind.

The theory has a number of other aspects:
* Epistemological: knowledge of the Forms is more certain than mere sensory data.
* Ethical: The Form of the Good sets an objective standard for morality.
* Time and Change: The world of the Forms is eternal and unchanging. Time and change belong only to the lower sensory world. "Time is a moving image of Eternity".
* Abstract objects and mathematics: Numbers, geometrical figures, etc., exist mind-independently in the World of Forms.

Platonism developed into [[Neoplatonism]], a philosophy with a monotheistic and mystical flavour that survived well into the early Christian era.

===Aristotle===
Plato's pupil [[Aristotle]] wrote widely on almost every subject, including [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|metaphysics]]. His solution to the problem of universals contrasts with Plato's. Whereas Platonic Forms are existentially apparent in the visible world, Aristotelian [[essence]]s dwell in particulars.

[[Potentiality and Actuality]]&lt;ref&gt;The words "potentiality" and "actuality" are one set of translations from the
original Greek terms of Aristotle. Other translations (including Latin) and alternative Greek terms are sometimes used in scholarly work on the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; are principles of a [[dichotomy]] which [[Aristotle]] used throughout his philosophical works to analyze [[motion (physics)|motion]], [[four causes|causality]] and other issues.

The Aristotelian theory of change and causality stretches to [[four causes]]: the material, formal, efficient and final. The efficient cause corresponds to what is now known as a cause ''simpliciter''. Final causes are explicitly [[teleological]], a concept now regarded as controversial in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Thomas-Nagel-Went-Wrong/139129|title=Where Thomas Nagel Went Wrong|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Matter/Form dichotomy was to become highly influential in later philosophy as the substance/essence distinction.

The opening arguments in Aristotle's ''Metaphysics'', Book I,  revolve around the senses, knowledge, experience, theory, and wisdom.  The first main focus in the Metaphysics is attempting to determine how intellect "advances from sensation through memory, experience, and art, to theoretical knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;McKeon, R. (1941). Metaphysics. In The Basic Works of Aristotle (p. 682). New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle claims that eyesight provides us with the capability to recognize and remember experiences, while sound allows us to learn.

''Sāṃkhya'' is an ancient system of Indian philosophy based on a dualism involving the ultimate principles of consciousness and matter.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Samkhya", Webster's College Dictionary (2010), Random House, {{ISBN|978-0-375-40741-3}}, Quote: "Samkhya is a system of Hindu philosophy stressing the reality and duality of spirit and matter."&lt;/ref&gt; It is described as the [[rationalism|rationalist]] school of [[Indian philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-64887-5}}, pages&amp;nbsp;43–46&lt;/ref&gt; It is most related to the [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school of [[Hinduism]], and its method was most influential on the development of [[Early Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=royper&gt;Roy Perrett, Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges, Volume 1 (Editor: P Bilimoria et al.), Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3301-3}}, pages&amp;nbsp;149–158&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sāmkhya is an enumerationist philosophy whose [[epistemology]] accepts three of six [[pramana]]s (proofs) as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge. These include ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference) and ''śabda'' (''āptavacana'', word/testimony of reliable sources).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Larson |first = Gerald James |title = Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning |publisher = Motilal Banarasidass |year = 1998 |location = London |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ih2aGLp4d1gC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn = 978-81-208-0503-3 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag&gt;

[[Jiva]] (a living being) is that state in which puruṣa is bonded to prakṛti in some form.&lt;ref name=sambri/&gt; This fusion, state the Samkhya scholars, led to the emergence of ''buddhi'' ("spiritual awareness") and ''ahaṅkāra'' (ego consciousness). The universe is described by this school as one created by purusa-prakṛti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind.&lt;ref name=sambri&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/520526/Samkhya Samkhya - Hinduism] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; During the state of imbalance, one of more constituents overwhelm the others, creating a form of bondage, particularly of the mind. The end of this imbalance, bondage is called liberation, or [[moksha]], by the Samkhya school.&lt;ref name="Gerald James Larson 2011 pages 36-47"&gt;Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0503-3}}, pages&amp;nbsp;36–47&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of God or supreme being is not directly asserted, nor considered relevant by the Samkhya philosophers.

Samkhya is known for its theory of [[guṇa]]s (qualities, innate tendencies).&lt;ref&gt;Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0503-3}}, pages&amp;nbsp;154–206&lt;/ref&gt; Guṇa, it states, are of three types: ''sattva'' being good, compassionate, illuminating, positive, and constructive; ''rajas'' is one of activity, chaotic, passion, impulsive, potentially good or bad; and ''tamas'' being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destructive, lethargic, negative. Everything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these three guṇas, but in different proportions. The interplay of these guṇas defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life.&lt;ref name=jamesg&gt;James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3179-8}}, page 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T Bernard (1999), ''Hindu Philosophy'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1373-1}}, pages 74–76&lt;/ref&gt; The Samkhya theory of guṇas was widely discussed, developed and refined by various schools of Indian philosophies, including Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Wayman (1962), Buddhist Dependent Origination and the Samkhya gunas, Ethnos, Volume 27, Issue 1-4, pages&amp;nbsp;14–22, {{doi|10.1080/00141844.1962.9980914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samkhya's philosophical treatises also influenced the development of various theories of Hindu ethics.&lt;ref name=royper/&gt;

====Vedānta====
Realization of the nature of Self-identity is the principal object of the Vedanta system of Indian metaphysics. In the [[Upanishad]]s, self-consciousness is not the first-person indexical self-awareness or the self-awareness which is self-reference without identification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Self-Reference and Self-awareness|author=Andrew Brook|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Co.|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=h6XG5Dg7dUUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Self-consciousness#v=onepage&amp;q=Self-consciousness&amp;f=false|isbn=978-9027251503|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also not the self-consciousness which as a kind of desire is satisfied by another self-consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hegel's Concept of Self-Consciousness|author=Robert B. Pippin|publisher=Uitgeverij Van Gorcum|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NyZOfjkKfpsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Self-consciousness|isbn=9789023246220|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Self-realisation; the realisation of the Self consisting of consciousness that leads all else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads|author=F.Max Muller|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-dq1_WC-Y5gC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=Self-consciousness+in+Upanishads#v=onepage&amp;q=Self-consciousness%20in%20Upanishads&amp;f=false|isbn=9781840221022|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Self-consciousness'' in the [[Upanishad]]s means the knowledge about the existence and nature of [[Brahman]]. It means the consciousness of our own real being, the primary reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theosophy of the Upanishads 1896|publisher=Kessinger Publishing Co.|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y8WknTKS-RYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Self-consciousness+in+Upanishads#v=onepage&amp;q=Self-consciousness%20in%20Upanishads&amp;f=false|isbn=9780766148383|date=2003-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-consciousness means Self-knowledge, the knowledge of Prajna i.e. of Prana which is Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sacred Books of the East|author=Epiphanius Wilson|publisher=Cosimo Inc.|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/?id=h0OyiQte_kUC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=Self-consciousness+in+Upanishads#v=onepage&amp;q=Self-consciousness%20in%20Upanishads&amp;f=false|isbn=9781602063235|date=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Upanishads]] the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or [[Paramatman]] is phenomenally unknowable; it is the object of realisation. The Atman is unknowable in its essential nature; it is unknowable in its essential nature because it is the eternal subject who knows about everything including itself. The Atman is the knower and also the known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=198|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphysicians regard the Self either to be distinct from the Absolute or entirely identical with the Absolute. They have given form to three schools of thought – a) the ''Dualistic school'', b) the ''Quasi-dualistic school'' and c) the ''Monistic school'', as the result of their varying mystical experiences. [[Prakrti]] and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], when treated as two separate and distinct aspects form the basis of the Dualism of the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Religions|author=Warren Mathews|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=73|url= https://books.google.com/?id=l_DdHf43iwoC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=dualism+in+the+upanishads#v=onepage&amp;q=dualism%20in%20the%20upanishads&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0495603856|date=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quasi-dualism is reflected in the Vaishnavite-monotheism of [[Ramanuja]] and the absolute Monism, in the teachings of [[Adi Shankara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Living in Amida's Universal Vow|author=Alfred Bloom|publisher=World Wisdom Inc.|page=249|url= https://books.google.com/?id=KCYMqPcW4M8C&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=Quasi-dualism+in+the+upanishads#v=onepage&amp;q=Quasi-dualism%20in%20the%20upanishads&amp;f=false|isbn=9780941532549|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-consciousness is the Fourth state of consciousness or ''Turiya'', the first three being ''Vaisvanara'', ''[[Taijasa]]'' and ''Prajna''. These are the four states of individual consciousness.

There are three distinct stages leading to Self-realisation. The First stage is in mystically apprehending the glory of the Self within us as though we were distinct from it. The Second stage is in identifying the "I-within" with the Self, that we are in essential nature entirely identical with the pure Self. The Third stage is in realising that the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is [[Brahman]], that there is no difference between the Self and the Absolute. The Fourth stage is in realising "I am the Absolute" - ''[[Aham Brahman Asmi]]''. The Fifth stage is in realising that Brahman is the "All" that exists, as also that which does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=203|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist metaphysics===
In [[Buddhist philosophy]] there are various metaphysical traditions that have proposed different questions about the nature of reality based on the teachings of the Buddha in the early [[Buddhist texts]]. The [[Buddha]] of the early texts does not focus on metaphysical questions but on ethical and spiritual training and in some cases, he dismisses [[the unanswered questions|certain metaphysical questions]] as unhelpful and indeterminate [[Avyakta]], which he recommends should be set aside. The development of systematic metaphysics arose after the Buddha's death with the rise of the [[Abhidharma]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics: The Making of a Philosophical Tradition, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist Abhidharma schools developed their analysis of reality based on the concept of ''dharmas'' which are the ultimate physical and mental events that make up experience and their relations to each other. Noa Ronkin has called their approach "[[Process philosophy|phenomenological]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics: The Making of a Philosophical Tradition, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Later philosophical traditions include the [[Madhyamika]] school of [[Nagarjuna]], which further developed the theory of the emptiness ([[shunyata]]) of all phenomena or dharmas which rejects any kind of [[Dravya (Jainism)|substance]]. This has been interpreted as a form of [[anti-foundationalism]] and anti-realism which sees reality has having no ultimate essence or ground.&lt;ref&gt;Westerhoff, Jan; Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction (2009), Conclusion&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yogacara]] school meanwhile promoted a theory called "awareness only" ([[Yogachara#Vij.C3.B1apti-m.C4.81tra|vijnapti-matra]]) which has been interpreted as a form of [[Idealism]] or [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] and denies the split between awareness itself and the objects of awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Lusthaus, Dan, Buddhist Phenomenology&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic metaphysics===
[[Islamic philosophy#Metaphysics|Islamic metaphysics]] was highly active during Europe's 'Dark Ages', beginning with the arrival and translation of Aristotle into Arabic.

===Scholasticism and the Middle Ages===
Between about 1100 and 1500, philosophy as a discipline took place as part of the [[Catholic church]]'s teaching system, known as [[scholasticism]]. Scholastic philosophy took place within an established
framework blending Christian theology with Aristotelian teachings. Although fundamental orthodoxies were not commonly challenged, there were nonetheless deep metaphysical disagreements, particularly over the [[problem of universals]], which engaged [[Duns Scotus]] and [[Pierre Abelard]]. [[William of Ockham]] is remembered for his principle of ontological parsimony.

===Rationalism and Continental Rationalism===
{{Main|Rationalism}}

In the early modern period (17th and 18th centuries), the system-building ''scope'' of philosophy is often linked to the rationalist ''method'' of philosophy, that is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure reason. The scholastic concepts of substance and accident were employed.
* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] proposed in his [[Monadology]] a plurality of non-interacting substances.
* [[Descartes]] is famous for his [[Mind-body dualism|Dualism]] of material and mental substances.
* [[Spinoza]] believed reality was a [[Monism|single substance]] of God-or-nature.

===British empiricism===
[[British empiricism]] marked something of a reaction to rationalist and system-building metaphysics, or ''speculative'' metaphysics as it was pejoratively termed. The sceptic [[David Hume]] famously declared that most metaphysics should be consigned to the flames (see below). Hume was notorious among his contemporaries as one of the first philosophers to openly doubt religion, but is better known now for his [[David Hume#Causation|critique of causality]]. [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Thomas Reid]] and [[John Locke]] were less sceptical, embracing a more cautious style of metaphysics based on realism, [[common sense]] and science. Other philosophers, notably [[George Berkeley]] were led from empiricism to idealistic metaphysics.

===Wolff===
[[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] had theoretical philosophy divided into an [[ontology]] or ''philosophia prima'' as a general metaphysics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Matt |last=Hettche |title=Christian Wolff. 8.1 Ontology (or Metaphysics Proper) |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/#OntMetPro |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]] |date=November 11, 2014 |accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which arises as a preliminary to the distinction of the [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|three]] "special metaphysics"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Matt |last=Hettche |title=Christian Wolff. 8.

This scheme, which is the counterpart of religious tripartition in creature, creation, and Creator, is best known to philosophical students by Kant's treatment of it in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In the "Preface" of the 2nd edition of Kant's book, Wolff is defined "the greatest of all dogmatic philosophers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Matt |last=Hettche |title=Christian Wolff |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/ |encyclopedia=SEP |date=November 11, 2014 |accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]] attempted a grand synthesis and revision of the trends already mentioned: scholastic philosophy, systematic metaphysics, and skeptical empiricism, not to forget the burgeoning science of his day. As did the systems builders, he had an [[Kantian architectonics|overarching framework]] in which all questions were to be addressed. Like Hume, who famously woke him from his 'dogmatic slumbers', he was suspicious of metaphysical speculation, and also places much emphasis on the limitations of the human mind.
Kant described his shift in metaphysics away from making claims about an objective noumenal world, towards exploring the subjective phenomenal world, as a [[Copernican Revolution]], by analogy to (though opposite in direction to) [[Copernicus]]' shift from man (the subject) to the sun (an object) at the center of the universe.

Kant saw rationalist philosophers as aiming for a kind of metaphysical knowledge he defined as the ''[[analytical-synthetic distinction|synthetic apriori]]''—that is knowledge that does not come from the senses (it is [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]) but is nonetheless about reality (synthetic). Inasmuch as it is about reality, it differs from abstract mathematical propositions (which he terms analytical apriori), and being apriori it is distinct from empirical, scientific knowledge (which he terms synthetic aposteriori). The only synthetic apriori knowledge we can have is of how our minds organise the data of the senses; that organising framework is space and time, which for Kant have no mind-independent existence, but nonetheless operate uniformly in all humans. Apriori knowledge of space and time is all that remains of metaphysics as traditionally conceived. There ''is'' a reality beyond sensory data or phenomena, which he calls the realm of [[noumena]]; however, we cannot know it as it is in itself, but only as it appears to us. He allows himself to speculate that the origins of phenomenal God, morality, and free will ''might'' exist in the noumenal realm, but these possibilities have to be set against its basic unknowability for humans. Although he saw himself as having disposed of metaphysics, in a sense, he has generally been regarded in retrospect as having a metaphysics of his own, and as beginning the modern analytical conception of the subject.

===Kantians===
Nineteenth century philosophy was overwhelmingly influenced by Kant and his successors. [[Schopenhauer]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Fichte]] and [[Hegel]] all purveyed their own panoramic versions of [[German Idealism]], Kant's own caution about metaphysical speculation, and [[Critique of Pure Reason#The Refutation of Idealism|refutation of idealism]], having fallen by the wayside. The idealistic impulse continued into the early twentieth century with [[British idealist]]s such as [[F. H. Bradley]] and [[J. M. E. McTaggart]].  Followers of [[Karl Marx]] took Hegel's dialectic view of history and [[dialectical materialism|re-fashioned it as materialism]].

===Early analytical philosophy and positivism===
During the period when idealism was dominant in philosophy, science had been making great advances. The arrival of a new generation of scientifically minded philosophers led to a sharp decline in the popularity of idealism during the 1920s.

[[Analytical philosophy]] was spearheaded by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G. E. Moore]]. Russell and [[William James]] tried to compromise between idealism and materialism with the theory of [[neutral monism]].

The early to mid twentieth century philosophy saw a trend to reject metaphysical questions as meaningless. The driving force behind this tendency was the philosophy of [[logical positivism]] as espoused by the [[Vienna Circle]], which argued that the meaning of a statement was its prediction of observable results of an experiment, and thus that there is no need to postulate the existence of any objects other than these perceptual observations.

At around the same time, the American pragmatists were steering a middle course between materialism and idealism.
System-building metaphysics, with a fresh inspiration from science, was revived by [[A. N. Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]].

===Continental philosophy===
The forces that shaped analytical philosophy—the break with idealism, and the influence of science—were much less significant outside the English speaking world, although there was a shared turn toward language. Continental philosophy continued in a trajectory from post Kantianism.

The [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of Husserl and others was intended as a collaborative project for the investigation of the features and structure of consciousness common to all humans, in line with Kant's basing his synthetic apriori on the uniform operation of consciousness. It was officially neutral with regards to ontology, but was nonetheless to spawn a number of metaphysical systems. [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]]'s concept of [[intentionality]] would become widely influential, including on analytical philosophy.

[[Heidegger]], author of ''[[Being and Time]]'', saw himself as re-focusing on Being-qua-being, introducing the novel concept of ''[[Dasein]]'' in the process. Classing himself an [[existentialist]], [[Sartre]] wrote an extensive study of ''[[Being and Nothingness]]''.

The [[speculative realism]] movement marks a return to full blooded realism.

===Process metaphysics===
{{Further|Process philosophy}}

There are two fundamental aspects of everyday experience: change and persistence. Until recently, the Western philosophical tradition has arguably championed substance and persistence, with some notable exceptions, however. According to process thinkers, novelty, flux and accident do matter, and sometimes they constitute the ultimate reality.

In a broad sense, process metaphysics is as old as Western philosophy, with figures such as Heraclitus, Plotinus, Duns Scotus, Leibniz, David Hume, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, Gustav Theodor Fechner, Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg, Charles Renouvier, Karl Marx, Ernst Mach, Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, Émile Boutroux, Henri Bergson, Samuel Alexander and Nicolas Berdyaev. It seemingly remains an open question whether major "Continental" figures such as the late Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, or Jacques Derrida should be included.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), [https://chromatika.academia.edu/MichelWeber After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics], Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, ontos verlag, 2004, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a strict sense, process metaphysics may be limited to the works of a few founding fathers: G. W. F. Hegel, Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, Henri Bergson, [[Alfred North Whitehead|A. N. Whitehead]], and John Dewey. From a European perspective, there was a very significant and early Whiteheadian influence on the works of outstanding scholars such as Émile Meyerson (1859–1933), Louis Couturat (1868–1914), Jean Wahl (1888–1974), Robin George Collingwood (1889–1943), Philippe Devaux (1902–1979), Hans Jonas (1903–1993), Dorothy M. Emmett (1904–2000), Maurice Merleau Ponty (1908–1961), Enzo Paci (1911–1976), Charlie Dunbar Broad (1887–1971), Wolfe Mays (1912–), Ilya Prigogine (1917–2003), Jules Vuillemin (1920–2001), Jean Ladrière (1921–), Gilles Deleuze (1925–1995), Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–), and Reiner Wiehl (1929–2010).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), [https://chromatika.academia.edu/MichelWeber After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics], Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, ontos verlag, 2004, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary analytical philosophy===
While early analytic philosophy tended to reject metaphysical theorizing, under the influence of logical positivism, it was revived in the second half of the twentieth century. Philosophers such as [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David K. Lewis]] and [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]] developed elaborate theories on a range of topics such as universals, causation, possibility and necessity and abstract objects. However, the focus of analytical philosophy generally is away from the construction of all-encompassing systems and toward close analysis of individual ideas.

Among the developments that led to the revival of metaphysical theorizing were [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine's]] attack on the [[analytic–synthetic distinction]], which was generally taken to undermine [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap's]] distinction between existence questions internal to a framework and those external to it.&lt;ref&gt;S. Yablo and A. Gallois, "Does Ontology Rest on a Mistake?", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes, Vol. 72, (1998), pp. 229–261, 263–283 [http://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/om.pdf first part]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[philosophy of fiction]], the problem of empty names, and the debate over existence's status as a property have all come of relative obscurity into the limelight, while perennial issues such as free will, possible worlds, and the [[philosophy of time]] have had new life breathed into them.&lt;ref&gt;Everett, Anthony and Thomas Hofweber (eds.) (2000), ''Empty Names, Fiction and the Puzzles of Non-Existence.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Inwagen, Peter, and Dean Zimmerman (eds.) (1998), ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The analytic view is of metaphysics as studying phenomenal human concepts rather than making claims about the noumenal world, so its style often blurs into [[philosophy of language]] and introspective psychology.   Compared to system-building, it can seem very dry, stylistically similar to computer programming, mathematics or even accountancy (as a common stated goal is to "account for" entities in the world).  Despite, or perhaps because of, this scientific dryness, it is generally regarded as having made "progress" where other schools have not.   For example, concepts from analytical metaphysics are now routinely employed and cited as useful guides in computational ontologies for [[databases]] and to frame computer [[natural language processing]] and [[knowledge representation]] software.

In philosophy, '''noetics''' is a branch of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] philosophy concerned with the study of mind as well as intellect.

==Philosophy==
In [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] and [[medieval philosophy]], noetic topics included the doctrine of the [[active intellect]] ([[Aristotle]], [[Averroes]])&lt;ref&gt;Daniel D. De Haan (2010).  [https://stthom.academia.edu/DanielHaan/Papers/288652/Aristotles_De_Anima_A_Common_Point_of_Departure_for_Averroistic_and_Thomistic_Noetics "Aristotle's De Anima: A Common Point of Departure for Averroistic and Thomistic Noetics?"].&lt;/ref&gt; and the doctrine of the [[Nous#Plotinus and neoplatonism|Divine Intellect]] ([[Plotinus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. Wallis. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Neoplatonism_and_gnosticism.html?id=WSbrLPup7wYC ''Neoplatonism and Gnosticism'']. SUNY Press, 1992, p. 99ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
Since the 1970s and the foundation of the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]], the term "noetics" has been adopted by several authors such as [[Christian de Quincey]] in ''Deep Spirit: Cracking the Noetic Code'' (2008) and [[Dan Brown]] in ''[[The Lost Symbol]]'' (2009), who write about consciousness and spirituality.

The Institute of Noetic Sciences describes '''noetic sciences''' as "how beliefs, thoughts, and intentions affect the physical world".

'''Owen Flanagan''' (born 1949) is the [[James B. Duke Professor]] of [[Philosophy]] and Professor of [[Neurobiology]] at [[Duke University]]. Flanagan has done work in [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of psychology]], [[philosophy of social science]], [[ethics]], [[Contemporary ethics|contemporary ethical theory]], [[moral psychology]], as well as on [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] conceptions of the self.

==Biography==
Flanagan earned his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Boston University]] and his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Fordham University]]. He taught for many years at [[Wellesley College]] before moving to Duke.

Flanagan has written extensively on [[consciousness]]. He has been realistic about the difficulty of consciousness as a scientific and philosophical problem, but optimistic about the chance of solving the problem. One of the problems in a study of consciousness is the hidden way in which conscious states are dependent on brain states. Flanagan has proposed that there is a "natural method" to go about understanding consciousness that involves creating a science of mind. Three key elements of this developing science are: paying attention to subjective reports on conscious experiences, incorporating the results from [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], and including the results from [[neuroscience]] that will reveal how neuronal systems produce consciousness.

Flanagan is also responsible for bringing attention to the relevance of empirical psychology on the way we think of moral psychology. His efforts spawned the modern field of moral psychology.&lt;ref name=Flanagan1991&gt;Flanagan, Owen, &lt;u&gt;Varieties of Moral Personality&lt;/u&gt;, Harvard University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Cites book by the subject of the article, not acceptable for claiming creation of a modern discipline|date=February 2015}}

Flanagan was also one of the first moral philosophers to see the relevance of developments in social psychology to ethics.

Flanagan is currently on the Editorial Board of Greater Good Magazine, published by the [[Greater Good Science Center]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  Flanagan's contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships.  He is also an active member of the Center for Pragmatic Buddhism's (CPB) Advisory Council.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1256">'''Preformation theory''' is a [[Theism|theistic]] [[epistemology|epistemological]] [[philosophical theory|theory]] that states that [[knowledge]] is possible only because [[God]] has endowed humans with certain [[Innatism|innate ideas]] along with [[disposition]]s or aptitudes in certain ways. This was recognized by [[Immanuel Kant]] as an alternative to his theory regarding the categories of understanding and their source. 

==Overview==
According to Kant's view the aptitudes are both innate and ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' not given by a creator. Contrary to Kant's position, the preformation theory avoids skepticism about the nature of the noumenal world (Kant believed that the real world is unknowable).  It does so by claiming that the rational structures of the human mind are similar to the rational order of the real world because both are created by God to work together, and this similarity makes the attaining of accurate knowledge about the real world possible.

Also, see [[Preformationism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4816">'''Rafael Gutiérrez Girardot''' (5 May 1928 in [[Sogamoso]], Colombia – 26 May 2005 in [[Bonn]], Germany) was an [[expatriate]] Colombian [[philosopher]], professor, translator and publisher.

==Career==
Rafael Guitérrez Giardot's father, a [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservative]] politician, was assassinated when Rafael was still a boy, prompting him to find solace and meaning through his studies. In 1947, Rafael attended classes at the recently created Institute of Philosophy at the [[National University of Colombia]]. Many of his early essays from this time appeared in the literary section of the conservative daily ''[[El Nuevo Siglo|El Siglo]]'', and he participated in the formation of a short-lived rightist political movement called "Revolución Nacional".&lt;ref name="LA"&gt;[http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/biografias/gutirafa.htm Biblioteca Luís Ángel Arango: Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, disturbed by [[La Violencia]] and frustrated by what he felt was the poor quality of education in Colombia, Rafael left to study philosophy in Europe. His student work attracted the attention of [[Martin Heidegger]], who personally invited him to come to Germany in 1953. He enrolled at the [[University of Freiburg]], where he took his doctorate and met his wife, Marliese.&lt;ref name="RA"&gt;[http://www.revistaaleph.com.co/component/k2/item/370-rafael-gutierrez-girardot-1928-2005.html Revista Aleph: Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, through his friend [[Eduardo Cote Lamus]], who was the [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] in Frankfurt, Rafael obtained a position as translator for the Colombian embassy in Bonn. He was later promoted to [[Cultural Attaché]]. In 1959, Rafael and Francisco Pérez González founded the publishing house "Taurus", which presented many German authors in Spanish translation for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ua.es/es/histrad/documentos/biografias/rafael-gutierrez-girardot.pdf University of Alicante: Biografías de traductores]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafael's literary work did not distract him from issues involving education. In 1965, in response to a [[UNESCO]] proposal for reforming Latin-American universities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/paideiainvestigativa/la-universidad-latinoamericana-rudolph-atcon Slideshare: "La Universidad Latinoamerica" by Rudolph P. Atcon, complete text]&lt;/ref&gt; he published an essay, "Ten Theses on a Theme: The Private University and Underdevelopment", where he accused the private universities of destroying "the people", fomenting [[classism]], creating social violence, promoting studies to serve the interests of [[imperialism]], lowering the quality of scientific research and corrupting academic ethics.&lt;ref name="LA" /&gt;

The following year, Rafael was dismissed from his position at the embassy and transferred to the Ministry of External Affairs in Bogotá. While there, he taught at several universities. His continuing disillusionment with the university system in Colombia led him to return to Germany in 1969, where he became involved in social research at the [[University of Münster]].&lt;ref name="RA" /&gt; Finally, in 1970, he became a full professor at the [[University of Bonn]], where he helped create their Hispanic Studies department. He held that position until his retirement in 1993. Shortly thereafter, he was named [[Professor Emeritus]]. Despite his self-imposed exile, throughout these years he continued to contribute articles to several Latin-American newspapers and magazines. In 2002, he received the [[Alfonso Reyes International Prize]] for his lifetime achievements.

In [[philosophy]] and [[artificial intelligence]] (especially, knowledge based systems), the '''ramification problem''' is concerned with the indirect consequences of an action. It might also be posed as ''how to represent what happens implicitly due to an action'' or how to control the secondary and tertiary effects of an action. It is strongly connected to, and is opposite the [[qualification problem|qualification side]] of, the [[frame problem]].

Limit theory helps in [[operational]] usage. For instance, in [[Knowledge-based engineering|KBE]] derivation of a populated design (geometrical objects, etc., similar concerns apply in shape theory), equivalence assumptions allow convergence where potentially large, and perhaps even computationally indeterminate, solution sets are handled deftly. Yet, in a chain of computation, downstream events may very well find some types of results from earlier resolutions of '''ramification''' as problematic for their own algorithms.

'''Robert Todd Carroll''' (May 18, 1945 – August 25, 2016)  was an American writer and academic. Carroll was best known for his contributions in the field of [[scientific skepticism|skepticism]]; he achieved notability by publishing ''The Skeptic's Dictionary'' online in 1994. He was elected a fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert|title=Biographical Information Robert T.

He was a professor of philosophy at [[Sacramento City College]] from 1977 until his retirement in 2007.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

== Early life ==
Carroll was born in [[Joliet, Illinois]] on May 18, 1945.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; His father worked in a coal processing plant. The family moved to [[San Diego]] in 1954 where Carroll grew up. He described his early years in [[Ocean Beach, San Diego|Ocean Beach]] as an ideal childhood. He was raised [[Catholic]].&lt;ref name="kdvs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/sounds/kdvs.rm|title=KDVS, Printed matter on the air, Interview with Bob Carroll|last1=Sherwin|first1=Elisabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll went to the [[University of San Diego High School]], the same school that [[Phil Mickelson]] and [[Scott Peterson]] attended. After that, he received a Catholic education in [[the University of Notre Dame]]. He went into [[seminary]] in Notre Dame, he eventually left after a short time in 1965 and went back to San Diego. Carroll earned his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1974 at the [[University of California, San Diego]],  writing his doctoral thesis under the direction of [[Richard H. Popkin]] on the religious philosophy of [[Edward Stillingfleet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-010-1598-1/page/1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402205331/http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-010-1598-1/page/1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-04-02|title=The Common-Sense Philosophy of Religion of Bishop Edward Stillingfleet 1635–1699|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert|doi=10.1007/978-94-010-1598-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; who defended the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church passionately against Catholic, deist and atheist offenders before becoming [[Bishop of Worcester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jean-Michel|first=Vienne|title=Robert Todd Carroll, The Common Sense Philosophy of Religion of Bishop Edward Stillingfleet, 1635–1699|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/xvii_0291-3798_1977_num_5_1_935_t1_0079_0000_1|journal=XVII-XVIII. Bulletin de la société d'études anglo-américaines des XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles|volume=5|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was published in 1975.&lt;ref name="kdvs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Todd Carroll, ''The common-sense philosophy of religion of bishop Edward Stillingfleet 1635–1699'', Nijhoff, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; By then Carroll was married with two daughters. The new family moved to [[Susanville, California|Susanville]], [[California]] where he started teaching philosophy at [[Lassen Community College]]. After that he moved to the [[Sacramento]] area, he has been living in [[Davis, California|Davis]] since 1977.&lt;ref name="kdvs" /&gt;

Carroll said that he never went through a religion [[Apostasy|deconversion]] moment; instead he had a long journey that led him to disbelief. He first started having strong doubts about [[Catholicism]] when he went into Seminary in Notre Dame. He became intrigued by eastern religions after leaving the Seminary. Inspired by [[Alan Watts]], he started looking at eastern religions' holy books. Carroll became interested in [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] and attended his [[Self-Realization Fellowship]] group to do yoga and chanting, he identified as [[agnostic]] at the time. After leaving the fellowship, he spent many years thinking in depth about his religion. He said "The more I thought about religious ideas, the more false and absurd they seem to me." Carroll became enchanted by the ideas of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], namely the idea that religious beliefs require a leap of faith because they cannot be rationally proven. Instead, Carroll decided to take a leap in the other direction: he said that he "found many reasons for disbelief and absolutely no reasons for belief", and that his former religious beliefs lost their attractiveness.&lt;ref name="kdvs" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Professor ===
Carroll's teaching career started with a part-time position teaching philosophy at [[Lassen Community College]]. He taught philosophy of religion at [[American River College]] for two years before going full-time in Sacramento City College where he taught introductory philosophy classes, logic and critical reasoning, law justice and punishment and critical thinking about the paranormal for three decades (1977–2007) as well as serving several years as chairman.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skepticality2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticality.com/skepdic/|title=Interview: w/Bob Carroll of Skepdic|last2=McCarthy|first2=Robynn|date=August 22, 2005|website=skepticality.com|last1=Colanduno|first1=Derek|authorlink1=Derek Colanduno|authorlink2=Robynn McCarthy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/news/show/sixteen_notable_figures_in_science_and_skepticism_elected_csi_fellows/|title=Sixteen Notable Figures in Science and Skepticism Elected CSI Fellows|accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/bob_carroll_defining_skepticism/|title=Bob Carroll – Defining Skepticism|date=April 16, 2010|website=pointofinquiry.org|last1=Stollznow|first1=Karen|authorlink=Karen Stollznow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writer ===
Carroll authored ''Becoming a Critical Thinker'', a textbook for introductory logic and critical thinking courses. It covers subjects such as language and critical thinking, the mass media and other sources of information, fallacies of reasoning, and inductive and deductive arguments.&lt;ref name="nemonox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burburinho.com/20030809.html|title=[ burburinho – conversa com bob carroll ]|website=www.burburinho.com|last1=Nox|first1=Nemo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is subtitled ''A Guide for the New Millennium''. [[Pearson Education]]al published the first edition in 2000 and the second edition was published in 2005.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; ''Becoming a Critical Thinker'' was born out of Carroll's classwork during his time in Sacramento City College.&lt;ref name="kdvs" /&gt;

''The Skeptic's Dictionary'' is the print version of the website skepdic.com and is available in Dutch, English, Japanese, Korean, and Russian.&lt;ref name="sydney"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/sydneyinterview.html|title=Sydney interview - the Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|website=skepdic.com|publisher=Sydney Herald|last1=Casimir|first1=Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides definitions, arguments, and essays on supernatural, occult, paranormal, and pseudo-scientific subjects.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/intro.html|title=Introduction - the Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|website=skepdic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book features many examples of pseudoscientific beliefs over its eight chapters. In the last chapter, Carroll provided ways to improve critical thinking and skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Harriet|authorlink=Harriet A. Hall|title=Thinking: An Unnatural Act – CSI|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/thinking_an_unnatural_act|website=www.csicop.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the website, it takes a skeptical stance, typically assuming that something is false until proven otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Popular Science Review – The Skeptic's Dictionary|url=http://www.popularscience.co.uk/reviews/rev66.htm|website=www.popularscience.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124035908/http://www.popularscience.co.uk/reviews/rev66.htm|archive-date=2011-11-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/18/anthonyburgess|title=Non-fiction: Oct 18|date=2003-10-18|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book came about when Ted Weinstein, a literary agent, contacted Carroll about creating the book. The book was eventually published by John Wiley &amp; Son in August 2003 as an inexpensive paperback.&lt;ref name="nemonox" /&gt; The book is intended to be biased towards the skeptical side;&lt;ref name="sydney" /&gt; it is not targeted towards true believers.&lt;ref name="preface" /&gt;

Carroll also wrote a children's version of the Skeptic's dictionary which was released online on July 22, 2011. In 2013, it was published as a children's book under the title ''Mysteries and Science: Exploring Aliens, Ghosts, Monsters, the End of the World and Other Weird Things''. He also wrote ''Unnatural Acts: Critical Thinking, Skepticism, and Science Exposed!'' which was initially published by the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] as an e-book in 2011. A paperback version is available from [[Lulu (company)|Lulu]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; ''The Critical Thinker's Dictionary'' was published in 2013. It features short articles about [[cognitive bias]]es and [[Formal fallacy|logical fallacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Harriet|title=How to Think « Science-Based Medicine|authorlink=Harriet A. Hall|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/how-to-think/|website=www.sciencebasedmedicine.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skeptic ===
A long-time advocate of [[scientific skepticism]] and [[critical thinking]], Carroll said that he had been investigating controversial beliefs since he was seven years old when he had doubts about [[Santa Claus]].&lt;ref name="phil" /&gt; Carroll described the importance of critical thinking and open-mindedness in the following quotation:
{{Quote|text="If you are willing to be open minded, accept that reasonable probabilities rather than absolute certainties are the best information in many things that matter. And hold your most precious beliefs tentatively, then you can overcome some of the hindrances to critical thinking at least some of the time. And also that one's world view can be a major hindrance to being fair minded. The minimum requirement of fair mindedness is a willingness to take seriously viewpoints opposed to your own. In other words, you have to be willing to admit that you are wrong. Or that you might be wrong"|source=Bob Carroll interview with Consider This &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stuart|last=Campbell|title=Interview with consider this|url=http://considerthis.us/wp-content/uploads/podcast/Consider%20This%201-4-2013.mp3}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=Robert Todd Carroll}}

Carroll's background in philosophy meant that he was well versed in [[philosophical skepticism]]. His area of specialization was 17th century British philosophy, namely [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of religion]].  Carroll's skeptical career started with his teaching career. However, he did not start writing skeptical content until 1992 when both Carroll's best friend and his father-in-law died within the same week. These circumstances profoundly affected Carroll and made him realize his own mortality, providing the catalyst that started his skeptical writing.&lt;ref name="cadena"&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Cadena|url=http://skepdic.com/cadenainterview.html|title=interview with the Skeptic magazine by Richard Cadena|website=skepdic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with Beyond a Doubt's Blair Anthony Robertson, Carroll described the influence of this incident: "It was like the deaths of these two people had forced me to start looking at everything and not take anything for granted. All these times I had said that someday I am going to do this or go there, I decided to just do it."&lt;ref name="beyond"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/refuge/beyondadoubt.html|title=Blair Anthony Robertson interviews Bob Carroll about the Skeptic's Dictionary|website=skepdic.com|publisher=Sacramento Bee|first=Blair|last=Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Carroll and his wife attended free training organized by Davis Community Network in which they learned about the Internet and e-mail as well as HTML code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|url=http://skepdic.com/about.html|website=skepdic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="token"&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Kylie Sturgess|url=http://tokenskeptic.org/2011/09/18/episode-seventy-seven-on-the-skeptics-dictionary-for-kids-interview-with-robert-todd-carroll/|title=Episode Seventy-Seven – On The Skeptic's Dictionary For Kids – Interview With Robert Todd Carroll|website=Token Skeptic|last1=Sturgess|first1=Kylie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Carroll started the Skeptic's Dictionary website with just ten articles that he had written for his students about logic and pseudoscience.&lt;ref name="kdvs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skepticality2006" /&gt; The website is considered among the first to use [[hypertext]].&lt;ref name="phil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beyond" /&gt; The potential for including links to external materials was  part of the appeal of publishing on the internet for Carroll. {{As of|2016|4}}, the website has more than 5,500 files and 85,000+ hyperlinks.&lt;ref name="preface"&gt;[http://www.skepdic.com/preface.html Preface], ''Skeptic's Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; The website had been a one-man project since its inception. Although it never had a staff behind it, several translators volunteered to translate it into more than a dozen languages and several volunteer editors have provided assistance.&lt;ref name="nemonox" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/acknowledgments.html|title=Acknowledgements - The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|website=skepdic.com|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Carroll's mind, The Skeptic's Dictionary wasn't an encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="skepticality2006"/&gt; He saw it as a source of skeptical arguments intended for skeptics to counterbalance the arguments on the other side rather than being targeted towards true believers.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; {{As of|2016|4}}, the site had grown to 784 articles that included definitions, arguments, and essays on subjects supernatural, occult, paranormal, and pseudoscientific.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; {{As of|2016|4}}, it attracted more than four hundred thousand visitors per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skepdic.com Traffic Statistics|url=https://www.similarweb.com/website/skepdic.com|website=SimilarWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Skeptics’ Dictionary was inspired by ''[[Pierre Bayle]]'s [[Historical and Critical Dictionary]]'' in both its name&lt;ref name="skepticality2006" /&gt; and its biased stance. Carroll was most intrigued by the [[Baruch Spinoza]] entry in Bayle's dictionary; he described its influence in an interview with [[Point of Inquiry]]'s [[Karen Stollznow]]:
{{Quote|text="Bayles's dictionary was definitely biased in the sense that he would do a biography or entry on like say atheism, and his entry on atheism would be an essay and the essay would question common beliefs about atheism mainly being that atheists are immoral [[libertines]] and so on, and so his essay on atheism held Spinoza as the model atheist"|source=Point of Inquiry, Bob Carroll – Defining Skepticism&lt;ref name="poi" /&gt;|author=Robert Todd Carroll}}

Carroll created skeptical blogs such as Mass Media Bunk and Mass Media Funk (they were replaced by Skeptimedia in 2007). He also maintained Skeptimedia and Suburban Myths blogs in addition to skepdic.com.

On March 27, 2012, Carroll began a regular segment on the podcast ''[[Skepticality]]'' entitled ''Unnatural Virtue'' in which he commented on topics in critical thinking and skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticality.com/dictionaries-bugs-space/|title=Episode 179|last=Colanduno|first=Derek|authorlink=Derek Colanduno|publisher=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic Magazine]]|accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/UnnaturalVirtue.html|title=Unnatural Virtue – podcast episodes on Skepticality – the Skeptic's Dictionary|website=www.skepdic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The segment ran until April 29, 2014 for thirty-one episodes.

Carroll spoke at several skeptic conferences. In 2003, he was invited to give a talk at the first [[The Amaz!ng Meeting|Amaz!ng Meeting]]. In the same year he gave a speech at the [[Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] conference on frauds and hoaxes.  In 2004, he gave a speech to the Irish Skeptics in Dublin on scientific proof for the paranormal.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; In 2007, he conducted a critical thinking workshop at the 5th Amazing Meeting. On May 29, 2011, Carroll led a discussion concerning the "Five Myths About Skeptics" at the 2nd annual SkeptiCalCon event held in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticalcon.org/|title=SkeptiCalCon 2011|year=2011|publisher=|accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll's views attracted numerous interviews for him from mainstream media and local newspapers, such as the ''[[Davis, CA|Davis]] Enterprise''&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Sherwin, "Author attempts to debunk angels, other 'strange beliefs'", ''Davis Enterprise'', 29 Dec 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was quoted in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/06/technology/youve-been-scammed-again-maybe-the-problem-isnt-your-computer.html|title=You've Been Scammed Again? Maybe the Problem Isn't Your Computer|last=Jr|first=Tom Zeller|date=2005-06-06|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he was interviewed by representatives of [[List of skeptics and skeptical organizations|groups promoting scientific skepticism]], such as the [[New England Skeptical Society]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Perry DeAngelis]], "Interview with Robert Todd Carroll", ''New England Skeptical Society Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; and Media Man Australia.&lt;ref name="mediaman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tingle|first1=Greg|title=Media Man Australia – The Online Home of Greg Tingle – Journalist and TV Presenter|url=http://www.mediaman.com.au/interviews/skepdic.html|website=mediaman.com.au|date=21 Apr 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010 Carroll was elected as a Fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="sixteen" /&gt;

In an interview with [[Point of Inquiry]]'s [[Karen Stollznow]], Carroll hinted that he did not earn a substantial amount of money from his skeptical work: "If we talk about the money we make from skepticism we might set a record for the shortest interview ever." However, he insisted that everybody should be a skeptic because, he said, it is a healthy way of approaching life. He said that skeptics' meetups and conferences, as well as the positive feedback he received on his work were his main motivations.&lt;ref name="poi" /&gt;

In May 2016, Carroll announced that he would no longer be able to write the Skeptic's Dictionary monthly newsletter on account of his illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Sharon|title=End of an era: the last Skeptic’s Dictionary newsletter|url=https://idoubtit.wordpress.com/2016/05/22/end-of-an-era-the-last-skeptics-dictionary-newsletter/|website=Doubtful ~ Sharon Hill|date=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

=== Jon Barron===
After Carroll wrote a Skepdic.com entry about Jon Barron criticizing his "Barron Effect",{{ref|Alpha|α}} Barron replied with a piece on his website titled "Rebutting a Skeptic" in which he replied to Carroll's Skepdic.com entries concerning [[alternative medicine]] such as "Cellular energy's relation to cancer"; "Mercury, thimerosal, vaccines, and chelation"; "The need for supplements" and "Fecal matter in the colon". In the piece he accused Carroll of deliberately misinterpreting evidence, as well as taking issue with a distorted personal picture that Carroll had posted on skepdic.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barron|first1=Jon|title=Rebutting a Skeptic|url=http://jonbarron.org/rebutting-skeptic#footnote1_4z7zs70|website=jonbarron.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Richard Milton ===
After Carroll published a piece online labelling [[Richard Milton (author)|Richard Milton]]'s writings on alternative science as "Internet Bunk", Milton responded by accusing Carroll of being a "pseudo-skeptic", and claimed to show that Carroll had fabricated quotations and misrepresented his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sces.info/skepdic-com.html|title=the Skeptic's Dictionary|accessdate=2013-07-01|author=Richard Milton|authorlink=Richard Milton (author)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902152331/http://www.sces.info/skepdic-com.html|archivedate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll countered these accusations in an addendum to his piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/refuge/altscience.html|title=Internet Bunk|author=Robert Todd Carroll|accessdate=2013-07-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706141556/http://skepdic.com/refuge/altscience.html|archivedate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rupert Sheldrake ===
Carroll wrote two Skeptic's Dictionary entries that criticize [[Rupert Sheldrake]]'s ideas. The first criticized Sheldrake's [[N'kisi|N'kisi Project]], which is a set of experiments that claim to have proven the existence of a telepathic link between N'kisi (a [[grey parrot]]) and its owner Aimee Morgana. Carroll criticized Sheldrake for omitting 60% of the data he collected when calculating the statistical significance of the parrot's responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheldrake.org/research/animal-powers/the-nkisi-project|title=The Nkisi Project|website=www.sheldrake.org|last1=Sheldrake|first1=Rupert|authorlink=Rupert Sheldrake}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/nkisi.html|title=N'kisi &amp; the N'kisi Project - the Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|website=skepdic.com|first=Robert|last=Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sheldrake"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheldrake.org/reactions/rupert-replies-to-robert-todd-carroll|title=Rupert replies to Robert Todd Carroll|website=www.sheldrake.org|last1=Sheldrake|first1=Rupert|authorlink=Rupert Sheldrake}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll also wrote an entry in his Mass Media Bunk blog criticizing [[Jane Goodall]] for her involvement in the N'kisi Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/refuge/bunk33.html|title=mass media bunk 33: Jane goodall and Talking to the Animals|website=skepdic.com|first=Robert|last=Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second entry challenged Sheldrake's [[morphic resonance]] idea, in which Sheldrake proposed that each species has a "morphogenetic field" that evolves similarly to how the species' genes might evolve. He then proposed that these fields organize the nervous system's activity and can act as a collective memory for the whole species, and that these fields get passed down into the species by a kind of resonance called morphic resonance.&lt;ref name="sheldrake" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/morphicres.html|title=morphic resonance - the Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|website=skepdic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheldrake.org/research/morphic-resonance/introduction|title=Morphic Resonance and Mophic Fields an Introduction|website=www.sheldrake.org|last1=Sheldrake|first1=Rupert|authorlink=Rupert Sheldrake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheldrake replied to Carroll's criticism by writing an article on his website defending his own arguments and accusing Carroll of committing several logical fallacies, misusing his scientific knowledge, misinterpreting and manipulating data, as well as being prejudiced. He also criticized The Skeptic's Dictionary, claiming that it would not survive had it been subject to independent peer reviews.&lt;ref name="sheldrake" /&gt;

== Views on religion ==
Carroll did not believe in an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent god.&lt;ref name="mediaman" /&gt;  However, in his essay "Why I am not an atheist", Carroll described his dislike of the term "atheist" because he felt that the term was being exploited by theists and used as a straw man argument. He felt that the term implied a dogmatic set of beliefs and carried its own share of negative baggage. So, Carroll suggested that atheists might as well adopt the term "[[Brights]]" with all its negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/essays/notanatheist.html|title=Why I am not an atheist by Robert T. Carroll - The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|website=skepdic.com|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only religion that Carroll found attractive after abandoning Catholicism, despite never following it, was [[Buddhism]] as taught by the [[Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref name="kdvs" /&gt;

Carroll always maintained the opinion that people have to be more skeptical of religion than they are now.&lt;ref name="phil" /&gt; He said in multiple interviews that religion is an area that skeptics don't target enough,&lt;ref name="phil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cadena" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/sounds/Spin1038Dublin.mp3|title=Dublin Interview with Bob Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that pure faith is winning the race against critical thinking.&lt;ref name="nemonox" /&gt;

Carroll tended to have a moderate outlook on religion. He believed that religion has a role to play in people's lives and he didn't condemn religion for terrorism. When asked about the relationship between violence and religion he said that he can't recall anything negative about his religious upbringing, and that maybe Catholicism can provide more good than harm. He didn't believe religion causes wars, he rather believed that it serves as an excuse for people who will go to war regardless of religion's existence.&lt;ref name="kdvs" /&gt; Carroll believed that some people rely on religion as their only source of morality and as a source of comfort.&lt;ref name="cadena" /&gt; However, he found it distressing that some people are unable to find meaning in their lives without religion.&lt;ref name="phil" /&gt; In an interview with Beyond a Doubt he said 
{{Quote|text="There is nothing dull about a life without fairies, Easter bunnies, devils, ghosts, magic crystals, etc. Life is only boring to boring people."|source=&lt;ref name="beyond" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert|title=FAQ &amp; Interviews - The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|url=http://skepdic.com/faq.html|website=skepdic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=Robert Todd Carroll}}

== Personal life ==

In May 2014, Carroll was diagnosed with stage IV [[Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor|pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer]] and [[liver metastasis]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary Newsletter- Skepdic.com|url=http://www.skepdic.com/news/newsletter1307.html|website=www.skepdic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 2016, Carroll died in a local hospital in [[Davis, California]].&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sacbee/obituary.aspx?n=robert-todd-carroll&amp;pid=181699431&amp;|title=Robert Todd Carroll (1945 - 2016) Obituary|last=|first=|date=|website=legacy.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sit Down and Shut Up: Punk Rock Commentaries on Buddha, God, Truth, Sex, Death, &amp; Dogen's Treasury of the Right Dharma Eye''''' is a book written by [[Brad Warner]], an author and ordained [[Zen]] priest.  The work serves as both an autobiography and an introduction to [[Dogen]]'s (道元) work ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]'' (正法眼蔵), (''Treasury of the Right Dharma Eye'').&lt;ref name="genji"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genjipress.com/2011/12/sit-down-and-shut-up-punk-rock.html |title=Books: Sit Down and Shut Up |accessdate=May 17, 2012 |publisher=Genji Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The book received mixed reviews. ''[[Metro Silicon Valley|MetroActive]]'' stated "At times Warner comes off as pandering, with his cutesy pop-culture tangents and I-know-what-you're-thinking-right-now comments"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metroactive.com/metro/05.23.07/sit-down-and-shut-up-0721.html |title=Sit Down and Shut Up |accessdate=May 17, 2012 |quote= |publisher=[[Metro Silicon Valley|MetroActive]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly|Buddhadharma]]'' ultimately summed the book up with "Too much of an adolescent rant for most Zen readers and too much of a middle-aged strut down memory lane for most punk readers, ''Sit Down and Shut Up'' will likely get an enthusiastic reception only from the small group of readers who already identify as Zen punks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/web-archive/2007/6/1/book-briefs.html |title=Book Briefs |author=Benjamin Bogin | journal =[[Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly]] | issue =June 2007 |accessdate=May 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Razorcake]]'', however, stated "Irreverent, cocksure, glib, and wise, this is one damn good book.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.razorcake.org/punk-book-reviews/sit-down-and-shut-up-punk-rock-commentaries-on-buddha-god-truth-sex-death-by-brad-warner-1495-255-pgs |title=Sit Down and Shut Up |accessdate=May 17, 2012 |publisher=[[Razorcake]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received positive reviews from ''EnlightenNext'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j38/reviews.asp |title=Natural Selection |accessdate=May 17, 2012 |publisher=EnlightenNext |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120803040747/http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j38/reviews.asp |archivedate=August 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Shambhala Sun]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3136&amp;Itemid=247 |title=Buddhism’s Young Turks |accessdate=May 17, 2012 |publisher=[[Shambhala Sun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Genji Press''.&lt;ref name="genji"/&gt;

Warner himself noted that he received some criticism of his handling of [[polyamory]] in the book.&lt;ref name="reality"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitysandwich.com/zen_trickster|title=Zen Trickster: A Talk with Brad Warner|publisher=Reality Sandwich|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A certain number of the polyamory people have gotten on my case about it. I don't hear from them directly, but I made the huge mistake of reading my Amazon customer reviews recently, and there was someone there who complained that I'd completely misconstrued the philosophy of polyamory -- so there's that contingent. Then you've got a certain number of the more traditional Buddhist crowd, who've never even heard of polyamory, who think I take a much too positive view of it. I feel that if I'm somewhere in the middle of those two sets of opinions, I must be doing something right.&lt;ref name="reality"/&gt;}}

[[Baroness]] '''Suzanne Lilar''' ([[née]] ''Suzanne Verbist''; 21 May 1901 – 12 December 1992) was a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[Belgian]] [[essayist]], [[novelist]], and [[playwright]] writing in [[French language|French]]. She was the wife of the Belgian Minister of Justice [[Albert Lilar]] and mother of the writer [[Françoise Mallet-Joris]] and the art historian Marie Fredericq-Lilar.

She was a member of the Royal Academy of French Language and Literature from 1952 to 1992.

==Life==

Lilar's mother was a [[middle school]] [[teacher]], her father a [[railway]] [[station master]].  After having lived her youth in Ghent, and following a brief first marriage, she moved to [[Antwerp]] where she became the first woman lawyer, and where in 1929 she married the lawyer [[Albert Lilar]] who would later become a [[Minister of Justice]] and [[Minister of State]] (Liberal Party).  She was the mother of the [[writer]] [[Françoise Mallet-Joris]] (b. 1930) and the 18th century [[art historian]] Marie Fredericq-Lilar (b. 1934).  After the death of her husband in 1976, she left Antwerp and relocated to [[Brussels]] in 1977.

==Education==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Image-S.Lilar,M.Fredericq-Lilar.jpg|150px|thumb|right|''S. Lilar with daughter Marie Fredericq-Lilar, 1980'']] --&gt;
[[File:S.Lilar by C. Leirens.jpg|150px|thumb|right|''Suzanne Lilar by Charles Leirens, signed, 1950's'']]
In 1919 Lilar attended the [[State University of Ghent]] where she studied [[philosophy]] and was the first woman to receive a [[Law degree]] in 1925.  During her studies she attended a seminar on [[Hadewych]].  Her interest in the 13th century [[poet]] and [[mysticism|mystic]] would play an important role in her later [[essays]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[novels]].  Lilar's historico-cultural insight, her analysis of [[consciousness]] and [[emotion]], her search for [[beauty]] and [[love]] are at the same time current and timeless.

==Literary career==
Applying a strong intellect to her work through precise language, she was a thoroughly modern writer and [[feminist]] who nonetheless remained highly versed in many areas of traditional [[western thought]] ([[Encyclopædia Britannica]]).  In 1956 Lilar succeeds Gustave Van Zype as member of the Royal Academy of French Language and Literature.  Her oeuvre has been translated in numerous languages.

==Early work==
Lilar began her literary career as a [[journalist]], reporting on [[Republican Spain]] for the newspaper ''L'Indépendance belge'' in 1931.  She later became a [[playwright]] with ''Le Burlador'' (1946), an original  reinterpretation of the [[Mythology|myth]] of [[Don Juan]] from the [[female]] perspective that revealed a profound capacity for [[psychological]] analysis.  She wrote two more [[Play (theatre)|plays]], ''Tous les chemins mènent au ciel'' (1947), a [[theological]] drama set in a 14th-century [[convent]], and ''Le Roi lépreux'' (1951), a neo-Pirandellian play about the [[Crusades]].

==Critical essays==
Her earliest [[essays]] are on the subject of the [[theatre]]. ''Soixante ans de théâtre belge'' (1952), originally published in [[New York City]] in 1950 as ''The Belgian Theater since 1890'', emphasizes the importance of a [[Flanders|Flemish]] tradition.  She followed this with ''Journal de l'analogiste'' (1954), in which the origin of the experience of  beauty and poetry was guided by a path of [[analogies]].  A short essay ''Théâtre et mythomanie'' was published in 1958.  [[Transcendence (philosophy)|Transcendence]] and [[metamorphosis]] are central to her seminal work ''Le Couple'' (1963), translated in 1965 by [[Jonathan Griffin]] as ''Aspects of Love in Western Society.''  In writings on [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], the [[Androgyne]] or [[homosexuality]] in [[Ancient Greece]], Lilar meditates on the role of the woman in [[Marriage|conjugal]] [[love]] throughout the ages.  Translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in 1976, it includes an [[afterword]] by [[Marnix Gijsen]].  In the same vein she later wrote critical essays on [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (''À propos de Sartre et de l'amour'', 1967) and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (''Le Malentendu du Deuxième Sexe'', 1969).

==Autobiographical works, novels==
Lilar wrote two [[autobiographical]] books, ''Une Enfance gantoise'' (1976) and ''À la recherche d'une enfance'' (1979), and two [[novels]], both of which date from 1960, ''Le Divertissement portugais'' and ''La Confession anonyme'', a [[neoplatonic]] idealization of love filtered through personal experience.  The Belgian director [[André Delvaux]] recreated this novel on film as ''[[Benvenuta (film)|Benvenuta]]'' in 1983, transposed as an intense examination of a tortured but exalted relationship between a young Belgian woman and her Italian lover. ''Les Moments merveilleux'' and ''Journal en partie double, I &amp; II'' were published as part of  ''Cahiers Suzanne Lilar'' (1986).

== Allegiance and caliphate (Khilafat) ==  
After completion of the intellectual and spiritual knowledge, his father granted him the caliphate (khilafat) and permission but he did not prepare to make Murid (spiritual disciple) to anyone. Even that his father Peer Meher Ali Shah said, “Who will make the disciple on his hand, then I am responsible for him.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mehr-e-Muneer|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hazrat Shah Ghulam Mohiuddin Al-Maroof Babu Ji رحمۃ اللہ تعالٰی علیہ  © Zia-e-Taiba|url=https://www.ziaetaiba.com/en/scholar/peer-syed-ghulam-mohiuddin-golra-sharif}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Syed Ghulam Mohiyyuddin Gilani, Babuji Golra Sharif coming out of train.jpg|thumb|Ghulam Mohiyyuddin at [[Rawalpindi]] Railway Station]]

== The concept of Wahdat ul Wajood (Ultimate Unity of Being) ==
Following the example of his father, Ghulam Mohiyuddin was a firm adherent to the concept of [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn Arabi's]] ideology of "Wahdat-ul-Wajood" (Ultimate Unity of Being). According to him, the Divine Will is at work behind all that is happening in the universe. The Divine Will which is absolute and everlasting manifests itself in the diverse aspects of this universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wahdat-ul-Wajood and Hazrat Babuji|url=http://www.thelightofgolrasharif.com/Website/TheLightofGolraSharif/babuji/WahdatUlWajood_and_Babuji.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in Pakistan movement ==
Syed Ghulam Mohiyyuddin played an important part in the Pakistan Movement.  When some of the people threatened to kill non-Muslim families residing in Golra Sharif, he intervened on the non-Muslims' behalf, provided them with security and later on accompanied them to the Indian border when they were leaving Pakistan for India. He extended a helping hand to even those families wishing to cross the border and live in India. He would take piles of clothing and dry rations to supply to those who were arriving in a state of deplorable misery. As reported by a large number of non-Muslims refugees here and across the border, they were deported to their places with great security and he paid special attention to their protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Role in Pakistan Movement|url=http://www.thelightofgolrasharif.com/Website/TheLightofGolraSharif/babuji/role_in_pakistan_movement.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1965 War==
When the 1965 India-Pakistan war started, Babuji addressed the people of Pakistan via Radio Pakistan. In his speech he exhorted them to make all efforts and sacrifices for the defence of their homeland. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Babuji Radio Pakistan speech |url=https://www.thvideos.net/video/IRq4DUBUOZg/voice-of-pir-syed.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Ghulam Mohiyuddin died on 22 June 1974 after prolonged illness and was buried next to his father in Golra Sharif.

'''Takamaro Shigaraki''' ({{lang|ja|信楽 峻麿}}, 1926 – 26 September 2014) was a Japanese [[Buddhist]] [[philosopher]]. Shigaraki is widely regarded as one of the most influential Buddhologists of the [[Jōdo Shinshū]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical data from the introduction by [[Volker Zotz]] to Takamaro Shigaraki: ''Sogar der Gute wird erlöst, um wie viel mehr der Böse. Der Weg des buddhistischen Meisters Shinran.'' Luxembourg 2004 ({{ISBN|2-9599829-2-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Shigaraki was born in Hiroshima in 1926. The former president of [[Ryukoku University]] spent his career studying [[Pure Land Buddhism]]. He was on the faculty of Ryukoku University, Kyoto, Japan, since 1958. He tried to clarify a contemporary meaning of Buddhism through looking into [[Shinran|Shinran’s]] thought from a perspective of [[existentialism]]. Shigaraki has been influenced by [[Paul Tillich]].

He died of chronic respiratory failure, on 26 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://getnews.jp/archives/673559 getnews.jp retrieved 28th Sept 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7648">'''The Bridge to Freedom''', an [[Ascended Master Teachings]] [[religion]], was established in 1951 by [[Geraldine Innocente]] and other students of the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]], after she received what was believed to be an "anointing" to become a "messenger" for the [[Great White Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' Book 1 1952. Reprinted: Mount Shasta, California: The Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 1989&lt;/ref&gt; This organization believed that their teachings had been given to humanity by the Ascended Masters. These were believed to be individuals who had lived in physical bodies, acquired the wisdom and mastery needed to become immortal and free of the cycles of "re-embodiment" and karma, attaining in this way their "[[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ascension]]". They considered the "ascension" to be the complete, permanent union of the purified outer self with the "I AM" Presence—meaning that true identity that is the unique individualization of God for each person.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The Magic Presence''. Saint Germain Press 1935. page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==

The members of The Bridge to Freedom claim that a Dispensation and Sponsorship was given by the Ascended Masters for this ''[[Ascended Master Teachings|Ascended Master Activity]]'' to be an outer organization representing the "[[Great White Brotherhood|Great Brotherhood of Light]]", and a  continuation of previous efforts by the Ascended Masters to bring Illumination to mankind through [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Agni Yoga]], and the [["I AM" Activity]].&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'' Oxford University Press, USA 2004. Describes the Theosophical Society and religious organizations based on a belief in Ascended Masters, such as The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of The Bridge to Freedom believe that [[Morya (Theosophy)|Ascended Master El Morya]] contacted Geraldine Innocente in 1944 and asked her to make a certain application on a daily basis. The story is told that Morya returned one year later asking if she would consent to receive a series of Discourses from the [[Maha Chohan]]. Geraldine is said to have agreed, and she then underwent years of training in preparation for her role in the 1950s as a Messenger for the Ascended Masters, the Archangels, [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings|Cosmic Beings]], the Elohim, and Others of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]]. She served officially in the capacity of Messenger beginning with the inaugural [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Vesta]] Dictation on July 17, 1951, until her transition on June 21, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book I''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Summary of Ascended Master Teachings from 1934 - 1958 as released through The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom. A. D. K. Luk was the pseudonym of Alice Beulah (Schutz) Booras ( April 10, 1905 - Jan. 14, 1994 )&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bridge to Freedom claims that in 1952 the Ascended Master [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Saint Germain]] stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
" . . . It was never intended to start a 'new' Activity, but to broaden the field of  service of the present Activity, by engaging the competent and willing service of lifestreams not presently allowed full expression of their talents in 'widening the borders of the Father's Kingdom.' Many hundreds of thousands of souls have not been privileged to receive the Instruction brought forth in My Name, due to barriers of language, limitation in the production and distribution of illuminating literature and the unhappy 'excommunications' which resulted from misunderstanding of a human nature. . . . A way and means by which We might reach the consciousness of the people had to be devised. 'The Bridge' was the solution to this problem. Mrs. Ballard was informed prior to any other individual of the purpose for which The Bridge came forth and was courteously invited to allow Us the opportunity of supporting her work and performing through other well qualified individuals the task of reaching other lifestreams than those presently blessed by the knowledge of The "I AM" Activity. . . . The Sun cannot limit its shining to one beam, nor the Love of God to one human consciousness, no matter how well attuned it may have been to the Vibrations of the Masters. The souls of men are our concern, all men, of all colors, all countries, because from the Flame in their hearts will come the Illumination which will make this Dark Star a Flaming Sun of Freedom. . . . " &lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K. ''Law of Life and Teachings by Divine Beings - Volume I'' A. D. K. Luk Publications, 1978. pages 12 - 15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Purpose==

It is believed that in September 1952, the Master Morya explained (through Geraldine Innocente) the purpose of the founding of The Bridge to Freedom:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
" . . . The beloved Maha Chohan gave Me a limited Grant, saying that the response of the few whom I had chosen would determine whether I could continue such an association. With well justified trepidation, I endeavored to correspond with the most likely and promising of those who professed to love Us and Our Way. Their response made it possible for Me to continue this Endeavor. Now many good and fine lifestreams, like a golden chain, girdling the Earth, make it possible for Us to transmit the current Action of the Brothers around the planet and bless all life and stimulate all souls by this universal service. This is the purpose of The Bridge, The Bulletin, and this expanded service which is but a part of the one Plan, even as the foundation is laid and a beautiful Spiritual Edifice built thereon. Without the Hierarchy, the Earth would long ago have passed into oblivion, the electrons which compose it returned to the universe, and the souls depending upon it for existence snuffed out like candles before the wind. . . . " &lt;ref&gt;''The First Ray'' Reprinted: Mount Shasta, California: The Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 1986. pages 32 - 33&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4360">In [[philosophy]], '''truth by consensus''' is the process of taking statements to be true simply because people generally agree upon them.  [[Imre Lakatos]] characterizes it as a "watered down" form of provable [[truth]] propounded by some [[sociology of knowledge|sociologists of knowledge]], particularly [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Michael Polanyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophical Papers|author=[[Imre Lakatos]]|chapter=Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes|pages=8|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter-url=http://www.csun.edu/~vcsoc00i/classes/s680f11/Lakatos.pdf|isbn=978-0-521-28031-0|access-date=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Nigel Warburton]] argues that the truth by consensus process is not a reliable way of discovering truth.  That there is general agreement upon something does not make it actually true.&lt;br&gt;
There are two main reasons for this:&lt;ref name=Warburton&gt;{{cite book|title=Thinking from A to Z|author=Nigel Warburton|chapter=truth by consensus|pages=134&amp;ndash;135|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-22281-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# One reason Warburton discusses is that people are prone to wishful thinking.  People can believe an assertion and espouse it as truth in the face of overwhelming evidence and facts to the contrary, simply because they wish that things were so.  
# The other one is that people are gullible, and easily misled.

Another unreliable method of determining truth is by determining the majority opinion of a popular vote.  This is unreliable because on many questions the majority of people are ill-informed.  Warburton gives [[astrology]] as an example of this.  He states that while it may be the case that the majority of the people of the world believe that people's destinies are wholly determined by astrological mechanisms, given that most of that majority have only sketchy and superficial knowledge of the stars in the first place, their views cannot be held to be a significant factor in determining the truth of astrology.  The fact that something "is generally agreed" or that "most people believe" something should be viewed critically, asking the question why that factor is considered to matter at all in an argument over truth.  He states that the simple fact that a majority believes something to be true is unsatisfactory justification for believing it to be true.&lt;ref name=Warburton /&gt;

Warburton makes a distinction between the fallacy of truth by consensus and the process of [[democracy]] in decision-making.  Democracy is preferable to other processes not because it results in truth, but because it provides for equal participation by multiple special-interest groups, and the avoidance of [[tyranny]].&lt;ref name=Warburton /&gt;

Weinberger characterizes [[Jürgen Habermas]] as a proponent of a [[consensus theory of truth]], and criticizes that theory as unacceptable on the following grounds:  First, even if everyone's opinion is in agreement, those opinions may all nonetheless be erroneous.  Second, truth by consensus is conceived as a limit that is approached via an idealized process of discourse; however, it has not been proven that discourse even tends towards such a limit, or that discourse even tends towards ''one single'' limit, and thus it is not proven that truth is the limit that is approached by ideal discourse and consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alternative Action Theory: Simultaneously a Critique of Georg Henrik Von Wright's Practical Philosophy|author=Ota Weinberger|pages=63|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7923-5184-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7159">The '''Underhanded C Contest''' is a [[Computer programming|programming]] contest to turn out code that is malicious, but passes a rigorous inspection, and looks like an honest mistake even if discovered. The contest rules define a task, and a malicious component. Entries must perform the task in a malicious manner as defined by the contest, and hide the malice. Contestants are allowed to use [[C (programming language)|C]]-like compiled languages to make their programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.i-programmer.info/news/204/5727.html | title=Underhanded C Contest Revived | publisher=I Programmer | date=2013-04-06 | accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contest was organized by Dr. Scott Craver&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.binghamton.edu/watson/programs/academic-departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering/people/faculty-and-staff.html Faculty and Staff page of EE Dept. at Binghamton University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529234243/http://www2.binghamton.edu/watson/programs/academic-departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering/people/faculty-and-staff.html |date=May 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Department of Electrical Engineering at [[Binghamton University]] ([[New York State]]). The contest was initially inspired by Daniel Horn’s Obfuscated V contest in the fall of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.underhanded-c.org/_page_id_7.html | title=Underhanded C Contest FAQ | publisher=Underhanded C contest | accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For the 2005 to 2008 contests, the prize was a $100 gift certificate to [[ThinkGeek]]. The 2009 contest had its prize increased to $200 due to the very late announcement of winners, and the prize for the 2013 contest is also a $200 gift certificate.

The domain for the website has expired as of 2018-10-17.

==2005 Contest==
The 2005 contest had the task of basic image processing, such as resampling or smoothing, but covertly inserting unique and useful "fingerprinting" data into the image. Winning entries from 2005 used uninitialized data structures, reuse of pointers, and an embedding of [[machine code]] in constants.

==2006 Contest==
The 2006 contest required entries to count word occurrences, but have vastly different runtimes on different platforms. To accomplish the task, entries used fork implementation errors, optimization problems, [[endianness|endian]] differences and various API implementation differences. The winner called strlen() in a loop, leading to quadratic complexity which was optimised out by a Linux compiler but not by Windows.

==2007 Contest==
The 2007 contest required entries to encrypt and decrypt files with a strong, readily available encryption algorithm such that a low percentage (1% - 0.01%) of the encrypted files may be cracked in a reasonably short time. The contest commenced on April 16 and ended on July 4.  Entries used misimplementations of RC4, misused API calls, and incorrect function prototypes.

==2008 Contest==
The 2008 contest required entries to redact a rectangular portion of a [[Netpbm format|PPM]] image in a way that the portion may be reconstructed. Any method of "blocking out" the rectangle was allowed, as long as the original pixels were removed, and the pixel reconstruction didn't have to be perfect&lt;ref&gt;[http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=8 2008 contest rules] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322223931/http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=8 |date=March 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (although the reconstruction's fidelity to the original file would be a factor in judging).  The contest began on June 12, and ended on September 30.  Entries tended to either xor the region with a retrievable pseudo-random mask or append the masked data to the end of the file format.  The two placing programs both used improperly defined macros while the winner, choosing to work with an uncommon text based format, zeroed out pixel values while keeping the number of digits intact.

==2009 Contest==
The 2009 contest required participants to write a program that sifts through routing directives but redirects a piece of luggage based on some innocuous-looking comment in the space-delimited input data file. The contest began December 29, 2009, and was due to end on March 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718125443/http://xcott.com/ The Underhanded C Contest »&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], [http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=18 xcott.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085335/http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=18 |date=October 6, 2014 }} (archived from [http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=18 the original]  on 2011-07-18)&lt;/ref&gt; However, no activity occurred for three years. The winners were only announced on April 1, 2013, with one overall winner and six runners-up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100108082655/http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=19 The Underhanded C Contest » Also, we’re looking for good PhD students&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130409231352/http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~scraver/underhanded/ The Underhanded C Contest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 Contest==
The 2013 contest was announced on April 1, 2013, and was due July 4, 2013; results were announced on September 29, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underhanded-c.org/_p_23.html|title=2013 Winners|author=Scott Craver|date=2014-09-29|accessdate=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was about a fictional social website called "ObsessBook". The challenge was to write a function to compute the DERPCON (Degrees of Edge-Reachable Personal CONnection) between two users that "accidentally" computes a too low distance for a special user.

==2014 Contest==
The 2014 contest was announced on November 2, 2014, and was due January 1, 2015.  The results were announced on June 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underhanded-c.org/_p_26.html|title=The 7th Underhanded C Contest is now Open|author=Scott Craver|date=2014-11-02|accessdate=2014-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object was to write surveillance code for a Twitter-like social networking service, to comply with a secret government surveillance request; but for non-obvious reasons, the code must subtly leak the act of surveillance to a user.

==2015 Contest==
The 2015 contest was announced on August 15, 2015, and was due November 15, 2015.  The results were announced on January 15, 2016. The scenario was a nuclear disarmament process between the Peoples Glorious Democratic Republic of Alice and the Glorious Democratic Peoples Republic of Bob, and the mission was to write a test function for comparing potentially fissile material against a reference sample, which under certain circumstances would label a warhead as containing fissile material when it doesn't.

The '''Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief''' was established in 1986 by the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].

== Background ==
The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief]] in 1981. Although not endowed with the force of [[international law]], this resolution was the first international legal instrument devoted exclusively to the [[freedom of religion]].

In furtherance of the goals of the 1981 resolution and in support the general evolution of the freedom of religion as a [[human rights|human right]], the United Nations Commission on Human Rights established the [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs|"Special Rapporteur on Religion Intolerance]]." In 2000 the Commission on Human Rights changed the mandate title of the position to "Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief", in order that the position's name may more accurately capture the need for the Special Rapporteur to protect individuals's right to change religion or abstain from religious belief.

== Independent Experts ==
The Independent Expert is appointed by the [[UN Human Rights Council]]. The mandate holder has been invited to identify existing and emerging obstacles to the free exercise of the right to freedom of religion or belief, and present recommendations on methods by which such obstacles may be overcome.

Past Independent Experts:
*Angelo d'Almeida Ribeiro (Portugal), March 1986 -1993
*Abdelfattah Amor (Tunisia), April 1993 - July 2004
*[[Asma Jahangir]] (Pakistan), August 2004 - July 2010
*[[Heiner Bielefeldt]] (Germany), 1 August 2010 – November 2016

Current Independent Expert:
*[[Ahmed Shaheed]] (Maldives), 1 November 2016 – Present

The values that a person holds may be personal or political depending on whether they are considered in relation to the individual or to society.&lt;ref&gt;Mason E. ''Value Pluralism'', 2006 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2018); ''cf''. Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.7ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from moral virtue, examples of personal values include friendship, knowledge, beauty etc. and examples of political values, justice, equality and liberty. This article will outline some current ideas relating to the first group - personal values. It will begin by looking at the kinds of thing that have value and finish with a look at some of the theories that attempt to describe what value is.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman M.J. ''Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Value'', 2002 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;  Reference will be made solely to Western sources although it is recognised that many, if not all, of the values discussed may be universal.

==Introduction==

It is only in the last hundred years or so that the subject of value has become a subject of study in its own right. A new field of enquiry called “[[axiology]]” (from the Greek ''axios'' meaning “worth”), defined as “the philosophical study of goodness or value”, began to emerge at around the beginning of the twentieth century, and its significance lay in extending the scope of the term “value” into fields other than traditional [[Value (ethics)|ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Ex.Brit. s.v. ''Axiology''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hermann Lotze|R.H.Lotze]], [[Franz Brentano|F.Brentano]] and [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] have been cited as early proponents of the subject, and to Moore is attributed the important distinction made between [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|intrinsic and instrumental value]], that is, between things that have value in themselves and things that might lead to something of value.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt; 

Examples of recent articles which introduce the subject include Mark Schroeder’s ''Value Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder M. ''Value Theory'', 2008 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;  Elinor Mason’s ''Value Pluralism''&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  and Michael Zimmerman’s ''Intrinsic and Extrinsic Value''.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt; Schroeder defines axiology as being “primarily concerned with classifying what things are good”, and, in accepting that there might be a number of things that can be valued or called good, he asks is there, underlying these, just one or is there more than one fundamental intrinsic value. Mason outlines two ways in which values have been considered in relation to one another: the first is called “[[Monism|monist]]”, which maintains that there is just one intrinsic value to which all other values are auxiliary; and the second is called “[[Value pluralism|pluralist]]”, which maintains that there are many kinds of value and that the most important of these are irreducible to one another. Typical of the first school were the [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarians]], such as [[Jeremy Bentham]], who thought that all the values that a person might hold could be reduced to a desire for happiness or pleasure. [[Immanuel Kant]], too, has been described as a monist in saying that the only good in itself lies in possessing a good will.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. Kant.I ''Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 1785, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding those holding pluralist views, Zimmerman in his book ''The Nature of Intrinsic Value'' (2012) gives some examples of more recent philosophers with lists of the kinds of thing that they thought had value:&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman M.J. ''The Nature of Intrinsic Value'' (Rowman and Littlefield, Lanham, 2001) p.189&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] (1889): Pleasure, Happiness, Love, Knowledge, Beauty, Proportion, Intention, Exercise, Virtue&lt;ref&gt;Brentano F. ''The Origin of our Knowledge of Right and Wrong'', 1889 (Routledge and Keegan Paul, London, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[G. E. Moore|Moore]] (1908) - Aesthetics, Affection, Knowledge, Consciousness, Pleasure, Virtue&lt;ref&gt;Moore G.E. ''Principia Ethica'' (Cambridge University Press, 1903) pp.122 &amp; ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. D. Ross|Ross]] (1936) - Virtue, Pleasure, Knowledge, Artistic activity&lt;ref&gt;Ross W.D. ''The Right and the Good'' (Oxford University Press, 1930)&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Zimmerman singles out the work of [[William Frankena]] who, in his book ''Ethics'' (1963), gave a comprehensive list of values and who, besides suggesting the use of headings, began to group similar values together.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena W.K. ''Ethics'', 1963 (Prentice-Hall, Eaglewood Cliffs, 1973) pp.87-88; cf. Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt; It will be useful to discuss these in the following groups:

1. Beauty, harmony, proportion, aesthetic experience

2. Moral disposition, virtue, pleasure, happiness, contentment

3. Truth, knowledge, understanding, wisdom, honour, esteem

4. Life, health, strength, peace, security

5. Love, affection, friendship, cooperation

6. Power, achievement, freedom, adventure, novelty

Frankena, in formulating his list, builds on what he called the “classical triad” of [[Transcendentals|beauty, goodness and truth]]&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. O’Hear A. ''Philosophy: The Good, the True and the Beautiful'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010) ''cf''. Perry ''Op.cit''.49, pp.93-97, 693&lt;/ref&gt; and headings similar to these terms can be used to introduce a primary set of values as follows.

==Primary Values==

===Aesthetic values===

[[William Frankena|Frankena]] in his list of values groups beauty with harmony, proportion and aesthetic experience. There are many different kinds of value that can be included in this category and Frankena himself distinguishes between “harmony and proportion in objects contemplated” and “harmony and proportion in one’s own life”.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit.13'', p.88&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to [[Plato]] who, firstly, in the ''[[Philebus]]'' suggests that aesthetic pleasure lies in the “beauty of colour and form”, and secondly in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' that formal features like harmony and proportion are important not only to art and music but also to the “good life” which itself should contain “form”, “variety” and “balance”.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit.13'', p.92; cf. Plato ''The Republic'' (ed. Ferrari G., tr. Griffith T., Cambridge University Press, 2000) pp.88-92; cf Plato ''Philebus'' 51&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another distinction results from the question of whether aesthetic value resides in the object contemplated or in the contemplative experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley M.C. ''Aesthetics from Classical Greece to the Present'', 1966 (University of Alabama Press, 1975) pp.101-102 &amp; ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; James Shelley in his article ''The Concept of the Aesthetic'' notes that the term "aesthetic" in deriving from the Greek ''aesthesis'', which means perception or awareness, tends towards the latter interpretation;&lt;ref&gt;Shelley J. ''The Concept of the Aesthetic'', 2009 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] in his book ''Art and the Aesthetic'' charts the development of awareness and consciousness in their growing importance to aesthetic theory;&lt;ref&gt;Dickie G. ''Art and the Aesthetic: An Intuitional Analysis'' (Cornell University Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and Zimmerman refers to [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] who wrote in relation to art and beauty that “by far the most valuable thing we know or can imagine are certain states of consciousness”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf. Moore''Op.cit''.11, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[William Frankena|Frankena]] and [[Nicolai Hartmann]], who Frankena mentions, begin their lists of values with groups including consciousness, life and existence, and Hartmann makes reference to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] who considered that the value of beauty in art or nature lay in an increased awareness of life as an “affirmation of existence”.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann N. ''Ethics'': Part II, ''The Realm of Ethical Values'' or ''Axiology of Morals'', 1926 (George Allen and Unwin, London, 1951) Chs. 11&amp;12; cf. Nietzsche F. ''The Birth of Tragedy'' pp.263,290&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelley describes another concept apart from “immediacy” or “focussing one’s attention on the subject” and this is the concept of “disinterestedness", a Kantian term which consists in looking at things objectively and impartially.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. ''The Critique of Judgement'' (tr. Meredith J.C. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] who realised that if perception were to be the only criterion of aesthetic value then, with a mind stripped of practical interest and cultural preconceptions, anything at all might be seen as beautiful: “One thing is only taken as more beautiful than another because it makes this pure contemplation easier”, wrote Schopenhauer,&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''The World as Will and Representation'' (tr. Payne E. Dover Publications, New York, 1966) pp.271-272&lt;/ref&gt; a view criticised by Sartwell for making the term beauty, ultimately meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Sartwell C. ''Beauty'', 2012 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley, however, manages to elucidate various criteria of aesthetic value from such a standpoint: firstly, that there is value in simple formal relations, in harmony, grace and balance, and in fact in any other objective aspect that a good critic might care to point to; secondly, that there is value in recognising that people have natural tastes and preferences, whether, for example, they prefer “drama or comicality”, or whether the work is striking in some way; and thirdly, that there is value in recognising the presence of “non-exhibited properties”, realising that the work, or perception, is located within an “art-historical context” where only knowledge of, in [[Arthur Danto|Danto’s]] terminology, an “artworld” can facilitate our feeling “the proper sentiments”.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley ''Op.cit''.18; cf. Dickie ''Op.cit.''19&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the views that aesthetic value lies either in the object or in the subjective experience there is a third view which suggests that value lies in some kind of engagement between the two. [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]]  wrote that it is neither in the “beautiful object” nor in the “conscious perception” where value is found but in the relationship between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit''.11 pp.18,59,122&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley too concludes with the idea that there is some reciprocal relationship between subject and object, his example being that of a Bartok quartet, where “a value originally belonging to the quartet has been transferred to the experience, before being reflected back, once again, onto the quartet.”&lt;ref&gt;Shelley ''Op.cit''.18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical values===

The second group of values listed by Frankena includes happiness, virtue, pleasure, satisfaction and contentment - values traditionally associated with the field of [[Value (ethics)|ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman introduces Plato whose recurring concern was with the nature of the good, how we should live our lives, and whether it is [[pleasure]] or [[virtue]] that will lead to [[happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.9, p.114; cf. Plato ''Op.cit''.16, pp.37,51&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding pleasure, he considers food, drink and shelter to be simple [[goods]] – people value them, they value the work that goes into providing them and the pleasure that comes from enjoying them. Zimmerman after asking why eating should be considered a value refers to [[Aristotle]] who said that value resides in “the proper activity or functioning of things according to their nature” and that it is the “active exercising of man’s faculties that give rise to pleasure”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf. Aristotle ''Nicomachean Ethics'' (tr. Thomson J., Penguin, Harmondsworth, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding [[virtue]], Elinor Mason refers to [[John Stuart Mill|J.S.Mill]] who made the distinction between lower values and higher values.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinction is that between efficient cause and final cause: whereas efficient cause includes hunger, thirst and the need for shelter, final cause arises from our having an overview of the relation of [[Causality|cause and effect]] whereby we can determine the end we want to achieve and then decide the means to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.86; cf. Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 982b-983a&lt;/ref&gt;  If the end is well-being or happiness then such values as friendship, knowledge and beauty, as well as material sustenance, might be instrumental in achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Mason refers to [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] who, whilst recognising the virtues of “industry and temperance”, recognised that there exists a “plurality of bearers of value”. [[Love]], [[beauty]] and [[friendship]] are intrinsic values (i.e. good in themselves) rather than instrumental values, and they do not lead in all cases necessarily either to [[pleasure]] or [[happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit.''11&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another significant writer on value, mentioned by both [[William Frankena|Frankena]] and Zimmerman, is [[John Dewey]] who questioned whether intrinsic values exist at all. All values for Dewey were instrumental. He compared life to an “ongoing stream” of cause and effect, which he called the “continuum of means and ends”,&lt;ref&gt;Dewey J. ''Theory of Valuation'', 1923, in ''International Encyclopaedia of Unified Sciences'' Vol II (University of Chicago Press, 1939) p.43; cf. Anderson ''Op.cit''.140&lt;/ref&gt;  where for example a lack of food leads to human activity leading to a further expenditure of energy, the need for more food and so on. He maintained, like [[Aristotle]], that value lay in economy and in the efficient functioning of a human being in terms of a whole range of needs and wants.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. pp.15-18, 50&lt;/ref&gt;  These needs arise from a constant “interaction between a human being and his environment” and Dewey introduced the notion of having a “framework” of values to deal effectively with the various categories of being which contribute to our environment.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural values===

The third of the classical values - [[truth]] – is listed by [[William Frankena|Frankena]] alongside [[knowledge]], understanding and [[wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that “truth may never be fully known” he shifted the emphasis onto knowledge, and most lists of values now tend to include knowledge rather than truth as one of the primary values. [[Jesse Prinz]] in ''[[Culture]] and [[Cognitive Science]]'' took this further discussing the relativity of the terms knowledge and truth and the role that culture has in shaping knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Prinz J. ''Culture and Cognitive Science'', 2011 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  This relativity is more pronounced in a second group listed by Frankena, a group which included the values of [[honour]], esteem and good reputation. The link between the two groups was noted by [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]] who realised that the terms “truth” and “truthfulness” involved two different, although related, kinds of value.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.17, Sec.6&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst [[truth]] is associated with the values of [[knowledge]] and understanding, truthfulness is associated with the values of honesty, uprightness and [[integrity]].

In his article, [[Jesse Prinz|Prinz]] defines [[culture]] as a complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morality and custom where the value associated with these things is acquired by people as members of society. This acquisition takes place through observing role models, imitating one’s parents or learning through association with others. The telling of stories is mentioned&lt;ref&gt;Prinz ''Op.cit''.39&lt;/ref&gt;  and we may think of the value of books, whether fiction or non-fiction, and the worth of films or news programmes in disseminating knowledge and furthering understanding generally. Memory too has its place,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; ''cf''. Ruskin J. ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'' (George Allen, London, 1880) pp.177ff&lt;/ref&gt;  and the importance of history in this respect is highlighted by Zimmerman who notes that some things may have value, not because they are beautiful or useful, but because they have meaning through either personal or cultural associations, for example a rare stamp or the pen with which Lincoln signed his letters.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

Knowledge of both [[culture]] and [[subculture]] is important in understanding people’s values.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey ''Op.cit''.35, pp.58-64&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacobson in an article on fitting [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] tells us that what people find funny or shameful, honourable or dishonourable are culturally related, and he refers back to [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] who introduced the related value of what is appropriate, suitable or fitting.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson D. ''Fitting Attitude Theories of Value'', 2011 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  Such values, however, can be considered not only from the point of view of a particular culture but from “the point of view of the universe” where integrating one’s set of values with the principles of some higher truth (“selective copying” is the example he gives) may result in instances of non-conformity and other kinds of differentiation within society.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of “fittingness” introduces the value of [[integrity]] which Cox, La Caze and Levine discuss in their article ''Integrity'' [2001].&lt;ref&gt;Cox D., La Caze M. &amp; Levine M. ''Integrity'', 2001 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is defined in terms of the relation between the different aspects of one’s life – aesthetic, social, intellectual etc. – and in maintaining some sort of balance between them to give a sense of unity or wholeness. Views on integrity range from the practical requirements of honesty and truthfulness on the one hand, where [[Aristotle]] could write “with a true view all the data harmonise and with a false view the facts soon clash”,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Op.cit''.30, 1098b&lt;/ref&gt;  to more general approaches regarding meaning and [[Personal identity|identity]], or “wisdom and [[Self-concept|self-knowledge]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, La Caze &amp; Levine ''Op.cit''.47&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Secondary Values==

The end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries saw an expansion in the number of values over and above the “classical” or primary values of beauty, goodness and truth. Some, like love, friendship and affection, clearly come from the Christian tradition and were discussed by philosophers like [[G. E. Moore|Moore]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit.'' 13, pp.56-59; ''cf''. Moore ''Op.cit''.11 pp.131-132&lt;/ref&gt;  A more complex group revolving around concepts such as power, spirit and the will were introduced as values by Brentano and [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]] and owe as much to the thoughts of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] as they do to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm R. ''Brentano and Intrinsic Value'' (Cambridge University Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  The emergence of a third group of values can be seen as a result of the expansion of the field away from traditional ethics, and in this group there begin to appear more material values – what [[Plato]] called the “goods of the body” – such as life, health and strength in the lists of Hartmann and Frankena.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.17; cf. Plato ''Op.cit''.16 591b; cf Plato ''Meno'' 90ff&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some early attempts were made at compiling a longer set of values and three of these can be mentioned here. [[Ralph Barton Perry|R.B.Perry]], referred to by Frankena, and whose work ''The General Theory of Value'' [1926] was called “the magnum opus of the new approach” by the Encyclopaedia Britannica, increased the total number of categories by adding to the fields of aesthetics, ethics and knowledge the three further fields of religion, economics and politics;&lt;ref&gt;Perry R.B. ''General Theory of Value'' (Harvard University Press; 1926) pp.693-694&lt;/ref&gt;  An earlier work, ''Lebensformen'' [1914], by the psychologist, [[Eduard Spranger]], set out a similar list describing six types of personality, namely the Aesthetic, Economic, Theoretic, Religious, Social and Political;&lt;ref&gt;Spranger E. ''Types of Men'', 1914 (tr. Pigors P., Max Niemeyer Verlag, Halle, 1928)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gordon Allport]], who studied under Spranger, and who was mentioned in [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman|Seligman’s]] ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues]]'' [2004]&lt;ref&gt;Miller C.B. ''Empirical Approaches to Moral Character'', 2016 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2016); ''cf''. Peterson C. &amp; Seligman M. ''Character Strengths and Virtues'' (Oxford University Press, New York, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; , together with Vernon and Lindzey, set out in their ''Study of Values'' [1950] six types of personality each of which was orientated towards a different set of values:&lt;ref&gt;Allport G., Vernon P.E. &amp; Lindzey G.E. ''Study of Values'' (Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

These early links between philosophy and psychology have been discussed recently by C.B.Miller in his article entitled ''Empirical Approaches to Moral Character'' and this concluded with a look at the work of Peterson and Seligman.&lt;ref&gt;Miller ''Op.cit''.55&lt;/ref&gt;  Their classification of values, "[[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|Values in Action]]" or VIA, arose from an empirical survey of virtues taken from around the world, which led to a six-fold classification, similar to the above, and comprising: Transcendence, Temperance, Wisdom, Justice, Humanity and Courage.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson and Seligman ''Op.cit'' 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Miller suggested, however, that no valid reason has been discovered as to why there should be six categories.

Regarding the content of these additional categories it is clear that their representative values differ according to who is compiling the list. One theory suggests that if the first three categories represent the cognitive or classical tradition, then the additional categories represent the non-cognitive - the “sentimental” or “emotivist” tradition - where neither the cognitive nor the non-cognitive necessarily takes primacy.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit.'' 2; Jacobson ''Op.cit''. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman suggested that values taken from the latter viewpoint could be seen as just expressions of feeling or emotion about what is important.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  A.M.Taylor in her paper, ''Investigation into Facts and Values'' [1983], suggested that there was a fundamental difference between values based on analytical understanding and values based on synthetic or “wholistic” understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor A-M (née Cushan) ''Investigation into Facts and Values'', 1983 (Ondwell Publications, Victoria, Australia, 2014) pp.9, 14-16&lt;/ref&gt;  The older values taken from the “aesthetic, moral and scientific spheres” were not enough and new categories would be required to include such concepts as “creativity, feeling and innovation”. Jacobson also introduced a distinction between cognitive and non-cognitive values, and among the values derived from feeling or sentiment he included those of being “pride-worthy, shameful, funny and fearsome”.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit''.45&lt;/ref&gt;  He mentioned [[David Hume]] in this respect who had used the three headings of “Pride and Humility”, “Love and Hatred” and “Will and the Direct Passions” in the second volume of his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature|Treatise of Human Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hume D. A ''Treatise of Human Nature'' (ed. Selby-Bigge L.A., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  and it will be useful to look at the second group of values in this order.

===Material Values===

[[William Frankena|Frankena’s]] list of values begins with a group that contains life, health and strength and in this he closely follows [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  “Material goods” were discussed by Hartmann in the introductory section of his book,''The Realm of Ethical Values'' [1926] in relation to wealth and economics.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21&lt;/ref&gt;  Frankena mentions [[Plato]] who had referred to wealth, health and strength as “goods of the body”.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Op.cit''.16&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding wealth, Frankena, in a discussion of “money, cars and other material possessions”, suggested that its value might be either instrumental or contributory, the latter term being defined in terms of “things that are good because they contribute to a good life or are parts of it”.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.62,81&lt;/ref&gt;  Money for a miser becomes part of his happiness, just as clothes, house or land may be a part of happiness for somebody else. Jacobson introduced the value of being “pride-worthy” and he mentioned [[David Hume]] who had noted that people take pride in, such “external advantages as… country, family, children, gardens, houses, dogs and clothes”.&lt;ref&gt;Hume ''Op.cit''.63, p.545&lt;/ref&gt;  Elinor Mason mentioned the practical wisdom of [[Aristotle]] who saw wealth as a matter of prudence, and who advised people to value and “not to neglect” what belongs to them.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Op.cit''.30, 1120b&lt;/ref&gt; 

Health on the other hand, in relation to the body and the mind, is usually thought of as an intrinsic value. [[William Frankena|Frankena]], for example, wrote that we desire health “for its own sake”,&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.82,87&lt;/ref&gt;  and Zimmerman wrote that “Being healthy is just a good way to be”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt;  The value that we ascribe to life itself and the value of “just being” have been mentioned previously, but it was Hartmann who reintroduced the notion from earlier German philosophy that Being has a complementary category, namely that of [[Becoming (philosophy)|Becoming]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21; cf. Schopenhauer ''Op.cit''.23&lt;/ref&gt;  Everything is subject to change over time, and without human intervention, is subject to deterioration and decay. In relation to this, Mason referred to [[Immanuel Kant]] one of whose principal values lay in [[duty]], particularly, in this respect, duty to self, and looking after the “basic stuff” through physical exercise and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I ''The Metaphysics of Morals'', 1797 (tr. Gregor M., Cambridge University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato had also thought that the right way of living lay in “medicine, bathing and exercise”&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Op.cit''.16&lt;/ref&gt;  but Kant added to this idea by saying that value also lay in self-improvement through the cultivation of any “natural talents and gifts of fortune” that a person might possess.&lt;ref&gt;Kant ''Op.cit''.73&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James Griffin (philosopher)|James Griffin]] in his book on ''[[Well-being|Well-Being]]'' [1986] similarly introduced the value of “accomplishment” and how, in Aristotle’s terminology, we might grow and “[[Flourishing|flourish]]” in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin J. ''Well-Being: Its Meaning, Measurement and Moral Importance'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1986) pp.35,57&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Communal Values===

To the classical triad of beauty, goodness and truth various philosophers in the twentieth century began to add values from another large family: that of, in [[William Frankena|Frankena's]] words, “[[love]], [[friendship]], mutual affection and cooperation”;&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.42,88&lt;/ref&gt; [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] added “love” to the values of beauty, moral quality and knowledge;&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit''.11, pp.122-123; cf. Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.9, p.189&lt;/ref&gt; and Jacobson added “friendship” to the values of beauty, pleasure and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit''.45 “Consider a plausible list of intrinsic values: pleasure, beauty, friendship, knowledge…”&lt;/ref&gt;  Moore, in reflecting Christianity’s emphasis on the importance of [[Agape|love]], suggested that “… the love of love is by far the most valuable good we know… more complicated than beauty… more complicated than knowledge”.&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit''.11, p.132&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Frankena and Zimmerman mentioned [[Plato]], who had outlined various kinds of [[love]] in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Symposium'' 197&lt;/ref&gt;  and who had described ''sympatheia'' or coaffection , as “filling men with affection… kindness… friendship… forgiveness”.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Op.cit''.16, 605d&lt;/ref&gt;  For Plato, the soul was the seat of love and the affections, and its value lay in recognising the “community of feeling among mankind”.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Timaeus'' 192b; Plato ''Gorgias'' 481&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacobson referred to [[David Hume]] who similarly linked love with [[sympathy]], the  latter feeling arising from “the great resemblance among human creatures”.&lt;ref&gt;Hume ''Op.cit.''63, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; 

On a more practical level, [[Bernard Gert]] in his work on ''The Definition of Morality'' [2002] introduced the notion of “[[loyalty]]” as a factor in establishing a sense of [[community]] among family and kinship groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gert B. &amp; Gert J. ''The Definition of Morality'', 2002 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding wider society, Gert mentioned [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] who distinguished between the values of not harming other people on the one hand and performing positive, charitable acts on the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman also mentioned Kant and his view that the only thing that is good without qualification is goodwill or benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant had defined [[friendship]] as “the coming together of two persons through mutual love, each particating and sharing their lives in a sympathetic manner”.&lt;ref&gt;Kant ''Op.cit''.73, 6.450, 6.469&lt;/ref&gt;  He also introduced the concept of “[[respect]]” by which he meant keeping an appropriate distance from others within the community,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. 6.449&lt;/ref&gt;  and he talked of [[community]] itself in terms of “being able to communicate… to perfect social intercourse… and to cultivate a disposition of… reciprocity… agreeableness… courtesy… hospitality”.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.6.473&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Communication]] was introduced as a separate value by [[Ralph Barton Perry|Perry]];&lt;ref&gt;Perry ''Op.cit''.53, pp.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]], after working through the primary values, introduced a “second group” which included not only “brotherly love” but also “social intercourse”.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21&lt;/ref&gt;  Frankena introduced [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] who had stressed the value of communication in human relationships saying that “there are close parallels between the communication of words and that between lover and beloved”.&lt;ref&gt;Gilby T. ''St Thomas Aquinas: Theological Texts'' (Oxford University Press) pp.181ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Gert too realised that there was value in “interpersonal interaction” but queried how such a value could apply in the absence of other people, for example, on a desert island.&lt;ref&gt;Gert &amp; Gert ''Op.cit''.85&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Frankena|Frankena]] answered the question by widening the scope of love to include love of, or communion with, God, animals, nature and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13 p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual Values===

Towards the end of his list, [[William Frankena|Frankena]] included the values of power and achievement, freedom, adventure and novelty.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding freedom, he introduced [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] who saw life as a continuous engagement with the realm of strife, a struggle against desire and the “[[Will (philosophy)|primal will]]”, where the only moments of freedom that a person may have lay in art, music and [[Spirituality|spiritual contemplation]].&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley ''Op.cit''.17, p.459; cf. Carrit E.F. ''The Theory of Beauty'' (Methuen &amp; Co, London, 1914) p.122&lt;/ref&gt;  Strength and freedom of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] were values for Hartmann too,&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21, Sec.3&lt;/ref&gt;  and also for [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] who, as Zimmerman noted, saw such freedom lying in the absence of coercion either from external agencies of from internal “sensuous impulses”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf.Kant I. ''Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 1785, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;  These latter included [[Emotion|emotions]] such as [[desire]], [[fear]], [[hope]] and [[anger]], whose value, or power, lay, according to Aristotle, in moving a person either towards or away from some perceived object.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''De Anima'' 408b; Similar feelings inform our attitudes, according to Brentano, which he termed either pro-attitudes or anti-attitudes accordingly, see Chisholm ''Op.cit.''51, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;  Griffin distinguished between desire itself and “informed desire”, where the value of the latter lay in stirring the mind, not involuntarily through emotion and natural inclination, but through the voluntary power of the will.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin ''Op.cit''.76; pp.26-27&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitudes]] can be controlled through strength of mind, courage and self-discipline, and “corrected”, according to [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]], through an informed choice about what is right, fitting or appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit''.45&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Frankena|Frankena]] recorded that his list included “all the things that [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]] mentions”,&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  but it is notable that Hartmann completed his list with what he called “spiritual goods” such as “love of the remote” and, in a [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschian]] phrase, “radiant virtue”.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21, Sec.7&lt;/ref&gt;  Love of the remote referred to either love of the wilderness or love of God, but Michael Stocker in ''Plural and Conflicting Values'' [1990]&lt;ref&gt;Stocker M. ''Plural and Conflicting Values'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  suggested that value lay more, as Plato had said, not in love but in the “[[contemplation]]” of God or of what is good: “He who proceeds aright”, said Plato, “should begin in youth to visit beautiful places… to contemplate the vast sea… until on that shore he grows and waxes strong”.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Symposium'' 210&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Jewish tradition it was not so much the sea that bestowed strength, but the hills,&lt;ref&gt;Psalms 121.1&lt;/ref&gt;  and Griffin referred to those who value mountains for the excitement or the [[sublimity]] that they might afford.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin ''Op.cit''.76, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;   Frankena referred to the values of adventure and novelty that [[Alfred North Whitehead|A.N.Whitehead]] had introduced,&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;  but it was [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] in the previous century who had written about the inspirational value of new things and of travel, not only for the sake of art or study, but for the value of the experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson R.W. ''Experience'' in ''Nature and Selected Essays'' (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]] suggested that it might be a great work of art such as a cathedral or a piece of music that might be inspiring,&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;  and he mentioned [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] who wrote regarding art: “What does all art do? Does it not select? Does it not highlight? By doing these art strengthens certain values… It is the great stimulus of life”.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche F. ''Twilight of the Idols'' (tr. Hollingdale R., Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1968) pp.81-82&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively it might be [[humour]] that lifts the spirits and Jacobson discusses the value that different kinds of humour, such as being funny or being amusing might merit.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit.''45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of Value==

Various theories have been put forward in the West to try and define what a value “is” – as opposed to saying what kinds of value a thing may “have”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt;  There are generally held to be three kinds of theory at present that attempt to answer the question of what a value is and these have been borrowed from the field of [[Normative ethics|ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1; cf. Frankena ''Op.cit.''13, pp.14,62; cf. Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Each group of theories tends to concentrate on different aspects of the subject so that if ethics can be defined as, say,  the principles governing the conduct of a person&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.6; cf. Gert &amp; Gert ''Op.cit''.85&lt;/ref&gt;  then the first group of theories ([[ontology]] and [[Deontological ethics|deontology]]) looks at the principles themselves, the second group of theories ([[teleology]] and [[consequentialism]]) looks at the aims and outcomes of conduct, and the third group of theories ([[virtue ethics]] and fitting-attitude theory) looks at the concept of the person, their character and attitudes.

===Ontology and Deontology===

[[Ontology]] (from the Greek ''Ontos'' meaning “being” or “that which is”)&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', 1940, pr.p. of ''ennai'' “to be”&lt;/ref&gt;  is that branch of metaphysics which deals with being, and, particularly in relation to value theory, with the “ontological categories” or plain [[Category of being|categories of being]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.9, p.52; cf. Moore Op.cit.11, pp.77ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman mentions [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] who pointed out that before discussing what we ought to value we should consider the possibility that anything that exists might be of value to somebody: “If we recognise that anything whatever may be good… we start with a much more open mind”.&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit''.11, pp.13,74; ''cf''. Perry ''Op.cit''.53, pp.115-116&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman introduced the concept of “[[supervenience]]” through which it is held that any structuring of our values will reflect the structuring of the underlying [[Category of being|categories of being]] themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; ''cf''. Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.9, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] is mentioned by Zimmerman in this respect, and also [[Christine Korsgaard]] who, drawing on Kant’s distinction between [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] and the [[Relation (history of concept)|relation between things]], draws a similar distinction between [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|intrinsic values]] (values in virtue of “non-relational properties”) and extrinsic values (values in virtue of “relational properties”).&lt;ref&gt;Ibid; cf. Korsgaard C. ''Two Distinctions in Goodness'' (in ''Philosophical Review'', 92, 169-95, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the former an impasse is reached when all that can be said of intrinsic values is, in Moore’s words, that goodness “just is”, or in Zimmerman’s words that pleasure “just is”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf Moore ''Op.cit''.11, pp.6ff&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led to some, like [[Monroe Beardsley]], to say that only extrinsic values, in the final analysis, exist.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Different kinds of extrinsic value in this model derive from the different underlying categories of relation, the example given being those of beauty, utility and meaning, each of which is supervenient on one of Kant’s three [[Category (Kant)|categories of relation]], namely disjunction, causality and inherence respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. ''Kant I. Critique of Pure Reason''  (tr. Smith N.K. Macmillan, London, 1968) pp.107,113&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Deontological ethics|Deontology]], on the other hand, (from the Greek ''Deon'' meaning “duty”)&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp; Scott ''Op.cit''.118&lt;/ref&gt;  is the branch of [[Value (ethics)|ethics]] that bases value on moral principles which in turn form a guide to knowing what "ought" to be done in various situations. The problem in philosophy of moving from an “is” to an “ought” (the “[[Is-ought problem]]") is said to have been introduced into philosophy by [[David Hume]]. Richmond Campbell, in discussing this, asks how one might move from a knowledge of what exists, i.e. from a whole range of possible values, to a knowledge of which, among these, one ought to value.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell R. ''Moral Epistemology'', 2003 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that “a small number of core moral values are espoused universally” the answer would appear to lie in giving priority to those which do not “conflict”. [[William Frankena|Frankena]] suggested that these moral principles are derived from three main sources: the prevailing moral rules of a culture; divine revelation as found in the holy texts; and logical or metaphysical deduction.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.12ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant’s [[categorical imperative]] is given as an example of the latter, although Frankena pointed out that a distinction would need to be made between arguments of [[Necessity and sufficiency|logical necessity]], i.e. those which contain no contradictions, and arguments of [[Necessity and sufficiency|logical sufficiency]] which would be needed to account for the various kinds of value, whether “aesthetic, prudential or logical”.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., pp.30-33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teleology and Consequentialism===

Mark Schroeder in his article on ''Value Theory'' considers [[consequentialism]] to be “under the umbrella” of [[teleology]],&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt;  where the latter can be defined as that branch of [[metaphysics]] which deals with the final end or purpose of things (the Greek ''Telos'' meaning “the end or purpose of an action”).&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp; Scott ''Op.cit''.118&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this group of theories things are instrumentally valuable which help to achieve either specific or general ends, and underlying this, Schroeder tells us, is the relation of [[Causality|cause and effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Frankena|Frankena]] defined [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|instrumental value]] as that which is good or useful for some purpose and he referred to [[Aristotle]] who, besides defining different [[Four causes|kinds of cause]], defined the good as “that at which all things aim”.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.86; ''cf''. Aristotle ''Op.cit''.30&lt;/ref&gt;  If for example the aim is to live a good life those things will be good or valuable which constitute the means for achieving such an end. However, what is good for a specific person and what is good for the world as a whole are two different things and are reflected, according to Schroeder, in the ideas of [[egoism]] and [[consequentialism]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the latter, Zimmerman writes that a value is good because of a perceived final end in which “all the consequences taken as a whole are good”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding the end at which people aim, [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]], according to Elinor Mason, thought that the sole end was that of  “[[pleasure]]”, and that all other values such as [[beauty]], [[friendship]], [[knowledge]] etc could be measured in accordance with the quantity of pleasure which each might afford.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Stuart Mill]] suggested that there were lower and higher pleasures and that these were fundamentally incommensurable. He went on to question, like [[Plato]], whether the values of pleasure or satisfaction were in fact the ends at which intelligent people should aim.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. Plato ''Op.cit''.16, p.505b&lt;/ref&gt;  Mason also refers to [[James Griffin (philosopher)|James Griffin]] who was of the opinion that “[[well-being]]” was a better name for such an end, and which he saw in terms of “[[flourishing]]” or a “maximisation of life” in all its aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin ''Op.cit''.76, pp.34,57&lt;/ref&gt;  A “balancing of elements” is required whereby those activities which we value for well-being, such as work, rest, love, solitude, health, accomplishment etc. should be considered “in various combinations” in order to afford a “framework” or a “plan of life” for ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., p.58; cf. Dewey ''Op.cit''.35, p.47 re “framework”&lt;/ref&gt;  This way of thinking was called by [[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]], in her article on [[John Dewey]], “objective list theory” as opposed to theories like Bentham’s based on pleasure or those of  Dewey based on “informed desire”.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson E. ''Dewey’s Moral Philosophy'', 2005 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  Dewey rejected the notion of a final end arguing instead that the “value of means and ends are reciprocally determined”.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey ''Op.cit''.35, pp.24,40ff&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Zimmerman, he challenged traditional metaphysical ideas with a more “pragmatic” approach saying that only through “calm, informed reflection” on the ways in which people “interact with the environment” and deal with the ensuing consequences can value be ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf. Dewey ''Op.cit''.35, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Virtue Ethics and Fitting-Attitude Theory===

Mason in her article on ''[[Value pluralism|Value Pluralism]]'' introduces [[virtue ethics]] as a third way of thinking about the subject of value and describes it as being based on how a person should “be” rather than what a person should “do”.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Frankena|Frankena]] had similarly introduced an “ethics of [[virtue]]” as a third approach (following [[Deontological ethics|deontology]] and [[consequentialism]]), suggesting that there were two kinds of things that we can value: either the things around us like knowledge or physical objects; or the things inside us like our [[Trait theory|disposition]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[Emotion|emotions]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the latter were the virtues and these he defined as dispositions to act in certain ways.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., pp.64,68&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the virtues, we can either value them in their own right or we can ask whether they tell us something about the nature of value itself. Hursthouse and Pettigrew deal with the first of these options in their article on ''[[Virtue Ethics]]'', asking questions like “how many virtues are there” and “how do they relate to each other”.&lt;ref&gt;Hursthouse R. &amp; Pettigrove G. ''Virtue Ethics'', 2003 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  C.B.Miller, on the other hand, in his article on [[Moral character|moral character]] points to recent work which suggests that the [[Category of being|categories]] used to structure the virtues are the same as those that can be used to structure values. The six “core virtues” listed by Peterson and Seligman have been found to be useful, for example, in the structuring of values in their “[[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|Values in Action]]” or VAI.&lt;ref&gt;Miller ''Op.cit''.55&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the similarities between [[virtue theory]] and fitting-attitude theory is that they both approach the subject of value through an emphasis on the agent.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1; cf. Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;  They are “agent-centred” rather than “act-centred” theories, but whereas virtues are defined purely as a disposition to act, fitting-attitude theory embraces the act as well within its field of consideration. [[Roderick Chisholm]] in his book, ''Brentano and Intrinsic Value'' [1986] suggested that value lies, for example, not just in [[virtue]] but in “individuals acting virtuously” or not just in [[pleasure]] but in “individuals experiencing pleasure”.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm ''Op.cit''.51, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;  However, just as there is conceived to be a necessary interaction between the agent and the environment so there is, in other circumstances, a necessary engagement between the agent and an object. Jacobson in his article on ''Fitting-Attitude Theory'' suggests that there is a reciprocity between “facts about human nature” and “facts about the object”,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit''.45&lt;/ref&gt;  and that “to be valuable” requires either that one’s “feelings are adequate to the object”, or that “the object is “fitting” in respect of some particular attitude.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of fittingness, or what might fit together, is extended to the relation between different values and, in particular, the possible conflicts between them, the examples given being between that of [[humour]] and [[Taste (sociology)|good taste]], or between what is considered funny and what is considered fair or just. Both Mason&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  and Zimmerman&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit.'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;  discuss the problem of [[Value pluralism|conflicting values]], as did [[Philippa Foot]] who, in the field of [[virtue ethics]], suggested that the answer to possible conflict lay in bringing the virtues, or values, into relation with one another saying “that even such concepts as love and justice can become dangerously distorted" if not tempered with a consideration of other fundamental values.&lt;ref&gt;Foot P. ''Virtues and Vices and Other Essays in Moral Philosophy'', 1978 (Clarendon press, Oxford, 2002) locs.125,225&lt;/ref&gt;

He took an early interest in drawing and by the time he was 12,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kemp|first=John R.|date=October 2017|title=City Stories|url=|journal=The Artist’s Magazine|volume=|pages=Pages 2–9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the choice had been made.

He went on to complete his BFA from The State University of New York in 1982&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and an MFA from Syracuse University in 1985.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subsequently, he pursued a career in Marvel Comics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.com/comics/creators/3562/vince_giarrano|title=Vince Giarrano|website=marvel.com|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DC Comics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dccomics.com/talent/vince-giarrano|title=Vince Giarrano|date=2012-03-04|work=DC|access-date=2018-03-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others as an illustrator. He credits his years’ of experience of drawing comic books to developing a sense of the narrative structure.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://luckycompiler.com/a-true-impression-of-life/|title=Vincent Giarrano Figurative Paintings: A True Impression of Life|date=2013-09-20|work=Lucky Compiler|access-date=2018-03-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Around 2000, Vincent again started to take an active interest in Fine Arts, particularly in realist painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He meticulously studied the works of John Singer Sargent, attended workshops and painted with friends.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From the middle of the decade his works started to appear in Group and Solo Exhibitions fairly frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.galleryhenoch.com/artists/giarrano/giarrano_bio.html|title=Gallery Henoch - Vincent Giarrano - Biography|website=www.galleryhenoch.com|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works have been exhibited in National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susanpowellfineart.com/portfolioitem/vincent-giarrano-2/|title=Vincent Giarrano {{!}} Susan Powell|website=www.susanpowellfineart.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and National Portrait Gallery, London.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Vincent loves painting the ubiquitous experiences from everyday lives. To him, these fleeting moments can carry something of infinite significance. It is also of extreme importance for him to effectively capture the light and create a moody atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Influence ==
Besides John Singer Sargent, other painters like [[Joaquín Sorolla]], [[Anders Zorn]] and [[Edward Hopper]] impress him deeply.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The enormous courage and sincere commitment of the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter [[Vincent van Gogh]] move him to the core.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Vladimir Ivanovich Dal''' (alternatively transliterated as '''Dahl'''; {{lang-ru|Влади́мир Ива́нович Даль}}; November 10, 1801&amp;nbsp;– September 22, 1872) was one of the greatest [[Russian-language]] [[lexicographer]]s and a founding member of the [[Russian Geographical Society]]. He knew at least six languages, including [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and is considered{{by whom|date=November 2017}} one of the early [[Turkology|Turkologists]]. During his lifetime he compiled and documented the [[oral history]] of the region{{which|date=November 2017}} that was later published in [[Russian language|Russian]] and became part of modern [[folklore]].

==Early life==
His father was a [[Denmark|Danish]] physician named Johan Christian von Dahl (1764 – October 21, 1821). He was a linguist versed in German, English, French, [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Yiddish]], [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]] languages. His mother, Maria Freitag, was of [[Germans|German]] and French descent ([[Huguenots|Huguenot]]). She spoke at least [[polyglotism|five languages]] and came from a family of scholars.

The prospective lexicographer was born in the town of Lugansky Zavod, in [[Novorossiya]] under the jurisdiction of [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]], part of [[Russian Empire]], which is now [[Luhansk]], Ukraine.
[[File:Vladimir Dal's house in Luhansk.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Dal's house and museum in [[Luhansk]], Ukraine.]] [[Novorossiya]] was part of [[Russia]]n [[colonization]], where [[Russian language|Russian]] was imposed as a common language in cities, but [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] remained prevalent in smaller towns, villages, and rural areas outside the immediate control of colonization. On the outskirts, the ethnic composition varied and included such nationalities as [[Ukrainians]], [[Greeks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Armenians]], [[Tatars]], and many others. Dal grew up under the influence of this various ethnic mixture of people and cultures.

Dal served in the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Navy]] from 1814 to 1826, graduating from the [[Sea Cadet Corps (Russia)|St Petersburg Naval Cadet School]] in 1819. In 1826, he began studying medicine at [[University of Tartu|Dorpat University]] and took part as a military doctor in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)]] and the [[November Uprising|campaign against Poland]] in 1831–1832. Following disagreement with his superiors, he resigned from the Military Hospital in St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg and took an administrative position with the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of the Interior]] in [[Orenburg]] Governorate, serving in similar positions in St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg and [[Nizhny Novgorod]] before his retirement in 1859.

Dal was interested in language and folklore from his early years. He started traveling by foot through the countryside, collecting sayings and fairy tales in various [[Slavic languages]] from the region. He published his first collection of [[fairy tale|fairy-tales]] in 1832 in [[Russian language]]. Some others, yet unpublished, were put in verse by his friend [[Alexander Pushkin]] and have become some of the most familiar texts in the Russian language. After Pushkin's fatal duel, Dal was summoned to his deathbed and looked after the great poet during the last hours of his life. In 1838, Dal was elected to the [[St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]].

==Lexicographic studies==
In the following decade, Dal adopted the pen name Kazak Lugansky ("[[Cossacks|Cossack]] from Luhansk") and published several realistic essays in the manner of [[Nikolai Gogol]]. He continued his lexicographic studies and extensive travels throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Having no time to edit his collection of fairy tales, he asked [[Alexander Afanasyev]] to prepare them for publication, which followed in the late 1850s. Joachim T. Baer wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;
While Dal was a skilled observer, he lacked talent in developing a story and creating psychological depth for his characters. He was interested in the wealth of the Russian language, and he began collecting words while still a student in the Naval Cadet School. Later he collected and recorded fairy tales, folk songs, birch bark woodcuts, and accounts of superstitions, beliefs, and prejudices of the Russian people. His industry in the sphere of collecting was prodigious.&lt;ref name="Terras, p. 92"&gt;Terras, ''Handbook of Russian Literature'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His magnum opus, ''[[Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language]]'', was published in four huge volumes in 1863–1866. ''The [[Saying]]s and Bywords of the Russian people'', featuring more than 30,000 entries, followed several years later. Both books have been reprinted innumerable number of times. Baer says: "While an excellent collector, Dal had some difficulty ordering his material, and his so-called alphabet-nest  system was not completely satisfactory until [[Baudouin de Courtenay]] revised it thoroughly in the third (1903–1910) and fourth (1912–1914) editions of the ''Dictionary''."&lt;ref name="Terras, p. 92"/&gt;

Dal was a strong proponent of the native rather than adopted vocabulary. His dictionary began to have a strong influence on literature at the beginning of the 20th century; in his 1911 article "Poety russkogo sklada" (''Poets of the Russian Mold''), [[Maximilian Voloshin]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Just about the first of the contemporary poets who began to read Dal was [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]]. In any case, contemporary poets of the younger generation, under his influence, subscribed to the new edition of Dal. The discovery of the verbal riches of the Russian language was for the reading public like studying a completely new foreign language. Both old and popular Russian words seemed gems for which there was absolutely no place in the usual ideological practice of the intelligentsia, in that habitual verbal comfort in simplified speech, composed of international elements.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Voloshin, "Поэты русского склада," in [http://az.lib.ru/w/woloshin_m_a/text_0410.shtml Sovremenniki] (Russian text).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While studying at Cambridge, [[Vladimir Nabokov]] bought a copy of Dal's dictionary and read at least ten pages every evening, "jotting down such words and expressions as might especially please me"; [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] took a volume of Dal with him as his only book when he was sent to the prison camp at [[Ekibastuz]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Boyd, ''Vladimir Nabokov: The Russian Years'' (Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The encompassing nature of Dal's dictionary gives it critical [[linguistics|linguistic]] importance even today, especially because a large proportion of the dialectal vocabulary he collected has since passed out of use. The dictionary served as a base for [[Max Vasmer|Vasmer]]'s ''[[Etymological dictionary]] of the Russian language'', the most comprehensive Slavic etymological lexicon.

For his great dictionary Dal was honoured by the [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]] Medal, the [[Constantine Medal]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rgo.ru/en/society/awards/constantine-medal-irgs|title= Constantine Medal of the IRGS|publisher= Russian Geographical Society|accessdate = 25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1863) and an honorary fellowship in the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

He is interred at the [[Vagankovskoye Cemetery]] in Moscow. To mark the 200th anniversary of Vladimir Dal's birthday,  [[UNESCO]] declared the year 2000 The International Year of Vladimir Dal.

==Legacy==
* In 1986 a museum in [[Moscow]], Russia, was opened [[:ru:Музей В. И. Даля|in honor of Dal]].
* In [[Luhansk]], Ukraine, the home of Dal has been converted into a [[:ru:Литературный музей Владимира Даля|Literary Museum]] where the employees managed to collect the lifetime editions of Dal's complete literary works.
* In 2001, a Luhansk ([[Ukraine]]) university was named after Dal, the [[East Ukraine Volodymyr Dahl National University]] (from his name in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.snu.edu.ua/index.php?mode=17 official website East Ukraine Volodymyr Dahl National University – History section] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425073918/http://en.snu.edu.ua/index.php?mode=17 |date=2009-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2017, [[:ru:Государственный литературный музей|the State Literary Museum]] in [[Moscow]], Russia received a new official name: the State Museum of the History of Russian Literature named after V. I. Dal.

==Blood libel affair==
[[File:Dal's tomb.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Dal's grave]]

Dal served in the Ministry of Domestic Affairs. His responsibilities included overseeing investigations of murders of children in the western part of Russia.

In 1840, the [[Damascus Affair]] had revived the medieval [[blood libel]] canard in Europe (the [[anti-Semitic]] accusation that Jews use the blood of Christian children for ritual purposes), and [[Czar Nicholas I]] instructed his officials, especially Vladimir Dal, to thoroughly investigate the legend. In 1844, just 10 copies of a 100-page report, intended only for the czar and senior officials, were submitted. The paper was entitled ''"Investigation on the Murder of Christian Children by the Jews and the Use of Their Blood."'' It was claimed there that although the vast majority of Jews had not even heard of ritual murder, it and the use of blood for magical purposes were committed by sects of fanatical Hasidic Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Poliakov|Poliakov, Léon]]. The History of Anti-Semitism: Suicidal Europe, 1870–1933. University of Pennsylvania Press. 2003. p.84.&lt;/ref&gt; While the paper is often attributed to Dal, the question of the authorship (or multiple authorships) remains controversial.

In 1914, 42 years after Dal's death, during the blood libel trial of [[Menahem Mendel Beilis]] in [[Kiev]], the then 70-year-old report was published in St. Petersburg under the title ''Notes on Ritual Murders''. The name of the author was not stated on this new edition, intended for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Poliakov|Poliakov, Léon]]. The History of Anti-Semitism: Suicidal Europe, 1870–1933. University of Pennsylvania Press. 2003. p.357.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2970">Dr '''William Angus Sinclair''' OBE [[Territorial Decoration|TD]] [[FRSE]] DLitt (1905&amp;ndash;1954) was a 20th century Scottish philosopher.

==Life==
He was born in [[Edinburgh]] on 27 September 1905 the son of Captain John Sinclair of the [[Mercantile Marine]] and his wife Elizabeth Campbell. He was educated at [[George Watson's College]] then studied Philosophy at [[Edinburgh University]] graduating MA. In 1932 he began lecturing in Logic at [[Edinburgh University]].

In 1939 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Norman Kemp Smith]], [[James Pickering Kendall]], [[Ernest Ludlam]] and [[Francis Albert Eley Crew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Second World War]] he served as a gunnery officer with the [[Royal Artillery]] in Italy. In the final year he served as Assistant Adjutant General organising the supply of personnel to the airborne divisions.

In 1945 he stood as a Conservative candidate in local elections but his politics changed and soon after he affiliated himself to the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;https://cairngormwanderer.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/the-sinclair-hut-one-of-the-cairngorms-lost-bothies/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==

The '''Sinclair Hut''' (sometimes rather grandly entitled the '''Sinclair Memorial Hall''') was a shelter bothy at the [[Chalamain Gap]] in the Cairngorms erected by the OTC and named in Sinclair's honour. Sadly the bothy was demolished in 1991, for reason of continual graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;https://cairngormwanderer.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/the-sinclair-hut-one-of-the-cairngorms-lost-bothies/&lt;/ref&gt;
