Forbes.com (August 19, 2010). Retrieved on 2012-03-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
==== Filmmaking ====
She turned to the family business of filmmaking with a documentary film, ''Pray the Devil Back to Hell'', directed by [[Academy Award]]-nominated, [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-winning filmmaker Gini Reticker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/uncategorized/women-war-peace-about-the-producers/4089/ |title=Women, War &amp; Peace ~ About the Producers : Wide Angle |publisher=Pbs.org |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://praythedevilbacktohell.com/ |title=Pray the Devil Back to Hell |publisher=Pray the Devil Back to Hell |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forkfilms.net/about/#42-staff/1/612-gini-reticker |title=About |publisher=Fork Films |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pray the Devil Back to Hell'' brought to light the work of Liberian [[peace]] activist [[Leymah Gbowee]] by telling the story about the critical role women played in bringing peace to war torn [[Liberia]]. ''Pray the Devil Back to Hell'' won Best Documentary at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2008, and screened in 60 countries around the world on all seven continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Pray the Devil Back to Hell {{!}} Tribeca Film Festival|url = https://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/512ce84d1c7d76e046000e51-pray-the-devil-back-to-he|website = Tribeca|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Pray the Devil Back to Hell: Filmmakers|url = http://praythedevilbacktohell.com/filmmakers.php|website = praythedevilbacktohell.com|accessdate = 2015-09-30|first = Fork Films|last = LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007, she and Gini Reticker founded [[Fork Films]], a New York-based production company that seeks to shed light, evoke compassion, stir action and build peace. She is the President and CEO, and Reticker is the Chief Creative Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forkfilms.net/about/ |title=About |publisher=Fork Films |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, Fork Films and Film Sprout partnered together to create ''Pray the Devil Back to Hell''{{'s}} Global Peace Tour, a nine-month grassroots screening tour that culminated on the [[United Nations]]' International Day of Peace on September 21, 2009. In total, the tour brought the film to 31 foreign countries, 45 U.S. states and 235 U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pray the Devil Back to Hell: Global Peace Tour |url=http://praythedevilbacktohell.com/globalpeacetour.php |website=Praythedevilbacktohell.com |accessdate=2015-09-30 |first=Fork Films |last=LLC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004165126/http://praythedevilbacktohell.com/globalpeacetour.php |archivedate=October 4, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film is broadly credited with highlighting the bravery and sacrifice of its lead figure, Leymah Gbowee, who received a Nobel Peace Prize in 2011.

The response to ''Pray the Devil Back to Hell'' led Disney to work on the five-part special series for [[PBS]], ''Women, War &amp; Peace'', which aired in 2011 and was the winner of the Overseas Press Club's [[Edward R. Murrow]] Award, a Gracie Award, a Television Academy Honor and the America Bar Association's Silver Gavel Award (for ''I Came to Testify''). This series created and executive produced by Abigail Disney, Pamela Hogan and Gini Reticker looked at the role of women in war in the modern age, not just as victims of conflict, but as active agents for peace in their communities. Also in 2011, Disney received an [[Athena Film Festival]] Award for her extraordinary use of film for social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/women-war-and-peace/ |title=Women, War and Peace |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://athenafilmfestival.com/ |title=February 18-21, 2016 New York City |publisher=Athena Film Festival |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney executive produced ''The Trials of Spring'' (2015), a major documentary event that includes a feature-length documentary, six short films, articles by award-winning journalists, and an ongoing robust social media conversation about women and their unwavering quest for social justice and freedom. The feature film, directed by Gini Reticker, chronicles the story of 21-year-old Hend Nafea, who sets out on a search for freedom and justice in a country gripped by a dangerous power struggle where there is little tolerance for the likes of her. The six short films were featured on ''[[The New York Times]]'' homepage in the six days leading up to the world premiere of ''The Trials of Spring'' at the [[Human Rights Watch]] Film Festival in New York City in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trialsofspring.com/about |title=About &amp;#124; |publisher=Trialsofspring.com |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2015-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014183028/http://www.trialsofspring.com/about |archivedate=October 14, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney made her directorial debut with ''The Armor of Light,'' which follows pro-life [[evangelical Christianity|evangelical]] minister Rev. [[Rob Schenck]], [[Lucy McBath]], the mother of teenager [[Shooting of Jordan Davis|Jordan Davis]], and [[John Michael Phillips]]. Jordan Davis was gunned down in [[Jacksonville]], [[Florida]] on November 23, 2012. Davis was unarmed at the time of his death, and his story has cast a spotlight on "[[Stand-your-ground law|Stand Your Ground]]" laws in the United States. The film follows Rev. Schenck as he meets McBath, a pro-choice Christian, and her attorney John Phillips. It leads to the question: is it possible to be both pro-gun and pro-life? ''The Armor of Light'' premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in April 2015 before opening theatrically on October 30, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The armor of light|url = http://www.armoroflightfilm.com/|website = THE ARMOR OF LIGHT|accessdate = 2015-10-21|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it was nominated for an Emmy Award.

==== Community activism and philanthropy ====
Disney and her husband Pierre Hauser created [http://www.daphnefoundation.org The Daphne Foundation] in 1991 in order to fund programs that confront the causes and consequences of poverty in the five boroughs of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About|url = http://www.daphnefoundation.org/about/|website = Daphne Foundation|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Disney launched [http://www.peaceisloud.org Peace is Loud], a nonprofit organization that inspires action through media and live events that spotlight women leaders on the frontlines of peacebuilding worldwide. The organization’s mission is to generate a groundswell of people committed to building a culture of peace. Disney serves as the Founder and President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Our Team|url = http://www.peaceisloud.org/our-team/|website = Peace is Loud|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney has made several overseas trips with fellow peace activists, including [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel]] laureate Leymah Gbowee. The two traveled to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) in 2011 to spend a week working with women peace activists and to explore ideas for building peace in their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Women Peacebuilders in the DRC – Nobel Women's Initiative|url = http://nobelwomensinitiative.org/2011/06/women-peacebuilders-in-the-drc/|website =Nobelwomensinitiative.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, they visited [[Sri Lanka]], where women activists launched the Sri Lankan Women's Agenda on Peace, Security and Development, inspired by Gbowee's legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa.com/blog/a_local_girl_with_a_global_platform_leymah_gbowee_and_sri_lanka/ |title=A Local Girl with a Global Platform: Leymah Gbowee and Sri Lanka |publisher=Africa.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 she renounced her share of the profits from the Disney family investment in the [[Ahava]] cosmetics company whose factory is located in a [[West Bank]] settlement. She stated "I cannot in good conscience profit from what is technically the 'plunder' or 'pillage' of occupied natural resources..." For legal reasons she could not withdraw her investments and therefore donated the investments and profits "to organizations working to end this illegal exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/07/16/3100916/disney-heir-renounces-profits-from-ahava "Disney heir renounces profits from Ahava"], [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], July 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Disney joined Gbowee and 28 other international women peacebuilders to cross the 2-mile wide De-Militarized Zone (DMZ) separating [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]] in an act of [[solidarity]] with Korean women and to call for an end to the [[Korean War]]. The peacebuilders headed international peace symposia in [[Pyongyang]] and [[Seoul]], where they listened to Korean women and shared experiences of mobilizing women to end conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = WomenCrossDMZ Peace Walk 2015|url = https://www.womencrossdmz.org|website = Womencrossdmz.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Disney married Pierre Norman Hauser in 1988 and has four children. Her first son is named Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/09/style/abigail-disney-phd-candidate-weds-pierre-norman-hauser-2d-at-columbia.html |title=Abigail Disney, Ph.D Candidate, Weds Pierre Norman Hauser 2d at Columbia |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1988-10-09 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2010/08/19/abigail-disney-women-war-forbes-woman-power-women ]{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpeaceacademy.us/edresources/dialogues/npa-5th-birthday-with-abigail-disney/ |title=NPA 5th Birthday with Abigail Disney |publisher=Nationalpeaceacademy.us |date=2014-03-04 |accessdate=2015-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122224713/http://nationalpeaceacademy.us/edresources/dialogues/npa-5th-birthday-with-abigail-disney/ |archivedate=November 22, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agnes Campbell, Lady Roseburn''' (1637 — 24 July 1716), Scottish businesswoman, was "Scotland's wealthiest early modern printer."&lt;ref&gt;Alastair J. Mann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRBkCOC8d-4C&amp;lpg=PA53 "'A Mongrel of Early Copyright': Scotland in European Perspective"] in Ronan Deazley, Martin Kretschmer, and Lionel Bently, eds., ''Privilege and Property: Essays on the History of Copyright'' (Open Book Publishers 2010): 53. {{ISBN|9781906924188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Agnes Campbell was the daughter of Isobel Orr and James Campbell. Her father was a merchant in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]]. She was baptized on 1 September 1637.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Rendall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zs6qBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA62 "Agnes Campbell (Lady Roseburn)"] in Elizabeth Ewan, Sue Innes, and Sian Reynolds, eds., ''The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women'' (Edinburgh University Press 2006): 61-62. {{ISBN|9780748626601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Agnes Campbell married printer Andrew Anderson in 1656. In 1663, Anderson became printer to the Edinburgh Town Council, and in 1671, he was named [[Queen's Printer|King's Printer]] for Scotland. When her husband died in 1676, 38-year-old Agnes took over the exclusive licence&lt;ref&gt;Clare Jackson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUcT221m02sC&amp;lpg=PA43 ''Restoration Scotland, 1660-1690: Royalist Politics, Religion and Ideas''] (Boydell Press 2003): 43. {{ISBN|9780851159300}}&lt;/ref&gt; and built the largest printing business in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Fox, [http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/11876642/_Little_Story_Books_and_Small_Pamphlets_in_Edinburgh.pdf "'Little Story Books' and 'Small Pamphlets' in Edinburgh, 1680-1760: The Making of the Scottish Chapbook"] ''Scottish Historical Review'' 92(2)(2013): 207-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnes Campbell remarried in 1681.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Simonton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c8oTzX0_H60C&amp;pg=PT116 "Widows and Wenches: Single Women in Eighteenth-Century Urban Economies"] in Deborah Simonton and Anne Montenach, eds., ''Female Agency in the Urban Economy: Gender in European Towns, 1640-1830'' (Routledge 2013): 116. {{ISBN|9781136275029}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1693, her petition to Parliament was granted, and Agnes Campbell's printing business remained independent from her second husband Patrick Telfer's financial oversight.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair J. Mann, "Book Commerce, Litigation and the Art of Monopoly: The Case of Agnes Campbell, Royal Printer, 1676-1712" ''Scottish Economic and Social History'' 18(2)(1998): 132-156. {{DOI|10.3366/sesh.1998.18.2.132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rps.ac.uk/search.php?action=print&amp;id=50636&amp;filename=william_and_mary_trans&amp;type=trans "Act in Favour of Agnes Campbell"] (1693), The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2015).&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[Daniel Defoe]]'s Scottish printer, and published a folio edition of his poem "Caledonia."&lt;ref&gt;Paula R. Backscheider, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j9x8AlKeGGEC&amp;pg=PA224 ''Daniel Defoe: His Life''] (Taylor &amp; Francis 1992): 224. {{ISBN|9780801845123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Eaton Burch, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/459125 "Defoe and his Northern Printers"] ''Proceedings of the Modern Language Association (PMLA)'' 60(1)(March 1945): 121-128. {{DOI|10.2307/459125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1709, she launched a paper mill at [[Penicuik]], the first paper mill on the [[River Esk (Lothian)|River Esk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penicuikpapermaking.org/mills.html Paper Mills] Penicuik Papermaking: 300th Anniversary.&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed printer the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in 1712, around the same time that the King's Printer appointment expired and was granted to one of her rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Rendall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zs6qBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA62 "Agnes Campbell (Lady Roseburn)"] in Elizabeth Ewan, Sue Innes, and Sian Reynolds, eds., ''The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women'' (Edinburgh University Press 2006): 61-62. {{ISBN|9780748626601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Agnes Campbell was Presbyterian in religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Warren McDougall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OtiqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118 "Developing a Marketplace for Books: Edinburgh"] in Stephen Brown and Warren McDougall, eds., ''The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland Volume 2'' (Edinburgh University Press 2011): 118. {{ISBN|9780748628964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She purchased an estate, Roseburn, in 1704, and was thereafter known as Lady Roseburn. She married twice, and had at least eight children. She died in July 1716, age 78, in Edinburgh, and left a significant fortune to her heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Mann, "Embroidery to Enterprise: The Role of Women in the Book Trade of Early Modern Scotland" in Elizabeth Ewan and Maureen M.

A short biography of Lady Roseburn was published in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Fairley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A56OGQAACAAJ ''Agnes Campbell, Lady Roseburn, Relict of Andrew Anderson, the King's Printer: A Contribution to the History of Printing in Scotland''] (D.

The '''American International Toy Fair''' (stylized as '''TOY FAIR''') is an annual toy industry [[trade show]] held in mid-February in New York City's [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]] and at toy showrooms around the city. The event is open to the toy trade only – toy industry professionals, retailers, and press representatives. It is owned and managed by the [[Toy Industry Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toy-tia.org/template.cfm Toy Industry Association] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209031416/http://www.toy-tia.org/Template.cfm |date=February 9, 2006 }} main site&lt;/ref&gt; Toy Fair's promoters describe it as the largest toy trade show in the Western hemisphere.

==History==
Toy Fair began in February 1903. The first event featured less than ten toy companies with [[Lionel Corporation|Lionel]] [[toy train|trains]] among the featured products.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Angela [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/10/business/fi-toyfair10 It's Not All Child's Play at Toy Fair] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (February 10, 2003). Retrieved September 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As the event expanded, more space was needed which led to toy companies occupying 200 Fifth Avenue, a [[Fifth Avenue Hotel|former hotel site]], in 1910. By 1925, it was renamed the [[Toy Center|International Toy Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Peter [http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/02/23/toy-fair-2004-day-one-batman-harry-potter-justice-league TOY FAIR 2004 DAY ONE: BATMAN, HARRY POTTER &amp; JUSTICE LEAGUE] [[IGN]] (February 14, 2004). Retrieved September 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 110th annual Toy Fair, held February 10–13, 2013, attracted more than 1,500 manufacturers, distributors, importers, and sales agents from 30 countries in over {{convert|300000|sqft|m2}} of exhibit space. Nearly 9,500 buyers from 5,000 retail outlets attended. Overall, there were an estimated 30,000 attendees from 92 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyassociation.org/PressRoom2/News/2013_News/American_International_Toy_Fair___February_10-13__2013___Welcomes_Surge_in_Global_Visitors.aspx#.UeLz1lNOnbQ American International Toy Fair – February 10–13, 2013 – Welcomes Surge in Global Visitors].

==Venues==
[[Image:TIA 2006ToyFair Toy center dscn6859.jpg|right|thumb|240px|200 Fifth Avenue]]
The Javits exhibits feature demonstrations and displays in an open trade show setting, while the toy district showrooms allow buyers to consult with sales representatives from the major toy manufacturers in a quieter setting. These showrooms can be found at

* 200 Fifth Avenue between 23rd &amp; 24th Streets
* 1107 Broadway at 24th Street
* 230 Fifth Avenue between 26th &amp; 27th Streets

Each building (they are interconnected by upper story walkways) contains relatively small showrooms from many manufacturers. Products featured include current lines as well as samples of products not yet introduced, or products under development. Many manufacturers will stage receptions or events prior to the fair itself for invited buyers, media representatives, or dignitaries.

==Attendance==

'''Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Software''' is [[software]] used in the [[finance]] and [[legal]] industries to meet the legal requirements for [[financial institutions]] and other regulated entities to prevent or report [[money laundering]] activities.  There are four basic types of software that address anti-money laundering:
transaction monitoring systems, [[currency transaction report]]ing (CTR) systems, customer identity management systems and compliance management software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/anti-money-laundering/anti-money-laundering-software/|title=What Is Anti Money Laundering Software? I ComplyAdvantage|last=|first=|date=|work=ComplyAdvantage|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Anti-money laundering guidelines came into prominence globally after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the subsequent enactment of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] in the United States and the establishment of the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF).  By 2010 many jurisdictions globally required [[financial institutions]] to monitor, investigate and report transactions of a suspicious nature to the financial intelligence unit in their respective country.

An entire industry developed around providing software to analyze transactions in an attempt to identify transactions or patterns of transactions, called [[structuring]], which requires a [[Suspicious activity report|SAR]] filing, or other suspicious patterns that qualify for SAR reporting. Financial institutions faced penalties for failing to properly file CTR and SAR reports, including heavy fines and regulatory restrictions, even to the point of charter revocation.

==Types==
There are four basic types of software addressing AML business requirements:
* Transaction monitoring systems, which focus on identification of suspicious patterns of transactions which may result in the filing of [[Suspicious Activity Report]]s (SARs) or Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs).  Identification of suspicious (as opposed to normal) transactions is part of the KYC requirements.
* [[Currency Transaction Report]]ing (CTR) systems, which deal with large cash transaction reporting requirements ($10,000 and over in the U.S.)
* Customer identity management systems which check various negative lists (such as [[OFAC]]) and represent an initial and ongoing part of [[Know your customer]] (KYC) requirements. Electronic verification can also check against other databases to provide positive confirmation of ID such as (in the UK: electoral roll; the "share" database used by banks and credit agencies; telephone lists; electricity supplier lists; post office delivery database
* Compliance software to help firms comply with AML regulatory requirements; retain the necessary evidence of compliance; and deliver and record appropriate training of relevant staff.  In addition, it should have audit trails of compliance officers activities in particular pertaining to the handling of alerts raised against customer activity. 

===Transaction monitoring software===
These software applications effectively monitor bank customer transactions on a daily basis and, using customer historical information and account profile, provide a "whole picture" to the bank management. Transaction monitoring can include cash deposits and withdrawals, wire transfers and ACH activity. In the bank circles, these applications are known as "AML software".

Each vendor's software works somewhat differently.  Some of the modules which should be present in an AML software are:
*Know Your Customer
*Entity Resolution
*Transaction Monitoring
*Compliance Reporting
*Alert based case management
*Investigation Tools
*Document management to hold the customer related documentation such as account opening package, customer identification documents, etc...
*Delivery of AML Training
*Customer due diligence checks, including electronic verification
*Automated Standard operating procedures e.g. workflow engine/
*Dissemination of AML policies and procedures

===Customer Identity Management Systems===
The definition for Customer Identity Management Systems varies in different regions and jurisdictions. Most vendors include the following features in their solutions:
*Sanction List Check
*Politically Exposed Person (PEP) Check
*False Positive Recording
*Single Scan and Batch Scanning
*Auditing and Reporting

===Machine learning for money laundering detection===
There are solutions based on artificial intelligence, which are characterized by much better efficiency in detecting money laundering, comparing to rule-based approach. Especially, deep neural networks  are able to discover complex interdependencies between various activities performed to launder money. This translates into fewer false alarms and more accurate detection. In the near future, transaction monitoring systems will be based on machine learning rather than on rules and scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Blue Ocean Strategy''''' is a marketing theory from a book published in 2004 which was written by [[W. Chan Kim]] and Renée Mauborgne, professors at [[INSEAD]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Based on a study of 150 strategic moves spanning more than a hundred years and thirty industries, Kim and Mauborgne argue that companies can succeed by creating "blue oceans" of uncontested market space, as opposed to "red oceans" where competitors fight for dominance, the analogy being that an ocean full of vicious competition turns red with blood.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

They assert that these strategic moves create a leap in value for the company, its buyers, and its employees while unlocking new demand and making the competition irrelevant. The book presents analytical frameworks and tools to foster an organization's ability to systematically create and capture blue oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kim, W.C. |author2=Mauborgne, R. |title=Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant|year=2004|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston|isbn=978-1591396192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expanded edition of Blue Ocean Strategy was published in February, 2015.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

== Book layout and concepts ==
The book is divided into three parts:{{fact|date=July 2018}}
as the other scenarios differ from those mentioned below would be an entirely separate story vice versa.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

1. The first part presents key concepts of blue ocean strategy, including Value Innovation – the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost – and key analytical tools and frameworks such as the strategy canvas and the four actions framework. The four actions framework aids in eliminating the trade-off between differentiation and low cost within a company. The four actions framework consists of the following:{{fact|date=July 2018}}

*Raise: This questions which factors must be raised within an industry in terms of product, pricing or service standards.
*Eliminate: This questions which areas of a company or industry could be completely eliminated to reduce costs and to create an entirely new market. 
*Reduce: This questions which areas of a company’s product or service are not entirely necessary but play a significant role in your industry, for example, the cost of manufacturing a certain material for a product could be reduced. Therefore, it can be reduced without completely eliminating it. 
*Create: This prompts companies to be innovative with their products. By creating an entirely new product or service, a company can create their own market through differentiation from the competition.&lt;ref name="Blue Ocean Strategy: From Theory to Practice"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=W. Chan|last2=Mauborgne|first2=Renée|title=Blue Ocean Strategy: From Theory to Practice |journal=California Management Review|date=2004|volume=47|issue=3|page=105-121 |doi=10.2307/41166308 |url=http://cmr.ucpress.edu/content/47/3/105 |accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. The second part describes the four principles of blue ocean strategy formulation. These four formulation principles address how an organization can create blue oceans by looking across the six conventional boundaries of competition (Six Paths Framework), reduce their planning risk by following the four steps of visualizing strategy, create new demand by unlocking the three tiers of noncustomers and launch a commercially viable blue ocean idea by aligning unprecedented utility of an offering with strategic pricing and target costing and by overcoming adoption hurdles. The book uses many examples across industries to demonstrate how to break out of traditional competitive (structuralist) strategic thinking and to grow demand and profits for the company and the industry by using blue ocean (reconstructionist) strategic thinking. The four principles are:
# how to create uncontested market space by reconstructing market boundaries,
# focusing on the big picture,
# reaching beyond existing demand and supply in new market spaces 
# getting the strategic sequence right.
3. The third and final part describes the two key implementation principles of blue ocean strategy including tipping point leadership and fair process. These implementation principles are essential for leaders to overcome the four key organizational hurdles that can prevent even the best strategies from being executed. The four key hurdles comprise the cognitive, resource, motivational and political hurdles that prevent people involved in strategy execution from understanding the need to break from status quo, finding the resources to implement the new strategic shift, keeping your people committed to implementing the new strategy, and from overcoming the powerful vested interests that may block the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flevy.com/blue-ocean-strategy|title=Blue Ocean Strategy Overview|publisher=Flevy|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technoparktoday.com/blue-ocean-strategy/|title=Blue Ocean Strategy|last=Kumar|first=Ajay S.|publisher=TechnoparkToday.com|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposition===
In the book the authors draw the attention of their readers towards the correlation of success stories across industries and the formulation of strategies that provide a solid base to create unconventional success – a strategy termed as "blue ocean strategy". Unlike the "red ocean strategy", the conventional approach to business of beating competition derived from the military organization, the "blue ocean strategy" tries to align innovation with utility, price and cost positions. The book mocks at the phenomena of conventional choice between product/service differentiation and lower cost, but rather suggests that both differentiation and lower costs are achievable simultaneously.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

The authors ask readers "What is the best unit of analysis of profitable growth? Company? Industry?" – a fundamental question without which any strategy for profitable growth is not worthwhile. The authors justify with original and practical ideas that neither the company nor the industry is the best unit of analysis of profitable growth; rather it is the strategic move that creates "blue ocean" and sustained high performance. The book examines the experience of companies in areas as diverse as watches, wine, cement, computers, automobiles, textiles, coffee makers, airlines, retailers, and even the circus, to answer this fundamental question and builds upon the argument about "value innovation" being the cornerstone of a blue ocean strategy. Value innovation is necessarily the alignment of innovation with utility, price and cost positions. This creates uncontested market space and makes competition irrelevant. The new chapters in the expanded edition of the book deal with the issues of how to develop and align the three strategy propositions of value, profit and people, how to sustain and renew blue ocean strategy at both the business level and the corporate level, and how to avoid red ocean traps that keep organizations anchored in existing market space even as they attempt to create new market space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Nathen|title=‘Blue Ocean Strategy’ Surges in Schools|url=http://poetsandquantsforexecs.com/2015/05/12/blue-ocean-strategy-surges-through-b-schools/|website=Poets &amp; Quants for Executives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following section discusses the concept behind the book in detail.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

== Concept ==
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}
[[File:Dralion-Vienna.jpg|thumb|[[Cirque du Soleil]] – an example of creating a new market space, by blending opera and ballet with the circus format while eliminating star performers and animals.]]

The metaphor of red and blue oceans describes the market universe.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Red oceans represent all the industries in existence today – the known market space. In the red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are known. Here companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of product or service demand. As the market space gets crowded, prospects for profits and growth are reduced. Products become [[commodities]] or [[Niche market|niche]], and cutthroat competition turns the ocean bloody; hence, the term "red oceans".&lt;ref name="BOS"&gt;{{cite web

|df = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue oceans, in contrast, denote all the industries not in existence today – the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set. Blue ocean is an analogy to describe the wider, deeper potential of market space that is not yet explored.&lt;ref name="BOS"/&gt;

The cornerstone of blue ocean strategy is "value innovation", a concept originally outlined in Kim &amp; Mauborgne's 1997 article "Value Innovation - The Strategic Logic of High Growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kim, W.C. |author2=Mauborgne, R. |title=Value Innovation – The Strategic Logic of High Growth|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=January–February 1997|volume=75|pages=103–112|url=http://hbr.org/2004/07/value-innovation-the-strategic-logic-of-high-growth/ar/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Value innovation is the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost, creating value for both the buyer, the company, and its employees, thereby opening up new and uncontested market space. The aim of value innovation, as articulated in the article, is not to compete, but to make the competition irrelevant by changing the playing field of strategy. The strategic move must raise and create value for the market, while simultaneously reducing or eliminating features or services that are less valued by the current or future market. The Four Actions Framework is used to help create value innovation and break the value-cost trade-off.  Value innovation challenges [[Michael Porter]]'s idea that successful businesses are either low-cost providers or niche-players.  Instead, blue ocean strategy proposes finding value that crosses conventional [[market segmentation]] and offering value ''and'' lower cost. Educator Charles W. L. Hill proposed a similar idea in 1988 and claimed that Porter's model was flawed because differentiation can be a means for firms to achieve low cost. He proposed that a combination of differentiation and low cost might be necessary for firms to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Many others have proposed similar strategies. For example, Swedish educators [[Jonas Ridderstråle]] and [[Kjell Nordström]] in their 1999 book ''[[Funky Business]]'' follow a similar line of reasoning. For example, "competing factors" in blue ocean strategy are similar to the definition of "finite and infinite dimensions" in ''Funky Business''. Just as blue ocean strategy claims that a red ocean strategy does not guarantee success, ''Funky Business'' explained that "Competitive Strategy is the route to nowhere". ''Funky Business'' argues that firms need to create "sensational strategies". Just like blue ocean strategy, a sensational strategy is about "playing a different game" according to Ridderstråle and Nordström. Ridderstråle and Nordström also claim that the aim of companies is to create temporary monopolies. Kim and Mauborgne explain that the aim of companies is to create blue oceans, that will eventually turn red. This is the same idea expressed in the form of an analogy. Ridderstråle and Nordström also claimed in 1999 that "in the slow-growth 1990s overcapacity is the norm in most businesses". Kim and Mauborgne claim that blue ocean strategy makes sense in a world where supply exceeds demand.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

=== Blue ocean vs. red ocean ===
Kim and Mauborgne argue that while traditional competition-based strategies (red ocean strategies) are necessary, they are not sufficient to sustain high performance. Companies need to go beyond competing. To seize new profit and growth opportunities they also need to create blue oceans. The authors argue that competition based strategies assume that an industry's structural conditions are given and that firms are forced to compete within them, an assumption based on what academics call the structuralist view, or environmental determinism. To sustain themselves in the marketplace, practitioners of red ocean strategy focus on building advantages over the competition, usually by assessing what competitors do and striving to do it better. Here, grabbing a bigger share of the market is seen as a [[zero-sum game]] in which one company's gain is achieved at another company’s loss. Hence, competition, the supply side of the equation, becomes the defining variable of strategy. Here, cost and value are seen as trade-offs and a firm chooses a distinctive cost or differentiation position. Because the total profit level of the industry is also determined by structural factors, firms principally seek to capture and redistribute wealth instead of creating wealth. They focus on dividing up the red ocean, where growth is increasingly limited.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Blue ocean strategy, on the other hand, is based on the view that market boundaries and industry structure are not given and can be reconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players. This is what the authors call ''the reconstructionist view''. Assuming that structure and market boundaries exist only in managers’ minds, practitioners who hold this view do not let existing market structures limit their thinking. To them, extra demand is out there, largely untapped. The crux of the problem is how to create it. This, in turn, requires a shift of attention from supply to demand, from a focus on competing to a focus on ''value innovation'' – that is, the creation of innovative value to unlock new demand. This is achieved via the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low-cost. As market structure is changed by breaking the value/cost tradeoff, so are the rules of the game. Competition in the old game is therefore rendered irrelevant. By expanding the demand side of the economy, new wealth is created. Such a strategy therefore allows firms to largely play a non–zero-sum game, with high payoff possibilities.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

== Examples ==

===Examples documented in the book===

Some examples of companies that may have created new market spaces in the opinion of Kim and Mauborgne include:{{fact|date=July 2018}}
* [[Cirque du Soleil]]: Blending of opera and ballet with circus format while eliminating star performer and animals;
* [[Netjets]]: fractional jet ownership;
* [[Southwest Airlines]]: offering flexibility of bus travel at the speed of air travel using secondary airports;
* [[Curves International|Curves]]: redefining market boundaries between health clubs and home exercise programs for women;
* [[Home Depot]]: offering the prices and range of [[lumber yard]], while offering consumers classes to help them with [[DIY]] projects;
* [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]]: [[Cyclonic_separation|Cyclonic]] [[Vacuum Cleaners]].

===Recent application examples===

Reports of businesses using blue ocean strategy concepts include:{{fact|date=July 2018}}

* [[China Mobile]]: China Mobile CEO Wang Jianzhou talked about China's hinterland as a classic "blue-ocean market," where the company is casting its net widely without worrying about getting tangled up with the nets of rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/08/06/100156748/index2.htm|title=China's mobile maestro (pg. 2) - August 6, 2007|first=By Clay Chandler, Fortune senior|last=writer|website=money.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pitney Bowes]]: Michael Critelli, the departing CEO of Pitney Bowes, explained how Pitney Bowes created the Advanced Concept &amp; Technology Group (ACTG), a unit responsible for identifying and developing new products outside. Critelli cited ACTG's development of a machine, which enables people to design and print their own postage from their desktops, as an example of a blue ocean strategic move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbusinesslive.com/search/article/655150/wb-interview-michael-critelli/|title=World Business Interview: Michael Critelli, 9 May 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide]]: In an interview to INSEAD Knowledge, Robyn Pratt, Vice President, Six Sigma and Operational Innovation, talks about how Starwood is taking a step-by-step approach to implementing the concept.&lt;ref&gt;INSEAD Knowledge: The Starwood experience {{cite web |url=http://knowledge.insead.edu/contents/starwood.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220014348/http://knowledge.insead.edu/contents/starwood.cfm |archivedate=2008-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wii]]: Rather than releasing a more technologically advanced video game console with more features as in previous generations, Nintendo released a console with innovative controls made to attract populations that are typically excluded from the target demographic for video games, such as the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Mike|title=Nintendo's Iwata Doesn't Fear Failure|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-10-10-nintendos-iwata-doesnt-fear-failure|newspaper=Gamesindustry|date=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[TATA Motors]]: With its recent product, the [[Tata Nano|Nano car]], the company has adopted a combination of differentiation and low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kim, W.C. |author2=Mauborgne, R. |author3=Bong, R. |author4=Ji, M. |title=Tata Nano: The People’s Car That Promises to Reconstruct the Automobile Industry|url=http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cb/web/product_detail.seam?E=4837562&amp;R=INS262-PDF-ENG&amp;conversationId=1840411|work=Harvard Business School Press |accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Starbucks]]: Starbucks entered a historically crowded marketplace, the coffee shop industry; however, it found its way to success through the blue ocean strategy. Starbucks separated itself from the competition by combining differentiation, low cost and a customer-oriented approach from the beginning of its operation. Starbucks also focused on maximizing its brand’s exposure, rather than solely focusing on itself as just another coffee shop. In terms of differentiation, Starbucks offered a variety of products, such as smoothies, teas and coffees that no other establishment was offering. By training specialised staff, the company operated with less staff than would usually be needed. Starbuck also championed professionalism and excellent customer service, for example, offering personalised coffee cups. To enhance the customer experience, Starbucks changed the furnishings in their stores, creating a comfortable environment that persuades their customers to spend more time in store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=TĂLPĂU|first1=A.|last2=BOŞCOR|first2=D.|title=CUSTOMER-ORIENTED MARKETING - A STRATEGY THAT GUARANTEES SUCCESS: STARBUCKS AND MCDONALD’S|journal=Bulletin of the Transilvania University Basov|date=2011|volume=4|issue=1|page=51-61|url=https://syokotablog.wordpress.com/2016/05/26/customer-oriented-marketing-a-strategy-that-guarantees-success-starbucks-and-mcdonalds/ |accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
While Kim and Mauborgne propose approaches to finding uncontested market space, at the present there are few success stories of companies that have actively applied their theories. One success story that does exist is [[Nintendo]], who first applied the blue ocean strategy to create the [[Nintendo DS]] [[handheld game system]] which was the first portable gaming system to offer dual-screen gaming and a [[touch screen]] in 2004. In 2006, Nintendo released the [[Wii]], which used unique motion controls. The [[3DS]] is Nintendo's third endeavour for its blue ocean strategy. Its first two attempts, the Nintendo DS and Wii, were wildly successful, becoming some of the biggest selling platforms in history. Nintendo revealed their Blue Ocean Strategy during an E3 press conference during the hype build-up of the Wii.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

However, with just one case study, this hole in their data persists despite the publication of value innovation concepts dating back to 1997. Hence, a critical question is whether this book and its related ideas are ''descriptive'' rather than ''prescriptive.''&lt;ref name="CMO"&gt;{{cite news | last = Pollard | first = Wayne E. | title = Blue Ocean Strategy's Fatal Flaw | publisher = CMO Magazine | date = 2004-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors present many examples of successful innovations, and then explain from their Blue Ocean perspective – essentially interpreting success through their lenses.&lt;ref name="twoscenarios"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://twoscenarios.typepad.com/maneuver_marketing_commun/blue_ocean_strategy/index.html | title=Multiple Critiques of Blue Ocean Strategy | year = 2007 | accessdate=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research process followed by the authors has been criticized on several grounds.&lt;ref name="twoscenarios" /&gt; Criticisms include claims that no [[control group]] was used, that there is no way to know how many companies using a blue ocean strategy failed and the theory is thus [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], that a [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] process was not followed, and that the examples in the book were selected to "tell a winning story".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Additionally, blue ocean strategy cannot be identified as true causation for success. The authors cite the strategies used by NYPD Commissioner Bratton as a key example of Blue Ocean applied in the public sector. They defined this success as a significant drop in crime in the City of New York after Bratton took office in 1994. Many social scientists would disagree that it was Bratton's policies that led to crime reduction: rather, the city was simply part of a nationwide trend in decreasing crime.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Brand and communication are taken for granted and do not represent a key for success. Kim and Maubourgne take the marketing of a value innovation as a given, assuming the marketing success will come as a matter of course.&lt;ref name="CMO"/&gt;

It is argued that rather than a theory, blue ocean strategy is an extremely successful attempt to [[Brand management|brand]] a set of already existing concepts and frameworks with a highly "sticky" idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/08/06/book-review-blue-ocean-strategy/ | title=Critique of Blue Ocean Strategy | year = 2007 | accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blue ocean/red ocean analogy is a powerful and memorable metaphor, which is responsible for its popularity. This metaphor can be powerful enough to stimulate people to action. However, the concepts behind the Blue Ocean Strategy (such as the competing factors, the [[Consumer behaviour|consumer]] cycle, non-customers, etc.) are not new. Many of these tools are also used by [[Six Sigma]] practitioners and proposed by other [[List of business theorists|management theorists]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Many of the book's key concepts were previously covered in ''Competing For The Future'' by [[Gary Hamel]] and [[C.K. Prahalad]], which was published in 1996.&lt;ref name=CultStrat&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt|first=Douglas |last2=Cameron |first2=Douglas |year=2010 |title=Cultural Strategy |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-958740-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors encouraged managers to stake out new marketing space, which they termed ''white space'', in order to "create and dominate emerging opportunities".&lt;ref name=CultStrat /&gt;

==World War II==

Boon Pong, using as cover his contract with the Imperial Japanese Army to supply the canteens of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[prisoners of war|POWs]] working along the [[Kwai Lo River]], smuggled medicine, money and contraband food to the POWs and is credited by many with saving thousands of lives during the building of the [[Burma Railway]].

Although Thailand made peace with the Japanese after being invaded, there was an active underground movement. One prisoner recalls Boonpong was the merchant with the lowest prices and the smallest mark up. However he performed other services risking his life and those of his family. He lent money, provided extra medicines and ran messages. With access to medicines, the death rate of the prisoners was reduced from five a day in May 1943 to one a week by the following November.

==Post-war==

After the war, Boonpong was attacked by Thai police in some mistaken retribution. Sir [[Edward Dunlop|Edward 'Weary' Dunlop]], another hero of the POW camps, ordered a report on 'the condition of Mr. Boonpong, injured Thai civilian, who had done so much for prisoners of war.’  In 1947 he was in financial difficulties and so a [[prisoner of war|POW]] association on hearing of it organised a collection for him. Shortly thereafter, Boonpong started the Boonpong Bus Company. In 1948 he was awarded the [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|MBE]] by the British Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-spiceislands.com/Thailand/boonpong.htm Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211143158/http://www.the-spiceislands.com/Thailand/boonpong.htm |date=February 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later an Australian medical scholarship was named in honor of him and Sir Edward Dunlop. The documentary film “The Quiet Lions” is about both of them. Boonpong also figures prominently in ''Beyond the Bamboo Screen'', a collection of anecdotes by Scottish PoWs.

==In popular culture==

[[Rungsak Loychusak]] portrayed Boonpong Sirivejjabhandu in ''[[Boonpong]]'' a [[thai television soap opera]] based on the true story him. ''Boonpong'' was broadcast on [[Thai Public Broadcasting Service|Thai PBS]] during 8 May 2013 - 20 June 2013.

The '''Broadway Theatre''' (formerly '''Universal's Colony Theatre''', '''B.S. Moss' Broadway Theatre''', '''Earl Carroll's Broadway Theatre''', and '''Ciné Roma''') is a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Theater (building)|theatre]] located in [[midtown Manhattan]]. It has a large [[seating capacity]] of 1,761, and unlike most Broadway theaters, it is actually located on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], at number 1681.

Designed by architect [[Eugene De Rosa]] for Benjamin S. Moss, it opened as ''B.S. Moss's Colony Theatre'' on [[Christmas Day]] 1924 as a venue for [[vaudeville]] shows and motion pictures. The theater has operated under many names and owners. It was renamed ''Universal's Colony Theatre'', ''B.S. Moss' Broadway Theatre'', and ''Earl Carroll's Broadway Theatre'' before becoming a [[legitimate theater]] house simply called ''Broadway Theatre'' on December 8, 1930. In 1937, known as ''Ciné Roma'', it showed [[Italian film]]s.&lt;ref name="NYTix"/&gt; For a short time during the 1950s it showed [[Cinerama]] films.&lt;ref name="BTHistory"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Broadway Theater History | work =New York City Theater | year =2011 | url =http://www.newyorkcitytheatre.com/theaters/broadwaytheater/history.php| accessdate =February 14, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 1928 the first [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon released to the public, [[Steamboat Willie]], debuted at the Colony. Producer [[Walt Disney]] returned on November 13, 1940 to debut the feature film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' in [[Fantasound]], an early stereo system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} 

The legitimate theater opened in 1930 with ''[[The New Yorkers]]'' by [[Cole Porter]]. Stars such as [[Milton Berle]], [[Alfred Drake]], [[José Ferrer]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Zero Mostel]], and [[Mae West]] have appeared on stage.&lt;ref name="NYTix"&gt;{{cite web | title =The Broadway Theatre|publisher =New York TV Show Tickets Inc. | year =2008  | url =http://www.nytix.com/Links/Broadway/Theaters/broadway.html| accessdate =February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Shubert Organization]] bought the theater in 1939 and renovated it extensively in 1956 and 1986. It has long been a popular theatre for producers of [[musical theatre|musicals]] because of large seating capacity, and the large stage, which is nearly sixty feet deep. Often plays that have become successful in smaller theaters have transferred to the Broadway Theatre.&lt;ref name="NYTix"/&gt;

The '''Cadillac Tower''' is a 40-story, {{convert|133.4|m|abbr=on}} [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] [[skyscraper]] designed by the [[architectural firm]] of Bonnah &amp; Chaffee at 65 Cadillac Square in [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]]  [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], not far from [[Renaissance Center]]. The building's materials include [[terra cotta]] and [[brick]]. It was built in 1927 as '''Barlum Tower'''. At the top of the tower is a tall [[guyed mast]] for local radio stations [[WMXD]], [[WDTW-FM]] and television station [[WLPC-CD]]. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

== History==
Cadillac Tower was the first building outside [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]] to have 40 floors, including two below ground. The building also houses the city of Detroit's Planning and Development Department, and its Recreation Department. Cadillac Tower's decorative cornices and parapets are of varying heights. The corner spires rise to a height of {{convert|130|m|abbr=on}}, and the spires at the middle façade rise to the same height of the mechanical penthouse at {{convert|133.4|m|abbr=on}}.

From 1994 to 2000, one side of the building featured a 14-story mural of [[Detroit Lions]] star player [[Barry Sanders]]. The mural was retired after a six-year deal with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] expired. That mural was then replaced with one of [[Detroit Red Wings]] star [[Steve Yzerman]]. Currently the building features an ad for the [[MGM Grand Detroit]] Casino featuring a lion.

In January 2008, the City of Detroit and Cadillac Tower's owner Northern Group, Inc., announced plans for [[Cadillac Centre]], a $150-million mixed-use residential entertainment-retail complex attached to the skyscraper. Designed by architect Anthony Caradonna, the contemporary steel and glass 24-story center would have filled in the currently vacant Monroe Block adjacent to [[Campus Martius Park|Campus Martius]]. This project was put on indefinite hold ultimately being replaced by Meridian Health Plan's future headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Daniel Duggan | title=Detroit Economic Growth Corp. ends Cadillac Centre deal | url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20081006/FREE/810060277/ | publisher=Crains Detroit Press | date=6 October 2008 | accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Connaught Place''' is one of the largest financial, commercial and business centres in [[New Delhi]], India. It is often abbreviated as '''CP''' and houses the headquarters of several noted Indian firms. As of July 2018, Connaught Place was the ninth most expensive office location in the world with an annual rent of USD 153 per sq ft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/connaught-place-worlds-9th-most-expensive-office-location/article24393852.ece|title=‘Connaught Place world’s 9th most expensive office location’|last=India|first=Press Trust of|date=2018-07-12|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/new-delhis-connaught-place-worlds-9th-most-expensive-office-location-with-annual-rent-of-153-per-sq-ft-cbre/1240054/|title=New Delhi’s Connaught Place world’s 9th most expensive office location with annual rent of $153 per sq ft: CBRE|date=2018-07-11|work=The Financial Express|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news18.com/news/ivideos/connaught-place-is-ranked-the-worlds-9th-most-expensive-office-location-1811759.html|title=Connaught Place Is Ranked The World's 9th Most Expensive Office Location|work=News18|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main commercial area of the new city, New Delhi, occupies a place of pride in the city and are counted among the top heritage structures in New Delhi. It was developed as a showpiece of [[Lutyens' Delhi]] with a prominent Central Business District(Delhi)
,
Named after [[Prince Arthur, 1st Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], construction work began in 1929 and was completed in 1933. However currently the design is in a poor state of repair with unsympathetic infill of balconies, mismatched shop fronts and development of central park significantly undermining the integrity of Robert Tor Russell's plans.

A [[Delhi Metro|metro]] railway station built under it is named [[Rajiv Chowk metro station|Rajiv Chowk]] (after [[Rajiv Gandhi]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/434849/NEW-DELHI-RENAMES-BRITISH-SITES-TO-HONOR-THE-GANDHIS.html?pg=all | title=New Delhi renames 'British' sites to honour the Gandhis | date=21 August 1995 | accessdate=14 July 2014 | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[Deseret News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the construction of Connaught Place, the area was a ridge, covered with ''[[Acacia nilotica subsp. indica|kikar]]'' trees and populated with jackals and wild pigs. Residents of the [[Kashmiri Gate (Delhi)|Kashmere Gate]], [[Civil Lines]] area visited during the weekends for [[partridge]] hunting.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt; The [[Hanuman Temple, Connaught Place|Hanuman Temple]] attracted many visitors from the [[Old Delhi|old walled city]], who came only on Tuesdays and Saturdays and before sunset, as the return trip was considered dangerous.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;

Residents of villages including ''Madhoganj'', ''Jaisingh Pura'' and ''Raja ka Bazaar'' were evicted to clear the area for the construction of Connaught Place and the development of its nearby areas. The villages were once situated along the historic Qutb Road, the main road connecting [[Shahjahanabad]], the walled city of Delhi (now known as [[Old Delhi]]) to [[Qutb Minar]] in south Delhi since the [[Mughal era]]. The displaced people were relocated in [[Karol Bagh]] to the west, a rocky area populated only by trees and wild bushes. However, three structures were spared demolition.  These were Hanuman temple, a Jain temple in Jaisinghpura and the [[Jantar Mantar, New Delhi|Jantar Mantar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A tale of two cities |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/newdelhi/A-tale-of-two-cities/Article1-740282.aspx |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=1 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702164816/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/newdelhi/A-tale-of-two-cities/Article1-740282.aspx |archivedate=2 July 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ht2013/&gt;[[File: Connaught Place New Delhi.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Tor Russell]] was the architect of Connaught Place|alt=|left]]

 and in the Classical style. However Nicholls left India in 1917, and with [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]] and [[Herbert Baker|Baker]] busy working on larger buildings in the capital, design of the plaza eventually fell to [[Robert Tor Russell]], chief architect to the [[Central Public Works Department|Public Works Department]] (PWD), Government of India.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;

Named after [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Prince Arthur]], 1st [[Duke of Connaught]] (1850–1942), third son of [[Queen Victoria]] and uncle of [[King George VI]] of England, who visited India in 1921 and laid the foundation of the ''Council House'' (now [[Sansad Bhavan]], or Parliament House).

Connaught Place's [[Georgian architecture]] is modelled after the [[Royal Crescent]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], designed by the architect [[John Wood the Younger]] and built between 1767 and 1774. While the Royal Crescent is semi-circular and a three storied residential structure, Connaught Place had only two floors, which made almost a complete circle intended to house commercial establishments on the ground with residential space on the first floor.&lt;ref name="ht"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/CP-s-blueprint-Bath-s-Crescent/Article1-659739.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130103040022/http://www.hindustantimes.com/CP-s-blueprint-Bath-s-Crescent/Article1-659739.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 January 2013 |title=CP's blueprint: Bath's Crescent |date=8 February 2011 |work=Hindustan Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circle was eventually designed with two concentric circles, creating an Inner Circle, Middle Circle and the Outer Circle with seven roads radiating from a circular central park. As per the original plan, the different blocks of Connaught Place were to be joined from above, employing archways, with radial roads below them. However, the circle was 'broken up' to give it a grander scale. Even the blocks were originally planned to be {{convert|172|m}} in height, but later reduced to the present two-storied structure with an open colonnade.

Government plans to have [[New Delhi Railway Station]] built inside Central Park were rejected by railway authorities as they found the idea impractical, and instead chose the nearby [[Paharganj]] area. Finally construction work began in 1929, with construction of the [[Viceroy's house|Viceroy House]] (present [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]]), [[Secretariat Building, New Delhi|Secretariat Building]], [[Sansad Bhavan|Parliament House]], and All-India War Memorial, [[India Gate]] were completed by 1933, long after the inauguration of the city in 1931.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="me"/&gt;

===Early years===
[[File:Central Park, Connaught Place (view from Parikarma restaurant).jpg|thumb|260px|View of the Central Park and Inner Circle of CP|alt=]]Early commercial establishments belonged to traders from the Kashmere Gate area: Kanter's, Galgotia and Snowhite. Most of the rulers of the Indian [[princely states]] had their local homes in the nearby areas around King's way (modern-day [[Rajpath]]), and would frequent shops for designer clothes, artefacts, shoes, and pianos. Regal cinema, the first cinema in Connaught Place, opened around this time and went on to host popular concerts, theatre groups, and ballet performances.The Odeon and Rivoli followed the Regal, while the Indian Talkie House opened in 1938.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="me"&gt;{{cite news|title=Breathing life into New Delhi|date=8 February 2011|work=Hindustan Times, Metro|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="htn"/&gt; Initially only Indian snacks were available in the area, but gradually restaurants opened in the plaza, with names like Kwality, United Coffee House and others offering Continental and Mughlai cuisines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=100 years of Dilli Khana |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/features/life/article2071297.ece |publisher=[[Business Line]] |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wenger's, the confectioners, was one of the first shops in Connaught Place, the firm also owned the largest restaurant in New Delhi on the first floor of their present A-Block outlet. Originally established in 1926 as Spencers in Kashmere Gate, Wenger's was owned by a Swiss couple and introduced Delhi to pastries and homemade [[Swiss chocolate]]s, though in its early years it too was patronised mostly by British officers, Indian royalty and some foreign-returned businessmen, for Delhi was still the city of classical taste within the walled city. Davico's across Connaught Plaza, and the Standard restaurant was popular for decades before fading away.  Another old timer, the Embassy Restaurant, opened in 1948.&lt;ref name="htn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/The-heart-of-Delhi-even-then/Article1-660169.aspx |title=The heart of Delhi, even then |date=9 February 2011 |work=Hindustan Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211214749/http://www.hindustantimes.com/The-heart-of-Delhi-even-then/Article1-660169.aspx |archivedate=11 February 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Imperial, New Delhi]]’s first [[luxury hotel]] opened in 1931 on Queen's Way, (modern-day [[Janpath]]) and eventually became a haunt for the royalty and a place for political discussions. It was here that [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]], [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and [[Lord Mountbatten]] met to discuss the [[Partition of India]] and the birth of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/india/new-delhi/48951/the-imperial/hotel-detail.html The Imperial, New Delhi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113174248/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/india/new-delhi/48951/the-imperial/hotel-detail.html |date=13 January 2011 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4hoteliers.com/4hots_fshw.php?mwi=1777 Famous Hotels: Imperial New Delhi – the making of] By Andreas Augustin. 4hoteliers.com. 11 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents gradually moved into first floor quarters, which were almost full by 1938, but it was another decade before the plaza became the busy marketplace that it became later, as World War II started and the Independence movement reached a feverish pitch.  Markets experienced dwindling sales, but post-independence business began to increase in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="me"/&gt;&lt;ref name="htn"/&gt;

===Post-independence===
Until the 1980s, a ''Phatphat Sewa'', a Harley Davidson [[Auto rickshaw|rickshaw]] service, took visitors from Connaught Place to the [[Red Fort]] and [[Chandani Chowk]], before it was stopped due to pollution concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horton|first=Patrick |title=Delhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ee1HTcplZS0C&amp;pg=PA82 |year=2002|publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=1-86450-297-5|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empty block of the Inner Circle came into use in the late 1970s with the construction of an underground market, the first in Delhi, ''[[Palika Bazaar]]'' at the junction point.  Stretching up to the Outer Circle, it also came with an adjoining underground parking lot. Also in the 1970s, the State Emporiums on Baba Karak Singh Marg radial emerged.&lt;ref name=ht2013&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a major alteration in the skyline was the addition of red sandstone (inspired by the historic Red Fort) and glass skyscraper, the ''Jeevan Bharti'' building ([[Life Insurance Corporation of India|LIC]] building), designed by architect [[Charles Correa]].  In 1986, it towered over the low-lying and predominantly white Connaught Place and was criticised for being too futuristic, but gradually as other skyscrapers were built on the periphery, the debate faded away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiasite.com/delhi/places/jeevanbhartibhawan.html|title=Jeewan Bharti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinemas==
[[File:Regal cinema, Connaught Place, New Delhi.jpg|right|260px|thumb|Regal cinema, Connaught Place's first theatre, opened in 1932, built by [[Sir Sobha Singh]], designed by [[Walter Sykes George]].]]After the introduction of [[talkies]] to [[Indian cinema]] in 1931, the new medium became a craze and in the 1930s and the 40s, four theatres opened within Connaught Place Plaza: Regal, Rivoli, Odeon and a short-lived "Indian Talkie House" that opened in 1938. Connaught Place became the entertainment hub of New Delhi. The Regal, the first theatre in the area, was opened in 1932 by [[Sir Sobha Singh]]. It was designed by architect [[Walter Sykes George]] and mainly hosted stage performances. In the coming years it hosted Western Classical music artists, Russian ballet and British theatre groups, and soon started morning and afternoon movie shows. The next theatre to be built was the Plaza in 1940, designed by Sir Robert Tor Russell, the architect of Connaught Place itself. It was owned by director and actor [[Sohrab Modi]] until the early 1950s. The Odeon was built in 1945 and had the city’s second 70mm screen after the "Shiela Cinema" in [[Paharganj]]. The Rivoli, close to the Regal, was the smallest theatre in the area. Half a century later most of the theatres were still running, although most had changed ownership. The Plaza and Rivoli are now owned by multiplex giant [[PVR Cinemas]], while the Odeon is a joint venture with [[Reliance Big Pictures]].&lt;ref name="ht"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fourht&gt;{{cite news|title=The famous four|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/coverage/Delhi100/The-famous-four/newdelhi/SP-Article10-745362.aspx|publisher=Hindustan Times|date=14 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023021832/http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/coverage/Delhi100/The-famous-four/newdelhi/SP-Article10-745362.aspx|archivedate=23 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is instantly recognisable on any map of Delhi as a big circle in the middle with radial roads spreading out in all directions. Eight separate roads lead out from Connaught Places's inner circle, named Parliament Street and Radial Roads 1 through 7. Twelve different roads lead out from Connaught Circus, the outer ring. The best known of these is [[Janpath]], the continuation of Radial Road 1. It is a logically planned area and houses one of India's first underground markets, the [[Palika Bazaar]] (Municipal Market), named after ''[[nagarpalika]]''. The Outer Circle is known as the Connaught Circus (officially Indira Chowk), having rows of restaurants, shops and hotels, and on December 1, 2017, The Regal Building was reopened as Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, the very first in India. The Middle Circle has offices, Banks, Exchange houses such as Thomascook, Atwexchange, PVR cinema and eating outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Brown|first=Lindsay|author2=Amelia Thomas|title=Rajasthan, Delhi &amp; Agra (Lonely Planet Travel Guides) |year=2008|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=1-74104-690-4|page=99|chapter=Connaught Place &amp; Around}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connaught Place's central park has long been a venue for cultural events and is a popular hangout for locals. In 2005–06, it was rebuilt after the construction of the [[Delhi Metro]] station below it. That station, [[Rajiv Chowk (Delhi Metro)|Rajiv Chowk]], is the interchange for the [[Yellow Line (Delhi Metro)|Yellow]] and [[Blue Line (Delhi Metro)|Blue]] lines of the Metro and one of the largest and busiest stations in the network.

Connaught Place hosts various cultural events in the central park area such as the Urdu Heritage Festival, One Billion Rising demonstrations, Delhi Government's Youth Festival, ''Awam Ki Awaz'' (Voices of People) concert and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sbcltr.in/2018/02/20/delhi-is-having-a-youth-festival/|title=Delhi Is Having A Youth Festival {{!}} sbcltr|website=sbcltr.in|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/urdu-heritage-festival-gets-a-makeover-to-be-held-in-cp-from-feb-15/story-fQ0lTwEZYN38OMPWGZumtN.html|title=Urdu Heritage Festival moves out of Old Delhi, will be held in Connaught Place from Feb 15|last=|first=|date=2018-02-14|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=2018-04-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-organises-voices-of-people-a-musical-platform-for-dissent/story-8d31LsDEpuurbT7TcMBvnI.html|title=Delhi govt organises ‘Voices of People’ a musical platform for dissent|last=|first=|date=2017-11-30|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=2018-04-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/shubha-mudgals-concert-in-delhi-on-saturday-to-celebrate-communal-harmony-free-speech-5030346/|title=Shubha Mudgal’s concert in Delhi on Saturday, to celebrate communal harmony, free speech|date=2018-01-18|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redevelopment plans==
{{update section|date=June 2014}}
By the late 2000s Connaught Place had lost much of its old glory, although the charm of the market continued to attract foot traffic. As a part of its 'Return to Heritage Project', the [[New Delhi Municipal Council]] (NDMC) prepared a plan to revamp and redevelop this Delhi landmark. The plan included provision of heritage sensitive signage, engineering improvements of roads, drainage sewerage, water supply and substations, development of a traffic management plan, provisions of street furniture including adequate parking, walkways etc. and enhancing the structural stability of all buildings including retrofitting for earthquake resistance. All these components have been identified based on studies conducted by various reputed agencies such as [[School of Planning and Architecture|SPA]], [[RITES]], CMCCC and NTPAC, etc.
[[File:View of Connaught Place at Night.JPG|300px|left|thumb|Connaught Place commercial area at Night]]
The redevelopment work was slated to be completed in time for the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] held at Delhi, but due to huge cost overruns and undue delays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CP restoration plan hit by undue delays: CAG|url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/article2321306.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; this deadline was not met. The Performance Audit Report prepared by [http://www.cag.gov.in/ Controller and Auditor General, India], on the Commonwealth Games 2010 concluded that there were "significant deficiencies in contract management, with consequent avoidable expenditure". Moreover, the mis-management and delays caused great inconvenience to shoppers and shop-owners alike, and led to a decline in trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NDMC’s digging frenzy in CP stalls traffic, hits trade|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-01-08/delhi/28146520_1_middle-circle-atul-bharghav-outer-circle|newspaper=The Times of India|date=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many store-owners complained of erratic power supplies and lost air-conditioning in their shops during the renovation work.

Work on the renovation was resumed soon after the Commonwealth Games, and is currently scheduled to meet the new deadline of December 2012. Till 2016 only the first phase for renovating blocks A &amp; B has taken place. By 2020 all the six blocks of Connaught Place would be renovated and brought to their original glory.

The art project [[United Buddy Bears]] was presented in Connaught Place during the summer of 2012.

On January 5, 2017, the Union Urban Development Ministry announced a plan to convert the middle and inner circles of Connaught Place, into an exclusive pedestrian zone, starting February 2017. As a result, people driving into the area will now have to park their vehicles at designated parking slots like [[Shivaji Stadium]], [[Palika Bazaar]] and then either walk to Connaught Place or use the shuttle bus service. However, [[Bicycles]] will be allowed in the pedestrian zones.
This move however does not have any planning as of January 24, 2017 and may be totally scrapped as the current infrastructure is insufficient to support the pedestrianisation of Connaught Place, Naresh Kumar Chairman of NDMC Reported Hindustan Times.

==Films==
Over the years, Connaught Place has been location many films including sequences in ''[[Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi]]'' (2003), ''[[Pyaar Ke Side Effects]]'' (2006), ''[[3 Idiots]]'' (2009), ''[[Aisha (film)|Aisha]]'' (2010), ''[[Delhi Belly (film)|Delhi Belly]]'' (2011), ''[[Rockstar (2011 film)|Rockstar]]'' (2011), ''[[Ahista Ahista (2006 film)|Ahista Ahista]]'' (2006), ''[[Agent Vinod (2012 film)]]'',
''[[Vicky Donor]]'' (2012),  ''[[Hate Story]]'' (2011), ''[[Special 26]]'' (2013), ''[[A Wednesday]]'' (2008), ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' (2006), ''[[PK (film)|PK]]'' (2014) and "[[2 States (film)|2 States]]" (2014)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7319">'''Distributed manufacturing''' also known as '''distributed production''', '''cloud producing''' and '''local manufacturing''' is a form of decentralized manufacturing practiced by enterprises using a network of geographically dispersed manufacturing facilities that are coordinated using [[information technology]]. It can also refer to local manufacture via the historic [[cottage industry]] model, or manufacturing that takes place in the homes of consumers.

==Consumer==
Within the [[maker movement]] and [[DIY]] culture, small scale production by consumers often using [[peer to peer]] resources is being referred to as distributed manufacturing. Consumers download digital designs from an [[open design]] repository website like [[Youmagine]] or [[Thingiverse]] and produce a product for low costs through a distributed network of 3D printing services such as [[3D Hubs]] or at home with an [[open-source 3-D printer]] such as the [[RepRap]].&lt;ref&gt;Sells, Ed, Zach Smith, Sebastien Bailard, Adrian Bowyer, and Vik Olliver. "Reprap: the replicating rapid prototyper: maximizing customizability by breeding the means of production." HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH IN MASS CUSTOMIZATION AND PERSONALIZATION, (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, R., Haufe, P., Sells, E., Iravani, P., Olliver, V., Palmer, C., &amp; Bowyer, A. (2011). Reprap??? the replicating rapid prototyper. Robotica, 29(1), 177-191.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Enterprise==
The primary attribute of distributed manufacturing is the ability to create value at geographically dispersed locations via manufacturing. For example, [[shipping]] costs could be minimized when products are built geographically close to their intended markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Durach|first=Christian F.|last2=Kurpjuweit|first2=Stefan|last3=Wagner|first3=Stephan M.|date=2017-09-25|title=The impact of additive manufacturing on supply chains|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/IJPDLM-11-2016-0332|journal=International Journal of Physical Distribution &amp; Logistics Management|volume=47|issue=10|pages=954–971|doi=10.1108/ijpdlm-11-2016-0332|issn=0960-0035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, products manufactured in a number of small facilities distributed over a wide area can be customized with details adapted to individual or regional tastes. Manufacturing components in different physical locations and then managing the supply chain to bring them together for final assembly of a product is also considered a form of distributed manufacturing.&lt;ref name=Chrisman&gt;{{cite web|last=Chrisman|first=Ray|title=Enhancement of Distributed Manufacturing using expanded Process Intensification Concepts|url=http://depts.washington.edu/cpac/Activities/Meetings/Satellite/2010/Wednesday/Chrisman_The%20Value%20of%20Distributed%20Manufacturing.pdf|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kühnle2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hermann Kühnle|title=Distributed Manufacturing: Paradigm, Concepts, Solutions and Examples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AnmyB1Gs-0C|accessdate=7 May 2013|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84882-707-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital networks combined with additive manufacturing allow companies a decentralized and geographically independent distributed production ([[Cloud manufacturing]]).&lt;ref name="Bopp2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Felix Bopp|title=Future Business Models by Additive Manufacturing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_SmmUOwsWwC|accessdate=4 July 2014|year=2010|publisher=Verlag|isbn=3836685086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Edinburgh BioQuarter''' is a [[bioscience]] community based near the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] and the [[Queen's Medical Research Centre]] in [[Edinburgh]], close to the [[Roslin Institute for Animal Biology]]. It is Scotland's key initiative in the development of its [[life sciences]] industry, which employs more than 30,000 people in 600 companies.&lt;ref name=Entente-Health&gt;{{cite web|title=Edinburgh BioQuarter, the University of Edinburgh|url=http://entente-health.eu/Networking_Area/Organisations/TTO/Edinburgh-BioQuarter-The-University-Of-Edinburgh.kl#.VatRnfmqpBc|publisher=Entente-Health|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2007, [[Scottish Enterprise]] completed a series of land deals which cleared a 55-acre site for development adjacent to the existing Royal Infimary of Edinburgh and the creation of the BioQuarter was announced. In early 2010, Dr [[Mike Capaldi (doctor)|Mike Capaldi]] joined BioQuarter as Commercialisation Director and the development of an executive team and business creation programme were launched.

The key partners in the Edinburgh BioQuarter initiative are [[Scottish Enterprise]]/[[Scottish Development International]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[NHS Lothian]].

From 2011, it will be joined at this location by the [[Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine]], giving the BioQuarter one of the highest concentrations of research classed officially by the government as "internationally leading" (four-star, according to the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise).

==Facilities and Companies==
[[File:Centre for Regenerative Medicine.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of the Centre for Regenerative Medicine]]
Edinburgh BioQuarter currently co-locates a 1000+-bed [[teaching hospital]], the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]], with the Queen’s Medical Research Institute (ranked #1 in the UK for [[Clinical research|clinical medical research]], according to the 2008 research assessment exercise) and the [[Clinical Research Imaging Centre]], or CRIC, opened by [[Prince Phillip|HM the Duke of Edinburgh]] in late 2010.&lt;ref name=UKSPA&gt;{{cite web|title=Edinburgh BioQuarter|url=http://www.ukspa.org.uk/members/ebq|publisher=UKSPA|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last three years, Edinburgh has attracted 53% of all [[Wellcome Trust]] grants in Scotland and 62% of [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) funding in Scotland, making it a major centre of research income.

In November 2011, a new [[bioincubator]] building will come on stream offering {{convert|80000|sqft|m2}} of office and laboratory space, as well as the new Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine (SCRM), headed by Professor Sir [[Ian Wilmut]], creator of "[[Dolly the Sheep]]." This new centre will apply Scotland’s world-leading [[stem cell research]] to new therapies for conditions such as [[Parkinson's disease]],{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[multiple sclerosis]] and other conditions.

In September &lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite web|title=Edinburgh BioQuarter gains three new tenants|url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/management/edinburgh-bioquarter-gains-three-new-tenants-1-2776226|publisher=Scotsman|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010, author [[JK Rowling]] endowed research at the BioQuarter with a £10 million gift to create the [[Anne Rowling Centre for Multiple Sclerosis]].

By 2016, the new [[Royal Hospital for Children and Young People]]&lt;ref name="Scottish Entreprise"&gt;{{cite web|title=Opportunities at Edinburgh BioQuarter|url=http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/services/develop-new-products-and-services/bioquarter-commercialisation/overview|publisher=Scottish Entreprise|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; will be located at the BioQuarter, together with the [[Scottish Mind and Body Institute]], a cross-disciplinary centre aimed at finding cures or therapies for [[Neurology|neurological conditions]].

==Companies based at Edinburgh BioQuarter==

Part of BioQuarter’s purpose is to create new companies based on [[medical research]] being undertaken in the [[National Health Service|NHS]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. For this purpose it has created an innovation competition, offering prizes worth £45,000 to researchers in all disciplines at the University of Edinburgh and [[NHS Lothian]]. The first round of these prizes will be awarded in March 2011.

Companies currently located at or associated with the BioQuarter community include:&lt;ref name=UKSPA /&gt;

*[[Fios Genomics]] – genomic and bioinformatics data analysis services for [[drug discovery]] &amp; development
*[[Immunosolv]] – technologies and products for the removal of dead cells
*[[TPP Global Development]] - a drug development company with offices in London and Edinburgh
*[[I2Eye Ltd]] – [[visual field impairment]] testing for small children and [[special needs]] groups
*[[NeuroORG]] – [[management consultancy]] that shapes organisational behaviour on the basis of [[neurological science]]

Further companies are expected to join the BioQuarter community over the next twelve months as the process of company formation gathers pace. In addition, licensing deals and other partnerships with major international pharmaceutical companies and equipment manufacturers will add to the number of organisations housed at the BioQuarter.

'''Eloise Andrews Kruger''' (1914–1995) was an American [[Scale model|miniature]] collector from [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] who was known for her collection of historically-accurate American miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hemsath|first1=DiAnna|title=The Kruger Collection: Guide to the Eloise Kruger (1914-1995) Papers, 1959-1982, 1989, 1999-2003|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=arch_id_facultyschol|website=DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska - Lincoln|publisher=University of Nebraska - Lincoln|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Kruger was born in Lincoln, Nebraska on June 26, 1914 as the eldest of Vernon and Luella Dierks Andrews's four daughters. Her cousin, Carl Rohman, acclaimed supporter of the [[Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery]], remembers her being a very confident young woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Driesbach|first1=Janice|last2=Crouch|first2=Robb|title=Sheldon to name gallery in honor of Rohman family|url=http://newsroom.unl.edu/releases/2005/07/29/Sheldon+to+name+gallery+in+honor+of+Rohman+family|website=UNL News Releases|publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[The Great Depression|Depression]], she was exposed to a high level of living. She was a passionate reader, especially on the subjects of [[interior design]] and miniature collecting.&lt;br /&gt;
She graduated from Lincoln High in 1932 and enrolled at the [[University of Nebraska]]. She only attended until 1934 because she wanted to help support her mother and sisters after her father abandoned the family for another woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith Arney|first1=Suzanne|title=Eloise Andrews Kruger: A Very Fine Focus|date=Spring 2009|publisher=Nebraska Magazine Writing Contest Winners|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|pages=18–19|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived with her aunt and uncle to help her three sisters pay for college, all of whom graduated.&lt;br /&gt;
She married Carl Kruger in 1939, and soon after became interested in miniature figures.
[[File:Victorian chairs.jpg|thumb|Miniature Furniture]]

== Career ==
She worked as a secretary, then was quickly promoted to executive secretary. Lee Syndicate hired her as an accountant, despite her lack of knowledge in the area. After buying books and studying she became adept at the trade. &lt;br /&gt;
During World War II, when most men were drafted, she was given war-time orders to hire and train women. Eventually she ran an all-woman accounting office until the war ended.&lt;br /&gt;
Even once her collection started, she still worked these jobs and helped her husband manage Paramount Laundry. &lt;br /&gt;
She was interested in sketching plans; she drew the house her mother built at 1935 Dakota Street.&lt;br /&gt;
Her accounting job allowed her to travel a lot. Her cousin, Carl (Ky), claimed that she would find many pieces for her collection on these trips.

== The collection and collecting methods ==
"When she undertook something she did it right. She studied and studied until she got it right" attested Carl Rohman Jr.&lt;br /&gt;
She began collecting in the 1930s. The height of her collecting took place in the 1970s and 1980s. She became a published author in ''Miniature Magazine'', commissioned outstanding miniature makers to create models from the American Neoclassical era, and reached out to collectors all over the country.&lt;br /&gt;
After assessing the number of [[Neoclassicism|American Neoclassical]], [[American colonial architecture|American colonial]] and [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]] pieces that she commissioned, it can be assumed those were her favorite eras. 
Her attention to detail was remarkable, as well as her records, documentation, and effort to learn as much about the eras as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugercollection.unl.edu/about|title=Eloise Kruger|last=|first=|date=|website=The Kruger Collection|publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All of the models were created at 1:12 scale. The pieces ranged from furniture, decorative arts, and accessories, from nearly every English and American design style, from [[Renaissance]] to [[Early Modern]], all of which  she commissioned to look as accurate to the real pieces as possible. [[File:Stairway model.jpg|thumb|Model in Kruger Gallery]] In 1968 alone, she wrote eighty-five different letters to collectors and artists across the country. The relationships represented varied in scope and familiarity. The key trends of these letters include writing multiple letters in one day (44% were written on Thursdays), and the increase of letters per month increasing to 34% in February. The patterns correlate with events that transpired in 1968, like [[Chicago riot of 1968|the Chicago riots]], her battle with undiagnosed dizzy spells, and a sprained arm that prevented her from writing. &lt;br /&gt;
In many of her letters she mentioned that she had an interest in creating 1:12 miniature rugs, many of which she gave away, despite the hours of work one required.&lt;br /&gt;
She worked on the [[Chippendale chair|Chippendale Back Stool]] that model maker, Eric Pearson, made custom for her. The flamestitch upholstery took 40 stitches per inch. In February, Eloise told Eunice Tuttle "the upholstery in this case is driving me to despair." Her two main correspondents were Thomas Devereux and Ellen Krucker, and these letters included more personal information, like politics and new cars, much more than simply invoices for her collection. Krucker was one of the two artists (aside from Pearson) that Eloise's husband thought made "worthwhile miniatures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strickland|first1=Melissa|title=A Year in a Miniaturist's Life: 1968 and Eloise Kruger|pages=4–11|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eloise rented the apartment across the hall from her home, just for storing her miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arney|first1=Suzanne|title=Interview with Ky Rohman|journal=PieceWork Magazine|date=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Top artists are Eric Pearson with 236 pieces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith Arney|first1=Suzanne|title=Eloise Kruger and Her Miniatures|date=September–October 2009|publisher=PieceWork Magazine|pages=16–23|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene Kupjack, Bob Carlisle, Warren Dick, Mell Prescott, and Betty Valentine.

== Death and legacy ==
Kruger died on November 19, 1995 at age 81. She was survived by her sister Jean, nephews Donald Campbell and Bob Campbell, and cousin Carl Rohman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituaries|journal=Lincoln Journal Star|date=November 30, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her collection was donated to the University of Nebraska - Lincoln in 1997 and is now held in the Kruger Gallery &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.unl.edu/newsrooms/today/article/kruger-collection-showcases-four-centuries-of-interior-design/|title=Kruger Collection showcases four centuries of interior design|last=Network|first=University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{!}} Web Developer|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.toyandminiaturemuseum.org/exhibits/eloise-krugers-meticulous-miniature-collection/|title=Eloise Kruger's Meticulous Collection - The National Museum of Toys and Miniatures|date=2015-01-27|work=The National Museum of Toys and Miniatures|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://architecture.unl.edu/news/kruger-gallery-opens-three-miniature-exhibitions|title=The Kruger Gallery Opens Three Miniature Exhibitions   {{!}} College of Architecture {{!}} University of Nebraska–Lincoln|last=Network|first=University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{!}} Web Developer|website=architecture.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; inside the College of Architecture. This contribution included over eight hundred books on the subjects of architectural detailing, to histories in ceramics, iron work, interior design, and kitchen space planning, as well as her miniature collection of over 20,000 pieces, valued at $500,000. The Kruger Gallery now uses her collection to increase awareness of architectural and interior eras, and in the field of material culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kruger Gallery Reception Address|journal=University of Nebraska College of Architecture &amp; Interior Design Program|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it's great [to be at UNL].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5832">'''Enterprise software''', also known as '''enterprise application software''' ('''EAS'''), is [[computer software]] used to satisfy the needs of an [[organization]] rather than individual users. Such organizations include businesses, schools, interest-based user groups, clubs, charities, and governments. Enterprise software is an integral part of a (computer-based) [[information system]].

Services provided by enterprise software are typically business-oriented tools, such as online shopping, and [[online payment]] processing, interactive product catalogue, automated billing systems, security, [[Business process management|Business Process Management]],  [[enterprise content management]], [[IT Service Management]], [[customer relationship management]], [[enterprise resource planning]], [[business intelligence]], [[project management]], [[collaboration]], [[human resource management]], manufacturing, [[Occupational safety and health|occupational health and safety]], [[enterprise application integration]], and [[enterprise forms automation]].

As enterprises have similar departments and systems in common, enterprise software is often available as a suite of customizable programs. Generally, the complexity of these tools requires specialist capabilities and specific knowledge.

==Definitions==
Enterprise Software describes a collection of computer programs with common business applications, tools for modeling how the entire organization works, and development tools for building applications unique to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gregvogl.net/courses/mis1/glossary.htm Management Information Systems Glossary of Terms]&lt;/ref&gt; The software is intended to solve an enterprise-wide problem, rather than a departmental problem. Enterprise level software aims to improve the enterprise's productivity and efficiency by providing [[business logic]] support functionality.

According to [[Martin Fowler]], "Enterprise applications are about the display, manipulation, and storage of large amounts of often complex data and the support or automation of [[business processes]] with that data."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Fowler]], "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" (2002). Addison Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is no single, widely accepted list of enterprise software characteristics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=504043 What is Enterprise Software?]&lt;/ref&gt; they generally include [[Software performance testing|performance]], [[scalability]], and [[Robustness (computer science)|robustness]]. Furthermore, enterprise software typically has interfaces to other enterprise software (for example [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] to [[directory service]]s) and is centrally managed (a single admin page, for example).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/enterprise-application-software/ Gartner Group: IT Glossary - enterprise application software]&lt;/ref&gt;

Enterprise [[application software]] performs business functions such as order processing, procurement, production scheduling, customer information management, energy management, and accounting. It is typically hosted on servers and provides simultaneous services to a large number of users, typically over a computer network. This is in contrast to a single-user application that is executed on a user's personal computer and serves only one user at a time.

== Types ==
Enterprise software can be categorized by business function. Each type of enterprise application can be considered a "system" due to the integration with a firm's business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/enterprise_application.html |title=What is enterprise application? - A Word Definition From the Webopedia Computer Dictionary |publisher=Webopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Categories of enterprise software may overlap due to this systemic interpretation. For example, IBM's Business Intelligence platform (Cognos), integrates with a predictive analytics platform (SPSS) and can obtain records from its database packages (Infosphere, DB2). Blurred lines between package functions make delimitation difficult, and in many ways larger software companies define these somewhat arbitrary categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-0810wurst/index.html |title=Integrate InfoSphere Warehouse data mining with IBM Cognos reporting, Part 1: Overview of InfoSphere Warehouse and Cognos integration architecture |publisher=Ibm.com |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, certain industry standard product categories have emerged, and these are shown below :
* [[Accounting software]]
* [[Electronic billing|Billing]] Management
* [[Business intelligence]]
* [[Business process management]]
* [[Content management system]] (CMS)
* [[Knowledge Management]] (KM)

'''Frederick Walter Scott Craig''' (10 December 1929 – 23 March 1989) was a Scottish [[psephology|psephologist]] and compiler of the standard reference books covering United Kingdom Parliamentary election results. He originally worked in [[public relations]], compiling election results in his spare time which were published by the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Scottish Unionist Party]]. In the late 1960s he launched his own business as a publisher of reference books, and also compiled various other statistics concerning British politics.

Craig also had a political career of his own, initially as an [[election agent]] and then as a candidate. Efforts to get elected in his native [[Glasgow]] being unsuccessful, after he moved to [[Chichester]] in 1970 he was first elected to the [[Chichester District|District Council]] and later to [[West Sussex]] County Council. However he fell out with a faction in the local [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and launched a rebel group which led to his expulsion. Late in his life he suffered severe depression and he committed suicide at the age of 59.

== Early life ==
Craig was a native of [[Glasgow]]. He became interested in election statistics while still at school.&lt;ref&gt;"He totes up the voting" ('Talk of the Times'), ''Glasgow Evening Times'', 27 June 1961, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He was active in the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Scottish Unionist Party]] Association, and in 1954 began to contribute the 'Scottish Parliamentary Election Manual' of election results to the ''Yearbook for Scotland'', which the party published.&lt;ref name="Reference Book" /&gt; Craig was unhappy with existing sources for election statistics and undertook research himself to correct the vote figures and discover the source of independent candidates, and his election manual became highly respected.

== Political activity ==
As a paid agent for the Unionist Party, Craig was the election agent for [[Sir James Hutchison, 1st Baronet|James Hutchison]] in [[Glasgow Scotstoun (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Scotstoun]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955 general election]] and for the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist]] parliamentary candidate in [[Rutherglen (UK Parliament constituency)|Rutherglen]] in 1964. He twice fought for election to the [[Politics of Glasgow|Glasgow City Corporation]] in the mid-1960s. His first attempt was in May 1966 when he came forward as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] Conservative candidate against the 'Progressive Party', a local alliance between Conservatives and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] which controlled the council, in [[Kelvinside]] ward. Craig offered to withdraw if the Progressive councillor would repudiate that party's policy on council house rents, and to sit as a Conservative if the party split up; the offer was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;"Lord Provost Appeals for High Poll Today", ''Glasgow Herald'', 3 May 1966, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1967 Craig was selected as official Conservative candidate for [[Gorbals]] ward in a byelection;&lt;ref&gt;"50-50 as City Tories get set for Elections", ''Glasgow Evening Times'', 5 September 1967, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; he was one of seven candidates and attempted to stand out by distributing on the eve of poll 5,000 'wage packets' containing an appeal to vote for him.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Skilling, "Tory's 'pay packet' plea to voters in Gorbals", ''Glasgow Evening Times'', 23 October 1967, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However Craig came third in the poll.&lt;ref&gt;"Labour hold Gorbals", ''Glasgow Evening Times'', 25 October 1967, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reference books ==
His research into elections continued and widened from Scotland to the whole of the United Kingdom, and he compiled a card index to all elections from 1918 onwards. In 1966 he had completed a manuscript of a reference book on statistics about elections since 1918, which was intended to be published in two volumes of 700 pages each to be part-funded by the Institute of Electoral Research; the calling of a [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|general election]] annoyed him because he would have to add the statistics from it to the book.&lt;ref name="Reference Book"&gt;Vincent Donnelly, "Reference Book", ''Glasgow Evening Times'', 28 February 1966, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig took a decisive step in 1968 when he was paid off from his public relations job and set up Political Reference Publications, to publish his work.&lt;ref name="Family"&gt;William Hunter, "Cottage industry based on the work of the 'House'", ''Glasgow Herald'', 27 November 1969, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The first book to be published was ''British Parliamentary Election Statistics 1918–1966'' which summarised the results of every general election as well as giving a wealth of other information. Critical reception was very positive and Craig always considered it his favourite book. It has continued to be updated, under the title ''British Electoral Facts''.

His series of ''British Parliamentary Election Results'' began to appear the next year with the volume for 1918–1949. The series has been completed to run from the [[Reform Act]] of 1832 to date. Craig also started the ''Political Companion'', a quarterly update, which ran from 1969 to 1983. His work was a family affair with his wife Phyllis helping with the production and administration, and his daughters undertaking the proofreading.&lt;ref name="Family" /&gt; Craig pioneered the use of technology and put the source data onto computer readable tape; the distinctive clear layout of his books was a result of his use of early computer [[typesetting]].

== Expanding company ==
In 1970 he moved from [[Anniesland Cross]] in Glasgow to [[Chichester]] in West Sussex and established another company, Parliamentary Research Services, which eventually took over all his activities. His public relations background led to new lines of business including compilation of activities of members of parliament from votes in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;"MPs go aground on data bank", ''The Times'', 8 November 1971, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of the [[BBC]] team, albeit behind the camera, on their programme covering the 1970 general election; in 1972 he was asked to help by both the BBC and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and decided to transfer to commercial television.&lt;ref&gt;"The Times Diary", ''The Times'', 7 February 1972, p. 12. He is one of two named 'Political Consultants' to ITN in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|second 1974 election]] on the back cover of "The ITN Election Handbook", compiled by Robert Hargreaves with Paul McKee (View No. 1, Independent Television Publications Ltd, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 he was elected to [[Chichester District Council]], but with the pressure of work caused by the two elections of 1974 he resigned his seat. When the candidate selected to replace him dropped out, Craig found that his busy period was over and was himself nominated to fight the by-election caused by his own resignation.&lt;ref&gt;"Comeback", ''The Times'', 26 November 1974, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig was a leading member of Chichester Concern, a group set up to oppose a pedestrianisation precinct in the centre of the city. He arranged for John Tyme, a lecturer in Environmental Studies at [[Sheffield Hallam University|Sheffield Polytechnic]] who had made a name opposing motorway schemes, to come to a public inquiry and oppose it. Tyme was unable to persuade the inquiry to adjourn and consider alternatives, and had to return home.&lt;ref&gt;Nikki Knewstub, "I expect wigging, says beaten Tyme", ''The Guardian'', 29 September 1976, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opinions ===
In 1975 Craig criticised the extension of [[postal votes]] to people on holiday at the time of elections, arguing that there were "very real dangers in any electoral system which permits extensive voting by post". He thought it absurd to increase postal voting facilities which might lead to widespread abuse because there were many ways of committing electoral fraud.&lt;ref&gt;"Market vote: Where no X marks the spot" (letters), ''The Guardian'', 23 April 1975, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig used the prefaces and forewords of his books to express opinions on the electoral system, arguing in 1977 that the increasing numbers of fringe and frivolous candidates in Parliamentary elections made it necessary to raise the level of the deposit required for a nomination to be valid.&lt;ref&gt;"Higher deposit urged for poll candidates", ''The Times'', 22 September 1977, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised the ability of people with holiday homes to register to vote in two constituencies, on the grounds that they could choose to vote in the most marginal. Craig pointed out that while it was illegal for dual registered voters to vote twice, the penalties were minimal and the offence difficult to detect.&lt;ref&gt;"Holiday home owners' voting law criticized", ''The Times'', 12 June 1980, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Chronology of British Parliamentary By-elections", Craig decried the "confusing and often misleading display of computer graphics" used on television election programmes, and also noted the decline in newspaper coverage of by-election campaigns by the broadsheet newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronology of British Parliamentary By-elections 1833–1987", Parliamentary Research Services, Chichester, 1987, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] conducted an inquiry into the Representation of the People Acts, Craig (through his company) submitted a memorandum calling for an increased deposit, prohibition of multiple registration, and prevention of candidates changing their names to ones similar to those of other candidates. He also pressed for Returning Officers to be compelled to send the official result of every Parliamentary election to the Clerk of the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;"Appendix 38: Memorandum submitted by the Parliamentary Research Services", "Representation of the People Act 1949", House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, Minutes of Evidence. HC 32-x 1982–83 p. 332-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservative split ==
At the West Sussex County Council election in 1981, Craig was elected as a Conservative councillor in Chichester West division, while his wife Phyllis won Chichester South division. He had been the Chairman of the Chichester City branch of [[Chichester (UK Parliament constituency)|Chichester]] Conservative Association for many years, but at a stormy meeting on 1 March 1982 he was voted out of office. When he spoke in support of his re-election, Craig had noted the presence of many unfamiliar faces and declared "I will oppose [[Wets and dries|wets]] and Left Wing infiltrators who would like to destroy this great party from within".&lt;ref&gt;"City Tories' ballot comes under fire", ''Chichester Observer'', 4 March 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1981 the Association had adopted a new policy under which it refused to pay election expenses for sitting councillors, although new candidates would be funded. Craig and the other sitting councillors considered this amounted to deselection and formed the 'Association of Conservative Councillors' which would raise funds for their election expenses.&lt;ref&gt;"Breakaway councillors defy Tory ultimatum", ''Chichester Observer'', 20 January 1983, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association of Conservative Councillors chose Craig as its election agent and declared its intention to nominate candidates against those of the Conservative Association.&lt;ref&gt;"Tory councillors start new group", ''Chichester Observer'', 1 April 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The resignation of a Liberal councillor led to a by-election for Chichester District Council in Chichester West ward in June 1982; Phyllis Craig was nominated in opposition to the official Conservative. The Liberal candidate held the seat with a majority of 149, with Phyllis Craig receiving 250 votes. It was widely perceived that her intervention had led to the Liberals winning a seat which otherwise would have been Conservative.&lt;ref&gt;"Battling Tories let Liberal in", ''Chichester Observer'', 8 July 1982, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig and his wife had their annual subscriptions returned by the Conservative Association in January 1983, which he denounced as "a back-door method of expulsion" and "a very nasty way of getting rid of someone."&lt;ref&gt;"Mayor expelled by Tory group in new flare-up", ''Chichester Observer'', 13 January 1983, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig and his wife stood as Independent Conservative candidates for Chichester District Council in the 1983 council elections,&lt;ref&gt;"Candidates for District Council", ''Chichester Observer'', 14 April 1983, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; but were not successful. He did not stand for re-election to the County Council in 1985 when his term ended. He later became a member of Chichester and Bognor Regis [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]].&lt;ref name="Found dead"&gt;"Elections expert found dead", ''Chichester Observer'', 30 March 1989, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suicide ==
Fred and Phyllis Craig separated in January 1988, placing the future of his business in jeopardy. The news was considered so important that the [[House of Commons Library]] issued a note to alert journalists to it.&lt;ref&gt;"Back page", ''The Observer'', 31 January 1988, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig sold his publishing business to Dartmouth Publishing, which later became part of [[Ashgate Publishing]]; he retained editorial control.&lt;ref name="Found dead" /&gt; He could not come to terms with living on his own, and attempted suicide in 1988 by taking an overdose of pills;&lt;ref name="Suicide"&gt;"Election expert killed himself", ''Chichester Observer'', 11 May 1989, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; the dedication of "Britain Votes 4" written in May 1988 records his thanks to family and friends as well as medical staff.&lt;ref&gt;"Britain Votes 4", Parliamentary Research Services, Chichester, 1988, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; However over the Easter holiday in 1989 he was found dead in his car having run a pipe from the exhaust. The cause of death was certified as [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] and the Coroner returned a verdict of suicide as "from the circumstances and from the notes which have been left, I have no doubt he intended the result of what he did".&lt;ref name="Suicide" /&gt;

After his death, his papers were given to Professors [[Colin Rallings]] and [[Michael Thrasher]] of the [[University of Plymouth]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20240">'''Fordism''' is the basis of [[modernity|modern]] economic and social systems in industrialized, standardized [[mass production]] and [[mass consumption]]. The concept is named for [[Henry Ford]]. It is used in [[social theory|social]], [[economic theory|economic]], and [[management theory]] about [[economic production|production]], [[working conditions]], [[economic consumption|consumption]], and related phenomena, especially regarding the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.willamette.edu/~fthompso/MgmtCon/Fordism_&amp;_Postfordism.html |title=Fordism &amp; Postfordism |publisher=www.willamette.edu |accessdate=2008-12-26 |last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Fordism is "the eponymous manufacturing system designed to spew out standardized, low-cost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeG05|De Grazia 2005]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been described as "a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production: the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor."&lt;ref name="TollidaySteven"&gt;Tolliday, Steven &amp; Zeitlin, Jonathan. ''The Automobile Industry and its Workers: Between Fordism and Flexibility'', St. Martin's Press (New York: 1987) pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry, the principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process. Major success stemmed from three major principles:

# The standardization of the product (nothing is handmade, but everything is made through machines and molds by unskilled workers)
# The employment of [[assembly line]]s, which use special-purpose tools and/or equipment to allow unskilled workers to contribute to the finished product
# Workers are paid higher "living" wages so that they can afford to purchase the products they make&lt;ref name="TollidaySteven" /&gt;

The principles, coupled with a technological revolution during Henry Ford's time, allowed for his revolutionary form of labor to flourish. His assembly line was revolutionary though not original as it had previously been used at slaughterhouses. His most original contribution to the modern world was breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones, with the help of specialised tools.&lt;ref name="Editedby"&gt;Edited by; Burrows, Rober; Gilbert, Nigel; Pollert, Anna. ''Fordism and Flexibility: Divisions and Change'' St. Martin's Press (New York: 1992) pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpler tasks created interchangeable parts that could be used the same every time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dt13as.html|title=A Science Odyssey: People and Discoveries: Ford installs first moving assembly line|author=|date=|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; That allowed for a very adaptable flexibility, creating an assembly line that could change its constituent components to meet the needs of the product being assembled.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; In reality, the assembly line had already been around before Ford although not in quite the same effectiveness as he would create. His real accomplishment was recognizing the potential by breaking it all down into its components, only to build it back up again in a more effective and productive combination, thereby producing an optimum method for the real world.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt;

The major advantages of such a change was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate, and it deskilled the labour itself, cutting down on costs of production.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; There are four levels of Fordism, as described by [[Bob Jessop]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Ford Motor Company assembly line.jpg|thumb|Ford cars (Model A shown) became a symbol of effective mass production. Efficiency both decreased the price of the cars and allowed Ford to increase his workers' wages. Hence, common workers could buy their own cars.]]

The [[Ford Motor Company]] was one of several hundred small automobile manufacturers that emerged between 1890 and 1910. After five years of producing automobiles, Ford introduced the [[Ford Model T|Model T]], which was simple and light but sturdy enough to drive on the country's primitive roads.&lt;ref name="FonerEric"&gt;Foner, Eric (2006).

Furthermore, Ford substantially increased his workers' wages&lt;ref&gt;Sward, Keith (1948). The Legend of Henry Ford. New York: Rinehart &amp; Company, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; to combat rampant absenteeism and employee turnover, which approached 400% annually, which had the byproduct of giving them the means to become customers. That led to massive consumption. In fact, the Model T surpassed all expectations because it attained a peak of 60% of the automobile output within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John B. (1969). Henry Ford. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production system that Ford exemplified involved synchronization, precision, and specialization within a company.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John B. (1969). Henry Ford. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford and his senior managers did not use the word "Fordism" themselves to describe their motivations or worldview, which they did not consider an "[[wikt:ism#Noun|ism]]". However, many contemporaries framed their worldview as one and applied the name Fordism to it.&lt;ref name="Hounshell_1984_pp263,376"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pages=263, 376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term gained prominence when it was used by [[Antonio Gramsci]] in 1934 in his essay "Americanism and Fordism" in his ''[[Prison Notebooks]]''. Since then, it has been used by a number of writers on [[economics]] and society, mainly but not exclusively in the [[Marxist]] tradition.

According to historian [[Charles S. Maier]], Fordism proper was preceded in Europe by [[Taylorism]], a technique of labor discipline and workplace organization, based upon supposedly-scientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems. It attracted European intellectuals, especially in Germany and Italy, from the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

After 1918, however, the goal of Taylorist labor efficiency thought in Europe moved to "Fordism," the reorganization of the entire productive process by the moving assembly line, standardization, and the mass market. The grand appeal of Fordism in Europe was that it promised to sweep away all the archaic residues of precapitalist society, by subordinating the economy, society, and even the human personality to the strict criteria of technical rationality.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; The [[Great Depression]] blurred the utopian vision of American [[technocracy]], but [[World War II]] and its aftermath revived the ideal.

The principles of Taylorism were quickly picked up by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and applied to the industrialization of the [[Soviet Union]].

Later, under the inspiration of Gramsci, Marxists picked up the Fordism concept in the 1930s and developed [[Post-Fordism]] in the 1970s. Antonio and Bonanno (2000) trace the development of Fordism and subsequent economic stages, from globalization to neoliberal globalization, during the 20th century, and emphasized America's role in globalization. "Fordism," for Gramsci, meant routine, intensified labor to promote production. Antonio and Bonanno argue that Fordism peaked in the post-World War II decades of American dominance and mass [[consumerism]] but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on the people in the 1970s.

Advances in technology and the end of the [[Cold War]] ushered in a new "neoliberal" phase of globalization in the 1990s. Antonio and Bonanno further suggest that negative elements of Fordism, such as economic inequality, remained, allowing related cultural and environmental troubles, which inhibited America's pursuit of democracy to surface.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio and Bonanno, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Thomas Hughes has detailed how the [[Soviet Union]], in the 1920s and the 1930s, enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism by importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]] and the centrally-[[planned economy]] can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. Hughes quotes [[Joseph Stalin]]:&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;Hughes, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"American efficiency is that indomitable force which neither knows nor recognizes obstacles; which continues on a task once started until it is finished, even if it is a minor task; and without which serious constructive work is inconceivable.... The combination of the Russian revolutionary sweep with American efficiency is the essence of Leninism."&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;{{rp|251}}}}

Hughes describes how, as the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both the Soviets and the Americans chose to ignore or deny the contribution of American ideas and expertise. The Soviets did so because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to their rivals. Americans did so because they did not wish to acknowledge, during the Cold War, their part in creating a powerful rival.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

==Regulation theory==
{{original research|date=November 2012}}

Fordism is a key concept in the theories of the [[Regulation school]], often in contrast to [[post-Fordism]], and the term is also used in [[Western Marxism|Western Marxist]] thought.

[[File:Mall culture jakarta36.jpg|thumb|Mass consumption is the other side of Fordism.]]

In Regulation theory, it is a "regime of accumulation" or a macroeconomic pattern of growth, developed in the US and diffused in various forms to Western Europe after 1945. It consisted of domestic [[mass production]] with a range of institutions and policies supporting mass consumption, including stabilizing [[economic policies]] and [[Keynesian]] demand management that generated national demand and social stability; it also included a class compromise or social contract entailing family-supporting wages, job stability and internal labor markets leading broadly shared prosperity: rising incomes were linked to national productivity from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. At the level of the labor process Fordism is [[Taylorist]] and as a national mode of regulation Fordism is [[Keynesianism]].

The social-scientific concept of "Fordism" was introduced by the French [[regulation school]], sometimes known as [[regulation theory]], which is a Marxist-influenced strand of political economy. According to the regulation school, capitalist production paradigms are born from the crisis of the previous paradigm; a newborn paradigm is also bound to fall into crisis sooner or later. The crisis of Fordism became apparent to Marxists in late 1960s.

Marxist regulation theory talks of Regimes of Capital Accumulation (ROA) and Modes of Regulation (MOR). ROAs are periods of relatively settled economic growth and profit across a nation or global region. Such regimes eventually become exhausted, falling into crisis, and are torn down as capitalism seeks to remake itself and return to a period of profit. Such periods of capital accumulation are "underpinned," or stabilised, by MOR. A plethora of laws, institutions, social mores, customs and hegemonies both national and international work together to create the environment for long-run capitalist profit.

Fordism is a tag used to characterise the post-1945 long boom experienced by western nations. It is typified by a cycle of mass production and mass consumption, the production of standardized (most often) consumer items to be sold in (typically) protected domestic markets, and the use of Keynesian economic policies. While the standard pattern is postwar America, national variations of this standard norm are well known. Regulation theory talks of National Modes of Growth to denote different varieties of Fordism across western economies.

Fordism as an ROA broke down, dependent on national experiences, somewhere between the late 1960s and the mid-1970s. Western economies experienced slow or nil economic growth, rising inflation and growing unemployment, much of this as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil shock]].

==Post-Fordism==
[[File:Office Worker with Two Monitors.JPG|thumb|Information technology, white-collar work, and specialization are some of the attributes of post-Fordism.]]

The period after Fordism has been termed [[Post-Fordism|Post-Fordist]] and Neo-Fordist. The former implies that global capitalism has made a clean break from Fordism, including overcoming its inconsistencies, but the latter implies that elements of the Fordist ROA continued to exist. The Regulation School preferred the term After-Fordism (or the French ''Après-Fordisme'') to denote that what comes after Fordism was or is not clear.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, S. Brave new world. ''Marxism Today'', October 1988, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Post-Fordist economies:&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;
* New information technologies are important.
* Products are marketed to [[niche market]]s rather than in mass consumption patterns based on [[social class]].
* [[Service industry|Service industries]] predominate over manufacturing.
* The workforce is feminized.
* Financial markets are globalized.

[[Image:Rockefeller,-Frank.png|thumb|Frank Rockefeller c.1905]]

'''Franklin "Frank" Rockefeller''' (August 8, 1845 in [[Moravia (village), New York|Moravia, New York]] &amp;ndash; April 15, 1917 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]) was an American businessman and member of the prominent [[Rockefeller family]].

==Early life==
He and his younger twin sister Frances, who died young, were born on August 8, 1845 in [[Moravia (village), New York|Moravia, New York]]. They were the youngest children of con artist [[William Rockefeller Sr.|William Avery "Bill" Rockefeller]] (1810&amp;ndash;1906) and Eliza Davison (1813&amp;ndash;1889). His two older brothers were [[Standard Oil]] co-founders [[John D. Rockefeller|John Davison Rockefeller]] (1839&amp;ndash;1937) and [[William Rockefeller|William Avery Rockefeller Jr.]] (1841&amp;ndash;1922).

Rockefeller's early years were spent in [[Richford, New York]]. With his father, he removed to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], which would be the home base of his business endeavors.

==Career==
In September 1861, while still underage, he joined the [[7th Ohio Infantry]] and participated as an infantryman in the battles of Winchester, Port Republic, Cedar Mountain, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Lookout Mountain, and other battles including Sherman's march to Atlanta. He was wounded in the head by grape shot at Chancellorsville.&lt;ref&gt;Itinerary of the Seventh Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Edited and Compiled by Lawrence Wilson, The Neale Company, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He held various jobs in Cleveland, eventually becoming involved in his brothers' Standard Oil Co. Frank became one of the principal promoters of the company, and later served as its Vice President. However, Rockefeller fell out with his brothers and left Standard Oil in 1898. The rift was caused by [[John Davison Rockefeller|John D.]] not taking consideration of Frank's other interests in the Pioneer Oil Company, and quarrels with Frank's partner, James Corrigan, with whom he owned the Franklin Mine near Lake Superior. He moved with his family to a large ranch in [[Kansas]], but he later returned to [[Ohio]]. The 8,000-acre ranch stood on a large tract of cheap land in [[Belvidere, Kansas]], west of [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] (originally spotted by his father on his travels). The property was remote from railroads, and his cattle could graze on vast, unfenced plains. Eventually the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad]] brought in fresh settlers shrinking the free range for cattlemen. This ruined the ranch for breeding beef, and Frank tried futilely to sell the depreciated property.

Frank formed a business relationship with [[Feargus B. Squire]] and [[Herman Frasch]], acquiring a three-tenths interest in the [[Frasch Process]].  All three then entered into a 50-50 agreement with the American Sulphur Company to form the [[Union Sulphur Company]].&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haynes |first1=Williams |title=Brimstone, The Stone That Burns |date=1959 |publisher=D. Van Norstrand Company, Inc. |location=Princeton |pages=37-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank was not as suited to business as his brothers. He invested around $500,000 in mining ventures, which proved unsound, and also invested $250,000 in unfruitful commercial paper. Frank found stability when he invested in the [[Buckeye Steel Castings|Buckeye Steel Castings Company of Columbus]] in 1892. He became President of the company in 1905, and served in that capacity until 1908, when the Presidency was assumed by [[Samuel P. Bush|Samuel Prescott Bush]]. Frank Rockefeller continued as Vice President of the company.

Frank Rockefeller refused to speak to his brothers John and William Jr. until his death, despite William attempting reconciliation in the summer of 1916. Frank said later that year "There's not the slightest possibility of a reconciliation." Frank died the following year. His funeral was held on April 17, 1917 at the home of Mrs. Walter S. Bowler. The funeral was attended by his brothers, John and William, the former being described in the press as "looking tired and careworn."

'''Froth flotation''' is a process for selectively separating [[hydrophobic]] materials from [[hydrophilic]]. This is used in mineral processing, [[paper recycling]] and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century. It has been described as "the single most important operation used for the recovery and upgrading of [[Sulfide#Geology|sulfide ores]]".&lt;ref&gt;G J Jameson, "Flotation cell development," in: ''The AusIMM Annual Conference, Broken Hill, New South Wales, 17–21 May 1992'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1992), 25–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[froth]] flotation has improved the recovery of valuable [[minerals]], such as [[copper]]- and [[lead]]-bearing minerals. Along with mechanized mining, it has allowed the economic recovery of valuable metals from much lower grade ore than previously.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
Descriptions of the use of a flotation process have been found in ancient Greek and Persian literature suggesting its antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Michael|title=”From 10 Cubic Feet to 500 Cubic Meters--Observations on 100 Years of Flotation Technology"|journal=Separation Technologies book edited by Courtney Young et al|date=2012|pages=539-546|publisher=Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late nineteenth century, the process basics were discovered through a slow evolutionary phase; then, during the first decade of the twentieth century, a more rapid investigation of oils, froths, and agitation led to proven work-place applications, especially at Broken Hill, Australia, that brought the technological innovation known as “froth flotation.”  During the early twentieth century, it truly and dramatically revolutionized -- an overworked term, but accurate here -- mineral processing around the globe.

Initially, naturally occurring chemicals such as [[fatty acid]]s and oils were used as flotation [[reagent]]s in a large quantity to increase the hydrophobicity of the valuable minerals. Since then, the process has been adapted and applied to a wide variety of materials to be separated, and additional collector agents, including [[surfactants]] and synthetic compounds have been adopted for various applications.

Englishman William Haynes patented a process in 1860 for separating [[sulfide]] and [[gangue]] minerals using oil.  Later writers have pointed to Haynes's as the first "bulk oil flotation" patent, though there is no evidence of its ever being field tested, let alone used commercially.  While in 1877 the brothers Bessel (Adolph and August) of Dresden, Germany, introduced their commercially successful oil and froth flotation process for extracting [[graphite]], considered by some the root of froth flotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nguyen|first1=Ahn|title=Colloidal Science of Flotation|date=2003|isbn=0824747828|pages=11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because the Bessel process was used on graphite not gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, etc, their work has been ignored by most historians of the technology. Seventy-seven year old inventor Hezekiah Bradford of Philadelphia imitated their work and patented a similar process in 1885.  He had received his first patent in 1834, primarily invented machinery to separate slate from coal during the 1850s-1860s, and perfected the Bradford Breaker, still in use by the coal industry today, but it is uncertain if his 1885 patented "flotation" process was successfully introduced in the graphite deposits in nearby Chester County, Pennsylvania.

In 1885 [[Carrie Everson]] patented a process calling for oil[s] but also an acid or a salt, a significant step in the evolution of the process history.  By 1890, tests of the Everson process had been made at Georgetown and Silver Cliff, Colorado, and Baker, Oregon.  She abandoned the work with the death of her husband, and before perfecting a commercial successful process.  Later, during the height of legal disputes over the validity or not of various patents during the 1910s, Everson's was often pointed to as the initial flotation patent -- which would have meant that the process was not patentable again by later contestants.  Much confusion has been clarified recently by historian Dawn Bunyak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunyak|first1=Dawn|title=The Inventor, the Patent, and Carrie Everson: Defining Success|journal=Mining History Journal|date=2005|pages=9-24|url=https://www.mininghistoryassociation.org/Journal/MHJ-v12-2005-Bunyak.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First commercial flotation process ===
The generally recognized first successful commercial flotation process for ''mineral'' [[Sulfide|sulphides]] was invented by Frank Elmore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maelgwyn.com/birthplaceflotation.html#top|accessdate=2010-01-13|title=Wales - The birthplace of Flotation}}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked on the development with his brother, Stanley. The Glasdir copper mine at [[Llanelltyd]], near [[Dolgellau]] in [[North Wales]] was bought in 1896 by the Elmore brothers in conjunction with their father, William. In 1897, the Elmore brothers installed the world's first industrial size commercial flotation process for mineral beneficiation at the Glasdir mine. The process was not froth flotation but used oil to agglomerate (make balls of) pulverised sulphides and [[Buoyancy|buoy]] them to the surface, and was patented in 1898 with a description of the process published in 1903 in the ''Engineering and Mining Journal''. By this time they had recognized the importance of air bubbles in assisting the oil to carry away the mineral particles. The Elmores had formed a company known as the Ore Concentration Syndicate Ltd to promote the commercial use of the process worldwide. Charles Butters of Berkeley, California, acquired American rights to Elmores' process, and developed what was known to contemporaries as the "Butters Process".  Butters, an expert on the [[Gold cyanidation|cyanide process]], tried lab test of the Elmore process on gold ores without success. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rickard|first=Thomas A.|title=Interviews with Mining Engineers|year=1922|publisher=Mining and Scientific Press|location=San Francisco|pages=119–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However developments elsewhere, particularly in [[Broken Hill, Australia]] by [[Minerals Separation, Limited]], led to decades of hard fought legal battles and litigations which, ultimately, were lost as the Elmore process was superseded by more advanced techniques. Another flotation process was independently invented in the early 1900s in Australia by Charles Vincent Potter and around the same time by [[Guillaume Daniel Delprat]].&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last=Osborne |first=Graeme |id2=delprat-guillaume-daniel-5947 |title=Guillaume Daniel Delprat |year=1981 |accessdate= 7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/guides/mine/historicalnote.htm|title=Historical Note|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=Minerals Separation Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process (developed circa 1902) did not use oil, but relied upon flotation by the generation of gas formed by the introduction of acid into the pulp. In 1902, Froment combined oil and gaseous flotation using a modification of the Potter-Delprat process.  During the first decade of the twentieth century, Broken Hill became the center of innovation leading to the perfection of the froth flotation process by many technologists there borrowing from each other and building on these first successes.

Yet another process was developed in 1902 by Cattermole, who emulsified the pulp with a small quantity of oil, subjected it to violent agitation, then slow stirring which coagulated the target minerals into nodules which were separated from the pulp by gravity. The Minerals Separation Ltd., formed in Britain in 1903 to acquire the Cattermole patent, found that it proved unsuccessful.  Metallurgists on the staff continued to test and combine other discoveries to patent in 1905 their process, called the Sulman-Picard-Ballot process after company officers and patentees. The process proved successful at their Central Block plant, Broken Hill that year.  Significant in their "agitation froth flotation" process was the use of less than 1% oil and an agitation step that created small bubbles, which provided more surface to capture the metal and float into to a froth at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malozemoff|first1=Plato|title=“Operating Characteristics of Mechanical Flotation Machines,”|journal=Engineering &amp; Mining Journal|date=March 1941|page=45-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mineral Separation also bought other patents to consolidate ownership of any potential conflicting rights to the flotation process--except for the Elmore patents.  In 1910, when the Zinc Corporation replaced its Elmore process with the Minerals Separation (Sulman-Picard-Ballot) froth flotation process at its Broken Hill plant, the primacy of the Minerals Separation over other process contenders was assured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mouat|first1=Jeremy|title=The Development of the Flotation Process: Technological Change and the Genesis of Modern Mining, 1898-1911|journal=Australian Economic Review|date=March 1996|volume=36|issue=1|pages=3-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry Livingston Sulman was later recognized by his peers in his election as President of the British Institution of Mining and Metallurgy, which also awarded him its gold medal. 

=== 1900s ===
Developments in the United States had been less than spectacular.  Butters's failures, as well as others, was followed after 1904, with Scotsman Stanley MacQuisten's process (a surface tension based method), which was developed with a [[modicum]] of success in Nevada and Idaho, but this would not work when [[Tailings|slimes]] were present, a major fault.  Henry E. Wood of Denver had developed his flotation process along the same lines in 1907, patented 1911, with some success on molybdenum ores.  For the most part, however, these were isolated attempts without fanfare for what can only be called marginal successes.  

In 1911, [[James M. Hyde]], a former employee of Minerals Separation, Ltd., modified the Minerals Separation process and installed a test plant in the Butte and Superior Mill in [[Basin, Montana]], the first such installation in the USA.  In 1912, he designed the Butte &amp; Superior zinc works, Butte, Montana, the first great flotation plant in America.&lt;ref&gt;Callow; 1916&lt;/ref&gt;  Minerals Separation, Ltd., which had set up an office in San Francisco, sued Hyde for infringement as well as the Butte &amp; Superior company, both cases were eventually won by the firm in the U. S. Supreme Court.  [[Daniel Cowan Jackling]] and partners, who controlled Butte &amp; Superior, also refuted the Minerals Separation patent and funded the ensuing legal battles that lasted over a decade.  They -- Utah Copper (Kennecott), Nevada Consolidated, Chino Copper, Ray Con and other Jackling firms -- eventually settled, in 1922, paying a substantial fee for licenses to use the Minerals Separation process.  One unfortunate result of the dispute was professional divisiveness among the mining engineering community for a generation.

In 1913, the Minerals Separation paid for a test plant for the Inspiration Copper Company at Miami, Arizona.  Built under the San Francisco office director, Edward Nutter, it proved a success.  Inspiration engineer [[L. D. Ricketts]] ripped out a gravity concentration mill and replaced it with the Minerals Separation process, the first major use of the process at an American copper mine.  A major holder of Inspiration stock were men who controlled the great Anaconda mine of Butte.  They immediately followed the Inspiration success to build a Minerals Separation licensed plant at Butte, in 1915-1916, a major statement about the final acceptance of the Minerals Separation patented process.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parsons|first1=A. B.|title=The Porphyry Coppers|date=1933|publisher=American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers|location=New York|pages=239-246, 446-450}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

John M. Callow, of General Engineering of [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], had followed flotation from technical papers and the introduction in both the Butte and Superior Mill, and at Inspiration Copper in Arizona and determined that mechanical agitation was a drawback to the existing technology. Introducing a porous brick with compressed air, and a mechanical stirring mechanism, Callow applied for a patent in 1914 (some say that Callow, a Jackling partisan, invented his cell as a means to avoid paying royalties to Minerals Separation, which firms using his cell eventually were forced to do by the courts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rickard|first=Thomas A.|title=Interviews with Mining Engineers|year=1922|publisher=Mining and Scientific Press|location=San Francisco|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method, known as Pneumatic Flotation, was recognized as an alternative to the Minerals Separation process of flotation concentration.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed description of the history of flotation and this process can be found in Callows "Notes on Flotation" found in the ''Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers''; Vol 53-54, originally presented in New York in February 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Institute of Mining Engineers]] presented Callow the James Douglas Gold Medal in 1926 for his contributions to the field of flotation.  By that time, flotation technology was changing, especially with the discovery of the use of xanthates and other reagents, which made the Callow cell and his process obsolete.

Montana Tech professor [[Antoine Marc Gaudin]] defined the early period of flotation as the mechanical phase while by the late 1910s it entered the chemical phase.  Discoveries in reagents, especially the use of xanthates patented by Minerals Separations chemist Cornelius H. Keller, not so much increased the capture of minerals through the process as making it far more manageable in day to day operations.  Minerals Separation's initial flotation patents ended 1923, and new ones for chemical processes gave it a significant position into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaudin,|first1=A. M.|title=Flotation|date=1932|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period the company also developed and patented flotation processes for iron out of its Hibbing lab and of phosphate in its Florida lab.  Another rapid phase of flotation process innovation did not occur until after 1960.

In the 1960s the froth flotation technique was adapted for [[deinking]] [[recycled paper]].

The success of the process is evinced by the number of claimants as "discoverers" of flotation.  In 1961, American engineers celebrated "50 years of flotation" and enshrined James Hyde and his Butte &amp; Superior mill.  In 1977, German engineers celebrated the "hundredth anniversary of flotation" based on the brothers Bessel patent of 1877.  The historic Glasdir copper mine site advertises its tours in Wales as site of the "discovery of flotation" based upon the Elmore brothers work.  Recent writers, because of the interest in celebrating women in science, champion Carrie Everson of Denver as mother of the process based on her 1885 patent.  Omitted from this list are the engineers, metallurgists and chemists of Minerals Separation, Ltd., which, at least in the American and Australian courts, won control of froth flotation patents as well as right of claimant as discoverers of froth flotation.  But, as historian Martin Lynch writes, "Mineral Separation would eventually prevail after taking the case to the US Supreme Court [and the House of Lords], and in so doing earned for itself the cordial detestation of many in the mining world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lynch |first1=Martin |title=Mining in World History |date=2002 |publisher=Reaktion Press |location=London |isbn=978-1-86189-173-0 |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Froth flotation is a process for separating minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their [[hydrophobicity]]. Hydrophobicity differences between valuable minerals and waste gangue are increased through the use of surfactants and wetting agents. The selective separation of the minerals makes processing complex (that is, mixed) ores economically feasible. The flotation process is used for the separation of a large range of [[sulfide]]s, [[carbonate]]s and [[oxide]]s prior to further refinement. [[Phosphates]] and [[coal]] are also upgraded (purified) by flotation technology.

Prior to 1907, nearly all the copper mined in the US came from underground vein deposits, averaging 2.5 percent copper.&lt;ref name = "Wills"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wills | first1 = B A | last2 = Atkinson | first2 = K | year = 1991 | title = The development of minerals engineering in the 20th Century | url = | journal = Minerals Engineering | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 643–652 | doi=10.1016/0892-6875(91)90054-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1991, the average grade of copper ore mined in the US had fallen to only 0.6 percent.&lt;ref name = "Wills"/&gt;

===Waste water treatment===
The [[Continuous foam separation|flotation process]] is also widely used in industrial waste water treatment plants, where it removes fats, oil, grease and suspended solids from waste water. These units are called [[dissolved air flotation]] (DAF) units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]| edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. | year=1967 | id=[[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, dissolved air flotation units are used in removing oil from the wastewater [[effluent]]s of [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s, [[Natural gas processing|natural gas processing plants]] and similar industrial facilities.

===Paper recycling===
{{Main article|Deinking}}
Froth flotation is one of the processes used to recover [[recycled paper]]. In the [[paper industry]] this step is called deinking or just flotation. The target is to release and remove the hydrophobic contaminants from the recycled paper. The contaminants are mostly [[printing ink]] and [[Stickies (papermaking)|stickies]]. Normally the setup is a two-stage system with 3,4 or 5 flotation cells in series.&lt;ref&gt;Voith EcoCell flotation plant {{cite web |url=http://www.voithpaper.com/applications/productsearch/files/594_VPR-PB-07-0001-GB-07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824075218/http://www.voithpaper.com/applications/productsearch/files/594_VPR-PB-07-0001-GB-07.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of operation==
Before froth flotation can work, the ore to be treated is reduced to fine particles by crushing and grinding (a process known as [[comminution]]) so that the various minerals exist as physically separate grains. This process is known as ''liberation''. The particle sizes are typically less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm (100&amp;nbsp;µm), but sometimes sizes smaller than 7–10&amp;nbsp;µm are required.&lt;ref&gt;D N Nihill, C M Stewart and P Bowen, "The McArthur River mine—the first years of operation," in: ''AusIMM ’98 – The Mining Cycle, Mount Isa, 19–23 April 1998'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1998), 73–82.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tendency for the liberation size of the minerals to decrease over time as the ore bodies with coarse mineral grains that can be separated at larger sizes are depleted and replaced by ore bodies that were formerly considered too difficult.

In the mining industry, the plants where flotation is undertaken to concentrate [[ore]] are generally known as ''concentrators'' or ''mills''.

For froth flotation, the ground ore is mixed with water to form a [[slurry]] and the desired mineral is rendered hydrophobic by the addition of a surfactant or ''collector'' chemical (although some mineral surfaces are naturally hydrophobic,&lt;ref&gt;E V Manlapig, C Green, J W Parkinson and A S Murphy, "The technology and economic incentives for recovering coal from tailings impoundments," ''SME Annual Meeting, Denver, Colorado, 26–28 February 2001, Preprint 01-70'' (Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration: Littleton, Colorado, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; requiring little or no addition of collector). The particular chemical depends on the nature of the mineral to be recovered and, perhaps, the natures of those that are not wanted. As an example, [[sodium ethyl xanthate]] may be added as a collector in the selective flotation of [[galena]] (lead sulfide) to separate it from [[sphalerite]] (zinc sulfide). This slurry (more properly called the ''pulp'') of hydrophobic particles and hydrophilic particles is then introduced to tanks known as ''flotation cells'' that are aerated to produce bubbles. The hydrophobic particles attach to the air bubbles, which rise to the surface, forming a froth.&lt;ref name="linmahanglead" /&gt; The froth is removed from the cell, producing a concentrate ("con") of the target mineral.

Frothing agents, known as ''frothers'', may be introduced to the pulp to promote the formation of a stable froth on top of the flotation cell.

The minerals that do not float into the froth are referred to as the ''flotation tailings'' or ''flotation tails''. These tailings may also be subjected to further stages of flotation to recover the valuable particles that did not float the first time. This is known as ''scavenging''. The final tailings after scavenging are normally pumped for disposal as mine fill or to tailings disposal facilities for long-term storage.

Froth flotation efficiency is determined by a series of probabilities: those of particle–bubble contact, particle–bubble attachment, transport between the pulp and the froth, and froth collection into the product launder.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson 1993"&gt;B W Atkinson, C J Conway and G J Jameson, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Fundamentals%20of%20Jameson%20Cell%20Operation%20including%20Size-Yield%20Respone%20-%20Atkinson%20Conway%20Jameson.pdf "Fundamentals of Jameson Cell operation including size–yield response,"] in: ''Sixth Australian Coal Preparation Conference, Mackay, Queensland, 6–9 September 1993'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In a conventional mechanically-agitated cell, the void fraction (i.e. volume occupied by air bubbles) is low (5 to 10 percent) and the bubble size is usually greater than 1&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson 1995"/&gt; This results in a relatively low interfacial area and a low probability of particle–bubble contact.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson 1995"&gt;B W Atkinson, C J Conway and G J Jameson, "High-efficiency flotation of coarse and fine coal," in: ''High-efficiency Coal Preparation: An International Symposium,'' (Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration: Littleton, Colorado, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, several cells in series are required to increase the particle residence time, thus increasing the probability of particle–bubble contact.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson 1995"/&gt;

Flotation is normally undertaken in several stages to maximize the recovery of the target mineral or minerals and the concentration of those minerals in the concentrate, while minimizing the energy input.&lt;ref name = "Pease"&gt;J Pease, "[http://www.isamill.com/EN/Downloads/Downloaded%20Technical%20Papers/Joe_Pease.pdf Increasing the energy efficiency of grinding]," Presented at: ''Crushing and Grinding, Brisbane, September 2007.'' Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flotation stages===

====Roughing====
The first stage is called ''roughing'', which produces a ''rougher concentrate''. The objective is to remove the maximum amount of the valuable mineral at as coarse a particle size as practical.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; The finer an ore is ground, the greater the energy that is required, so it makes sense to fine grind only those particles that need fine grinding.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; Complete liberation is not required for rougher flotation, only sufficient liberation to release enough gangue from the valuable mineral to get a high recovery.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt;

The primary objective of roughing is to recover as much of the valuable minerals as possible, with less emphasis on the quality of the concentrate produced.

In some concentrators, there may be a ''preflotation'' step that precedes roughing.&lt;ref name = "Smith"&gt;T Smith, D Lin, B Lacouture and G Anderson, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Removal%20of%20Organic%20Carbon%20with%20a%20Jameson%20Cell%20at%20R.pdf "Removal of organic carbon with a Jameson Cell at Red Dog Mine,"] in: ''Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Ottawa, Ontario, 22–24 January 2008''. Accessed 6 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is done when there are some undesirable materials, such as organic carbon, that readily float.&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt; They are removed first to avoid them floating during roughing (and thus contaminating the rougher concentrate).

====Cleaning====
The rougher concentrate is normally subjected to further stages of flotation to reject more of the undesirable minerals that also reported to the froth, in a process known as ''cleaning''.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; The product of cleaning is known as the ''cleaner concentrate'' or the ''final concentrate''.

The objective of cleaning is to produce as high a concentrate grade as possible.

The rougher concentrate is often subject to further grinding (usually called ''regrinding'') to get more complete liberation of the valuable minerals.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; Because it is a smaller mass than that of the original ore, less energy is needed than would be necessary if the whole ore were reground.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; Regrinding is often undertaken in specialized ''regrind mills'', such as the [[IsaMill]], designed to further reduce the energy consumed during regrinding to finer sizes.

====Scavenging====
The rougher flotation step is often followed by a ''scavenger'' flotation step that is applied to the rougher tailings. The objective is to recover any of the target minerals that were not recovered during the initial roughing stage. This might be achieved by changing the flotation conditions to make them more rigorous than the initial roughing, or there might be some secondary grinding to provide further liberation.

The concentrate from the rougher scavengers could be returned to the rougher feed for refloating or sent to special cleaner cells.

Similarly, the cleaning step may also be followed by a scavenging step performed on the cleaner tailings.

==Science of flotation==
To be effective on a given ore slurry, the collectors are chosen based upon their selective [[wetting]] of the types of particles to be separated.  A good collector will [[adsorb]], physically or chemically, with one of the types of particles. This provides the thermodynamic requirement for the particles to bind to the surface of a bubble.  The wetting activity of a surfactant on a particle can be quantified by measuring the [[contact angle]]s that the liquid/bubble interface makes with it. Another important measure for attachment of bubbles to particles is induction time. The induction time is the time required for the particle and bubble to rupture the thin film separating the particle and bubble. This rupturing is achieved by the surface forces between the particle and bubble.

The mechanisms for the bubble-particle attachment is very complex and consists of three steps, collision, attachment and detachment. The collision is achieved by particles being within the collision tube of a bubble and this is affected by the velocity of the bubble and radius of the bubble. The collision tube corresponds to the region in which a particle will collide with the bubble, with the perimeter of the collision tube corresponding to the grazing trajectory.

The attachment of the particle to the bubble is controlled by the induction time of the particle and bubble. The particle and bubble need to bind and this occurs if the time in which the particle and bubble are in contact with each other is larger than the required induction time. This induction time is affected by the fluid viscosity, particle and bubble size and the forces between the particle and bubbles.

The detachment of a particle and bubble occurs when the force exerted by the surface tension is exceeded by shear forces and gravitational forces. These forces are complex and vary within the cell. High shear will be experienced close to the impeller of a mechanical flotation cell and mostly gravitational force in the collection and cleaning zone of a flotation column.

Significant issues of entrainment of fine particles occurs as these particles experience low collision efficiencies as well as sliming and degradation of the particle surfaces. Coarse particles show a low recovery of the valuable mineral due to the low liberation and high detachment efficiencies.

===Theory===

====Selective adhesion====
Froth flotation depends on the selective adhesion of air bubbles to mineral surfaces in a mineral/water slurry. The air bubbles will attach to more [[hydrophobic]] particles. The attachment of the bubbles to the surface is determined by the interfacial energies between the solid, liquid, and gas phases. This is determined by the [[wetting|Young-Dupré Equation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kawatra|first1=S.K.|title=Flotation Fundamentals|url=http://www.chem.mtu.edu/chem_eng/faculty/kawatra/Flotation_Fundamentals.pdf|website=MTU Chemistry|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{lv} \text{cos} \theta = (\gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl})&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* γ&lt;sub&gt;lv&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface energy of the liquid/vapor interface
* γ&lt;sub&gt;sv&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface energy of the solid/vapor interface
* γ&lt;sub&gt;sl&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface energy of the solid/liquid interface,
* θ is the [[contact angle]], the angle formed at the junction between vapor, solid, and liquid phases.

Minerals targeted for separation may be chemically surface-modified with collectors so that they are more hydrophobic. Collectors are a type of [[surfactant]] that increase the natural hydrophobicity of the surface, increasing the [[Separation process|separability]] of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles. Collectors either chemically bond via [[chemisorption]] to the mineral or adsorb onto the surface via [[physisorption]].

[[File:Collectors.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Different types of collectors, or surfactants, used in froth flotation.]]

====IMFs and surface forces in bubble-particle interactions====

=====Collision=====
The collision rates for fine particles (50 - 80 μm) can be accurately modeled, but there is no current theory that accurately models bubble-particle collision for particles as large as 300 μm, which are commonly used in flotation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=Anh V|title=On modelling of bubble–particle attachment probability in flotation|journal=International Journal of Mineral Processing|date=12 June 1996|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301751697000732|doi=10.1016/S0301-7516(97)00073-2|volume=53|pages=225–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For fine particles, [[Stokes' law|Stokes law]] underestimates collision probability while the potential equation based on [[surface charge]] overestimates collision probability so an intermediate equation is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shahbazi|first1=B.|title=Bubble–particle collision and attachment probability on fine particles flotation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0255270110001029|journal=Chemical Engineering and Processing: Process Intensification|doi=10.1016/j.cep.2010.04.009|volume=49|pages=622–627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to know the collision rates in the system since this step precedes the adsorption where a three phase system is formed.

=====Adsorption (attachment)=====
The effectiveness of a medium to adsorb to a particle is influenced by the relationship between the surfaces of both materials. There are multiple factors that affect the efficiency of adsorption in chemical, thermodynamic, and physical domains. These factors can range from surface energy and polarity to the shape, size, and roughness of the particle. In froth flotation, adsorption is a strong consequence of surface energy, since the small particles have a high surface area to size ratio, resulting in higher energy surfaces to form attractions with adsorbates. The air bubbles must selectively adhere to the desired minerals to elevate them to the surface of the slurry while wetting the other minerals and leaving them in the aqueous slurry medium.

Particles that can be easily wetted by water are called hydrophilic, while particles that are not easily wetted by water are called hydrophobic. Hydrophobic particles have a tendency to form a separate phase in aqueous media. In froth flotation the effectiveness of an air bubble to adhere to a particle is based on how hydrophobic the particle is. Hydrophobic particles have an affinity to air bubbles, leading to adsorption. The bubble-particle combinations are elevated to the froth zone driven by buoyancy forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kawatra|first1=S.K.|title=Flotation Fundamentals|url=http://www.chem.mtu.edu/chem_eng/faculty/kawatra/Flotation_Fundamentals.pdf|website=MTU Chemistry|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attachment of the bubbles to the particles is determined by the interfacial energies of between the solid, liquid, and vapor phases, as modeled by the Young/Dupre Equation. The interfacial energies can be based on the natural structure of the materials, or the addition of chemical treatments can improve energy compatibility.

Collectors are the main additives used to improve particle surfaces. They function as surfactants to selectively isolate and aid adsorption between the particles of interest and bubbles rising through the slurry. Common collectors used in flotation are anionic sulfur ligands, which have a bifunctional structure with an ionic portion which shares attraction with metals, and a hydrophobic portion such as a long hydrocarbon tail. These collectors coat a particle’s surface with a monolayer of non-polar substance to aid separation from the aqueous phase by decreasing the adsorbed particle solubility in water. The adsorbed ligands can form micelles around the particles and form small-particle colloids improving stability and phase separation further.

=====Desorption (detachment)=====
The adsorption of particles to bubbles is essential to separating the minerals from the slurry, but the minerals must be purified from the additives used in separation, such as the collectors, frothers, and modifiers. The product of the cleaning, or desorption process, is known as the cleaner concentrate. 
The detachment of a particle and bubble requires adsorption bond cleavage driven by shear forces. Depending on the flotation cell type, shear forces are applied by a variety of mechanical systems. Among the most common are impellers and mixers. Some systems combine the functionalities of these components by placing them at key locations where they can take part in multiple froth flotation mechanisms. Cleaning cells also take advantage of gravitational forces to improve separation efficiency.

====Performance calculations====

=====Relevant equations=====
A common quantity used to describe the collection efficiency of a froth flotation process is ''flotation recovery'' (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;). This quantity incorporates the probabilities of [[Froth flotation#Science of flotation|collision]] and [[Froth flotation#Science of flotation|attachment]] of particles to gas flotation bubbles.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{N_c} {\left(\tfrac{\pi}{4}\right)\left(d_p+d_b\right)^2 Hc}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
where:
* &lt;math&gt;N_c = PN_c^i&lt;/math&gt;, which is the product of the probability of the particle being collected (&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;) and the number of possible particle collisions (&lt;math&gt;N_c^i&lt;/math&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;d_p&lt;/math&gt; is particle diameter
* &lt;math&gt;d_b&lt;/math&gt; is bubble diameter
* &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a specified height within the flotation which the recovery was calculated
* &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the particle concentration
&lt;br /&gt;
The following, are several additional mathematical methods often used to evaluate the effectiveness of froth flotation processes. These equations are more simple than the calculation for ''flotation recovery'', as they are based solely on the amounts of inputs and outputs of the processes.&lt;ref&gt;Kawatra, S. K.

=====Grade-recovery curves=====

Grade-recovery curves are useful tools in weighing the trade-off of producing a high grade of concentrate while maintaining as low of a recovery rate as possible, two important aspects of froth flotation. These curves are developed empirically based on the individual froth flotation process of a particular plant. As the curves are shifted in the positive x-direction (to the right) and the positive y-direction (upward) the performance of the froth flotation process is regarded as improving. A disadvantage to these curves is that they can only compare the grade-recovery relations of a specific feed grade and feed rate. If a company has a variance of feed grades and rates used (an extremely common occurrence) in their froth flotation process, grade-recovery curves for every pairing of feed grade and recovery rate would have to be constructed in order to provide meaningful information to the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Neethling, S.j., and J.j. Cilliers. "Grade-recovery Curves: A New Approach for Analysis of and Predicting from Plant Data." ''Minerals Engineering'' 36-38 (2012): 105-10. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flotation equipment ==
[[Image:FlCell.PNG|thumb|240px|right|Diagram of froth flotation cell. Numbered triangles show direction of stream flow.  A mixture of ore and water called pulp [1] enters the cell from a conditioner, and flows to the bottom of the cell.  Air [2] or nitrogen is passed down a vertical impeller where shearing forces break the air stream into small bubbles.  The mineral concentrate froth is collected from the top of the cell [3], while the pulp [4] flows to another cell.]]

Flotation can be performed in rectangular or cylindrical mechanically agitated cells or tanks, flotation columns, [[Jameson Cell]]s or deinking flotation machines. Classified by the method of air absorption manner, it is fair to state that two distinct groups of flotation equipments have arisen:pneumatic and mechanical machines. Generally pneumatic machines give a low-grade concentrate and little operating troubles.
[[File:Jameson Cells pictured adjacent to flotation columns at the Mount Isa lead-zinc concentrator.png|thumbnail|left|Comparison of the sizes of flotation columns and [[Jameson Cell]]s with similar capacities.]]

Mechanical cells use a large mixer and diffuser mechanism at the bottom of the mixing tank to introduce air and provide mixing action.  '''Flotation columns''' use air [[Sparging (chemistry)|sparger]]s to introduce air at the bottom of a tall column while introducing slurry above.  The countercurrent motion of the slurry flowing down and the air flowing up provides mixing action.  Mechanical cells generally have a higher throughput rate, but produce material that is of lower quality, while flotation columns generally have a low throughput rate but produce higher quality material.

The Jameson cell uses neither impellers nor spargers, instead combining the slurry with air in a downcomer where high shear creates the turbulent conditions required for bubble particle contacting.

== Mechanics of flotation ==
[[Image:FlCirc.PNG|thumb|300px|right]]
The following steps are followed, following grinding to liberate the mineral particles:
# Reagent conditioning to achieve hydrophobic surface charges on the desired particles
# Collection and upward transport by bubbles in an intimate contact with air or nitrogen
# Formation of a stable froth on the surface of the flotation cell
# Separation of the mineral laden froth from the bath (flotation cell)

'''Simple flotation circuit for mineral concentration.'''  Numbered triangles show direction of stream flow.  Various flotation reagents are added to a mixture of ore and water (called pulp) in a conditioning tank.  The flow rate and tank size are designed to give the minerals enough time to be activated.  The conditioner pulp [1] is fed to a bank of rougher cells which remove most of the desired minerals as a concentrate.  The rougher pulp [2] passes to a bank of scavenger cells where additional reagents may be added.  The scavenger cell froth [3] is usually returned to the rougher cells for additional treatment, but in some cases may be sent to special cleaner cells.  The scavenger pulp is usually barren enough to be discarded as tails.  More complex flotation circuits have several sets of cleaner and re-cleaner cells, and intermediate re-grinding of pulp or concentrate.

== Chemicals of flotation ==
[[File:Prominenthill-flotation.jpg|thumb|Copper sulfide foam in a froth-flotation cell]]
&lt;!-- sodiumn hydrate is of significant value to this separation process. In what role?--&gt;

===Water===

===Collectors===
For many ores (e.g. those of Cu, Mo, W, Ni), the collectors are anionic sulfur ligands.  Particularly popular are [[xanthate]] salts, including potassium amyl xanthate (PAX), potassium isobutyl xanthate (PIBX), [[potassium ethyl xanthate]] (KEX), [[sodium isobutyl xanthate]] (SIBX), [[sodium isopropyl xanthate]] (SIPX), [[sodium ethyl xanthate]] (SEX).  Other collectors include related sulfur-based ligands: [[dithiophosphate]]s, [[dithiocarbamate]]s.  Still other classes of collectors include the [[thiourea]] [[thiocarbanilide]].  [[Fatty acid]]s have also been used.

For some minerals (e.g., [[sylvanite]] for KCl), [[fatty amine]]s are used as collectors.

===Frothers===
A variety of compounds are added to stabilize the foams.  These additives include [[pine oil]], various [[alcohol]]s ([[4-Methyl-2-pentanol|methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC)]]), [[Polyethylene glycol|polyglycols]], [[xylenol]] (cresylic acid).

===Modifiers===
A variety of other compounds are added to optimize the separation process, these additives are called modifiers.  Such species do not interact directly with the mineral, but modify the physical properties of the solution.
* [[pH]] modifiers include [[Calcium oxide|lime]] (CaO), [[sodium carbonate|Soda ash]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Sodium hydroxide|Caustic soda]] (NaOH), [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[hydrochloric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, HCl).
&lt;!--seem improbable or specialized*[[Cation]]ic modifiers: Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;--&gt;
* [[Anion]]ic modifiers include phosphates, silicates, and carbonates.
* Organic modifiers include the thickeners [[dextrin]], [[starch]], [[glue]], and [[carboxymethyl cellulose|CMC]].

===Chemical compounds for deinking of recycled paper===
* pH control: [[sodium silicate]] and [[sodium hydroxide]]
* [[Calcium]] [[ion]] source: [[hard water]], [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] or [[calcium chloride]]
* Collector: [[fatty acid]], fatty acid [[emulsion]], fatty acid [[soap]] and/or organo-modified [[siloxane]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent | inventor-last = Nellesen | inventor-first = Bernhard | inventor2-last = Northfleet | inventor2-first = Christina | publication-date = 05.02.2004 | year = 2004 | title = METHOD OF DEINKING | country-code = WO | patent-number = 011717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific ore applications ==
Illustrative, the flotation process is used for purification of [[potassium chloride]] from [[sodium chloride]] and clay minerals.  The crushed mineral is suspended in brine in the presence of [[fatty amine|fatty ammonium]] salts.  Because the ammonium group and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; have very similar ionic radii (ca. 0.135, 0.143&amp;nbsp;nm respectively), the ammonium centers exchange for the surface potassium sites on the particles of KCl, but not on the NaCl particles.  The long [[alkyl]] chains then confer hydrophobicity, to the particles, which enable them to form foams.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Elizabeth R.

'''Georgi Ivanov Naydenov''' ({{lang-bg|Георги Иванов Найденов}}) (born July 19, 1927 – October 3, 1998) was a [[Bulgaria]]n [[businessman]] and [[bank]]er who was born in the small town of [[Strelcha]], and became famous during the 1960s as the creator of the unique and successful economic experiment [[Texim]].

== The Economic Group ==
The idea of Texim as an independent organization within the Bulgarian [[socialist economy]] originated with a starting capital of 10,000 Leva (1 Dollar at that time was equal to around 1.17 Leva).  Yet, although Texim existed for only 8 years from 1962–1969, its legendary success has accompanied the name until this day. Eventually, the experiment expanded to comprise three main units: Texim, the [[Imextracom Establishment]], and the [[Bulgarian Trading Fleet]]. The Bulgarian Merchant Fleet included trade, [[shipbuilding]], and docks, while Texim included the first [[Coca-Cola]] establishments in the entire [[communist block]].

After the fall of communism, Naydenov created, the now oldest private bank in Bulgaria, [[Teximbank]], in September 1992, which exists to this day.

ELGHANAYAN" 190 A.D.2d 449, 453] MILONAS, J. | ''The document, which was drawn up in Farsi and signed in Teheran, provides that the four older siblings, defendants Aghadjan, Davoud, Nourollah and the late Habib Elghanayan, would each own a 20% share of the business while the three younger brothers, plaintiffs Sion, Ataollah and Nedjatollah Elghanayan, would divide among themselves the one remaining 20% share.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Elghanian established Plasco, a plastics manufacturing factory in [[Tehran]] which later became the largest and most technologically advanced plastics manufacturer in [[Iran]]. He played a significant role in bringing Western technology to Iran in the 1960s and 1970s. A self made multi-millionaire, Elghanian was known for his entrepreneurial accomplishments in Iran and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;''Eminent Persians: The Men and Women Who Made Modern Iran'', 1941-1979, Vol II, by Abbas Milani, pp. 616-621, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he served as the leader of the society in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=shahrzade/&gt;

==Arrest and execution==
Shortly after the Islamic revolution in 1979, Elghanian was arrested on March 16 after returning to Iran, and accused of spying. The charges included corruption, contacts with Israel and Zionism, and "economic imperialism". On May 8, he was tried and convicted of a number of crimes, including meeting with Israeli leaders. According to his granddaughter, the trial lasted less than twenty minutes. He was sentenced to death, with his execution carried out before dawn the next day. All of the property belonging to the Elghanian family in Iran was confiscated by the state.&lt;ref name=amnrep&gt;{{cite web|title=Law And Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran |url=http://www.ihrv.org/inf/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/law_and_human_rights_in_the_islamic_republic_of_iran_february_through_september19791.pdf |work=Amnesty International |accessdate=3 August 2013 |format=Report |date=13 March 1980 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306154652/http://ihrv.org/inf/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/law_and_human_rights_in_the_islamic_republic_of_iran_february_through_september19791.pdf |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by ''Time'' magazine states:  &lt;blockquote&gt; Elghanian, who was convicted of spying for Israel, was said to have made huge investments in Israel and to have solicited funds for the Israeli army, which the prosecution claimed made him an accomplice "in murderous air raids against innocent Palestinians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920359,00.html|newspaper=Time|title=A Nation Still in Torment| date=21 May 1979|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Elghanian stated that he was not a supporter of [[Zionism]], though his [[Plasco Building]] was built by Israeli engineers during the Shah Era when [[Iran–Israel relations#Israeli independence to Iranian revolution (1947–79)|Iran had close relations with Israel]], and he had made investments in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;''Eminent Persians: The Men and Women Who Made Modern Iran'', 1941-1979, Vol II, Abbas Milani, pp. 616-621, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 1979, Elghanian was executed by firing squad in Tehran. He was the first Jewish citizen and one of the first civilians of Iran to be executed by the new Islamic government.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sarshar|first=Houman|title=Esther's Children|year=2002|page=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
His death was considered one of the reasons for the departure of 75% of the 80,000 Jews who lived in the country before the revolution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Amid the post-revolution chaos, the government with its many rival factions initially refused to release Elghanian's body to his family for burial.{{fact|date=January 2017}} With the intervention of Chief Rabbi [[Yedidia Shofet]] and other prominent members of the Tehran Jewish community, his body was finally released and initially buried in an unmarked grave in Tehran's [[List of cemeteries in Iran|Beheshtieh Jewish Cemetery]]. Out of fear of further retaliation, only a handful of people attended Elghanian's burial. A modest tombstone was later placed on his grave making no reference to his execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Beheshtieh.com Website of the Tehran Jewish Cemetery]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Elghanian's execution, the [[United States Senate]] passed a resolution authored by [[New York (state)|New York]] [[Senator]] [[Jacob Javits]] to condemn his execution as well as that of other civilians as a violation of [[human rights in Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mousavian |last2=Shahidsaless |first1=Seyed Hossein |first2=Shahir|title=Iran and the United States: An Insider’s View on the Failed Past and the Road to Peace |url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=gZe9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT86&amp;lpg=PT86&amp;dq=United+States+condemn+Elghanian+execution&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U8h21QR855&amp;sig=vcYeol2YrCAIQCDHVOkJnsYEdZY&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFyMmtsM_RAhVEiZAKHZGyChsQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=United%20States%20condemn%20Elghanian%20execution&amp;f=false |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2014 |isbn=1628927607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Stuxnet]] worm that attacked Iran's nuclear facilities, there was speculation by security researchers working for [[Symantec]] that a number found in the Stuxnet code - "19790509"  - which was used as a marker to identify computers that should not be affected, was a reference to his execution date; however, researchers also warned against using this possible connection to draw any conclusions as to Stuxnet's origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Version 1.4, (February 2011)] Nicolas Falliere, Liam O Murchu, and Eric Chien&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heroic capitalism''' or '''dynamic capitalism''' was a concept that [[Italian Fascism]] took from [[Werner Sombart]]'s explanations of capitalist development.  This phase was known by Sombart as "Early Capitalism"&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito. ''Four speeches on the corporate state: with an appendix including the labour charter, the text of laws on syndical and corporate organisations and explanatory notes''. Laboremus, 1935. Pp. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, [[Benito Mussolini]] claimed that [[capitalism]] began with dynamic or heroic capitalism (1830-1870) followed by static capitalism (1870-1914) and then reached its final form of decadent capitalism, known also as [[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]], which began in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi. Pp. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mussolini argued that although he did not support this type of capitalism he considered it at least a dynamic and heroic form. Some Fascists, including Mussolini, considered it a contribution to the [[industrialism]] and technical developments but claimed that they did not favour the creation of supercapitalism in Italy, due to its strong agricultural sector.&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi. 2000. Pp. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini claimed that dynamic or heroic capitalism inevitably degenerates into static capitalism and then supercapitalism due to the concepts of [[bourgeois]] economic [[individualism]],&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi. 2000. Pp. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; and instead he proposed a state supervised economy, although he contrasted it to Russian "State Supercapitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Salvemini, Gaetano.Under the Axe of Fascism. READ BOOKS, 2006. Pp. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Fascism presented the economic system of [[Corporatism#Fascist corporatism|corporatism]] as the solution that would preserve private initiatives and property while allowing the state and the syndicalist movement to intervene in the economy in the matters where private initiative intervenes in public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Salvemini. Pp. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;  This system would lead also to some nationalizations when necessary and the  greatest participation of the employees in all the aspects of the company, and in the utility given by the company.

'''John Christopher Bartholomew''' (or '''J.C. Bartholomew''') (15 January 1923 – 16 January 2008) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[cartography|cartographer]] and [[geography|geographer]].

==Life==

Bartholomew was the son of Marie Antoinette Sarolea, daughter of [[Charles Sarolea]] and [[John (Ian) Bartholomew]] (1890–1962). &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/john-bartholomew-1-1074884|title=John Bartholomew|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the great-great-grandson of the founder of [[John Bartholomew and Son Ltd.]]

He studied at [[Edinburgh Academy]] and [[Gordonstoun]] before taking a degree in geography at the [[University of Edinburgh]].

He took over directorship of [[John Bartholomew &amp; Co.]] from his father in 1951. At this stage Peter Bartholomew (1924-1987) was Chairman and Robert Bartholomew (b.1927) was production manager. The company's most memorable production during their control was the ''Times Atlas'' (five volumes but also available in a 'concise' version). It also published the first metric versions of the large scale [[Ordnance Survey]] maps of the UK, aimed at hikers and travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/bartholomew/family/|title=Bartholomew Family and Firm|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartholomew served as president of the [[British Cartographic Society]] in 1970–71. He was also a vice-president of the [[International Cartographic Association]], 1972–80, and from 1987 to 1993, he was president of the [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]]. He was  active on the committee of the Scottish Rights of Way Society (now ScotWays), and was made its honorary president.

On his death he left monies to pay for view indicators on the summits of both [[Berwick Law]] and the [[Braid Hills]].

He is buried against the north wall of the 20th century extension to [[Dean Cemetery]] in western [[Edinburgh]] at the memorial to his grandfather, [[John George Bartholomew]]. His father Ian, and uncle Hugh lie with him.

==Family==

He married Ginette Achard-James. They had five sons: John Eric, Philip, Christopher, Patrick and Ivon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Rose]], and great-uncle, [[David Rose (real estate developer)|David Rose]], founded the real estate development company Rose Associates in 1928 and built small apartment buildings in the Bronx and then in Manhattan in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rosenyc.com/about-us/our-history/| title=Our History| publisher=RoseNYC| access-date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Frederick P.

In 1980, Rose earned a [[Urban planning education|Masters in Regional Planning]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref name=CUNY /&gt; in a program lead by [[Ian McHarg]].

==Career==
After graduate school, Rose joined his family's real estate company, Rose Associates, in 1976 to learn  the practice of development. In 1979-80, he developed the American Thread Building, the first  live/work residential community to include computers and internet access in every home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McKeon |first=Nancy |date=August 31, 1981 |title=Wired for the Future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J-QCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |newspaper=New York Magazine |location=New York, NY |access-date=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When New York City's Mayor Koch called for assistance in developing affordable housing, Rose Associates obtained development rights for the area around the Atlantic Terminal. Rose was named project developer. In 1984, Rose over saw the design and approvals of the project, Atlantic Center, conceived of as one of the first large scale green mixed-use, mixed-income communities, with moderate-income housing units that were to be built under the New York City Partnership New Homes program. Prior to the start of construction, the project was later sold to [[Bruce Ratner]]'s firm, Forest City/Ratner.&lt;ref name=CUNY /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/40under40/1989/Rose| title=Jonathan Rose, 37| publisher=Crain's New York| date=1989| access-date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/nyregion/a-plan-for-brooklyn-rises-at-atlantic-terminal.html| title=A Plan for Brooklyn Rises at Atlantic Terminal| author=Jesus Rangel| date=September 28, 1986| publisher=The New York Times| access-date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Rose founded [[Gramavision Records]], now a subsidiary of [[Rykodisc]], producing over 75 jazz and new music recordings of artists including [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], the [[Kronos Quartet]], and [[John Scofield]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfana.org/about/new-home/project-development-team/jonathan-f-p-rose Theater for a New Audience: "Jonathan F.P.

In 1989, he left Rose Associates and founded Jonathan Rose Companies, a national development, owners' representative and investment firm. The firm is a leading developer of green, affordable and mix-income housing, well known for its Via Verde housing project in the South Bronx, a joint venture with Phipps Houses, and Highlands' Garden Village, a mixed use mixed income urban infill community in Denver Colorado. The firm's planning work is focused on increasing opportunity for lower income families and addressing environmental issues. As project managers, the firm works with cities and not-for-profits to realize projects such as Signature Theater on 42nd St. in New York City, The Orchestra of St Luke's DiMenna Center for Classical Music, The Irish Arts Center, and the redevelopment of the [[New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering]] campus in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name=NYT30Minute /&gt; Rose was given the Visionary Leadership Award by the MIT Center for Real Estate in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://sap.mit.edu/article/standard/real-estate-center-marks-milestone|title=Three Days of Anniversary Festivities|publisher=MIT School of Architecture &amp; Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jonathan Rose Companies’ Smart Growth Investment Fund was the country’s first real estate fund focused exclusively on acquiring and retrofitting green buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stephen|first1=Del Percio|title=Rose Smart Growth Investment Fund Makes First New York City Acquisition|url=http://www.greenrealestatelaw.com/2009/01/first-nyc-acquisition-for-rose-fund/|accessdate=20 November 2016|publisher=Green Real Estate Law Journal|date=January 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm now has six investment funds, four of which focus on the acquisition and preservation of affordable housing. In 2017, Rose's firm purchased Forest City's national federally subsidized affordable housing portfolio, as well as its affordable housing property management group and its [[Fair Housing Act|FHA]] Mortgage operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-developer-jonathan-rose-plows-into-affordable-housing-1488342601|title=New York Developer Jonathan Rose Plows Into Affordable Housing| publisher= Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose is the author of ''The Well-Tempered City: What Modern Science, Ancient Civilizations, and Human Nature Teach Us About the Future of Urban Life,'' published by Harper Wave in September 2016 to mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Well-Tempered City|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257563-the-well-tempered-city| publisher=GoodReads| accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rose proposes that in order to "harmonize" cities Rose proposes a methodology built on five qualities: coherence, circularity, resilience, community, and compassion. [[Siddhartha Mukherjee]] commented that "...this provocative, important, and majestically composed book about the future of cities should be essential reading for our times." The review in the [[Stanford Social Innovation Review]] found that the book "overlooks organic and spontaneous responses to urban issues" and offered limited practical advice. &lt;ref name=ssir&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ssir.org/book_reviews/entry/dissonance_harmony_and_compassion |title=Dissonance, Harmony, and Compassion |author=Richard Sinkoff  |date=2017 |website=SSIR |publisher= |access-date=23 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received a [[PROSE Award]] for 'Outstanding Scholarly Work by a Trade Publisher' in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://proseawards.com/winners/| title=2017 Award Winners| publisher= American Publisher Awards|access-date=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8050">'''Karina Constantino David''' is a former chairperson of the [[Civil Service Commission (Philippines)|Civil Service Commission of the Philippines]]. She also served as the chairperson of the Career Executive Service Board, a government entity supervising the top management personnel of the Philippine government. She presently sits as a member of the [[Government Service Insurance System]] (GSIS) Board of Trustees.

David is the wife of Professor Emeritus [[Randy David]] of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] and daughter of the renowned historian [[Renato Constantino]]. She is also the mother of journalist [[Kara David]] and UP Diliman geology professor Dr. Carlos Primo David.

==Early life and education==
Daughter to historian [[Renato Constantino]], David earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Sociology]] at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] in 1966. She completed academic requirements in the [[Master of Arts]] in Sociology program (orals lacking) from the same university in 1968. She obtained a [[Master of Arts]] in Economic and Social Studies from The [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in [[England]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="CSC"&gt;Record profile, Civil Service Commission, 2003......&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil service chief==
David was appointed by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] on February 23, 2001, as chairperson of the Civil Service Commission, succeeding Corazon Alma G. De Leon.&lt;ref name="CSC"/&gt;

On January 22, 2008, Karina Constantino-David stated that 40% of 3,000 government officials, including Cabinet officials, are unqualified to hold their positions: "these officials, consisting of managers, directors, assistant secretaries and undersecretaries, do not have the appropriate educational background and skills to perform their duties well; they don't have the correct educational skills and appropriate background plus experience to perform their respective duties well."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=106449  Abs-Cbn Interactive, CSC: 40% of govt officials unqualified for posts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080123-114181/CSC-chief-David-chides-Arroyo-on-appointments  newsinfo.inquirer.net, CSC chief David chides Arroyo on appointments]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

David drew flak from government workers for her comments on the qualifications of presidential appointees. In a statement, the Convergence of Vigilant, Empowered and Responsible Government Employees said David failed to professionalize the bureaucracy after serving almost as long as President Arroyo, and that her comments were "very unprofessional and uncalled for". Babae sa Kaunlaran, another organization of government workers, also criticized the statement as highly political. Public criticism centered on the fact that David's husband, broadcaster Randy David, is a known anti-Arroyo critic associated with leftist groups.

Press Secretary [[Ignacio Bunye]], meanwhile, said that David's "sweeping generalizations in a luncheon speech do a disservice to the over one million civil servants, both career and appointed, who work diligently each and every day to serve the people of the Philippines."

'''Karl Gottlieb von Windisch''' ({{lang-la|Carolus Theophil Windisch}}, {{lang-hu|Windisch (Vindis) Károly}}, January 28, 1725, [[Pressburg]] – March 30, 1793, Pressburg) was a [[Hungarian German]] writer who produced a series of letters that were published as ''"Briefe über den Schachspieler von Kempelen nebst drey Kupferstichen die diese berühmte Maschine vorstellen"'', translated as ''"Inanimate Reason; or a Circumstantial Account of That Astonishing Piece of Mechanism, M. de Kempelen's Chess-Player; Now Exhibiting at No. 9 Savile-Row, [[Burlington Gardens]]"'', following a series of performances of [[The Turk]] that he attended. The letters have been cited often since their publication in attempts to uncover the secret of the machine. Windisch spoke [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and was the first publisher of an academic Journal in Eastern Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4748">{{about|the form of bribery||Kickback (disambiguation)}}
A '''kickback''' is a form of negotiated [[bribery]] in which a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] is paid to the bribe-taker in exchange for services rendered. Generally speaking, the remuneration (money, goods, or services handed over) is negotiated ahead of time.  The kickback varies from other kinds of bribes in that there is implied [[collusion]] between agents of the two parties, rather than one party [[Extortion|extorting]] the bribe from the other.&lt;ref name="Wrage14"&gt;Wrage, Alexandra Addison. ''Bribery and Extortion: Undermining Business, Governments, and Security.'' Westport, Conn.: Praeger Security International, 2007. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the kickback is usually to encourage the other party to cooperate in the illegal scheme.&lt;ref name="Kran387"&gt;Kranacher, Riley, and Wells, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "kickback" comes from [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] [[English language]], and describes the way a recipient of illegal gain "kicks back" a portion of it to another person for that person's assistance in obtaining it.&lt;ref name="Campos"&gt;Campos, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and methods==
The most common form of kickback involves a vendor submitting a [[fraudulent]] or inflated invoice (often for goods or services which were not needed, of inferior quality, or both), with an employee of the victim company assisting in securing payment. For his or her assistance in securing payment, the individual receives some sort of payment (cash, goods, services) or favor (the hiring of a relative, employment, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Albrecht, Albrecht, and Zimbelman, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Kickback brokers" are individuals who may not receive the kickback personally, but who help link the individual or company providing the goods or services with individuals capable of assisting with the illegal payments.  For helping to link the two colluding parties, either or both parties may make a payment to this "broker".&lt;ref&gt;Campos, p. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In government==
Kickbacks are one of the most common forms of government corruption.&lt;ref name="Campos" /&gt; In some cases, the kickback takes the form of a "cut of the action," and can be so well known as to be common knowledge—and even become part of a nation's culture.  For example, in [[Indonesia]], [[President Suharto]] was publicly known as "Mr. Twenty-Five Percent" because he required that all major contracts throughout the nation provide him with 25 percent of the income before he would approve the contract. And, in [[Pakistan]], [[President Asif Ali Zardari]] was publicly known as "Mr. Ten Percent" for the same reason, which later became hundred percent. After coming into the government, he started taking 10% of all major contract investments before he would approve the contract.&lt;ref name="Wrage14" /&gt; However, kickbacks differ from other forms of corruption, such as diversion of assets, as in [[embezzlement]], because of the collusion between two parties.&lt;ref name="Kran387" /&gt;

Kickback schemes can be pervasive.  For example, in the [[United States]], companies providing medical services to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] patients were paying doctors to send patients to them, whether the patient needed the treatment, diagnosis, or test or not.  In 1987, the [[United States Congress]] passed the stringent [[Anti-Kickback Act]] to prevent such schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Buchbinder and Shanks, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the political scene was realigned dramatically by the ''[[Mani pulite|Tangentopoli]]'' scandals in the 1990s, which uncovered widespread use of kickbacks in the national and local governments.

[[Symantec]] is an American [[computer software]] company founded on March 1, 1982.&lt;ref name="mania"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=1987-10-12|title=Merger Mania Strikes Software Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[international corporation]] that specializes in selling [[security]] and [[information management]] software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-25|url= http://www.informationweek.com/update-symantec-to-acquire-veritas-for-$135-billion/d/d-id/1029104 |title=UPDATE: Symantec To Acquire Veritas For $13.5 Billion  |work=[[InformationWeek]]|date=2004-12-16|author=Hulme, George V.|author2=Foley, John  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is listed on the [[NASDAQ-100]] stock market index and [[Fortune 1000]] list of the largest American companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|date=2006-09-12|title=SilverBack Appoints VP of Global Sales and VP of Product Marketing; Peter Klanian &amp; Jonathan Wolf Named to Join Executive Team.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Hendrix]] founded the company in 1982 with the help of a [[National Science Foundation]] grant. Symantec was originally focused on [[artificial intelligence]]-related projects, and Hendrix hired several [[Stanford University]] [[natural language processing]] researchers as the company's first employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= International Directory of Company Histories|volume=10|publisher=St. James Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the company's [[initial public offering]] in 1989, Hendrix left the company in 1991 and moved to [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-11-01|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Hendrix_Gary/Hendrix_Gary.oral_history.2004.102657945.pdf|title= Oral History of Gary Hendrix  PDF Document |publisher=Computer History Museum|date=2004-11-19|author=Spicer, Dag|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has acquired 57 companies, purchased stakes in 2 firms, and divested 26 companies, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. Of the companies that Symantec has acquired, 50 were based in the United States. Symantec has not released the financial details for most of these mergers and acquisitions.

Symantec's first acquisition was C&amp;E Software on January 1, 1984, and the founder of C&amp;E Software, [[Gordon Eubanks]], became the new [[chief executive officer]] of Symantec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-10-30 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/04/07/BU45281.DTL |title=Symantec Chair Will Become CEO of Oblix |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=1999-04-07 |author=Evangelista, Benny |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030217185345/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F1999%2F04%2F07%2FBU45281.DTL |archivedate=February 17, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has made three acquisitions with a value greater than $1&amp;nbsp;billion: [[VeriSign]] was acquired on May 19, 2010 for $1.250 billion, [[Altiris]] was acquired on April 6, 2007 for $1.038&amp;nbsp;billion, and Symantec purchased [[Veritas Software]] on July 2, 2005 for $13&amp;nbsp;billion. The deal with Veritas was Symantec's largest acquisition and made Symantec the fifth-largest software company in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-10-30|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E5DD163AF936A15755C0A9639C8B63|title= Shareholders Approve Symantec-Veritas Software Merger  |work=The New York Times|date=2005-06-25|author=Flynn, Laurie J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company made the most acquisitions in 2004 with six: [[ON Technology]], [[Brightmail]], [[TurnTide]], [[@stake]], [[LIRIC Associates]], and [[Platform Logic]].

==Life==
Mario López studied Civil Engineering in Guatemala's public university and worked in construction, real state development projects, road construction, urban construction, offices, shopping centers, telecommunications business and renowable energy projects.

As he says himself in interviews with communication media, his professional life started working as a public employee in Municipalidad de Guatemala (Guatemala City Hall) and Central Government.

Afterwards, he became an entrepreneur in construction business achieving his first project through a long term mortgage. He was later dedicated to the construction of roads across Guatemala. Due to tough competitors, he decided to explore new horizons. This is how the construction business began, developing housing projects.

In 1972, the businessman Mario Lopez Estrada founded Constructora Maya, an independent construction company.

According to a financial report in Bloombergs website,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-08-17|title=Bloomberg Businessweek|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bloomberg_Businessweek&amp;oldid=93007746|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1986 to 1991 he worked as Ministro de Comunicaciones, Infraestructura y Vivienda (Minister for Communications, Infraestructure and Housing) during the first democratic government in Guatemala, with expresident Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo. Mario Lopez Estrada ventured the aggressive telecommunications business in 1993. Since that time he has made Tigo Guatemala the number 1 teleccommunications company in the country.

==Career==
In the 1980s, he served as the head of the state telecommunications company.&lt;ref name="bloombergaugust2014"&gt;Blake Schmidt, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-04/richest-guatemalan-lopez-emerges-with-tigo-cell-service Carlos Slim Bested by Mobile Billionaire in Guatemala], ''[[Bloomberg Business]]'', August 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; López was Minister of Communications in the government of [[Vinicio Cerezo]], who served as [[President of Guatemala]] from 1986-91.&lt;ref name=Guatevision&gt;{{cite news|title=Minister of Communications in the government of Vinicio Cerezo|url=http://www.guatevision.com/el-primer-centroamericano-en-la-lista-de-billonarios-es-guatemalteco/|accessdate=5 March 2015|work=Guatevision|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the president of [[Tigo Guatemala]], that country's largest [[mobile phone]] service provider with more than eight million users and market share of over 54%.&lt;ref name="Tigo"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com.mx/tigo-la-formula-para-permanecer-en-la-cima/ Tigo: the formula to stay on top]. 21 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013, Tigo promoted adoption of [[smartphone]]s by its users; it started by selling 30,000 smartphones per month, then in late 2013 100,000 per month, and in late 2014 sold 150,000 per month.&lt;ref name="Tigo" /&gt;

==Telecommunications==
In the nineties, he started the telecommunications business in Guatemala.  Back then, the business was very new. And as the global business was growing, so was Guatemala's, which allowed commercial advantage before its competitors started subsidiaries in the country.

Makate shared the concept with his employer [[Vodacom]] and they used it but he was not paid for it. He laid a charge against Vodacom and won the case against them after an 8-year battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.enca.com/south-africa/please-call-me-guy-relieved-after-years-of-court-battles|title=One on one with 'Please Call Me' inventor, Makate|work=eNCA|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also rejected former CEO [[Alan Knott-Craig (Senior)]]'s claim that he had come up with the idea of the messaging service. Yet the High Court found against Makate, holding that Geissler had not had the authority to promise Makate such compensation and that the debt would have expired (in legal terms, been prescribed) within three years.

Makate appealed the case, and later took it to the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7367">'''Porter's four corners model''' is a predictive tool designed by [[Michael Porter]] that helps in determining a [[competitor]]'s course of action. Unlike other predictive models which predominantly rely on a firm's current [[strategy]] and capabilities to determine future strategy, Porter's model additionally calls for an understanding of what [[motivate]]s the competitor. This added dimension of understanding a competitor's internal culture, value system, mindset, and assumptions helps in determining a much more accurate and realistic reading of a competitor's possible reactions in a given situation.

== Four corners model==
;Motivation – drivers:
This helps in determining competitor's action by understanding their goals (both [[strategic]] and [[Military tactics|tactical]]) and their current position vis-à-vis their goals. A wide gap between the two could mean the competitor is highly likely to react to any external threat that comes in its way, whereas a narrower gap is likely to produce a defensive strategy. 
The question to be answered here is: What is it that drives the competitor? These drivers can be at various levels and dimensions and can provide insights into future goals.
 
;Motivation – management assumptions:
The [[perception]]s and [[:wikt:assumption|assumptions]] the competitor has about itself and its industry would shape strategy. This corner includes determining the competitor's perception of its strengths and weaknesses, organization culture and their beliefs about competitor's goals. If the competitor thinks highly of its competition and has a fair sense of industry forces, it is likely to be ready with plans to counter any threats to its position. On the other hand, a competitor who has a misplaced understanding of industry forces is not very likely to respond to a potential attack.
The question to be answered here is: What are competitor's assumption about the industry, the competition and its own capabilities?
   
;Actions – strategy:
A competitor's strategy determines how it competes in the market. However, there could be a difference between the company's intended strategy (as stated in the annual report and interviews) and its realized strategy (as is evident in its acquisitions, new product development, etc.). 
It is therefore important here to determine the competitor's realized strategy and how they are actually performing. If current strategy is yielding satisfactory results, it is safe to assume that the competitor is likely to continue to operate in the same way.
The questions to be answered here are: What is the competitor actually doing and how successful is it in implementing its current strategy? 

;Actions – capabilities:
This looks at a competitor's inherent ability to initiate or respond to external forces. Though it might have the [[motivation]] and the drive to initiate a strategic action, its effectiveness is dependent on its capabilities. 
Its strengths will also determine how the competitor is likely to respond to an external threat. An organization with an extensive distribution network is likely to initiate an attack through its channel, whereas a company with strong financials is likely to [[counter attack]] through price drops.
The questions to be answered here are: What are the strengths and weaknesses of the competitor? Which areas is the competitor strong in?

== Strengths==
;Considers implicit aspects of competitive behavior:
Firms are more often than not aware of their rivals and do have a generally good understanding of their strategies and capabilities. However,  motivational factors are often overlooked. Sufficiently motivated competitors can often prove to be more competitive than bigger but less motivated rivals. What sets this model apart from others is its insistence on accounting for the "implicit" factors such as culture, history, executive, consultants, and board's backgrounds, goals, values and commitments and inclusion of management's deep beliefs and assumptions about what works or does not work in the market.&lt;ref name=academy&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100828230713/http://www.academyci.com/ftse/Competitive_Analysis_Training.html Competitive Analysis Training], [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] (SCIP)&lt;/ref&gt;  

;Predictive in nature:
Porter's four corners model provides a [[Conceptual framework|framework]] that ties competitor's capabilities to their assumptions of the competitive environment and their underlying motivations. Looking at both a firm's capabilities (what the firm can do) and underlying implicit factors (their motivations to follow a course of action) can help predict competitor's actions with a relatively higher level of confidence. The underlying assumption here is that decision makers in firms are essentially human and hence subject to the influences of affective and automatic processes described by [[neuroscientist]]s.&lt;ref name=academy /&gt; Hence by considering these factors along with a firm's capabilities, this model is a better predictor of competitive behavior.

== Use in competitive intelligence and strategy ==
Despite its strengths, Porter's four corners model is not widely used in strategy and competitive intelligence. In a 2005 survey by the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]]'s (SCIP) frequently used analytical tools, Porter's four corners does not even figure in the top ten.&lt;ref&gt;[ State of the art: competitive intelligence], Research report 2005-2006 [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] (SCIP)&lt;/ref&gt;

However this model can be used in competitive analysis and strategy as follows:

'''Strategy development and testing''': Can be used to determine likely actions by competitors in response to the firm's strategy. This can be used when developing a strategy (such as for a new product launch) or to test this strategy using [[simulation]] techniques such as a [[Business war games|business war game]].

''''Early warning''':  The predictive nature of this tool can also alert firms to possible threats due to competitive action.

Porter's four corners also works well with other analytical models. For instance it complements [[Porter five forces analysis]] well. Competitive cluster analysis of industry products in turn complements four corners analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.exinfm.com/training/pdfiles/course12-2.pdf |title= Course 12: Competitive Intelligence (Part 2 of 2) |author= Matt H. Evans, CPA, CMA, CFM |publisher= Excellence in Financial Management }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using such models that complement each other can help create a more complete analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3220">'''Power to the edge''' refers to the ability of an organization to dynamically synchronize its actions; achieve [[Command and control (military)|command and control]] (C2) agility; and increase the speed of command over a robust, networked grid. The term is most commonly used in relation to military organizations, but it can equally be used in a civilian context.

"Power to the edge" is an information and organization management philosophy first articulated by the U.S. Department of Defense in a publication by Dr. [[David S. Alberts]] and Richard E. Hayes in 2003 titled: "Power to the Edge: Command...Control...in the Information Age." This book was published by the [[Command and Control Research Program]] and can be downloaded from the [http://www.dodccrp.org/ Program's website].

==Principles==
Power to the edge advocates the following:

*Achieving situational awareness rather than creating a single operational picture
*Self-synchronizing operations instead of autonomous operations
*Information "pull" rather than broadcast information "push"
*Collaborative efforts rather than individual efforts
*Communities of Interest (COIs) rather than stovepipes
*"Task, post, process, use" rather than "task, process, exploit, disseminate"
*Handling information once rather than handling multiple data calls
*Sharing data rather than maintaining private data
*Persistent, continuous information assurance rather than perimeter, one-time security
*Bandwidth on demand rather than bandwidth limitations
*IP-based transport rather than circuit-based transport
*Net-Ready KPP rather than interoperability KPP
*Enterprise services rather than separate infrastructures
*COTS based, net-centric capabilities rather than customized, platform-centric IT

==Agility==
The philosophy of power to the edge is aimed at achieving organizational agility. Such agility has six attributes:

*Robustness: the ability to maintain effectiveness across a range of tasks, situations, and conditions
*Resilience: the ability to recover from or adjust to misfortune, damage, or a destabilizing perturbation in the environment
*Responsiveness: the ability to react to a change in the environment in a timely manner
*Flexibility: the ability to employ multiple ways to succeed and the capacity to move seamlessly between them
*Innovation: the ability to do new things and the ability to do old things in new ways
*Adaptation: the ability to change work processes and the ability to change the organization

      <comment>Removed external link to an archive of "Recent Proxy Statements" published by the SEC. This link takes the user to an archive of 2009 proxy statements and surfing the URL screenshots to more recent archives only go through 2012. These screenshot archives are therefore irrelevant and certainly not "recent." Perhaps a new web URL now houses recent proxy statements.</comment>

A '''proxy statement''' is a statement required of a firm when soliciting shareholder votes. This statement is filed in advance of the annual meeting. The firm needs to file a proxy statement, otherwise known as a Form DEF 14A (Definitive Proxy Statement), with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].  This statement is useful in assessing how management is paid and potential conflict-of-interest issues with auditors.  The statement includes:
* Voting procedure and information.
* Background information about the company's nominated directors including relevant history in the company or industry, positions on other corporate boards, and potential conflicts in interest.
* Board compensation.
* Executive compensation, including salary, bonus, non-equity compensation, stock awards, options, and [[deferred compensation]]. Also, information is included about perks such as personal use of company aircraft, travel, and tax gross-ups. Many companies will also include pre-determined payout packages for if an executive leaves the company.
* Who is on the audit committee, as well as a breakdown of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor.

SEC proxy rules: The term "proxy statement" means the statement required by Section 240.14a-3(a) whether or not contained in a single document.

In many cases, shareholder votes—particularly institutional shareholder votes—are determined by [[proxy firm]]s which advise the shareholders...

Traditionally, [[broker-dealer]]s have been permitted to vote for "routine" proposals on behalf of their shareholders if the shareholders do not return the proxy statement. This has been controversial, and in 2006 the NYSE Proxy Working Group recommended that the rules be modified so that uncontested director elections were not considered routine.&lt;ref&gt;NYSE Working Group. (June 5, 2006). [https://www.nyse.com/pdfs/REVISED_NYSE_Report_6_5_06.pdf REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PROXY WORKING GROUP TO THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE].&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC approved the rule on July 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyse/2009/34-60215.pdf Order Approving Proposed Rule Change, as modified by Amendment No. 4, to Amend NYSE Rule 452 and Corresponding Listed Company Manual Section 402.08 to Eliminate Broker Discretionary Voting for the Election of Directors, Except for Companies Registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and to Codify Two Previously Published Interpretations that Do Not Permit Broker Discretionary Voting for Material Amendments to Investment Advisory Contracts with an Investment Company]. Release No. 34-60215; File No. SR-NYSE-2006-92. Discussed by the NY Times Dealbook at: [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/sec-split-on-broker-voting-change/ Curbs on Broker Voting Are Approved].&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, the SEC announced that it was seeking public comment on the efficiency of the proxy system.&lt;ref&gt;SEC. [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-122.htm SEC Votes to Seek Public Comment on U.S. Proxy System].&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some controversy over "proxy access" which is a method to allow shareholders to nominate candidates which appear on the proxy statement. Currently, only the nominating board can place candidates on the proxy statement. The United States [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] specifically allowed the SEC to rule on this issue. In 2010, the SEC passed a rule which allowed certain shareholders to place candidates on the proxy statement;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-155.htm SEC Adopts New Measures to Facilitate Director Nominations by Shareholders].&lt;/ref&gt; however, the rule was struck down by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120403125211/http://corpgov.proxyexchange.org/2011/07/what-would-proxy-access-look-like-if-done-right/ What Would Proxy Access Look Like if Done Right?].

'''Qubo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|j|uː|b|oʊ}} {{respell|KEW|boh}}; stylized as '''qubo''') is an [[United States|American]] multi-platform children's entertainment programming service. Qubo consists of a 24-hour [[television network]], alternately known as Qubo Channel (which is available as a [[digital terrestrial television|digital multicast service]] on [[owned-and-operated station]]s and some [[network affiliate|affiliates]] of corporate sister [[Ion Television]], and on some [[multichannel video programming distributor|pay television providers]]), a [[video on demand]] service, and the branding of a weekly [[block programming|programming block]] on [[Ion Television]] under the name "Qubo Kids Corner".

==History==
===Formation===
In May 2006, [[Ion Media Networks]], [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]] (which owned a 32% interest in Ion Media at the time),&lt;ref name="reuters-ionnbcsale"&gt;{{cite news|title=ION Media Networks, Citadel, and NBC Universal Reach Agreement to recapitalize ION -- ION expected to become privately held following transaction |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/04/idUSIN20070504124800ION20070504|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=May 4, 2007|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corus Entertainment]], [[Scholastic Corporation]] and [[DreamWorks Classics|Classic Media]] (which is now owned by the aforementioned NBCUniversal through [[DreamWorks Animation]]) announced plans to launch a new, multi-platform children's entertainment brand known as Qubo, oriented towards providing "educational, values-oriented programming" targeted towards children between 4 and 18 years of age. The brand would encompass programming blocks on NBC Universal and Ion's respective flagship broadcast television networks ([[NBC]], [[Telemundo]] and [[Ion Television]]), a [[video on demand]] service, a website, and a standalone 24-hour network to be carried as a [[digital subchannel]] on television stations owned by Ion Media Networks and by cable and satellite providers.&lt;ref name=mcn-qubo&gt;{{cite web|title=Qubo’s Rodriguez: Offering a 'Building Block’ to Kids|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/qubo-s-rodriguez-offering-building-block-kids/367423|author=Luis Clemens|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=February 16, 2008|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qubo president Rick Rodriquez (who formerly served as a programming executive at [[Discovery Communications]]) explained in a 2008 interview with ''[[Multichannel News]]'' that Qubo was designed as a bilingual brand, offering programming in both [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. While Qubo would initially carry Spanish-language dubs of its programming for its Telemundo block, Rodriquez did not rule out the possibility of developing original children's programming tailored to [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] audiences through Qubo in the future. He felt that the market for Spanish-language children's programming had been underserved by existing outlets (such as Telemundo and [[Univision]]), and envisioned the possibility of programming which could "bridge the gap" and educate Spanish-speaking children on the English language, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=mcn-qubo/&gt;

The Qubo brand was intended to represent a "building block for kids," as reflected by its logo. The name "Qubo" was chosen because it had a "fun" sound, and was usable in both English and Spanish.&lt;ref name=mcn-qubo/&gt;

===Launch===
Qubo launched on September 9, 2006, with the premiere of weekend morning blocks on NBC (which aired exclusively on Saturday mornings, replacing ''[[Discovery Kids on NBC]]'', a weekly block programmed by the [[Discovery Kids]] cable network) and Telemundo (which aired on both Saturday and Sunday mornings). That was followed on September 15 by the introduction of a daytime block on i: Independent Television (now Ion Television), which initially aired on Friday afternoons. At launch, its programming included the first-run animated series ''[[Dragon (TV series)|Dragon]]'' (produced by Scholastic) and ''[[Jane and the Dragon (TV series)|Jane and the Dragon]]'' (produced by Corus subsidiary [[Nelvana]]), along with ''[[VeggieTales]]'' and its spinoffs ''[[3-2-1 Penguins!]]'' and ''[[Larryboy: The Cartoon Adventures]]'' (produced by Classic Media subsidiary [[Big Idea Entertainment|Big Idea]]) – marking the first time that ''VeggieTales'' had ever been broadcast as a television program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qubo, for English- and Spanish-speaking youngsters|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/qubo-for-english-and-spanish-speaking-youngsters/|author=Ed Robertson|periodical=MediaLife Magazine|date=August 24, 2006|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC Debuts Kids Programming Brand Qubo|url=http://adage.com/article/media/nbc-debuts-kids-programming-brand-qubo/111473/|author=Andrew Hampp|periodical=[[Advertising Age]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|date=August 24, 2006|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qnbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=QUBO TO LAUNCH ON NBC, TELEMUNDO AND THE I NETWORK THIS SEPTEMBER|url=http://www.ionmedia.tv/press/press.cfm?id=14|website=Ion Media Networks|date=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''VeggieTales'' and its spin-offs incorporated lessons related to [[Christianity|Christian]] teachings; initially, this religious content was edited out of the original ''VeggieTales'' broadcasts on Qubo at the request of NBC's [[standards and practices]] department. The move, however, drew criticism from the [[conservatism|conservative]] [[watchdog group]] [[Parents Television Council]], which filed a complaint against NBC. A representative for NBC replied in a statement that the editing conformed to guidelines within the network's broadcast standards "not to advocate any one religious point of view". ''VeggieTales'' creator [[Phil Vischer]] also expressed discontent with the edits, stating that he was not informed that religious content would be removed from the series, and that he would have refused to sign a contract with Qubo if he had known of the decision beforehand. Vischer said, "I would have declined partly because I knew a lot of fans would feel like it was a [[sellout]] or it was done for money." Still, Vischer added that he understood NBC's wish to remain religiously neutral, and said, "''VeggieTales'' is religious, NBC is not. I want to focus people more on 'Isn't it cool that Bob and Larry are on television?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Talking Veggies Stir Controversy at NBC |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215266,00.html |author=Sandy Cohen |agency=[[Associated Press]] |website=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |publisher=Fox News Network, LLC |date=September 22, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629071019/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215266,00.html |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, a Spanish-language version of the Qubo website was launched.&lt;ref name=mp&gt;{{cite news|title=Hola!: Qubo Launches 24/7 Kids Channel|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/53538/hola-qubo-launches-247-kids-channel.html|author=David Goetzl|periodical=MediaPost|publisher=MediaPost Communications|date=January 9, 2007|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A companion digital subchannel network, Qubo Channel, launched on Ion Media Networks' stations on January 8, 2007, initially featuring a schedule of children's programming in rolling four-hour blocks; Ion intended to seek carriage of the channel on cable, satellite and telco providers.&lt;ref name=mp/&gt; In May of that year, NBC Universal sold its minority stake in Ion Media Networks to [[Citadel LLC]].&lt;ref name="reuters-ionnbcsale"/&gt; On December 3, 2007, Qubo Channel expanded its programming offerings to include shows from other producers, as well as some programs that were already airing on Ion Television's Qubo block. In addition, the rolling schedule was expanded to a six-hour block, which repeated four times per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=qubo Launches as 24-Hour Digital Broadcast Channel on ION Media Networks Station Group|url=http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20070108005950&amp;newsLang=en|agency=[[BusinessWire]]|publisher=Ion Media Networks|date=January 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, Ion Media Networks and [[Comcast]] reached an agreement to continue carrying Ion's digital channels, including Qubo and [[Ion Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ION Media Networks and Comcast Announce Affiliation Agreement for Channel Suite|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/080114/20080114005909.html|website=[[Yahoo!

Qubo also began to air a series of [[public service announcement]]s featuring characters from its programs in collaboration with the [[Ad Council]], the [[United States Olympic Committee]] and the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], advocating exercise and healthy living.&lt;ref name=mcn-qubohealth&gt;{{cite web|title=Qubo Sets Health Guidelines For Advertisers|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/orphan-articles/qubo-sets-health-guidelines-advertisers/130484|author=Larry Barrett|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Ion Media Networks filed an inquiry with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to seek [[must-carry]] cable and satellite carriage to expand Qubo's distribution to other providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ion Uses FCC Inquiry on Content Control to Push for Qubo Carriage|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/fcc/ion-uses-fcc-inquiry-content-control-push-qubo-carriage/296408|author=John Eggerton|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in May 2010, Ion signed carriage agreements with [[Advanced Cable Communications]] and [[Blue Ridge Communications]], as well as deal with Comcast's [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] system to add Qubo on the providers' digital tiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ION Media Networks Inks Multi-Affiliate Deals for Diginets|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-226922906.html|periodical=Telecommunications Weekly|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=May 26, 2010|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012–present===


With the acquisition of NBCUniversal by [[Comcast]], it was announced on March 28, 2012, that NBC and Telemundo would discontinue their Qubo blocks and replace them with [[NBC Kids|NBC Kids and MiTelemundo]]. Both blocks would be programmed by [[Universal Kids|PBS Kids Sprout]], a preschool-oriented television network that came under NBC ownership as part of the merger – on July 7;&lt;ref name="Weisman"&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC to launch Saturday kids block|url=https://variety.com/2012/tv/news/nbc-to-launch-saturday-kids-block-1118052022/|author=Jon Weisman|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubino"&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC, With Assist From Sprout, to Launch Saturday Morning Preschool Block|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/nbc-assist-sprout-launch-saturday-morning-preschool-block/360743|author=Lindsay Rubino|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=NewBay Media|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andreev"&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC Launches Preschool Saturday Block Programmed By Sprout|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/03/nbc-launches-preschool-saturday-block-programmed-by-sprout|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Ion Television as the only remaining network with a Qubo-branded programming block (with Ion Media acquiring NBCUniversal's interest in the venture). At the time, PBS Kids Sprout was a competing joint venture between Comcast, [[HIT Entertainment]], [[PBS]] and [[Sesame Workshop]]; NBCUniversal acquired full ownership of the cable network in November 2013, and PBS Kids Sprout suddenly became simply '''Sprout''' as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBCUniversal Acquires Ownership of Kids' Channel Sprout|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nbcuniversal-acquires-full-ownership-kids-655690|author=Kimberly Nordyke|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=November 13, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBCUniversal Buys Remainder of Sprout Network|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nbcuniversal-buys-remainder-of-sprout-network-1384382409 |author=Keach Hagey|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[News Corp.]]|date=November 13, 2013|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ion Media Networks acquired the stakes in Qubo held by Classic Media (which became DreamWorks Classics in 2012, after its acquisition by [[DreamWorks Animation]]), Scholastic and Corus Entertainment in 2013, with all three companies retaining program distribution partnerships with the network. The Qubo block on Ion Television was renamed as the "Qubo Kids Corner" on January 4, 2015, concurrent with the block's move from Friday to Sunday mornings.&lt;ref&gt;http://kidscreen.com/2014/12/09/ion-television-launches-sunday-morning-qubo-kids-block/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{main|List of programs broadcast by Qubo}}
Qubo Channel features archived content from the programming libraries of Corus Entertainment, DreamWorks Classics and Scholastic Corporation, with its programs targeted at children ages 2 to 15. Though there was an early promise of the three companies - NBC, Universal and Ion Media - to produce a new series for the network and program block each year, Qubo only produced one original series, ''[[Turbo Dogs]]'', which aired from 2007 to 2008. Qubo Channel regularly broadcasts series aimed at preschoolers during the morning and afternoon hours, while series aimed at older children are featured as part of the network's evening and midnight schedule.

Programming on Qubo Channel and its companion Ion Television block account for all educational programming content on Ion Television's owned-and-operated stations and certain Ion affiliates that carry the 24-hour channel, relieving the network from the responsibility of carrying programs compliant with guidelines dictated by the [[Children's Television Act]] on its other subchannel services (especially those that simulcast the [[Home Shopping Network]] and [[QVC]], two networks that by virtue of their primary distribution via cable and satellite television, are exempt from the guidelines).

On September 28, 2010, Qubo Channel launched "Qubo Night Owl", (running from 12:00 to 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]) featuring classic animated series, many of which came from the [[Filmation]] library owned by [[DreamWorks Animation]] (currently owned by [[NBCUniversal]]).&lt;ref name=ion-nightowl&gt;{{cite press release|title=QUBO CHANNEL KICKS OFF FALL 2010 LINEUP STARTING MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27|url=http://www.ionmedianetworks.com/press/qubo-channel-kicks-off-fall-2010-lineup-starting-m?id=237|website=Ion Media Networks|date=|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The block was restructured in August 2013 to feature a mix of animated and live-action series sourced solely from Qubo's distribution partners.

==Affiliates==
{{main|List of Qubo affiliates|List of stations owned and operated by Ion Media Networks}}
&lt;!--- Please update station count in below paragraph whenever the accompanying list referenced is updated. ---&gt;
{{As of|November 2015}}, Qubo has current and pending affiliation agreements with 67 television stations encompassing 34 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name=re&gt;{{cite web|title=Stations for Network - Ion|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&amp;network=Qubo|website=[[RabbitEars]]|accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network has an estimated national reach of 58.83% of all households in the United States (or 183,832,858 Americans with at least one television set). Like parent network Ion Television, the network's stations almost exclusively consist of network-owned stations (with the exception of [[Louisville, Kentucky]] affiliate [[WBNA]]). Qubo's programming is available by default via a national feed that is distributed directly to cable and satellite providers in markets without a local Ion Television station that carries the network.

Qubo does not have any over-the-air stations in several major [[media market|markets]], most notably [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]; [[Toledo, Ohio]]; [[San Diego|San Diego, California]]; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]; and [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]. A key factor in the network's limited national broadcast coverage is the fact that Ion Media Networks does not actively seek over-the-air distribution for the network on the [[digital subchannel]]s of other network-affiliated stations (in contrast, its parent network Ion Television – which had similarly limited national coverage following the [[digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition]] – has begun subchannel-only affiliation arrangements through agreements with [[NBC Owned Television Stations]]' [[Telemundo|Telemundo Station Group]] subsidiary and [[Media General]] during 2014 and 2015&lt;ref name="aas-ionkxan"&gt;{{cite news|title=New broadcast TV network hits Austin’s airwaves|url=http://www.mystatesman.com/news/entertainment/dinges-new-broadcast-tv-network-hits-austins-airwa/npMDg/|author=Gary Dinges|newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|publisher=[[Cox Enterprises]]|date=November 14, 2015|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with very few stations that [[network affiliate|contractually carry]] the network's programming (with limited exceptions in markets such as Louisville, Kentucky and [[Anchorage, Alaska]]). As a result, Ion Media Networks owns the vast majority of the stations within Qubo's affiliate body.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3468">The '''Timurite movement''' or '''Timur movement''' (Тимуровское движение) was an [[altruistic]] youth [[volunteering]] movement in the [[Soviet Union]] promoted via mass [[youth organization]]s of [[Little Octobrist]]s and [[Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization|Young Pioneers]]. The participants of the movement were called '''Timurites''' (тимуровцы, '''timurovtsy''').&lt;ref&gt;"Timur Movement Among Soviet Youth", in: ''The Modern Encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet History'', vol. 54, ''[[Academic International Press]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the movement was borrowed from the popular novel for youth ''[[Timur and His Squad]]'' by [[Arkady Gaidar]]. The youngster Timur and his squad clandestinely did good deeds: helped the families of the [[Red Army]] soldiers and combated the local gang of young  [[hooligan]]s headed by Mishka Kvakin. At first Timur's squad was taken for hooligans as well, but eventually they earned gratitude. It was written in 1940, and quickly gained popularity, as other Gaidar's books. The same year a movie was released based on the novel. When the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] started in 1941, teams of Timurites all over the country, in addition to helping the families of soldiers, did large amounts of unskilled work: cleaning railways from snow, preparing firewood, loading/unloading cargo, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Miller, "Eccentric Propositions: Essays on Literature and the Curriculum", 1984, {{ISBN|0-7100-9987-8}}, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Their activities were widely reported in newspapers and by radio.

The book was an obligatory part of school curriculum in the Soviet Union.

Later the Timurite movement was centralized and organized, with Central Staff and Congresses.&lt;ref name=bse/&gt;

Timurite teams were also created in other [[socialist state]]s: [[East Germany|GDR]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], [[People's Republic of Poland]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref name=bse&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article110608.html "Timurite movement"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Timurite movement was revived in a number of [[post-Soviet States]]: in [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molodoi-gazeta.ru/article-2326.html Тимуровцы сегодня и всегда! | Molodoi-gazeta.ru&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Belarus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brsm.by/ru/news/details?id=657 Волонтерская социальная акция «Тимуровцы» - Интернет - портал "Молодежь Беларуси" - Подробности / Новости / Русская версия&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503172422/http://www.brsm.by/ru/news/details?id=657 |date=2008-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kazakhstan]] by [[Jas Otan]], the youth wing of the ruling [[Nur Otan]] party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kazpravda.kz/index.php?uin=1152243624&amp;chapter=1210073650&amp;act=archive_date&amp;day=6&amp;month=5&amp;year=2008 "Staking on youth"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525181419/http://www.kazpravda.kz/index.php?uin=1152243624&amp;chapter=1210073650&amp;act=archive_date&amp;day=6&amp;month=5&amp;year=2008 |date=2011-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Two Point Hospital''''' is a 2018 business [[simulation game]] developed by [[Two Point Studios]] and published by [[Sega]] for [[Linux]], [[MacOS]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. A [[spiritual successor]] to [[Bullfrog Productions]]' 1997 game ''[[Theme Hospital]]'', ''Two Point Hospital'' puts players in the role of a hospital administrator tasked with constructing and operating a hospital (and, by extension, an empire of hospitals in the fictional Two Point County, where the game is set) with the goal of curing patients of fictitious, comical ailments. The game was designed and developed by some of the creators of ''Theme Hospital'', including [[Mark Webley]] and [[Gary Carr (video game developer)|Gary Carr]]. They made use of their expertise in developing games such as ''Theme Hospital'' and ''[[Black &amp; White (video game)|Black &amp; White]]'' and wanted players to be confident in using the menus. The use of humour was deemed important because visiting real hospitals is unpopular.

''Two Point Hospital'' was released to a positive reception from critics, who acclaimed it for its style, humour and its faithfulness to ''Theme Hospital'''s aesthetics, but the game was criticised for its repetitiveness and lack of challenge.

After they left Bullfrog, Webley and Carr continued to discuss a follow-up to ''Theme Hospital''.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt; Their first attempt was ''ER Tycoon'', which was planned during Carr's time at Mucky Foot Productions but was cancelled because they could not find a publisher for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_146/4839-Footprints |title=Footprints: The rise and fall of Mucky Foot |accessdate=10 February 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322084411/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_146/4839-Footprints |archivedate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mucky Foot closed in 2003 and Carr joined Lionhead; however, ongoing projects did not permit the continuation of the ''Theme'' concept. In 2015, Carr left Lionhead, which was closed by [[Microsoft Game Studios]] the following year. Webley had left the studio in 2013. They designed to found [[Two Point Studios]] to follow up on the ''Theme'' idea. Webley stated, "Gary and I have been talking about this project for a number of years and are really excited to be announcing Two Point Studios".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/01/16/theme-hospital-creators-announce-two-point-hospital-7234494/ |title=Theme Hospital creators announce Two Point Hospital |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date=16 January 2018 |accessdate=17 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116191605/http://metro.co.uk/2018/01/16/theme-hospital-creators-announce-two-point-hospital-7234494/ |archivedate=16 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VentureBeat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgeIntPrev" /&gt; 

The timing of a ''Theme Hospital''-style game was also apt: Art director Mark Smart said making a hospital-simulation game "felt right" and that there was "a lot of love for Theme Hospital", while studio co-founder and technical director Ben Hymers said players had been wanting a sequel to ''Theme Hospital'' for years.&lt;ref name="GamesTMDev" /&gt; According to Webley and Carr, ''Two Point Hospital'' is a completely new game, rather than a reapplication of new assets to an existing game.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt; Carr said "I wanted to work on something like Theme Hospital again, appealing to a broader range of people".&lt;ref name="EdgeIntPrev" /&gt; The game was developed by envisioning fictional symptoms, often based on word play, and the means for the player to cure them, and determining which ones most attracted the attention of the development team.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt; Webley and Carr also wanted to develop a graphics style that would remain "future-proof" relative to changes in graphics rendering technology, and opted to use [[claymation]]-like effects, which they found made it easy for players to observe on-screen situations and would not become dated.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt;

Online features were an early target of the design of ''Two Point Hospital''; Webley and Carr recognised that players of management games tend to prefer single-player experiences. They designed the online elements of the game to be opt-in and to feature asynchronous gameplay elements, including multiplayer challenges. Players would be tasked with achieving objectives such as curing patients within a set number of months and their scores would be placed on online leaderboards. Players would be able to view their  progress compared to that of friends and other players during the challenge from these leaderboards, an approach Webley and Carr took from [[ghost (video gaming)|ghosts]] that are used in some arcade racing games.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt; ''Theme Hospital'' was recognised as one of the first games with support for [[mod (video gaming)|mods]]; Webley and Carr said ''Two Point Hospital'' would feature mod support, which will not be available at launch.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt;

To produce the game, Webley and Carr considered a few approaches to developing the game before signing with Sega. They originally considered [[crowdfunding]] the development through [[Kickstarter]]; they spoke to Playtonic Games, which had used Kickstarter to revive a 1990s property ''[[Banjo-Kazooie (series)|Banjo-Kazooie]]'' for ''[[Yooka-Laylee]]''. Shortly afterwards, however, they found video game development via Kickstarter was waning and decided this approach was too risky.&lt;ref name="gibiz interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgeIntPrev" /&gt; They also considered taking an [[early access]] approach.&lt;ref name="gibiz interview" /&gt; Hymers suggested they approach Sega as a publisher, which was fortuitous because Sega wanted to expand their profile with games similar to ''Theme Hospital''.&lt;ref name="gibiz interview" /&gt; While they were in negotiations with Sega, they selected a number of [[Lionhead Studios]] developers to help with ''Two Point Hospital''{{'}}s development, but Microsoft closed Lionhead in April 2016 before the Sega deal was complete and they had to quickly choose their staff on limited funds, building the team more quickly than they had planned.&lt;ref name="gibiz interview" /&gt;

According to Hymers, the developers used their experience in making games including ''Theme Hospital'', ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'', and ''[[Black &amp; White (video game)|Black &amp; White]]'' to make ''Two Point Hospital'', which ''GamesTM'' described as "engrossing time-vacuum gameplay".&lt;ref name="GamesTMDev" /&gt; Smart said the team wanted the game to be accessible and not throw players in at the deep end, and that they wanted players to have confidence when examining the sub-menus and realising the level of strategy involved. Smart also said people do not like to visit hospitals and that using humour makes a difference. According to Smart, the ailments were concocted backwards; someone would decide that they wanted something and the team worked from that, or that they worked on them from "terrible puns".&lt;ref name="GamesTMDev" /&gt;

Hymers said queues of patients and their movement along corridors was difficult to produce because the game is in 3D, which raised questions about wall thickness and cell width. He compared these elements with their counterparts in ''Theme Hospital'' and believed it was much easier in that game, which is 2D with graphics made from [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], and that people were drawn in front of the walls. He also stated that making people avoid each other was tricky.&lt;ref name="GamesTMDev" /&gt; The game was developed using the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=“We want to build out a world of sim games” &lt;br&gt; How Two Point Hospital is a step toward bringing Bullfrog-era sim games back from the dead |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/16/theme-park-sequel-details/ |website=Rock Paper Shotgun |accessdate=18 July 2018 |date=16 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712122348/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/16/theme-park-sequel-details/ |archive-date=12 July 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later patch for the game featured character customisation, and a "[[copy and paste]]" rooms feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/535930/announcements/detail/2694733067859957921?utm|title=Coming This Week: Customisation Update!|publisher=[[Two Point Studios]]|website=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]|accessdate=3 October 2018|date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Two Point Hospital'' received critical acclaim. Media review aggregation website [[Metacritic]] summarised the game as garnering "Generally favorable reviews".{{efn|name=mc}}&lt;ref name="metacritic" /&gt;

The game received praise for its nostalgia compared with that of ''Theme Hospital'' and its improvements over it. Rachel Weber of ''[[Games Radar]]'' was positive about the game's use of nostalgia, stating that the game had "taken the funny bones" from the original and transplanted them into ''Two Point Hospital''.&lt;ref name="GRadar" /&gt; Weber also praised other aspects of the game, calling it a "delight".&lt;ref name="GRadar" /&gt; Johnny Chiodini of ''[[EuroGamer]]'' stated that the game "stays true to the spirit of its sort-of predecessor" in ''Theme Hospital'', and that it was a "modernised successor".&lt;ref name="eurogamer review" /&gt; Chiodini also called the game a "welcome reinvention of a childhood classic".&lt;ref name="eurogamer review" /&gt; The game's similarity to ''Theme Hospital'' was also praised by ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'', who said it "extends beyond its predecessor both in terms of detail and scope" and that ''Theme Hospital'' had been replaced by "something better".&lt;ref name=Edge /&gt; ''[[GamesTM]]'' described ''Two Point Hospital'' as "Theme Hospital 2.0" and "A modern take on a beloved title", but also believed that it could have distanced itself from it more.&lt;ref name=GamesTMRev /&gt; Similar compliments about the game's similarities to ''Theme Hospital'' were given by [[Jeuxvideo.com]] and James Ide of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.&lt;ref name=JVRev /&gt;&lt;ref name=MirrorRev /&gt; Even before release, Dominic Tarason of ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' described ''Two Point Hospital'' as "Theme Hospital 2 in all but name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dominic Tarason |title=A longer peek behind the curtain at Two Point Hospital |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/02/26/a-longer-peek-behind-the-curtain-at-two-point-hospital/ |website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |accessdate=22 October 2018 |date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was shared by ''[[Bit-Tech]]''{{'}}s Rick Lane, who described ''Two Point Hospital'' as ''Theme Hospital''{{'}}s "sequel in all but name".&lt;ref name=BTRev /&gt; Jacob Bukacek of ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' was of the opinion that ''Two Point Hospital'' used ''Theme Hospital'' as a base for improvement and remarked that it "isn’t Theme Hospital remade; It’s Theme Hospital improved".&lt;ref name=HCGRev /&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Ben Reeves thought that [[Two Point Studios]] had done "a remarkable job reviving Theme Hospital".&lt;ref name=gameinformer /&gt; ''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'' described ''Two Point Hospital'' as "the perfect cure" for "Bullfrog deficiency" and said it is precisely what ''Theme Hospital'' fans wanted it to be.&lt;ref name=GMRev /&gt;

Critics also praised the game's humorous content. UK newspaper ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' regarded the "amusing script and visual humour" of ''Two Point Hospital'' as one of its best features, calling it "endearing".&lt;ref name=MetroRev&gt;{{Cite web |title=Game review: Two Point Hospital creates a healthy obsession |author= |work=Metro |access-date=3 September 2018 |url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/31/two-point-hospital-review-healthy-obsession-7899066/ |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904224617/https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/31/two-point-hospital-review-healthy-obsession-7899066/ |archive-date=4 September 2018 |dead-url=no  |date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nic Rueben of ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' also commented on the game's humour, writing; "it’s not that any individual element is hilarious – it’s more of an infinite dads pulling infinite crackers sort of scenario. It just feels comfy, goofy and pleasant&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="RPS" /&gt; ''GamesTM'' believed the humour was taken from Bullfrog and praised its balance, saying the game is not "trying too hard" and keeps it light-hearted.&lt;ref name=GamesTMRev /&gt; Jason Coles of the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' also liked the game's "Good sense of humour" and abundance of puns.&lt;ref name=DailyStarRev /&gt; James Swinbanks of ''[[GameSpot]]'' echoed these sentiments by describing the game's "British" sense of humour as the game's "overwhelming charm",&lt;ref name=GSRev /&gt; as did Paul Tamburro of ''[[Game Revolution]]'' with his description of the game as "delightfully lighthearted",&lt;ref name=Gamerev /&gt; and ''[[GamesRadar+]]''{{'}}s Rachel Weber's concurrence with Swinbanks about the humour's Britishness.&lt;ref name=GRadar /&gt; ''[[Shacknews]]'''s Chris Jarrard compared the game's "outstanding" radio station to ''[[SimCity 2000]]''{{'}}s (which he described as "nonsensical") news system.&lt;ref name=SNRev /&gt;

Jose Cabrera of ''[[IGN|IGN Spain]]'' was positive about gameplay but critiqued its lack of challenge (an opinion shared by Tamburro&lt;ref name=Gamerev /&gt;).&lt;ref name="IGN Spain" /&gt; Cabrera referred to the game as being "fun and casual", but was well put together. Cabrera also called the game a "perfectly balanced simulation" that is based on the nostalgia of ''Theme Hospital''.&lt;ref name="IGN Spain" /&gt; TJ Hafer believed ''Two Point Hospital'' "revitalizes the business management genre".&lt;ref name=IGNRev /&gt; Fraser Brown of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' magazine was positive about the game's release, calling it a "brilliant management game regardless of nostalgia".&lt;ref name="PCGamer" /&gt; Brown, however, was critical of the game's balance, saying some "missions bleed together" and only a few levels are noticeably distinct.&lt;ref name="PCGamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGamerUK"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[PC Gamer UK]]|author=Fraser Brown|title=Infectious|date=November 2018|pages=76-79|publisher=[[Future plc]]|ISSN=1470-1693|issue=323|location=Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms include the game basics being too similar to those of ''Theme Hospital'',&lt;ref name=MetroRev /&gt; repetition,&lt;ref name=MetroRev /&gt; the lack of an ability to copy rooms,&lt;ref name=Edge /&gt; and the lack of a sandbox mode.&lt;ref name=Gamerev /&gt;

'''Union democracy''' is a term referring to the governance of [[trade unions]], in terms of the quality of election procedures at ensuring the executives of a union most accurately represent the interests of the members.

==Theory==
In 1911, a German sociologist, [[Robert Michels]] propounded a view that all democratic organisations were prone to become oligarchies because of the growth and size of modern organisations, the need for specialisation of officials, and the necessity that this [[division of labour]] would lead the rank and file to struggle to understand the activities of their leaders. Michels argued that this amounted to an [[iron law of oligarchy]]: all groups, regardless of how [[democracy|democratic]] they may be at the start, eventually and inevitably develop into [[oligarchy|oligarchies]] with swollen [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]]. Michels himself, after falling out with the German Social Democrat Party, migrated to Italy and joined Mussolini's Fascist Party. Nevertheless, his ideas were popularized after the [[Second World War]] in particular by [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], Trow, and [[James Samuel Coleman]] in a book entitled, ''[[Union Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical Union]]'' (1957). This book argued that the [[International Typographical Union|ITU]] was an exception to Michels' general law, and that the conditions necessary to ensure democracy were that an opposition to the union's leadership could form. This depended on ensuring the leadership did not monopolize the channels of communication with members. Lipset and his coauthors confined their understanding of "democracy" to the existence of organised opposition. They were skeptical that the conditions in the ITU, which made it democratic, were likely to arise in many other unions spontaneously. Following this, in 1959, the US Federal government passed the [[Landrum-Griffin Act 1959]] to mandate democratic principles be followed in union governance.

==Law==
*[[International Labour Organization]], [[Freedom of Association Convention]] (1948) No 87
*US [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act 1959]]
*UK [[Trade Union Act 1984]], now in the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]] s 72

==Principles==
Principles include:
*Frequent, contested elections, with rank-and-file members regularly challenging incumbents, and resultant turnover in officers and representatives, with all candidates having equal access to membership lists before elections, including the right to copy the list.
*Open publications, with newsletters and websites publishing all members' views, including those critical of officials, representatives, or union policy, and the union encouraging open and free debate and discussion of issues and candidates; with election candidates having equal use of union publications and means of communication (website, newsletter, e-mail list) to put out their campaign material.
*Member ratification, with all [[contracts]] and "side agreements" between union and management subject to ratification by secret ballot by the members covered by the contract.
*[[Strike action|Strike]] votes: members should vote on striking, on return to work, and on other decisions during strikes, with strike votes not used to force members to ratify contracts ("either you vote 'yes' or you vote to strike").
*"Informed vote": the complete text of proposed contract changes, amendments, referendums, etc. should be distributed to members prior to ratification votes, with sufficient time for meaningful membership review and discussion, and the union circulating (or at least not obstructing) different opinions about the contract offer.
*Election of representatives: [[shop steward]]s, business agents and other member representatives (paid or otherwise) should be elected by secret ballot of the members they represent, and subject to [[recall election|recall]] by the members they represent; stewards and active members should be trained in [[labour rights|legal rights]] and [[organizing (management)|organizing]]; and there should be  stewards' councils that meet to plan and coordinate action.
*[[grievance|Grievants']] rights: workers should participate fully in the grievance process at every step, with full information about their case and its progress.
*Member access to information: union representatives should provide members current and complete copies of the contract and the union constitution/bylaws, and the contract and constitution should be published on union websites. Members must have easy access to information on officers' salaries, budget, and expenses. Union representatives should regularly inform members of their rights under national and local law, and how to enforce them, including rights and responsibilities under the relevant regulations.
*Regular [[Local union|local]] meetings, to be at least quarterly, announced ahead of time, at a time and place convenient to members, with an agenda circulated in advance, under reasonable [[quorum]] requirements not set so high as to prevent valid membership meetings. Real business should be conducted (not just a pep rally), with members encouraged to speak, make proposals, vote, and ask questions, and meeting minutes available to all members afterwards.
*Independent organizing and communication outside union official structure: members should have the right to organize in independent committees and caucuses, publish rank-and-file newsletters and websites, and run candidates for union office, and union officers should encourage this.
*Inclusion and equality: all members should be treated fairly, with the union fighting discrimination by management and among members. Union officers and representatives should reflect membership in terms of gender, race, language, [[craft]] or [[bargaining unit]], [[seniority]], etc. Union contracts, constitution and bylaws, meetings, and publications should be accessible in the languages spoken by members.
*Education for members: unions should train all interested members in legal rights and organizing, including how to participate effectively in the union and how to organize on the job.

While there are some superficial similarities to the so-called [[organizing model]] of union activity, advocates of union democracy are swift to point out that many of the alleged exemplars of the organizing model do not, in their internal structure, meet the requirements listed above.

'''VATBox''' is a global cloud-based provider of automated VAT recovery and governance solutions, founded in 2012 by Isaac Saft and Noam Guzman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vatbox#/entity|title=VATBox {{!}} crunchbase|website=www.crunchbase.com|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background - VAT Recovery==
In 2014 the [[2013 enlargement of the European Union|EU28]] member states collected €975,901.6&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat|title=Home - Eurostat|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; million of [[Value-added tax|value-added tax (VAT)]], of which billions of corporate VAT are left un-recovered. [[European Union value added tax|VAT recovery in the EU is a complex]], unstructured process that presents multiple challenges for governance and corporate tax officers. Claims are addressed using semi-automated/manual and error-prone processes that are both time-consuming and costly. Failed and incorrect claims result in loss of revenue, lack of financial governance and improper compliance.

== Product - Automated VAT Recovery &amp; Governance==
VATBox automatically detects and recovers VAT – both foreign and domestic - wherever the tax is charged. VATBox's technology - which is part of growing trend in [[Financial technology|FinTech]] and [[Regulatory technology|RegTech]] automation - captures the data and evidence from multiple sources, matches and validates the data, pinpoints any leaks or missing evidence, determines whether it qualifies for VAT recovery, and if it does, then submits the claim. The solution also performs analytics, providing real-time visibility to all ongoing claims both at aggregate and detailed levels. The company also holds numerous patents relating to use of technology in the reclaim process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stks.freshpatents.com/Vatbox-Ltd-nm1.php|title=Vatbox Ltd patents list  (updated weekly)|website=stks.freshpatents.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
