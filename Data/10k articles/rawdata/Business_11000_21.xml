'''47th Street''' is an east–west running street between [[First Avenue (Manhattan)|First Avenue]] and the [[West Side Highway]] in the [[boroughs of New York City|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. Traffic runs one way along the street, from east to west, starting at the [[headquarters of the United Nations]]. The street features the [[#Diamond District|Diamond District]] in a single block (where the street is also known as '''Diamond Jewelry Way''') and also courses through [[Times Square]].

==Notable locations==
*[[The Factory]] was [[Andy Warhol]]'s original New York City studio from 1963 to 1968, although his later studios were known as The Factory as well. The Factory was located on the fifth floor at 231 East 47th Street, between [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]] and [[Third Avenue]].
*The top duplex of the Dyckman's Jewelry Exchange at 73 West 47th Street was [[Russian Americans in New York City|Russian emigrant]] artist [[Alexander Ney]]'s studio and home for four decades (1974–2015) following his [[immigration]] from the [[Soviet Union]].
*After opening in 1920 on West 45th Street, the [[Gotham Book Mart]] later moved to 51 West 47th Street and then spent many years at 41 West 47th Street before moving to 16 East 46th Street.
*[[Vanderbilt Avenue (Manhattan)|Vanderbilt Avenue]] is a short street that runs from [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] to 47th Street, between [[Park Avenue]] and [[Madison Avenue]]. The street was built as the result of construction of [[Grand Central Terminal]], and is named for the family of the terminal's original owners, [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]. Grand Central Terminal can be accessed via 47th Street through the "Northwest Passage", a {{convert|1000|ft|m|sing=on}}-long corridor that runs parallel to the tracks, connecting to the Main Concourse by way of an entrance at the northeast corner of East 47th Street and Madison Avenue.
*The portion of 47th Street between [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[Sixth Avenue]] is known as the [[#Diamond District|Diamond District]], which hosts a kosher cafe, the [[IDT Megabite Cafe]].
*An [[NHL]] store stands at 1185 Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) between West 46th Street and West 47th Street. It is the only one of its kind in the country and has its own [[Starbucks]] within the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26423|title=NHL Powered by Reebok Store – New York, NY|work=nhl.com|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[TKTS]] booth, reconstructed and reopened in 2008, is located on 47th Street at [[Duffy Square]], between [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. Theater-goers may purchase [[Broadway theatre]] tickets at a discount of 25 to 50% for listed plays and musicals on the day of the shows. The [[Morgan Stanley Building]] is located diagonally opposite to TKTS at Broadway and 47th Street.
*Broadway theatre is well represented on West 47th Street between Broadway and [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]], including the [[Brooks Atkinson Theatre]] (at 256 West 47th Street), the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] at (243 West 47th Street) and the [[Samuel J. Friedman Theatre]], formerly the Biltmore Theater (at 261 West 47th Street).

===Diamond District===
[[File:NYC diamond district.jpg|left|275px|thumb|View of the Diamond District at 47th Street and Fifth Avenue]]

The Diamond District is between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. The district was created when dealers moved north from an earlier district near [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]] and the [[Bowery]] that was created in the 1920s, and from a second district located in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]], near the intersection of [[Fulton Street (Manhattan)|Fulton]] and [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]]s, which started in 1931, and also at [[Maiden Lane (Manhattan)|Maiden Lane]], which had existed since the 18th century.  A notable, long-time anomaly of the district was the famous [[Gotham Book Mart]], a bookstore, which was located at 41 West 47th Street from 1946 to 2004.

The move uptown started in 1941. The district grew in importance when [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, forcing thousands of [[Orthodox Jews]] in the diamond business to flee Amsterdam and Antwerp and settle in New York City. Most of them remained after World War II, and remain a dominant influence in the Diamond District.&lt;ref name="Citycyclopedia"&gt;[[Kenneth T. Jackson|Jackson, Kenneth T.]] ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'', [[New-York Historical Society]]; [[Yale University Press]]; 1995. pp. 332–333.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor in the northward move was the co-location of finance and insurance companies who moved into the downtown districts, causing rents to drastically increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caratzas|first=Michael|year=December 13, 2016|title=LP-0962|url=http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/0962.pdf|journal=Landmarks Preservation Commission|volume=|pages=4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1941, the Diamond Dealers Club—an exclusive club that acts as a [[de facto]] diamond exchange and has its own [[synagogue]]—officially made the move up to midtown as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyddc.com/about-the-ddc1.html|title=About the DDC|website=Diamond Dealers Club New York|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is one of the primary centers of the global diamond industry,{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} as well as the premier center for jewelry shopping in the city. It is one of the largest diamond and jewelry districts in the United States, along with [[Jewelers' Row, Philadelphia]] and [[Jewelry District (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles's Jewelry District]], and it is the second oldest surviving jewelry district in the United States after Jewelers' Row in Philadelphia. Total receipts for the value of a single day's trade on the block average $400 million.&lt;ref&gt;[[WNBC-TV]]'s [[Jane Hanson]] on her ''Jane's New York'' special on the Diamond District.&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 90% of diamonds in the United States enter through New York. There are 2,600 independent businesses located in the district, nearly all of them dealing in diamonds or jewelry. Most are located in booths at one of the 25 "exchanges" in the district, and in a public corridor to 46th Street. Commission based hawkers are also a common sight and they usually solicit business for stores located on the street level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The NYC Diamond District – How to Avoid the Shopper's Trap |url=http://beyond4cs.com/2015/02/nyc-diamond-district-shoppers-trap/ |publisher=Beyond 4Cs |accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many deals are finalized by a simple, traditional blessing (''{{transl|yi|[[mazel tov|mazel]] und brucha}}'', which means "luck and blessing") and handshake.&lt;ref name="Citycyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/03/10/sparkle-street-usa/a91e2b8a-c8ad-450f-8c2b-2d89539f4aed/ "Sparkle Street, U.S.A."] by [[Margot Hornblower]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', March 10, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Retailers with shops line the streets outside. At 50 West 47th Street is the [[Gemological Institute of America]] which trains gem dealers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gia.edu/locations Locations], [[Gemological Institute of America]]&lt;/ref&gt; One distinguishing figure of the district is the diamond-motif street lights illuminating the corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5qUDg2ck7AC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=nyc.gov+diamond+district+landmark&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PZm4xOBIXC&amp;sig=ECF24Ab9hWAe2pBW9mWgsfO6r0U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBz-|title=Fodor's See It New York City|last=Staff|first=Fodor's Travel Publications, Inc|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Fodor's Travel Publications|isbn=9780876371367|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NYC Diamond District also holds three prominent trade interconnected buildings: the 580 Fifth Avenue Exchange, the DDC, Diamond Dealers Club, and [[Extell Development Company|the International Gem Tower]].

'''''Aerobiz Supersonic''''', known as {{nihongo|'''''Air Management II: Kōkū Ō wo Mezase'''''|エアーマネジメントII 航空王をめざせ}} in Japan, is a business simulation [[video game]] released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] by [[Koei]] in North America in August 1994. It was later ported to the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]]. It is a sequel to Koei's previous [[airline]] simulation game, ''[[Aerobiz]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Aerobiz Supersonic-20101226-172426.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of a game of Aerobiz Supersonic, taking place in 1957.]]
In the game, which is essentially the same as its predecessor, the player is the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of a start-up international airline. The player competes with three other such companies (either [[Game artificial intelligence|AI]]-controlled or other players) for dominance in the worldwide travel industry. Such dominance is obtained by purchasing slots in various airports around the world, and flying routes to and from those slots. Once a route is created, the player has control of what type of planes fly the route, the price of airfare, and numerous other variables.

The game includes numerous historical events that can help or hinder airline performance. Four different eras of play available for the player to choose. They include 1955–1975 (which depicts the dawn of jet airplanes), 1970–1990 (which depicts a period of instability, oil crises, and the end of the [[Cold War]]), 1985–2005 (which depicts the present day of economic prosperity and relative stable peace), and 2000–2020 (which depicts the replacement of jet planes with supersonic airplanes, the European Union extending to Russia, and countries trying to get airlines to fund alternative fuel research). This futuristic era was chosen by SG and Koei to be illustrated by San Francisco illustrator Marc Ericksen for the packaging art, showing two executives conferring over a holographic aircraft design in a futuristic airline terminal.

Airlines must be able to achieve the goals assigned to them within 20 years; only one airline can achieve this victory with no draws permitted. If none of the airlines can achieve the goal, then all airlines lose because [[stalemate]]s are not permitted at the end of the game. [[Tiebreaker]]s are also not permitted because games are not usually designed to be in ties at the end of the 20-year contest. In the rare instance that all airlines go bankrupt simultaneously, then all airlines would also lose.

==Events==

===Historical events===
The simulation includes numerous historical events, including:

*[[Summer Olympic Games]] accurate up to [[Sydney 2000]]. (Note, the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] were in Montreal, although the game has them in Toronto as Montreal is not in the game. However, some events of these games were held in Toronto, and in other cities throughout Eastern Canada.)
*The downfall of [[colonialism]]
*The secession of [[Singapore]] from [[Malaysia]]
*The Rise of [[Fidel Castro]] (1959)
*[[Suez Crisis]]
*[[Vietnam War]]
*[[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]
*[[Yom Kippur War]]
*[[1973 oil crisis|An international oil crisis]] (1973)
*[[Iran–Iraq War]]
*[[Operation Desert Storm]]
*[[Perestroika]]
*Destruction of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the reunification of [[Germany]]
*[[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|Fall of the Soviet Union]]
*Return of [[Hong Kong]] to the [[People's Republic of China]]
*Growth of the [[European Union]]

===Hypothetical events===
The simulation also includes hypothetical events, including:

* After 2000, the Summer Olympics start occurring in random selection of the game's major cities.
*[[Ukraine]] joining the [[European Union]] at JUL 1998.
*[[Belarus]] joining the [[European Union]] at JAN 1999.
*[[Switzerland]] joining the [[European Union]] at JUL 2003.
*[[Russia]] joining the [[European Union]] at OCT 2005.
*[[Civil war]] by random cities and random times (Although in the game, they often occur in Lima, Peru, which had a civil war in real time)
*The introduction and quick [[obsolescence]] of [[supersonic transport|commercial supersonic aircraft]] (2007–2016)
*Global [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil crisis]] in the mid-late 2010s
*The nations of the world asking the airlines for money to find alternatives to [[fossil fuel]]s
*Volcanic eruption in New Zealand
*Floods in Thailand&lt;ref&gt;[http://flood.firetree.net/?ll=13.7314,97.9651&amp;z=10 Hypothetical flooding of Thailand] at flood.firetree.net&lt;/ref&gt; and Vancouver, Canada&lt;ref&gt;[http://flood.firetree.net/?ll=49.2571,-123.1403&amp;z=8 Hypothetical flooding of Vancouver, Canada] at flood.firetree.net&lt;/ref&gt; (both events corresponding with global climate change)
*Earthquake in [[Sao Paulo]]

==Major players in the game==

===Eastern Bloc===
From the beginning of the game until 1986, the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries are stuck with tense relations with [[Western Europe]], [[North America]], and countries in the [[British Commonwealth]]. However, they have normal-excellent relations with [[Africa]]n countries, [[Middle East]]ern countries, countries in [[Central America]], [[South America]], and some [[Asia]]n countries. Airplanes from Eastern Bloc countries are small inefficient [[gas-guzzler]]s that can only do medium-range flights as their longest routes. After 1986, airlines from these countries can purchase more efficient [[Boeing]] planes from the United States of America. These airplanes become even cheaper when one of the Eastern European countries joins the European Union.

Russia enters in EU in 2005, so it will be much cheaper to buy Airbus planes. The latest models from [[Ilyushin]] and [[Tupolev]] are very cheap and a little bit more efficient than the previous models, so it can give the player an advantage when it comes to maximizing his profits.

===Western Bloc===

====Western Europe====
With normal-tense relations with Eastern European countries until around 1985, airlines that are headquartered in Western European countries must either purchase cheap airplanes from the "local" market or order slightly more expensive planes from the United States of America. After Perestroika, they can purchase from any plane manufacturing company. Joining the European Union in the mid-1990s makes airplanes cheaper or more expensive depending on relations with the United States prior to the founding of the EU.

====North America====
North America's situation in the game is identical to the situation found by Western European countries. The only difference is that planes from American companies are cheaper than planes from Western European countries. Since North America has a higher tourism rating than Europe until the 1990s, North America–based airlines can afford more airplanes and routes for a better risk-profit potential than European-based airlines.

===People's Republic of China and other countries===
Normalized relations with both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. allows all planes to be purchased by airlines headquartered in the People's Republic of China regardless of the year. However, improving relations with either country will reduce the price of the airplanes - giving the player a choice of acquiring either inefficient Soviet-made planes or efficient American-made planes at bargain prices. Like the People's Republic of China, countries that are not strongly affiliated with either [[NATO]] or [[Warsaw Pact]] may purchase from any manufacturer as long as relations are not tense (red).

An '''apparatchik''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑ:|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɑ:|t|tʃ|ɪ|k}}; {{lang-ru|[[wikt:аппаратчик|аппара́тчик]]}} {{IPA-ru|ɐpɐˈratɕɪk|}}), in [[Russian language|Russian]] colloquial terms also borrowed widely into other languages, was a full-time, professional [[functionary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] or the [[government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] ''apparat'' ([[Wiktionary:аппарат#Russian|аппарат]], apparatus), someone who held any position of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] or [[politics|political]] responsibility, with the exception of the higher ranks of management called [[nomenklatura]]. [[James H. Billington|James Billington]] describes an apparatchik as "a man not of grand plans, but of a hundred carefully executed details."&lt;ref&gt;James H. Billington, ''Fire in the minds of men'', Transaction Publishers, 1999, 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=a4PRx21WVqMC&amp;pg=PA455&amp;dq=apparatchik&amp;ei=Unp5Sve5G6PCM4j-vYUN&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=apparatchik&amp;f=false p. 455], {{ISBN|0-7658-0471-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0471-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often considered derogatory, with negative [[connotation]]s in terms of the quality, competence, and attitude of a person thus described.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Pearson, ''The rise and fall of the Soviet Empire'', Palgrave Macmillan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9EehH16HO48C&amp;pg=PR20&amp;dq=derogatory++Apparatchik&amp;ei=LgSoSsWKOZzKzATSy9CpCg#v=onepage&amp;q=derogatory%20%20Apparatchik&amp;f=false p. xx], 1998, {{ISBN|0-312-17407-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the apparat ('''apparatchiks''' or '''apparatchiki''') were frequently transferred between different areas of responsibility, usually with little or no actual training for their new areas of responsibility. Thus, the term apparatchik, or "agent of the apparatus" was usually the best possible description of the person's profession and occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Huntford, ''The new totalitarians'', Chapter 7 "The Rule of the Apparatchiks," Stein and Day, 1972, p. 135, {{ISBN|0-8128-1408-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8128-1408-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all apparatchiks held lifelong positions. Many only entered such positions in middle age.&lt;ref&gt;David Stuart Lane, Cameron Ross, ''The transition from communism to capitalism: ruling elites from Gorbachev to Yeltsin'', Palgrave Macmillan, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=08wU08p7QHAC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=apparatchik&amp;ei=Unp5Sve5G6PCM4j-vYUN&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=apparatchik&amp;f=false p. 25-26], {{ISBN|0-312-21612-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-312-21612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today ''apparatchik'' is also used in contexts other than that of the [[Soviet Union]] or communist countries. According to [[Collins English Dictionary]] the word can mean "an official or bureaucrat in any organization".&lt;ref&gt;apparatchik. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved 2 August 2012 from CollinsDictionary.com website:
http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/apparatchik&lt;/ref&gt; According to Douglas Harper's ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'', the term was also used in the meaning "Communist agent or spy", originating in the writings of [[Arthur Koestler]], c. 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Apparatchik Apparatchik] Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Bukichi Miki'''|三木 武吉|Miki Bukichi|15 August 1884 – 4 July 1956}} was a Japanese politician. He was a close friend and ally of [[Ichiro Hatoyama]], and was the key figure in carrying out the "conservative merger" that resulted in the formation of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]].

Despite being a powerful [[conservative]] politician in the [[Taishō period|Taishō]] and [[Shōwa period|Shōwa]] eras, Miki remarkably never held any cabinet post. He still has a high reputation as the archetype of a behind-the-scenes power broker, and at the zenith of their power there were times when both [[Kanemaru Shin]] and [[Hiromu Nonaka]] were openly complimented by Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] for having "surpassed Bukichi Miki".

Miki's nicknames included "the heckling general", "the wily schemer", and "the great [[tanuki]] of Japanese politics".

== Life before politics ==
He was born in [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]], then in [[Ehime Prefecture]] but now in [[Kagawa Prefecture]], as the first son of Komon Miki, an antiques dealer. His family was not related to that of [[Takeo Miki]].

In his second year at Takamatsu Secondary, now Kagawa Prefectural Takamatsu High School, he walked out on his bill at an [[udon]] restaurant and encouraged others to do the same, and thus was expelled from school. He transferred to Doshisha Secondary in Kyoto, now Doshisha Junior and Senior High School, but was expelled again for getting into a fight. He went to Tokyo with the help of the politician Tooru Hoshi but on 21 June 1901, the day on which Miki would go to work as a live-in student at his law office, Hoshi was assassinated.

Miki was admitted into Tokyo Vocational School, called [[Waseda University]] from 1902 and on, where he counted among his classmates future politicians [[Ryūtarō Nagai|Ryutaro Nagai]] and [[Ikuo Oyama]] and baseball player Shin Hashido. While spending much of his time chasing women in [[Shinjuku]], he earnestly studied law and practiced baseball. Although he even joined the Waseda Baseball Club at its inception, it was said that he exhibited little talent.&lt;ref&gt;Shogaku Yudate, スポーツ人国記 (Tokyo: Popura Shobo, 1934), 117-118.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his name does not appear in Bushi, the official records of the club, and he was also not a member of the Tomon Club, composed of the Waseda Baseball Club's alumni. This was also the time of his budding romance with Kaneko Amano, a woman known as "the beauty of Waseda" who was popular among the students and would go on to become Miki's wife. He graduated in 1904.

Miki worked for a brief time as a scribe at Waseda University Library.&lt;ref&gt;Hideyuki Fujiwara, "[http://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/Libraries/fumi/78/fumi78.pdf 知られざる図書館員 三木武吉]," Waseda Daigaku Toshokan Ho, March 15, 2010, 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year in 1905 he went to work with the [[Bank of Japan]] attached to their [[Moji-ku, Kitakyūshū|Moji]] branch. However he participated in an open-house anti-government meeting in opposition to the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] and after giving a speech demanding the resignation of Prime Minister [[Taro Katsura]] he was charged with violating the code of conduct for civil servants and was discharged. In 1907 he passed the Higher Civil Service Examination for the judiciary and was appointed as an assistant judicial officer in the [[Tokyo District Court]], but life as a civil servant did not suit his personality and after seven months he instead became a lawyer. The same year he married Kaneko Amano.

== In pre-war politics ==
In 1913 Miki was elected to the [[Ushigome]] ward assembly. Soon after he ran for a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] but was defeated. In 1916 he joined the [[Kenseikai]] and in 1917 won a seat in that year's general elections to the House.

Miki distinguished himself in his new role as a member of the House. Above all he more than earned his nickname, "the heckling general", through his trenchant criticisms of the government. He also caught the eye of [[Osachi Hamaguchi]] following his spirited debate with [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Minister]] [[Takejirō Tokonami|Takejiro Tokonami]] in defense of [[universal suffrage]]. After that Hamaguchi became his political mentor.

In 1920 Miki toured Siberia for one month as a member of a committee of inquiry of the [[National Diet|Imperial Diet]] concerning the [[Japan during the Siberian Intervention|Siberian expedition]]. The tour led Miki to the conclusion that the expedition was interference in the internal affairs of another nation inspired by the militaristic ambitions of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|army]] who were steeped in the traditions of the [[Meiji oligarchy]]. Therefore, he wrote up an open letter and a speech for [[Interpellation (politics)|question period]] which held the militarists, oligarchs, and bureaucrats accountable for the war and sought to link the neutralization of these forces to the establishment of true parliamentary democracy. With a view of also using it to force the resignation of incumbent Prime Minister [[Takashi Hara]], Miki handed in the completed manuscript to [[Takaaki Kato]], president of the Kenseikai, through Hamaguchi. However Miki was disheartened when the manuscript was rejected by Kato and Hamaguchi who advised him to focus on internal matters for fear his revelations about the origins of the war would damage Japan's international reputation. Even so, they were both deeply impressed by the depth and detail of his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isamu Togawa]], 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 71-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1922 Miki was also elected to the Tokyo City Council. He formed the Shisei Kakushin Domei which emphasized cleaning up city politics and clashed with the [[Rikken Seiyukai]]-aligned Shinkokai. At that time one of his political foes in Tokyo City politics was Shinkokai member Ichiro Hatoyama, who would later become a close friend.

In January 1924, at the young age of 39 after having served only two terms in the House, Miki was promoted to the post of Kenseikai Secretary General and led the party in the [[Japanese general election, 1924|general election of May 1924]]. The Kenseikai won a plurality of the seats, and Takaaki Kato set up his first cabinet with the support of the so-called "three groups protecting the constitution", the Kenseikai, the Rikken Seiyukai, and the Kakushin Club.

When Hamaguchi Osachi, who Miki had looked up to for a long time, took office as [[Minister of Finance (Japan)|Finance Minister]], Miki was appointed the Ministry's parliamentary councillor under Hamaguchi's tutelage. In 1927 he joined the [[Rikken Minseito]] under Hamaguchi's leadership, and at the same time went on a tour of Europe. Thus, Miki had reached the pinnacle of his pre-war political career when a disaster befell him. In 1928 he was implicated in a case of bribery by Keisei Railway of the Tokyo municipal government, was convicted in court, and, for the time being, ended up leaving politics.

== Political comeback up to the purge ==
In 1939 he became president of the newspaper firm Hochi Shimbun. He returned to politics in 1942, winning election as an independent candidate in that year's [[Japanese general election, 1942|general election]]. In the election, Ichiro Hatoyama also won office as an unaligned candidate. Before the war Miki and Hatoyama had been leading members of rivals parties, the Rikken Minseito and the Rikken Seiyukai. However, in wartime they were both defenders of liberalism who together resisted the military authorities, even if in the end they were both compelled to affiliate with the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association]]. At that time, Hatoyama and Miki made a pact to form a government one day with Hatoyama as prime minister and Miki as Speaker of the House of Representatives. In August 1942 Hochi Shimbun was bought out by [[Yomiuri Shimbun]].

After the war, he took part in planning the establishment of the [[Liberal Party (Japan, 1945)|Liberal Party]]. In the [[Japanese general election, 1946|elections of April 1946]] the Liberal Party won a plurality and it seemed like a real possibility that Hatoyama would become prime minister, but the formation of the cabinet fell through at the last minute when Hatoyama was [[Purge (During Occupation of Japan)|purged]] by the US occupation authorities. [[Shigeru Yoshida]] become President of the Liberal Party in Hatoyama's stead.

Because Yoshida still disliked the pre-war politicians for having been deferent to the military, he selected his cabinet in private consultation with his close advisor Joji Hayashi without discussing the matter with senior members of the Liberal Party including Miki, who was Chairman of the Executive Council, and Secretary General Ichiro Kono. The party leadership was furious, some even demanding Yoshida's removal from the party presidency, but Miki managed to calm them down by pointing out that if they withdrew their support from Yoshida then power would likely pass to the [[Japan Socialist Party|Socialist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 209-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, on 24 May 1946, two days after the formation of Yoshida's first cabinet, Miki was also purged.

== The fall of Yoshida and ascension of Hatoyama ==
On 24 June 1951, when the ban on holding office was lifted for those purged, Miki began seeking to have Prime Minister Yoshida removed in cooperation with Ichiro Kono and Hatoyama. The three were reinstated in the Liberal Party, but by now the party was completely controlled by the "Yoshida school" directly allied with the Prime Minister, and a promise Yoshida had made to hand back power to Hatoyama after his return had been effectively annulled.

Miki, Hatoyama, and Kono thus moved towards founding a new political party. However, Hatoyama suffered a stroke and the plan fell through. Miki changed course in favor of undermining Yoshida from within the Liberal Party. Operating behind the scenes, Miki devoted himself to all manner of schemes and became leader of the anti-Yoshida movement. To combat this, Yoshida took the advice of his political adviser Tsuruhei Matsuno and jolted the pro-Hatoyama faction by calling [[Japanese general election, 1952|a snap election]] in August 1952. On the recommendation of Kozen Hirokawa, Yoshida also expelled both Ichiro Kono and [[Tanzan Ishibashi]] from the Liberal Party on the basis of their opposition to his leadership. The fact that Miki Bukichi, the central dissident, was not expelled was said to be due to the debt of gratitude Yoshida felt to him for saving his first cabinet in 1946.

The Liberal Party won a majority government in the elections and Yoshida formed his fourth cabinet. The remainder of the pro-Hatoyama faction constituted the "Democratization League", essentially an opposition party operating within the ruling party. The Democratization League absented itself from the [[National Diet|Diet]] when a motion of censure was tabled by the opposition parties against [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry|Minister of International Trade and Industry]] [[Hayato Ikeda]] for his gaffe, "The bankruptcy and suicide of one or two small businessmen can't be avoided." The motion passed and Ikeda resigned.

In December 1952 the Democratization League ratcheted up the pressure on Yoshida against the backdrop of the passage of the revised draft budget. Next year, at the same time as the League arranged for Kono and Ishibashi to re-join the party, it forced the resignation of Secretary General Joji Hayashi and Chairman of the Executive Council Shuji Masutani, who were key allies of Prime Minister Yoshida. Miki was appointed Masutani's successor in the party's Executive Council. Seeking to throw the Liberal Party establishment into disarray, Miki drove a wedge between Yoshida and his ally Kozen Hirokawa by putting the idea into his head that Yoshida intended to make [[Taketora Ogata]] his successor. Then Miki slyly proposed to the Yoshida camp that Hirokawa be elevated to the position of Secretary General, presenting Yoshida with a no-win scenario in which he could either accede to the request and allow Miki to manipulate the party through Hirokawa, or refuse the request and further alienate him.&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説吉田学校 (Tokyo: Ryudo Shuppan, 1971), 255-257.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Hirokawa was not made Secretary General and his behind-the-scenes split with Yoshida became definitive.

On 28 February 1953 Yoshida responded to a question from the rightist socialist representative Eiichi Nishimura by calling him a "stupid fool" in the Diet. Miki discussed the matter behind closed doors with the leader of the [[Rightist Socialist Party of Japan|Rightist Socialist Party]], [[Inejiro Asanuma]]. Asanuma was considering a motion of no-confidence against the government but Miki changed his mind and Asanuma agreed instead to table a disciplinary action against the Prime Minister himself. Miki also brought [[Takeo Miki]] together with Tadao Oasa and Kenzo Matsumura, who were veteran politicians from before the war, and reached an understanding with them, and even arranged for Hirokawa's 30-man faction to abstain from the vote. Thus, the disciplinary action was approved.

Miki then talked reluctant opposition parties into tabling a motion of no-confidence against the government and entered talks with Yoshida while using the motion as a bargaining chip to urge the beleaguered Prime Minister to resign. Yoshida nevertheless turned Miki down and the Democratization League's 22 members separated from the Liberal Party. With their backing, on 14 March 1953, the House of Representatives passed the motion of no-confidence 229 votes in favor versus 218 against. Hirokawa and 16 of his followers then also split with the Liberal Party to form the Separatist Liberal Party.

Yoshida immediately dissolved the House and in [[Japanese general election, 1953|the elections]] his Liberals won 199 seats, a loss of 23, but held onto their status as first party. The separatists attained only 35 seats. In November, half a year from the election, Yoshida and Hatoyama met one another and most of the separatists who were loyal to Hatoyama re-joined the Liberal Party. Only eight men refused to return, Bukichi Miki, Ichiro Kono, Takechiyo Matsuda, To Matsunaga, Umekichi Nakamura, Shinjiro Yamamura, Masanosuke Ikeda, and Kaku Ando, who together called themselves the Japan Liberal Party. Others called them "The Eight Samurai," in reference to the new movie [[The Seven Samurai]].

In January 1954 con-man Masutomi Ito was exposed for perpetrating mass investment fraud, a scheme which eventually led investigators to a ring of shipbuilders who were bribing politicians in exchange for subsidies. Liberal Party Secretary General [[Eisaku Sato]] and Political Affairs Research Committee head Hayato Ikeda were suspected of involvement. A few days earlier Yoshida's Liberals had met with the Reform Party and the Separatist Liberal Party and held negotiations with representatives of each party in the hopes of unifying the three [[Right-wing politics|right]]-leaning parties. When the talks fell through, Miki saw his chance and linked up with Hatoyama and [[Nobusuke Kishi]] of the Liberal Party as well as Reform Party members Takeo Miki and Tadao Oasa to seek the establishment of a new anti-Yoshida political party. In November 1954 the [[Japan Democratic Party (1954)|Democratic Party]] was constituted with Hatoyama as president, Kishi as Secretary General, and Miki as Chairman of the Executive Council.

Next month Yoshida's cabinet finally resigned en masse and Hatoyama became prime minister. Half of Miki's long-held ambition for a government with Hatoyama as prime minister and himself as Speaker of the House of Representatives had been achieved. However, when the House elected its speaker immediately following the [[Japanese general election, 1955|general elections]], all the parties except Miki's Democratic Party banded together and put forward Liberal Party member Shuji Masutani as their joint candidate. Because of this, Miki, the candidate of the governing party who was expected to get elected as a matter of course, ended up being defeated and his dream came to nothing.

== The "conservative merger" ==
[[File:Bukichi Miki.jpg|thumb|right|Bukichi Miki from his days as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]]]]On 13 April 1955 Miki called upon the right-wing political parties to rally together and announced that should rivalries with the Hatoyama cabinet become an obstacle to the merger, the government was prepared to resign en masse.&lt;ref&gt;Mayumi Itoh, The Hatoyama Dynasty: Japanese Political Leadership Through the Generations (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), 127.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point Miki had been fretting over the unification of the [[Leftist Socialist Party of Japan|Leftist Socialist Party]] with its rivals the Rightist Socialists and what's more had been told by his doctor that he had contracted cancer and would live no more than three years.

At the same time as Miki was striving to reach consensus in the Democratic Party he engaged in manoeuvres within the Liberal Party. On 15 May 1955 he met with Banboku Ono, the Chairman of the Executive Council in the Liberal Party. Ono had once been a close aide to Hatoyama but was superseded by Miki even though Miki had previously been Hatoyama's political enemy, and for that Ono despised Miki more than anyone else. Even so, Miki pleaded with Ono, cleverly appealing to his strong sense of patriotism, and won his support. Then a meeting was held between Miki and Kishi and their Liberal Party counterparts Banboku Ono and Kojiro Ishii and they officially began the process of merging their parties. On the other hand, Reform Party leaders Takeo Miki and Kenzo Matsumura fired back with their argument that conservatives should be represented by two parties rather than only one. As the debate was coming to nothing, Hatoyama blurted out while weeping that his cabinet would have to resign, and panicking at the prospect, they ended up backing the merger.

However, the final controversy over who should be selected for the presidency of the new party was no easier. As a result, they put the presidency on the back burner and set up an interim presidential committee, agreeing to choose the president through an election after the party had been formed. Thus, the difficulty-fraught conservative merger was completed, and Japan's first unified right-wing party, the Liberal Democratic Party, was born. Miki, Hatoyama, Ono, and Taketora Ogata shared the interim presidential committee, and five months later Hatoyama was inaugurated as president of the Liberal Democratic Party. On the future of the Liberal Democratic Party, which had gotten off the ground leaving the most vexatious conflicts unresolved, Miki is well known for his assessment that the party "would be lucky to last two or three years".&lt;ref&gt;Kent E. Calder, Crisis and Compensation: Public Policy and Political Stability in Japan, 1949-1986 (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1988), 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Miki was bedridden from April 1956, and his condition gradually worsened. On 4 July he died at his home in [[Meguro, Tokyo]]. The cause of death was stomach cancer. He was 71 years old.

A bronze statue of Miki was constructed near [[Ritsurin Garden]] in his hometown of Takamatsu.

== Famous statements and retorts ==
During the 1917 general elections, in which Miki would be elected for the first time, the Rikken Seiyukai candidate Zenshiro Tsuboya said of Miki in a speech, "I'm not going to name names, but there is a certain candidate who has two years worth of unpaid rent. He even owes more than one year's worth of debt to the rice merchant. Can such a man really discuss state affairs at the podium of parliament as a representative of our nation? I believe that such a candidate in these circumstances should gracefully decline to run for office." At the next town hall meeting Miki hit back, saying "I've heard that a certain candidate has been going around attacking as disgraceful the fact that a man with debts is running for office. That debt-ridden candidate is I, the humble Bukichi Miki. Because I am poor, I am in debt. Though he was just called a rice merchant, that man is the rice merchant Mr. Yamashita from Yamabuki. It was said that I owe him more than one year's worth of debt, but that's not correct. Actually, I owe him more than two years' worth of debt. I also owe rent, but not two years' worth. To be more precise, the situation is that my landlord has been waiting for payment for more than three years. I want to correct this misinformation about me right now!" The room burst into laughter and applause and one person shouted "Nice one, debt king!" Miki's landlord and the rice merchant Tatsujiro Yamashita were also present at the meeting and after that they both stood up at Miki's urging. Yamashita said, "I am the rice merchant Yamashita. How about it everyone, will you please support Mr. Miki?" That was the last time the stunned Zenshiro Tsuboya would bring up Miki's debts.&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 43rd session of the Imperial Diet which began on 29 June 1920, [[Korekiyo Takahashi]], the [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Finance Minister]] in [[Takashi Hara]]'s cabinet who went by the nickname "Daruma", was in the process of explaining the naval budget. When Takahashi said "We will make this into a long-term plan of ten years for the army and eight years for the navy", Miki shouted out "Nine years for Daruma!" This was a very witty statement using the story of the Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma|Daruma Daishi]] who faced a wall in China's Shaolin Monastery and after doing zen meditation for nine years, achieved enlightenment. The assemblymen burst into laughter and Takahashi also stopped speaking, looked back at Prime Minister Hara in the ministers' gallery, and smiled wryly. Even Takaaki Kato and Osachi Hamaguchi, up to then well known for their stoic seriousness, famously cracked up in their seats.&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the time when Hara was serving as prime minister, a cabinet minister was explaining the aims of a proposed piece of legislation in a somber and monotone voice as if reading a sutra. When the session adjourned Miki jeered "Next we may burn the incense", and the assembly burst out laughing.

At a meeting of MPs from the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association]] for deciding party policy towards the [[Hideki Tojo|Tojo]] cabinet's Corporate Restructuring Bill, [[Seigo Nakano]] pointed at the senior members of the IRAPA and remarked "Swarming around the center of power, I see only sycophants. This will in the end lead to the destruction of our country. The people who are leading Japan astray are all the bootlickers in the IRAPA." When the mainstream IRAPA members booed Nakano, Miki abruptly stood up and famously shouted "Shut up, all you bootlickers!", and the hecklers immediately fell silent.&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a speaking event Miki attended during the general elections of 1952, a rival office-seeker, Toshichi Fuke, said of Miki "After the war, we achieved [[Women's suffrage#Japan|equal rights for men and women]], but even so one big-shot candidate keeps four mistresses! Is such an immoral man qualified to be involved in national politics?" Miki. however, was the next one up to the podium, and he replied "The person that the impotent candidate who stands before me calls a 'big-shot candidate' is the humble Bukichi Miki. What Bukichi Miki is thinking is, would you all prefer to give your one precious vote to this pitifully weak candidate, or to a big-shot like me? What's more, because I must strive for accuracy, I will go ahead and correct the mathematical errors of the aforementioned weak candidate right now. It was said that I have four mistresses, but actually I have five. Confusing four with five ought to be considered shameful even for a first grader. It seems like he failed to count one. However, all these women have now become old maids and aren't of use to me anymore. Even so, Bukichi Miki could never do something so inhumane as abandon them! Even today I care for them all." The crowd roared with laughter and approval.&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 257-259.&lt;/ref&gt; Miki kept his five mistresses up to his death, who lived with him and cared for his wife Kaneko. However, he was also a loving husband who had stated, "The one for whom I have never stopped feeling true affection is definitely my wife Kaneko. It's just that I happened to fall in love with other women."&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Miki was serving as Chairman of the Executive Council of the Democratic Party, the [[Shiun Maru disaster]] occurred, a deadly collision between two [[Japanese National Railways]] ferries, resulting in the resignation of JNR President Sonosuke Nagasaki. Miki proposed [[Shinji Sogo]], who had a long career as a bureaucrat in the pre-war [[Japanese Government Railways]], to fill his shoes and met him personally to persuade him. At the meeting Miki aggressively approached the wavering Sogo and said "Our railway department, which has always been like a home to you, is probably on the verge of collapse due to these scandals. Are you so disloyal that you won't even try to stand and fight for your homeland when called upon?" This led Sogo to answer "I will never be a traitor!" and convinced him to take up the post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifsa.jp/index.php?Gsogoshinji article on Shinji Sogo - Kogaku Shimbun International Foreign Students Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burn rate''' is the rate at which a company is losing money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.capshare.com/blog/burn-rate-101/|title=Burn Rate 101: How to Calculate and Understand Burn Rate [Downloadable Excel Model Included] - Capshare Blog|date=2016-06-22|website=Capshare Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is typically expressed in monthly terms.  E.g., "the company's burn rate is currently $65,000 per month."  In this sense, the word "burn" is a synonymous term for negative [[cash flow]]. It is also measure for how fast a company will use up its shareholder capital.&lt;ref name="forbes_20130104"&gt;Ehrenberg, David. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2013/01/04/is-your-company-dangerously-rushing-to-scale/ "Is Your Company Dangerously Rushing To Scale?"] ''Forbes.com'' January 4, 2013. Retrieved on May 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; If the shareholder capital is exhausted, the company will either have to start making a profit, find additional funding, or close down.

The term came into common use during the [[dot-com era]] when many start-up companies went through several stages of funding before emerging into profitability and positive cash flows and thus becoming self-sustainable (or, as for the majority, failing to find additional funding and sustainable business models and thus going bankrupt). In between funding events, burn rate becomes an important management measure, since together with the available funds, it provides a time measure to when the next funding event needs to take place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Conway]] and [[Mike Maples]], [http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=1902 lecture and discussion with science and engineering entrepreneurship students], [[Stanford Entrepreneurship Corner]], 2008.01.23&lt;/ref&gt;

Some entrepreneurs and investors say that part of the reasons behind the [[dot-com bust]] was the unsound management and financial investor practices to keep the burn rate up, taking it as a proxy for how fast the start-up company was acquiring a customer base.

The term '''burn rate''' can also refer to how quickly individuals spend their money, particularly their [[discretionary income]]. For example, Mackenzie Investments commissioned a test to gauge the spending and saving behavior of Canadians to determine if they are “Overspenders.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialpost.com/money/rrsp/story.html?id=290425 Financial Post Story&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205192051/http://www.financialpost.com/money/rrsp/story.html?id=290425 |date=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In project management ==

Aside from financing, the term '''burn rate''' is also used in [[project management]] to determine the rate at which hours (allocated to a project) are being used, to identify when work is going out of scope, or when efficiencies are being lost. Simply put, the burn rate of any project is the rate at which the project budget is being burned (spent).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/the-project-scorecard The Project Scorecard]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[earned value management]], burn rate is calculated via the formula, 1/CPI, where CPI stands for Cost Performance Index, which is equal to Earned Value / Actual Cost.

== Other uses ==
The term burn rate is also used in a number of scientific settings:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.capshare.com/blog/burn-rate-101/|title=Burn Rate 101: How to Calculate and Understand Burn Rate [Downloadable Excel Model Included] - Capshare Blog|date=2016-06-22|website=Capshare Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In biology, it can refer to a person's basic metabolic rate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthandwellness.bluecrossmn.com/InteractiveTools/Calculators/41,CalorieBurnCalc|title=Calorie Burn Rate Calculator|last=|first=|date=June 22, 2016|website=Calorie Burn Rate Calculator|publisher=Blue Cross Minnesota|access-date=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In rocketry, it can refer to the rate at which a rocket is burning fuel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/burnrate.html|title=Richard Nakka's Experimental Rocketry Site|website=www.nakka-rocketry.net|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4217">The '''''Canadian Football Act''''' (1974), also known in its long title as '''''An Act respecting Canadian Professional Football''''', was a proposed [[Act of Parliament|Act]] by the [[Parliament of Canada]] in April 1974 designed to give a government-protected [[monopoly]] over [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional]] [[Canadian football|football]] in Canada to the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). Although it was never signed into law, the move by the government eventually compelled the [[World Football League]]'s [[Toronto Northmen]] to move to the [[United States]] as the [[Memphis Southmen]]. The spectre of the Act was again raised when [[John F. Bassett]], the owner of the Northmen/Southmen franchise, proposed a [[United States Football League]] franchise for [[Hamilton, Ontario]], in 1983.

In 2007, there was speculation that a similar act would develop if the [[National Football League]] attempted to [[National Football League in Toronto|expand to Toronto]] and thus threaten the Canadian league's existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/64892 NFL's New Hot Market Is North of the Border - October 19, 2007 - The New York Sun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Such an act would likely still allow for an NFL team to play in Canada in an NFL preseason game and the CFL's off season; thus allowing for a Canadian city to host the Super Bowl if the NFL decided to host their premier event in a stadium far from an NFL city.{{citation needed|date = December 2018}}

It is also unlikely that any future act will be passed to affect American college football, such as the [[NCAA]] and [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], who have or have had teams based in Canada  ([[Simon Fraser University]] being the lone NCAA member in Canada) and bowl games hosted in Canadian cities, with no opposition, in part because the CFL draws some of its players from American college teams (and, in the case of bowl games, because their December and January scheduling is well after [[U Sports football|Canadian university football]] ends its season).

==Details==
* Designated C-22.
* Introduced by the [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Minister of Health]], [[Marc Lalonde]].
* Claimed it would protect the Canadian Football League, would allow the CFL to grow and develop its own distinct character
* Of the mayors of the nine CFL cities at the time, only three were against the ''Canadian Football Act''. They were the mayors of [[List of mayors of Vancouver|Vancouver]], [[List of mayors of Montreal|Montreal]] and [[List of Toronto mayors|Toronto]], also the biggest cities of Canada then and now, with two of them hosting teams from leagues that played a different code of football. Montreal played host to one of the [[World League of American Football]] teams, the [[Montréal Machine]], in the early 1990s after their CFL team folded in the late 1980s. Toronto were hosts to an [[Arena Football League]] team for two seasons, the [[Toronto Phantoms]].
* After the bill passed second reading in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], it was given to the Standing Committee on Health, Welfare and Social Affairs, where it effectively died after the Northmen moved to Memphis.
* Clause 6 in the ''Act'' stated that no person that owns, operates, or manages a team in a league foreign from the CFL shall play in Canada. Subsection 2 stated that no player or member of the said team shall play in Canada, therefore if the bill passed and became law, it would effectively kill teams like the Northmen.

These facts were gathered from the actual debates held in the House of Commons from April 10 to April 28, 1974.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1636">'''Delfim Ferreira''' (1888-1960) was an important Portuguese entrepreneur, born in the town of Riba d'Ave, [[Vila Nova de Famalicão|Vila Nova de Famalição]]. He was the son of the great Portuguese industrial [[Narciso Ferreira]], who, from a small manual mill, built the largest textile enterprise that existed in Portugal in the second half of the nineteenth century.

Educated at the  Royal and Imperial School of Reichenberg, Delfim Ferreira, in the 1940s, intended to build a commercial shopping mall in [[Porto]]. Delfim Ferreira expanded their business to other economic sectors, including the hydroelectric power and the civil construction, contributing to the development of [[Ave (intermunicipal community)|Vale do Ave]] and providing employment to many thousands of workers.

He was awarded with the Grand Cross of the Order of Industrial Merit, the Military Order of Christ, the Great Officership of the Order of Industrial Merit and the Golden Medal of the city of Vila do Conde. When he died in 1960, Delfim Ferreira was considered to be the richest man in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.predialferreira.pt/empresa/fundador] Predial Ferreira &amp; Filhos Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5132">'''EnergyCAP''' is a family of [[energy management software|energy management]] and [[energy accounting software]] products, used for tracking, managing, processing, reporting, benchmarking, and analyzing utility bills and energy and sustainability information. EnergyCAP also interfaces with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] [[Energy Star]] Portfolio Manager. Multiple versions of EnergyCAP -- Enterprise, Express, and Professional -- are available to meet user functional requirements.

== History ==

EnergyCAP's history dates back to 1980. In response to a growing demand for energy management software when PCs were in their infancy, Steven D. Heinz founded OmniComp, Inc. in 1980 and launched the development of EnergyCAP predecessor FASER Energy Accounting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyeducation.com/NewsPress/tabid/63/newsid409/33/Default.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; FASER was first commercially released in 1982 for utility bill verification, tracking and reporting, and the calculation of the cost avoidance attributable to energy management activities (also called [[Measurement and Verification|Measurement &amp; Verification]]). The City of Denver also uses this software to track energy usage throughout their parks system. 

FASER became widely used by retail chains, government, universities, school districts and property managers. By the mid-1990s, FASER's thousands of users tracked an estimated five million bills a year valued at $2 billion. FASER and OmniComp were purchased by [[Enron|Enron Corporation]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/footprint/10K/Enron-1998-10-K-d.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Enron's bankruptcy in late 2001, Heinz acquired the energy information assets&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=178/pagename=alpha_list]&lt;/ref&gt; and launched Good Steward Software, which was renamed to EnergyCAP, Inc. in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/good-steward-software-announces-record-sales-in-2009-changes-name-to-energycap-inc-80720647.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The team developed a new line of energy efficiency software products called EnergyCAP. EnergyCAP, Inc. is a five-time [[Energy Star]] Partner of the Year.

== Software Versions ==

EnergyCAP Enterprise is software for large organizations with comprehensive energy information management needs. Users include Fortune 1,000 companies; universities; military; and city, county, and state governments. EnergyCAP Express is utility bill and energy management software for small to medium-sized organizations like colleges, towns, and small- to medium-sized businesses. EnergyCAP Professional is oriented toward measurement and verification of energy savings for certain qualifying organizations, most notably school districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=413/pagename=alpha_list]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software Features ==

EnergyCAP offers the following features: Account Tracking, [[Accounting software|Accounts Payable or G/L Export]], Bill Accruals, Bill Audits, Electronic Bills from Vendor, Energy Contract Administration, Issue Tracker, Workflow Management, Benchmarking Charts, Budgets &amp; Forecasts,  [[Measurement and Verification|Cost Avoidance (M&amp;V)]], Energy Procurement, Rate/Tariff Analysis, Weather Data, Automated Report Distribution, Custom Spreadsheets for Data Export, Energy Dashboard, PowerViews, Reports, TreeView Navigation, Energy Star Benchmarking, [[Greenhouse gas|Greenhouse Gas Emissions]], Bill Splits, Move-In Utility Vacant Expense Recovery (MUVER), [[Utility submeter|Submeters]] &amp; Chargebacks, Interval (Time-Series) Data, Meter Data Import, [[Microsoft SQL Server]], Unlimited Number of Users, Customizable User Permissions, Data Import Templates, Implementation Services, and Setup Wizards.

'''George H. Hermann''' (6 August 1843 – 21 October 1914) was an entrepreneur based in Houston, Texas. He served the Confederacy in the American Civil War. He was a dealer in wood products and cattle. He invested in real estate and was an early investor in oilfields around [[Humble, Texas]], which led to a financial windfall from a rich oil strike. He donated most of his estate to the public upon his death, including land for the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and Hermann Park. Land and other assets funded the Hermann Hospital Foundation.

==Early life==
George Henry Hermann was born on 6 August 1843 to John and Fannie (Mitchell) Hermann in Houston.&lt;ref name=HTO&gt;{{cite web|author=Muir, Andrew Forest|title=Hermann, George Henry|series=Handbook of Texas Online|url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fhe28|publisher=Texas State Historical Commission|access-date=11 July 2018|date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents were natives of Davos, Switzerland. His father fought in the Battle of Waterloo and traveled to the United States before marrying. John and Fannie traveled to the United States and Mexico before settling in Houston in 1838. John worked as a baker and in the dairy business while accumulating real estate along the way. George was one of seven children, though the only one who survived his youth.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Lewis Publishing Company|year=1895|location=Chicago|pages=390–391|title=History of Texas, Together with a Biographical History of the Cities of Houston and Galveston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Entrepreneurship Monitor''' (GEM) research project is an annual assessment of the national level of entrepreneurial activity in multiple, diverse countries. Based in London, England, GEM is now the largest ongoing study of entrepreneurial dynamics in the world.

==Contents==
The main indicator used is called TEA (Total Early-Stage Entrepreneurial Activity), which assess the percent of working age population both about to start an entrepreneurial activity, and that have started one from a maximum of 3 years and half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q174u468257u355k/|title=Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Economic Growth: Evidence from GEM data | doi=10.1007/s11187-005-2000-1 | volume=24|journal=Small Business Economics|pages=335–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GEM Data==
The data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemconsortium.org/Data-Collection|title=GEM Global Entrepreneurship Monitor|work=GEM Global Entrepreneurship Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for the GEM is collected from two large surveys, the Adult Population Survey (APS) and the National Expert Survey (NES).  The APS surveys at least 2000* adults of each country covered by the GEM and covers the entrepreneurial aspirations of the country's population.  The NES surveys a group of business and academic experts in each country with a broad range of specialties for concrete measures of country's institutional factors.

Each year, the GEM assembles the survey of a minimum of 2000* adults and at least 36 experts from a country of interest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Reports|url=http://www.gemconsortium.org/report}}&lt;/ref&gt; into an annual report. That report comes in a downloadable PDF format. In the 2014 report, 206,000 adults from around the world anonymously participated along with 3,936 national experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 GEM Report|url=http://www.gemconsortium.org/report|website=The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each report published is different than the last but all annual reports include a section on the global perspective on entrepreneurship for the year. *depending on the population and the economic diversity of each country.

==The GEM Model==
The GEM data is used to produce a larger model connecting a series of Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions (EFC) to the TEA, entrepreneurial aspirations, technical progress, GDP growth, and other macro economics variables.  The EFCs reflect institutional factors with theoretic connections to entrepreneurship and are produced using data from the NES.

The original GEM model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemconsortium.org/Model|title=GEM Global Entrepreneurship Monitor|work=GEM Global Entrepreneurship Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; was revised to reflect stages of development to generalize the model's explanation to all countries.  The methodology in doing so was based on a paper by Michael E. Porter, Jeffrey D. Sachs, and John W. MacArthur&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/Sachs%20Writing/2002/WorldEconomicForum_2001-2002_GlobalCompetitivenessReport2001-2002_ExecutiveSummary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect the differences in needed institutions at different points in a country's economic development.

'''Hugo Omar Cóccaro''' (born in 1954) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Justicialist Party]] (PJ) politician, former governor of [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego Province]] (formally Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica, and South Atlantic Islands).

Born in [[Saladillo, Buenos Aires|Saladillo]], [[Buenos Aires Province]], Cóccaro relocated to Tierra del Fuego at age 20 with his brother, with whom he started a construction firm.&lt;ref name=monitor&gt;[http://weblogs.clarin.com/elecciones-2007/archives/2007/06/un-bonaerense-un-chaqueno-y-una-rosarina-van-por-la-gobernacion-de.html ''Clarín: Monitor electoral] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later purchased the San Justo Estancia, a [[Nothofagus pumilio|lenga beech]] sawmill near [[Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego|Río Grande]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1998/04/13/e-06104d.htm ''Clarín''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had four daughters, and his marriage ended in separation.&lt;ref name=monitor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/06/20/elpais/p-01001.htm ''Clarín'': a río revuelto, ganancia de pescadores] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cóccaro entered politics in 2003, when he was elected vice-governor under Governor [[Jorge Colazo]] of the [[Radical Civic Union]] (UCR).  He fell out with Colazo, however, and there were public rows between them. He became acting governor of Tierra del Fuego on October 25, 2005, when Colazo was suspended, and was confirmed in the post on December 2.

His tenure was marked for its failed support for RENASA, a provincial [[petroleum]] concern, and a subsequent [[impeachment]] attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiempofueguino.com.ar/cms/tiempofueguino_sp/ ''Tiempo Fuegino''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cóccaro ran for reelection in 2007, and won the first round; but he was defeated in the runoff by [[Fabiana Ríos]], the first woman to be elected governor in the history of Argentina.

'''Jean-Claude Decaux''' (15 September 1937 – 27 May 2016)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-croix.com/France/Jean-Claude-Decaux-pere-de-l-Abribus-et-roi-de-l-affichage-publicitaire-est-decede-2016-05-27-1300763417 Jean-Claude Decaux, père de l'Abribus et roi de l'affichage publicitaire, est mort] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French entrepreneur who earned his fortune in advertising.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_Jean-Claude-Decaux-family_JBTR.html Forbes profile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=8154824&amp;ticker=DEC:FP&amp;previousCapId=22915440&amp;previousTitle=Sarrau%20Thomas%20Couderc BusinessWeek]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder and honorary chair of the advertising firm [[JCDecaux]], which is now run by his sons, [[Jean-François Decaux]] and [[Jean-Charles Decaux]].&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="businessweek"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Jean-Claude Decaux was the son of a shoe salesman in Beauvais, France.&lt;ref name=newyork&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married with three children and lived in Paris.&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

His death was announced on 27 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/27/news/companies/jean-claude-decaux-dies/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-27/outdoor-advertising-pioneer-jean-claude-decaux-dies-at-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At the age of 18, inspired by an argument with his father over the family shoe store's window display, Jean-Claude started a business creating billboards along French roadways.&lt;ref name=newyork&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, legislation in France placed restrictions on billboard use which forced Decaux out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/59/JCDecaux-S-A.html | title=History of JCDecaux S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded JCDecaux in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=International Directory of Company Histories | volume=76 | page=213 | editor=Tina Grant | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UskAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a deal with the city of Lyon, proposing that he would build bus shelters and keep them clean in exchange for advertising space there. The company quickly expanded to other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Ascent of Media: From Gilgamesh to Google via Gutenberg | author= Roger Parry | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieVEXO6FQm4C&amp;pg=PT125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Decaux personally designed the [[Sanisette | Sanisette public toilet]], a self-cleaning public toilet, as a replacement for the [[Pissoir | '''pissoirs''']] of Paris.&lt;ref name=newyork&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Toilet Wars | author=Peter Hellman | page=42 | journal=New York Magazine | date=May 3, 1993 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EiEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Inclusive Urban Design: Public Toilets | author=Clara Greed | page=80 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sW3_7Zzn_4C&amp;pg=PA80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, according to ''[[Forbes]]'', he had a net worth of $6.2 billion.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Claude Decaux|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/jean-claude-decaux/|website=Forbes|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the son of German industrialist [[:de:Hans Welsch|Hans Welsch]] and, on his mother's side, the grandson of European statesman [[:de:Johannes Hoffmann|Johannes Hoffmann]].&lt;ref&gt;John Slof, "DSD Dillinger Stahlbau GmbH (A)", Case Study #0-390-033, DG-944-E, IESE International Graduate School of Management, Barcelona-Madrid, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; His professional approach to music production is based on his background as [[business school]] academic. He began his career teaching executive programs in [[Europe]] before entering the music industry in [[North America]]. A percussionist since the 1970s, he has been performing regularly with a large collection of gongs both as a solo performer or in collaboration with other artists since 1994.&lt;ref name= "Bergen"&gt;"Bancroft percussion musician uses gongs." by Werner Bergen in ''The Examiner'', Peterborough, Ontario, March 30, 2007, p.

==Management &amp; Management Education: 1990-2000==
Upon studying economics at the [[University of Miami]] and management at [[IESE]], the University of Navarra's Graduate School of Management,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ffi.org/?page=bestdissertation FFI Best Doctoral Dissertation Award], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Welsch completed a post-doctorate year at [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] in 1991. His writings in the early 1990s applied social systems analysis to organizational dynamics. Much of his work focused on family firms, then an emerging field of investigation. From 1991 to 1993 Welsch served as the Director of Postgraduate Studies at the Universitätsseminar der Wirtschaft (USW) at [[:de:Schloss Gracht|Gracht Castle]] near Cologne, Germany, where he taught executive programs. During the second half of the decade Welsch grew critical of management education and academia in general as evidenced by the publication "Reflections on Professional Cynicism in Education and the Management of Education Organisations“. From 1993 to 1997 he served on the Supervisory Board of DSD Dillinger Stahlbau GmbH in Germany. From 1996 to 1999 Welsch was an International Fellow at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;Sources for this time period include:

==Performing &amp; Recording Artist: 1994-Present==

===Work with Gongs===
[[File:Gong Panorama at the Dunrobin Sonic Gym, July 11, 2008, small.jpg|thumb|Gong Panorama at the Dunrobin Sonic Gym]]
Welsch has been recording and performing with a large collection of gongs since 1994.&lt;ref name= "Bergen" /&gt; In approaching the gong he pays special attention to the instrument's dynamic range and frequency spectrum. He typically develops soundscapes which come out of and return to silence. While the amplitude increases the gong gradually unfolds its frequency spectrum, beginning with low frequencies (fundamental), and subsequently develops a wide array of overtones (harmonics). He prefers large acoustic spaces for his performances.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Welsch's commentary of the  [http://www.drumsoloartist.com/cgi-bin/news/news.pl?record=38 "Cymbal Setup Of The Year"] on the online drummer collective www.DrumSoloArtist.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Keillor quotes Welsch in her album liner notes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound Creation Album===
His album [http://www.deeplistening.org/site/content/sound-creation-johannes-welsch "Sound Creation"], an example of his solo performances, features the entire [http://www.drumsoloartist.com/Site/Cymbal_Setup.html "Sound Creation series of gongs"] made by [[Paiste]]. Released on the Deep Listening label in 2012 the album received a number of favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include:
* Ed Pinsent in [http://www.thesoundprojector.com ''The Sound Projector Magazine''], April 10, 2012
* FdW in [http://modisti.com/12/2012/04/18/vital-weekly-827/#ixzz2SyxmJ2vR ''Vital Weekly''], # 827, April 18, 2012
* Julien Héraud in [http://www.improv-sphere.blogspot.ca ''improv sphere''], May 17, 2012
* Joseph Burnett in [http://www.dustedmagazine.com ''Dusted Magazine''], June 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Music writer [http://jpburnett.com Joseph Burnett] notes about the production:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Using a series of differently-sized gongs, Johannes Welsch has created a deeply resonant piece of minimal drone, as profound and overwhelming as the best deep listening by his mentor Pauline Oliveros.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Phimister/obscure_alternatives__unsung_masterpieces_and_underappreciated_gems/3/ "Obscure alternatives, unsung masterpieces and underappreciated gems."], a compilation by Joseph Burnett published on ''www.RateYourMusic.com'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The album credits include [[Anton Kwiatkowski]] (engineering), [[:de:Elaine Keillor|Elaine Keillor]] (liner notes), [[Louis Helbig]] (photography), and Scott O'Toole (mastering).

'''Jorge Omar Sobisch''' (born January 16, 1943) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] centre-right politician, formerly governor of [[Neuquén Province]]. He leads the [[Neuquén People's Movement]] and was a candidate for [[President of Argentina]] in 2007.

==Biography==
Sobisch was born in [[Buenos Aires]] and moved to [[Neuquén, Argentina|Neuquén]] as a young boy with the military family of his father, [[Carlos Sobisch]]. He studied in Neuquén and Buenos Aires, then moved to [[Trelew]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]] as a young man to work in a friend's design company. He became a graphics operator and [[typesetter]], later establishing his own company. He completed his military service in [[Sarmiento, Chubut]].

Sobisch assisted his [[Peronist]] father in founding the [[Neuquén People's Movement]] in 1961, following him into politics. The party won the Neuquén city elections in 1983 after the return of democracy and Sobisch became mayor, taking took a leading role in renewing the party. He also led the [[Independiente de Neuquén|Club Atlético Independiente]] [[football club]] from 1971.

Sobisch was elected governor of the province in 1991, serving until 1995. He took over the leadership of the party in 1997. He won again as governor in 1999 and 2003, with 57% of the vote, his term expiring in 2007 when he stepped down. 

Sobisch led the founding of the Movement of the United Provinces, a new, conservative party, and was the movement's candidate for the Presidency in 2007. He had previously formed a centre-right alliance with [[Mauricio Macri]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/Archivo/nota.asp?nota_id=688802&amp;aplicacion_id=12 ''La Nación'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; although it did not survive Macri's alliance with [[Ricardo López Murphy]] (who is not on good terms with Sobisch); López Murphy was a conservative presidential candidate in both 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-62562-2006-02-04.html ''Página/12'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/Archivo/nota.asp?nota_id=818595 ''La Nación'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Remerafuentealba.JPG|left|thumb|160px|A T-shirt commemorates the assassinated school teacher, Carlos Fuentealba.]]

Sobisch is also seen as an ally of former [[Justicialist Party]] President [[Carlos Menem]] and had hoped to become the candidate of those Peronists opposed to President [[Néstor Kirchner]]. Following a scandal in his home province, concerning the April 7 death of local teachers' union member [[w:es:Carlos Fuentealba|Carlos Fuentealba]] (who was reportedly fired upon by provincial police during a protest despite being unarmed), Sobisch was largely shunned by disgruntled Peronists who mainly backed [[Alberto Rodríguez Saá]]. Sobisch was, however, backed by crime victims' rights activist [[Juan Carlos Blumberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/10/13/elpais/p-01518644.htm ''Clarín'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Sobisch and his running mate, [[Jorge Asís]], gained 284,161 votes in the [[Argentine general election, 2007|presidential elections]], amounting to 1.56% of the national vote, in sixth place. His wife of 38 years, Liliana Planas, died on December 22, 2009, after falling from their ninth story Neuquén apartment building, in what local coroners determined to be a suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/12/22/um/m-02105990.htm ''Clarín'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Langdi''' was a [[Writing system|script]] commonly used by traders used to write [[Haryanvi language|Haryanvi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], or [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] .&lt;ref name="The Tribune"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040302/haryana.htm#17| title = ‘Langdi Hindi’ on the verge of extinction|publisher = [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|accessdate = 2009-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bookkeepers]], known as munīm ({{lang-hi|मुनीम}}, {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|مُنیم}}}}), would also keep records in this script.&lt;ref name="The Tribune"/&gt;

Some scholars have claimed that Langdi is a form of [[Mahajani]] for writing in parts of [[Haryana]]. Its proper connection must be more thoroughly explored.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2011/11274-n4126-mahajani.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many '''advertising characters''' used as [[mascots]] and characters by companies in Australia and New Zealand are similar to those used in the [[List of American advertising characters|United States]] and the [[List of European and British advertising characters|United Kingdom]]. There are, however, quite a number that are unique to these two nations.

Many advertisements shown on New Zealand television are made in Australia, and many Australian and New Zealand companies operate similar businesses on both sides of the [[Tasman Sea]]. As such, there is considerable overlap in advertising characters and mascots found in the two countries.

The following is a list of notable mascots and characters created specifically for [[advertising]] purposes in Australia and New Zealand, listed alphabetically by the [[Product (business)|product]] they represent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1720">A '''loan note''' is a type of [[financial instrument]]; it is a [[contract]] for a [[loan]] that specifies when the loan must be repaid and usually also the interest payable. It is similar to a [[promissory note]] but the differences can be significant in terms of consequences, especially tax consequences. Chief of these is that by specifying the interest payable, the lender may obtain a tax shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/4-107-6780 |title=Practical Law |publisher=Uk.practicallaw.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loan notes are simple but important instruments in business and finance. A loan note can also be conceived of as a form of deferred payment, and in the UK the tax treatment of loan notes is as either ‘qualifying corporate bonds’ (QCBs), which provide a tax shield, or as ‘non-qualifying corporate bonds’ (non-QCBs) Loan notes may contain other provisions such as convertibility into equity or other kinds of debt, in which case they are called "convertible loan notes". The loan note is one of the most widely used instruments in financing the entrepreneurial venture and in [[Startup company|start-ups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlapiper.com/~/media/Files/Insights/Publications/2014/06/Technology%20Start%20ups.pdf |format=PDF |title=Start-Up Pack : DLA Piper |publisher=Dlapiper.com |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''McAvoy Brewing Company''' (founded in 1865 as '''Bemis &amp; Rindge Brewery''' by Henry V. Bemis) was run by [[John H. McAvoy]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] and was one of Chicago's largest breweries before Prohibition.&lt;ref name="McAvoyObit"&gt;"His Labors Ended - John H. McAvoy passes the portals of eternity", Chicago Tribune July 25th, 1893&lt;/ref&gt;  Coinciding with the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] going into effect on January 16, 1920, the brewery closed in 1920.&lt;ref name="chicagology"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mcavoybrewery.jpg|thumb|McAvoy Brewery on 24th Street and South Park]]

===Early history===
In 1865, the brewery began in a three-story brick building close to the corner of [[Near South Side, Chicago|South Park Avenue and 23rd Street]] along [[Lake Michigan]]. In the early 1870s, a [[malt house]] was constructed next to the original building, along with 4 [[Ice house (building)|ice houses]] on the western side of the avenue in 1872, 1874, 1875, and 1876. In 1878 and 1879, two more ice houses were constructed on the east side of South Park Avenue. A substantial brick [[barn]] was built in 1878 and office building was built in 1879.&lt;ref name="chicagology"/&gt;

In 1901, the company employed over one hundred men and the chief brewer was Fritz Hieronimus. Hieronimus learned the trade in [[Germany]] at [[Deutsches Brauereimuseum|Frankfort-on-the-Main]], a well known school for brewers at the time. In 1890, Hieronimus was elected as an honorary members of the [[Brewers Association|United States Brewmasters' Association]].&lt;ref name="MBAA"&gt;{{cite web|title=District Philadelphia History Nov. 15, 1890 Western Brewer|url=http://www.mbaa.com/districts/Philadelphia/about/history/Pages/history1890WesternBrewer.aspx|website=mbaa.com|publisher=Master Brewers Association of Americas|accessdate=15 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215001358/http://www.mbaa.com/districts/Philadelphia/about/history/Pages/history1890WesternBrewer.aspx|archivedate=15 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until 1882, the officers of the company were:&lt;ref name="chicagology"&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Years of Brewing, Western Brewer, August, 1901|url=https://chicagology.com/breweries/|website=chicagology.com|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McAvoy involvement===
From 1882 until 1920, [[John H. McAvoy]] was president of the company.&lt;ref name="chicagology"/&gt; McAvoy was the brother-in-law of Peter Leyendecker, who came from Germany in 1882 with his family to work with McAvoy. Leyendecker was the father of American illustrators [[J.C. Leyendecker]] and [[Frank X. Leyendecker]].&lt;ref name="NYTimesObit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=New York Times Staff|title=J.C.

McAvoy was instrumental and securing funding to return [[John Brown's Fort]] back to [[West Virginia]]&lt;ref name="bob"&gt;Skilnik, Bob. ''Beer - A History of Brewing in Chicago''. Barricade Books, 2006, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; after it had been brought to Chicago in 1892 for display at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].&lt;ref name="Number 2 1958 pp. 93"/&gt;  In 1893, in-house bottling was installed and McAvoy was among the largest breweries in Chicago.&lt;ref name="chicagology"/&gt;

===Prohibition===
As the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition movement]] began, the cultural landscape changed and the business began a downturn. In 1920, the Brewery closed, which coincided with the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] going into effect on January 16, 1920.&lt;ref name="chicagology"/&gt;

A '''performance supervision system''' ('''PSS''') is a [[software system]] used to improve the performance of a [[Industrial process|process]] [[Factory|plant]].  Typical process plants include [[oil refineries]], [[paper mills]], and [[chemical plant]]s.

The PSS gathers real-time data from the [[process control]] system, typically a [[distributed control system]].  Using this data, the PSS can calculate performance [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] for process equipment, controls, and operations.

==Biography==
Mr. Appel has a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[economics]] and [[computer science]] from [[Brandeis University]] and a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[transportation]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=rita/&gt;

He worked for the global management consulting firm of A.T. Kearney, Inc., where he led business improvement initiatives for clients in the private and public sectors, with a focus on Transportation and Infrastructure.  Mr. Appel has worked in the transportation field since the late 1980s, and has supported organizations in the railroad, trucking, airline, and ocean shipping industries with growth strategy, supply chain improvement, post-merger integration, public-private partnerships, and other key business and policy issues. Previously, he served as the Special Assistant to the Administrator of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], and as Assistant Director for Pricing and Yield Management at [[Amtrak]].&lt;ref name=rita/&gt;

He was confirmed by the [[U.S. Senate]] as Administrator of the [[Research and Innovative Technology Administration]] (RITA) on April 29, 2009.&lt;ref name=rita/&gt; During his tenure at RITA, Appel worked with Secretary [[Ray LaHood]] to advance key [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] (USDOT) initiatives by leveraging effective research and cross-modal coordination. These initiatives have included the Distracted Driving Summit, which brought key transportation researchers, advocates, decision makers and other leaders together to address this growing safety issue; the bolstering of USDOT Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Program to best improve safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability across all modes of surface transportation; and the establishment of the Department's Safety Council.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1706">'''Raymond Pelgrims de Bigard''' (2 April 1875 to 14 May 1955) was a Belgian industrialist, famous for the conservation and restoration of historic castles.&lt;ref&gt;https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/dibe/persoon/6616&lt;/ref&gt;

De Bigard became wealthy at the beginning of the 20th century. During the First World War, however, his activities were destroyed. He gained national fame in rescuing multiple important residences with his private fortune, personally owning multiple castles. In 1903 he bought Bijgaerden Castle, former residence of the [[Lord of Saventhem and Sterrebeke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuinencyclopedie.be/pages/detail.asp?Id=4393 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323102657/http://tuinencyclopedie.be/pages/detail.asp?Id=4393 |archivedate=2016-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He restored the castle long before it became a protected monument in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.be/books?id=rKjn0nQrkzcC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=Raymond+Pelgrims+de+Bigard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ml1NIHvvFH&amp;sig=E5M3-0tjZ3Gf6wVf60oXb2UPnOs&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix_JW5v6_VAhWRKlAKHaiVAI0Q6AEIhgEwFQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Raymond%20Pelgrims%20de%20Bigard&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides [[Groot-Bijgaarden Castle]], he saved [[Beersel Castle]].

In 1934 he founded ''Les Demeures Historiques de Belgique''.&lt;ref&gt;http://anet.ua.ac.be/submit.phtml?UDses=67305290%3A775771&amp;UDstate=1&amp;UDmode=&amp;UDaccess=&amp;UDrou=%25Start:bopwexe&amp;UDopac=isaarua&amp;UDextra=au::107618&lt;/ref&gt;
For his efforts he received royal gratitude.

His son, [[Eugeen-Willy Pelgrims de Bigard]], inherited his castles.

This problem does not occur at the one-country level.&lt;ref name = "Gandolfo 1995"&gt;{{citation

Suppose the number of countries in the world is ''n''. Because this world is closed, one country's [[balance of payments]] surplus must be equal to another's deficit, and vice versa. Thus the sum of all countries' net payments positions must be zero. Therefore, if ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 countries out of ''n'' countries have determined their balances of payments, that of the ''n''th country is determined automatically.&lt;ref name = "Alan 2002"&gt;{{citation
 | author = Alan Professor Winters
 | page = 397
 | location = 
 | publisher = Routledge
 | title = International Economics
 | year = 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This fact implies that, if all of the ''n'' countries have payments objectives, only ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 countries can achieve the payments objectives. In other words, all of the payments objectives can not be achieved simultaneously.

Similarly, if there are ''n'' [[currency|currencies]] in the world, only ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 [[exchange rate]]s can be "independent" because the exchange rate is a price of one money relative to another.&lt;ref name = "Alan 2002" /&gt; Other rates which are not independent are calculated as [[cross rate]]. 

There are only ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 countries  to be determined, which implies the ''n'' th country is required to refrain from intervening its exchange rate. [[Benign neglect]] is one example for this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Winthrop Jones, Peter B.

Mahsouli withdrew his nomination once when the president nominated him for the position of oil minister in 2005 after admitted to [[Iranian parliament]] that he was worth $160 million.&lt;ref name="TB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/08/ahmadinejads-security-cabinet.html|title=Ahmadinejad's Security Cabinet|work=FRONTLINE - Tehran Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, it was announced that Ministry of Welfare will be merged with Ministry of Labour and Mahsouli will be leave cabinet after it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/163501/محرابیان،-محصولی-و-میرکاظمی-از-دولت-حذف-شدند/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahsouli was in charge of the Ministry of Interior when the alleged vote rigging happened in Iran's presidential election in June 2009.

== June 13 Letter ==
On June 18, a letter was presented by Iranian filmmakers [[Marjane Satrapi]] (director of the critically Acclaimed Film [[Persepolis (film)|Persepolis]]) and has since been widely circulated with Mousavi Supporters. No verification of the letter has been provided. The letter was allegedly written by Interior Minister Sadegh Mahsouli to [[Ali Khamenei|Ayatollah Khamenei]] on June 13 (a day after the elections), states the fraud and lists the authentic vote count. A quick view on the letter shows that it was fake. The letter was roughly translated as follows;

"''Salaam Aleikum.''

''Following your concerns regarding the results of the presidential election and per your given discretion to have Dr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remain as president during this sensitive juncture. Therefore, everything has been planned in a way that the public announcement will be made in accordance with the interests of the regime and the revolution. All necessary precautions have been taken to deal with any unexpected events of election aftermath and the intense monitoring of all the parties' leaders as well as the election candidates.''

''However, some believe that the real votes counted are as follows:''

''Total number of votes: 43,026,078''

''Mir Hossein Mousavi: 19,075,623''

''Mehdi Karoubi: 13,387,104''

''Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: 5,698,417''

''Mohsen Rezaee: 3,754,218''

''Void: 38,716''

''Minister of Interior''

''Sadegh Mahsouli''"

He also worked for the African National Congress (ANC) and South African Breweries. He became an ANC Member of Parliament in 1994 but left the legislature in 1996 to become managing director of Transnet Limited, South Africa's largest parastatal, that controls South Africa's rail network and harbours. During this time he was also chairman of South African Airways.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;

'''''SimFarm: SimCity's Country Cousin''''' is a [[video game]] in which players build and manage a virtual [[farm]]. It was developed by [[Maxis]] and released in 1993 as a spin-off of ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]''.

== Gameplay ==
Mirroring duties on a real [[farm]], ''SimFarm'' puts players in charge of building up the land, placing the buildings, buying and selling [[livestock]] and planting [[agriculture|crops]].  A [[weather]] and [[season]] system are in place as well, presenting the same kind of challenges found in a real-world farm.  As with ''[[SimCity]]'', there are [[disaster]]s that can wreak havoc on the player's farm.  [[Tornadoes]], [[drought]]s, [[pest (animal)|pest]]s, and [[dust storm]]s are some of the events that can disrupt farm crops and [[harvests]].

''SimFarm'' also has a small town included in its simulation.  This town is reminiscent of ''SimCity'' in its form and function.  The player may interact with the town occasionally by suggesting new tile types and joining competitions with livestock (such as sending in a prize pig to potentially earn a blue ribbon and a cash prize.) Suggesting an airport to be built in the town will usually cause its construction, thus unlocking the ability to buy and use a crop duster.

The homestead in ''SimFarm'' is where the player lives and is expanded at the beginning of each game year if the player has made enough money in the previous year.

''SimFarm'' allows the player to choose a location derived from the [[Growing region|region]] and climate of one of nine areas of the US or to design one's own climate by selecting average winds, rainfall, and temperatures.

The game package also included a teachers guide to teaching with ''SimFarm'' with black line masters for photo copying for the class and a users manual. These were printed and included in the box.

Equipment is necessary to maintain your farm and bring your crops to harvest. Structures store equipment, livestock, seeds, etc. The minimum equipment required to bring one field to harvest is one tractor, one planter, one plow, one harvester, one truck, and one trailer. The crops are the main revenue-raising item in ''SimFarm''. All crops have specific maturity cycles, water requirements, temperature requirements, and resistance to pests, weeds, and [[Plant disease|diseases]].

There are four types of livestock in ''SimFarm'', all of which have specific food requirements, need water, and breed new livestock. Animals' value can be increased by making a barn available for their use.

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1993 approved of the game's graphics and documentation.

'''''Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work''''' is a 2006 non-fiction book by [[Industrial and organizational psychology|industrial psychologist]] Paul Babiak and [[Criminal psychology|criminal psychologist]] [[Robert D. Hare]]. 

==Contents summary==
The text covers the nature of psychopaths in the context of employment and purports to explain: how psychopaths [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] their way into work and get promoted, the effects of their presence on colleagues and [[corporation]]s, and the superficial similarities (and fundamental differences) between [[leadership]] skills and psychopathic traits. The work is interlaced with fictional [[narratives]] illustrating how the factual content applies to real-life situations. Characteristics of manipulators are described as shifting to meet stereotypical gender expectations: a female psychopath might make full use of the passive, warm, nurturing, and dependent [[sex-role]] stereotype in order to get what she wants out of others and a male psychopath might use a [[Machismo|macho]] image, intimidation, and aggression to achieve satisfaction of his desires. The authors posit that around 1% of senior positions in business are psychopaths.

The authors describe a "five phase model" of how a typical [[workplace psychopath]] climbs to and maintains power: entry, assessment, manipulation, confrontation, and ascension. In the entry stage, the psychopath will use highly developed [[social skills]] and [[Superficial charm|charm]] to obtain employment into an organisation. At this stage it will be difficult to spot anything which is indicative of psychopathic behaviour, and as a new employee you might perceive the psychopath to be helpful and even benevolent. Once on to the assessment stage, the psychopath will weigh you up according to your usefulness, and you could be recognised as either a pawn (who has some informal [[Social influence|influence]] and will be easily manipulated) or a [[Patronage|patron]] (who has formal power and will be used by the psychopath to protect against attacks).

[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulation]] involves the psychopath creating a scenario of “[[Cognitive distortion|psychopathic fiction]]” where positive information about themselves and negative [[disinformation]] about others will be created, where your role as a part of a network of [[Flying monkeys (psychology)|pawns or patrons]] will be utilised and you will be [[Operant conditioning|groomed]] into accepting the psychopath's agenda. Once on to the confrontation stage, the psychopath will use techniques of [[character assassination]] to maintain their agenda, and you will be either discarded as a pawn or used as a patron. Finally, in the ascension stage, the role of the subject as a patron in the psychopath’s quest for power will be discarded, and the psychopath will take for himself/herself a position of power and prestige from anyone who once supported them.

The '''Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute''' or SWF Institute, or SWFI, is a global corporation analyzing public asset owners such as [[sovereign wealth fund]]s and other long-term governmental investors.  Initially, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute focused solely on sovereign wealth funds.  It has branched out to cover all types of public institutional investors.  The institute is a [[financial data vendor]] but provides information to the media as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Susanna|title=Why Norwegians Are Millionaires and Americans Are Paupers |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/norwegians-millionaires-norways-sovereign-wealth-fund/story?id=21488085|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blas|first=Javier|title=Protecting Nigeria oil SWF is no easy task |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/69325c28-2440-11e3-a8f7-00144feab7de.html#axzz2qJ6YUFpy|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abedine|first=Saad|title=Body of Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund chief found |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/30/uae.body/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Michael Maduell]] and Carl Linaburg in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Brad|title=Is there an SWF in your future? |url=http://www.irmagazine.com/articles/shareholder-targeting-id/20204/there-swf-your-future/|publisher=IR Magazine|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SWFI sells data subscriptions to asset managers, banks, researchers, universities, governments, institutional investors, asset owners, corporations, law firms and other entities.

==Transparency Ratings==
The SWFI came out with the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index in 2008.  It is a 10-point scale based on ten principles of transparency, each adding one point to the index rating. The index is used by sovereign wealth funds in their annual reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan ranks among the highest in Transparency Index |url=http://www.oilfund.az/en_US/news/558/100/The-State-Oil-Fund-of-the-Republic-of-Azerbaijan-ranks-among-the-highest-in-Transparency-Index.asp|publisher=SOFAZ|accessdate=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSIA Rated Transparent by Sovereign Wealth Institute |url=http://nsia.com.ng/nsia-rated-transparent-sovereign-wealth-institute/|publisher=Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data==
The SWFI tracks direct deals in sovereign wealth funds.  The value of global direct deals by sovereign-wealth funds hit $50.02 billion in the first half of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunkley|first=Dan |title=Sovereign-Wealth Funds Pump Near Record Amount of Cash in Deals |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/07/sovereign-wealth-funds-pump-near-record-amount-of-cash-in-deals/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SWFI tracks the assets of sovereign wealth funds, pensions, endowments and other asset owners.  Norway's sovereign wealth fund crossed $1 trillion in assets in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Norway’s sovereign-wealth fund passes the $1trn mark |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21729458-5m-odd-norwegians-own-more-1-all-shares-world-norways/|publisher=The Economist|date=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point during the attack on the concertgoers, Paddock – who had placed a baby monitor camera on a service cart outside his room – fired about 200 rounds through his door.

Investigators believe that he was obsessed with cleanliness and possibly had [[bipolar disorder]]. Although a doctor did offer him antidepressants, he only accepted anxiety medication.

==Early life==
The Zagats got married during law school, graduated in 1966, and moved to New York where they became corporate lawyers.&lt;ref name="cityfile"&gt;{{cite news

Later they both got jobs in [[Paris]], he at office of the [[Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed|Hughes Hubbard law firm]] and she at the Shearman &amp; Sterling office.  While there, they started compiling their own list of Parisian restaurants, of what they liked and didn't like, and conceived the idea for a new type of restaurant ratings guide.

==Hobby becomes a business==
When they returned to New York, they solicited the opinions of friends about New York restaurants, and the resulting compilation eventually became [[Zagat Survey|''Zagat'']].&lt;ref name="bosApr09" /&gt; The couple published their first guide in 1982. It was for New York City and it sold 7,500 copies in local bookstores&lt;!-- which?--~~~~ --&gt;.&lt;ref name="cityfile" /&gt;  Two years later, it was selling at 40,000 copies per year and they quit their jobs as corporate lawyers to devote full-time to the enterprise.&lt;ref name="cityfile" /&gt;

==Zagat Survey==
{{main|Zagat Survey}}
One reviewer described the methodology: "The philosophy behind the Zagat Survey is that instead of one lengthy critical review of a restaurant, the eating public is better served by a rating based on hundreds of responses. By tabulating the responses to detailed surveys, the Zagat Survey rates restaurants on a 30-point scale in the categories of food, décor, service and cost. It also provides price estimates and a pithy, paragraph-sized description."&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

The company expanded to include other cities and market segments such as hotels, stores and clubs; in early 2008, the couple tried to sell the company for $200 million, but then withdrew the sale when they could not find prospective buyers at that price.&lt;ref name="bosApr09" /&gt; One reviewer wrote: "The Zagat Survey was once the [[sine qua non]] of restaurant guidebooks. Aside from a review in the paper, the survey's 30-point scale for food, service, and décor—and its quirky comments submitted by readers—was pretty much all that mattered to restaurateurs. While the book's ratings are still highly influential—and while the company remains highly profitable—the guide is no longer the indispensable possession it once was and it's clear that its influence has waned in recent years."&lt;ref name="cityfile" /&gt; The relative decline was attributed to the company's "online strategy" which made the guide only available to paying subscribers.&lt;ref name="cityfile" /&gt; In September 2011, the company was acquired by Google for a reported $151 million.

==Personal life==
The Jewish-American couple have two sons, Ted and John,&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; and live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York.&lt;ref name="nymag0309"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32180">{{For|transformation in [[development economics]]|economic transformation}}

'''Transformation in economics''' refers to a long-term change in dominant economic activity in terms of prevailing relative engagement or employment of able individuals.

Human economic systems undergo a number of deviations and departures from the "normal" state, trend or development. Among them are Disturbance (short-term disruption, temporary disorder), Perturbation (persistent or repeated divergence, predicament, decline or crisis), Deformation (damage, regime change, loss of self-sustainability, distortion), Transformation (long-term change, restructuring, conversion, new “normal”) and Renewal (rebirth, transmutation, corso-ricorso, renaissance, new beginning).

Transformation is a [[Unidirectional network|unidirectional]] and irreversible change in dominant human economic activity ([[Economic sectors|economic sector]]). Such change is driven by slower or faster continuous improvement in sector productivity growth rate. Productivity growth itself is fueled by advances in technology, inflow of useful innovations, accumulated practical knowledge and experience, levels of education, viability of institutions, quality of decision making and organized human effort. Individual sector transformations are the outcomes of human [[socio-economic]] evolution.

Human economic activity has so far undergone at least four fundamental transformations:

#From nomadic hunting and gathering (H/G) to localized agriculture
#From localized agriculture (A) to internationalized industry
#From international industry (I) to global services
#From global services (S) to public sector (including government, welfare and unemployment, GWU)

This evolution naturally proceeds from securing necessary food, through producing useful things, to providing helpful services, both private and public (See H/G→A→I→S→GWU sequence in Fig. 1).  Accelerating productivity growth rates speed up the transformations, from millennia, through centuries, to decades of the recent era. It is this acceleration which makes transformation relevant economic category of today, more fundamental in its impact than any recession, crisis or depression. The evolution of four forms of capital (Indicated in Fig. 1) accompanies all economic transformations.

Transformation is quite different from accompanying cyclical recessions and crises, despite the similarity of manifested phenomena (unemployment, technology shifts, socio-political discontent, bankruptcies, etc.). However, the tools and interventions used to combat crisis are clearly ineffective for coping with non-cyclical transformations. The problem is whether we face a mere crisis or a fundamental transformation (globalization→relocalization).

== Four key forms of capital ==
[[File:Fig1. Nested hypercycles of the transformations through the parallel evolution of four forms of capital.PNG|thumb|Fig. 1. Nested hypercycles of the transformations through the parallel evolution of four forms of capital|287x287px]]

Fig. 1 refers to the four transformations through the parallel (and overlapping) evolution of four forms of capital: Natural→Built→Human→Social. These evolved forms of capital present a minimal complex of sustainability and self-sustainability of pre-human and human systems.

'''[[Natural capital|Natural capital (N)]]'''. The nature-produced, renewed and reproduced “resources” of land, water, air, raw materials, biomass and organisms. Natural capital is subject to both renewable and non-renewable depletion, degradation, cultivation, recycling and reuse.

'''Built capital (B)'''. The man-made physical assets of infrastructures, technologies, buildings and means of transportation. This is the manufactured “hardware” of nations. This national hardware must be continually maintained, renewed and modernized to assure its continued productivity, efficiency and effectiveness.

'''[[Human capital|Human capital (H)]]'''. The continued investment in people’s skills, knowledge, education, health &amp; nutrition, abilities, motivation and effort. This is the “software” and “brainware” of a nation; most important form of capital for developing nations.

'''[[Social capital|Social capital (S)]]'''. The enabling infrastructure of institutions, civic communities, cultural and national cohesion, collective and family values, trust, traditions, respect and the sense of belonging. This is the voluntary, spontaneous “social order” which cannot be engineered, but its self-production (autopoiesis) can be nurtured, supported and cultivated.

== Parallelism of crises and transformations ==
The triggers that induce the catharsis of a crisis often coincide with and are undistinguishable from the triggers launching qualitative transformations of the economy, business and society at large. While crises are cyclical recessions or slowdowns within the same paradigm, transformation represents a paradigmatic change in the way of doing business: moving towards new standards and quality, in a unique and non-recursive way.  Most developed and mature economies of the world (USA, Japan, Western Europe) are undergoing long-term transformation towards a “new normal” of doing business, state governance and ways of life. Cyclical crisis is a parallel, accompanying phenomenon, subject to different causes, special rules and separate dynamics.

[[Milan Zeleny]] cautions that confounding crisis and transformation as one phenomenon brings forth the confusion, inconsistency and guessing.&lt;ref name="Crisis"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/d54282m4176x844n/ | title=Machine/organism dichotomy and free-market economics: Crisis or transformation? | publisher=IOS Press | author=Zeleny, Milan | journal=Human Systems Management |date=November 2010 | volume=29 | issue=4/2010 | pages=P191–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many changes in the market system are cyclical, there are also evolutionary changes which are unidirectional and qualitatively transformational. The transformations of the US economy from agricultural to industrial, or from industrial to services, were not crises, although there were cyclical crises along the way. Transformational “losses” cannot be recovered or regained by definition. Not understanding that is at the core of wasteful spending of rigidly hopeless governmental interventions. Barry Bosworth of the [[Brookings Institution]] confirms:  “The assumption has always been that the U.S. economy will gain back what was lost in a recession. Academics are coming to the realization that this time is different and that those losses appear permanent and cannot be regained.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-06/u-dot-s-dot-potential-gdp-revised-downward-as-recession-damage-lingers | title=The GDP in 2017 Is Not Looking Good | publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek | date=March 2014 | author=Brendan Greeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In transformations there are no “losses”, only changes and transitions to a new economic order.

== Underlying pattern of recessions ==
[[File:Percent Job Losses After WWII Recessions.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2. Comparison of major US recessions over past 30 years|452x452px]]

When comparing major US recessions since 1980, as in Fig. 2, it is clear that they have been getting deeper and longer in terms of the recovery of initial employment level. Only the first is classical V shape, there are several W, U and finally L shapes. There clearly is an underlying causal phenomenon which is getting stronger and more persistent over time. Such underlying causation is of interest, as it may signal the prelude and gathering of forces of another emerging transformation.

Looking back, even [[Great Depression in the United States|the Great Depression]] of the 1930s was not just a crisis, but a long-term transformation from the pre-war industrial economy to the post-war service economy in the U.S. However, in the early 1980s, the service sector had started slowing down its employment absorption and growth potential, ultimately leading to the jobless economy of 2011. No such comparisons with the 1930s are useful: one can compare recessions but not transformations. Industrial economy of 1930s and the post-service economy of 2000s are two different “animals” in two different contexts. It is still not clear what kind of transformation is emerging and eventually replaces the service and public sector economy.

The unrecognized confluence of crisis and transformation, and the inability to separate them, lies at the core of old tools ([[Keynesian economics|keynesianism]], [[monetarism]]) not working properly. The tools for adapting successfully to paradigmatic transformation have not been developed.  An example of a paradigmatic transformation would be the shift from geocentric to heliocentric view of our world.  Within both views there can be any number of crises, cyclical failures of old and searches for new theories and practices. But there was only one transformation, from geocentric to heliocentric, and there was nothing cyclical about it. It was resisted with all the might of the mighty: remember Galilei and Bruno. While crises are cyclical corrections and adjustments, transformations are evolutionary shifts or even revolutions (industrial, computer) towards new and different levels of existence.

The most important indicator is the arena of employment, especially in the US, providing clues to transformational qualities of the current global crisis phenomena. Persistent rates of unemployment, combined with falling workforce participation rate indicate that also this crisis is intertwined with underlying transformation and so it displays atypical dynamics and unusual persistence, presenting new challenges to conventional economic thought, business practices and government interventional “toolbox”. Sector evolution and dynamics is the key to explaining these phenomena.

== Sector dynamics ==
[[Economic sectors]] evolve (in terms of employment levels), albeit through fluctuations, in one general direction (along so called S-curve): they emerge, expand, plateau, contract and exit—just like any self-organizing system or living organism. We are naturally interested in the percentage of total workforce employed in a given sector. The dynamics of this percentage provides clues to where and when are the new jobs generated and old ones abandoned.

Sector’s percentage share of employment evolves in dependency on sector’s productivity growth rate.  Agriculture has emerged and virtually disappeared as a source of net employment. Today, only ½ percent or so of total workforce is employed in US agriculture – the most productive sector of the economy. Manufacturing had emerged, peaked and contracted. Services have emerged and started contracting – all due to incessant, unavoidable and desirable productivity growth rates.

The [[Manufacturing in the United States|U.S. absolute manufacturing output]] has more than tripled over the past 60 years. Because of the productivity growth rates, these goods were produced by ever decreasing number of people. While in 1980-2012 total economic output per hour worked increased 85 percent, in manufacturing output per hour skyrocketed by 189 percent. The number of employees in manufacturing was about a third of total workforce in 1953, about a fifth in 1980, and about a tenth (12 million) in 2012. This decline is now accelerating because of the high-tech automation and robotization. This is why President Obama´s policy of “industrial renaissance” and “high-tech manufacturing jobs” is economically flawed and politically without promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial renaissance in the US: miracle or mirage?|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13352#.UuhCTBAo6M8|publisher=Spiked Magazine|author=Phil Mullan|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A public sector of employment has been emerging: government, welfare and unemployment, based on tax-financed consumption rather than added value production, sheltered from market forces, producing public services. (Observe that the unemployed are temporary “employees” of the government, as long as they receive payments.) Creating employment in GWU sector is achievable at the expense of productive sectors, i.e. only at the risk of major debt accumulation, in a non-lasting way and with low added value. Sustaining employment growth in such a sector is severely limited by the growing debt financing.

== The Four Basic Sectors ==
The Four Basic Sectors refers to the current stage of [[industrial sector|sector]] evolution, in the sequence of four undergone transformations, namely [[agriculture]], [[industry]], [[Service (business)|services]] and GWU ([[government]], [[welfare]] and [[unemployment]])

The US economy has become one of the most mature (with Japan and Western Europe) in terms of its sector evolution.&lt;ref name="M. Zeleny 1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Human Systems Management: Integrating Knowledge, Management &amp; Systems | publisher=World Scientific | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | year=2005 | pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It has entered the stage – perhaps as the first economy ever – of declining employment share in both the service and government sectors.

[[Productivity]] growth rates are now{{when|date=February 2018}} accelerating in the US services and its employment creation and absorption potential are declining rapidly. Accelerating productivity growth rates are dictated by global competition and human striving for better [[standards of living]] – they cannot be stopped at will.  In the US there are only three subsectors where net jobs are still being created: [[education in the US|education]], [[health care in the US|health care]], and government. The first two are subject to market forces and will undergo accelerating productivity growth rates and declining employment levels in the near future{{when|date=February 2018}}. The third one, GWU, is sheltered from competition, cannot expand its share substantially because it depends on taxation from other sectors; its [[employment growth]] is [[unsustainable]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Slowly, the US economy has shifted towards sectors with lower added value, leading to lower real incomes and increasing indebtness. This is a systemic condition which no amount of regulation and [[Keynesian]]/monetarist stimuli can effectively address.  Even desirable piercing of speculative, employment and debt bubbles has ceased to be politically correct. Even 100% taxation of all incomes would not alleviate US debt.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

So, the US is at the transforming cusp and hundreds of years of sector evolution comes to a halt.  There are only four essential activities humans can do economically: 1. [[food production|Produce food]], 2. Manufacture goods, 3. Provide services (private and public), and 4. Do nothing. This is why the idea of “[[basic income]]”, independent of employment, is being considered e.g. in Switzerland.

US economy has exploited (from employment share viewpoint) all three productive sectors. There is no new sector lurking in the offing: qualitative transformation is taking place. Less developed economies still have time left, some still have to industrialize and some still have the services to expand. But the US economy is now the harbinger of the things to come, the role model for others to follow or reject, but hardly ignore. For the first time in history, this one economy has reached the end of the old model (or paradigm) and is groping to find the new ways of organizing its business, economy and society.&lt;ref name="M. Zeleny 2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Human Systems Management: Integrating Knowledge, Management &amp; Systems | publisher=World Scientific | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | year=2005 | pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New transformation ==

[[File:Fig. 3a. Sector dynamics in the US and unsustainability of GWU.PNG|thumb|Fig. 3a. Sector dynamics in the US and unsustainability of GWU.|354x354px]]
[[File:Fig. 4. Decline in employment in all four sectors opens up a new space..PNG|thumb|Fig. 3b. Decline in employment in all four sectors opens up a new space.|264x264px]]

In search of the better name, the [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] Editor argued as follows:

{{quote|"You’d expect a better name to have emerged by now. It took remarkable ingenuity to unleash the forces that paralyzed markets, overturned governments, and ruined countless lives, not to mention causing an historic decline in global gross domestic product. For creativity to fail in the summing up is just one more insult. Of course, it’s hard to name what you can’t comprehend." |Editor´s Letter|[[Businessweek]] , September 12, 2013}}

Meanwhile, New Transformation has already well advanced.

In Fig. 3a, observe that the US economy has matured in terms of its sector evolution. It has entered the stage – as the first economy ever – of declining employment in the service and GWU sectors.

As Fig. 3a documents, the US economy has exhausted (from employment viewpoint) all three productive sectors and has reached for the 17% in GWU. In Fig. 3b we separate the last workforce bar from Fig. 3a, in order to see the impact of productivity growth today.

All four sectors are subject to accelerated productivity growth rates in the near future. The only expanding space of the workforce is the grey region “?” in Fig. 3b, essentially reflecting the decline in workforce participation rate. This grey area is also the space of the new transformation: that’s where those who left unemployment registers are starting new ventures and enterprises, and participating in regional economies.

This new “transformation” is different from all preceding sector transformations: it does not usher in a new sector but completes the secular cycle of localization→globalization→re-localization. A new economic paradigm is emerging, with a new structure, behavior, institutions and values. A more precise label would be Economic Metamorphosis. [[Metamorphosis]] is the outcome of a series of transformations, not dissimilar to a caterpillar-to-butterfly change of form, through the construction→destruction→reconstruction autopoietic self-production cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mystery_of_Metamorphosis.html?id=2G7VWWKRMa4C | title=The Mystery of Metamorphosis: A Scientific Detective Story | publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing | date=April 2011 | last=Ryan | first=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the recession ends, the metamorphosis of economic form shall continue, accelerate and expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shale: the ‘IT bubble’ of the 21st century?|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13363#.UuhZvxAo6M8|publisher=Spiked Magazine|author=Phil Mullan|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Less and less we shall be able to tell the difference. Pressures for increased productivity growth rates, declining employment and workforce participation, as well as budget cuts shall grow unabated. Due to massive automation, sector GDP can grow even under the conditions of declining employment. More than that: increasing the minimum wage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum Wage, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/minimumwage.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; historically rather neutral with respect to employment, will now be readily replacing low-level jobs with ever cheaper and more abundant automation - along with millions of jobs being lost due to the still uninformed and aimless political process. Obscuring the difference between cyclical crisis and the ongoing transformation (metamorphosis) is not without consequences: when true diagnosis is not attempted, and people do not know what is happening with their economy and why, all forms of contagious social unrest follow worldwide.

== Okun's law ==
[[File:Fig. 4. Labor participation.png|thumb|Fig. 4. Labor participation|228x228px]]
In economics, [[Okun's law]] (named after [[Arthur Melvin Okun]]), is an empirically observed relationship relating unemployment to losses in a country's production. This correlation "law" states that a 2% decline in output (GDP) will be accompanied by a 1% rise in unemployment. It has been dubbed as “[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-26/macroeconomic-mystery-u-dot-s-dot-unemployment-subverts-okuns-law Macroeconomic Mystery]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Macroeconomic Mystery | journal=Business Week |date=30 September – 6 October 2013 | pages=P24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After holding for the past 40 years, it faltered during current “recovery”. Unemployment shot up faster than predicted, but then it fell more quickly than indicated by slow U.S. growth in 2009-2013. Output grew 2% but unemployment is 7.6% instead of 8.8% expected by this “law”.

The notion of transformation explains this artificial mystery. First, unemployment shot up faster because there are no major sectors absorbing and replacing the loss of jobs. Second, unemployment also falls faster because, due to the long duration of the crisis, the workforce participation rate keeps shrinking (In 2007, 66% were working or seeking job, in 2013 only 63.2%), as can be seen in Fig. 4. In other words, people leaving the workforce are not counted among the unemployed. For example, in summer 2013, on average only 148,000 new jobs per month were created, yet unemployment rate dropped steeply to 7.3%, at the cost of 312,000 people dropping out of the work force. The number of unemployed (i.e. actively seeking jobs) is different from the number of people without work – another sign of fundamental transformation and not just a “crisis”.

The correlation between growth and employment is very tenuous during ongoing transformation. Based on productivity growth rates, GDP could accelerate and yet jobs drop precipitously, due to automation, robotization, digitization and self-service of the transformation era. Also, correlations in economics are always dangerous because they do not prove or establish causal relationships.

== Self-service, disintermediation and customization ==
The new transformational paradigm could be defined by the ongoing self-organization of the market economy itself: its rates of self-service, [[disintermediation]] and [[mass customization]] are increasing and becoming most effective on local and regional levels. Because there is no new productive sector to emerge, the economy seeks to reinstate its new balance through these new modes of doing business. Producers and providers are outsourcing their production and services to customers and to technology. Outsourcing to customers is a natural and necessary self-organizing process, including disintermediation, customer integration and mass customization, all driven by the global productivity at the cusp of transformation.

Due to its productivity growth rates, each sector must emerge, grow, persist, stagnate, decline and dissipate in terms of its employment generating capacity. The high-productivity growth sectors are emerging and dissipating first, the low-productivity growth sectors (like services) are completing their life cycles only now. Different productivity growth rates in different sectors are accompanied by virtually uniform growth rates in wages and salaries across all sectors, as required by free market forces.

As a consequence, the goods of high productivity growth sectors (food, manufactured goods) are getting cheaper and the products of low productivity growth sectors (health care, education, insurance) are getting more expensive. In many developing nations this may still be the other way around (due to the prevailing stage of sector evolution): food and manufactured goods more expensive, while services still relatively cheap, as captured in the Figure 5:
[[File:Fig. 5. Uniform wage growth vs. differential productivity rates.PNG|thumb|Fig. 5. Uniform wage growth vs. differential productivity rates|372x372px]]

Rational economics agents tend towards substituting relatively cheaper and capital intensive manufactured goods for relatively more expensive and labor-intensive services. Consumers will use goods instead of services wherever economical and possible. By observing the emergence of automated teller machines instead of bank tellers, self-service gas stations instead of full-service stations, self-driving instead of chauffeurs, do-it-yourself pregnancy kits rather than hospital testing services, self-handled optical scanners rather than cashiers, and cloud computing instead of central mainframes, mature economies are entering the era of self-service, disintermediation and mass customization.

Modern production is primarily based on the processing of information, not on the hauling of goods, humans and machinery over large distances.  One can more effectively “haul the information,” to produce goods and provide services locally. Information and knowledge travel effortlessly through electronic superhighways, through telecommunications and social networks over the internet.

== Relocalization ==
{{See also|Localism (politics)}}
Because there is no new productive sector to emerge, the market system seeks to reinstate its new balance through new modes of doing business. [[Deglobalization]] is taking place, supply chains are turning into demand chains, large economies are focusing on their internal markets, outsourcing is followed by “backsourcing”, returning activities back to the countries and locations of their origin. The original slogan of “Think globally, act locally,” is being re-interpreted as exploiting global information and knowledge in local action, under local conditions and contexts.

While [[globalization]] refers to a restructuring of the initially distributed and localized world economy into spatially reorganized processes of production and consumption across national economies and political states on a global scale, in deglobalization, people move towards relocalization: the global experience and knowledge becoming embodied in local communities. So, the corso-ricorso of socio-economic transformation is properly captured by a triad Localization → Globalization → Relocalization.

The trend of [[deglobalization]] is turning much more significant during these years. The growth of worldwide GDP is now exceeding the overall growth of trade for the first time; foreign investment (Cross Border Capital Flows) is only 60% of their pre-crisis levels and has plunged to some 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial globalization: Retreat or reset?|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/global_capital_markets/financial_globalization|publisher=McKinsey Global Institute|date=March 2013|author1=Susan Lund |author2=Toos Daruvala |author3=Richard Dobbs }}&lt;/ref&gt;  World capital flows include loans and deposits, foreign investments, bonds and equities – all down in their cross-border segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6754e5da-76e6-11e3-a253-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2rDTwZEyH | title=Rapid fall in capital flows poses growth risk | publisher=The Financial Times |author1=Ralph Atkins |author2=Keith Fray |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that the rate of globalization has reversed its momentum. Globalizers are still worried about 2014 being the year of irreversible decline. Improvement in the internal growth of U.S.A., EU, and Japan does not carry into external trade – these economies are starting to function as zero-sum.

The income inequality and long-term unemployment lead to re-localized experiments with ''[[Guaranteed Minimum Income]]'' (to be traced to [[Thomas Paine]]) for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Paine|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/tpaine3.html|publisher=Social Security Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/2698139/Two_arguments_for_Basic_Income_Thomas_Paine_1737-1809_and_Thomas_Spence_1750-1814_ | title=Two arguments for Basic Income | last=Marangos | first=John | journal=History of Economic Ideas |date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Switzerland this guarantee would be $33,000 per year, regardless of working or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swiss Join the Fight Against Inequality|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/inequality-fight-swiss-will-vote-on-minimum-income|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|author=Stephan Faris|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the name Generation Basic Income it is now subject to [[Swiss referendums, 2013|Swiss referendum]]. Unemployment then frees people to pursue their own creative talents.

With this transformation, an entirely new vocabulary is emerging in economics: in addition to deglobalization and relocalization, we also encounter glocalization (adjustment of products to local culture) and local community restoration (regional self-government and direct democracy). With relocalization, an entire new cycle of societal corso-ricorso is brought forth. Local services, local production and local agriculture, based on distributed energy generation, additive manufacturing and [[vertical farming]], are enhancing individual, community and regional autonomy through self-service, disintermediation and mass customization. Both requisite technologies and appropriate business models necessary for relocalization are already in place, forming a vital part of our daily business and life experience. New transformation is well on its way.

The [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] first recognized the usefulness of [[United States foreign aid|foreign aid]] as a tool of [[diplomacy]] in [[World War II]]. It was believed that it would promote liberal [[capitalist]] models of development in other countries and that it would enhance national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Foreign Aid |url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/foreign_aid.aspx| accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] is the largest contributor of military aid to foreign countries in the world, providing some form of assistance to over 150 countries each year.

==Military funding programs==
{{citations needed|section|date=March 2016}}
There are three main programs where military funding is allocated:

#[[United States Foreign Military Financing|Foreign military financing]] provides grants for the acquisition of U.S. defense equipment, services, and training. These grants enable friends and allies to improve their defense capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Foreign Military Financing Account Summary|url= https://www.state.gov/t/pm/ppa/sat/c14560.htm |accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of FMF are:
#:* Promoting national security by contributing to regional and global stability
#:* Strengthening military support for democratically elected governments and containing transnational threats, including terrorism and trafficking in narcotics, weapons, and persons
#:* Fostering closer military relationships between the U.S. and recipient nations
#[[Peacekeeping Operations]] (PKO) provide voluntary support for international peacekeeping activities. These funds support non-U.N. operations and training in response to a nation’s crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Foreign Aid: An Introductory Overview of U.S. Programs and Policy |url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/31987.pdf |accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of PKO are:
#:* Promoting increased involvement of regional organizations in conflict resolution
#:* Helping leverage support for multinational efforts in the event of a nation's crisis
#The [[International Military Education and Training]] program (IMET) offers military training on a grant basis to foreign military officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= IMET Assessment Project 2007-2008 |url= http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5586 | accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of IMET are:
#:* Encouraging effective defense relationships
#:* Promoting interoperability with U.S. and coalition forces
#:* Exposing foreign civilian and military officials to democratic values, military professionalism, and international norms of human rights

Some examples of this would include the United States' efforts in Colombia and South Korea. Military aid has been successful in stopping insurgency, providing stability, and ending conflicts within the region.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

In many other cases, military aid has laid the groundwork for other forms of aid. This aid includes building schools to promote education, providing clean drinking water, and further stabilizing food production. Without military aid, this development would have been impossible. {{cn|date=March 2016}}

Some may say that military aid is increasing insurgency in the area, but examples of French and United Nations' efforts show that it has been stopping terrorist forces; especially in Africa.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

==Criticisms==

Currently, Congress wants to cut defense spending by lowering the amount of aid given to foreign militaries.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Foreign Military Aid Needs to Be Cut, Not U.S. Military Spending|url= https://news.yahoo.com/s/ac/20110217/pl_ac/7883190_foreign_military_aid_needs_to_be_cut_not_us_military_spending| accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money saved from proposed cutbacks could benefit the U.S. military, which is closing military bases, freezing pay raises for service members, and cut the defense budget by $78 billion in 2011.&lt;ref name="news.yahoo.com"/&gt;

Particular targets of criticism include
* Funds appropriated to the [[State Department]] and [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] represent the vast majority of unclassified military aid and assistance. The public does not have any way of tracking classified programs administered by the U.S. intelligence community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= A Citizen’s Guide to Understanding U.S. Foreign Military Aid |url= http://projects.publicintegrity.org/militaryaid/default.aspx?act=faq| accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Foreign aid often aids the giver, not the recipient.{{cn|date=January 2015}}
* Corruption is a major problem. Funds often go directly to leaders who may not share the aid with citizens.{{cn|date=January 2015}}
* The United States gives the same amount of money to its top five aid recipients as they give to the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Noah Grant{{Cite book|title= Just the Facts: Foreign Aid vs. Military Spending |url= http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/a-just-foreign-policy/just-the-facts-foreign-aid-vs.-military-spending| accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:University Park at MIT.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The large wire spool in the University Park Common is a reminder of the property's former use as home to the Simplex Wire &amp; Cable Company.]]
'''University Park at MIT''' is a mixed-use [[urban renewal]] project in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], [[United States]], occupying land near [[Central Square (Cambridge)|Central Square]] between the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) campus and the primarily residential neighborhood of [[Cambridgeport]].  It is a joint project of the City of Cambridge, MIT, and [[Forest City Enterprises]].

==History==
The area presently known as University Park was originally an area of mostly marshy land along the [[Charles River]].  During the [[American Revolutionary War]], one area of higher land was the site of a gun battery (now called [[Fort Washington (Massachusetts)|Fort Washington]]) erected to guard against British attack during the [[Siege of Boston]].

In the 1850s, the [[Grand Junction Railroad]] built tracks along what was then the swampy edge of the river.  The nearby marshes were [[land reclamation|landfilled]], and the area became home to a number of manufacturing plants.  These included the Simplex Wire &amp; Cable Company, the [[F. A. Kennedy Steam Bakery|Kennedy Biscuit Company]] (which is the originator of the [[Fig Newton]] and is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]), the [[New England Confectionery Company Factory|Necco]] candy factory, a [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] shoe factory, and a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] assembly plant.

In the 1960s, this part of Cambridge had been threatened by a proposed new highway, [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]], also known as the "Inner Belt" project.  The highway would have been routed along the western boundary of the area that is now University Park, and would have required the demolition of many homes in the adjacent area of [[Cambridgeport]].  Plans for building the highway were eventually dropped because of community opposition.

Simplex, owner of the largest parcel of land, left Cambridge in 1969 (the company later became a unit of [[Tyco International]]).  The Simplex property was then acquired by MIT.  Most of the buildings were razed in the 1970s, leaving a large area of overgrown vacant lots that languished for many years while MIT tried to find a use for the {{convert|27|acre|m2|sing=on}} property.  Serious planning began in 1983 with MIT's selection of Forest City Enterprises to develop the land, and approval of a city master plan for the area.  Construction started in 1985.

For some years afterwards, the site was the subject of protests by community activists who objected to MIT's plans for [[gentrification]] of the neighborhood, and wanted the development to include more affordable housing as well as to preserve the remaining businesses and historic buildings in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.wgbh.org/ton/programs/5513_02.html |title=Community Activists Protest MIT Development |publisher=Main.wgbh.org |date=1988-01-07 |accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final zoning approval for the project was given by the city in January, 1988.

==University Park today==
University Park is a mixed-use development, comprising a combination of office and laboratory buildings that are home to several [[biotechnology]] companies, residential developments, retail areas, and parks and open space.  While MIT continues to own the land, Forest City holds long-term leases.  The last new building on the MIT-owned land was completed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityparkliving.com/news/default.asp?url=1 |title=Urban Land Institute Award |publisher=Universityparkliving.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The project includes 531 rental apartments, more than was originally planned, because demand for housing in Cambridge outstripped that for office space by the time of the project's completion.  Much of the housing is concentrated on the west side of the redevelopment area, bordering the established residential areas in Cambridgeport.  The Kennedy Biscuit building was preserved and converted to loft housing. The former Sears shoe factory building was converted to office space.

Some of the other older buildings in the area adjacent to the MIT-owned property have also been renovated.  The former Necco building now houses a research unit of the pharmaceutical company [[Novartis]].  At the opposite end of the city-designated "revitalization area", the former Ford plant near the [[Boston University Bridge]], originally built in 1913, has also been converted to office space.

As of 2012, plans for further major developments have been announced along Massachusetts Avenue.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Public Art==
The new construction of University Park contains both landscape sculpture sequences and individual public artworks. University Park Common includes over 100 sculptural and graphic pieces as part of ''Traces'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traces Public Art Project|url=http://www.culturenow.org/entry&amp;permalink=13108&amp;seo=Traces-Project-100-Layers_Cambridge-Arts-Council-and-Ross-Miller|publisher=CultureNOW|accessdate= April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an artwork that marks moments in the 250 year history of the site. Commissioned by Forest City Boston, ''Traces'' tells stories of 18th and 19th century commerce and of technical innovations made in the local area. Bronze and stainless steel sculptures present moments in the activity of Simplex Wire and Cable, and a map sequence sculpture documents the changing landform of the site. A [[fog sculpture|fog fountain]] evokes the early [[salt marsh]] history of the site, with cast bronze [[oyster]] shells recalling oyster banks discovered on site during excavation for building foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rossmiller.com/RM/traces_files/Traces%20SiteMap.pdf |title=Map of Traces Artwork |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial bronze sculpture of [[Necco Wafers]] in the signature roll wrapping, with individual round wafers, and printed [[Sweethearts (candy)]] conversation hearts spilling out of a paper bag, is displayed on a boulder in a corner of the park near the former New England Confectionery Company factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.wgbh.org/2018/04/11/how-we-live/necco-mania-fans-stock-chalky-wafers-case-candy-company-folds|title=NPR NECCO factory | publisher=WBUR Boston |date= |accessdate=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:NECCO Memorial Sculpture.jpg|thumb|Memorial sculpture of Necco wafers and conversation hearts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1437">'''Vicente de Azcuénaga Iturbe''' (January 1706–1787) was a [[Spain|Spanish]]-born [[Argentina|Argentine]] businessman and politician.

From [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]], [[Biscay|Vizcaya]], [[Spain]], he arrived in [[Buenos Aires]] in his early forties and was devoted to commercial activities. He proved to be a successful trader which enabled him to amass a small fortune in a short time. He maintained a strong friendship with Francisco Ugarte, another great merchant of the time.

In Argentina Azcuénaga was also treated as a Spanish noble. He was elected [[Mayor of Buenos Aires|Mayor of the Town of Buenos Aires]] in 1759. In 1760, he was appointed ruler of the [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]]. In 1774 he was appointed Trustee of Commerce of San Francisco.

He married María Rosa de Basavilbaso y Urtubia (daughter of Domingo de Basavilbaso) on August 30, 1752. Vincent de Azcuénaga had seven children, three of whom spent time in the Argentine military, while another was an attorney.

'''WRCA''' (1330 [[Hertz|kHz]]) is a commercial [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[radio station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Watertown, Massachusetts]] and serving the [[Greater Boston]] [[media market]].  The license is held by the Beasley Media Group, LLC, part of the [[Beasley Broadcast Group]], Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&amp;appn=101202509&amp;formid=323&amp;fac_num=0 FCC Station Ownership database]&lt;/ref&gt; The station carries financial news from [[Bloomberg Radio]] with some local news, weather and traffic reports. WRCA's programming is also heard on [[Broadcast translator|FM translator]] '''W291CZ''' (106.1&amp;nbsp;MHz) and on the HD2 channel of sister station [[WBOS]].

==History==
[[File:WRCA1330.png|thumb|left|Logo for the station prior to November 15, 2016]]
The station began operating as '''WCRB''' on January 30, 1948, owned by Theodore Jones's [[Charles River Broadcasting]] (hence the W'''CRB''' [[call sign|call letters]]).  WCRB was originally a community radio station for [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], before switching to a [[classical music]] format a few years later.  An FM [[simulcast]] was added in 1954, [[WCRB]]-FM.  As FM broadcasting became more popular for music listening, the AM station ceased simulcasting WCRB-FM's classical format in 1975 and became '''WHET''', programming a [[big band]]/[[adult standards]] format from 1975 until 1978, and then a short run as a [[beautiful music]] outlet.  Sales of the station to various owners led to formats such as [[country music]] '''WDLW''' for most of the 1980s, and then ''"Showbiz Radio"'' '''WRCA''' (standing for "Radio, Comedy, and Arts") in 1990 before the station began [[brokered programming|leasing time]] to ethnic broadcasters in 1991 with the WRCA [[call sign]] retained.  The current owners, the [[Beasley Broadcast Group]], took over in 2000 from the ADD Radio Group.

The station's long time [[transmitter]] site in Waltham was discontinued in 2007 when WRCA became one of three AM stations to share a rebuilt transmitter facility at the original site of [[WUNR|WBOS]] [[AM 1600]] on Sawmill Brook Parkway in [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]].  This site is now used by stations on 1200, 1330 and 1600&amp;nbsp;kHz.

WRCA's [[city of license]] changed from Waltham to Watertown in 2007, and the power increased to 25,000&amp;nbsp;watts daytime, 17,000&amp;nbsp;watts nighttime.  In addition to ethnic programming, WRCA had broadcast [[Northeastern Huskies men's ice hockey]] games.

Following Beasley's acquisition of [[Greater Media]], WRCA went [[dark (broadcasting)|dark]] on November 15, 2016, as it moved to new studios; it returned in May 2017 with a simulcast of "Boston's Irish Channel", the HD2 channel of sister station [[WBQT (FM)|WBQT]], as it was believed that WRCA was in the process of signal testing.  The station was also paired with an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[broadcast relay station|translator]], '''W291CZ''' (licensed to [[Boston]]) at 106.1 [[Hertz|MHz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://radio-locator.com/info/W291CZ-FX Radio-Locator]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2017, [[Bloomberg L.P.]] and Beasley announced that WRCA/W291CZ would begin carrying [[Bloomberg Radio]] programming (which moved over from [[WXKS (AM)|WXKS]]) beginning the following day. Concurrently, the HD2 channel of [[WBOS]] began to simulcast WRCA's programming.&lt;ref&gt;[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/118668/bloomberg-moving-1330106-1-boston/  Bloomberg Radio Moving to 1330/106.1 Boston]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12873">Members of the '''Whitaker family''' and related families were important in the iron and steel business in America during much of the 19th and 20th centuries.

==First Generation==

* '''Joseph Whitaker I''' (1755-1838) was the son of a [[Leeds]] cloth manufacturer; he came to America as a British soldier during the [[American Revolution]] and deserted, settling in Pennsylvania near [[Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site|Hopewell Furnace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pennypacker |first= Samuel Whitaker |authorlink= Samuel W.

==Second Generation==
* '''James Whitaker''' (1782-1875) began producing nails in Philadelphia about 1805, and in 1816 he and his brother Joseph II leased a rolling mill at the Falls of the [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill]], beginning a long series of investments in the iron trade. He was the managing partner at the [[Phoenix Iron Works (Phoenixville, Pennsylvania)|Phoenix Iron Works]] for several years and later was active in family interests at Reading. In 1846 he returned to Philadelphia and mostly retired from iron work, although he remained an investor in several enterprises. He became a [[Society of Friends|Quaker]] late in life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=jwbittner&amp;id=I2432 transcribed bio, supposedly by Samuel Pennypacker]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Joseph Whitaker (industrialist)|Joseph Whitaker II]]''' (1789-1870) was a prominent ironmaster, businessman, and politician.  He was the ironmaster at the [[Phoenix Iron Works (Phoenixville, Pennsylvania)|Phoenix Iron Works]], the [[Principio Furnace]], and owned parts of these businesses and others, along with others of his family.
* '''Francis A. Whitaker''' (1799-1876), brother of Joseph Whitaker II, was also an ironmaster. He operated the Matilda Furnace, [[Mifflin County, Pennsylvania|Mifflin County]], Pennsylvania in 1848-9,&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania State Reports, vol. 18, vol. 6, Philadelphia, 1853, p. 440-448&lt;/ref&gt; and may have operated the Elk Iron Works near Elkton, Maryland. His son William H. Whitaker (1835-1920) was a president and owner of the [[Philadelphia Athletics (American Association)|Philadelphia Athletics]] baseball team of 1882-1890.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', Oct. 5, 1920, obituary "William H. Whitaker"&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''George Price Whitaker''' (1803-1890), brother of Joseph Whitaker II, was his partner in most of his enterprises. He received his early training at an iron works in [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], [[Delaware]] and also saved enough money to receive some formal education in [[Philadelphia]]. He went on to manage a forge near [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], [[Pennsylvania]]. His first investments were in a rolling mill near [[Elkton, Maryland|Elkton]], [[Maryland]] and (with his brother James) a forge in [[North East, Maryland|North East]], Maryland, which he managed for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Cyclopedia of Representative Men of Maryland and Washington, DC'', National Biographical Publishing Company, Baltimore, Maryland, 1879, pp. 661-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836 George and his brother Joseph Whitaker II purchased the Principio Furnace and related properties, which had been in ruins since being burned during the [[War of 1812]], and rebuilt. In 1845 George, Joseph, W. P. C. Whitaker and a partner built an ironworks at [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]], [[Maryland]]. In 1848 George, Joseph, and partners purchased the old Durham Furnace (once run by [[George Taylor (delegate)|George Taylor]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]) in [[Durham Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Durham Township]], Pennsylvania and revived that. In 1855 George and Joseph purchased an interest in the Crescent Iron Works in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] in what was then Virginia. At the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] George and Joseph divided their properties, George receiving the Maryland and Virginia share, Joseph the Pennsylvania holdings. In 1863 George purchased the Crescent ironworks outright and ran it until 1868, when it was bought by others. George repurchased the works after the owners went bankrupt and created the "Whitaker Iron Company", with George as president and his son [[Nelson E. Whitaker]] as secretary. George P. Whitaker served one term in the Maryland legislature, in 1867, and also represented Maryland on the board of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]].

==Third Generation==
* '''William P. C. Whitaker''' (1812-1888), eldest son of Joseph Whitaker II, helped run the family furnaces at Principio and erected new ones at Havre de Grace, Maryland. 
* '''Joseph Coudon''' (III) (1823-1880), a member of a wealthy Maryland family (owner of the estate [[Woodlands (Perryville, Maryland)|Woodlands]]), married Caroline Whitaker (1833-1898), daughter of George Price Whitaker, in 1854. He became a partner in Whitaker &amp; Coudon, which sold iron products from the family furnaces and elsewhere in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of a Pennsylvanian, Samuel Whitaker Pennypacker, Philadelphia, 1918, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Joseph Rusling Whitaker''' (1824-1895), son of Joseph Whitaker II, helped his brother William erect ironworks at Havre de Grace, Maryland in 1845 and became for ten years the family's manager at the Durham Iron Works after his father and uncle purchased it in 1848. He was later president of the Swede Iron Company and made lucrative investments in street railways in Philadelphia. In 1878 he moved to Delaware and was a delegate to the national Republican convention of 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rusling Whitaker 1824-1895 and His Progenitors, Samuel Whitaker Pennypacker, Philadelphia, 1895, p. 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''George W. Whitaker''' (1826-1891), son of Joseph Whitaker II, served as president of the Saucon Iron Company in [[Hellertown, Pennsylvania|Hellertown]], Pennsylvania, in which he and his brother Joseph R. Whitaker had shares.&lt;ref&gt;''Statistics of the American and Foreign Iron Trades for 1891'', American Iron and Steel Association, Philadelphia, 1892, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nelson E. Whitaker|Nelson Evans Whitaker]] (1839-1909) was the son of George Price Whitaker and inherited a share of his iron and steel interests in West Virginia and Maryland. He ran the businesses successfully and became a politician in West Virginia as well, serving as president of the state senate 1897-9.
* '''Edmund Simmons Whitaker''' (1838-1898) was another son of George Price Whitaker. He managed the Durham Iron Works in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and the Principio Furnace for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.org/md/cecil/bios/whitaker-es.txt bio of E. S. Whitaker]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fourth Generation==
* '''[[Samuel Whitaker Pennypacker]]''' (1843-1916) was a grandson of Joseph Whitaker II; he was a judge, historian, and governor of Pennsylvania. As a young man he worked at the firm of Whitaker &amp; Coudon, iron merchants, in Philadelphia, which sold iron from the family ironworks and other furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of a Pennsylvanian, Samuel Whitaker Pennypacker, Philadelphia, 1918, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Joseph Coudon (IV)''' (1858-1940), grandson of George Price Whitaker, was one of the executors of George Price Whitaker's will, and helped to defend the actions of the executors from legal challenges by some of the other members of the family.&lt;ref&gt;''Atlantic Reporter'', volume 100, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; He had large land holdings in [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]], Maryland, was the president of several banks there, and was a director of the Wheeling Steel Company at his death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Midland Journal'', February 23, 1940, "Joseph Coudon Passes Away"&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Alexander Glass''' (1858-1941) was a son-in-law of Nelson E. Whitaker. After working for both the LaBelle Iron Works in [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]], [[Ohio]] (which his father Andrew Glass had helped found) and Whitaker family steel plants, he started the Wheeling Corrugating Company, with the help of an investment from his father-in-law.  It was the first firm in Wheeling to make zinc-coated steel, corrugated for strength, for building, and it was a success. In 1919 Glass' company, the La Belle Iron Works, the Whitaker-Glessner Company, and the Wheeling Steel and Iron Company combined to form the Wheeling Steel Corporation, which Glass later led until his death in 1941. Wheeling Steel merged with Pittsburgh Steel to form [[Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wheeling.weirton.lib.wv.us/history/people/hallfame/1980glas.htm Wheeling Hall of Fame entry for Alexander Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; Glass incidentally made Wheeling, West Virginia famous by placing a large red "Wheeling" label on the company's garbage pails, which were widely used.
* '''Albert C. Whitaker''' (1867-1951) was a son of Nelson E. Whitaker; he served as president of the Whitaker Iron Company, the Wheeling Corrugating Company, and the Riverside Bridge Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindapages.com/wags-ohio/progwv-159.jpg bio of Albert C. Whitaker]&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from business in 1921.
* '''Nelson Price Whitaker''' (1873-1922) was a grandson of George Price Whitaker (through his son Cecil, who predeceased him). He helped manage the family businesses, serving in 1910 as the general manager of the Whitaker-Glessner Company, Wheeling Corrugating Company, and the Portsmouth Steel Company.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial World, Vol. 44, issue 1&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1916, and was chairman of the state Highway Commission until shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Alumni News, August 1922, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dwight Homans Wagner''' (1874-1958) married Eliza "Elsie" Whitaker (1874-1931), daughter of Nelson E. Whitaker. Trained as an architect at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], Wagner was put to work running the family enterprises, serving as an officer in various Whitaker companies and running his own business manufacturing concrete blocks, bridge piers, and other forms. He eventually served as president of Alexander Glass' Wheeling Corrugating Company, by then a subsidiary of the Whitaker-Glessner Company.&lt;ref&gt;''The Iron Age'', Feb. 10, 1916, p. 384, "Whitaker-Glessner Company's Year" (Wagner a director of the Whitaker-Glessner Company)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvgenweb.org/ohio/wvirginians-7.jpg Wagner bio with picture at wvgenweb]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fifth Generation==
* '''Andrew Glass''' (1881-1925) was a nephew of Alexander Glass. He started as a salesman for his uncle's Wheeling Corrugating Company, managed the [[Portsmouth, Ohio|Portsmouth]], [[Ohio]] ironworks of the Whitaker-Glessner Company, and later served as president of the Whitaker-Glessner Company and vice-president of the Wheeling Steel Company (after their consolidation). He died of an illness at the age of 44.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.net/wv/ohio/bios/g4200001.txt History of West Virginia, Old and New, Vol. 2, American Historical Society, 1923, p. 68-9]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''George Parks Whitaker''' (1891-1948) was the son of Albert C. Whitaker. A [[Princeton University]] graduate, he helped run some of the Whitaker family enterprises, serving as secretary/treasurer of the Whitaker Iron Company, assistant treasurer of the Whitaker-Glessner Company, and assistant treasurer of the Wheeling Corrugating Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.net/wv/ohio/bios/w3260001.txt bio of G. P. Whitaker]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sixth Generation==
* '''George Parks Whitaker Jr.''' (1922-2003) was the son of George Parks Whitaker. He served in the Army Air Force (Air Medal, Distinguished Flying Cross) during World War II, graduated from [[Kenyon College]], and traveled around Europe, meeting his future wife Anita Malmstrom while working at the Sandvik Steel Works in Sweden. He returned to Wheeling to join the Wheeling Steel company and retired after 25 years as the General Manager of the Ohio Valley Division of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel. He then became president of the Wheeling Stamping Company, a manufacturer of tubes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kepnerfuneral.com/obituaries/obituaries/george-parks-whitaker-jr obituary of George Parks Whitaker Jr.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoo was the chairman of [[Chonghaejin Marine]], which operated the [[MV Sewol]] ferry en route from Incheon towards Jeju when it sank.

In June, a male body was found in a field and on 21 July it was reported that it was Yoo's.&lt;ref name="usatodayjul"&gt;{{cite news |last=Winter|first=Michael|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/07/21/korea-ferry-disaster-owner-dead/12968665/|title=Body believed fugitive owner of sunken ferry|work=USA Today|date=21 July 2014|accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ahae ===
Ahae ({{Lang|ko|아해}}), which means "child" in old Korean language, was a nickname used in reference to Yoo in correspondence on an Evangelical Baptist Church website EBC World ({{URL|www.ebcworld.org}}). Through his PR companies Ahae Press, Inc. in New York, Ahae Press France in Paris, and Ahae Press Ltd. UK in London, Yoo has exhibited and marketed himself as the photographer who goes by the name Ahae.&lt;ref name=ahaepressrelease20140425 /&gt;&lt;ref name=moneytoday220414/&gt; Yoo was unknown as a photographer before 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Garreth |url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Artist-linked-to-Korean-ferry-disaster-/32722 |title=Artist linked to Korean ferry disaster |work=[[The Art Newspaper]] |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=고미석 |url=http://news.donga.com/Main/3/all/20140424/63001699/1 |title="사진작가 아해? 처음 듣는 인물" : 뉴스 : 동아닷컴 |work=[[The Dong-a Ilbo]] |date=24 April 2014 |accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=김지훈 |url=http://news.mt.co.kr/mtview.php?no=2014052114374837454 |script-title=ko:유병언 사진전 개최한 파리의 아해프레스 가봤더니... |work=Money Today |publisher=News.mt.co.kr |language=Korean |date=23 May 2014 |accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="exponaute1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Magali |last=Lesauvage |url=http://www.exponaute.com/magazine/2014/06/10/mecene-artiste-gourou-ennemi-public-limprobable-affaire-ahae/ |title=Mécène-artiste, gourou, ennemi public : l'improbable affaire Ahae |trans-title=Patron-artist, guru, public enemy: the improbable Ahae case |language=French |publisher=Exponaute.com |date=10 June 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project titled ''Through My Window'' began in early spring 2009 and continued for 4 years, during which time Yoo allegedly took about 2.7 million photographs, all through one window, which equates to a rate of roughly one photo every 60 seconds. The collection mainly consists of natural scenes shot through the window of Yoo's own studio. The location is the rural [[commune]] belonging to the Evangelical Baptist Church called "Geumsuwon" ({{Lang|ko|금수원}}) east of [[Anseong]] south of Seoul, where Yoo lives.&lt;ref name="knížák295"&gt;{{cite book |last=Knížák |first=Milan |date=2012 |title=Book on Ahae |url=http://www.kant-books.cz/en/books/book-on-ahae-so-simple-so-beautiful-so-perfect/ |location= |publisher=KANT&amp;nbsp;– Karel Kerlicky |page=295 |isbn=978-80-7437-077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=speculationabout&gt;{{cite news |last=Kim |first=Connie |url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/news/News_View.asp?nseq=162546 |title=Speculation about Sewol-ho ferry owner's whereabouts rises again |publisher=[[Arirang (TV network)|Arirang News]] |date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leadership ===
Michael Ham, managing director of Ahae Press and co-director of Evangelical Media Group, in a press release 25 April 2014 said: "Mr. Yoo does not have any involvement in the management or day-to-day operations of Chonghaejin Marine Co. ...

Investigators have obtained evidence indicating Yoo as the ''de facto'' leader of the company. One piece of evidence is a detailed list of all the company's staff prepared on 15 April 2014, a day before the sinking of the MV ''Sewol'', which named Yoo as chairman of Chonghaejin Marine with employee number A99001, or employee No. 1 at the company, which was established in 1999.&lt;ref name="ferryownership"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2014/05/09/2014050901411.html |title=Investigators Confirm Ownership of Ferry Operator |work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]] |date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also discovered a pay stub that records a payment of {{SK won|15|link=no}} million (~{{US$|14,700}}) monthly over more than a year.&lt;ref name=yoomayfacehomicide&gt;{{cite news |last=Kim |first=Da-ye |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2014/05/116_156891.html |title=Yoo may face homicide charges |work=The Korea Times |date=12 May 2014 |accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yoodirected"&gt;{{cite news |last=Jeong |first=Hyo-sik |title=Yoo directed Sewol remodeling, testimony says |work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]] |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2989414 |accessdate=21 May 2014 |date=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also obtained testimony from others that Yoo was directly involved in managing the ferry operator.&lt;ref name="ferryownership"/&gt;

''Sewol'' was remodeled between October 2012 and February 2013 to increase the number of passenger [[Cabin (ship)|cabin]]s and add a fifth floor, mainly used as an [[exhibition hall]] for photographs by Yoo (Ahae). The employee of Chonghaejin who was in charge of the [[refit]]ting testified that he carried out the expansion under the direction of Yoo.&lt;ref name="yoodirected"/&gt;

Investigators found that Yoo has glossed over critical problems with the stability of the refurbished vessel. According to the prosecution, the regular captain of the ''Sewol'' testified that he had warned Chonghaejin Marine of serious stability problems with the vessel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/captain-says-warnings/1090142.html |title=Captain says warnings over Korean ferry ignored |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |date=30 April 2014 |accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kim Han-shik, the chief of Chonghaejin Marine notified Yoo of the risks of overloading it with freight in January 2014.

Based on the [[Direct evidence|evidence]], prosecutors concluded that Yoo was the one who directs operation and execution of business, and planned to hold Yoo [[vicariously liable]] for the acts of the operator's crew members.
