      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1396">'''Adidam Mummery Sacred Theatre''' is a contemporary sacred use of the [[Mummers play|mummery]] theatre concept that has arisen within a small [[New Religious Movement]] named Adidam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adidam.org/ Adidam]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The founder and Spiritual Teacher of Adidam, named [[Adi Da]], wrote what is now called ''The Mummery Book'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mummerybook.org/ The Mummery Book] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206012909/http://www.mummerybook.org/ |date=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which  he  first  began writing in 1957) expanded over many years  into what he calls a  “Liturgical Theatre”.  It is performed at the Adidam [[Ashram]] (or Retreat Sanctuary) named “The Mountain of Attention”, located in Clear Lakes Highland in [[Northern California]], at least once annually  and often several times a year.  It uses artistically talented formal members of Adidam with some professional help.  

The central theme, meaning and script content of ''The Mummery Book'' and its theatrical impact appear to be related (most closely) to this definition of mummery:  "a ridiculous, hypocritical, or pretentious ceremony or performance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/mummery mummery - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aiy''' ([[Sakha language|Sakha]]: ''Айыы'', [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Айыы'') are benevolent spirits in [[Yakuts]] [[mythology]]. They are creators of the world and of the fabulous land of the Yakut Olonkhos. In Sakha belief, creator of the world "Urung Ai Toyon", is the greatest of them.&lt;ref&gt;Türk Mitolojisi Ansiklopedik Sözlük, Celal Beydili, Yurt Yayınevi {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to mythology, the Aiy live in the Upper World. It is believed that the Aiy will not accept blood [[sacrifice]] and therefore they are presented "victims" of [[vegetable]] and [[dairy product]]s.

Aiy symbols are required for the ''Ysyakh'' (spring feast) and regulated by the government of the [[Sakha Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;ПРАВИТЕЛЬСТВО РЕСПУБЛИКИ САХА (ЯКУТИЯ).

'''{{IAST|Añjanā}}''' ('''Anchanai''', '''Anjani''', '''Anjati''', '''Anjaneya''' or '''Swaha''') is the mother of Lord [[Hanuman]], one of the heroes of the Indian epic, the ''[[Ramayana]]''.

According to a version of the legend, {{IAST|Añjanā}} was an [[apsara]] named ''Puñjikastalā'', who was born on earth as a [[vanara]] princess and married [[Kesari (Ramayana)|Kesari]], a [[vanara]] chief. [[Vayu]], god of the wind, carried the divine power of [[Lord Shiva]] to Anjana's womb, and thus Hanuman was born as an incarnation of Lord Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Pollet | first =Gilbert | title =Indian Epic Values: Ramayana and Its Impact: Proceedings of the 8th International Ramayana Conference, Leuven, 6–8 July 1991 (Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta) | publisher =Peeters | date =January 1995 | isbn =978-90-6831-701-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 68|editor=K.S.

In [[Himachal Pradesh]], Goddess Anjana is worshiped as a family deity. There is a temple dedicated to her at 'Masrer' near [[Dharamshala]]. It is believed that Sri Anjana once came and remained there for some time. One of the locals upon learning, revealed her real identity to the other villagers, going against her wishes. She soon left, but not before turning that villager into stone which remains outside her temple even to this day. Her [[vahana]] (vehicle) is a scorpion, hence believers worship Anjana after being bitten by a scorpion.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

There is a cave of Anjana Devi near Hunasigi (Talikota) not very far from Hampi (Kishkinda) where it is belived Hanuman was born.

==Popular culture==
Anjana is portrayed in several films and [[TV serials]],

The '''Bhar''' are a [[Caste system in India|caste]] in India, sometimes referred to as a subcaste of boatmen.{{sfnp|Shah|2013|ps=}}

==History and origin==
''Bhar'' is a word derived from tribal languages, which means ''warrior''. The tribal society of central India used to have its own hierarchy, with clans ranging from priestly class, warriors to service or menial class. The tribal society had special respect for its warriors and martial clans. Bhar is one such clan, which in the medieval period had its own small principalities in various parts of North India. The Bhar formed small kingdoms in the Eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] region, until they were disposed by invading [[Rajput]] and Muslim groups in the later Middle Ages. The last Bhar raja was killed by [[Ibrahim Shah Sharqi]], the [[Sultanate of Jaunpur|Sultan of Jaunpur]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Influenced by the [[Arya Samaj]] movement, as were members of other lowly castes, Baijnath Prasad Adhyapak published ''Rajbhar Jati ka Itihas'' in 1940. This book attempted to prove that the Rajbhar were formerly rulers who were related to the ancient Bhar tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fascinating Hindutva: Saffron Politics and Dalit Mobilisation |first=Badri |last=Narayan |year=209 |publisher=SAGE Publications |page=25 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8bJ_rhfu6yUC&amp;pg=PA25 |isbn=978-8-17829-906-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present==
The Bhar are primarily a community of small cultivators who supplement their income by wage labour. Landholdings are small, and many Bhar work on fields owned land.{{clarify|reason=makes no sense - does this mean many are agricultural labourers?|date=August 2017}} The Bhar are a Hindu community, and have customs similar to other Hindu communities of the [[Awadh]] region. They speak [[Awadhi]] and [[Bhojpuri]]. The community are found in the districts of [[Azamgarh]], [[Jaunpur district|Jaunpur]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Gonda district|Gonda]], [[Gorakhpur]], [[Mau]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ambedkar Nagar]] and [[Faizabad]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Communities that are related to the Bhar by occupation in [[Uttar Pradesh]] include the Batham, Bind, Dhimar, Dhinwar, Dhewar, Gariya, Gaur, Godia, Gond, Guria, Jhimar, Jhir, Jhinwar, Jhiwar, Kahar, Kashyap, Keot, Kewat, Kharwar, Khairwar, Kumhar, Machua, Majhi, Majhwar, Mallah, Nishad, Prajapati, Rajbhar, Riakwar, Tura,  Turah, Turaha, Tureha and Turaiha. There were proposals in 2013 that some or all of these communities in the state should be reclassified as [[Scheduled Castes]] under India's [[Reservation in India|system of positive discrimination]]; this would have involved declassifying them from the [[Other Backwards Class]] (OBC) category.{{sfnp|Shah|2013|ps=}} Whether or not this would happen was a significant issue in the campaign for the [[2014 Indian general election]].{{sfnp|Srivastava|2014|ps=}}

They are among 17 OBC communities that were again proposed for Scheduled Caste status by the [[Samajwadi Party]]-controlled [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]]. However, this proposal, which relates to [[votebank politics]], has been stayed by the courts; the prior attempt had been rejected by the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Setback for Akhilesh government as High Court stays their order to include 17 sub-castes in the SC category |date=24 January 2017 |work=Financial Express |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/elections/uttar-pradesh-assembly-elections-2017/setback-for-akhilesh-government-as-high-court-stays-their-order-to-include-17-sub-castes-in-the-sc-category/520325/ |accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UP govt to include 17 other backward castes in SC list |date=22 December 2016 |agency=PTI |work=Hindustan Times |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-to-include-17-other-backward-castes-in-sc-list/story-jQWfybFAcSJTnwj2k4NxqO.html |accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buddhism in Iran''' dates back to the [[2nd century]], when [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], such as [[An Shigao]], were active in spreading [[Buddhism in China]]. Many of the earliest translators of Buddhist literature into Chinese were from [[Parthia]] and other kingdoms linked with present-day [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Handbuch der Orientalistik: Sarvāstivāda Buddhist Scholasticism|publisher=Brill|first=Charles|last=Willemen|first2=Bart|last2=Dessein|first3=Collett|last3=Cox|first4=Jan|last4=Gonda|first5=Johannes|last5=Bronkhorst|authorlink5=Johannes Bronkhorst |first6=Bertold|last6=Spuler|first7=Hartwig|last7=Altenmüller|pages=128–130|isbn=978-90-04-10231-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-Islamic Iran===
Buddhists were persecuted during the [[Sasanid]] rule in the vast territory they ruled, as they made [[Zoroastrianism]] the state religion in 224 AD, and thereafter burned many Buddhist sites in the regions where it was practised, namely [[Central Asia]]. Surviving Buddhist sites in the easternmost Sassanian territories comprising modern day Central Asia were later raided in the 5th century by the [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]].&lt;ref name="Yarshater1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Ehsan Yarshater]]|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7IHmyKcPtYC&amp;pg=PA956|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-24693-4|pages=956–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab conquests and decline===
At the time of the [[Arab conquests]] in the mid-7th century, much of the eastern Iranian world was mainly Buddhist. [[Afghanistan]] is rich in Buddhist sites; others have been found in [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and within Iran itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], "Buddhism in the Iranian World," ''The Muslim World'' 100/2-3, 2010, pp. 204-214&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab conquests brought the final demise of Buddhism in Eastern Iran and Afghanistan, although in some sites like [[Bamiyan]] and [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]] it survived until the 8th or 9th century.&lt;ref name="Yarshater1993"/&gt;

[[Mongol]] ruler [[Ghazan]], who received Buddhist education in his youth, converted to [[Islam]] in 1295 AD and made it the state religion of the [[Ilkhanate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  Dunn | first = Ross E. | title = The adventures of Ibn Battuta, a Muslim traveler of the fourteenth century | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2005 | location = | pages = 86, 161 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Js8qHFVw2gEC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;q= | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-520-24385-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also prohibited the practice of Buddhism, but allowed monks to go into exile into neighboring Buddhist regions.&lt;ref name="AkasoyBurnett2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anna Akasoy|author2=Charles Burnett|author3=Ronit Yoeli-Tlalim|title=Islam and Tibet: Interactions Along the Musk Routes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZfWXIfbynwYC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6956-2|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
In recent years, as part of the post-revolution period, Buddhist ideas and practice, as part of a broader reemergence of various faiths in [[Iran]], has experienced an upsurge of interest among [[Iranian people|Iranians]]. Some of the poetry of [[Sohrab Sepehri]] shows Buddhist influence.&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, pp. 212-213&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5220">'''Chullakalinga''' (Odia: '''ଚୁଳକଳିଙ୍ଗ''') was an ancient prince of Kalinga (Odisha) who has been mentioned clearly in the Chullakalinga [[Jataka tales|Jataka]] and Kalingabodhi Jataka [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] records. Both the Jatakas mention the tale of Chullakalinga in the light that the events happened in the lifetime of a [[Bodhisattva|Bodhisttva]] who might have been visited by [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself later in the period of Kalinga II who was also Chullakalinga's descendant. Chullakalinga existed before the birth of Buddha and his timeline could be cautiously placed around the 6th century B.C.E but this since the records about him are obtained from the narrations of Buddha himself, it is difficult to place the exact date which could vary immensely to the time before Buddha's era.

== Chullakalinga's Birth and Abdication of Throne &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j4/j4043.htm|title=The Jataka, Vol. IV, tr. by W.H.D. Rouse, [1901], at sacred-texts.com|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sacred-texts.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orissalinks.com/odia/classical3.pdf|title=Classical Odia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
Chullakalinga and his elder brother Mahakalinga were born to Kalinga I, the king of Kalinga who might have been a vassal of [[Dandaka]]rnya forest kingdom known as Dandaka whose ruler was known as Dandaki. The Jatakas speak of the fall and partition of Dandaka into [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]], [[Assaka]] and [[Vidarbha]] kingdoms which were opponents to each other. On the birth of Chullakalinga, fortune tellers prophesied that his elder brother Mahakalinga would become a [[Chakravartin|Chakravatii]] and he would become an ascetic. Being aware of this prophecy, Chullakalinga became jealous, arrogant and notorious.  On becoming the king, Mahakalinga ordered the arrest of Chullakalinga due to his improper behavior. After being informed by a courtier (Kalinga Bahardvaja), Chullakalinga escaped arrest and ran away in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] forest kingdom of [[Himavat]] and lived in the disguise of an ascetic.  Before leaving he had showed a ring with a seal, coverlet and sword to the courtier as a token so that he could identify later his son when he returns to claim the throne one day.

== The Runaway Royal Family from Sagala and Marriage of Chullakalinga&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/jatakatalesfranc00fran|title=Jataka Tales 1916|last=|first=|publisher=Gyan Books Pvt. Ltd. (Delhi, India)|year=1916|isbn=9333377263|location=Delhi|pages=343–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The King and Queen of the kingdom of Madda ([[Madra]]) had run away from their city of [[Sagala]] with their daughter. According to the Jatakas, the fortune tellers had predicted that the their daughter would give birth to a Chakravartii in future and this prophecy led to a situation when every possible king or prince wanting to produce a powerful heir to their throne in future approached the king for his daughter's hand in marriage. Due to this unfavorable disturbance and interference by multiple powerful kings, the king and queen of Madda ran into the forest for the safety of their daughter.

While taking bath in the river [[Ganges|Ganga]] one day, Chullakalinga encountered the princess in the forest singing and collecting flowers. One of the flowers got stuck in the hair of Chullakalinga and being attracted to her, he followed the princess to her parents. After taking the approval from the convinced King and the Queen, Chullakalinga married the princess. A son with auspicious signs of good luck and virtue was born to both of them who was named as Kalinga (later to be known as Kalinga II).

== Crowning of Chullakalinga's son Kalinga II &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/ka/kaalingabodhi_jat_479.htm|title=Kālingabodhi Jātaka|last=|first=|date=|website=www.what-buddha-said.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
[[Kalinga II]] grew up by learning all the necessary arts of a future king from his father and maternal grandfather. On the death of Mahakalinga in [[Dantapura]], Chullakalinga asked his son to go to the kingdom and claim their ancestral throne. Kalinga II carried the three tokens of his father and met up with Kalinga Bhardvaja who helped him to be crowned as the king. Kalinga Bharadvaja taught the king ten rituals which a universal monarch or Chakravartii had to perform.

== Conclusion ==
Chullakalinga's tale along with that of his son Kalinga II was narrated by Buddha himself as stated in the Jatakas. One of the Jatakas itself is named after him as "Chullakalinga Jataka". Chullakalinga never managed to become a king due to threat from his elder brother and his own unruly behavior as a youth, although he did show the way to his son Kalinga II to become a powerful monarch in the state of Kalinga in the ancient times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8654">[[File:Venus symbol.svg|right|thumb|Gleb Botkin used this symbol of [[Venus (mythology)|Aphrodite]] on the [[vestment]]s for his Church of Aphrodite.]]
'''The Church of Aphrodite''' is a [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] religious group founded in 1938 by [[Gleb Botkin]] (1900–1969), a Russian émigré to the United States. [[Monotheism|Monotheistic]] in structure, the Church believes in a singular female Goddess, who is named after the ancient Greek goddess of love, [[Aphrodite]].

Having grown up in the Russian Imperial court, Botkin fought in the [[Russian civil war]] on the side of the counter-revolutionary forces after his father, a physician to the royal [[Romanov]] monarchy, was executed by the [[Bolshevik Party|Bolshevik government]]. Fleeing to [[Long Island]] in the [[United States]], he began writing novels and non-fiction books, mostly set in his Russian homeland, before coming to believe in a female divinity and founding the Church of Aphrodite. He won the right to register it as a religious charter in the [[New York State Supreme Court]].

==Beliefs and practices==

The only known printed source concerning the doctrine of the Church of Aphrodite is the treatise ''In Search of Reality'' written and published by Gleb Botkin in the 1960s''.'' The treatise opens with the opinion that "prevalent religious beliefs and standards of morality . . . are based chiefly on . . . fantasies . . . of primitive people of an ancient past”, and he “to develop morally and intellectually, as well as enable us to lead happier lives.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Search of Reality|last=Botkin|first=Gleb|publisher=The Church of Aphrodite|year=|isbn=|location=Charlottesville, Va.|pages=13; 15 - 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central concept in Botkin's metaphysics is [[Love]], which he defines not as an emotion but "energy", which engenders all [[being]]. The only “inexhaustible Generator of Love—its Prime Source and Ultimate Object—is the Supreme Deity and [[Creator deity|Creator]].” According to Botkin, the Deity is Creator by the very reason it radiates love, which creates the cosmos. The process of this emanation is “an organic one,” and therefore “the cosmos must be regarded as a fruit of the Divine Organism—not an arbitrarily created artifact.” This is why the Supreme Deity should be visualized “not as a Father God, but the Mother Goddess,” since “it is only the feminine organism which is capable of bearing fruit.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since Botkin considered love an eternal flow, he based the hopes for the immortality of human beings with the fact that they were consciously capable of love towards each other and the Deity. "The Beyond" or "Paradise" is a place where [[evil]] - the antithesis of Love and its concomitants [[Beauty]] and Harmony - is absent. 

The  relationship between the Goddess Aphrodite and the visible world may be illustrated by that between a mother and her child. Having given birth to a child organically, a mother proceeds to take care of it with both her body and her mind. So the Goddess in Her relation with our world is both the Universal Cause and the Universal Mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bot67|Botkin 1967]]. p.&lt;/ref&gt;

As it espouses a monotheistic, syncretic faith, its beliefs were not consistent with the modern reconstructionist Hellenic religion of [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]] but closer to that of [[Dianic Wicca|[Dianic] Wicca]].

As Neopagan scholar [[Chas S. Clifton]] noted, "Botkin's own writings anticipated by a generation the sort of Goddess religion found later in the pages of Green Egg and elsewhere," and which were propagated by Neopagan groups such as Dianic Wicca in the 1960s onward during the [[Second Wave Feminism|Second Wave feminist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Gleb Botkin and the Church's founding ===
[[Gleb Botkin]] was born in 1900, the son of [[Eugene Botkin]], who was the physician to the [[Romanovs]], the Russian royal family of the time, and as such Gleb grew up in a wealthy background within the imperial household. Following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] of 1917, when the [[Bolshevik Party]], a group of [[Marxism|Marxists]] who wished to implement [[socialism|socialist]] reforms, took power, the monarchy was entirely abolished. A subsequent [[Russian civil war|civil war]] broke out between those forces that supported the revolutionary government, the "Reds", and those that opposed them, the "Whites." The Bolsheviks subsequently ordered the execution of the Romanovs, fearing that the Whites would reinstate them, and so, in July 1918, the family, along with several of their closest aides, including Evgeny Botkin, were shot dead in the basement of the Ipatiev house in [[Ekaterinburg]]. His son, Gleb Botkin, retreated eastwards with the Whites, but following their defeat, fled via [[Japan]] to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently gaining employment as a commercial illustrator, Botkin began writing a series of books, both fiction and non-fiction, including an account of his memories of the Romanovs entitled ''The Real Romanovs, as Revealed by the Late Czar's Physician and His Son'' (1931).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bot31|Botkin 1931]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his fictional stories also drew from his experience and involvement with the Russian aristocracy: ''Her Wanton Majesty'' (1934) was a fictionalised biography of [[Catherine I]], the wife of Tsar [[Peter the Great]], which portrayed her as a particularly lustful figure,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bot34|Botkin 1934]].&lt;/ref&gt; whilst ''Immortal Woman'' (1933) dealt with the story of fictional Russian composer Nikolai Dirin, who after being persecuted by the Bolsheviks flees to the United States where he settles in [[Long Island]], the very place that Botkin himself had settled into.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bot33|Botkin 1933]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Immortal Woman'' shows that Botkin was beginning to have ideas about a monotheistic goddess, for instance containing a quote in which the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] priest Father Aristarch states that "the Supreme Deity must be a woman" whilst at another point Dirin enters a church and began "to pray fervently to Aphrodite - his beautiful and kind Goddess whom the Christian Church decried as the White She-Devil, whose worshipers the heads of the Christian Church have repeatedly anathematized."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bot33|Botkin 1933]]. p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===

Botkin later  moved the church to [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. He self-published a book arguing that [[Aphrodite]] was the supreme deity and the creation of the world was like a woman giving birth. The church was one of the earliest of its kind in the [[neopaganism]] movement in the United States. Botkin's church is mentioned in ''Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America,'' by Chas S. Clifton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=  | year=| title="Gleb Botkin in Charlottesville, Virginia," a thread at Alexanderpalace.org | work= alexanderpalace.org | url=http://forum.alexanderpalace.org/index.php/topic,3126.0.html| accessdate= February 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=  | year=| title="Donald D.

'''Citizens for Public Justice''' (CPJ) is an ecumenical, [[non-profit organization]] that promotes justice in Canadian [[Public policy (law)|public policy]] through research and analysis focused on poverty reduction, ecological justice, and refugee rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlson-Thies|first1=Stanley W.|first2=James W.|last2=Skillen|title=Welfare in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=to9Z-2ejikcC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22Citizens+for+Public+Justice%22+-inauthor:%22Citizens+for+Public+Justice%22|date=1996|page=111|publisher=Wm. B Eerdmans|isbn=9780802841278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPJ defines public justice as the political dimension of loving one's neighbour, caring for creation, and achieving the [[common good]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contributing to the Common Good|url=http://www.cpj.ca/files/docs/Contributing-to-the-Common-Good.pdf|accessdate=September 12, 2014|date=August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPJ's mission statement is "to promote public justice in Canada by shaping key public policy debates through research and analysis, publishing, and public dialogue. CPJ encourages citizens, leaders in society, and governments to support policies and practices which reflect God's call for love, justice, and the flourishing of Creation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.crcna.org/pages/publicdialogue_partners.cfm|title=Partner Organizations - Christian Reformed Church|publisher=Christian Reformed Church in North America|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPJ is a registered charity in Canada whose work is funded through donations from private individuals and members, as well as from churches and foundational grants. Its board of directors is made up of 13 representatives from all regions of Canada. Directors can sit a maximum of two three-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.ca/board|title=Board of Directors|publisher=Citizens for Public Justice|location=Ottawa, ON|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, CPJ celebrated its 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.christianweek.org/citizens-for-public-justice-celebrates-the-past-looks-to-the-future/|title=Citizens for Public Justice celebrates the past, looks to the future|last=Epp|first=Aaron|date=May 9, 2013|newspaper=Christian Week|location=Winnipeg, MB|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPJ is an affiliate member of the [[Canadian Council of Churches]] (CCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.councilofchurches.ca/about-us/members/|title=Members - Canadian Council of Churches|publisher=Canadian Council of Churches|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===1960s: Founding===
CPJ was founded in Toronto in 1963 as the Committee for Justice and Liberty (CJL Foundation) by Gerald Vandezande.&lt;ref name="Remembering Gerald Vandezande"&gt;{{cite news|last=Volman|first=Ben|title=Remembering Gerald Vandezande|url=http://www.christianweek.org/remembering-gerald-vandezande/|accessdate=August 26, 2014|newspaper=Christian Week|location=Winnipeg, MB|date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, it merged with the Alberta-based Christian Action Foundation, led by John Olthuis who joined Vandezande in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gruending|first= Dennis|title=Citizens for Public Justice questions tar sands|url=http://www.dennisgruending.ca/2008/06/citizens-for-public-justice-questions-tar-sands/|accessdate=August 26, 2014|date=June 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s: Mackenzie Valley Pipeline===
In the 1970s, the CJL Foundation campaigned against the proposed [[Mackenzie Valley Pipeline]], which would have been built through the traditional land of the Dene people in the Mackenzie Valley of the Northwest Territories in order to send fossil fuels from the Beaufort Sea to American consumers. Appearing before the [[Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry|Berger Inquiry]], the CJL Foundation called for a 10-year moratorium on the projects.&lt;ref name="Canada's Unassuming Prophet"&gt;{{cite news|last=Volman|first=Ben|title=Canada's Unassuming Prophet|url=http://digital.faithtoday.ca/faithtoday/20090708/?pg=25#pg25|page=25|accessdate=August 26, 2014|newspaper=Faith Today|location=Richmond Hill, ON|date=July–August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reiterated by John Olthuis, Hugh McCullum, and Karmel McCullum in their book ''Moratorium'' and later become a major recommendation of the [[Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry]] by Justice [[Thomas R. Berger]].&lt;ref name="Anglican Book Centre"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = McCullum | first1 = Hugh | first2 = Karmel | last2 = McCullum  | first3 =John | last3 = Olthuis|title=Moratorium: Justice, Energy, the North, and the Native People|location=Toronto, ON| publisher = Anglican Book Centre| isbn=0-919030-17-3|date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tommy Douglas]], leader of the NDP, asked to buy hundreds of copies of the book to distribute on Parliament Hill. Eventually, [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]]'s government declared a moratorium. This achievement is generally considered to be one of CPJ's biggest impacts, and an early victory for the group.&lt;ref name="Nation to Nation"&gt;{{cite book|last1 =Bird| first1 = John | first2 = Lorraine | last2 = Land  | first3 =Murray | last3 = MacAdam|title=Nation to Nation: Aboriginal Sovereignty and the Future of Canada|location=Toronto,ON| publisher = Irwin Publishing|isbn = 0-7725-2918-3|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s: Grassy Narrows First Nation===
In 1982, the CJL Foundation's focus shifted to federal public policy. It officially changed its name to Citizens for Public Justice (CPJ) and drafted ''Guidelines for Christian Political Service'' and ''The Charter of Social Rights and Responsibilities''.&lt;ref name="Canada's Unassuming Prophet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 =Bauman| first1 = Richard W. | first2 = Tsvi | last2 = Kahana|title=The Least Examined Branch The Role of Legislatures in the Constitutional State|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521859549|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandezande 1983"&gt;{{cite book |last= Vandezande|first= Gerald|title=Christians in the Crisis: Toward Responsible Citizenship|location=Toronto, ON| publisher =Anglican Book Centre|date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early 1980s, CPJ opened regional offices in Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver, while its national office stayed in Toronto. Kathy Vandergrift, a staffer in the Edmonton office, was named Edmonton's Citizen of the Year for proposing what turned into the Blue Box Recycling Program. CPJ was very involved in the push to get that program implemented, conducting workshops in schools &amp; churches, distributing brochures, and forming the Edmonton Recycling Society, who would run the first recycling centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gunn|first=Joe|title=Reaching for Right Relationships: CPJ at 50|location=Ottawa, ON| url=http://www.cpj.ca/files/docs/Catalyst-Summer-2013.pdf|accessdate=August 20, 2014|newspaper=The Catalyst|date=Summer 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Olthuis began representing the [[Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation|Grassy Narrows First Nation]] whose homeland had been contaminated with mercury. In 1985, a compensation settlement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vecsey|first=Christopher|title=Grassy Narrows Reserve: Mercury Pollution, Social Disruption, and Natural Resources: A Question of Autonomy|url=http://freegrassy.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Academic-article-1987.pdf|accessdate=September 5, 2014|newspaper=American Indian Quarterly|volume=11|issue=4|date=Autumn 1987|pages=287–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, CPJ proposed a national Social Development and Job Creation fund. Then, in 1986, CPJ introduced the idea of a government tithe, whereby the government would use 10% of its budget to help the poor. The Toronto Star gave the idea front page coverage, and it was covered by other secular and Christian media as it had received support from Christian leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacAdam|first=Murray|title=50th Anniversary Reflection|url=http://www.cpj.ca/content/50th-anniversary-reflector-murray-macadam|accessdate=September 5, 2014|publisher=Citizens for Public Justice|date=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Harry Kits became CPJ's Executive Director.&lt;ref name="Building public justice together"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kits|first=Harry|title=Building public justice together: CPJ's 50th anniversary|location = St. Catharines, ON| url=http://www.christiancourier.ca/images/uploads/past-issues/13Dec23c.pdf|accessdate=September 5, 2014|newspaper=Christian Courier|date=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s: Child poverty and refugee rights===
In 1991, CPJ closed its regional offices and moved all of its operations back to Toronto.&lt;ref name="Building public justice together"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lyon | first1 = David | first2 = Marguerite | last2 = Van Die |title=Rethinking Church, State, and Modernity: Canada Between Europe and America|publisher = University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|date=2000|isbn=0802082130}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this they also changed their work to focus on a few key issues in order to get more in depth with each one. This led to more attention being put on research and education around refugee rights and poverty in Canada.

In the 1990s, CPJ focused on aboriginal rights, poverty, and refugee rights. It was vocal in its support of the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Land|first=Lorraine|title=Recipe for Assimilation or a New Relationship? The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples Report|url=http://www.oktlaw.com/publications/lorraine-land/|accessdate=September 5, 2014|newspaper=The Catalyst|location=Ottawa, ON|date=January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the early 2000s, CPJ opposed the widely criticized [[British Columbia aboriginal treaty referendum, 2002|British Columbia aboriginal treaty referendum]] around First Nations treaty rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Referendum on Treaty Negotiations: Make your vote count for justice|url=http://www.cpj.ca/files/docs/CPJ_s_BC_referendum_package.pdf|accessdate=September 9, 2014|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramsay|first=Heather|title=Candidates Court First Nations Voters|url=https://thetyee.ca/News/2005/04/08/CandidatesCourtFirstNations/|publisher=The Tyee|date=April 8, 2005|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, CPJ and [[Campaign 2000]] launched "Let's Invest in Canada's Children," a campaign to end child poverty in Canada. CPJ, The Canadian Islamic Congress, and the Canadian Council for Reform Judaism appeared jointly in front of the House of Commons Finance Committee to emphasize the inter-faith support for anti-poverty measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Child Poverty in Canada|url=http://www.canadianislamiccongress.com/cic2010/1999/11/19/friday-magazine-volume-2-issue-56/|location=Saskatoon, SK|accessdate=September 5, 2014|newspaper=Friday Magazine|date=November 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 to 2000, CPJ spoke out against the so-called "head tax," the Right of Landing fee of $975 charged to Convention refugees upon arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kits|first=Harry|title=Betwixt and Between: Refugees and Stateless Persons in Limbo|url=http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/refuge/article/view/21327/19998|accessdate=September 5, 2014|newspaper=Refuge|location=Toronto, ON|at=Volume 22, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fee was removed in the 2000 federal budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ending limbo for refugees|url=http://maytree.com/PDF_Files/SummaryCitizensForPublicJusticeEndingLimboForRefugees.pdf|publisher=Maytree Foundation|accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had also been working on the student loans for refugees issue, and saw a victory on that in the early 2000s.

===2000s: Move to Ottawa===

The new millennium marked many changes for CPJ. In August 22, 2001, Vandezande received the Order of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Order of Canada Gerald Vandezande, C.M. |url=http://www.gg.ca/honour.aspx?id=6767&amp;t=12&amp;ln=Vandezande|date=2001|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPJ was recognized with a certificate of appreciation from the Somali Canadian Advocacy Network for their refugee work,&lt;ref name="Round Up"&gt;The Catalyst, April–May 2001. Retrieved on June 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which continued throughout the decade. CPJ also began its anti-poverty work, educating the public and conducting research. This all led up to the launch of the Dignity for All campaign in 2009.&lt;ref name="Dignity for All home page"&gt;[http://www.dignityforall.ca/en Dignity for All], retrieved July 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

CPJ moved its headquarters from Toronto to Ottawa in 2007. One of the main reasons behind the move was that CPJ felt that, since they focused mainly on federal issues, being closer to Parliament could help their cause. Their announcement explained that "public justice calls us to be where the conversations are happening and to bring our more than 40 years of insight, analysis and tested positions. CPJ has a vision of Canada that embraces pluralism, that asks who benefits from policies, and that puts forward helpful alternatives. A national office in Ottawa will let us advance that vision more effectively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mackey|first=Lloyd|title=OttawaWatch: Some Canada Day highlights|url=http://canadianchristianity.com/nationalupdates/2007/070507ottawa.html|accessdate=August 26, 2014|newspaper=Canadian Christianity|location=Vancouver, BC|date=July 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The move was accompanied by staff changes, and in 2008 Joe Gunn became the Executive Director of CPJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: CPJ Board announces new Executive Director|url=http://www.cpj.ca/press-release-cpj-board-announces-new-executive-director|publisher=Citizens for Public Justice|accessdate=September 10, 2014|location=Ottawa, ON|date= April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Joe Gunn was awarded the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal for his work in bringing faith communities together behind the ''Interfaith Call for Leadership and Action on Climate Change.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpj.ca/joe-gunn-receives-diamond-jubilee-medal|title=Joe Gunn receives Diamond Jubilee Medal|last=|first=|date=December 19, 2012|website=Citizens for Public Justice|publisher=|access-date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPJ's founder Gerald Vandezande died in 2011 at the age of 77, but his legacy continues through the work of CPJ.&lt;ref name="Remembering Gerald Vandezande"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada's Unassuming Prophet"/&gt;

==Current work==

===Poverty in Canada===

In 2009, Citizens for Public Justice and [[Canada Without Poverty]] founded Dignity for All, a non-partisan campaign which calls for a national anti-poverty plan for Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dignityforall.ca/en/about-dignity-all|title=About Dignity for All|publisher=Dignity for All|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year on October 17, the Dignity for All campaign marks the [[International Day for the Eradication of Poverty]] with events across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/food-bank-volunteers-fed-up-with-government-inaction-228077151.html|title=Food Bank Volunteers Fed Up with Government Inaction|date=October 16, 2013|newspaper=PR Newswire|location=Ottawa, ON|accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign has been endorsed by many MPs and Senators, including Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]], NDP leader [[Thomas Mulcair]], Green Party leader [[Elizabeth May]]; Senators [[Art Eggleton]] and [[Janis Johnson]]; Ministers [[Marc Garneau]], [[Scott Brison]], [[Carolyn Bennett]], [[John McCallum]], and [[Kirsty Duncan]]; and MPs [[Scott Armstrong (politician)|Scott Armstrong]], [[Gerry Byrne (politician)|Gerry Byrne]], [[Nathan Cullen]], [[Joyce Murray]], [[Niki Ashton]], and [[Charlie Angus]]. As well, over 600 organizations and 11,000 individuals have signed the Dignity for All call to action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dignityforall.ca/en/federal-political-endorsements|title=Federal Political Endorsements|publisher=Dignity for All|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPJ assisted in establishing the All-Party Anti-Poverty Caucus. The group, made up of MPs and Senators of all parties, meets regularly to discuss concrete policy proposals that will end poverty in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://youngvoices.canadianmennonite.org/articles/politicaladvocacydysfunctionaltimes|title=Political advocacy in dysfunctional times|last=van Wensem|first=Casey|date=2012|newspaper=Canadian Mennonite|accessdate=September 11, 2014|location=Winnipeg, MB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, CPJ helped to gather interfaith leaders in Ottawa to sign the Interfaith Declaration on Poverty in Canada. Signatories included the [[Canadian Council of Churches]], The Canadian Interfaith Delegation – World Religions Summit 2010, the [[Evangelical Fellowship of Canada]], and the Dignity for All campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.councilofchurches.ca/interfaith-declaration-on-poverty-in-canada/|title=Interfaith Declaration on Poverty in Canada|publisher=Canadian Council of Churches|accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spring 2015, CPJ organized "Justice Tour 2015," a delegation of national church leaders who traveled to eight cities to engage people of faith in conversations about poverty in Canada and climate change.&lt;ref name="The Ecology of Religion"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alternativesjournal.ca/people-and-profiles/ecology-religion|title=The Ecology of Religion|date=2016-06-10|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the tour, CPJ helped to coordinate "On Promoting Climate Justice and Ending Poverty in Canada," an inter-faith declaration from Canadian faith leaders. This was the first such declaration in four years and was endorsed by over 65 signatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.councilofchurches.ca/faith-climate-justice/|title=Canadian faith leaders call for climate justice «  Canadian Council of Churches|website=www.councilofchurches.ca|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dignity for All campaign released its model National Anti-Poverty Plan for Canada in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/02/03/canada-needs-a-plan-on-poverty-says-campaign-group.html|title=Canada 'needs a plan' on poverty, says campaign group {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after this release, MPs passed a nearly-unanimous motion calling on the government "to eradicate child poverty in Canada by developing a national poverty reduction plan."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/5327391-scarborough-mp-s-motion-to-end-child-poverty-in-canada-passed-by-house-of-commons/|title=Scarborough MP's motion to end child poverty in Canada passed by House of Commons|last=InsideToronto.com|website=www.insidetoronto.com|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the federal government announced plans to develop a plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister-families-children-and-social-development-mandate-letter|title=Minister of Families, Children and Social Development Mandate Letter (September 1, 2016)|date=2015-11-12|work=Prime Minister of Canada|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was active during the federal government's 2017 consultation regarding its forth-coming national anti-poverty plan.

Every October, CPJ releases a report on poverty in Canada. In 2017, CPJ released "Poverty Trends 2017." The report shows the unequal impact of poverty on certain groups, such as new immigrants, families led by single mothers, un-attached adults, youth, and Aboriginal people. It also presents poverty rates for each province and territory as well as many big cities and small communities across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thetyee.ca/News/2017/10/12/People-Disabilities-Poverty-Trap/|title=People With Disabilities in Poverty Trap, Says Report {{!}} The Tyee|last=Nuttall|first=Jeremy J.|date=2017-10-12|work=The Tyee|access-date=2018-05-09|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological Justice===
Building on its history of environmental engagement – including the successful call for a moratorium on the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline in the 1970s and the introduction of municipal recycling programs in the 1980s - CPJ supports effective action to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|editor-last=Swift|editor-first=Richard|title=The Great Revenue Robbery: How to Stop the Tax Cut Scam and Save Canada|publisher=Between the Lines|pages=101–112|date=2013|isbn=978-1-77113-103-2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 5, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; CPJ is a member of [[Climate Action Network|Climate Action Network Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://climateactionnetwork.ca/who-we-are/our-members/|title=Our Members - Climate Action Network Canada|publisher = Climate Action Network Canada|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Green Economy Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://greeneconomynet.ca/about-us/gen-member-organizations/|title=GEN Member Organizations|date=2014-07-29|work=GEN|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, CPJ and the [[Canadian Council of Churches]] developed the Canadian Interfaith Call for Leadership and Action on Climate Change, an ecumenical statement endorsed by over 60 faith institutions in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.councilofchurches.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Taking_Call_COP17.pdf|title=Canadian Interfaith Call for Leadership and Action on Climate Change|publisher=Canadian Council of Churches|date=December 2013|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPJ's Executive Director, Joe Gunn, contributed a chapter entitled "Taxes and Ecological Justice?" to the book, The Great Revenue Robbery from Canadians for Tax Fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swift|first=Richard|title=The Great Revenue Robbery: How to Stop the Tax Cut Scam and Save Canada|location=Toronto, ON| publisher =Between the Lines|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[Pembina Institute]] recognized CPJ's executive director, Joe Gunn as a "Clean Energy Champion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pembina.org/blog/657|title=Clean Energy Champions:  Joe Gunn collaborates with Pembina Institute to mobilize the faith community on ecological justice issues|last=Institute|first=Pembina|website=Pembina Institute|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, CPJ published Living Faithfully into a New Climate, a series of faith and climate resources linked to the UN Climate Summit in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cpj.ca/climate|title=Church Resources: Ecological Justice|last=|first=|date=2016-03-13|website=Citizens for Public Justice|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, CPJ coordinated an interfaith prayer vigil to mark COP20 in Lima.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dennisgruending.ca/2014/12/light-for-lima/|title=Light for Lima|date=2014-12-12|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, CPJ coordinated an interfaith, cross-Canada prayer chain throughout the two weeks of international climate negotiations at COP21 in Paris.&lt;ref name="The Ecology of Religion" /&gt; This was followed in 2016 by a series of actions through which CPJ mobilized Canadians and called for a Canadian climate action plan that establishes a new emissions reduction target and contributes towards meeting Canada's commitment in the [[Paris Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cpj.ca/public-justice-vision-canadas-climate-action-plan|title=A Public Justice Vision for Canada's Climate Action Plan|last=CPJ|date=2016-06-05|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPJ launched a new campaign in 2017 called "Give it up for the Earth!" During Lent, Christian across Canada made personal pledges to reduce their carbon footprint. The campaign also included a postcard calling on the Canadian government to pursuing policy changes to fight climate change and meet the [[Paris Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.anglicanjournal.com/articles/anglican-parishes-pledge-to-give-it-up-for-the-earth-this-lent/|title=Anglican parishes pledge to 'give it up for the Earth' this Lent – Anglican Journal|date=2017-03-09|work=Anglican Journal|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, CPJ released "A Half Welcome," a report on private sponsorship issues in Canada highlights refugee sponsorship agreements holders' (SAHs) top concerns with federal government policy, including long wait times, long wait times for non-Syrian applications, allocations limits, and travel loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.catholicregister.org/item/24984-immigration-minister-vows-faster-processing-times-for-refugees|title=Immigration minister vows faster processing times for refugees|last=Register|first=Michael Swan, The Catholic|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dahan-e Gholaman''' (''Dahan-i Ġulāmān'') or ''Dahaneh-e Gholaman'' is the modern name of a major [[Achaemenid Dynasty|Achaemenid]] center and archeological site in eastern [[Iran]].  It has been identified as Zranka/Zarin, the capital of the satrapy of Zranka/[[Drangiana]].
&lt;!--- Write your article below this line ---&gt;

==Geography==
The archeological site known as Dahan-e Gholaman or Dahaneh-e Gholaman ("Gateway of the Slaves") is located some 30&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the modern city of [[Zabol]] on a neck of land separating two of the modern Chah Nimeh reservoirs, about 8.5&amp;nbsp;km from the nearest point on the [[Iran]]-[[Afghanistan]] border.&lt;ref&gt;Gnoli (1993); the site's location can be verified on satellite maps at the specified coordinates.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeology==
Dahan-e Gholaman is the largest Achaemenid site in all of eastern Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammadkhani (2012) 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 27 structures aligned roughly in a straight line running SW to NE along the northern edge of the site were excavated by the Italian archeologist U. Scerrato in 1962-1965 and by the Iranian archeologist S. M. S. Sajjadi in 2000-2005.  Further geophysical and surface exploration in 2007-2011 revealed the outline of another monumental building situated 2&amp;nbsp;km south of the northern complex of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammadkhani (2012) 1-2, 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of the larger structures excavated or detected at Dahan-e Gholaman have regular rectangular or square plans and bear comparison with the palatial buildings and audience halls of the Achaemenid royal residences at [[Pasargadae]] and [[Persepolis]], as well as Dasht-e Gohar.&lt;ref&gt;Gnoli (1993); Mohammadkhani (2012) 8-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the structures has been identified as a religious building, its three altars possibly dedicated to the leading Persian gods [[Ahura Mazda]], [[Anahita]], and [[Mithra]].&lt;ref&gt;Gnoli (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification and History==
The size of the site, unparalleled in eastern Iran, and the characteristic layout of its public structures indicate that it served as a significant Achaemenid administrative center.  Consequently, Dahan-e Gholaman has been identified as the capital of the Achaemenid province of Zranka/[[Drangiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Scerrato (1966) 11; Gnoli (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the site's ancient name was also probably Zranka or, a variation, Zarin.&lt;ref&gt;Gnoli (1993); Talbert (2000) 3 H3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The site's features exhibit parallels to those attested in the reign of [[Darius I]] (522-486 BC), which would match the expected overall time-frame for its construction.&lt;ref&gt;Gnoli (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of stratigraphy at the site suggests a relatively short period of urban habitation,&lt;ref&gt;Gnoli (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; and it probably did not survive much beyond the Achaemenid period (c. 550-330 BC).  In particular, if the identification with the capital of Zranka/Drangiana is correct, the site would have been visited by [[Alexander the Great]] during his pursuit of the usurper [[Bessus|Bessos]] and his conquest of the region in the winter of 330-329 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;  After the decline and abandonment of Dahan-e Gholaman, the administrative center of the region was transferred 31&amp;nbsp;km to the northeast, to Nād-i `Alī in what is now Afghanistan, which was called Zaranj (or Zarang) in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;  The name has since been transferred, yet again, to the modern city of [[Zaranj]] in Afghanistan, located 4.4 km south of medieval Zaranj (Nād-i `Alī) and 28 km northeast of ancient Zranka (Dahan-e Gholaman).

'''''De Brevitate Vitae''''' ({{lang-en|On the Shortness of Life}}) is a moral [[essay]] written by [[Seneca the Younger]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosopher]], sometime around the year 49 AD, to his father-in-law Paulinus. The philosopher brings up many [[Stoicism|Stoic]] principles on the nature of [[time]], namely that people waste much of it in meaningless pursuits.  According to the essay, nature gives people enough time to do what is really important and the individual must allot it properly. In general, time is best used by living in the present moment in pursuit of the intentional, purposeful life.

Similar ideas can be found in Seneca's treatise ''[[De Otio]]'' (''On Leisure'') and discussion of these themes can often be found in his ''[[Letters to Lucilius]]'' (letter 49, 101, etc.).

==Date and addressee==
The work is addressed to a man called Paulinus&amp;mdash;probably Pompeius Paulinus, a knight of [[Arelate]]&amp;mdash;and is usually dated to around 49 AD. It is clear from chapters 18 and 19 of ''De Brevitate Vitae'' that Paulinus was ''[[praefectus annonae]]'', the official who superintended the grain supply of Rome, and was, therefore, a man of importance. He was likely a near relative of Seneca's wife, [[Pompeia Paulina]], and quite plausibly her father. He is also thought to be the father of another [[Pompeius Paullinus|Pompeius Paulinus]], who held high public posts under [[Nero]] ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Nat. Hist.'' xxxiii. 143; [[Tacitus]], ''Annals'', xiii. 53. 2; xv. 18. 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lucius Annaeus Seneca:On the Shortness of Life|first=John W.|last=Basore|publisher=William Heinemann Loeb Classical Library|year=1932|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the date of composition, it must have been after the death of [[Caligula]] (41 AD), which Seneca mentions in §18.5. Furthermore, there are two known periods when Paulinus could have served as ''praefectus annonae'', 48–55 and 62–71 AD, and scholars prefer the earlier period. A date of 49 AD has previously been suggested because Seneca writes in §13.8 "that [[Sulla]] was the last of the Romans who extended the ''[[pomerium]]''" (the boundary of [[Rome]]). Since [[Claudius]] extended this in 49/50 AD, it would have been written before this. However [[Miriam Griffin]] has argued that Seneca is quoting a pedant who is asserting that Claudius' extension was illegal, which would mean that Seneca was writing after this date. Griffin has suggested that Seneca wrote ''De Brevitate Vitae'' as an excuse for Paulinus to retire early in 55 AD.&lt;ref name="smithy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott Smith|first=R.|chapter=De Brevitate Vitae|title=Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist|pages=161–6|editor1-first=Andreas|editor1-last=Heil|editor2-first=Gregor|editor2-last=Damschen|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004217088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
In chapter 1 Seneca counters the complaint that life is too short with the view that life is long enough if well-managed. Chapters 2 to 9 survey the many ways in which life is squandered and time frittered away by those people (''occupati'') engrossed in pointless pursuits. Chapters 10 to 17 contrast the philosophical approach to leisure (''[[otium]]'') with the deluded common approach. This culminates in chapters 18 to 20 showing the emancipation of the wise, who can soar above the lives of others mired in endless preoccupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=G. D.|title=Seneca: De Otio, De Brevitate Vitae|year=2003|page=19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521588065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics===
After the introduction (§1), Seneca reviews (§2–3) the distractions which make life seem short, and explains that people are great wasters of time. He then offers (§4–6) three examples of famous Romans ([[Augustus]], [[Cicero]] and [[Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Livius Drusus]]) who, in various ways, were victims of the engrossed life. He explains (§7–8) that the engrossed do not know how to live or have awareness, and that they waste time because they do not know its value. One should purposefully live for the moment (§9), because tomorrow will be too late. In contrast (§10) the lives of the engrossed seem so short to them because they are constrained to the fleeting present, and recollect the past in pain. They desperately cling on to life (§11) because they haven't lived, unlike the wise, who are always ready to leave life behind. The engrossed include those who live in leisure and luxury (§12), and Seneca explains (§13) that even those who devote themselves to scholarship are wasting their time if their efforts are directed to no end. Accordingly, (§14–15) only those who dedicate their time properly truly live, becoming equal with the great minds of the past, allowing the mind of the sage to even transcend time, like a god. The engrossed, on the other hand, (§16–17) are prey to fidgety and contradictory moods, and their joys and pleasures are bitter with the sense of precariousness. Finally (§18–19) Seneca exhorts Paulinus to abandon public occupations and adopt the contemplative life of the wise, free from the passions. This is contrasted (§20) with the suffering of the engrossed: they die without having ever lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.|last=Traina|title=La brevità della vita|language=it|publisher=BUR Biblioteca Univ. Rizzoli|year=1993|isbn=8817169404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In the treatise Seneca argues that we waste so much time because we do not properly value it. We expend great effort in protecting other valuables such as money and property, but because time appears intangible, we allow others to occupy it and take time away from us. Wise people, on the other hand, understand that time is the most valuable of all resources, and with effort can free themselves from external control to engage in meaningful introspection and create an intentional life.&lt;ref name="smithy"/&gt;

Seneca urges his readers to live in the present, and adapt themselves to a purposeful life in agreement with Nature. Only by doing so, can one then truly unlock both past and future. The completeness of each present moment allows one's awareness to expand to the equal of that of the universe, and achieve true virtue and happiness.&lt;ref name="smithy"/&gt;

The statements which urge Paulinus to retire from public life are in notable contrast to Seneca's advice in his ''[[De Tranquillitate Animi]]'' (to his friend [[Annaeus Serenus]]) to seek public employments in order to render life attractive.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SIoFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=The+stoic+sage+Seneca+de+tranquilitates+animi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VwoKVYG-GcvnUsS5gdAD&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20stoic%20sage%20Seneca%20de%20tranquilitates%20animi&amp;f=false Seneca as a Moralist and Philosopher]" in ''The National quarterly review'', p. 18, published 1868 (ed. by [[Edward Isidore Sears|E. I. Sears]]). Retrieved 2017-11-21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his related treatise, ''[[De Otio]]'', Seneca makes the point that there is no inconsistency, and that one can serve the greater community in either or both roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott Smith|first=R.|chapter=De Otio|title=Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist|pages=150|editor1-first=Andreas|editor1-last=Heil|editor2-first=Gregor|editor2-last=Damschen|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004217088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Dog]]s''' (''Canis lupus familiaris''), which are mankind's first and most common [[Domestication|domestic animal]]s, have played a role in many religious traditions.

== Religions and cultures ==
Below entries are arranged in alphabetical order.

=== Aztec religion ===
{{Further|Dogs in Mesoamerican folklore and myth}}
Dogs had a major religious and symbolic significance to the [[Aztec]] peoples of central [[Mexico]]. Several ancient burial sites for dogs have been discovered in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ancient-dog-burial-site-found-mexico-city|title=Aztec dog burial site found in Mexico City|author=Olga R. Rodriguez|publisher=Associated Press|date=Feb 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xolotl]], an Aztec god of death, was depicted as a dog-headed monster.

=== Chinese tradition ===
{{Further|Dog (zodiac)|Dog in Chinese mythology}}
The dog is one of the 12 animals honored in [[Chinese astrology]]. The second day of the [[Chinese New Year]] is considered to be the birthday of all dogs and Chinese people often take care to be kind to dogs on that day.

[[Panhu]] is a dragon-dog who transformed into a man and married a princess.

=== Christianity ===
[[File:St Rochus.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Statue of [[Saint Roch]] with his dog, in [[Prague]], Czech Republic.]]
A dog is mentioned in the deuterocanonical [[Book of Tobit]], faithfully accompanying Tobias, Tobit's son and the angel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] on their journeys.

[[Jesus]] told the story of the poor man [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus]], whose sores were licked by street dogs. This has traditionally been seen as showing Lazarus's wretched situation.

The [[Catholic Church]] recognizes [[Saint Roch]] (also called Saint Rocco), who lived in the early 14th century in France, as the [[patron saint]] of dogs. It is said that he caught the [[Black Death|plague]] while doing charitable work and went into the forest, expecting to die. There he was befriended by a dog which licked his sores and brought him food, and he was able to recover. The [[feast day]] of Saint Roch, August 16, is celebrated in [[Bolivia]] as the "birthday of all dogs."&lt;ref name="culturalcatholic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalcatholic.com/SaintRoch.htm |title=Cultural Catholic - Saint Roch (Saint Rocco) |author=Webmaster (webmaster@culturalcatholic.com)|publisher=culturalcatholic.com|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Guinefort]] was the name given to a dog who received local veneration as a [[saint]] at a French shrine from the 13th to the 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen de Bourbon (died 1262): ''De Supersticione''&lt;/ref&gt;

A black and white dog is sometimes used as an informal symbol of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] order of [[friar]]s, religious sisters and [[nuns]]. This stems from a Latin pun: though the order's name is actually the Friars Preachers (''Ordus Praedicatorum'' - order of preachers), it is generally called the Dominicans (after St. Dominic, their founder): ''Domini canes'' in Latin means "the dogs/hounds of the Lord."

=== Ancient Egyptian religion ===
The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians are often more associated with cats in the form of [[Bastet]], yet here too, dogs are found to have a sacred role and figure as an important symbol in religious iconography.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Egyptian Religion: An Interpretation|author=Frankfort, H.|date=2011|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=9780486411385|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYhfazYeAnUC|page=9|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs were associated with [[Anubis]], the jackal headed god of the underworld. At times throughout its period of being in use the Anubieion catacombs at [[Saqqara]] saw the burial of dogs.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt|author=Bard, K.A.|date=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203982839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNdgScxtirYC|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek mythology ===

Dogs were closely associated with [[Hecate]] in the Classical world. Dogs were sacred to [[Artemis]] and [[Ares]]. [[Cerberus]] was the three-faced guard dog of the Underworld. Laelaps was a dog in Greek mythology. When Zeus was a baby, a dog, known only as the “golden hound” was charged with protecting the future King of Gods. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/content/animals/animals/breeds/dogtopics/dog_mythology.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
[[File:Bhairav.JPG|thumb|150px|right|[[Bhairava]] with his dog.]]
{{see|Category:Dogs in Hinduism}}
The dogs are worshipped as a part of a five-day [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] festival that falls roughly in November every year. 
The dog (''[[Shvan]]'') is also the [[vahana]] or mount of the Hindu god [[Bhairava]]. [[Yudhishthira]] had approached heaven with his dog,&lt;ref&gt;Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, p. 53, by Wendy Doniger, publisher = Manchester University Press&lt;/ref&gt; therefore among many Hindus, the common belief exists that caring for or adopting dogs can also pave way to heaven.

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Islam and dogs}}

The majority of both Sunni and Shi'a Muslim jurists consider dogs to be [[Ritual purification|ritually unclean]].&lt;ref name="Fadl"&gt;[http://www.scholarofthehouse.org/dinistrandna.html ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature''], s.v. "Dogs in the Islamic Tradition and Nature." New York: Continuum International, forthcoming 2004. By: Dr. Khaled Abou El Fadl&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncommon for practising Muslims to have dogs as pets.&lt;ref name="Forw"&gt;Susan J. Armstrong, Richard G. Botzler, ''The Animal Ethics Reader'', p.237, Routledge (UK) Press&lt;/ref&gt; They are viewed as [[scavenger]]s.&lt;ref name="Sherman2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sherman, Josepha |title=Storytelling: An Encyclopedia of Mythology and Folklore|date=August 2008|publisher=Sharpe Reference|isbn=978-0-7656-8047-1|pages=118–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In Britain, police [[sniffer dog]]s are carefully used, and are not permitted to contact passengers, only their luggage. They are required to wear leather [[dog booties]] when searching mosques or Muslim homes.&lt;ref name=Dale&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/steve-dales-pet-world/2015/03/muslims-object-to-dogs/|title=Muslims Object to Dogs|work=ChicagoNow|author=Steve Dale|date=March 2, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620230926/http://www.chicagonow.com/steve-dales-pet-world/2015/03/muslims-object-to-dogs/|archivedate=June 20, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1029887/Muslims-searched-sniffer-dogs-despite-religious-objections-say-police.html|title=Muslims will be searched by sniffer dogs despite religious objections, say police|work=Daily Mail|date=27 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of traditions concerning [[Muhammad]]'s attitude towards dogs. He said that the company of dogs, except as helpers in hunting, herding, and home protection, voided a portion of a Muslim's good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malik ibn Anas]], [[Muwatta Imam Malik|al-Muwatta]] (Egypt: al-Babi al-Halabi, n.d.), 2:969. Reported in El Fadl&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, he advocated kindness to dogs and other animals.  &lt;ref&gt;Abu Huraira Volume 3, Book 40, Number 551.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quranx.com"&gt;https://quranx.com/Hadith/Bukhari/USC-MSA/Volume-3/Book-40/Hadith-551 Compendium of Muslim Texts - Abu Huraira, Volume 3, Book 40, Number 551&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu Huraira]] narrated that the prophet said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"While a man was walking he felt thirsty and went down a well, and drank water from it. On coming out of it, he saw a dog panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man said, 'This (dog) is suffering from the same problem as that of mine.' So, he (went down the well), filled his shoe with water, caught hold of it with his teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Allah thanked him for his (good) deed and forgave him.'' The people asked ``O Allah's Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving (the) animals?'' He replied: ``Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate (living being).''&lt;ref name="quranx.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Judaism ===

In [[Judaism]], [[Jewish law]] does not ban the action of keeping dogs and other pets.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/animals.html|title=Judaism &amp; The Treatment of Animals |work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish law requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves, and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt; The Book of Exodus (22:31) includes the exhortation "And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs" which implies that dogs have an accepted role in Hebrew society, and that God does not expect them to observe the dietary restrictions imposed on their human masters. The name of the Biblical character [[Caleb]] is written the same way as ''keleb'' ({{lang-he|כָּ֫לֶב}}), meaning "dog" - written Hebrew having no [[vowel]]s. The Bible was written down centuries before [[Hebrew diacritics]] were introduced, and there is thus no certain knowledge of how the name was pronounced during the man's own lifetime - leaving open the possibility that at that time it was no dishonor for a major tribal leader to be named "Dog".

=== Mesopotamia ===
There is a temple in Isin, Mesopotamia, named é-ur-gi7-ra which translates as “dog house”&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, A (1988). "The Isin “Dog House” Revisited", Journal of Cuneiform Studies, '''40''' (1), p54&lt;/ref&gt; Enlilbani, a king from the Old Babylonian First Dynasty of Isin, commemorated the temple to the goddess Ninisina.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Aaron (1974). "Enlilbaniand the ‘DogHouse’ in Isin", Journal of Cuneiform Studies, 26(4) p. 251-252)&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is a small amount of detail known about it, there is enough information to confirm that a dog cult did exist in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone ibid, 1988, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, dogs were only associated with the Gula cult, but there is some information, like Enlilbani’s commemoration, to suggest that dogs were also important to the cult of Ninisina, as Gula was another goddess who was closely associated to Ninisina.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Aaron (1974) Ibid, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; More than 30 dog burials, numerous dog sculptures, and dog drawings were discovered when the area around this Ninisina temple was excavated. In the Gula cult, the dog was used in oaths and was sometimes referred to as a divinity.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=== Philistines ===

At archaeological diggings at the [[Philistines| Philistine]] city of [[Ashkelon]], [[Ashkelon dog cemetery|a very large dog cemetery]] was discovered in the layer dating from when the city was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire| Persian Empire]]. It is believed the dogs may have had a sacred role - however, evidence for this is not conclusive.

=== Zoroastrianism ===
In [[Zoroastrianism]], the dog is regarded as an especially beneficent, clean and righteous creature, which must be fed and taken care of.&lt;ref name=boyce&gt;Boyce, Mary 1989. A History of Zoroastrianism: The Early Period. P.303&lt;/ref&gt; The dog is praised for the useful work it performs in the household,&lt;ref name="avesta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd13sbe.htm |title=AVESTA: VENDIDAD (English): Fargard 13. |&lt;!--########## Vendidad 13:39-40 #########--&gt; |author=Joseph H. Peterson|publisher=avesta.org|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also seen as having special spiritual virtues. A dog's gaze is considered to be purifying and to drive off [[daeva]]s (demons). It is also believed to have a special connection with the [[afterlife]]: the [[Chinvat Bridge|Chinwad Bridge]] to Heaven is said to be guarded by dogs in Zoroastrian scripture,&lt;ref name="avesta"/&gt; and dogs are traditionally fed in commemoration of the dead.&lt;ref name=iranica/&gt; ''Ihtiram-i sag'', "respect for the dog", is a common injunction among Iranian Zoroastrian villagers.&lt;ref name=boyce/&gt;

Detailed prescriptions for the appropriate treatment of dogs are found in the [[Vendidad]] (a subdivision of the Zoroastrian holy scripture [[Avesta]]), especially in chapters 13, 14 and 15, where harsh punishments are imposed for harm inflicted upon a dog and the faithful are required to assist dogs, both domestic and stray, in various ways; often, help or harm to a dog is equated with help and harm to a human.&lt;ref name="avesta2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd_tc.htm |title=AVESTA: VENDIDAD: Table of Contents |&lt;!--########## Vendidad 13,14,15 #########--&gt; |author=Joseph H. Peterson|publisher=avesta.org|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killing of a dog ("a shepherd's dog, or a house-dog, or a Vohunazga [i.e. stray] dog, or a trained dog") is considered to lead to damnation in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="avesta2"/&gt; A homeowner is required to take care of a pregnant dog that lies near his home at least until the puppies are born (and in some cases until the puppies are old enough to take care of themselves, namely six months). If the homeowner does not help the dog and the puppies come to harm as a result, "he shall pay for it the penalty for wilful murder", because "[[Atar]] (Fire), the son of [[Ahura Mazda]], watches as well (over a pregnant dog) as he does over a woman".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd15sbe.htm Vendidad, Fargard 15], passim, e.g. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a major sin if a man harms a dog by giving it bones that are too hard and become stuck in its throat, or food that is too hot, so that it burns its throat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd15sbe.htm Vendidad, Fargard 15], 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Giving bad food to a dog is as bad as serving bad food to a human.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd15sbe.htm Vendidad, Fargard 13, 20-28&lt;/ref&gt; The believers are required to take care of a dog with a damaged sense of smell, to try to heal it "in the same manner as they would do for one of the faithful" and, if they fail, to tie it lest it should fall into a hole or a body of water and be harmed.&lt;ref name="avesta"/&gt;

Both according to the Vendidad and in traditional Zoroastrian practice, dogs are allotted some funerary ceremonies analogous to those of humans.&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;Encyclopaedia Iranica:Dog. In Zoroastrianism. By Mary Boyce.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Vendidad, it is stated that the spirits of a thousand deceased dogs are reincarnated in a single [[otter]] ("water dog"), hence the killing of an otter is a terrible crime that brings drought and famine upon the land and must be atoned either by the death of the killer&lt;ref name="avesta"/&gt; or by the killer performing a very long list of deeds considered pious, including the healing of dogs, raising of puppies, paying of fines to priests, as well as killing of animals considered noxious and unholy (cats, rats, mice and various species of reptiles, amphibians, and insects).&lt;ref name="avesta3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd14sbe.htm|title=AVESTA: VENDIDAD (English): Fargard 14.|author=Joseph H. Peterson|publisher=avesta.org|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sagdid]]'' is a funeral [[ceremony]] in which a dog is brought into the room where the body is lying so that it can look on it. “Sagdid” means “dog sight” in the [[Middle Persian|Middle Persian language]] of Zoroastrian theological works. There are various spiritual benefits thought to be obtained by the ceremony. It is believed that the original purpose was to make certain that the person was really dead, since the dog’s more acute senses would be able to detect signs of life that a human might miss. A “four-eyed” dog, that is one with two spots on its forehead, is preferred for sagdid.&lt;ref&gt;Jivanji Jamshedji Modi, 1928, [http://www.avesta.org/ritual/funeral.htm The Funeral Ceremonies of the Parsees], Anthropological Society of Bombay&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research, by Solomon Alexander Nigosian, Published by McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 1993, {{ISBN|0-7735-1144-X}}, 9780773511446 page 102 (page can be viewed via Google books)&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional rites involving dogs have been under attack by reformist Zoroastrians since the mid-19th century, and they had abandoned them completely by the late 20th century. Even traditionalist Zoroastrians tend to restrict such rites to a significant extent nowadays (late 20th - early 21st century).&lt;ref name=iranica/&gt;

==Criticism of religion==
The Ancient Greek philosopher and critic of social mores [[Diogenes of Sinope#Diogenes the dog|Diogenes of Sinope]] was recorded as living with many dogs, seeing their freedom from self-consciousness and sincere enjoyment of simple physical pleasure to be admirable role models.

In an article in the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' [[atheist]] [[Natalie Angier]] quoted [[Frans de Waal]], a [[Primatology|primatologist]] at [[Emory University]]:
:"I've argued that many of what philosophers call moral sentiments can be seen in other species. In [[chimpanzee]]s and other animals, you see examples of sympathy, empathy, reciprocity, a willingness to follow social rules. Dogs are a good example of a species that have and obey social rules; that's why we like them so much, even though they're large [[carnivores]]."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20010114mag-atheism.html |title=Confessions of a Lonely Atheist |&lt;!--########## "Confessions of a Lonely Atheist" #########--&gt; |publisher=partners.nytimes.com|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Landseer Saved.jpg|thumb|A [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], the breed Byron eulogized, painted by [[Edwin Henry Landseer]], 1802–1873]]
In 1808 the English poet [[Lord Byron]] expressed similar thoughts in his famous poem ''[[Epitaph to a Dog]]'':
:But the poor dog, in life the firmest friend,
:The first to welcome, foremost to defend,
:Whose honest heart is still his master's own,
:Who labors, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,
:Unhonored falls, unnoticed all his worth,
:Denied in heaven the soul he held on earth –
:While man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,
:And claims himself a sole exclusive heaven.&lt;ref name="poetryloverspage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/byron/byron_ind.html |title=Poetry Lovers' Page: George Gordon Byron |&lt;!--########## Epitaph To a Dog #########--&gt; |publisher=poetryloverspage.com|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ebionites''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἐβιωναῖοι}}, ''Ebionaioi'', derived from [[Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|אביונים}} ''ebyonim'', ''ebionim'', meaning "the poor" or "poor ones") is a [[Patristics|patristic]] term referring to a [[Jewish Christian]] movement that existed during the [[Early Christianity|early centuries of the Christian Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor1-last = Cross | editor1-first = EA | title = The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1989 | contribution = Ebionites | editor2-last = Livingston | editor2-first = FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; They regarded [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]] while rejecting his divinity and
his [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/177608/Ebionites | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Ebionites}}&lt;/ref&gt; and insisted on the necessity of following [[Halakha|Jewish law and rites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Kaufmann | last = Kohler | chapter-url = http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=22&amp;letter=E | contribution = Ebionites | editor1-first = Isidore | editor1-last = Singer | editor2-first = Cyrus | editor2-last = Alder | title = Jewish Encyclopedia | year = 1901{{ndash}}1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used only one of the [[Jewish–Christian gospels]], the Hebrew Book of Matthew starting at chapter three; revered [[James, brother of Jesus|James, the brother of Jesus]] (James the Just); and rejected [[Paul the Apostle]] as an [[Antinomianism#Supporting Pauline passages|apostate from the Law]].&lt;ref name="Maccoby 1987"&gt;{{Cite book| author = [[Hyam Maccoby]]| title = The Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity| pages = 172–183.| publisher = HarperCollins | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-06-250585-8}}, [http://ebionite.tripod.com/mac15.htm an abridgement]&lt;/ref&gt; Their name suggests that they placed a special value on [[Vow of poverty|voluntary poverty]]. Ebionim was one of the terms used by the sect at [[Qumran]] who sought to separate themselves from the corruption of the Temple. Many believe that the Qumran sectarians were [[Essenes]].&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, Robert (2002), "James, the Brother of Jesus" (Watkins){{Page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since historical records by the Ebionites are scarce, fragmentary and disputed, much of what is known or conjectured about the Ebionites derives from the [[Church Fathers]] who wrote [[polemics]] against the Ebionites, who they deemed [[heresy|heretical]] [[Judaizers]].&lt;ref name="Klijn &amp; Reinink 1973"&gt;{{Cite book| first1 = AFJ | last1 = Klijn | first2 = GJ | last2 = Reinink | title = Patristic Evidence for Jewish-Christian Sects| publisher = Brill | year = 1973 | isbn = 90-04-03763-2}}{{Page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ebionites according to the Church Fathers|Church Fathers on the Ebionites]] (Wikisource).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, very little about the Ebionite sect or sects is known with certainty, and most, if not all, statements about them are conjectural.

At least one scholar distinguishes the Ebionites from other Jewish Christian groups, such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]].&lt;ref name= "Hegg 2007" /&gt; Other scholars, like the [[Church Fathers]] themselves from the first centuries after Jesus, consider the Ebionites identical with the Nazarenes.&lt;ref name= "Hegg 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal| first = Tim | last = Hegg | title = The Virgin Birth — An Inquiry into the Biblical Doctrine | publisher = TorahResource | year = 2007 | url = http://www.torahresource.com/EnglishArticles/VirginBirth.pdf | accessdate= 13 August 2007 | format =PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nazarene/Ebionite"&gt;Jeffrey Butz, ''The Secret Legacy of Jesus'', {{ISBN|978-1-59477-307-5}}, "In fact, the Ebionites and the Nazarenes are one and the same." pg 124;  "Following the devastation of the Jewish War, the Nazarenes took refuge in Pella, a community in exile, where they lay in anxious wait with their fellow Jews. From this point on it is preferable to call them the Ebionites. There was no clear demarcation or formal transition from Nazarene to Ebionite; there was no sudden change of theology or Christology.", pg 137; "While the writings of later church fathers speak of Nazarenes and Ebionites as if they were different Jewish Christian groups, they are mistaken in that assessment. The Nazarenes and the Ebionites were one and the same group, but for clarity we will refer to the pre-70 group in Jerusalem as Nazarenes, and the post-70 group in Pella and elsewhere as Ebionites.", pg 137;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The term ''Ebionites'' derives from the common adjective for "poor" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] (singular: {{Hebrew|אֶבְיוֹן}} ''ev·yōn'', plural: {{Hebrew|אביונים}} ''ev·yōn·im''),&lt;ref&gt;Online [[Gesenius]]' [http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H34&amp;t=KJV entry in Hebrew Lexicon, with link to 61 Hebrew Bible uses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uhlhorn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The word is still in use in that sense in contemporary Israeli Hebrew&lt;/ref&gt; which occurs fifteen times in the [[Psalms]] and was the self-given term of some pious Jewish circles (e.g. Psalm 69:33 ("For the LORD heareth the poor") and [[Habakkuk Commentary|1 QpHab]] XII, 3.6.10).&lt;ref name="RGG"/&gt;  The term "Ebionim" was also a self description given by the people who were living in Qumran, as shown in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].  The term "the poor" was at first a common designation for all Christians, a reference to their material and [[Vow of poverty|voluntary poverty]].&lt;ref name="Uhlhorn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Minucius Felix|Minucius Felix]], ''Octavius, 36'': "That we are called the poor is not our disgrace, but our glory."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Greek equivalent {{lang|grc|πτωχοί}})'' ptōkhoí'' appears in the [[New Testament]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2015:26;&amp;version=50; Romans 15, 26]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202:10;&amp;version=50; Galatians 2,10]), possibly as an honorary title of the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem Church]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The hellenized Hebrew term "Ebionite" (''Ebionai'') was first applied by [[Irenaeus]] in the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|second century]] without making mention of Nazarenes (c.180 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Antti Marjanen, Petri Luomanen "A companion to second-century Christian "heretics" p250 "It is interesting to note that the Ebionites first appear in the catalogues in the latter half of the second century.

== History ==
The earliest reference to a group that might fit the description of the later Ebionites appears in [[Justin Martyr]]'s ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'' (c. 140). Justin distinguishes between [[Jewish Christian]]s who observe the [[613 Mitzvot|Law of Moses]] but do not require its observance upon others and those who believe the Mosaic Law to be obligatory on all.&lt;ref name="Justin"&gt;Justin Martyr, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/01282.htm ''Dialogue with Trypho'', 47].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]] (c. 180) was probably the first to use the term "Ebionites" to describe a heretical judaizing sect, which he regarded as [[Legalism (theology)|stubbornly clinging to the Law]].&lt;ref name="Irenaeus"&gt;Irenaeus of Lyon, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'' [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103126.htm I, 26]; [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103321.htm III,21].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Origen]] (c. 212) remarks that the name derives from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "evyon," meaning "poor."&lt;ref&gt;Origen, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04124.htm ''De Principiis'', IV, 22].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] in the fourth century gives the questionable but also most complete account in his [[heresiology]] called ''[[Panarion]]'', denouncing eighty heretical sects, among them the Ebionites.&lt;ref name="Epiphanius30"&gt;Epiphanius of Salamis, ''[[Panarion]]'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch 1976"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Glenn Alan Koch| title = A Critical Investigation of Epiphanius' Knowledge of the Ebionites: A Translation and Critical Discussion of 'Panarion' 30| publisher = University of Pennsylvania| year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius mostly gives general descriptions of their religious beliefs and includes quotations from their [[Ebionites#Writings|gospel]]s, which have not survived. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica (2011), the Ebionite movement may have arisen about the time of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem]] (AD 70).&lt;ref&gt;author not given, [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9031860/Ebionite Encyclopædia Britannica article ''Ebionite'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul talks of his collection for the "poor among the saints" in the Jerusalem church, but this is generally taken as meaning the poorer members of the church rather than a schismatic group.&lt;ref&gt;Some scholars see the title present already in Paul's references to a collection for the "poor" in Jerusalem (Gal.1:10). But in Rom.15:26 Paul distinguishes this group from the other Jerusalem believers by speaking of "the poor among the saints." In 2 Cor.9:12 Paul further confirms the economic, or literal, aspect by speaking of the collection as making up for "the deficiencies of the saints". E. Stanley Jones, '"Ebionites", in ''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible,'' Amsterdam University Press, 2000 p.364.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual number of groups described as Ebionites is difficult to ascertain, as the contradictory [[patristic]] accounts in their attempt to distinguish various sects sometimes confuse them with each other.&lt;ref name="RGG"/&gt; Other groups mentioned are the [[Carpocrates|Carpocratians]], the [[Cerinthus|Cerinthians]], the [[Elcesaites]], the fourth century [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]] and the [[Sampsaeans]], most of whom were Jewish Christian sects who held [[Fathers of Christian Gnosticism|gnostic]] or other views rejected by the Ebionites. Epiphanius, however, mentions that a group of Ebionites came to embrace some of these views despite keeping their name.&lt;ref name="Wace 1911"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Henry Wace &amp; William Piercy | title = A Dictionary of Early Christian Biography | year = 1911 | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Ebionism%20and%20Ebionites| accessdate = 1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Ebionites are first mentioned as such in the second century, their earlier history and any relation to the first [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem church]] remains obscure and a matter of contention. There is no evidence linking the origin of the later sect of the Ebionites with the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] of 66–70 CE or with the Jerusalem church led by [[James, brother of Jesus|James]]. [[Eusebius]] relates a tradition, probably based on [[Aristo of Pella]], that the early Christians left Jerusalem just prior to the war and fled to [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]] beyond the [[Jordan River]], but does not connect this with Ebionites.&lt;ref name="Uhlhorn"&gt;G. Uhlhorn, "Ebionites", in: ''A Religious Encyclopaedia or Dictionary of Biblical, Historical, Doctrinal, and Practical Theology'', 3rd ed. (edited by Philip Schaff), p. 684–685 (vol. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RGG"&gt;O. Cullmann, "Ebioniten", in: ''Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', p. 7435 (vol. 2).&lt;/ref&gt; They were led by [[Simeon of Jerusalem]] (d. 107) and during the [[Second Jewish-Roman War]] of 115–117, they were persecuted by the Jewish followers of [[Bar Kochba]] for refusing to recognize his messianic claims.&lt;ref name="Wace 1911"/&gt;
[[File:Thedecapolis.png|right|thumb|200px|Map of the [[Decapolis]] showing the location of Pella.]]

According to Harnack, the influence of [[Elchasaites]] places some Ebionites in the context of the [[Gnosticism#Persian Gnosticism|gnostic movements widespread in Syria and the lands to the east]].&lt;ref name="RGG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harnack"&gt;[[Adolf von Harnack]], ''The History of Dogma'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19612/19612-h/19612-h.htm#SEC_I_VI_I "Chapter VI. The Christianity of the Jewish Christians"], 1907, {{ISBN|978-1-57910-067-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], the importance of the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem church]] began to fade. [[Jewish Christianity]] became dispersed throughout the [[Jewish diaspora]] in the [[Levant]], where it was slowly eclipsed by gentile Christianity, which then spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]] without competition from "judaizing" Christian groups.&lt;ref name="Brandon 1968"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Brandon, S.

According to [[Hyam Maccoby]] (1987), their decline was due to marginalization and "[[Persecution of Christians#Persecution of Christians by Christians|persecution]]" by both Jews and Christians.&lt;ref name="Maccoby 1987"/&gt; Following the defeat of the rebellion and the expulsion of all Jews from Judea, Jerusalem became the Gentile city of [[Aelia Capitolina]]. Many of the Jewish Christians residing at Pella renounced their Jewish practices at this time and joined to the mainstream Christian church. Those who remained at Pella and continued in obedience to the Law were deemed heretics.&lt;ref name="Gibbon 2003"&gt;{{Cite book| author = [[Edward Gibbon]]| title = [[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]], ch. 15, p. 390–391.| publisher = Random House, NY| year = 2003 | isbn = 0-375-75811-9}} {{Cite book | title = Chapter 15 | url = http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/g/gibbon/edward/g43d/chapter15.html | accessdate = 2 August 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906220839/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/g/gibbon/edward/g43d/chapter15.html | archivedate = 6 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 375, Epiphanius records the settlement of Ebionites on Cyprus, but by the fifth century, [[Theodoret|Theodoret of Cyrrhus]] reported that they were no longer present in the region.&lt;ref name="Wace 1911"/&gt;

===Last days of the Ebionite sect===
[[Image:Hijaz.png|thumb|left|250px|Map showing the historic region of Hejaz, outlined in red.]]
Some scholars argue that the Ebionites survived much longer and identify them with a sect encountered by the historian [[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad]] around the year 1000.&lt;ref name="Pines 1966"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Shlomo Pines|authorlink = Shlomo Pines| title = The Jewish Christians Of The Early Centuries Of Christianity According To A New Source | publisher = Proceedings of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities II, No. 13| year = 1966 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Jewish_Christians_of_the_early_centu.html?id=9yIUAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|oclc=13610178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another possible reference to Ebionite communities existing around the 11th century in northwestern [[Arabia]] in ''[[Sefer (Hebrew)|Sefer]] Ha'masaot,'' the "Book of the Travels" of Rabbi [[Benjamin of Tudela]], a rabbi from Spain. These communities were located in two cities, [[Tayma]] and "[[Tilmas]]",&lt;ref name="Adler 1907"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Marcus N. Adler| title = The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela: Critical Text, Translation and Commentary|pages=70–72| publisher = Phillip Feldheim| year = 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly [[Sa`dah]] in Yemen.

The 12th century Muslim historian [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] mentions Jews living in nearby [[Medina]] and [[Hejaz]] who accepted Jesus as a prophetic figure and followed traditional Judaism, rejecting mainstream [[Christian views of Jesus|Christian views]].&lt;ref name=" Shahrastani 1842"&gt;{{Cite book| author = [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]]| title = [[Kitab al–Milal wa al-Nihal|The Book of Religious and Philosophical Sects]], [[William Cureton]] edition|page=167| publisher = Gorgias Press| year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that they contributed to the development of the [[Islamic view of Jesus]] due to exchanges of Ebionite remnants with the first Muslims.&lt;ref name="RGG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schoeps 1969"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Hans-Joachim Schoeps| title = Jewish Christianity: Factional Disputes in the Early Church.

==Views and practices==

===Judaic and Gnostic Ebionitism===
Most patristic sources{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} portray the Ebionites as traditional Jews who zealously followed the [[613 Mitzvot|Law of Moses]], revered [[Jerusalem]] as the holiest city&lt;ref name="Irenaeus"/&gt; and restricted [[Kashrut#Maintenance of a separate culture|table fellowship]] only to Gentiles who [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]].&lt;ref name="Justin"/&gt;

Some Church Fathers describe some Ebionites as departing from traditional [[Jewish principles of faith]] and [[Orthopraxis#Judaism|practice]]. For example, [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] stated that the Ebionites engaged in excessive [[Mikvah|ritual bathing]],&lt;ref name="Epiphanius19"&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion'', 19:28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; possessed an [[angelology]] which claimed that the Christ is a great archangel who was incarnated in Jesus and [[adoptionism|adopted as the son of God]],&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion'', 30, 14, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Epiphanius 30-16"&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion'', 30, 16, 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; opposed [[Korban|animal sacrifice]],&lt;ref name="Epiphanius 30-16"/&gt; [[Antinomianism|denied parts or most of the Law]],&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion'', 30, 18, 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt; practiced [[Jewish vegetarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion'', 30.22.4&lt;/ref&gt; and celebrated a commemorative meal annually&lt;ref name="Ramsey 1912"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/624138| author = W.M.

[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103501.htm V, 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliability of Epiphanius' account of the Ebionites is questioned by some scholars.&lt;ref name="Klijn &amp; Reinink 1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Van Voorst 1989"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Robert E. van Voorst| authorlink = Robert E. Van Voorst| title = The Ascents of James: History and Theology of a Jewish-Christian Community| publisher = Society of Biblical Literature| year = 1989| isbn = 1-55540-294-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shlomo Pines]], for example, argues that the [[heterodox]] views and practices he ascribes to some Ebionites originated in [[Fathers of Christian Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]] rather than [[Jewish Christianity]] and are characteristics of the [[Elcesaites|Elcesaite]] sect, which Epiphanius mistakenly attributed to the Ebionites.&lt;ref name="Pines 1966"/&gt;

Another Church Father who described the Ebionites as departing from Christian Orthodoxy was [[Methodius of Olympus]], who stated that the Ebionites believed that the prophets spoke only by their own power and not by the power of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name="Oden2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas C. Oden|title=Ancient Christian commentary on Scripture: New Testament|url=https://books.google.com/?id=irWI6DUtPncC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=14 October 2010|year=2006|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-1497-8|pages=178–}} excerpt from St. Methodius of Olympus, ''Symposium on Virginity'', 8.10., "and with regard to the Spirit, such as the Ebionites, who contend that the prophets spoke only by their own power"&lt;/ref&gt;

While mainstream [[biblical scholarship|biblical scholars]] do suppose some Essene influence on the nascent Jewish-Christian Church in some organizational, administrative and cultic respects, some scholars go beyond that assumption.

Regarding the Ebionites specifically, a number of scholars have different theories on how the Ebionites may have developed from an Essene [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messianic]] sect. Hans-Joachim Schoeps argues that the conversion of some Essenes to Jewish Christianity after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE]] may be the source of some Ebionites adopting Essene views and practices,&lt;ref name="Schoeps 1969"/&gt; while some conclude that the Essenes did not become Jewish Christians, but still had an influence on the Ebionites.&lt;ref name="Stendahl 1991"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Kriste Stendahl | title = The Scrolls and the New Testament | publisher = Herder &amp; Herder | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-8245-1136-0}}{{Page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epiphanius of Salamis]], in his book Panarion, 30:17:5, said, "But I already showed above that Ebion did not know these things, but later, his followers that associated with Elchasai had the circumcision, the Sabbath and the customs of Ebion, but the imagination of Elchasai." Epiphanius made it clear that the original Ebionites were different from those heterodox Ebionites that he described.&lt;ref&gt;[[Epiphanius of Salamis]], Panarion, 30:17:5&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Ebionite views on John the Baptist===
In the ''[[Gospel of the Ebionites]]'', as quoted by Epiphanius, [[John the Baptist]] and Jesus are portrayed as [[Vegetarianism and religion|vegetarian]]s.&lt;ref name="Verheyden"&gt;J Verheyden, ''Epiphanius on the Ebionites'', in ''The image of the Judaeo-Christians in ancient Jewish and Christian literature'', eds Peter J.

This emendation is not found in any other New Testament manuscript or translation,&lt;ref&gt;''Textual Apparatus of the UBS Greek New Testament'' United Bible Societies 1993 - with Peshitta, Old Latin etc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James A.

Robert Eisenman suggests that the Ebonim followed the [[Nazirite]] Oath that was associated with "James the brother of Jesus"&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, Robert (2002), "James, the brother of Jesus."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jesus===
:''See also [[Jesus in the Talmud]]''
The majority of Church Fathers{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} agree that the Ebionites rejected many of the precepts central to [[Nicene Creed|Nicene orthodoxy]], such as Jesus' [[pre-existence of Christ|pre-existence]], [[divinity of Jesus|divinity]], [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], [[Atonement in Christianity|atoning]] [[death of Jesus|death]] and [[vision hypothesis|physical resurrection]].&lt;ref name="Klijn &amp; Reinink 1973"/&gt;
On the other hand, an Ebionite story has Jesus eating bread with his brother, [[James, brother of Jesus|Jacob]] ("James the Just"), after the resurrection, which indicates that the Ebionites, or at least the ones who accepted this version of the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]], believed in a physical resurrection of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of the Hebrews as quoted by Hieronymus (Jerome) in ''On Illustrious Men'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ebionites are described as emphasizing the [[unitarianism|oneness of God]] and the humanity of Jesus as the biological son of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], who by virtue of his [[Tzadik|righteousness]] was [[Chosen people|chosen]] by God to be the [[messiah|messianic]] "[[Prophet#Prophets in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible)|prophet]] like [[Moses]]" (foretold in ''[[Deuteronomy]]'' 18:14–22) when he was [[Anointing|anointed]] with the [[Shekhinah|Holy Spirit]] at his baptism.&lt;ref name="Maccoby 1987"/&gt; Origen (''[[Contra Celsum]]'' 5.61)&lt;ref&gt;Schaff ''A select library of Nicene and post-Nicene fathers of the Christian church'' 1904 footnote 828 "That there were two different views among the Ebionites as to the birth of Christ is stated frequently by Origen (cf. e.g. Contra Celsum V. 61), but there was unanimity in the denial of his pre-existence and essential divinity, and this constituted the essence of the heresy in the eyes of the Fathers from Irenæus on."&lt;/ref&gt; and Eusebius (''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' 3.27.3) recognize some variation in the [[Christology]] of Ebionite groups; for example, that while all Ebionites denied Jesus' pre-existence, there was a sub-group which did not deny the virgin birth.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J'' p9 Geoffrey W. Bromiley - 1982 article "Ebionites" citing E.H.3.27.3 "There were others, however, besides them, that were of the same name, that avoided the strange and absurd beliefs of the former, and did not deny that the Lord was born of a virgin and of the Holy Spirit. But nevertheless, inasmuch as they also refused to acknowledge that he pre-existed, being God, Word, and Wisdom, they turned aside into the impiety of the former, especially when they, like them, endeavored to observe strictly the bodily worship of the law." also source text [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.viii.xxvii.html online] at CCEL.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodoret]], while dependent on earlier writers,&lt;ref&gt;Albertus Frederik Johannes Klijn, G. J. Reinink  ''Patristic evidence for Jewish-Christian sects'' 1973 p42 "Irenaeus wrote that these Ebionites used the Gospel of Matthew, which explains Theodoret's remark. Unlike Eusebius, he did not link Irenaeus' reference to Matthew with Origen's remarks about the "Gospel of the Hebrews","&lt;/ref&gt; draws the conclusion that the two sub-groups would have used different Gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin K. Broadhead ''Jewish Ways of Following Jesus: Redrawing the Religious Map of Antiquity'' 2010 p209 "Theodoret describes two groups of Ebionites on the basis of their view of the virgin birth. Those who deny the virgin birth use the Gospel of the Hebrews; those who accept it use the Gospel of Matthew."&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the books of the [[New Testament]], the Ebionites are said to have accepted only a Hebrew (or Aramaic) version of the [[Gospel of Matthew]], referred to as the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]], as additional [[scripture]] to the [[Hebrew Bible]]. This version of Matthew, [[Irenaeus]] reports, omitted the first two chapters (on the [[nativity of Jesus]]) and started with the [[baptism of Jesus]] by [[John the Baptist|John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name="Irenaeus"/&gt;

The Ebionites believed that all Jews and [[Gentiles]] must observe the [[613 mitzvot|commandments]] in the Law of Moses&lt;ref name="Justin"/&gt; in order to become [[Tzadik|righteous]] and seek [[Devekut|communion with God]].&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus&lt;/ref&gt;

===James and the Ebionites===
{{undue weight section|date=July 2012}}
One of the popular primary connections of the Ebionites to James is that noted by [[William Whiston]] in his edition of Josephus (1794), where he notes regarding the murder of James, the brother of Jesus, "we must remember what we learn from the Ebionite fragments of Hegesippus, that these Ebionites interpreted a prophecy of Isaiah as foretelling this very murder."&lt;ref&gt;Whiston, W. Antiquities 2008 edition p594&lt;/ref&gt; That Hegesippus made this connection from Isaiah is undisputed;&lt;ref&gt;James the Just and Christian origins p217 Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans - 1999 "Isaiah 3:10 in its context expresses the link between the martyrdom of James and the fall of Jerusalem which the common source used by Hegesippus and the Second Apocalypse of James stressed "&lt;/ref&gt; however, Whiston's identification of Hegesippus as an Ebionite, while common in 18th and 19th century scholarship, is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Clay Sheldon -History of Christian Doctrine 1895 "But it is by no means clear that Hegesippus was an Ebionite. His description of James the Just scarcely goes further toward proving him an Ebionite than it does toward proving the same of Eusebius, who not only quotes his description..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The other popularly proposed connection is that the ''[[Ascents of James]]'' in the [[Pseudo-Clementine]] literature are related to the Ebionites.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Acts begins by showing Peter as leader of the Jerusalem church, the only church in existence immediately after the [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]], though several years later, Paul lists James prior to "Cephas" (Peter) and John as those considered "pillars" (Greek ''styloi'') of the Jerusalem Church.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Matera Galatians 2007 p77 "Here, Paul probably understands that James, Cephas, and John were considered to be pillars (styloi) of the Church."&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius records that [[Clement of Alexandria]] wrote that Peter, James and John chose James, the brother of Jesus, as bishop of Jerusalem, but Eusebius also subjects James to the authority of all the apostles.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Painter (theologian)|John Painter]], ''Just James'' (2005), p274: "Eusebius reported that Clement of Alexandria wrote that, after the ascension, Peter, James, and John chose James the Just as bishop of Jerusalem, although another quotation in Eusebius implies James's leadership from the time of the resurrection. Eusebius subjects James to the authority of all the apostles in a way that provides evidence of a struggle between the Great Church, represented here by the apostles and the independent authority of James"&lt;/ref&gt; Peter baptised [[Cornelius the Centurion]], introducing uncircumcised Gentiles into the church in Judea.&lt;ref&gt;Jesus in context: Temple, purity, and restoration Bruce Chilton, Craig A.

When Paul recounted the events to the Galatians ({{bibleverse||Galatians|2:9-10}}), he referred only to the remembrance of the poor rather than conveying the four points of the [[Council of Jerusalem]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|15:19-21}}). [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]]&lt;ref&gt;James D. G. Dunn ''Beginning from Jerusalem'' 2009 p1083 "This James is a much more conciliatory figure than he is usually thought to be."&lt;/ref&gt; notes the conciliatory role of James as depicted in Acts in the tension between Paul and those urging the Law of Moses upon Gentiles.

According to Eusebius, the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem church]] fled to [[Pella, Jordan]]&lt;ref&gt;Leon Morris ''The Gospel according to Matthew ''1992 p604 "but it is objected that Pella is not in fact in the mountains but at the foothills.

''Exposition of the Gospel according to Matthew'' 1973&lt;/ref&gt; after the death of James to escape the siege of the future [[Emperor Titus]].

Scholars, including Richard Bauckham, distinguish the high Christology practiced by the Jerusalem church under James with the low Christology later adopted by the Ebionites.&lt;ref&gt;Bauckham ‘We may now assert quite confidently that the self-consciously low Christology of the later Jewish sect known as the Ebionites does not, as has sometimes been asserted, go back to James and his circle in the early Jerusalem church.’ Richard Bauckham, 'James and Jesus,' in Bruce Chilton, Jacob Neusner, ''The brother of Jesus: James the Just and his mission,'' Westminster John Knox Press, 2001, pp.100-137, p.135.&lt;/ref&gt; Tabor argues&lt;ref name="Tabor 2006 Dynastic succession of James, Simon"&gt;Tabor (2006), p. 4-5, 79-80, 247, 249-251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Blessing of Africa: The Bible and African Christianity'', Keith Augustus Burton, Intervarsity Press 2007, pp. 116,117. {{ISBN|978-0-8308-2762-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Ebionites claimed a dynastic [[apostolic succession]] for the [[Desposyni|relatives of Jesus]]. Epiphanius relates that the Ebionites opposed the [[Apostle Paul]], who they saw as responsible for the idea that gentile Christians did not have to be [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]] or follow the [[613 Mitzvot|Law of Moses]], and named him an [[apostasy|apostate]].&lt;ref name="Irenaeus"/&gt; Epiphanius further relates that some Ebionites alleged that Paul was a Greek who [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]] in order to marry the daughter of a [[Kohen Gadol|high priest of Israel]], but apostatized when she rejected him.&lt;ref&gt;"[The Ebionites] declare that he was a Greek [...] He went up to Jerusalem, they say, and when he had spent some time there, he was seized with a passion to marry the daughter of the priest. For this reason he became a proselyte and was circumcised. Then, when he failed to get the girl, he flew into a rage and wrote against circumcision and against the sabbath and the Law " - Epiphanius of Salamis, ''Panarion'' 30.16.6-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Luomanen 2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Petri Luomanen|title=Jewish Christianity Reconsidered|page=88|publisher=Fortress Press|editor=Matt Jackson-McCabe|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8006-3865-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative to the traditional view of Eusebius that the Jerusalem church simply became integrated with the Gentile church, other scholars, such as [[Richard Bauckham]], suggest immediate successors to the Jerusalem church under James and the relatives of Jesus were the Nazoraeans who accepted Paul, while the Ebionites were a later offshoot of the early second century.&lt;ref name="Richard Bauckham 2003"&gt;{{cite book| author=Richard Bauckham| title=The Image of the Judeo-Christians in Ancient Jewish and Christian Literature| pages=162–181| publisher=Brill, Peter J.

==Writings==
Few writings of the Ebionites have survived and they are in uncertain form. The [[Clementine literature|''Recognitions of Clement'' and the ''Clementine Homilies'']], two third century Christian works, are regarded by general scholarly consensus as largely or entirely [[Jewish Christians|Jewish Christian]] in origin and reflect Jewish Christian beliefs. The exact relationship between the Ebionites and these writings is debated, but Epiphanius's description of some Ebionites in ''[[Panarion]]'' 30 bears a striking similarity to the ideas in the ''Recognitions'' and ''Homilies''. Scholar Glenn Alan Koch speculates that Epiphanius likely relied upon a version of the ''Homilies'' as a source document.&lt;ref name="Koch 1976"/&gt;  Some scholars also speculate that the core of the ''[[Gospel of Barnabas]]'', beneath a polemical medieval [[Islam|Muslim]] overlay, may have been based upon an Ebionite or gnostic document.&lt;ref name="Toland 1718"&gt;[[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]], ''Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile and Mahometan Christianity'', 1718.&lt;/ref&gt; The existence and origin of this source continues to be debated by scholars.&lt;ref name=" Blackhirst 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Blackhirst, R.| title = Barnabas and the Gospels: Was There an Early Gospel of Barnabas?, Journal of Higher Criticism, 7/1, p. 1–22| year = 2000| url = http://depts.drew.edu/jhc/Blackhirst_Barnabas.html| accessdate = 11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Arendzen]] ([[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article "Ebionites" 1909) classifies the Ebionite writings into four groups.&lt;ref name="Arendzen 1909"&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Ebionites}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gospel of the Ebionites===
Irenaeus stated that the Ebionites used [[Matthew's Gospel]] exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;''"Those who are called Ebionites accept that God made the world. However, their opinions with respect to the Lord are quite similar to those of Cerinthus and Carpocrates. They use ''Matthew's gospel'' only, and repudiate the Apostle Paul, maintaining that he was an apostate from the Law."'' - Irenaeus, ''Haer'' 1.26.2&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] wrote that they used only the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]].&lt;ref name="Eusebius IV"&gt;Eusebius of Caesarea, ''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm Church History]''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm , III, 27, 4.]&lt;/ref&gt; From this, the minority view of [[James R. Edwards]] (2009) and [[Bodley's Librarian]] [[Edward Nicholson (librarian)|Edward Nicholson]] (1879) claim that there was only one Hebrew gospel in circulation, Matthew's ''Gospel of the Hebrews''. They also note that the title ''Gospel of the Ebionites'' was never used by anyone in the early Church.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Edwards, ''The Hebrew Gospel &amp; the Development of the Synoptic Tradition'', 2009 Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co, 2009. pp 121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson ''The Gospel according to the Hebrews'', 1879 reprinted print on demand BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2009. pp 1-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Whiston &amp; H. Stebbing, ''The Life and Works of Flavius Josephus'', reprinted Vol II, Kessinger Publishing, 2006. p 576&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius contended that the gospel the Ebionites used was written by Matthew and called the ''Gospel of the Hebrews''.&lt;ref&gt;They too accept the Matthew's gospel, and like the followers of Cerinthus and Merinthus, they use it alone. They call it the ''Gospel of the Hebrews'', for in truth Matthew alone in the New Testament expounded and declared the ''Gospel in Hebrew'' using Hebrew script. - Epiphanius, ''Panarion'' 30.3.7&lt;/ref&gt; Because Epiphanius said that it was "not wholly complete, but falsified and mutilated",&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion'' 30.13.1&lt;/ref&gt; writers such as [[Walter Richard Cassels]] (1877) and [[Pierson Parker]] (1940) consider it a different "edition" of Matthew's [[Hebrew Gospel of Matthew|Hebrew Gospel]];&lt;ref&gt;Walter Richard Cassels, ''Supernatural Religion - An Inquiry into the Reality of Divine Revelation'', 1877 reprinted print on demand Read Books, 2010.   Vol. 1, p 419- 422&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierson Parker, ''A Proto-Lukan Basis for the Gospel According to the Hebrews'', Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 59, No. 4, 1940. pp 471&lt;/ref&gt;  however, internal evidence from the quotations in ''Panarion'' 30.13.4 and 30.13.7 suggest that the text was a Gospel harmony originally composed in Greek.&lt;ref name="Gospel of the Ebionites - The Complete Gospels p.436 1994"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Complete Gospels| page=436| publisher=Polebridge Press, Robert J. Miller ed.| year=1994| isbn=0-06-065587-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream scholarly texts, such as the standard edition of the [[New Testament Apocrypha]] edited by [[Wilhelm Schneemelcher]], generally refer to the text Jerome cites as used by the Ebionites as the ''Gospel of the Ebionites'', though this is not a term current in the Early Church.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Walter Funk,  ''The Gospel of Jesus: according to the Jesus Seminar'', Publisher Polebridge Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Cross and E.A. Livingston, ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church,''   1989, Oxford University Press, p. 438 - 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clementine literature===
The collection of [[New Testament apocrypha]] known as the [[Clementine literature]] included three works known in antiquity as the ''Circuits of Peter'', the ''Acts of the Apostles'' and a work usually titled the  ''Ascents of James''. They are specifically referenced by Epiphanius in his polemic against the Ebionites. The first-named books are substantially contained in the Homilies of Clement under the title of Clement's ''Compendium of Peter's itinerary sermons'' and in the ''Recognitions'' attributed to Clement. They form an early Christian didactic fiction to express Jewish Christian views, such as the primacy of [[James, brother of Jesus|James, the brother of Jesus]]; their connection with the [[Holy See|episcopal see of Rome]]; and their antagonism to [[Simon Magus]], as well as [[gnosticism|gnostic]] doctrines. Scholar [[Robert E. Van Voorst]] opines of the ''Ascents of James'' (R 1.33–71), "There is, in fact, no section of the Clementine literature about whose origin in Jewish Christianity one may be more certain".&lt;ref name=" Van Voorst 1989"/&gt; Despite this assertion, he expresses reservations that the material is genuinely Ebionite in origin.

===Symmachus===
Symmachus produced a translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] in [[Koine Greek]], which was used by Jerome and is still extant in fragments, and his lost ''[[Symmachus (translator)|Hypomnemata]]'', written to counter the canonical Gospel of Matthew. Although lost, the Hypomnemata&lt;ref name="Eusebius VI"&gt;Symmachus' Hypomnemata is mentioned by [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiae]]'', VI, xvii: "''As to these translators it should be stated that Symmachus was an Ebionite. But the heresy of the Ebionites, as it is called, asserts that Christ was the son of Joseph and Mary, considering him a mere man, and insists strongly on keeping the law in a Jewish manner, as we have seen already in this history. Commentaries of Symmachus are still extant in which he appears to support this heresy by attacking the Gospel of Matthew. Origen states that he obtained these and other commentaries of Symmachus on the Scriptures from a certain Juliana, who, he says, received the books by inheritance from Symmachus himself.''"; [[Jerome]], [[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De Viris Illustribus]]'', chapter 54, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm ''Church History'', VI, 17.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]], ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]'', [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm 54].&lt;/ref&gt; is probably identical to ''De distinctione præceptorum'' mentioned by Ebed Jesu (Assemani, ''Bibl. Or.'', III, 1). The identity of Symmachus as an Ebionite has been questioned in recent scholarship.&lt;ref name="Skarsaune 2007"&gt;{{cite book| author=Oscar Skarsaune| title=Jewish Believers in Jesus| pages=448–450| publisher=Hendrickson Publishers| year=2007| isbn=978-1-56563-763-4}} Skarsaune argues that Eusebius may have only ''inferred'' that Symmachus was an Ebionite based on his commentaries on certain passages in the Hebrew Scriptures. E.g., Eusebius mentions Isa 7:14 where Symmachus reads "young woman" based on the Hebrew text rather than "virgin" as in the LXX, and he interprets this commentary as attacking the Gospel of Matthew.(''Dem. ev.'' 7.1) and (''Hist. eccl.'' 5.17)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elkesaites===
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] (c.230) reported that a Jewish Christian, [[Alcibiades of Apamea]], appeared in Rome teaching from a book which he claimed to be the revelation which a righteous man, Elkesai, had received from an angel, though Hippolytus suspected that Alcibiades was himself the author.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard P. Luttikhuizen ''The revelation of Elchasai'' 1985 p216&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, [[Origen]] recorded a group, the Elkesaites, with the same beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Antti Marjanen, Petri Luomanen ''A companion to second-century Christian "heretics" p336&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius claimed the Ebionites also used this book as a source for some of their beliefs and practices (''Panarion'' 30.17).&lt;ref name="Koch 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Refutation of all Heresies|Philosophumena]]'', IX, 14-17. Luttikhuizen 1985 "Epiphanius deviates so strikingly from Hippolytus' account of the heresy of Alcibiades that we cannot possibly assume that he is dependent on the Refutation."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion'', 19, 1; 53, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius explains the origin of the name Elkesai to be [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''El Ksai'', meaning "hidden power" (''Panarion'' 19.2.1). Scholar Petri Luomanen believes the book to have been written originally in Aramaic as a Jewish apocalypse, probably in Babylonia in 116-117.&lt;ref&gt;Petri Luomanen (2007) ''Jewish Christianity Reconsidered'' pp.96, 299, 331:note 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious and critical perspectives==
The mainstream Christian view of the Ebionites is partly based on interpretation of the polemical views of the Church Fathers who portrayed them as [[Heresy|heretics]] for rejecting many of the central [[Christian views of Jesus]] and allegedly having an improper fixation on the [[613 Mitzvot|Law of Moses]] at the expense of the [[divine grace|grace of God]].&lt;ref name="Arendzen 1909"/&gt; In this view, the Ebionites may have been the descendants of a [[Jewish Christian]] sect within the early [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem church]] which broke away from its [[Pauline Christianity|mainstream theology]].&lt;ref name="Daniélou 1964"&gt;{{Cite book| author = [[Jean Daniélou]]| title = The theology of Jewish Christianity: The Development of Christian doctrine before the Council of Nicea | publisher = H. Regnery Co | year = 1964 | id = ASIN B0007FOFQI}}{{Page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern movements===
The [[counter-missionary]] group [[Jews for Judaism]] favorably mentions the historical Ebionites in their literature in order to argue that "[[Messianic Judaism]]", as promoted by missionary groups such as [[Jews for Jesus]], is [[Pauline Christianity]] misrepresenting itself as Judaism.&lt;ref name="Kravitz 2001"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Bentzion Kravitz| title = The Jewish Response to Missionaries: Counter-Missionary Handbook | publisher = [[Jews for Judaism]] International | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Messianic groups have expressed concern over leaders in Israel who deny Jesus' divinity and the possible collapse of the Messianic movement due to a resurgence of Ebionitism.&lt;ref name="Messianic Leaders Deny Yeshua"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Moshe Koniuchowsky| title = "Messianic" Leaders Deny Yeshua in Record Numbers| year = 2007| url = http://yourarmstoisrael.org/Editorials/?page=MESSIANIC_LEADERS_DENY&amp;type=2| accessdate = 21 July 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070812083612/http://yourarmstoisrael.org/Editorials/?page=MESSIANIC_LEADERS_DENY&amp;type=2| archivedate = 12 August 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Galatians"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = James Prasch| title = You Foolish Galatians, Who Bewitched You?

===Islam===
Islam charges Christianity  with having distorted the pure [[monotheism]] of [[Jesus]] through the doctrines of the [[Trinity]] and through the [[veneration]] of [[icon]]s. Paul Addae and Tim Bowes (1998) write that the Ebionites were faithful to the original teachings of [[Jesus]] and thus shared Islamic views about Jesus' humanity and also rejected the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|redemptive death]],&lt;ref&gt;Karl Baus ''From the Apostolic Community to Constantine'' Crossroad 1980 {{ISBN|978-0-824-50314-7}} page 155&lt;/ref&gt; though the [[Islamic view of Jesus]] may conflict with the view of some Ebionites regarding the virgin birth,&lt;ref name="al-Ashanti 2005"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Abdulhaq al-Ashanti &amp; Abdur-Rahmaan Bowes (Paul Addae and Tim Bowes 1998)| title = Before Nicea: The Early Followers of Prophet Jesus | publisher = Jamia Media | year = 2005  | isbn = 0-9551099-0-6}}{{Page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively denying and affirming, according to Epiphanius. One of the first men to believe in the [[prophethood]] of [[Muhammad]] was possibly an Ebionite {{citation needed|reason=Need source for him being specifically Ebionite|date=October 2014}} (sometimes argued to be Nestorian) &lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam, Online ed., Waraka b. Nawfal&lt;/ref&gt; [[monk]] named [[Waraqah ibn Nawfal]], the cousin of Mohammed's wife Khadija, who [[Muslim]]s honor as a pious man with deep knowledge of the [[Christian]] [[scripture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Muhammad: his life based on the earliest sources'', M. Lings, ''Suhail Academy Co.''{{Page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Joachim Schoeps]] observes that the Christianity Muhammad was likely to have encountered on the Arabian peninsula "was not the state religion of Byzantium but a schismatic Christianity characterized by Ebionite and [[Monophysite]] views."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Joachim Schoeps]], ''Jewish Christianity'' (Philadelphia: 1969), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Thus we have a paradox of world-historical proportions, viz., the fact that Jewish Christianity indeed disappeared within the Christian church, but was preserved in Islam and thereby extended some of its basic ideas even to our own day. According to Islamic doctrine, the Ebionite combination of Moses and Jesus found its fulfillment in Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Council Directive 2000/78/EC''', called '''Employment Equality Framework Directive''', is an [[Directive (European Union)|EU Directive]], and a major part of [[EU labour law]] which aims to combat discrimination on grounds of disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief and age in the workplace. It accompanies the [[Racial Equality Directive 2000]] and the [[Equal Treatment Directive 2006]] on gender.
It is implemented in the UK with the [[Equality Act 2010]]. Germany implemented the directive by creation of its General Act on Equal Treatment, "Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz (AGG)"

==Background==
Since the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] came into force in 1999, new EU laws, or [[EU Directive|Directives]], have been enacted in the area of anti-discrimination. The Directive entered into force on 2 December 2000 and gave member states three years to transpose the Directive into law, with an additional three years for legislation in the area of age and disability. In the [[Racial Equality Directive]] 2000/43/EC, there were two exemptions in Article 15 which both applied to Northern Ireland.

"1. To tackle the under-representation of one of the major religious communities in the police service of Northern Ireland, differences in treatment regarding recruitment into that service, including its support staff, shall not constitute discrimination insofar as those differences in treatment are expressly authorised by national legislation.
2. To maintain a balance of opportunity in employment for teachers in Northern Ireland while furthering the reconciliation of historical divisions between the major religious communities there, the provisions on religion or belief in this Directive shall not apply to the recruitment of teachers in schools in Northern Ireland in so far as this is expressly authorised by national legislation."

The '''Foundation Hindu Media''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohmnet.nl/generalInfo.aspx?lIntEntityId=15# English about page of OHM]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch: ''Organisatie Hindoe Media'' (abbr. ''OHM''), was a special broadcaster on the [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting]] system, which was allowed to broadcast on radio and television because of their religious background. They made programming for the Dutch [[Hindu]] community.

OHM was one of the "2.42 broadcasters" (named after the Article 2.42 of the ''Mediawet'', the Dutch media law, which allowed faith-based broadcasters to get airtime on radio and TV without having to have any members).

On January 1, 2016, the broadcasters in the [[Nederlandse Publieke Omroep (organization)|NPO]] were reduced to eight&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.government.nl/topics/the-media-and-broadcasting/media-act-rules-for-broadcasters-and-programming|title=Media Act: rules for broadcasters and programming|last=Zaken|first=Ministerie van Algemene|website=www.government.nl|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the 2.42-broadcasters, including OHM, ceased to exist.

== Etymology ==

The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''garuda'' meaning "eagle", and ''asana''  meaning "posture" or "seat".&lt;ref name="Sinha1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinha |first=S. C. |title=Dictionary of Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zzRvh1fRzEC&amp;pg=PA18 |date=1 June 1996 |publisher=Anmol Publications |isbn=978-81-7041-293-9 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu mythology [[Garuda]] is known as the king of birds. He transports the God Vishnu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.guimet.fr/Vishnu-Garudasana | title = Vishnu Garudasana | accessdate = 2011-06-25 | publisher = Musée Guimet | quote = This extremely well preserved work represents the god Vishnu astride his traditional mount, Garuda. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606094848/http://www.guimet.fr/Vishnu-Garudasana | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is eager to help humanity fight against demons. The word is usually rendered into English as "eagle", though the name literally means "devourer", because Garuda was originally identified with the "all-consuming fire of the sun's rays".&lt;ref name="Jordan2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jordan |first=Michael |title=Dictionary of gods and goddesses |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqDC5bwx4_wC&amp;pg=PA102 |date=August 2004 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-5923-2 |pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Garudasana eagle pose.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Garudasana]]

This standing asana may enhance concentration.&lt;ref name="VanEs2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=VanEs |first=Howard Allan |title=Beginning Yoga: A Practice Manual |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2x_HIoUN7AC&amp;pg=PA66 |date=12 November 2002 |publisher=Letsdoyoga.com |isbn=978-0-9722094-0-3|page=66 |quote=Builds balance, coordination, and concentration.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on the ankles, calves, thighs, hips and shoulders.

==Variations==
Usually Garudasana is performed with a straight spine, so that it shows the [[mythical]] [[bird]] [[Garuda]], but most people make their spine round, which could be interpreted as a mistake or a variation.

'''Hendrik''' "'''Hank'''" '''Hanegraaff''' (born 1950), also known as the "Bible Answer Man", is an American  Christian author and [[talk radio|radio talk-show]] host.  Formerly an [[Evangelical Christian]], he joined the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in 2017.&lt;ref name=bioequip&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.equip.org/hank-hanegraaff/ | title = Hank Hanegraaff | work= Christian Research Institute | accessdate = March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an outspoken figure within the [[Christian countercult movement]] where he has established a reputation for his criticisms of non-Christian [[World religions|religions]], [[new religious movements]] and [[cult]]s, as well as [[heresy in Christianity]]. He is also an [[Christian apologetics|apologist]] on [[doctrinal]] and cultural issues.

==Career==
Prior to becoming a leading figure in the Christian countercult movement, Hanegraaff was closely affiliated with the ministry of [[D. James Kennedy]] of [[Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church]] in Florida. During his association with Kennedy in the 1980s, he applied memory-based techniques (such as [[acrostic]] [[mnemonic]]s) to summarise strategies, methods and techniques in Christian [[evangelism]]. His work bears resemblances to memory dynamics techniques developed in speed-reading courses and in memory training programs used in some executive business courses.

During the late 1980s, Hanegraaff became associated with [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] at the [[Christian Research Institute]] (CRI), the conservative Protestant countercult and apologetic ministry which Martin founded in 1960.

After Martin's death from heart failure in June 1989, Hanegraaff became president of CRI. As part of his role as ministry president, Hanegraaff assumed the role from Martin of anchorman on the radio program ''The Bible Answer Man''. Hanegraaff became a conference speaker and itinerant preacher in churches, where he pursued the general ministry charter of CRI. Shortly after the release of [[Dan Brown]]'s novel, he co-authored ''The DaVinci Code: Fact or Fiction?'' with [[Lutheran]] [[apologist]] [[Paul Maier]].  His most recent publication is ''Has God Spoken?'', from [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] in 2011.

The content of The Bible Answer Man show includes answering questions about Christian doctrine, biblical interpretation, and denominational particularities, as well as special focuses on particular issues when a notable figure is a guest, such as frequent shows focused on [[Mormonism]] when former Mormons appear in studio as guests to speak from their experiences.

Throughout the 1990s, Hanegraaff engaged in dialogue with [[Joseph Tkach, Jr.]] and other leaders of the [[Grace Communion International|Worldwide Church of God]] (WCG), now known as Grace Communion International (GCI). The WCG was founded in the 1930s by [[Herbert W. Armstrong]], and had long been regarded as a cult by evangelicals, primarily for its denial of the [[Trinity]] and other traditional Christian doctrines. Following Armstrong's death in 1986, the group re-evaluated many of its teachings, including the [[British Israelism|British Israel]] doctrine and various [[Eschatology|eschatological]] predictions.  Hanegraaff was one of a handful of evangelical apologists, including Ruth A. Tucker, who assisted in the reforms. The biggest changes to ensure their acceptance among evangelicals were in accepting the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] and [[salvation]] by [[Divine grace|grace]] through [[Justification by faith|faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker |first=Ruth A. |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1996/july15/6t826a.html?paging=off |title=From the Fringe to the Fold |publisher=[[Christianity Today]] |date=July 15, 1996 | publication-date = July 1996 | volume = 40 | issue = 8 |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 defamation suit===
Hanegraaff sued longtime critic William Alnor for alleging that Hanegraaff's fundraising was under investigation for mail fraud. The allegation was based on an incident of misdirected mail which was followed by a January, 2005 CRI fundraising letter saying the error may have caused "perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars" in donations to be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/aprilweb-only/22.0a.html|title=Christian Research Institute Sues Longtime Critic: Hanegraaff says defamation must be answered.| magazine = [[Christianity Today]] | date = April 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defamation lawsuit was thrown out based on California's anti-[[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|SLAPP]]  statute. The court found that although Alnor’s statements regarding a mail fraud investigation were false, Hanegraaff was unlikely to prove "actual malice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2007/may/6.19.html|title= News Briefs|work =Christianity Today | date = April 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casp.net/california-anti-slapp-first-amendment-law-resources/caselaw/california-courts-of-appeal-cases/christian-research-institute-v-alnor-alnor-i/ Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (“Alnor I”)] California Anti-SLAPP Project&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
[[Answers in Genesis]], a Christian ministry that insists on a literal, fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible starting from Genesis, accused Hanegraaff of unorthodox beliefs. One of the creation science movement's main spokesmen, [[Ken Ham]], wrote in an article titled ''Hank Hanegraaff’s Abuse of Biblical Truth'', "it [is] evident that Hanegraaff does not hold to a literal Genesis...as he was unwilling to understand Genesis in its most natural form—historical narrative...it actually gets worse: Hanegraaff also denies there was a literal serpent in the Garden of Eden that audibly spoke to Eve...Christians like Hanegraaff wholeheartedly accept many secular humanistic ideas like long-age geology and the big bang. When they accept these competing (anti-biblical) claims and mix them with their Christianity, something always has to give. Most people give up what the Bible plainly says..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2013/05/09/hank-hanegraaffs-abuse-of-biblical-truth/|title=Hank Hanegraaff’s Abuse of Biblical Truth|website=Answers in Genesis|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

===Christianity in Crisis===
In his 1993 book ''Christianity in Crisis'', Hanegraaff charged the [[Word of Faith]] movement with heretical teachings, saying that many of the Word of Faith groups were cults, and that those who knowingly accepted the movement's theology were "clearly embracing a different gospel, which is in reality no gospel at all."&lt;ref&gt;Hank Hanegraaff, ''Christianity in Crisis'', Harvest House 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterfeit Revival===
Hanegraaff revisited some of the same issues in his 1997 book ''Counterfeit Revival'', in which he rejected the claims of many [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] teachers such as [[Rodney Howard Browne]] concerning what became known as the [[Toronto Blessing]]. The Toronto Blessing was associated with the [[Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship|Vineyard church]] located near the [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto Airport]], and was marked by spontaneous and sustained outbursts of bodily phenomena such as laughter, shaking, bouncing, and "resting in the Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1995/may15/5t6051.html|title = Toronto Blessing: Is It a Revival? | work = Christianity Today | date = May 15, 1995 | publication-date = May 1995  | volume = 39 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A different set of phenomena and claims subsequently emanated from churches in Brownsville, [[Pensacola, Florida]], and became known as the [[Brownsville Revival]].

One of the book's primary arguments is that many ostensible "manifestations of the Spirit" in charismatic, Pentecostal, and third wave affiliated churches are caused by [[psychological manipulation]] of parishioners, and that many of the "signs and wonders" claimed by these churches are fraudulent or result from manipulation, peer pressure, subtle suggestions, altered states of consciousness from repetitive chanting or singing, and expectations of supernatural events. Hanegraaff argues that many of the practices within these movements are not [[Bible|biblically]] sanctioned or appropriate, but have underlying aspects of scripture which are misinterpreted. He notes these movements rely too much on subjective experiences or feelings.

James A. Beverley,  professor of theology and ethics at Tyndale Seminary (formerly Ontario Theological Seminary) in Toronto, Canada, reviewed ''Counterfeit Revival'' in ''[[Christianity Today]]'', and wrote that while the book "exposes some real excesses and imbalances in the current charismatic renewal movements", it is a "misleading, simplistic, and harmful book, marred by faulty logic, outdated and limited research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Beverley | first = James A.  | url = http://www.ctlibrary.com/1358 | title = Books: Counterfeit Critique | publisher = [[Christianity Today]] |  date = September 1, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanegraaff responded on Equip.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hanegraaff  | first = Hank  | url = http://www.equip.org/articles/counterfeit-critique/ | title = Counterfeit Critique | publisher = [[Christian Research Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  by arguing that Beverley had received funding from Vineyard in the past and that he was aligned with them generally.  Hanegraaff intimated that Beverley had been compensated to author the "hit piece" for Christianity Today.

===Afterlife===
In 2013, Hanegraaff published the book ''Afterlife: What You Need To Know About Heaven, The Hereafter &amp; Near-Death Experiences'' where he addresses questions that were raised during his radio show regarding heaven and eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/interview-bible-answer-man-hank-hanegraaff-on-afterlife-part-1-91151/ |title=Interview: Bible Answer Man Hank Hanegraaff on 'Afterlife' (Part 1) |publisher=[[The Christian Post]] |date=2013-03-04 |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hanegraaff was born in the [[Netherlands]] and raised in the United States since childhood. He and his wife Kathy have twelve children. They lived in Southern California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ta-qOuhtGkAC |title=The Face That Demonstrates The Farce of Evolution - Hank Hanegraaff - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2001-02-16 |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now living in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=bioequip/&gt; On [[Palm Sunday]], 9 April 2017, Hanegraaff, together with his wife Kathy and two of his sons, were [[chrismation|chrismated]] into the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] at St. Nektarios Greek Orthodox Church in Charlotte, NC (a parish that is part of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2017/04/hank-hanegraaff-aka-bible-answer-man.html?m=1|title=Hank Hanegraaff (a.k.a.

In 2017 Hanegraaff revealed that he has [[mantle cell lymphoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/bible-answer-man-hank-hanegraaff-cancer-update-i-have-tumors-throughout-my-entire-body-183721/|title='Bible Answer Man' Hank Hanegraaff Cancer Update:  I Have Tumors Throughout My Entire Body|publisher=The Christian Post|date=2017-05-16|accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of a population of 8.9 million, persons of Indian origin and non-resident Indians together number 11,000 or 0.12%. A majority of them are [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]], [[Telugu people|Telugu's]],  [[Tamilian]]s and [[Kannadiga]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter11.pdf Indian diaspora]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of Arrival of Indians in Sweden==
Some Indian students who went to Sweden in the 1950s settled down there. Another stream of Indians came from [[Uganda]] in the 1970s. Some Indians sought and obtained political asylum after 1984. The Indian community is culturally very active. Different associations hold cultural functions and observe national days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter11.pdf ibid]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindus in Sweden==
[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51583.htm IRF 2005] reports that there are between 7,000 and 10,000 [[Hindu]]s.

Of the 10,000 Hindus, 2,000 are of Tamil Origin &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamilnation.org/diaspora/sweden.htm Tamilnation.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,500 are of Bengali Origin.

==Hindu Organisations in Sweden==
*Bengali Hindu Association
*Hindu Mandir Stockholm (Stockholm Hindu Temple) 
*[http://www.hinduunion.com Hindu Union] Jönköping
*[http://www.kannadakoota.org Stockholm Kannada Koota]
*The [[International Swaminarayan Satsang Organisation]] has a temple in [[Mariestad]]

==International Society for Krishna Consciousness in Sweden==
[[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]], the Krishna movement or Hare Krishna has its roots in the [[Hindu]] religion but perhaps does not see itself as a part of it even if most Hindus accept the Krishna movement as a part of the Hinduism.

The Krishna movement in Sweden functions from few places in Sweden. 
[[File:Korsnäs gård 2014d.jpg|thumb|Korsnäs gård, main building 2014.]]
* '''Korsnäs Gård''', in [[Botkyrka]] municipal in the [[Stockholm county]] , is an establishment on the countryside with a Hare Krishna temple. Korsnäs has as its main function to work with the publishing company BBT ([[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]]) who translates the Hare Krishna books to various languages for the entire world. The original books in English was translated by [[Srila Prabhupada]] who started the movement. Srila Prabhupada visited Sweden in 1973. 
* '''The Hare Krishna center''' in Stockholm runs a restaurant, a shop and a small temple. 
* '''The Almviks gård''' in the south of Stockholm County is also a country side establishment with a temple. Originally this was an agricultural cooperative but has later changed into a village project combining agriculture with families living there but working elsewhere.

'''Ananda Marga Pracaraka Samgha''' has been in Sweden since mid 1970's. Its primary training center is in Ydrefors,close to Kisa and Vimmerby. It also has been running an organic bakery called Sattva in Stockholm for over past two decades.Ananda Marga has been declared as a Shaivaita branch of Hindu religion by the Supreme Court of India. Ananda Marga prefers to call it as a universal religion based on universal spiritual practices like yoga and  meditation. Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiiji was the founder of Ananda Marga and lived from 1922-1990. He visited Stockholm in 1979. The religious teachers of Ananda Marga are called Acharyas and Avadhutas and addressed as Dadas (male teachers) and Didis (female teachers). The weekly service is called Dharma Cakra and is held in Stockholm at 27 Krukmakargatan, Mariatorget,Stockholm. A three hours akhanda Kiirtan is held once a month. Ananda Margiis (members of Ananda Marga) are strict vegetarians and do not eat onion,garlic and mushrooms also. Some margiis chose to be vegan. Ananda Marga recognises Shiva and Krishna as two god men who came on this earth as realized Masters. Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiiji falls in the same category.

{{Cannabis sidebar}}
The '''International Church of Cannabis''' is a [[religious organization]] in [[Denver]] that uses [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as a sacrament and adheres to no specific [[dogma]]. Its members, known as Elevationists, claim that the use of cannabis helps elevate people to a higher understanding of self.&lt;ref name=Fortin&gt;{{citation|title=Marijuana on Religious Grounds? A Cannabis Church Opens in Denver|author=Jacey Fortin|date=April 20, 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/us/international-church-cannabis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Technicolor /&gt;

The chapel headquarters, a converted old church painted by contemporary artists, opened its doors on [[420 (cannabis culture)|April 20]], 2017.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{citation|work=[[Merry Jane]]|title=Denver’s New “International Church of Cannabis” Will Open for Worship on 4/20|date=April 13, 2017|author=Zach Harris|url=https://www.merryjane.com/culture/denver-cannabis-church}}&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment banning cannabis consumption in churches was submitted to the [[Colorado House of Representatives]] on the same day and rejected as an [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] restriction on religion.&lt;ref name=Post /&gt;

Since smoking cannabis in public is banned in [[Colorado]], no cannabis consumption is allowed during the hours when the church is open to the public.&lt;ref name=About /&gt;&lt;ref name=Puff /&gt; A celebration of the "sacrament of cannabis," held only for members every Friday, is the only regular service in the church.&lt;ref name=Holy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pasquariello&gt;{{citation|title=Denver cannabis church's debut doesn't go exactly as planned|work=[[The Cannabist]]|publisher=Denver Post|date=April 21, 2017|author= Alex Pasquariello|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2017/04/21/international-church-of-cannabis-denver-420-debut-public-consumption/78098/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==

Members of the International Church of Cannabis are known as Elevationists. They ritually use cannabis, which they call "the sacred flower," to accelerate and deepen self-discovery. A member is considered awakened when their cannabis experience becomes [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] in nature. Elevationism claims no [[divine law]] and no unquestionable [[doctrine]], while following the [[Golden Rule]].&lt;ref name=About /&gt;&lt;ref name=Technicolor /&gt;

Since 420 is a [[420 (cannabis culture)|significant number for cannabis culture]], the church opened its doors to the public on April 20&lt;ref name=Technicolor /&gt; and its members light cannabis at 4:20 p.m.&lt;ref name=Fortin /&gt; This celebration of the "sacrament of cannabis," held every Friday, is the only regular service in the church.&lt;ref name=Holy /&gt; The symbol of the church is a set of interlocking triangles.&lt;ref name=Puff /&gt;

By itself, ritual use of cannabis is not a modern invention, as it appeared in several world religions over a period of 3,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=t1wdDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sacred Bliss: A Spiritual History of Cannabis|pages=7-9|last=Ferrara|first=Mark S.|date=2016|isbn=9781442271913|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the International Church of Cannabis is just one of several modern religious organizations that consider cannabis a sacrament.&lt;ref name=Holy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mensjournal.com/entertainment/articles/getting-high-and-holy-at-the-international-church-of-cannabis-w478721|title=Getting High and Holy at the International Church of Cannabis|last=Warner|first=Joel|publisher=Men's Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, the church announced that it would begin offering wedding services in a "cannabis-friendly" environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/denvers-international-church-of-cannabis-now-offering-weddings|title=Denver's International Church of Cannabis now offering 'weed weddings'|last=Garrison|first=Robert|publisher=The Denver Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==

Members of any religion can become Elevationists without the need to convert, since Elevationism is seen as a supplement rather than a replacement to existing faith. The only restriction is that persons under 21 years of age are not allowed into the church when cannabis is being burned.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elevationists.org/about|title=About Us|publisher=Elevationists}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church does not have a formal hierarchy.&lt;ref name=Technicolor /&gt;

The church’s membership increased to 200 people from around 50 on the opening week after increased media attention.&lt;ref name=Fortin /&gt; It allegedly rose to 500 in the next two weeks.&lt;ref name=Puff /&gt;

[[Dan Pabon]], a Democrat in the [[Colorado House of Representatives]], proposed an amendment banning cannabis consumption in churches on 20 April 2017, the same day the church opened. He confirmed that his move was inspired by the International Church of Cannabis. However, members of both parties in the House concluded it would be an [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] restriction on religion. They rejected his proposal and the amendment was not formally introduced.&lt;ref name=Fortin /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt;&lt;ref name=Post&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/04/20/cannabis-church-colorado-house-ban/|title=Colorado House rejects late attempt to bar pot use in churches|date=20 April 2017|publisher=The Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Church building ==

The church is housed in a 113-year-old structure in Denver’s [[Washington Park, Denver|Washington Park neighborhood]].&lt;ref name=Technicolor /&gt; It is a converted [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/04/17/the-international-church-of-cannabis-is-about-to-open-its-doors-6579180/|title=The International Church of Cannabis is about to open its doors|last=Sholl|first=Alice|date=17 April 2017|publisher=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt; which used to be called Mount Calvary Apostolic Church.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/04/20/latest-colorado-rejects-attempt-to-ban-pot-churches.html|title=The Latest: Colorado rejects attempt to ban pot churches|date=20 April 2017|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church property was purchased in July 2015 by a company co-owned by church co-founder Steve Berke and his parents with the intention to turn it into apartments. However, Berke's colleagues and friends, who later became co-founding members of the church, convinced him, and eventually the company, to establish a new church in lieu of converting the building into condos.&lt;ref name=9News /&gt;

An [[Indiegogo]] campaign to fund repairs on the building raised $40,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-international-church-of-cannabis-marijuana-community--2#/|title=The International Church of Cannabis|last=Gerson|first=Avi|publisher=IndieGoGo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renovations began July 2016.&lt;ref name=Perez&gt;{{citation|newspaper=The New York Post|title='Church of Cannabis' will open on 4/20 — of course|author=Chris Perez |date=April 12, 2017|url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/12/church-of-cannabis-will-open-on-420-of-course/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colorful surrealist interior paintings, with geometric neon colors and images of animals, were done by Spanish artist [[Okuda San Miguel]], who had already painted abandoned churches in Spain and Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://303magazine.com/2017/06/okuda-san-miguel-international-church-of-cannabis-art/|title=The Michelangelo of Cannabis - Meet Artist Okuda San Miguel|last=Bathgate|first=Rae|date=9 June 2017|publisher=303 Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; American artist [[Kenny Scharf]] painted the facade with graffiti-inspired murals.&lt;ref name=Puff /&gt;

In March 2017, Elevation Ministries established a two-year licensing and management agreement with Bang Digital Media, a publicly traded company founded by church co-founder Steve Berke, which does marketing work for the [[cannabis industry]].&lt;ref name=Pasq20170412/&gt;

|name = &lt;hiero&gt;i-z:f:t-G37&lt;/hiero&gt; &lt;ref name="Wörterbuch"&gt;[[Adolf Erman|Erman, Adolf]], and [[Hermann Grapow]], eds. 1926&amp;ndash;1953. ''Wörterbuch der aegyptischen Sprache im Auftrage der deutschen Akademien''. 6 vols. Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs'schen Buchhandlungen. (Reprinted Berlin: Akademie-Verlag GmbH, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;
|name explanation = Isfet&lt;br/&gt;ı͗zf.t&lt;br/&gt;'''Injustice/Violence'''
|}}

'''Isfet''' or '''Asfet''' (meaning "injustice", "chaos",  or "violence"; as a verb, “to do evil”&lt;ref name="Wörterbuch" /&gt;) is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian term from Egyptian [[Egyptian mythology|mythology]] used in [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy|philosophy]], which was built on a [[Religion|religious]], [[Society|social]] and [[Politics|politically]] affected [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]].&lt;ref name=DBR/&gt;
== Principles and ideology ==
''Isfet'' was thought to be the counterpart of the term ''[[Maat|Ma'at]]'' (meaning “(world-) order” or “harmony”). According to ancient Egyptian beliefs, Isfet and Ma'at built a complementary and also paradoxical dualism: one could not exist without its counterpart&lt;ref&gt;Maulana Karenga, Maat, ''The Moral Ideal in Ancient Egypt: A Study in Classical African Ethics''. (New York: Routeledge, 2003). {{ISBN|9781135937669}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Isfet and Ma'at balanced each other. Ma'at was to overcome isfet, "that which is difficult," "evil," "difficult," "disharmonious," and "troublesome." Isfet was to be overcome by good and to replace disunity with unity and disorder with order&lt;ref&gt; Asante, Molefi Kete. "Maat and Human Communication: Supporting Identity, Culture, and History Without Global Domination." ''Journal of Intercultural Communication Studies'' 20 (2011): 22.&lt;/ref&gt;. An Egyptian king ([[pharaoh]]) was appointed to “achieve” Ma'at, which means that he had to keep and protect justice and harmony by destroying Isfet. A responsible kingship meant that Egypt would remain in prosperity and at peace of Ma'at. However, if Isfet were to rise, humanity would decay and return to a primordial state. Decay was unacceptable as a natural course of events, which meant that the world was separated from the cosmos and away from order&lt;ref&gt;Goelet, Ogden. "Memphis and Thebes: Disaster and Renewal in Ancient Egyptian Consciousness. ''Journal of The Classical World'' 97 (2003):
 24.&lt;/ref&gt;. The universe was cyclical meaning it had repeated sequences: the daily sunsetting and its rising, annual seasons and flooding of the Nile. On the other hand, when Ma'at was absent, and Isfet unleashed then the Nile flood failed and the country fell into famine. Therefore, Ancient Egyptians believed through their rituals of the cosmic order it would bring forth prosperity to the gods and goddesses who controlled the cosmos&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, David P. ''Ancient Egypt''. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003). ISBN 80195219524 &lt;/ref&gt;.The principles of the contrariness between Isfet and Ma'at are exemplified in a popular tale from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], called "the moaning of the Bedouin":
::''Those who destroy the lie promote Ma'at;'' 
::''those who promote the good will erase the evil.'' 
::''As fullness casts out appetite,'' 
::''as clothes cover the nude and'' 
::''as heaven clears up after a storm.''&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann: ''Ma'at. Gerechtigkeit und Unsterblichkeit im Alten Ägypten'' (= Beck'sche Reihe. Bd. 1403). 1. Auflage, Beck, München 1990, {{ISBN|3-406-45943-9}}. page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eyes of the Egyptians the world was always ambiguous; the actions and judgments of a king were thought to simplify these principles in order to keep Ma'at by separating order from chaos or good from evil.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann: ''Ma'at. Gerechtigkeit und Unsterblichkeit um Alten Ägypten'' (= ''Beck'sche Reihe.'' Bd. 1403). 1. Auflage, Beck, München 1990, {{ISBN|3-406-45943-9}}. page 58, 59 &amp; 213–216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anja Berendine Kootz: ''Der altägyptische Staat: Untersuchung aus politikwissenschaftlicher Sicht'' (= ''Menes.'' Band 4). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2006, {{ISBN|3447053194}}. page 71–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DBR&gt;Donald B. Redford: ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt: A-F'' (= ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'', volume 1). Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|019513821X}}, page 485.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karenga (Maulana.): ''Maat, The Moral Ideal in Ancient Egypt: A Study in Classical African Ethics''. Routledge, London 2003, {{ISBN|0415947537}}, page 363.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coffin Texts|Coffin Text]] 335a asserts the necessity of the dead being cleansed of Isfet in order to be reborn in the [[Duat]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabinovich, Yakov. ''Isle of Fire: A Tour of the Egyptian Further World''. Invisible Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isfet is thought to be the product of an individual's free will rather than a primordial state of chaos. In mythology, this is represented by [[Apep]] being born from [[Ra]]'s [[umbilical cord]] relatively late.&lt;ref&gt;Kemboly, Mpay. 2010. The Question of Evil in Ancient Egypt. London: Golden House Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also believed that the physical representation of Isfet was through the god, Seth&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson,
 Toby. The Egyptian World. (New York: Routeledge Worlds, 2013). {{ISBN|9781136753763}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Role of the King==
When the king made public appearances he was surrounded by images of foreigners which emphasized his role as protector of Ma'at and the enemy of Isfet which were foreign enemies of Ancient Egypt. As such, the king is mainly shown 'smiting' foreigners to maintain Ma'at&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Toby. ''The Egyptian World''. (New York: Routeledge Worlds, 2013). {{ISBN|9781136753763}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The king also maintained the Temple Cult to prevent Isfet from spreading by ensuring the cults were performed at defined intervals which were necessary in preserving the balance of Ma'at against the threatening forces of Isfet&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Toby. ''The Egyptian World''. (New York: Routeledge Worlds,
 2013). {{ISBN|9781136753763}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
Islam arrived in Malawi with the [[Arab]] and [[Swahili people|Swahili]] traders who traded in ivory, gold and later on slaves beginning from 16th century to the 19th century. It is also argued that Islam first arrived in Malawi through traders from the [[Kilwa Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arne S. Steinforth|title=Troubled Minds: On the Cultural Construction of Mental Disorder and Normality in Southern Malawi|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783631587171|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Muslim teachers, Shayhks Abdallah Mkwanda and Sabiti Ngaunje, also played an important role in the spread of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Owen J. M. Kalinga|title=Historical Dictionary of Malawi|date=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780810859616|page=200|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UNESCO]], the first mosque was built by Swahili-Arab ivory traders.&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5603/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[History of Malawi#British rule|colonial era]], the authorities in the country feared that Islam posed the greatest threat, as an ideology of resistance, to their rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John McCracken|title=A History of Malawi, 1859-1966|date=2012|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|isbn=9781847010506|page=142|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was shared by Christian missionaries, who greatly feared that Islam could unite Africans in hostilities and uprisings against colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Owen J. M. Kalinga|title=Historical Dictionary of Malawi|date=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780810859616|page=201|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1970s witnessed the start of an Islamic revival among Muslims in Malawi, as well as among Muslims across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Klaus Fiedler|title=Conflicted Power in Malawian Christianity: Essays Missionary and Evangelical from Malawi|date=2015|publisher=Mzuni Press|isbn=9789990802498|page=202|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Muslim groups have engaged in [[Dawah|missionary work]] in Malawi. Much of this is performed by the [[African Muslim Agency]], based in [[Kuwait]]. The Kuwait-sponsored AMA has translated the [[Qur'an]] into [[Chichewa language|Chichewa]] (Cinyanja),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.org.za/mission%20reports_prayer/macedonian_call_Malawi.htm Proseletysation in Malawi]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the official languages of Malawi, and has engaged in other missionary work in the country.

==Demography==
A large number of Muslims in Malawi come from the [[Yao people (East Africa)|Yao people]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Brenner|editor1-first=Louis|title=Muslim Identity and Social Change in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=1993|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253312716|page=79|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are described as "the most important source of Islam in the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Timothy Insoll|title=The Archaeology of Islam in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521657020|page=393|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before their conversion to Islam, many Yao chiefs used Swahili Muslims as scribes and advisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=I.

[[Islam]] in [[South Ossetia]] is presented by migrants who work there, but not by the native Ossetians, unlike in North Ossetia - Alania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18269214|title=South Ossetia profile|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Islam started to spread in Ossetia in the 14th and 15th centuries. According to sources, mostly high noble families of Ossetian society received Muslim religion and peasants remained into the Christian faith.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

“In the 17th and 18th centuries, part of Ossetian people from [[Digor, Kars|Digor]] (under influence of [[Kabarday]]) received Islam religion. However, Islam was transpassed by christianity during the reign of the [[Russian Empire]] in Ossetia since 1801.&lt;ref&gt;[http://religiebi.info/index.php?a=main&amp;pid=89&amp;lang=eng Religious Identity of Ossetian People]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to Ruslan Bzargov:"In Ossetia Muslims never had more than 12-15% of the population"&lt;ref&gt;http://osetia.info/articles/2455/&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

== Demographics ==
Although there are no official censuses, estimates say that about 0.5% of the population of South Ossetia are Muslims. Officials also suspect that Russia's military and political actions will likely cause this percentage to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2074978/posts|title=Muslims Seen Moving into Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Changing Religious Balance in Both|date=September 3, 2008|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{reliable|date=September 2017}}

{{Jewish outreach}}
'''Jews for Judaism''' is an international organization that focuses on preventing [[Jews]] from [[Religious conversion|convert]]ing to other faiths and reclaiming those who have already converted. It provides counseling services, education, and outreach programs to all [[Jewish denominations]]. It was established in 1985 by Rabbi [[Bentzion Kravitz]].&lt;ref name= corp/&gt;

The name Jews for Judaism was developed from "[[Jews for Jesus]]", one of the principal missionary organizations it was founded to counteract. One of its prominent early members, Larry Levey, was a Jewish convert to Christianity who then converted back to Judaism and led the Baltimore office of Jews for Judaism for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Brzozowski, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-03-04/news/8801140524_1_messianic-jews-jews-and-christians-bible-stories "Former Convert Fights Christians Who Convert Jews"], ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'', March 04, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Hoffman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fOcCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 "Inside Jews for Jesus"], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', April 28, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its activities in response to Christian missionaries, Jews for Judaism has also been noted for its critiques of the [[Kabbalah Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Tugend, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/fraud_arrest_at_kabbalah_centre_20051111/ "Fraud Arrest at Kabbalah Centre"], ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'', November 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaby Wenig, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/against_the_stream_20020726/ "Against the Stream"], ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'', July 25, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadya Labi, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,987398-1,00.html "What Profits the Kabbalah?"], ''[[TIME]]'', November 24, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offices==
Jews for Judaism has three international offices located in: [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], United States; [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada; and [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewsforjudaism.org/centers/ Worldwide Centers], Jews for Judaism website, accessed November 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Be-True"==
Jews for Judaism formed the student organization, "Be-True", as a response to missionary activity on university campuses. The organization runs primarily through student representative volunteers. There are currently "Be-True" representatives in the United States, Canada, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centers - Jews for Judaism|url=http://www.be-true.org/centers/|website=be-true.org|publisher=Be-True, Jews for Judaism|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jews for Judaism forums==
Jews for Judaism Forums served as a home for many observant Jews, [[Noahide Laws|Noahides]], practicing Jews, non-practicing Jews, and [[Conversion to Judaism|converts]]. The forums discussed issues pertaining to interfaith couples, and helped inquisitive minds answer their questions about Judaism. Additionally, there were frequent debates on the site between the members and visiting [[Evangelism|Evangelists]]. In 2007, Jews for Judaism decided to shut down the forum.

'''Knight of Swords''' is a card used in Latin suited playing cards which include [[tarot|tarot decks]]. It is part of what [[tarot reading|tarot card readers]] call the "[[Minor Arcana]]".

Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}

==Symbolism==
According to [[Arthur Edward Waite|Waite]], he is described as riding in full course, as if scattering his enemies.&lt;ref name="pkt"&gt;''[[wikisource:The Pictorial Key to the Tarot#Knight of Swords|The Pictorial Key to the Tarot]]'', by [[Arthur Edward Waite|Arthur Waite]]&lt;/ref&gt; This fits well, as Waite associates it, among other things, with [[war]] and [[wrath]].&lt;ref name="pkt"/&gt;

==Interpretation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
The Knight of Swords is often taken to represent a confident and articulate young man, who may act impetuously. The problem is that this Knight, though visionary, is unrealistic.  He fights bravely, but foolishly.  In some illustrations, he is shown to have forgotten his armor or his helmet.  A 'rush to war' is a possibility with this warrior.  When played "reversed", the Knight of Swords could represent a clever liar, secrets, or a sly and deceitful confidence trickster.  A reversed Knight of Swords is also a warning that an intended path would be a terrible mistake, or more precisely, that reconsidering your actions would be a wise decision.

'''''Kol HaAm''''' ({{lang-he|קול העם}}, lit. "Voice of the People") was a Hebrew-language newspaper in [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] and [[Israel]], owned by the [[Maki (historical political party)|Israeli Communist Party]].

==History==
Established in 1937, the paper appointed Communist Party member [[Esther Vilenska]] editor in 1943, and chief editor in 1947. Vilenska's second husband, Zvi Breidstein, was also an editor of the paper.

In 1953 ''Kol HaAm'' and its Arabic-language sister newspaper [[Al-Ittihad (Israeli newspaper)|Al-Ittihad]] published a controversial article on the [[Korean War]], which resulted in the [[Internal Affairs Minister of Israel|Minister of Internal Affairs]] [[Israel Rokach]], ordering the paper to close for 15 days. The papers filed a petition to the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]], which ruled that the suspension had been wrongly issued and should be set aside.&lt;ref name=YS&gt;Schmidt, Y (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=51gNA4Go_lUC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=kol+ha-am&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MTUUuhNznv&amp;sig=__9GJEyI6Vxv54fQFcfgj15CWAg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KNMTSrS1NorLjAeosomzBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA126,M1 ''Foundations of Civil and Political Rights in Israel and the Occupied Territories''], GRIN Verlag, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling had utilised the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|declaration of independence]] in making its judgement on the issue of free speech, the first time the declaration had been used as an instrument for interpretation.&lt;ref name=YS/&gt; What became known as the "Kol HaAm decision" also set the precedent that newspapers could only be shut down if it was an "almost certain" danger to national security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=4612 "Government orders closure of Arab weekly"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030170853/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=4612 |date=2007-10-30 }}, Reporters Without Borders, 24 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper ceased publication in 1975.

Līlāśuka probably at King Kulaśekhara’s court (c.900 A.D.) wrote this popular lyric on [[Krishna]] as the sexually precocious infant loved by all women but interpreted as symbolising God attracting all souls, thus an early example of [[Vaishnava]] devotional [[kāvya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Classical Age|author=R.K.Pruthi|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|page=204|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=g3cEERlSo4wC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=Lilasuka&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HgUjU8HFIsmUrAfJq4CYCg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Lilasuka&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work exists in two recensions, the southern and the western&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dictionary of Indian Literature: Beginnings|author=Sujit Mukherjee|publisher=Orient Blackswan|page=189|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YCJrUfVtZxoC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Lilasuka&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0wcjU_7QIoKmrQeXiYCgCw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Lilasuka&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the canonical text of the [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnavas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Literature 500-1399|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=231|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BC3l1AbPM8sC&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=Lilasuka&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HwkjU8enMIWRrAeH5YGwAg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Lilasuka&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
  
''Kṛśṇa-karaṇāmṛta'' is a devotional anthology of mediaeval lyric and passionate stanzas in ''śārdūlavikrīdita'' metre in honour of Krishna. It is a favourite and authoritative eulogistic work, familiar among gesture-dancers. The earliest firm date of this work is about 1367 in Gangādevi’s ''Madhurā-vijaya'', but the date of the author is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Literature Vol.2|author=Jan Gonda|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|pages=30–31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efFcarIuo58C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Lilasuka&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2twiU6HEN8GkrQfnrYHQDQ&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lilasuka&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sanskrit]] poetry of Lilasuka and [[Jayadeva]] (author of ''[[Gita Govinda]])'', created a new aesthetics of ''[[bhakti]]'', based on a revaluation of the literary category of ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' by elaborating the vocabulary of ''[[kama]]'' and ''[[Love|prema]]'' creatively mingling erotic love and devotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Love’s Subtle magic|author=Aditya Behl|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=67|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PK7riKO6IN8C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Lilasuka&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2twiU6HEN8GkrQfnrYHQDQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lilasuka&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is deep mysticism in the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Survey of Sanskrit Literature 1962 Ed.|author= C.

Lilasuka probably hailed from a southern part of India as is indicated by the metre used by him, but it is not established whether this poem was written by Bilavamangala, the noted grammarian of the 12th or 13th century, or by Bilavamangala who lived in the 9th century.

Lu was born in Shangsui (now [[Chenzhou]]), and was related to the prefecture's magistrate, Lu Guan. At the age of 17, he met a wandering Daoist and learned various talismanic and shamanic arts. In 1120, he had a vision in which he was shown the location of a secret manuscript of the [[Shangqing School]] by a student of [[Zhang Daoling]]; this manuscript would later form the basis of Lu's main treatise ''The Great Method of the Jade Hall of the Three Heavens of the Supreme Mysterious Origin'' ({{zh|Wushang xuanyuan santian yutang dafa|t=無上玄元三天玉堂大法}}).

[[File:Manjuvajramandala con 43 divinità - Unknown - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Thangka]] painting of Manjuvajra mandala]]

A '''mandala''' (emphasis on first syllable; [[Sanskrit]] मण्डल, maṇḍala – literally "circle") is a spiritual and ritual [[symbol]] in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], representing the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;{{cite web | title = mandala | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mandala | year = 2008 | publisher = Merriam–Webster Online Dictionary | accessdate = 2008-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In common use, "mandala" has become a generic term for any diagram, chart or geometric pattern that represents the [[cosmos]] metaphysically or symbolically; a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] of the [[universe]].

The basic form of most mandalas is a square with four gates containing a circle with a [[Bindu (symbol)|center point]]. Each gate is in the general shape of a T.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kheper.net/topics/Buddhism/mandala.html Kheper,''The Buddhist Mandala – Sacred Geometry and Art'']&lt;/ref&gt; Mandalas often have radial [[Formal balance|balance]].&lt;ref name=SaylorIntroPDF&gt;{{cite web|last=www.sbctc.edu (adapted)|title=Module 4: The Artistic Principles|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-4.pdf|publisher=Saylor.org|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appears in the [[Rigveda]] as the name of the sections of the work, and [[Vedic rituals]] use mandalas such as the [[Navagraha]] mandala to this day. Mandalas are also used in Buddhism.

In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of practitioners and adepts, as a spiritual guidance tool, for establishing a [[temenos|sacred space]] and as an aid to [[meditation]] and [[trance]] induction.

==Hinduism==
[[File:Vishnu Mandala.jpg|thumb|Mandala of [[Vishnu]]]]

===Religious meaning===
A ''[[yantra]]'' is similar to a mandala, usually smaller and using a more limited colour palette. It may be a two- or three-dimensional geometric composition used in ''[[sadhana]]s'', puja or meditative rituals, and may incorporate a [[mantra]] into its design. It is considered to represent the abode of the deity. Each ''yantra'' is unique and calls the deity into the presence of the practitioner through the elaborate symbolic geometric designs. According to one scholar, "Yantras function as revelatory symbols of cosmic truths and as instructional charts of the spiritual aspect of human experience"&lt;ref&gt;[[Madhu Khanna|Khanna Madhu]], ''Yantra: The Tantric Symbol of Cosmic Unity''. Thames and Hudson, 1979, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many situate ''yantras'' as central focus points for Hindu tantric practice. ''Yantras'' are not representations, but are lived, experiential, [[Nondualism|nondual]] realities. As Khanna describes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite its cosmic meanings a ''yantra'' is a reality lived. Because of the relationship that exists in the [[Tantra]]s between the outer world (the macrocosm) and man's inner world (the microcosm), every symbol in a ''yantra'' is ambivalently resonant in inner–outer synthesis, and is associated with the subtle body and aspects of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, Madhu, ''Yantra: The Tantric Symbol of Cosmic Unity''. Thames and Hudson, 1979, pp. 12-22&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Political meaning===
{{main|Mandala (political model)}}
The ''[[Rajamandala]]'' (or ''Raja-mandala''; circle of states) was formulated by the [[India]]n author [[Kautilya]] in his work on politics, the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' (written between 4th century BCE and 2nd century BCE). It describes circles of friendly and enemy states surrounding the king's state.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Prof. Mahendra Prasad (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=80q_hd7ASdEC Indian Political Thought: Themes and Thinkers]''. Pearson Education India. {{ISBN|8131758516}}. pp. 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In historical, social and political sense, the term "mandala" is also employed to denote traditional Southeast Asian political formations (such as federation of kingdoms or vassalized states). It was adopted by 20th century Western historians from ancient Indian political discourse as a means of avoiding the term 'state' in the conventional sense. Not only did Southeast Asian polities not conform to Chinese and European views of a territorially defined state with fixed borders and a bureaucratic apparatus, but they diverged considerably in the opposite direction: the polity was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Vajrayana===
{{Main|Vajrayana}}
In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, mandalas have been developed also into [[sandpainting]]. They are also a key part of [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]] meditation practices.

====Visualisation of Vajrayana teachings====
The mandala can be shown to represent in visual form the core essence of the [[Vajrayana]] teachings. The mind is "a microcosm representing various divine powers at work in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SghdYBbMds0C&amp;pg=PA343 |title=Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs: The New Age Movement |author=John Ankerberg, John Weldon |page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mandala represents the nature of the Pure Land, Enlightened mind.

An example of this type of mandala is [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/37614 ''Vajrabhairava mandala''] a silk tapestry woven with gilded paper depicting lavish elements like crowns and jewelry, which gives a three-dimensional effect to the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vajrabhairava Mandala|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/37614|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watt|first1=James C.Y.|title=When Silk was Gold: Central Asian and Chinese Textiles|date=1997|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|page=95|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/When_Silk_Was_Gold_Central_Asian_and_Chinese_Textiles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mount Meru=====
A mandala can also represent the entire universe, which is traditionally depicted with [[Mount Meru]] as the [[axis mundi]] in the center, surrounded by the continents.&lt;ref&gt;Mipham (2000) pp. 65,80&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/39738 ''Cosmological Mandala with Mount Meru''], a [[silk]] [[tapestry]] from the [[Yuan dynasty]] that serves as a diagram of the Tibetan cosmology, which was given to China from Nepal and Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmological Mandala with Mount Meru|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/39738|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watt|first1=James C.Y.|title=The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty|date=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New York|page=247|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/The_World_of_Khubilai_Khan_Chinese_Art_in_the_Yuan_Dynasty#|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wisdom and impermanence=====
In the mandala, the outer circle of fire usually symbolises wisdom. The ring of eight [[charnel ground]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdcu.org.au/scw/thanka.html |title=A Monograph on a Vajrayogini Thanka Painting |date=13 August 2003 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030813002533/http://www.bdcu.org.au/scw/thanka.html |archivedate=13 August 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; represents the [[Buddhist]] exhortation to be always mindful of death, and the impermanence with which ''[[samsara]]'' is suffused: "such locations were utilized in order to confront and to realize the transient nature of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/charnel_g.html|title=Charnel- and Cremation Grounds|first=Rufus C.|last=Camphausen|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described elsewhere: "within a flaming rainbow nimbus and encircled by a black ring of [[dorje]]s, the major outer ring depicts the eight great charnel grounds, to emphasize the dangerous nature of human life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sootze.com/tibet/mandala.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303134523/http://www.sootze.com/tibet/mandala.htm |archivedate=2006-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside these rings lie the walls of the mandala palace itself, specifically a place populated by deities and [[Buddha (general)|Buddhas]].

=====Five Buddhas=====
One well-known type of mandala is the mandala of the "Five Buddhas", archetypal Buddha forms embodying various aspects of enlightenment. Such Buddhas are depicted depending on the school of [[Buddhism]], and even the specific purpose of the mandala. A common mandala of this type is that of the [[Five Wisdom Buddhas]] (a.k.a. Five ''[[Jinas]]''), the Buddhas [[Vairocana]], [[Aksobhya]], [[Ratnasambhava]], [[Amitabha]] and [[Amoghasiddhi]]. When paired with another mandala depicting the [[Five Wisdom Kings]], this forms the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]].

====Practice====
[[File:Painted 19th century Tibetan mandala of the Naropa tradition, Vajrayogini stands in the center of two crossed red triangles, Rubin Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Tantric mandala of [[Vajrayogini]]]]
Mandalas are commonly used by tantric Buddhists as an aid to meditation.

The mandala is "a support for the meditating person",&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; something to be repeatedly contemplated to the point of saturation, such that the image of the mandala becomes fully internalised in even the minutest detail and can then be summoned and contemplated at will as a clear and vivid visualized image. With every mandala comes what Tucci calls "its associated liturgy ... contained in texts known as [[tantras]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianart.com/mandalas/tibet.html|title=The Mandala in Tibet|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; instructing practitioners on how the mandala should be drawn, built and visualised, and indicating the [[mantra]]s to be recited during its ritual use.

By visualizing "pure lands", one learns to understand experience ''itself'' as pure, and as the abode of enlightenment. The protection that we need, in this view, is from our own minds, as much as from external sources of confusion. In many tantric mandalas, this aspect of separation and protection from the outer samsaric world is depicted by "the four outer circles: the purifying fire of wisdom, the [[vajra]] circle, the circle with the eight tombs, the lotus circle".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jyh.dk/indengl.htm|title=Mandala|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ring of ''vajras'' forms a connected fence-like arrangement running around the perimeter of the outer mandala circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jyh.dk/indengl.htm#Circles|title=Mandala|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a meditation on impermanence (a central teaching of [[Buddhism]]), after days or weeks of creating the intricate pattern of a [[sand mandala]], the sand is brushed together into a pile and spilled into a body of running water to spread the blessings of the mandala.

[[Per Kvaerne|Kværne]]&lt;ref&gt;Per Kvaerne 1975: p.&amp;nbsp;164&lt;/ref&gt; in his extended discussion of [[sahaja]], discusses the relationship of [[sadhana]] interiority and exteriority in relation to mandala thus:
{{quote|...external ritual and internal sadhana form an indistinguishable whole, and this unity finds its most pregnant expression in the form of the mandala, the sacred enclosure consisting of concentric squares and circles drawn on the ground and representing that adamant plane of being on which the aspirant to Buddha hood wishes to establish himself. The unfolding of the tantric ritual depends on the mandala; and where a material mandala is not employed, the adept proceeds to construct one mentally in the course of his meditation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kvaerne|first= Per |year=1975|title= On the Concept of Sahaja in Indian Buddhist Tantric Literature.

====Offerings====
[[File:Chenrezig Sand Mandala.jpg|thumb|[[Chenrezig]] [[sand mandala]] created at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] on the occasion of the [[Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama's]] visit in May 2008]]

A "mandala offering"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/tantra/buddhist-tantra/what-is-a-mandala|title=What Is a Mandala?|website=studybuddhism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is a symbolic offering of the entire universe. Every intricate detail of these mandalas is fixed in the tradition and has specific symbolic meanings, often on more than one level.

Whereas the above mandala represents the pure surroundings of a Buddha, this mandala represents the universe. This type of mandala is used for the mandala-offerings, during which one symbolically offers the universe to the Buddhas or to one's teacher. Within Vajrayana practice, 1,000,000 of these mandala offerings (to create merit) can be part of the preliminary practices before a student even begins actual tantric practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thubtenchodron.org/PrayersAndPractices/preliminary_practice.htm|title=Preliminary practice (ngöndro) overview|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mandala is generally structured according to the model of the universe as taught in a Buddhist classic text the ''[[Abhidharmakosha|Abhidharma-kośa]]'', with [[Mount Meru]] at the centre, surrounded by the continents, oceans and mountains, etc.

===Shingon Buddhism===
One Japanese branch of Mahayana Buddhism—[[Shingon]] Buddhism—makes frequent use of mandalas in its rituals as well, though the actual mandalas differ. When Shingon's founder, [[Kukai]], returned from his training in China, he brought back two mandalas that became central to Shingon ritual: the [[Womb Realm|Mandala of the Womb Realm]] and the [[Diamond Realm|Mandala of the Diamond Realm]].

These two mandalas are engaged in the ''[[abhiseka]]'' initiation rituals for new Shingon students, more commonly known as the ''Kechien Kanjō'' (結縁灌頂). A common feature of this ritual is to blindfold the new initiate and to have them throw a flower upon either mandala. Where the flower lands assists in the determination of which [[yidam|tutelary deity]] the initiate should follow.

[[Sand mandala]]s, as found in Tibetan Buddhism, are not practiced in Shingon Buddhism.

=== Nichiren Buddhism ===
The mandala in [[Nichiren Buddhism]] is called a ''moji-mandala'' (文字曼陀羅) and is a paper [[hanging scroll]] or wooden tablet whose inscription consists of [[kanji|Chinese characters]] and [[Siddhaṃ script|medieval-Sanskrit script]] representing elements of the Buddha's [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], protective Buddhist deities, and certain Buddhist concepts. Called the ''[[Gohonzon]]'', it was originally inscribed by [[Nichiren]], the founder of this branch of [[Japanese Buddhism]], during the late 13th Century. The ''Gohonzon'' is the primary object of veneration in some Nichiren schools and the only one in others, which consider it to be the supreme object of worship as the embodiment of the supreme [[Dharma]] and Nichiren's inner enlightenment. The seven characters [[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō]], considered to be the name of the supreme Dharma, as well as the [[invocation]] that believers chant, are written down the center of all Nichiren-sect ''Gohonzons'', whose appearance may otherwise vary depending on the particular school and other factors.

===Pure Land Buddhism===
Mandalas have sometimes been used in [[Pure Land Buddhism]] to graphically represent [[Pure Land]]s, based on descriptions found in the ''[[Larger Sutra]]'' and the ''[[Contemplation Sutra]]''. The most famous mandala in Japan is the [[Taima mandala]], dated to about 763 CE. The Taima mandala is based on the ''Contemplation Sutra'', but other similar mandalas have been made subsequently. Unlike mandalas used in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, it is not used as an object of meditation or for esoteric ritual. Instead, it provides a visual representation of the Pure Land texts, and is used as a teaching aid.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Also in [[Jodo Shinshu]] Buddhism, [[Shinran]] and his descendant, [[Rennyo]], sought a way to create easily accessible objects of reverence for the lower-classes of Japanese society. Shinran designed a mandala using a hanging scroll, and the words of the ''[[nembutsu]]'' (南無阿彌陀佛) written vertically. This style of mandala is still used by some [[Jodo Shinshu]] Buddhists in home altars, or ''[[butsudan]]''.

==Mesoamerican civilizations==
===Mayan ''Tzolk'in''===
[[File:Mayan_Compass_2.jpg|thumb|right|Mayan ''[[Tzolk'in]]'' wheel from 498 AD.]]
One of several parallels between Eastern and [[Mesoamerican]] cultures, the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] civilization tended to present calendars in a mandala form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frontiers-of-anthropology.blogspot.com/2012/01/mayan-mandala.html Frontiers of Anthropology — The Mayan Mandala]&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar in form and function to the ''[[Kalachakra]]'' (Wheel of Time) sand paintings of Tibetan Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.human-resonance.org/maya.html Mandalas of the Maya: Celestial Waters and the Auroral Plumes of Tláloc]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tzolk'in'' wheel has 260 segments, surprising because the Mayans recognized that the calendar year is 365 days long. The inclusion of the specific number 260 could however relate to the 26,000 year cycle of the precession of the equinoxes. If so, this would indicate a remarkable awareness of these great cycles of time by this culture. Ultimately, the symbol was probably used for ritual purposes, and to measure the interval of a number of 9-month intervals like pregnancy, the cultivation time of some crops, and rituals that were performed at a 260-day spacing each year, for example, spring and fall.

This Mayan symbology has even made its way into [[New Age]] symbolism as the [[Dreamspell]] calendar, developed by [[José Argüelles]]. Sometimes described as an authentic Mayan mandala, it is "inspired by" elements of the ''Tzolk'in'' wheel of time.

===Aztec Sun Stone===
[[File:Aztec_calendar_on_Amate.jpg|thumb|right|The Aztec Sun Stone as an [[amate]] print.]]
The [[Aztec calendar stone|Sun Stone]] of the Aztec civilization was once believed to be their equivalent of a Tzolk'in calendar, but is now thought to be a ceremonial representation of the entire universe as seen by the Aztec religious class.

The earliest interpretations of the stone relate to its use as a calendar. In 1792, two years after the stone's unearthing, Mexican anthropologist [[Antonio de León y Gama]] wrote a treatise on the Aztec calendar using the stone as its basis.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio de León y Gama: ''Descripción histórica y cronológica de las dos piedras'' [http://memory.loc.gov/service/rbc/rbc0001/2006/2006kislak2/2006kislak2.pdf León y Gama]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the circles of [[glyph]]s are the glyphs for the days of the month.&lt;ref name="colonial_latin_america_p23"&gt;K. Mills, W. B. Taylor &amp; S. L. Graham (eds), ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History'', 'The Aztec Stone of the Five Eras', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The four symbols included in the Ollin glyph represent the four past suns that the Mexica believed the earth had passed through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=State and Cosmos in the Art of Tenochtitlan|last=Townsend|first=Casey|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|year=1979|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the stone is its religious significance. One theory is that the face at the center of the stone represents [[Tonatiuh]], the Aztec deity of the sun. It is for this reason that the stone became known as the "Sun Stone." Richard Townsend proposed a different theory, claiming that the figure at the center of the stone represents [[Tlaltecuhtli]], the Mexica earth deity who features in Mexica creation myths.&lt;ref name="colonial_latin_america_p23" /&gt; Modern archaeologists, such as those at the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|National Anthropology Museum]] in Mexico City, believe it is more likely to have been used primarily as a ceremonial basin or ritual altar for [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|gladiatorial sacrifices]] than as an astrological or astronomical reference.&lt;ref name="getty.edu"&gt;[https://www.getty.edu/research/exhibitions_events/exhibitions/obsidian_mirror/aztec_calendar_stone.html Getty Museum, "Aztec Calendar Stone"] ''getty.edu'', accessed 22 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another characteristic of the stone is its possible geographic significance. The four points may relate to the four corners of the earth or the cardinal points. The inner circles may express space as well as time.&lt;ref&gt;K. Mills, W. B. Taylor &amp; S. L. Graham (eds), ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History'', 'The Aztec Stone of the Five Eras', pp. 23, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, there is the political aspect of the stone. It may have been intended to show [[Tenochtitlan]] as the center of the world and therefore, as the center of authority.&lt;ref&gt;K. Mills, W. B. Taylor &amp; S. L. Graham (eds), ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History'', 'The Aztec Stone of the Five Eras', pp. 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend argues for this idea, claiming that the small glyphs of additional dates amongst the four previous suns—1 Flint (''Tecpatl''), 1 Rain (''Atl''), and 7 Monkey (''Ozomahtli'')—represent matters of historical importance to the Mexica state. He posits, for example, that 7 Monkey represents the significant day for the cult of a community within ''Tenochtitlan''. His claim is further supported by the presence of Mexica ruler [[Moctezuma II]]'s name on the work. These elements ground the Stone's iconography in history rather than myth and the legitimacy of the state in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912811300|title=State and cosmos in the art of Tenochtitlan|last=Townsend|first=Richard Fraser|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University|year=|isbn=9780884020837|location=|pages=|oclc=912811300|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
[[File:Marsh-chapel-window.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rose window|round window]] at the site of the [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]] supervised by [[Walter Pahnke]]]]
Forms which are evocative of mandalas are prevalent in Christianity: the [[celtic cross]]; the [[rosary]]; the [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]; the [[aureole]]; [[oculus|oculi]]; the [[Crown of Thorns]]; [[rose window]]s; the [[Rosy Cross]]; and the [[dromenon]] on the floor of [[Chartres Cathedral]]. The dromenon represents a journey from the outer world to the inner sacred centre where the Divine is found.&lt;ref&gt;See David Fontana: "Meditating with Mandalas", p. 11, 54, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cosmati]] [[Pavement (architecture)|pavement]]s, including that at [[Westminster Abbey]], are geometric mandala-like [[mosaic]] designs from thirteenth century Italy. The Great Pavement at Westminster Abbey is believed to embody divine and cosmic geometries as the seat of enthronement of the monarchs of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/conservation/video-library|title=Cosmati Pavement - Video Library|website=www.westminster-abbey.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, many of the Illuminations of [[Hildegard von Bingen]] can be used as mandalas, as well as many of the images of [[esoteric Christianity]], as in [[Christian]] [[Hermeticism]], [[Christian]] [[Alchemy]], and [[Rosicrucianism]].

Alchemist, Mathematician and Astrologer [[John Dee]] developed a geometric symbol which he called the ''[[Sigillum Dei]]'' 'Seal of God' manifesting a universal geometric order which incorporated the names of the [[archangels]], derived from earlier forms of the ''clavicula salomonis'' or [[key of Solomon]].
[[File:Sloane3188-john dee.png|thumb|right|The Seal of God; a mystic [[pentagram]] symbol composed by Dee]]
[[The Layer Monument]], an early 17th-century marble mural funerary monument at the [[Church of Saint John the Baptist, Maddermarket, Norwich]], is a rare example of Christian iconography absorbing alchemical symbolism to create a mandala in Western funerary art.

== Mandalas in Persian art ==
In Persian Islamic theosophy, each of us is a part of God. We have been separated from our source like the rays of the sun and, we need to always keep in our mind that we have a divine light in us, which is the source of love. This light always shows us the right path to grow and find our way back to our source.

Therefore in Persian Shamseh motif which symbolizes the sun, there is a center which is the symbol of god or the source of energy. This small circle is surrounded by many other circles or polygons with the same center but in different sizes. These circles are the light rays of the sun which symbolize every god’s creature. Every creature tends to reach God, so the purpose of life is to reach back the source of energy which is mentioned as pure love in some references. Some of us are closer to our origin, while some of us have a long journey to reach it. As in Shamseh, some circles are smaller, therefore, closer to the center.

Shamseh motif was wildly applied during Safavid time in Iran. Safavid was one of the most important ruling dynasties of Iran in art, architecture, astrology, philosophy, and theosophy. An extraordinary example of Shamseh motif would be the tiling of the ceiling of Sheik Lotfollah mosque in Isfahan. Persian "Shamseh" motif painted on a copper plate. The art of hand painting and enameling is called "Meenakari" in Farsi.]]

==Western psychological interpretations==
According to art therapist and mental health counselor Susanne F. Fincher, we owe the re-introduction of mandalas into modern Western thought to [[Carl Jung]], the Swiss analytical psychologist. In his pioneering exploration of the unconscious through his own art making, Jung observed the motif of the circle spontaneously appearing. The circle drawings reflected his inner state at that moment. Familiarity with the philosophical writings of India prompted Jung to adopt the word "mandala" to describe these circle drawings he and his patients made. In his autobiography, Jung wrote:
{{quote|I sketched every morning in a notebook a small circular drawing, ... which seemed to correspond to my inner situation at the time. ... Only gradually did I discover what the mandala really is: ... the Self, the wholeness of the personality, which if all goes well is harmonious.|Carl Jung|''[[Memories, Dreams, Reflections]]'', pp. 195–196.}}

Jung recognized that the urge to make mandalas emerges during moments of intense personal growth. Their appearance indicates a profound re-balancing process is underway in the psyche. The result of the process is a more complex and better integrated personality.
{{quote|The mandala serves a conservative purpose—namely, to restore a previously existing order. But it also serves the creative purpose of giving expression and form to something that does not yet exist, something new and unique. ... The process is that of the ascending spiral, which grows upward while simultaneously returning again and again to the same point.|Jungian analyst [[Marie-Louise von Franz]]|C. G. Jung: ''[[Man and His Symbols]]'', p. 225}}

Creating mandalas helps stabilize, integrate, and re-order inner life.&lt;ref&gt;see Susanne F. Fincher: ''Creating Mandalas: For Insight, Healing, and Self-Expression'', pp. 1 - 18&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the psychologist [[David Fontana]], its symbolic nature can help one "to access progressively deeper levels of the unconscious, ultimately assisting the meditator to experience a mystical sense of oneness with the ultimate unity from which the cosmos in all its manifold forms arises."&lt;ref&gt;See David Fontana: ''Meditating with Mandalas'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==In archaeology==
One of the most intense archaeological discoveries in recent years that could redefine the history of eastern thought and tradition of mandala is the discovery of five giant mandalas in the valley of [[Manipur]] made with Google Earth imagery. Located in the paddy field in the west of [[Imphal]], the capital of Manipur, the Maklang geoglyph is perhaps the world’s largest mandala built entirely of mud. The site wasn’t discovered until 2013 as its whole structure could only be visible via Google Earth satellite imagery. The whole paddy field, locally known as [[Bihu Loukon]], is now protected and announced as historical monument and site by the government of Manipur in the same year.  The site is situated 12&amp;nbsp;km aerial distance from [[Kangla]] with the GPS coordinates of 24° 48' N and 93° 49' E. It covers a total area of around 224,161.45 square meters. This square mandala has four similar protruding rectangular ‘gates’  in the cardinal directions guarded each by similar but smaller rectangular ‘gates’ on the left and right. Within the square there is an eight petalled flower or rayed-star, recently called as Maklang ‘Star fort’ by the locals, in the centre covering a total area of around 50,836.66 square meters. The discovery of other five giant mandalas in the valley of Manipur is also made with Google Earth.  The five giant mandalas, viz., Sekmai mandala, Heikakmapal mandala, Phurju twin mandalas and Sangolmang mandala are located on the western bank of the Iril River.&lt;ref&gt;Wangam, Somorjit (2018).

==In architecture==
[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|right|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a Mandala]]
[[Buddhist architecture]] often applied mandala as the blueprint or plan to design Buddhist structures, including [[Buddhist temple|temple complex]] and stupas. A notable example of mandala in architecture is the 9th century [[Borobudur]] in Central Java, Indonesia. It is built as a large [[stupa]] surrounded by smaller ones arranged on terraces formed as a [[stepped pyramid]], and when viewed from above, takes the form of a giant [[Vajrayana|tantric Buddhist]] mandala, simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology and the nature of mind.&lt;ref name="Wayman"&gt;{{cite conference|author=A. Wayman| title=Reflections on the Theory of Barabudur as a Mandala| booktitle=Barabudur History and Significance of a Buddhist Monument| publisher=Asian Humanities Press| location=Berkeley| year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other temples from the same period also has mandala plan, including [[Sewu]], [[Plaosan]] and [[Prambanan]]. The similar mandala plan design are also observable in Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar.

==In science==
[[File:Hexapoda phylogenetic tree.png|thumb|Phylogenetic tree of [[Hexapoda]] (insects and their six-legged relatives).

Circular diagrams are often used in [[phylogenetics]], especially for the graphical representation of phylogenetic relationships. [[Phylogenetic tree|Evolutionary trees]] often encompass numerous species that are conveniently shown on a circular tree, with images of the species shown on the periphery of a tree. Such diagrams have been called phylogenetic mandalas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==In contemporary use==
Mandalas can be found in early [[Buddhist]] art from the [[14th century|14th]] and [[15th century|15th centuries]].

Fashion designer [[Mandali Mendrilla]] designed an interactive art installation called Mandala of Desires (Blue Lotus Wish Tree) made in peace silk and eco friendly textile ink, displayed at the [[China Art Museum]] in Shanghai in November 2015. The pattern of the dress was based on the Goloka Yantra mandala, shaped as a lotus with eight petals. Visitors were invited to place a wish on the sculpture dress, which will be taken to India and offered to a genuine living [[Wish Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://formsofdevotion.org/china-art-museum-in-shanghai/|title=China Art Museum in Shanghai - Forms of Devotion|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wall.hr/fashion/izlozena-haljina-mandali-mendrile-hit-je-izlozbe-u-najvecem-kineskom-muzeju/|title=Haljinu "Mandala of Desires" dnevno posjećuje čak 30 000 ljudi!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marion H. Skidmore Library is the largest [[private library]] specializing in [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]], [[New Thought]], and [[psychic]] research materials and rare books. It serves in-depth researchers at the undergraduate through the doctoral level studies as well as lecturers, academic scholars, and authors. It is supported through tax-deductible contributions, and its work is furthered by the efforts of the Lily Dale Assembly, Inc.

== History ==
The following words were written in 1899 by William P. Bach, the publisher of the ''Sunflower'', a newspaper published in [[Lily Dale]], New York, from 1898 through 1909.&lt;blockquote&gt;“THE LIBRARY was founded in 1886 and on account of the active interest taken in it by her; it was called the “Marion Skidmore Library.” During the fourteen years of its existence it has been continually added to.  The association has continually made appropriations in its behalf, entertainments have been given for its benefit and hundreds of volumes have been donated by friends.  It now comprises between twelve and thirteen hundred bound volumes, besides magazines, papers, etc., not bound.  It has many rare books, including bound volumes of some of the earliest Spiritualist newspapers.  It is located in Library Hall and is always in charge of a competent librarian."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Current information about the Marion H. Skidmore Library ==
Two videos are show daily. According to the official webpage, these are:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“''Village of Spirits''” – A video about the history of [[Lily Dale]] and its evolution into a place of pilgrimage, growth, and reflection for the modern Spiritualist community, shown at 11:30 am daily in the meeting room downstairs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“''Lily Dale: A Place of Harmony and Reflection''” – A short video featuring images of the Lily Dale grounds, shown at 2:00 pm daily in the meeting room downstairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Marion H.

A '''mendicant''' (from {{lang-la|mendicans}}, "begging") is one who practices '''mendicancy''' ([[begging]]) and relies chiefly or exclusively on [[Charity (practice)|charitable donations]] to survive. In principle, [[Mendicant orders|mendicant religious orders]] do not own property, either individually or collectively, and members have taken a [[vow of poverty]], in order that all their time and energy could be expended on practicing or preaching and serving the poor. It is a form of [[asceticism]].

Many religious orders adhere to a mendicant way of life, including the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] mendicant orders, [[Hindu ascetic]]s, some [[Sufi]] [[dervishes]] of [[Islam]], and the [[monastic]] orders of [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]. In the [[Catholic Church]], followers of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] and [[Saint Dominic]] became known as mendicants, as they would beg for food while they preached to the villages.

While mendicants are the original type of monks in Buddhism and have a long history in Indian Hinduism and the countries which adapted Indian religious traditions, they didn't become widespread in Christianity until the [[High Middle Ages]]. ''[[The Way of a Pilgrim]]'' depicts the life of an [[Eastern Christian]] mendicant.

The '''mental body''' (the [[mind]]) is one of the [[Subtle body|subtle bodies]] in [[esoteric]] philosophies, in some [[religious]] teachings and in [[New Age]] thought.  It is understood as a sort of body made up of [[thought]]s, just as the [[emotional body]] consists of [[emotions]] and the [[Human anatomy|physical body]] is made up of [[matter]].  In [[Occultism|occult]] understanding, thoughts are not just subjective [[qualia]], but have an existence apart from the associated physical organ, the [[Brain#Mind and brain|brain]].

==Theosophical and New Age conceptions==

According to Theosophists [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C.W. Leadbeater]] &lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C. W., ''Man, Visible and Invisible'', 1902&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Annie Besant]] &lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie, ''Man and His Bodies'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar School of Theosophy]]), and later [[Alice Bailey]], the mental body is equivalent to the "Lower Manas" of [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|Blavatsky]]'s original [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven principles of man]].&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H.P., ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'', 1889&lt;/ref&gt; But the New Age writer [[Barbara Brennan]] describes the Mental body as intermediate between the Emotional and the Astral body in terms of the layers in the "Human Energy Field" or Aura.&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, Barbara Ann, ''Hands of Light : A Guide to Healing Through the Human Energy Field ([http://www.kheper.net/topics/subtlebody/BAB-mental.htm Mental body])'', Bantam Books, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

The mental body is usually considered in terms of an aura that includes [[thoughtform]]s.  In Theosophical and Alice Bailey's teachings, it corresponds to the [[Mental plane]].

==The mind in the Western Wisdom Teachings==

According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings,&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''The Rosicrucian Mysteries (Chapter IV: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rms/rmseng02.htm#Chapter_IV The Constitution of Man: Vital Body - Desire Body - Mind])'', 1911, {{ISBN|0-911274-86-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the mind is the latest acquisition of the human [[soul|spirit]] and is related to the ''[[Region of Concrete Thought]]'', which is the lower region of the [[Mental plane|World of Thought]]. It is not yet an organized body and in most people it is still a mere inchoate cloud disposed particularly in the region of the head. It works as the link or focus between the ''threefold'' Spirit and the ''threefold'' body [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen005.gif], in a reversed reflexion manner [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen001.gif]: the mind is like the projecting lens of a stereopticon, it projects the image in one of three directions, according to the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] of the thinker, which ensouls the [[thoughtform|thought-form]].

His writings, called [[Western Wisdom Teachings]], give a clear description on how the man's inner Spirit perceives, from the [[Mental plane|world of thought]], the [[Plane (cosmology)|lower worlds]] through the mind: " We ourselves, as Egos, function directly in the subtle substance of the Region of Abstract Thought, which we have specialized within the periphery of our individual aura. Thence we view the impressions made by the outer world upon the vital body through the senses, together with the feelings and emotions generated by them in the desire body, and mirrored in the mind. From these mental images we form our conclusions, in the substance of the Region of Abstract Thought, concerning the subjects with which they deal. Those conclusions are ideas. By the power of will we project an idea through the mind, where it takes concrete shape as a thought-form by drawing mind-stuff around itself from the Region of Concrete Thought. ".&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]] (Chapter III: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcc/rcceng03.htm#part2 Man and the Method of Evolution])'', 1909, {{ISBN|0-911274-34-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also states that to the trained [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] there appears to be an empty space in the center of the forehead just above and between the eyebrows and it looks like the blue part of a gas flame, but not even the most gifted seer can penetrate that veil, also known as "THE VEIL OF ISIS".

==Samael Aun Weor==
[[Samael Aun Weor]] stated that only those who have worked consciously to do so have created a mental body. A "solar mind" or "solar mental body" is the quality of mind of a true human, yet, it is stated that this humanity is not composed of true humans, but rather intellectual animals: beings with a mind of an animal, but reasoning superior to that of other animals. According to Samael Aun Weor, the qualifications to being a real human being is identical to the lowest requirements of being a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. The process of acquiring the mind of a human in this sense involves the psychological death of the "I" (desire) and the work of practical [[sex magic#Samael_Aun_Weor|sexual alchemy]].&lt;ref name="3factors"&gt;{{cite web|last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=Three Factors of the Revolution of the Consciousness | url=http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/308/65/ |accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; More explicitly stated, the title of Buddha is achieved through the Fourth Initiation of Major Mysteries, when the fourth serpent of fire or [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]] has risen.&lt;ref name="fourthserpent"&gt;{{cite web |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=Jesus' Fourth Serpent |url=http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/490/10142/ |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319034636/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/490/10142/ |archivedate=2007-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The intellectual animal does not have a Mental Body, but he possesses a subtle, lunar, intellectual animal vehicle, which is very similar to the Mental Body, but of a cold and ghost-like nature.&lt;ref name="3factors" /&gt;}}

Whether the lunar or solar aspect, the mental body is stated to exist within the 5th dimension and is represented by [[Netzach]]. With the mental body one can travel through the [[Mental plane|mental world]], the world of thoughts and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=Man and the Universe That Surrounds Him |url=http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/141/64/ |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703044135/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/141/64/ |archivedate=2007-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Esoteric Christianity]], the mental body is represented by the stubborn yet useful donkey that the Savior (Christ) subdues in order to be used as a vehicle to enter into heavenly Jerusalem (the superior worlds).&lt;ref name="fourthserpent" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1880">'''Paul Komor''' was a Hungarian businessman and diplomat.

He had lived in [[Shanghai]] since 1898, and had been involved in relief work as trustee of the Komor Charity Fund and chairman and treasurer of the Hungarian Relief Fund since 1924. Komor held the title of Honorary Consul General for Hungary in Shanghai in 1938-1941. He co-founded the International Committee for the Organization of European Refugees in China (I.C.), which was established in August 1938 and financed primarily by [[Victor Sassoon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport23.html Péter Vámos, ''The Life of Central European Jewish Refugees in Shanghai During World War II''. Pacific Rim Report No. 23, November 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626102631/http://www.pacificrim.usfca.edu/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport23.html |date=2010-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The IC provided housing, jobs and financial assistance for the 18,000 German, Austrian and other refugees who came into Shanghai. The IC also issued [[international passport]]s to the Jews of Shanghai whose Nazi passports were confiscated or no longer valid. Stateless refugees received identification cards signed by Paul Komor. These documents were accepted by the Shanghai Municipal Council as well as the Japanese authorities, and even by some foreign countries, such as Australia.  These passports gave the refugees "legal" status so they could emigrate to the United States, Canada, Australia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vcn.bc.ca/alpha/Diplomats.htm Diplomats Who Saved Jews]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney''' ({{lang-la|Administratio Apostolica Personalis Sancti Ioannis Mariae Vianney}}) was established on 18 January 2002 by [[Pope John Paul II]] for [[traditionalist Catholic]] clergy and laity within the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Campos|Diocese of Campos]] in [[Brazil]]. It is the only Personal Apostolic Administration in existence, and the only [[Catholic Church]] jurisdiction devoted exclusively to celebrating the pre-1970 form of the [[Roman Rite]]. Its current Apostolic Administrator is Bishop [[Fernando Arêas Rifan]].

From 3 January 1949 to 29 August 1981, the Diocese of Campos was headed by Bishop [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]], who opposed the use there of [[Pope Paul VI]]'s [[Mass of Paul VI|revision]] of the [[Roman Missal]] and held to the [[Tridentine Mass]]. After his resignation, the then 77-year-old Bishop Castro Mayer continued to lead opposition in the diocese to the revised liturgy and on 30 June 1988 joined with Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] in [[Ecône Consecrations|consecrating]] as [[bishop]]s, against an express prohibition by Pope John Paul II, four [[priest]]s of the [[Society of St. Pius X]]. For this action he was declared to have incurred excommunication.

The priests of Campos who shared his traditionalist Catholic views formed themselves into the Priestly Union of [[John Vianney|Saint Jean-Marie Vianney]], also known as the Sacerdotal Society of St. John Marie Vianney (SSJV) and, when Bishop de Castro Mayer died in April 1991, chose as his successor [[Licínio Rangel]], who was given episcopal consecration later that year by three bishops of the [[Society of St. Pius X]].

==Reconciliation with the Holy See==
Together with the [[Society of Saint Pius X]], the Campos group of priests made a pilgrimage to Rome during the Jubilee Year 2000 and was welcomed by Cardinal [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos]], President of the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei]], with a lunch and dialogue.&lt;ref name="http://www.zenit.org/article-3435?l=english"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130416084542/http://www.zenit.org/article-3435?l=english Traditionalist Schism in Brazil Ends]&lt;/ref&gt; They decided to seek reconciliation with the [[Holy See]] and, on 15 August 2001, wrote a letter to Pope John Paul II in which the..." whole Union renewed the profession of Catholic faith, declaring full communion with the Chair of Peter, recognising 'his Primacy and the government of the universal Church, her pastors and her faithful', and likewise declaring: 'For no reason do we wish to be separated from the Rock (Peter) on which Jesus Christ founded his Church".
&lt;ref name="LetterJP22RANGEL"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_20020119_mons-rangel_en.html Quotation from Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas Day (25 December), 2001, Pope John Paul II responded with an [[autograph letter]] telling the priests that, "warmly consenting to your request to be received into the full communion of the Catholic Church, we canonically recognise that you belong to her." The Pope also removed the excommunication of Bishop Rangel for his illicit episcopal ordination.&lt;ref name="LetterJP22RANGEL" /&gt;

When the necessary legislation had been drawn up, the Pope then established for the Campos group, with effect from 18 January 2002, the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney, with authority over those Catholics in the Diocese of Campos who wished to use the [[Roman Rite]] in the form it had before the revisions following the [[Second Vatican Council]]. 

On the date of entry into effect of the new arrangement, a ceremony was held in Campos, to "sign the letter of entrance into full ecclesial communion of the priests of Campos from the Priestly Union of Saint John Mary Vianney and of the Catholic faithful they minister to, being then thus considered perfectly inserted in the Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic Church."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspx.org/District_Superiors_Ltrs/2002_ds_ltrs/reconciliation_in_campos.htm SSPX: Regarding the "reconciliation" in Campos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013232930/http://www.sspx.org/District_Superiors_Ltrs/2002_ds_ltrs/reconciliation_in_campos.htm |date=2006-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent history==
[[File:Brasão de Dom Antônio de Castro Mayer.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Coat of Mayer, carved in a wooden door in the Church of "Our Lady of Aparecida and St. Fidelis", belonging to the Apostolic Administration.]]

During the 1980s and 1990s, some claimed that followers of the Priestly Union of Saint Jean-Marie Vianney constituted the majority of the Catholics of Campos, who had never known the revised Liturgy of the Mass, as their diocesan bishop [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]] had, during the 1970s, retained the [[Tridentine Mass]] in his territory. However, when at the end of 2003 separate statistics were, for the first time, gathered for the Diocese of Campos and the new personal apostolic administration, the latter reported 28,325 Catholics, 28 priests, 9 seminarians, 75 religious sisters and 24 schools, while the diocese reported 854,000 Catholics, 48 diocesan and 17 religious priests, 30 seminarians, 19 religious brothers and 67 religious sisters, and 5 schools (''Annuario Pontificio'' 2005). The corresponding figures seven years later were, for the personal apostolic administration, 30,733 Catholics, 32 priests, 7 seminarians, 38 religious sisters and 24 schools,  and for the diocese 940,000 Catholics, 69 diocesan and 16 religious priests, 27 seminarians, 18 religious brothers and 81 religious sisters and 18 schools.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio'' 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his letter of 25 December 2001, Pope John Paul II promised to ensure the episcopal succession of Bishop Licínio Rangel, and when Bishop Rangel asked that he be given an auxiliary bishop, recommended him to ask instead for a coadjutor, who would have the automatic right of succession. The Pope then, on 28 June 2002, appointed to that post Bishop Rangel's vicar general, [[Fernando Arêas Rifan]], who automatically succeeded Bishop Rangel as [[Apostolic Administrator]], when the latter died on 16 December 2002.

[[File:Igreja Principal de Campos.JPG|190px|thumb|Main church at Campos, 2012]]

A group of [[traditionalist Catholics]] was thus accommodated fully within the [[Catholic Church]]. They accept the authority of the Pope as Vicar of Christ and Shepherd of the Church, the legitimacy of the [[Second Vatican Council]] and the validity of the Mass approved by Pope Paul VI. The clergy of the [[apostolic administration]] possess the faculty to celebrate in [[Latin language|Latin]] the Mass, the sacraments and all other [[sacrament]]al rites in the form codified by [[Pope Pius V|Saint Pius V]] and modified by his successors down to [[Pope John XXIII|Saint John XXIII]].

==Doctrinal stance==
In his first pastoral letter to the clergy, religious, associations and other faithful of the Apostolic Administration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adapostolica.org/modules/articles/article.php?id=84 original text (in Portuguese)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192604/http://www.adapostolica.org/modules/articles/article.php?id=84 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Rifan stressed the importance of the papal mandate or canonical mission given to him, quoting the [[Council of Trent]]'s anathema against any who would say that one who lacks it is a lawful preacher of the word of God and minister of the sacraments.

He also warned those to whom he addressed his pastoral letter against two errors. One is heresy, attacks against the traditional Faith. He saw as a defence against that the traditional Latin liturgy and liturgical discipline that the Apostolic Administration keeps. The other error is schism, attacks against the unity of governance of the Church. Members of the Apostolic Administration must be on their guard against this too, he said, especially since their rightful efforts to preserve the Catholic faith had some unfortunate effects, in particular the onset of "a certain schismatic spirit that showed itself in a general taste for systematic criticism of Church authorities, a spirit of resistance, disobedience, disrespect, suspicion, backbiting, independence from the Church's Hierarchy and Magisterium, contentment with the abnormality of the situation, uncharitableness, a feeling of owning the whole of truth, a sectarian attitude that made us out to be the only good people ... with the underlying notion that 'the gates of Hell' had prevailed against the Church - something that, through the infallible help of our Saviour, is impossible."

[[File:Trono do Bispo da Igreja Principal de Campos.JPG|thumb|170px|left|Throne Episcopal Church's current Principal of Campos. The Apostolic Administrator is simultaneously Bishop, so he can use all of the episcopal insignias.]]

The document in Portuguese [https://web.archive.org/web/20070313021743/http://www.adapostolica.org/modules/articles/article.php?id=129 ''Answers to 48 questions on our recognition by the Holy See''] explains in details the reasons for the priests' decision to seek reconciliation with the Holy See and for their disagreement with the attitude, in this matter, of the Society of St Pius X.

In a 2005 interview, Cardinal Castrillón stated that there were cordial relations between the Personal Apostolic Administration and the Diocese of Campos at all levels, and that priests of the Apostolic Administration were celebrating Mass in the older form for the traditionalist faithful in another dozen dioceses in Brazil in accordance with signed agreements that they had with the diocesan bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=9360 |title=Rapprochement by unhasty stages, but not too slow either |access-date=2006-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008130208/http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=9360 |archive-date=2006-10-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ras il-Wardija''' is a promontory in the limits of [[San Lawrenz]], on the southwest coast of [[Gozo]], [[Malta]]. It contains the remains of a [[Punic-Roman towers in Malta|Punic-Roman]] sanctuary, which was excavated by Italian archaeologists in the 1960s. The area is privately owned and it is currently in a dilapidated state.

==The site==
Ras il-Wardija was probably first inhabited in the [[Bronze Age]], in around 1500 BC. In around the 3rd century BC,&lt;ref name="nicpmi"/&gt; during the [[Ancient Carthage|Punic]] period, a religious complex (probably a [[nymphaeum]]) was established in the area. Since the site is clearly visible from the sea, it might have also served as a [[beacon]] for ships travelling between the [[Maltese islands|Maltese Islands]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name="culturalheritage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ras il-Wardija – the return of the lost graffito|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/Ir-Ritorn%20tal-Graffit%20Mitluf%20-%20Press%20Release%20June%202011%20-%20Maltese%20&amp;%20English%20Version%20-%20Text%20Version.pdf|website=Superintendence of Cultural Heritage|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603211605/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/Ir-Ritorn%20tal-Graffit%20Mitluf%20-%20Press%20Release%20June%202011%20-%20Maltese%20%26%20English%20Version%20-%20Text%20Version.pdf|archivedate=3 June 2016|date=3 June 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site remained in use throughout the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period. Carved crosses on the walls suggest that the site eventually became a [[Christian]] place of worship.&lt;ref name="culturalheritage"/&gt; The site remained in use until around the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="nicpmi"/&gt; A hermitage might have existed in the area during the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bugeja|first1=Lino|title=Gozo – a historical and scenic cornucopia|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160110/life-features/Gozo-a-historical-and-scenic-cornucopia.598303|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=10 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603213226/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160110/life-features/Gozo-a-historical-and-scenic-cornucopia.598303|archivedate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main structural elements of the site are:
*a rock-hewn rectangular chamber, with a number of niches in the walls
*a T-shaped rock-hewn corridor leading to the chamber
*a water reservoir and a bell-shaped well, both rock-hewn
*the remains of an external masonry structure including an altar
The masonry structure has some similarities to the remains of the Punic-Roman sanctuary at [[Tas-Silġ]] in [[Marsaxlokk]].&lt;ref name="culturalheritage"/&gt;

==Excavations and recent history==
The area around Ras il-Wardija was used for defensive purposes during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="culturalheritage"/&gt; The site was first excavated by the Missione Archaeologica Italiana a Malta (Archaeological Mission of Malta) between 1964 and 1967.&lt;ref name="nicpmi"/&gt; The temple was well preserved until the excavations, but it has since deteriorated.&lt;ref name="independent2015-05-25"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barry|first1=Duncan|title=Sanctuary advertised on Visit Gozo site but owner of land where temple stands has 'reservations'|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-25/local-news/Sanctuary-advertised-on-Visit-Gozo-site-but-owner-of-land-where-temple-stands-has-some-reservations-6736136053|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=25 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811231811/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2015-05-25/local-news/Sanctuary-advertised-on-Visit-Gozo-site-but-owner-of-land-where-temple-stands-has-some-reservations-6736136053|archivedate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 1988, it was discovered that an ancient graffito carved on one of the walls of the sanctuary had been stolen. The graffito shows a human figure with outstretched arms, in the shape of a cross. It has been suggested that the figure represents the Punic goddess [[Tanit]], but it might also be a medieval representation of a Christian cross. The graffito was recovered in June 2011, and it is now on display at the [[Gozo Museum of Archaeology]] in the [[Cittadella (Gozo)|Cittadella]].&lt;ref name="culturalheritage"/&gt;

The land on which the sanctuary is located is privately owned by George Spiteri, and permission may be required in order to access the site.&lt;ref name="independent2015-05-25"/&gt; It is listed on the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands]].&lt;ref name="nicpmi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ras il-Wardija|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/00002.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501165648/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/00002.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2016|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acropolis Roquepertuse''' is a historical religious center for the [[Celts]]. It is located near the city of [[Velaux]], north of [[Marseille]] and west of [[Aix-en-Provence]], in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] [[région]] of southern France. Roquepertuse had no domiciles available for worshippers and has been used as a sanctuary where only priests may have lived permanently. It was destroyed by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in 124 BC and was discovered in 1860. Most of the [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] were done in 1923 by [[Henri de Gérin-Ricard]].

==Findings==
{{prose|section|date=March 2015}}
[[File:Roquepertuse. Statue de guerrier.jpg|thumb|250px|Seated warrior from Roquepertuse]]

Officially, the findings have been dated to the 3rd century BC. This age has been established based on [[Celt]]ic expansion into the area, which took place around the same time. However, the clothing and gestures of certain [[statue]]s found at the site suggest that they date from the 5th or 6th century BC, instead. These statues are distinguished by their unique seated position, comparable to the upright and cross-legged seated position found in statues depicting the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].

# A platform of 50 m by 22 m paved with flat stones including a couple of reused headstones, divided in the middle by a staircase made of large blocks of stone. Stone walls to the left and to the right of the stairs formed a terrace, probably one of several which had originally belonged to the complex.
# On the platform was what is variously called a portal, or door frame, or portico with pillars, of limestone. Its columns had cavities in which human stone masks, as well as human skulls, had been placed. Its lintel was carved with the heads of four horses, and additional decoration in paint. At the top of the lintel was a limestone statue of a bird of 60&amp;nbsp;cm by 60&amp;nbsp;cm which has been called a goose, but is now thought more likely to be a raptor.
# A dualfaced, androgynous sculpture of limestone (0.2 m high and 30&amp;nbsp;cm long).
# Two statues of a figure in a seated Buddha-like position (0.62 m high).

The first interpretations of archaeologists was that this was a secluded sanctuary. The latest findings, from various multidisciplinary studies, suggest that it was an agglomeration of about 0.5 hectares with a sanctuary to the north, as well as a bulwark of protection.

The site is important in part because it provides evidence for the Celtic "head cult" described in Greek and Roman accounts.

The site is near to another Celtic-Roman site at [[Entremont (oppidum)|Entremont]], which had similar relief sculpture of severed human and horse heads, as well as skull niches carved into pillars. Also see [[Oppidum|Oppidium]] for other nearby archaeological sites of approximately the same historical period.

'''''Sayyid''''' (also spelt '''Syed''', '''Saiyed''', '''Seyit''', '''Seyd''', '''Said''', '''Sayed''', '''Sayyed''', '''Saiyid''', '''Seyed''' and '''Seyyed''') ({{lang-ar|سيد}} {{IPA-ar|ˈsæj.jɪd|}}, {{IPA-fa|sejˈjed|lang}}; meaning "[[Mr.|Mister]]"; plural {{lang|ar|سادة}} {{transl|ar|''sādah''}}) is an [[honorific]] title denoting people ({{transl|ar|ALA|sayyidah}} {{lang|ar|سيدة}} for females) accepted as descendants of the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] and his cousin [[Ali|Imam Ali]] through his grandsons, [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]] (combined [[Hasnain]]),&lt;ref name="365 days with Sahabah"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parwej |first1=Mohammad Khalid |title=365 days with Sahabah |date=2015 |publisher=Goodword Books |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rwhkBgAAQBAJ&amp;q=Hasnain |accessdate=4 July 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}} sons of Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]] and son-in-law [[Ali]] (Ali ibn Abi Talib).&lt;ref name="The graves of Tarim genealogy and mobility across the Indian Ocean"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ho |first1=Engseng |title=The graves of Tarim genealogy and mobility across the Indian Ocean |date=2006 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0-520-93869-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YMcZU0VHdG0C |accessdate=25 August 2016 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|149}}

Female ''sayyids'' are given the titles ''Sayyida'', ''Syeda'', ''Alawiyah'' or ''Sharifa''. In some regions of the [[Islamic world]], such as in India, the descendants of Muhammad are given the title ''[[Emir|Amir]]'' or Mir, meaning ''commander'', ''general'' (please note '''Amir''' is also a name commonly used, as is any variant of ''Sayyid'' or ''Sayyida''). The descendents of the Islamic Prophet Muhammed honour the possession of family trees tracing back their ancestry. In other regions, they are called '' Shah''. Children of a Sayyida mother but a non-Sayyid father are referred to as [[Mirza]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.naqvis.com/art/titles.htm Titles of Sayyids Written by Al- Sayyid Sadiq Al- Hossaini Al- Eshkevari.

In the [[Arab world]], ''sayyid'' is the equivalent of the English word "[[Homage (feudal)|liege lord]]" or "master" when referring to a descendant of Muhammad, as in ''Sayyid Ali Sultan.''&lt;ref name="A History of the Modern Middle East"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cleveland |first1=William L. |last2=Bunton |first2=Martin |title=A History of the Modern Middle East |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-8133-4980-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_JMDAAAQBAJ |accessdate=25 August 2016 |language=English |date=2 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215025228/https://books.google.com/books?id=2_JMDAAAQBAJ |archivedate=15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[sidi]]'' (from the contracted form ''sayyidī'', 'my liege'){{clarify|date=August 2016}}&lt;!--Of what words is sayyidi contracted?--&gt; is often used in Arabic.&lt;ref name="People of India by Herbert Risely"&gt;People of India by Herbert Risely&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not verified, many Arabic language experts state that it has its roots in the word ''Al Asad'' {{lang|ar|الأسد}}, meaning ''lion'', probably because of the qualities of valour and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hitchcock |first1=Richard |title=Muslim Spain Reconsidered |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=9780748678310 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l-IkDQAAQBAJ |accessdate=28 April 2017 |language=en |date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|158}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corriente |first1=Federico |title=Dictionary of Arabic and Allied Loanwords: Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Galician and Kindred Dialects |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9004168583 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N_hAzIqriakC |accessdate=28 April 2017 |language=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006153300/http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N_hAzIqriakC |archivedate=6 October 2014  |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|265}}

Although reliable statistics are unavailable, conservative estimates put the number of Sayyids in the tens of millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last = Morimoto |editor1-first = Kazuo |title=Sayyids and Sharifs in Muslim Societies: The Living Links to the Prophet |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-51917-5 |pages=2, 11 |edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sayyids are by definition a branch of the [[Banu Hashim]],  that traces its lineage to [[Adnan]] and therefore it is directly descended from [[Ishmael]] ([[Ishmael in Islam|Ismâ`îl]]), as well as being collaterally descended from his paternal half brother [[Isaac]] ([[Isaac in Islam|Isha'aq]]), the sons of [[Abraham]] ([[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]]).

Banū Hāshim (Arabic: بنو هاشم) is the clan of  prophet Muhammad ; his great-grandfather was Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, for whom the clan is named. Members of this clan are referred to as Hashemites. Descendants of Muhammed usually carry the titles Sayyid, Syed, [[Hashmi]], Sayed and Sharif, or the Ashraf clan (synonymous to Ahl al-Bayt).
Today, two sovereign monarchs – Abdullah II of Jordan and Muhammad VI of Morocco – and the erstwhile royal family of Libya are also considered to be a part of Banu Hashim.

The [[Hashemites]] (Arabic: الهاشميون, Al-Hāshimīyūn; also House of Hashim) are the ruling royal family of Jordan. The House was also the royal family of Syria (1920), Hejaz (1916–1925) and Iraq (1921–1958). The family belongs to the Dhawu Awn, one of the branches of the Hasanid Sharifs of Mecca – also referred to as Hashemites – who ruled Mecca continuously from the 10th century until its conquest by the House of Saud in 1924. Their eponymous ancestor is Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.

Traditionally, [[Islam]] has had a rich history of the veneration of [[relics]], especially of those attributed to the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Goldziher, I. and Boer, Tj. de, “At̲h̲ar”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P.

== Indication of descent ==
In the early period, the Arabs used the term ''Sayyid'' and ''[[Sharif]]'' to denote descendants from both [[Hassan (surname)|Hasan]] and [[Imam Hussain|Husayn]]. However, in the modern era, the term 'Sharif' (''Sharifah'' for females) has been used to denote descendants from Hasan, and the term 'Sayyid' (''Sayyidah'', ''Syeda'' for females) has been used to denote descendants from Husayn.&lt;ref name="Khanam"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q_189OeDwSMC&amp;pg=PA724 Encyclopaedic Ethnography of Middle-East and Central Asia: A-I, Volume 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610105543/https://books.google.com/books?id=q_189OeDwSMC&amp;pg=PA724 |date=10 June 2016 }} edited by R.

'''Note''': (For non-Arabic speakers) When transliterating Arabic words into English there are two approaches.
* 1. The user may transliterate the word letter for letter, e.g., "الزيدي" becomes "a-l-z-ai-d-i".
* 2. The user may transcribe the pronunciation of the word, e.g., "الزيدي" becomes "a-zz-ai-d-i". This is because in Arabic grammar, some consonants (''n, r, s, sh, t'' and ''z'') cancel the ''l'' (ل) from the word "the" ''al'' (ال) (see [[sun and moon letters]]). When the user sees the prefixes ''an'', ''ar'', ''as'', ''ash'', ''at'', ''az'', etc... this means the word is the transcription of the pronunciation.
* An ''i'', ''wi'' (Arabic), or ''vi'' (Persian) ending could perhaps be translated by the English suffixes ''-ite'' or ''-ian''. The suffix transforms a personal name or place name into the name of a group of people connected by lineage or place of birth. Hence ''Ahmad al-Hassani'' could be translated as ''Ahmad, the descendant of Hassan'', and ''Ahmad al-Manami'' as ''Ahmad from the city of Manami''. For further explanation, see [[Arabic name]]s.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Also, El-Husseini, Al-Husseini, Husseini, and Hussaini.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Those who use the term ''Sayyid'' for all descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib regard [[Alawi (name)|Allawis]] or Alavis as Sayyids. However, Allawis are not descendants of Muhammad, as they are descended from the children of Ali and the women he married after the death of Fatima, such as [[Umm ul-Banin]] (Fatima bint Hizam). Those who limit the term ''Sayyid'' to descendants of Muhammad through Fatima,[[Allawi]]s/Alavis are the same how ''Sayyids''.

Some Sayyids also claim to be "''Najeeb Al Tarfayn''", meaning "Noble on both sides", which indicates that both of their parents are Sayyid. But in actuality this term is applied only to those Sayyids who have both [[Imam Hassan]] and [[Imam Hussain]] in their ancestry. These Sayyids, especially in the Arab world, would keep the prefix of ''Sayyid Alshareef'' or ''Shareefayn'', or ''Sayyidayn'' or ''Sheikh Assayyid'' before their names, followed by their father's and grandfather's names and then the clan's and tribe's names followed by ''AlHasani bil Hussaini'' or ''Al Hussaini bil Hasani'', depending on which Imam is patrilineal or matrilineal. Many Sayyids, especially in South Asia and Shia Sayyids, think that only the progeny of both Sayyid parents are called ''Najeeb Al Tarfayn'', but this idea may be attributed to a lack of knowledge in [[Arabic language]] and [[Genealogy]]. The importance of this concept of ''Najeeb AlTarfayn'' has its source in the [[Hadeeth]] of Muhammad wherein he stated that the [[Mahdi]], or "The Hidden One", would be ''Najeeb AlTarfayn'' from his lineage. Hence, Shia and Sunni Sayyids have different interpretations of this concept.In the Arab world Najeeb AlTarfayn Saadah would keep two white-colored daggers as opposed to just one by other Sayyids to demarcate their superiority amongst them. Hence their International [[coat of arms]] also shows two daggers.

== Existence of descendants of Hasan Al-Askari ==

The existence of any descendant of [[Hasan al Askari]] is disputed by many people. However, it is believed by [[Shia]] followers of the [[Twelve Imams]] that Hasan al-Askari had a son called [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who will be the redeemer of Islam. Genealogy trees of Middle Eastern and Central Asian families, mostly from Persia, Khorasan, Samarqand and Bukhara, show that Hasan al-Askari had also a second son called [[Sayyid Ali Akbar]]. It definitely indicates that al-Askari had children and it also substantiates the existence of [[Muhammad al Mahdi]]. Whether Al Askari had children or not is still disputed may be because of the political conflicts between the followers of the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imamah]] and the leadership of the [[Abbasids]] and [[Ghulat]] Shiites who do not believe in Hasan al-Askaris [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imamah]]. Another group of historians studying the pedigrees of some Central Asian saints' "shejere" (genealogy trees), believe that the Twelfth Imam was not the only son of Hasan al-Askari, and that the Eleventh Imam had two sons, Sayyid Muhammad (i.e., the Shia Mahdi) and Sayyid Ali Akbar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islam.az/modules/sections/index_op_viewarticle_artid_76.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414134445/http://www.islam.az/modules/sections/index_op_viewarticle_artid_76.html |archivedate=14 April 2012 |title=АХЛ аль-БЕЙТ, Имам Махди (да приблизит Аллах его пришествие!) : Ислам в Азербайджане (iSLAM.Az) |date=14 April 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; One descendant of Sayyid Ali Akbar was Saint Ishan (Eshon) Imlo of Bukhara.

In her book ''Pain and Grace: A Study of Two Mystical Writers of Eighteenth-Century Muslim India'', Dr.{{nbsp}}Annemarie Schimmel writes:

{{quote|Khwaja Mir Dard`s family, like many nobles, from Bukhara; led their pedigree back to Baha'uddin Naqshband, after whom the Naqshbandi order is named, and who was a descendant, in the 11th generation of the 11th Shia imam al-Hasan al-Askari.&lt;ref&gt;Dr.Annemarie Schimmels book «Pain and Grace: A Study of Two Mystical Writers of Eighteenth-Century Muslim India» BRILL, 1976, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Shiite historians generally reject the claim that Hasan al-Askari fathered children other than Muhammad al-Mahdi, the Shiite hadith book ''[[Kitab al-Kafi|Usul al-Kafi]]'', in [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni|Bab Mawlid Abi Muhammad al-Hasan]] b. 'Ali confirms the Sufi claim that Hasan al-Askari had more than one wife, in addition to slave girls, with whom he had relations. In his Usul, [[Kitab al-Kafi|al-Kafi]] writes:

== Middle East ==

Men belonging to the Sayyid families or tribes in the Arab world used to wear White or Ivory colored daggers like [[Jambiya]]s, [[Khanjar]]s or [[Shibriya]]s to demarcate their nobility amongst the other Arab men although this custom has been restricted due to the local laws of the variously divided Arab countries. Wearing [[Turban]]s of various colors especially white, black, green, yellow, orange or maroon is still done in its place and this practice has been followed more by the Non Arab Sayyids than Arabic speaking ones.

=== Iraq ===

The Sayyid families in Iraq are so numerous that there are books written especially to list the families and connect their trees. Some of these families are the Al-Nasrullah, Al-Wahab, [[Al-Hashimi]], Al-[[Quraishi]], [[Al-Obaidi]], Al-Yasiri, Al-Samarai, [[Zaidi (surname)|Al-Zaidi]], Al-A'araji, Al-[[Hassan (surname)|Hasani]], Al-[[Husseini|Hussaini]], Al-[[Shahristani]], Al-Qazwini Al-[[Qadri]], [[Tabatabaei]], Al-[[Alawites|Alawi]], Al-Ghawalib (Al-Ghalibi), [[Mousavi (surname)|Al-Musawi]], Al-Awadi (not to be confused with the Al-Awadhi [[Hola (ethnic group)|Huwala]] family), Al-Sabzewari, Al-Shubber, Al-Hayali, Al-Kamaludeen, Al Gharawi and some of the Al Kaabi and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MiSqRD9i1TgC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=Sayyids+in+Iraq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-JfJUIP8Hu2cmQXLpoHwDw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sayyids%20in%20Iraq&amp;f=false Reclaiming Iraq: The 1920 Revolution and the Founding of the Modern State] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430102412/https://books.google.com/books?id=MiSqRD9i1TgC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=Sayyids+in+Iraq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-JfJUIP8Hu2cmQXLpoHwDw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA |date=30 April 2016 }} By Abbas Kadhim&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iran ===

Sayyids (in {{lang-fa|سید}} ''seyyed'') are found in vast numbers in [[Iran]]. The Chief of “National Organization for Civil Registration” of Iran declared that more than 6 million of Iranians are Sayyid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13920211000043 Six million people of Iran’s population are Sadaat (Sayyid) / Tehran and Mazandaran (provinces) are the record owner of Sadaats in the country] farsnews.com 1 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Sayyids migrated to Iran from Arab lands predominantly in the 15th to 17th century during the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] era. The Safavids began transforming the religious landscape of Iran by imposing [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shiism]] on the populace. Since most of the population embraced Sunni Islam, and since an educated version of Shiism was scarce in Iran at the time, [[Ismail I|Ismail]] imported a new Shia ''[[Ulama]]'' corps who predominantly were Sayyids from traditional Shiite centers of the Arabic-speaking lands, such as [[Jabal Amel]] (of southern Lebanon), [[Syria]], [[Bahrain]], and [[southern Iraq]] in order to create a state clergy. The Safavids offered them land and money in return for loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Floor |first1=Willem |last2=Herzig |first2=Edmund |title=Iran and the World in the Safavid Age |date=2015 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-78076-990-5 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HZNpBgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=safavids+imported+lebanon |quote=In fact, at the start of the Safavid period Twelver Shi'ism was imported into Iran largely from Syria and Mount Lebanon (...) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903220359/https://books.google.com/books?id=HZNpBgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=safavids+imported+lebanon&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=3 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Islam pg.170"&gt;The failure of political Islam, by Olivier Roy, Carol Volk, pg.170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis Robinson pg.72"&gt;The Cambridge illustrated history of the Islamic world, by Francis Robinson, pg.72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marvin E.

During the reign of [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas the Great]], the Safavids also imported to Iran more Arab Shias, predominantly Sayyids, built religious institutions for them, including many ''[[Madrasa]]s'' (religious schools), and successfully persuaded them to participate in the government, which they had shunned in the past (following the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Hidden imam]] doctrine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-M3IRh22moC&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=sunni%20iran&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=300#v=onepage&amp;q=sunni%20iran&amp;f=false |title=Science Under Islam: Rise, Decline and Revival |first=Sayyed M. |last=Deen |date=1 January 2007 |publisher=Lulu.com |via=Google Books |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such titles in [[Oman]] are hereditary through paternal lineage or in some exceptional circumstances may be given as an honorary title by [[Royal Decree]].

=== Yemen ===

In Yemen the Sayyids are more generally known as ''sadah''; they are also referred to as ''[[Hashemite]]s''. In terms of religious practice they are [[Shia Islam|Shia]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], and [[Sufism|Sufi]]. Sayyid families in [[Yemen]] include the [[Rassids]], the Qasimids, the Mutawakkilites, the Hamideddins, some Al-Zaidi of [[Ma'rib]], Sana'a, and [[Sa'dah]], the [[Ba 'Alawi sada]] families in [[Hadhramaut]], Al-Wazir of [[Sana'a]], Al-Shammam of Sa'dah, the Sufyan of Juban, the Al-Jaylani of Juban, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4W3o6bUwCYEC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Sayyids+in+yemen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-pPJUPfFGcTPmAXej4DwDg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sayyids%20in%20yemen&amp;f=false A Tribal Order: Politics And Law in the Mountains of Yemen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617154108/https://books.google.com/books?id=4W3o6bUwCYEC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Sayyids+in+yemen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-pPJUPfFGcTPmAXej4DwDg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA |date=17 June 2016 }} By Shelagh Weir&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/526186/sayyid |title=sayyid – Arabic title |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122181035/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/526186/sayyid |archivedate=22 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ambassadors.net/archives/issue18/features3.htm From Religious Leaders to Ordinary Citizens The Changing Role of "Sadah" in Yemen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026110753/http://ambassadors.net/archives/issue18/features3.htm |date=26 October 2012 }} By Mohammed Al-Asadi&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libya ===

{{Further|List of Ashraf tribes in Libya}}
The Sayyids in Libya are Sunni, including the former royal family, which is [[Idrisid dynasty|originally Zaidi-Moroccan]] (also known as the [[Senussi]] family).&lt;ref&gt;[http://24dec1951.com/libya/the-senussi-family.html The Senussi family] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226195534/http://24dec1951.com/libya/the-senussi-family.html |date=26 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Add to that the El-Barassa Family are Ashraf as claimed by the sons of Abdulsalam ben Meshish, a descendant of Hassan bin Ali bin Abi Talib.

== South Asia ==

Although millions of people in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal claim Hashemite descent (Genealogy family trees 'Shajra' are looked into in identification of the authenticity of the claim to Hashemite descent).&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; In 1901 the total number of Sayyids in [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] was counted as 1,339,734.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Sayyid.aspx#1 "Sayyid."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227010410/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Sayyid.aspx |date=27 December 2013 }}, Sarwat Elahi, Encyclopedia of World Cultures. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent estimates show that in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal there are more than fifteen million Sayyids: eight million in [[Pakistan]], seven million in [[India]], over one million in [[Bangladesh]], and around seventy thousand in [[Nepal]].

=== History of South Asian sayyids ===
Sayyids migrated many centuries ago from different parts of the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]] ([[Turkestan]]), during the invasion of the [[Mongols]], and other periods of turmoil such as during the periods of the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]], [[Delhi Sultanate]], and [[Mughal Empire]], encompassing a timespan of roughly until the late 19th century. Sayyids migrated to [[Sindh]] and [[Uch]] in the north and settled there very early. Other early migrant Sayyids moved deep into the south, to the [[Deccan sultanates]] located in the [[Deccan Plateau]] region in the time of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], and later the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Qutb Shahi]] kings of [[Golkonda]], [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Nizam Shahi]] of [[Ahmednagar]], and other kingdoms of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]], [[Bidar Sultanate|Bidar]], and [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]]. Several visited India as merchants or escaped from the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]], [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]], and [[Ottoman Empire]]s. Their names figure in Indian history at the breakup of the Mughal Empire, when the [[Sayyid Brothers]] created and dethroned Emperors at their will (1714–1720). The first [[Muslim]]s appointed to the [[Council of India]] and the first appointed to the [[privy council]] were both Sayyids.&lt;ref name="Khanam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="navhindtimes"&gt;[http://www.navhindtimes.in/panorama/descendants-prophet-muhammad-india Descendants of Prophet Muhammad in India] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801093227/http://www.navhindtimes.in/panorama/descendants-prophet-muhammad-india |date=1 August 2013 }} By K D L Khan, Published on: 14 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="everyculture"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everyculture.com/South-Asia/Sayyid.html |title=Countries and Their Cultures, South Asia, Sayyid |publisher=Advameg, Inc. |first=Sarwat S |last=Elahi |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031102904/http://www.everyculture.com/South-Asia/Sayyid.html |archivedate=31 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Syeds]], wherever they went, were respected by local communities. Most of them were assigned religious duties by local leaders. When the Muslim conquest of South Asia began, [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Iran]]ian and [[Afghan]] Islamic forces from Central Asia also brought with them many Syed religious scholars who not only used to perform religious rites in the army but also preached Islam to the local population. Among them were the ancestors of modern-day [[Tirmizi]] and [[Naqvi al-Bukhari]] [[Syeds]].

During the entire period of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ascendancy in the [[Indian sub-continent]], the Mughals acknowledged [[Karlugh]]s as the rulers of [[Pakhli sarkar]]. In addition, probably due to their common [[Central Asian]] origin, Mughals never levied taxes on the state of Pakhli Sarkar. Sultan Maqarrab revolted against his own brother [[Sultan Mehmud Khurd]], but was defeated by the Sultan due to intervention from the [[Delhi Sultanate]] under the command of Syed Jalal Tirmizi Baba the grandson of Pir Baba. In honor [[Sultan Mehmud Khurd]] marry his daughter to Syed Jalal Baba in 1701. Around 1713 [[Sultan Mehmud Khurd]] went to [[Delhi]]; in his absence Shamsher Khan, a general of Sultan Khurd, revolted against the Mughals, citing increased interference on the part of the Mughal Empire at the Jhanjal fort of [[Thakot]]. This revolt was successfully put down after a siege of several months by Syed Jalal Baba, and their allies, the [[Yousafzai]]s, defeated Shamsher Khan, who was killed in battle and [[Sultan Khurd]] imprisoned by [[Syed Hussain Ali Khan Barha]] in Delhi until his death. [[Syed Hussain Ali Khan Barha]], the cousin of Syed Jalal Baba, who were both powerful [[Mughal Army]] generals of the Mughal Empire during the early 18th century. The [[Sayyid Brothers]] became highly influential in the [[Mughal Court]] after [[Aurangzeb]]'s death and became kingmakers during the anarchy following the death of [[Emperor Aurangzeb]] in 1707. They created and dethroned Mughal Emperors at their will during the 1710s. Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha was fatally poisoned in 1722.

Another main fight was fought between the Hindus and Sikhs of Shamdhara and Syed Jalal Baba troops in the [[Agror Valley]] ([[Shamdhara]] was a great centre of business run by [[Hindu]] Baniyas as like [[Qissa Khawani Bazaar]] [[Peshawer]] and was located on [[Silk road]] to [[China]]). Syed Jalal Baba issued an ultimatum to either accept Islam or be ready for battle. The Hindus and Sikhs chose battle, so Syed Jalal sent his brother, Pir Imam Tirmizi (the grandson of Pir Baba), along with Yosafzai's troops, to capture the Agror Valley. A bloody battle started among Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims at the place of [[Shamdhara]] named "Kundiyan"; this area still exists between [[Shamdhara]] ([[Yousafzai]] families still live there and are called [[Khankhel]]) and [[Chajjar Syedan]] (the [[Tirmizi]] families still live there). Signs of the ancient battles are easily found: hundred of human skulls can be unearthed after digging just a meter of ground. After a siege of several months, Hindus and Sikhs asked for safe passage to leave [[Shamdhara]].

After the [[Karlugh Turks]] were overthrown (the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] retained small lands everywhere), the tribes of the Syeds and Yousafzai established their rule on the plains of [[Pakhli]] the [[Chattar]], in the mountains of [[Kaghan Valley|Kaghan]], and in the Agror Valley. These areas were then divided among the above-mentioned tribes.

However, after the fall of Jhanjer Fort and Shamdhara, Syed Jalal Baba and his allies gained control of the area, and from that base embarked on military campaigns across the state. Since they met with little resistance, the Syeds and Yousafzai easily entered the Rush area of [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]].

In the 1850s the British captured Pakhli, Kaghan, and the Agror Valley from the Syeds and Yousafzai. Many Syeds and Yousafzai were killed and arrested by the British. Some Yousafzai made a truce with British, and now they all are titled as Khan of their areas. The majority of Syed and Yousafzai allies moved to the Black Mountain (Tor Ghar) (the location of famous villages Parari Syedan, Tikari, and Tilli Syedan) and in the mountains of Kaghan and Naran (village of Bugarmang). The British built a fort in 1865 (currently the headquarters of the [[Frontier Constabulary]] (FC)[[Oghi]] District) and deployed a battalion there. They also built a check post on the highest place of Oghi from which they watched and observed their enemies (this check post still exists and is known as "Picket").
The Black Mountain (Tor Ghar) tribes (Syeds and Yousafzai) had never been under direct British rule, although it was generally accounted to be part of the 'Frontier Region/Provincial Tribal Areas' from about 1901 onward and nominally attached to the then Hazara district. The tribes had been involved in fighting with British for quite some time, and a number of famous 'Black Mountain Expeditions' or 'Campaigns' took place between 1852 and the 1920s. A brief account of the British Expeditions against the Tor Ghar tribes follows:

* Under Lieutenant Colonel F. Mackeson, 1852–53, against the Hassanzais. The occasion was the murder of two British customs officers. A force of 3,800 British troops traversed their country, destroying their villages, grain, and crops.
* Under Major-General A. T. Wilde, 1868. The occasion was an attack on a British police post at Oghi in the Agror Valley by all three tribes. A force of 12,544 British troops entered the country and the tribes made peace.
* The First Hazara Expedition 1888. The cause was the constant raids made by the tribes on villages in British territory, culminating in an attack on a small British detachment, in which two English officers were killed. A force of 9,416 British troops traversed the country of the tribes, and severely punished them.
* The Second Hazara Expedition, 1891. The Black Mountain tribes fired on a force within British limits. A force of 7,300 British troops traversed the country. The tribesmen made peace and entered into an agreement with government to preserve the peace of the border.
Meanwhile, The Islamic State of Swat was established in 1849 under Syed Akbar Shah (the grandson of Pir Baba) with Sharia law remaining in force, but the state was in abeyance from 1878 to 1915. Thereafter, Syedd Abdul-Jabbar Shah, nephew of Syed Akbar Shah, was made ruler by a local Jirga and had trouble exercising power. Syed Abdul-Jabbar Shah become prime minister of the State of Amb in the late 1920s.

=== India ===
The Sayyid population in India is distributed. The total population of Sayyids in India is 7,017,000, the largest populations being those of [[Uttar Pradesh]] (1,493,000), [[Maharashtra]] (1,108,000), [[Karnataka]] (766,000), [[Andhra Pradesh]] (727,000), [[Rajasthan]] (497,000), [[Bihar]] (419,000), [[West Bengal]] (372,000), [[Madhya Pradesh]] (307,000), [[Gujarat]] (245,000), and [[Tamil Nadu]] (206,000), with 25,000 in [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="navhindtimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=18045&amp;rog3=IN |title=Sayyid in India |publisher=Joshua Project, a ministry of Frontier Ventures. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124020559/http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=18045&amp;rog3=IN |archivedate=24 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sayyids are also found in the north-eastern state of [[Assam]], where locally they are also referred to as ''Dawans''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=7wrPUL6MGNDPrQeY-4CwDA&amp;id=9zYaAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=syeds+of+India&amp;q=syeds Stratification, hierarchy, and ethnicity in North-east India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610162704/https://books.google.com/books?ei=7wrPUL6MGNDPrQeY-4CwDA&amp;id=9zYaAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=syeds+of+India&amp;q=syeds |date=10 June 2016 }}, Ranjit K.

In India, Sayyids of Hadramawt (who originated mainly from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]) gained widespread fame. There is a big community of Sayyids settled in and around the Nanganallur region in Chennai. They can trace their ancestry directly to the Sayyids of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/1568531043584872 Early Modern India: Sayyids of Hadhramaut in Early Modern India] Author: Omar Khalidi, Source: Asian Journal of Social Science, Volume 32, Issue 3, pages 329 – 352, Subjects: Social Sciences, Publication Year : 2004, DOI: 10.1163/1568531043584872, {{ISSN|1568-4849}}, E-{{ISSN|1568-5314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== North India ====
The earliest migration of Sayyids from Afghanistan to [[North India]] took place in 1032{{nbsp}}AD when [[Gazi Saiyyed Salar Sahu]] (general and brother-in-law of [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]) and his son [[Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud]] established their military headquarters at [[Satrikh]] ({{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from [[Zaidpur]]) in the [[Barabanki district]], Uttar Pradesh. They are considered to be the first Muslim settlers in North India. In 1033{{nbsp}}AD Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud was killed at the battle of [[Bahraich]], the location of his ''[[Mazar (mausoleum)|mazr]]''. Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud had no children. Iraqi Sayyids or Iraqi biradri in Eastern Uttar Pradesh are descendants of Sayyid Masud Al Hussaini who was direct descendant of Prophet's grandson Hussain ibn Ali and came to India from Iraq during the reign of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq in 1330 A.D. He settled with his seven sons and forty champions in Ghazipur (U.P.). This is because some of them converted to Sunni Islam in the reign of Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi. His Shia descendants are now known as Sayyids of Ghazipur. [[Syed Ahmed Rizvi Kashmiri]] and Khan Bahadur Aga Syed Hussain were both [[Rizvi]] Sayyids through Aaqa Meer Sayyid Hussain Qomi Rizvi, whose sacred shrine is in the Zainageer Village of Sopore, [[Kashmir]].

Sayyids of Syed nagli, or Said Nagli, or the Baquari Syeds had migrated from [[Termez]] (Present day Uzbekistan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VnmEMh0MF4C |title=Sayyids and Sharifs in Muslim Societies: The Living Links to the Prophet |first=Kazuo |last=Morimoto |date=1 January 2012 |publisher=Routledge |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the Sultanate era.

He was a Baquari Syed who drew his lineage from Imam Mohammad al Baqir.

Perhaps the most important figure in the history of the Sayyid in Uttar Pradesh was Sayyid Basrullah Shustari, who moved from [[Mashad]] in [[Iran]] in 1549 and joined the court of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar]]. Akbar later appointed Shustari as his chief justice, and Shustari used his position to strengthen the position of the various Sayyid families. They were preferred in administrative posts, and formed a privileged elite. When the Mughal Empire disintegrated, the Sayyid played an important role in turbulent politics of the time. The new [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial authorities that replaced the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] after the [[Battle of Buxar]] also made a pragmatic decision to work with the various Sayyid [[jagirdar]]s. Several Sayyid [[taluqdar]]s in [[Awadh]] were substantial landowners under the British colonial regime, and many other Sayyid still played their part in the administration of the state.&lt;ref name=Hasan&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three, edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das&lt;/ref&gt; After abolition of [[zamindar]]i system many Sayyid zamindars (e.g. that of [[Ghazipur]]) had to leave their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNKqYp-LTnkC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=syeds%20of%20India&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e_vOUNCWKIrsrAezgoHADA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=syeds&amp;f=false |title=Legacy of a Divided Nation: India's Muslims Since Independence |first=Mushirul |last=Hasan |date=1 January 1997 |publisher=Hurst |accessdate=22 September 2016 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancestor of the Bārha Sayyids, Sayyid Abu'l Farah Al Hussaini Al Wasti&lt;nowiki/&gt; left his original home in [[Wasit, Iraq]], with his twelve sons at the end of the 13th century (or the beginning of the 14th century) and migrated to India, where he obtained four villages in [[Sirhind-Fategarh]].

===== Present circumstances =====
The Sayyids are found throughout [[Uttar Pradesh]], with [[Faizabad]], [[Muzaffarnagar district|Muzaffarnagar]] [[Balrampur]], [[Raibareli]], [[Hallaur]], [[Wasa Dargah]], [[Lucknow]], [[Barabanki city|Barabanki]], [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]], [[Bhadohi]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Kanpur]] [[Azamgarh]], [[Allahabad]], [[Amroha]], [[Bareilly district|Bareilly]], [[Meerut]] and [[Aligarh]] being home to large Sayyid communities. They generally speak [[Urdu]], and most also understand the various dialects of [[Hindi]]. The Sayyid are divided along sectarian lines, with a slight majority belonging to the [[Shia]] sect, especially in the [[Awadh]] region, while the [[Sunni]] are found mainly in the western districts. They are further divided into discreat endigamous clans, bases on territorial groupings. The most important ones are the [[Abidi Saadat-e-Phoolpur Dist Balrampur|Abidi Sadaat-e-Phoolpur Dist Balrampur]] [[Saadat-e-Karari|Sadaat-e-Karari]], [[Saadat-e-Jais|Sadaat-e-Jais]] [[Saadat-e-Bara|Sadaat-e-Bara]], [[Saadat-e-Kundharki|Sadaat-e-Kundharki]], [[Sadaat Amroha]], [[Sadaat-e-Barabanki]], [[Sadaat e Saithal|Sadaat-e-Saithal]],  Sadaat-e-Sirsi, [[Sadaat-e-Rudauli]], [[Hallaur|Sayyids of Hallaur]], [[Wasa Dargah|Sayyids of Wasa Dargah]], [[Sadaat-e-Bilgram]] and Sadaat-e-Barn, Sadaat-e-[http://www.chholassadat.com/ Chholas], Sadaat-e-Jarcha and [[Syed Nagli|Sadaat-e-Nagli.]] Other groupings include the [[Alavi (surname)|Alavi]], [[Abidi]], [[Baqiri]] or Baquari, [[Barcha]], [[Bukhari (surname)|Bukhari]], [[Jafri|Jafari]], [[Jalali (surname)|Jalali]], [[Kazmi]], [[Naqvi]], [[Rizvi]], [[Tirmizi]] and [[Zaidi (Last Name)|Zaidi]], each claiming descent from a particular [[Shia]] Imam. Sayyids often include the following titles in their names to indicate the figure from whom they trace their descent. If they are descended from more than one notable ancestor or Shi'a [[Imam]], they will use the title of the ancestor from whom they are most directly descended.

Traditional Sayyid families rarely marry outside their community, with an emphasis of marrying into ''Najeeb Altarfain'' (of Sayyid descent from both the mother’s and father’s side) families. This insistence on endogamy has begun to decline among the more urbanized families, with an increase inter marriage with other group such as the [[Shaikh of Uttar Pradesh|Shaikh]] and [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughals]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part Three edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 1246 to 1254 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the Sayyids of UP were substantial landowners, often absentees, and this was especially the case with the [[Awadh]] [[taluqdar]]s. In the urban townships, Sayyid families served as priests, teachers and administrators, with the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial authorities given the community a preference in recruitment. Though they are less than 3% of Muslim population, they control a majority of economic resources.The community also has a very high literacy rate.The independence and [[partition of India]] in 1947 was traumatic for the community, with many families becoming divided, with some members moved to [[Pakistan]]. This was followed by the abolishment of the [[zamindar]]i system, where land was redistributed to those who till the land. Many Sayyids who remained on the land are now medium and small scale farmers. While in the urban areas, there has been a shift towards modern occupations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=====Gujarat=====
In Gujarat, most of the Sayyid families are descended from individuals invited by the [[Gujarat Sultanate|Muslim rulers of Gujarat]] to serve as advisers and administrators, and granted ''[[jagir]]s''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} During the period of Sultan [[Mahmud Begada]] (1458–1511), the Sayyid of Gothada, Thasra, and Pali, a Zaidi Sayyid{{snd}}[[Saadat-e-Bara]]. Sultan Mahmud Begada provided land to three Sayyid brothers and a grant to settle there after the victory of [[Pavagadh]] fort. In 1484 the young Sultan, after laying siege to the fort for twenty months, conquered it on 21 November 1484. He then transferred his capital to [[Champaner]], which he completely rebuilt at the foothills of the Pavagadh fort, calling it [[Muhammadabad]]. During Mughal rule in Gujarat (1570–1750), they held the majority of the civil and ecclesiastical posts. For example, the Sayyids of Thasra, [[Kheda district]] were invited to serve as administrators and judges by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal Emperor]], [[Aurangzeb]], and provided [[land grant]]s to settle there. They also provided an important element in the Mughal army, and many are still found in the old Muslim garrison towns such as [[Ahmedabad]]. In addition, many of the early Sufi saints that came to Gujarat belonged to Sayyid families. Most of these Sayyid families came from Central Asia, Iran, Yemen, [[Oman]], Basra, and Bahrain.&lt;ref name="name=ReferenceB"&gt;Shajra-e-Nasab (Syed family tree) Sadat e Gothada -Jahidali J.Saiyad, Gothada&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2016}}

Bihar

In bihar, sayyids settled from the 13th century onwards, many sufi saints of bihar were sayyids, most famous was Makhdoom yahya maneri(d:1381 Ad).

Apparently the most prominent sayyids of bihar has been Malick community, who descended from the seven sons and immediate blood  relatives of sayid Ibrahim Malick,(d 1353 Ad) who was also a ruler of bihar and a famous sufi Saint. In bihar sayyids were landlords, barristers, intellectuals, clerics, teachers, businessmen and farmers.They had apparently strong hold of bihari politics prior to independence of india, as the first chief minister of bihar during the british india was barrister yunus of panhar,  also a sayyid of mallick community, There is also a small minority of twelver sayyids in bihar.

====South India====

=====Kerala=====
[[Kerala]] has a two-thousand-year-old association with Arabia. In [[Malayalam]], ''[[Thangal]]'' is an honorific Muslim title almost equivalent to the Arabic term Sayyid, which is given to males believed to be descendants of Muhammad. The present day Thangals are supposed to be descended from Sayyid families who migrated from the historic city of [[Tarim, Yemen|Tarim]], in the Hadhramaut Province, Yemen, during the 17th century in order to propagate Islam on the [[Malabar Coast]]. Sayyids selected coastal areas to settle. The royal family of [[Arakkal kingdom|Arakkal]] in Kerala had Thangal origins.&lt;ref name="navhindtimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://twocircles.net/2011jul12/hadrami_diaspora_indian_ocean_territories_special_reference_malabar.html Hadrami diaspora in Indian Ocean territories, with special reference to Malabar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718190524/http://twocircles.net/2011jul12/hadrami_diaspora_indian_ocean_territories_special_reference_malabar.html |date=18 July 2013 }} By Zubair Hudawi&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tamil Nadu=====
There are a notable number of Sayyids in Tamil Nadu mostly concentrated in the cities like [[Erwadi]], [[Nagore]], [[Madurai]] and Kayalpattinam. Badusha Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed of [[Ervadi]] a Hussaini descendant of Prophet Mohammed and a ruler of [[Madinah]] travelled to South India in mid 12th century. His descendants who live at Ervadi with the clan name of Levvai are from a single forefather and are Sayyids. The heirs of Hazrat Shahul Hamid Abdul Qadir badusha of [[Nagore]] who live there and are called with clan name of Sahib or Saab or Saabu are Sayyids. Hazrat Kazi Syed Tajuddin the son of Mufti Jamaluddin al Ma'abari who founded the [[Kazimar Big Mosque]] in 13th century the first mosque in Madurai is from Syed family. Till today his descendants (Syeds-Qazis-Huqdars) have managed to live in the same [[Kazimar Street]] locality in the center of Madurai city for over 7 centuries and are managing the Kazimar Big Mosque constructed by their forefather. Syed Tajuddin's younger son Hazrat Kazi Alauddin lived in Kayalpattinam and his shrine is found there. His female descendants live there.

== Southeast Asia ==
Most of the Alawi Sayyids who moved to [[Southeast Asia]] were descendants of [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin]], especially of [[Ba 'Alawi sada]], majority descendants of migrants from Hadhramaut. Even though they are alleged descendants of [[Husain ibn Ali|Imam Husain]], it is uncommon for the female Sayyids to be called ''Sayyidah'', they are more commonly called ''Sharifah''. Most of them live in [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Moro Province]] in [[Philippines]], and [[Pattani]]. Many of the royal families of this region such as the previous royal families of Philippines (Sultanate of Sulu), Singapore (Sultanate of North Borneo), Malaysia (Sultanates of Johor and Malacca) and Indonesia (Sultanates of Siak, Pontianak,  Gowa, some Javanese Sultanates)  and the existing royal family of Brunei (House of Bolkiah) are also are Sayyids, especially of [[Ba'Alawi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=6224672A7D9E4E2C466B8A121385DD3A.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=6109016 ‘Strangers’ and ‘stranger-kings’: The sayyid in eighteenth-century maritime Southeast Asia] By Jeyamalar Kathirithamby-Wells&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghatreh.org/view/3501/Development-of-Islam-in-Southeast-Asia-by-Alawi-Sayyids |title=Development of Islam in Southeast Asia by Alawi Sayyids |accessdate=22 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111125039/http://www.ghatreh.org/view/3501/Development-of-Islam-in-Southeast-Asia-by-Alawi-Sayyids |archivedate=11 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5VnmEMh0MF4C&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=sayyids+in+South+East+Asia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O0691fUjQM&amp;sig=tiNQWb8le-zjCjm5_PdiOhzm7-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_MTJUMWcD4XUrQeb4IDgDQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=sayyids%20in%20South%20East%20Asia&amp;f=false Sayyids and Sharifs in Muslim Society: The Living Links to the Prophet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505155534/https://books.google.com/books?id=5VnmEMh0MF4C&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=sayyids+in+South+East+Asia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O0691fUjQM&amp;sig=tiNQWb8le-zjCjm5_PdiOhzm7-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_MTJUMWcD4XUrQeb4IDgDQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAw |date=5 May 2016 }} By Kazuo Morimoto&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=sayyids+in+South+East+Asia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3WtWJ838XX&amp;sig=20KO8zoMvBxvsI7N4VLN3rla378&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_MTJUMWcD4XUrQeb4IDgDQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=sayyids%20in%20South%20East%20Asia&amp;f=false Southeast Asia (3 Volumes): A Historical Encyclopedia from Angkor Wat to East Timor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609192653/https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=sayyids+in+South+East+Asia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3WtWJ838XX&amp;sig=20KO8zoMvBxvsI7N4VLN3rla378&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_MTJUMWcD4XUrQeb4IDgDQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA |date=9 June 2016 }} By Keat Gin Ooi&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common surnames of these Sayyids are al-Saqqaf, Shihab (or Shahab), al-Aidaroos, al-Habsyi (or al-Habshi), al-Kaff, al-Aththos, al-Haddad, al-Jufri (or al-Jifri), al-Muhdhar, al-Shaikh Abubakar, al-Qadri, al-Munawwar (see [[Ba 'Alawi sada]] for a more complete list).

== Tesayyid ==
In the Ottoman Empire, tax breaks for "the People of the House" encouraged many people to buy certificates of descent or forge genealogies; the phenomenon of ''teseyyüd'' – falsely claiming noble ancestry – spread across ethnic, class, and religious boundaries. In the 17th century, an Ottoman bureaucrat estimated that there were 300,000 impostors. In 18th-century Anatolia, nearly all upper-class urban people claimed descent from Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Canbakal |first=Hülya |title=The Ottoman State and Descendants of the Prophet in Anatolia and the Balkans (c. 1500–1700) |journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient |year=2009 |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=542–578 |doi=10.1163/156852009X458241 |issn=0022-4995 |publisher=[[Koninklijke Brill NV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maternal descendance ==
According to Iran's religious leader&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document |title=Rules of Khums |author=Ayatollah Khamenei |url=http://www.leader.ir/en/book/pdf/t/38/5864 |p=5 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429000028/http://www.leader.ir/en/book/pdf/t/38/5864 |archivedate=29 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Deobandi]] creed, which is a creed especially followed by patriarchal [[Pashtun tribes]], the status of being a Sayyid can only be attributed through the patrilineal lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Ahsan Ul Fatawa By Mufti Rasheed Ahmad Ludhyanvi احسن الفتاوی&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Shia Islam|Shia]] opinions, children of a Sayyida mother and a non-Sayyid father are referred to as [[Mirza]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Persian notation "Mirza", which is a derivation of the word "Mirzada" i.e. Son of a [[Mir (title)|"Mir"]] has various meanings. One of the meanings of [[Mir (title)|"Mir"]] is a Sayyid leader of a Sayyid branch or community, simultaneously being a religious Islamic scholar. Thus, a Sayyid of patrilineal lineage, being the son of a [[Mir (title)|Mir]] can also be called "Mirza". This example substantiates the fact that there are different opinions concerning the transmission of the title "Sayyid". Another historical opinion of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Naqib al-ashraf|Naqib al Ashrafs]] expresses that children of maternal prophetical descent are called "[[Sharif]]".&lt;ref name="Morimoto2012"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Kazuo Morimoto |title=Sayyids and Sharifs in Muslim Societies: The Living Links to the Prophet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSzcaSf5vDsC&amp;pg=PT26 |year=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-33738-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}}

However, in 1632 when an Ottoman court challenged a man wearing a ''sayyid''{{'s}} green turban, he established that he was a ''sayyid'' on his mother's side, and this was accepted by the court.&lt;ref name="Morimoto2012"/&gt;{{rp|130}}&lt;!--Female line descent contradicts next paragraph (as it was on 3 Oct 14), but the acceptance of women's lineage is considered important and discussed at length in the source. It may be that female descent was accepted in some societies but not others?--&gt;
 
In patriarchal societies, women usually have to assimilate themselves into their husbands status.  However, this does not affect female descendants of the [[Prophet Muhammad|prophet]], since it is seen as a sacred blood relation. Thus, the heraldic title can be given to an individual through his or hers mother's line in accordance to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Naqib al-ashraf|Naqib al-Ashrafs]].&lt;ref name="Morimoto2012"/&gt; Even the Zaynabids, the descendants of [[Zainab binte Ali|Lady Zainab]], the daughter of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] can also be titled "Sayyid" or "Sharif", according to the Egyptian [[Al-Suyuti|Imam al Suyuti]].&lt;ref&gt;Jalal al-Din Al-Suyuti, al-Ajaja al-zarnabiyya fi al-sulula al Zaynabiyya, in al-Suyuti Hawai li-l-fatawi, 2 vols (Cairo1352/1933) Vol II p.31-34&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tajikistan]] matrilineal descendants are also honored.&lt;ref&gt;The Origins of the Civil War in Tajikistan: Nationalism, Islamism, and Violent Conflict in Post-Soviet Space, Tim Epkenhans, Chapter 7 p.266&lt;/ref&gt; The fact why there is no total consensus indicating Sayyids and abandoning individuals of maternal descent, may be to limit the number, because of financial reasons, such as [[Khums]] or governmental support especially for Sayyids.

'''''Skeptic''''', colloquially known as '''''Skeptic magazine''''', is a quarterly [[science education]] and science advocacy [[magazine]] published internationally by [[The Skeptics Society]], a [[nonprofit]] organization devoted to promoting [[scientific skepticism]] and resisting the spread of [[pseudoscience]], [[superstition]], and [[irrationality|irrational]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/what_we_do/ |title=What We Do |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Skeptic (U.S. magazine) |access-date=March 5, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Michael Shermer]], founder of the Skeptics Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/meet_michael_shermer.html "Meet Michael Shermer"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine was first published in the spring of 1992 and is published through Millennium Press.
Shermer remains the Publisher and [[Editor-in-Chief]] of the magazine and the magazine’s Co-publisher and [[Art Director]] is Pat Linse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/masthead.html |title=Masthead, ''Skeptic'' Magazine. |accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy members of its editorial board include, or have included, [[Oxford University]] [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning scientist [[Jared Diamond]], [[Magician (illusion)|magician]] and [[escape artist]] turned educator [[James Randi|James “The Amazing” Randi]], actor, comedian, and ''[[Saturday Night Live]] '' alumna [[Julia Sweeney]], professional mentalist [[Mark Edward]], science writer [[Daniel Loxton]], [[Lawrence M. Krauss]] and [[Christof Koch]].
''Skeptic'' has an international circulation with over 50,000 subscriptions and is on newsstands in the U.S. and Canada as well as Europe, Australia, and other countries.&lt;ref name="skeptic.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.vueweekly.com/making_a_living_of_bullshit_detecting/ | title=Making a living of bullshit detecting | publisher=[[VUE Weekly]] |date=August 27, 2008 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History, format and structure ==
The cover story of the magazine's very first issue paid tribute to [[scientist]] and [[science-fiction]] writer [[Isaac Asimov]].
&lt;ref name=Skeptic1&gt;[http://shop.skeptic.com/merchant.mvc?&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=SS&amp;Product_Code=magv01n1&amp;Category_Code=BIA "Vol. 1 No.1 (Premiere Issue) Tribute to Isaac Asimov"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As Asimov wrote a number of stories featuring robots and coined the term "[[robotics]]", the cover of volume 12, #2 (2006), which is devoted to the topic of artificial intelligence, depicts a [[robot]] sitting on a park bench reading that first issue.&lt;ref name="Skeptic2"&gt;[http://shop.skeptic.com/merchant.mvc?&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=SS&amp;Product_Code=magv12n2 "Vol. 12 No. 2 Artificial Intelligence"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every issue of the magazine opens with a description of The Skeptics Society and its mission statement, which is to explore subjects such as [[creationism]], [[pyramid power]], [[Bigfoot]], [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical claims]] (as in the examples of [[Holocaust denial]] and extreme [[Afrocentrism]]), the use or misuse of theory and [[statistics]], [[conspiracy theories]], [[urban myths]], [[witch-hunt]]s, [[mass hysterias]], [[genius]] and [[intelligence]], and cultural influences on science, as well as controversies involving [[protoscience]]s at the leading edge of established science, and even [[fads]] like [[cryonics]] and [[low-carb diet]]s.  In addition to publishing the magazine, the Society also:

* sponsors lecture series at the [[California Institute of Technology]]
* produces and sells tapes of the lectures, as well as other books on pertinent subjects
* holds field trips to investigate and research such subjects
* conducts social events to promote good-will
* provides resources for the public, skeptic organizations (such as [[SkeptiCamp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepticamp.org | title=Skepticamp | accessdate =2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the media, with which they may approach controversial subjects from a skeptical viewpoint

In 2011, the magazine had three regular columnists: [[James Randi]] wrote "’Twas Brillig…," [[Harriet A. Hall]] wrote "The Skep Doc" and [[Karen Stollznow]] wrote "Bad Language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Table of Contents | magazine=Skeptic | publisher=Skeptics Society | url=http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/archives/vol16n02.html | volume=16 | issue=2 | accessdate=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine's page count was between approximately 100 and 110 pages until the 2010s. It was reduced to approximately 80 pages with Vol. 16 No. 3 (2011).{{CN|date=March 2018}} {{As of |2018}}, the magazine had two regular columnists: Harriet A. Hall and [[Carol Tavris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeptic: CURRENT ISSUE: VOLUME 23 NUMBER 1|url=https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/|website=skeptic.com|publisher=Skeptic Magazine|accessdate=30 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330232530/https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/|archivedate=30 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Typical topics ===
Each issue features an [[editorial]]. In the past this was provided by [[James Randi]], and was often a reaction to stories from mainstream news media such as the 2005 story by the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[newsmagazine]] ''[[Primetime Live]]'' featuring a [[Brazil]]ian [[faith healer]], [[João de Deus (medium)|João Teixeira]].{{CN|date=March 2018}} Other times Randi wrote about topics he had investigated in the past, such as alleged [[dowser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/11-08-31/#feature/|title = A Report from the Paranormal Trenches|website=Skeptic.com|publisher=Skeptic Magazine|accessdate=30 March 2018|date = 2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleged [[psychic]]s like [[Sylvia Browne]], and UFOs.{{CN|date=March 2018}}

The magazine also features a large correspondence section called "Forum". This includes not only letters from lay readers but also in-depth comments and rebuttals from [[professional]]s, contributing to extended academic debate across issues raised in past editions.{{CN|date=March 2018}}

The bulk of the magazine treats a variety of topics. [[Front cover|Cover stories]] have ranged from examination of alleged [[UFO]]s in [[religious icons]] and theories of the likelihood of [[artificial intelligence]] to tributes to luminaries such as [[Isaac Asimov]]&lt;ref name=Skeptic1/&gt; and [[Ernst Mayr]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sulloway, Frank J.]] (February 2005). [http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-02-11/ "Ernst Mayr, 1904–2005Remembrances &amp; Tribute"]. ''Skeptic''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some editions feature special sections devoted to a particular topic or theme that is examined through multiple articles by different authors, such as [[intelligent design]] - a frequently recurring topic in the magazine, given the ongoing [[creation vs. evolution controversy]].{{CN|date=March 2018}}

=== ''Junior Skeptic'' ===
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:JuniorSkeptic.jpg|thumb|right|''Junior Skeptic'' focuses on one topic, and is written and illustrated in a manner more appealing to children]] --&gt;
Bound into most issues is a 10-page young-readers' section called ''[[Junior Skeptic]]''.  Heralded by a cover printed on glossy paper (the rest of the magazine is printed on non-glossy stock), ''Junior Skeptic'' focuses on one topic, or provides practical instruction written and illustrated in a style more appealing to children.

[[Daniel Loxton]] is the Editor of ''Junior Skeptic''. He writes and illustrates most issues.

The first edition of ''Junior Skeptic'' appeared in volume 6, #2 of ''Skeptic'' (2000).

'''Suhūr''' or '''Suhoor''' ({{lang-ar|سحور}} ''saḥūr'', lit. "of the dawn", "pre-dawn meal"; is an [[Islam]]ic term referring to the meal consumed early in the morning by [[Muslim]]s before fasting, [[sawm]], before dawn during or outside the [[Islam]]ic month of [[Ramadan]]. It is usually done around 4:00 AM. The meal is eaten before [[fajr prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = BBC - Schools - Religion - Islam  | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/religion/islam/ramadan.shtml  | accessdate = 11 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Also, Fajr Prayer can be prayed after Suhoor. Suhur is matched to [[iftar]] as the evening meal, during Ramadan, replacing the traditional three meals a day ([[breakfast]], [[lunch]] and [[dinner]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = BBC - Schools - Religion - Islam  | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/religion/islam/ramadan.shtml  | accessdate = 11 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although in some places dinner is also consumed after Iftar later during the night. Being the last meal eaten by Muslims before fasting from dawn to sunset during the month of Ramadan, sahur is regarded by Islamic traditions as a benefit of the [[barakah|blessings]] in that it allows the person fasting to avoid the crankiness or the weakness caused by the fast.

According to a hadith in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]], [[Anas ibn Malik]] narrated, "The Prophet said, 'take suhoor as there is a blessing in it.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Bukhari'': Book 3: Vol. 31: Hadith 146 (Fasting).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mesaharati==
The mesaharati (public waker)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pictures: Celebrating Ramadan Around the World|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/07/pictures/140719-ramadan-islam-muslim-holiday-festival-culture/#/173261229-10_81773_600x450.jpg|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=10 August 2014|date=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a public waker for sahur and dawn prayer during Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda Wong|title=Sentence essentials: a grammar guide|publisher=Houghton Mifflin, 2002|isbn=9780618154821|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Angelo Colorni|title=Israel for Beginners: A Field Guide for Encountering the Israelis in Their Natural Habitat|publisher=Gefen Publishing House Ltd, 2011|isbn=9789652294838|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jamāl Ghīṭānī|author2=Farouk Abdel Wahab (translator)|title=The Zafarani Files|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press, 2009|isbn=9789774161902|page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the history books, [[Bilal Ibn Rabah]] was the first mesaharati in Islamic history, as he used to roam the streets and roads throughout the night to wake people up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rima Al-Mukhtar|title=Ramadan Mesaharati|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/387195|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=Arab News|date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occupation is summed up by Abu Rabah, a mesaharati in his neighbourhood in the old city of [[Damascus]]: "My duty during the holy month of Ramadhan is to wake people up in the old city of Damascus for prayers and Sahur meal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=HUMMAM SHEIKH ALI|title=Charm of Ramadhan in Damascus|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/art-culture/2011/08/19/charm-ramadhan-damascus|accessdate=10 August 2014|work=Xinhua|publisher=Brunei Times Sdn Bhd|date=August 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812203527/http://www.bt.com.bn/art-culture/2011/08/19/charm-ramadhan-damascus|archivedate=12 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Abbas Qatish, who is considered [[Sidon]]'s best mesaharati, the attributes every mesaharati should possess are physical fitness and good health, "because he is required to walk long distances every day. He should also have a loud voice and good lungs, as well as an ability to read poems. A mesaharati should supplicate God throughout the night to wake the sleepers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Vivian Haddad|title=The Mesaharati, Still Part of Sidon’s Ramadan Tradition|url=http://english.aawsat.com/vivian-haddad/lifestyle-culture/the-mesaharati-still-part-of-sidons-ramadan-tradition|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=Asharq Al Awsat|date=23 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition is practiced in countries such as Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Pakistan and Palestine. However, there has been a gradual disappearance of the mesaharati due to several factors, including: Muslims staying up later; using technology such as alarms clocks to awake for sahur; and louder and larger homes and cities that make the voice of the mesaharati harder to hear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rima Al-Mukhtar|title=Ramadan Mesaharati|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/387195|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=Arab News|date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''U Vimala''' ({{lang-my|မိုးကုတ်ဆရာတော် ဦးဝိမလ}}, commonly known as the '''Mogok Sayadaw'''; 27 December 1899 - 17 October 1962) was a renowned [[bhikkhu]] and [[vipassanā]] meditation master of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="ac"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aung Chi|title=The Mogok Sayadaw: A Translation|location=Yangon|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Mogok Sayadaw.jpg|thumb|Mogok Sayadaw seated.]]

He was born [[Burmese names|Maung]] Hla Baw to Daw Shwe Ake and U Aung Tun in a small village close to [[Amarapura]] in Mandalay Province, Burma on 27 December 1899.&lt;ref name="swaytin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismyanmar.com/nibbana/mogokst1.htm |title=The Mogok Sayadaw |last=Sway Tin |date=15 November 1999 |work=Nibbana.com |accessdate=23 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927024942/http://www.thisismyanmar.com/nibbana/mogokst1.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hla Baw began his education at 4, and enrolled as a [[Śrāmaṇera|samanera]] or novitiate at age 9 under U Jagara.&lt;ref name="swaytin"/&gt; He later left for Mingala Makuna Monastery at Amarapura to continue his religious studies.&lt;ref name="swaytin"/&gt;

==Monkhood==
In 1920,&lt;ref name="swaytin"/&gt; he was ordained as a [[bhikkhu]] (monk) in the tradition of [[Buddhism in Burma|Burmese Buddhism]] with the [[dharma name]] Vimala ({{my|ဝိမလ}}) which means "stainless, Undefiled." As his monkhood was sponsored by the residents of [[Mogok]], a town well known for rubies and gems, Vimala became known as "Mogok". In 1924, Vimala became the chief abbot of [[Pikara Monastery]]. He began to give sermons focusing on [[abhidharma|abhidhamma]] and teaching vipassana meditation.&lt;ref name="swaytin"/&gt;
He attained Nirvana by practicing meditation for four years and became an Arhat. Then, he disseminated his method to the pupils for attaining Nirvana. He focused on the insight learning of the dynamic nature of mind and materials in his teaching. His teaching audio recordings are still available and learnt by Myanmar Buddhists to learn meditation methods.

==Legacy==
U Vimala established the Mogok tradition of [[vipassana]] meditation, which is independent of the meditation traditions established by his Burmese predecessors, [[Ledi Sayadaw]] and [[Mahasi Sayadaw]].&lt;ref name="crosby"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crosby|first=Kate|title=Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=2013|isbn=9781118323298}}&lt;/ref&gt; U Vimala stressed dependent origination and cittanupassana as part of meditation practice.&lt;ref name="crosby"/&gt; There are currently over 300 meditation centers in Burma that teach his form of meditation.&lt;ref name="crosby"/&gt;

[[File:Zoroastrian_Fire_Temple_in_Yazd.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Yazd Atash Behram]]
The '''Yazd Atash Behram''', also known as '''Atashkadeh-e Yazd'''), is a temple in [[Yazd]], [[Yazd province]], [[Iran]]. It was built in 1934 and enshrines the [[Atash Bahram]], meaning “Victorious Fire”, dated to 470 AD.  It is one of the nine Atash Behrams, the only one of the highest grade fire in Iran where [[Zoroastrians]] have practiced their religion since 400 BC; the other eight Atash Behrams are in [[India]].{{Sfn|Ejaz|2010|p=18}}&lt;ref name=Atash&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/yazd/zoroastrian.htm#atashkadeh|first=K. E. |last=Eduljee|title=Yazd|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=Heritage Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aga Rustam Noshiravan Belivani, of Sharifabad, the Anjuman-i Nasiri (elected Zoroastrian officials)
opened the Yazd Atash Behram in the 1960s to non-Zoroastrian visitors.

==Background==
The temple is located in [[Yazd]],{{Sfn|Iyer|2009|p=311}} to the west of [[Shiraz]], in the desert [[Yazd Province|province of Yazda]], where Zoroastrians have practiced their religion since about 400 BC.&lt;ref name=Travel&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/travel/a/7297865/iran-treasures-and-contrasts/|first=Georgina|last=Steytler|title=Iran: treasures and contrasts|accessdate=13 April 2015|date=26 May 2010|publisher= ''[[The West Australian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on the Ayatullah Kashani Avenue and is {{Convert|6|km}} away from Yazd Airport.{{Sfn|Giara|2002|p=172}}

The highest grade of fire temples were first constructed in the [[Sasanian Empire]] for the reverence of fire, which is the manifestation of [[Ahura Mazda]] in the Zoroastrian religion.{{Sfn|Ejaz|2010|p=18}} According to the Zoroastrian religion, this type of fire is consecrated by sixteen different sources, including the fire created by a [[lightning|lightning bolt]].{{Sfn|Rogerson|2013|p=140}}

==History==
According to an inscription plaque fixed on the shrine, the construction of the Yazd Atash Behram temple is dated to 1934. The funds for building it were provided by the Association of the [[Parsi]] Zoroastrians of India. Construction was done under the guidance of Jamshid Amanat. The sacred fire of the temple is stated to have been burning since about 470 AD;&lt;ref name=Atash/&gt; originally started by the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian Shah]] when it was in the [[Karyan, Fars|Pars Karyan]] fire temple in southern Pars district of [[Larestan County|Larestan]].{{Sfn|Rogerson|2013|p=140}}  From there it was transferred to [[Aqda]] where it was kept for 700 years. The fire was then moved in 1173 to Nahid-e Pars temple in nearby [[Ardakan]], where it remained for 300 years until it was moved again to the house of a high priest in Yazd, and was finally consecrated in the new temple in 1934.&lt;ref name=Atash/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bahram&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/temples/atashbahram.htm|first=K. E. |last=Eduljee|title=Zoroastrian Places of Worship|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=Heritage Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A bust of Manekji Limji Hataria, who was instrumental in raising funds for building the temple, has been installed in the precincts of the temple. The bust also displays the Zoroastrian divine symbols of the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]].{{sfn|Warden|2002|p=32}}

==Features==
[[File:Zoroastrian Fire Temple, Yazd (2).jpg|right|thumb|Zoroastrian Eternal Flame at the Fire Temple in Yazd, Central Iran]]
The fire temple is built in [[Achaemenid architecture]] style in brick masonry to the design prepared by the architects from [[Bombay]]. It is similar in design to the Atash Behram temples in India. The building is surrounded by a garden which has fruit trees.{{Sfn|Godrej|Mistree|2002|p=315}} There is a winged deity of the [[Ahura Mazda]] embedded on the front door of the temple.{{Sfn|Karber|2012|p=160}} 

The sacred fire is installed in the temple behind an amber tinted glass enclosure. Only Zoroastrians are allowed to go to the sanctum area of the fire. Non-Zoroastrians can only view it from outside the glass chamber.{{Sfn|Godrej|Mistree|2002|p=285}} The Anjuman-i Nasiri 
opened the Yazd Atash Behram in the 1960s to non-Zoroastrian visitors.{{Sfn|Godrej|Mistree|2002|p=323}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1817">'''Yekutiel ben Yehudah Leib Gordon''' ({{lang-he|יקותיאל גורדון}}; died after 1742) was a [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] and [[physician]] from [[Vilnius|Vilna]], and one of the main disciples of [[Rabbi]] [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] (1707–1746). As such, he was one of the main conduits of Luzzatto's teachings from [[Padua]] to Eastern Europe.

Gordon came to [[Italy]] in order to study [[medicine]] at the [[University of Padua]]. It is there that he met Luzzatto, under whom he learned [[Torah]] and [[Kabbalah]]. He considered leaving his medical studies in order to dedicate himself to the study of Kabbalah; however, Luzzatto urged him not to; he insisted that his ''maggid'' or mystical teacher wished for Gordon to be successful in both areas.

Gordon was thus unwittingly the initial source of publicity of Luzzatto's ''maggid'': he wrote an account to his teacher in Vilna, thus initiating much of the controversy that surrounded Luzzatto. While he was greatly pained by this matter, the ''maggid'' insisted that these developments were heaven-sent.

Gordon was one of the [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribe]]rs of Luzzatto's writings. Following Luzzatto's death and the dissolution of his followers, Gordon returned to [[Poland]], where he established a group of his own which separated itself from the general community and adopted its own dress.

{{About|one of the six ''[[dravya]]s'' in Jainism|the Hindu and Buddhist term Ākāśa referring to æther or space|Ākāśa}}
{{refimprove|date=March 2018}}
{{Jainism}}
'''''Ākāśa''''' is [[space]] in the [[Jainism|Jain]] conception of the [[Jain cosmology|cosmos]]. Akash is one of the six ''[[Dravya (Jainism)|dravya]]s'' (substances) and it accommodates&lt;ref&gt;Uttaradhyan sutra, Ch. 28&lt;/ref&gt; the other five, namely sentient beings or souls (''[[Jīva (Jainism)|jīva]]''), non-sentient substance or matter (''[[pudgala]]''), principle of motion (''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]''), the principle of rest (''[[adharma]]'') and time (''[[kāla (time)|kāla]]'')

Akasha provides the space for other substances.&lt;ref&gt;http://nirgranth.in/6-dravya/&lt;/ref&gt; Akasha does not act as an obstruction. There are two types of Ākāśa: Lokakasha and Alokakasha. Alokakasha is beyond the Lokakasha and is empty; it has no other substance. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jainbelief.com/PPOJ/10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jainsamaj.org/content.php?url=Jainism_-_Jain_Cosmology:-_By&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Ākāśa is a compound word of Sanskrit language, wherein "ā" refers to "towards" and "kāśa" refers "to be visible or to appear".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=73983&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Akasha is the subtle “background” against which everything in the material universe becomes perceptible.{{sfn|Yogananda|2007|p=867}}

== Attributes ==
Space provides room to all other substances of the universe. The characteristic of space is to give room to or accommodate the other substances. The special feature of space is that it is not restricted to the universe like other substances but extends beyond the universe to the non-universe. 

Its qualities are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/6dravya.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*Provides room to soul, matter, medium of motion, and medium of rest
*Pervades everywhere (infinite)
*Supports everything and thus it is self supported
*Have no form, color, taste, smell, and touch
*Does not perform any active action (inactive)
*Provides accommodation to soul and matter of their actions
*Is one and whole

Sky and space both are different. We can see the sky because it is modification of the [[Pudgala]] whereas space is invisible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jainpushp.org/munishriji/ss-5-seven-tattava.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Akasha ==
[[File:Jain universe.JPG|thumb|300px|Structure of Universe according to the Jain scriptures.]]

Space substance is only one substance and as such it is indivisible (akhand).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atmadharma.com/shastras/laghujainsiddhant_eng_txt/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, universe (lokakasha) and non-universe (alokakasha) are considered its two divisions.
Space is divided into two parts:
*Lokakas - Where medium of motion and rest substances exist
*Alokakas - The remaining space, which is empty and void.
The dimension of Lokakasha is fourteen ''rajlok'' or ''rajju'', however Alokakasha is [[infinity|infinite]].&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/6dravya.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lokakasha===
That portion of space in which all the substances are found is called the universe (lokakash). There are three types of Lokakasha; a) Urdhwa Lok, where beings of higher qualities than us live (Siddha Lok where liberated souls stay is at the top of Urdhwalok), b) Madhya Lok - where human beings and other creatures live, and c) Adho Lok, where the inmates of hell live (it has seven layers).

At the summit of the ''lokākāśa'' is the ''[[Siddhashila]]'' (abode of the liberated souls).&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''dharma'' &amp; ''adharma'' ''dravyas'' are present only in ''Lokakasha'' and that is why  ''jiva'' and ''pudgal'' are also there in the ''Lokakasha'' only.&lt;ref&gt;http://jainascience.blogspot.in/2007/12/six-substancesdravyas-in-jain.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;http://mangitungi.org/JainismNScience.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alokakasha ===
The (empty) infinite space outside the universe is called the non-universe (alokakash). In the non-universe, space alone exists without the other five substances. Actually in non-universe there is nothing but space.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jainbooks/firstep-1/dravya.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Alokakash is perceptible only to the omniscient.
