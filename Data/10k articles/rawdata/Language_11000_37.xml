It is a case of [[vowel reduction]]. The most familiar example is probably [[vowel reduction in Russian|Russian akanye]] (pronounced but not represented orthographically in the standard language).

== Description ==
In Belarusian ''аканне'' (akanne),  both non-softened and softened {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} and other phonemes phonetically merge into [{{IPA link|a}}] in unstressed positions; see [[Belarusian phonology]].

In Russian ''а́канье'' (akan'ye), (except for [[Northern Russian dialects|Northern dialects]]), {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} phonetically merge in unstressed positions. If not preceded by a [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized (soft)]] consonant, these phonemes give [{{IPA link|ɐ}}] (sometimes also transcribed as {{IPA|[ʌ]}}) in the syllable immediately before the stress&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Padgett &amp; Tabain|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in absolute word-initial position.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jones &amp; Ward|1969|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other unstressed locations, non-softened {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} are further reduced towards a short, poorly enunciated [{{IPA link|ə}}].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philol.msu.ru/~fonetica/nn/n50.htm|title=Qualitative reduction of the 2nd degree|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialects without reduction of unstressed o are called ''okanye'' ({{lang-ru|о́канье}}), literally "''o''-ing".
After soft consonants, unstressed {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} are pronounced like [{{IPA link|ɪ}}] in most varieties of Russian (see [[vowel reduction in Russian]] for details); this reduction is not considered a manifestation of akanye. Unlike Belarusian akanne, Russian akanye does not affect softened vowels.

Slovene ''akanje'' may be partial (affecting only syllables before or after the stressed vowel) or complete (affecting all vowels in a word).&lt;ref name="Toporisic"/&gt; Examples from various Slovene dialects: ''domú'' → ''damú'' 'at home' (pretonic ''o''),&lt;ref name="Toporisic"/&gt; ''dnò'' → ''dnà'' 'bottom' (tonic ''o''),&lt;ref name="Ramovs"&gt;Ramovš, Fran. 1936. ''Kratka zgodovina slovenskega jezika. I.'' Ljubljana: Akademska založba, pp. 233–235.&lt;/ref&gt; ''léto'' → ''líəta'' (posttonic ''o''),&lt;ref name="Ramovs"/&gt; ''ne vém'' → ''na vém'' 'I don't know' (pretonic ''e''),&lt;ref name="Toporisic"/&gt; ''hléb'' → ''hlàb'' 'loaf' (tonic ''e''),&lt;ref name="Ramovs"/&gt; ''jêčmen'' → ''jèčman'' 'barley' (posttonic ''e'').&lt;ref name="Ramovs"/&gt;

[[File:Baruch Ber with talmidim.jpg|thumb|300px|Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz with his students]]
'''Boruch Ber Leibowitz''' (1862 &amp;ndash; November 17, 1939 (5 Kislev, 5700) ([[Hebrew]]: '''ברוך דוב (בער) לייבאוויץ''') was a prominent student of Rabbi [[Chaim Brisker]] and was famed for his [[Talmud]]ic lectures, particularly in that they were rooted styled in the method of his Rebbi, "Reb Chaim Brisker."

Leibowitz, often referred to by the informal 'Reb Boruch Ber', was born in [[Slutsk]] and was known as a [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] at a very young age. He was sent to learn in [[Volozhin yeshiva]], where he quickly attached himself to his main teacher, Reb Chaim Brisker, striving to completely adopt his unique Talmudic approach, which was the foundation of the popular [[Brisker method]].

He then married the daughter of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Zimmerman, whom he succeeded as Rabbi of Halusk. He also served as a pulpit Rabbi for other communities. In 1904 he was appointed head of the [[Kneseth Beis Yitzchak Yeshiva in Slobodka]]. During [[World War I]] he had to leave Slabodka and relocated the yeshiva to [[Minsk]] and then to [[Kremenchug]] and [[Vilnius|Vilna]]. In 1926 he re-established the yeshiva in [[Kamyanyets|Kaminetz]], where it continued to attract hundreds of students for the next 13 years. In 1939, shortly before his death, he fled with the yeshiva to a suburb of Vilna, hoping to escape from the [[Nazis]] and the communists. He is buried at the Zaretcha cemetery, Vilna. His grave was identified in 2012.

==Notable descendants==

Liebowitzs' grandson, Reb Chaim Shlomo Leibowitz, was one of the most prominent talmudic authorities in Jerusalem, as well as one of the leading Rabbis of the [[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]].

Leibowitzs' granddaughter married Rabbi [[Yitzchok Scheiner]].

==Works==

*''Birkas Shmuel'' (The Blessing of Shmuel), his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]], named in memory of his father, Shmuel David Leibowitz. This work includes many otherwise unrecorded teachings of Rabbi [[Chaim Brisker]] as well as Reb Baruch Ber's novel understandings of [[Torah]] topics on the [[Talmud]] published from his manuscripts by his nephew and longtime student, Rabbi Chaim Sholom Leibowitz.
*''Shiurei Reb Baruch Ber'' (Lectures of Reb Boruch Ber) - recorded and published by his students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2592">In [[computing]], a '''bucky bit''' is a [[bit]] in a binary representation of a character that is set by pressing on a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] [[modifier key]] other than the [[shift key]].

==Overview==
Setting a bucky bit changes the output character. A bucky bit allows the user to type a wider variety of characters and commands while maintaining a reasonable number of keys on a keyboard.

Some of the keys corresponding to bucky bits on modern keyboards are the [[alt key]], [[control key]], [[meta key]], [[command key]] (⌘), [[Super key (keyboard button)|super key]], and [[option key]].

In [[ASCII]], the bucky bit is usually the 8th bit (also known as [[meta key|meta]] bit). However, in older character representations wider than 8 bits, more high bits could be used as bucky bits. In the modern [[X Window System]], bucky bits are bits 18–23 of an event code.&lt;ref name="isbn1-56592-152-6"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was invented at [[Stanford]] and is based on [[Niklaus Wirth]]'s nickname "Bucky". Niklaus Wirth was first to suggest an '''EDIT''' key to set the eighth bit of a 7-bit ASCII character sometime in 1964 or 1965. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|page=128 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bucky bits were used heavily on keyboards designed by [[Tom Knight (scientist)|Tom Knight]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], including [[space-cadet keyboard]]s used on [[LISP machine]]s. These could contain as many as seven modifier keys: '''SHIFT''', '''CTRL''', '''META''', '''HYPER''', '''SUPER''', '''TOP''', and '''GREEK''' (also referred to as '''FRONT''').&lt;ref name="isbn1-56592-152-6"/&gt;

'''ClearForest ''' was an [[Israel]]i [[software company]] that developed and marketed [[text analytics]] and [[text mining]] solutions.  
==History==
Founded in 1998, ClearForest had its headquarters just outside [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Boston]] and a development center in [[Or Yehuda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000206300 ClearForest has developed text analysis solutions for business intelligence applications.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The company was acquired by Reuters in April, 2007.   It now markets its services under the names [[Calais (Reuters product)|Calais]], OpenCalais, and OneCalais.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10895">:''For others named Labeo, see [[Labeo (disambiguation)]]''

'''Cornelius Labeo''' was an [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman theologian]] and [[antiquarian]] who wrote on such topics as the [[Roman calendar]] and the teachings of [[Etruscan religion]] ''(Etrusca disciplina)''. His works survive only in fragments and ''[[wikt:testimonia|testimonia]].''
He has been dated "plausibly but not provably" to the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;C. Robert Phillips III, "Approaching Roman Religion: The Case for ''Wissenschaftsgeschichte''," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 15, citing ''HLL'' 4.78; Robert Lamberton, ''Homer the Theologian: Neoplatonist Allegorical Reading and the Growth of the Epic Tradition'' (University of California Press, 1986), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Labeo has been called "the most important Roman theologian" after [[Varro]], whose work seems to have influenced him strongly.&lt;ref&gt;Attilio Mastrocinque, "Creating One's Own Religion: Intellectual Choices," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; He is usually considered a [[Neoplatonist]].&lt;ref&gt;Mastrocinque, "Creating One's Own Religion," p. 384; R. Majercik, "Chaldean Triads in Neoplatonic Exegesis: Some Reconsiderations," ''Classical Quarterly'' 51.1 (2002), p. 291, note 119, citing P. Mastandrea, ''Un Neoplatonico Latino: Cornelio Labeone'' (Leiden, 1979), 127–34 and 193–8; Robert A. Kaster, ''Studies on the Text of Macrobius' Saturnalia'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 39; Lamberton, ''Homer the Theologian'', p. 249 (where he is ranked among "the Latin authors of greatest importance for the development of [[Platonism]] in [[late antiquity]]").&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeo and [[Censorinus]] are the only authors with demonstrable interests in writing about [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] during a time of "military anarchy" between the death of [[Caracalla]] and the [[Roman Emperor (Dominate)|accession]] of [[Diocletian]] when scholarship seems mostly to have ground to a halt.&lt;ref name="Approaching 15"&gt;Phillips, "Approaching Roman Religion," p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Because religious and civil law in ancient Rome may overlap, the  fragments of this Labeo are sometimes confused with those of the [[jurist]]s [[Quintus Antistius Labeo]] and [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]].

==Influence==
Labeo was among the sources used by [[Macrobius]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]], "The Palladium and the Pentateuch: Towards a Sacred Topography of the Later Roman Empire," ''Phoenix'' 55 (2001), pp. 402–403, and ''The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire'' (University of California Press, 2008), p. 193. [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]], ''The Last Pagans of Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 267, considers Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.17–23 as "nothing but a series of excerpts from Labeo."&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lydus]],&lt;ref name="Approaching 15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, ''The Last Pagans of Rome'', p. 268, noting that Lydus excerpted many of the same passages from Labeo as Macrobius did.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Servius]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, "Approaching Roman Religion," p. 15. Example at note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 3.168.&lt;/ref&gt; It has sometimes been supposed that the [[Orphic hymns|Orphic verses]] given by Macrobius in the first book of his ''Saturnalia'' are taken from Labeo.&lt;ref&gt;R. Delbrueck and W. Vollgraff, "An Orphic Bowl," ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 54 (1934), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; His works were influential enough that he was targeted for criticism by [[Church Father]]s&lt;ref name="Approaching 15"/&gt; such as [[Arnobius]]&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''[[De civitate Dei]]'' 2.11, 9.19.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been Arnobius's intermediate source for [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]],&lt;ref&gt;Majercik, "Chaldean Triads in Neoplatonic Exegesis," p. 291, note 119, citing Mastandrea, ''Un Neoplatonico Latino'', 127–34 and 193–8.&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly [[Martianus Capella]]'s for [[Iamblichus]].&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Capdeville, "Les dieux de Martianus Capella," ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' 213.3 (1996), p. 258, note 18, citing Robert Turcan, "Martianus Capella et Jamblique," ''REL'' 36 (1958) 235–254. On the difficulty of determining Macrobius's use of Labeo, see Danuta Shanzer, ''A Philosophical and Literary Commentary on Martianus Capella's ''De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'', Book 1'' (University of California Press, 1986), pp. 133–138, 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeo was interested in such problems as the existence of good and bad ''[[numen|numina]]'', and whether intermediate beings should be called ''daimones'' (δαίμονες) or ''angeloi'' (ἄγγελοι).&lt;ref name="Homer 250"&gt;Lambertson, ''Homer the Theologian'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Labeo is one of the Greek and Roman authors with whom Augustine debates over the nature of "demons" in Book 8, ''[[De civitate Dei|On the City of God]]''. In particular, he rejects Labeo's distinction between good and bad ''daimones'', saying they are all [[unclean spirit|impure spirits]] and thus evil.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De civitate Dei'' 2.11, 8.22, 3.25; Maijastina Kahlos, ''Debate and Dialogue: Christian and Pagan Cultures c. 360–430'' (Ashgate, 2007), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; In classifying divine figures as gods, demigods, and heroes, Labeo placed [[Plato]] among demigods such as [[Hercules]] and [[Romulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahlos, ''Debate and Dialogue'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''De mensibus'' ("On the months"), Lydus cites Labeo as his source for a list of thirty names for [[Aphrodite]] ([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]) and for explanations of customs pertaining to the calendar such as the etymologies of the names of the months.&lt;ref&gt;Lydus, ''De mensibus'' 1.21, 3.1.12, 3.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Labeo supported the view that the [[Maia (mythology)#Roman Maia|Roman goddess Maia]] was the Earth ''(Terra)'', named for her great size ''(magnitudine)'', to be identified with the Great Mother ([[Magna Mater]]) and the Good Goddess ([[Bona Dea]]), to whom a temple was dedicated on the [[Kalends]] of May.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik H.J. Brouwer, ''Bona Dea: The Sources and a Description of the Cult'' (Brill, 1989) p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apollo and Iao==
Labeo wrote a book ''De oraculo Apollinis Clarii'' that has provided a key passage for understanding [[monotheism|monotheistic]] tendencies in [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and Roman religious thought.&lt;ref&gt;Macobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.18.18–21; Polymnia Athanassiadi and Michael Frede, introduction to ''Pagan Monotheism in Late Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 16, citing ''Tübingen Theosophy'' 12.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked "Who is the supreme God?"&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.18.20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apollo]] responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Alas, you have not come to enquire about small matters.&lt;br&gt;You want to know who is the king of heaven&lt;br&gt;Whom even I do not know, yet revere according to tradition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Apollo says that the supreme God is superior to him, ineffable and unknowable. Labeo also reports that an interpretation was sought for the Orphic verse "[[Zeus]] is One, [[Hades]] is One, [[Helios]] is One, [[Dionysus]] is One." According to Macrobius:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The authority of this line rests on an oracle of Clarian Apollo, in which another name for the Sun, too, is added, who is given among other names, in the same holy lines, that of [[Tetragrammaton|Iao]]. For the Clarian Apollo, upon being asked which of the gods was meant by Iao, spoke as follows: "Initiates must hold their secrets—yet know! Iao is Hades in the winter, Zeus in spring, Helios in summer, and Iao in autumn." The force of this oracular saying, and the interpretation of the divinity and the name, whereby [[Liber|Father Liber]] and [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] are meant by Iao, Cornelius Labeo treats in his book titled ''On the Oracle of the Clarian Apollo''.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#18.19 1.18.19.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This passage has been called "the most far-reaching and prominent evidence for the concept of theocrasy in pagan antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''Judeophobia: Attitudes toward the Jews in the Ancient World'' (Harvard University Press, 1997, 1998), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; "Many gods," [[Ramsay MacMullen]] observed, "were really aspects of a single god."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ramsay MacMullen]], ''Paganism in the Roman Empire'' (Yale University Press, 1981), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; "Iao" (Ἰαώ) is not explicitly identified as the [[Yahweh|god of the Jews]], but the name was already established in Latin usage as such.&lt;ref&gt;The name of the Jewish god is first given as Iao by [[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Bibliotheca Historica'' 1.94.2 (1st century BC) and Varro (as preserved by Lydus, ''De mensibus'' 4.53). As a Jewish term it is attested by the [[Elephantine papyri|Aramaic papyri from Elephantine]] dating to the Persian period. Assumed to have become a ''vocabulum ineffabile'' for Jews, it occurs in a fragment of the [[Septuagint]] version of [[Leviticus]] probably dating to the 1st century BC, but it does not occur in the ''textus receptus'' of the [[Septuagint]]. The name is ubiquitous in magic texts from all over the [[Greco-Roman world]], an indication that it had passed out of "official" usage and become popularized by [[syncretism]]. See Peter Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'' pp. 53, 232, and Hugo Rahner, ''Greek Myths and Christian Mystery'' (Burns &amp; Oak, 1963, reprinted 1971, originally published 1957 in German), p. 146, citing also R. Ganschinietz, "Jao," in ''RE'' 9, col. 708, 1–33. See also John Granger Cook, ''The Interpretation of the Old Testament in Greco-Roman Paganism'' (Mohr Siebeck, 2004), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Labeo tried to find a way to situate the Jewish god in the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian system]].&lt;ref name="Homer 250"/&gt; In [[late antiquity]], "Iao" has a "magical potency" that came to embody the unifying tendency of [[Neopythagoreanism]] and [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The most extensive treatment of Cornelius Labeo, including the collected fragments, is that of the Italian scholar P. Mastandrea, ''Un Neoplatonico Latino: Cornelio Labeone, testimonianze e frammenti'' (Leiden, 1979). English translation of the fragments appears in [https://archive.org/stream/JohnLydusOnTheMonthsTr.Hooker2ndEd.2017/ Hooker (tr.), ''John Lydus: On the Months'' (2017)], pp. 200-205.

The work ''Peri keraunôn (Περὶ κεραυνῶν, On Lightnings)'' has sometimes been wrongly ascribed to him.&lt;ref&gt;"Wrongly" as noted by [[Stefan Weinstock]], "Libri fulgurales," ''Papers of the British School at Rome'' 19 (1951), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Accous-ObeliscDesporrins.jpg|thumb|Accous obelisk]]
'''Cyprien Despourrins''' (in [[Occitan]]: ''Ciprian Desporrins'') was an Occitan-language poet from [[Béarn]] and member of the [[Bigorre]] Parliament born in [[Accous]] in 1698.

Many of his poems (written in [[Béarnese dialect]]) are famous traditional folk songs from Béarn and 18th century opera singer [[Pierre Jélyotte]] interpreted some of them for the mistress of the King of France [[Mme de Pompadour]] and the Royal Court.

Despourrins died in [[Argelès-Gazost]] in 1759.

An obelisk dedicated to Despourrins stands in his town of birth, Accous, on which are inscribed two poems; one written by Béarnese poet [[Xavier Navarrot]], and one written by Gascon poet [[Jacques Jasmin|Jasmin]].

[[File:Dinabandhu Mitra (1830-1873).jpg|thumb|Dinabandhu Mitra]]
'''Dinabandhu Mitra''' ({{lang-bn|দীনবন্ধু মিত্র}}) (1829–1873) the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] dramatist, was born in 1829 at village Chouberia in Gopalnagar P.S., [[North 24 Parganas district|North 24 Parganas]] and was the son of Kalachand Mitra. His given name was Gandharva Narayan, but he changed it to Dinabandhu Mitra.

==Early life==
Dinabandhu Mitra's education started at a village pathshala. His father arranged a job for him on a [[zamindar]]'s estate (1840). But the small boy fled to Kolkata, where he started working in the house of his uncle, [[Nilmani Mitra]]. Around 1846, he was admitted to the free school run by [[James Long (Anglican priest)|James Long]]. Dinabandhu was a bright student and won a number of scholarships. In 1850, he enrolled in [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Hindu College]] and was awarded scholarships for academic excellence. However, he did not appear in his last examination, and, instead, started working as a postmaster in Patna (1855). He served in various posts in the Postal Department in [[Krishnanagar, Nadia]], [[Dhaka]] and Orissa. In 1870, he was made supernumerary post- master in [[Serampore|Serampore Head Post Office- 712201]] In 1872, he joined the [[Indian Railway]] as an inspector. He wrote the play called neel darpan (indigo mirror).

==Literary career==
Dinabandhu started writing literary pieces while still at college. His poetic style was inspired by the well-known poet [[Ishwar Chandra Gupta]]. His poems were able to attract the attention of intellectuals at [[kolkata]], but his favourite [[genre]] was the drama. His work in the postal department had taken him to various parts of the country  giving him opportunities to study human life closely and thereby adding to his ability to unfold the drama of life with a degree of realism unknown at that time. Among his books of [[poems]] are Suradhuni Kavya (first part appeared in 1871, second part appeared in 1876), Dvadash Kavita (1872). His plays include Nildarpan (1860), Nabin Tapasvini (1863), Biye Pagla Budo (1866), Sadhabar Ekadashi (1866), Lilavati (1867), Jamai Barik (1873)and Kamale Kamini (1873). He also wrote a novel titled Poda Mahehshvar. Another one of his noted contributions was the hilarious - Jamalaye Jibanta Manush (An Alive man in the abode of Yama), the basic story line will later be adopted into an iconic film [[Jamalaye Jibanta Manush|In the same name]] starring [[Bhanu Bandopadhyay]] and [[Basabi Nandi]]. It has to be noted that Mitra was also a pioneer in the sense that his plays focused on humans rather than gods &amp; goddesses. Also in Jamalay-e he involves popular Hindu gods to generate humour, which would later be done by [[Rajshekhar Basu]] too.

==Nildarpan==
Dinabandhu is, however, primarily known for his play about the plight of [[indigo]] farmers [[Nil Darpan]]. The Indigo Revolt (1858) or [[Nilbidraha]] in Bengali was the revolt of the [[indigo]] farmers against the indigo planters. It was just one year after the [[Sepoy Revolt]] Bengal saw one more important revolt in its history.

Mitra stormed the social and the literary circle of [[Bengal]] by his most notable play [[Nildarpan]] in the year 1860. It was published from [[Dhaka]] and soon after its publication it ignited a major argument in the newspapers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dinabandhu Mitra, Ajit Kumar Ghoshal, [[Shahitya Academy Publication]]&lt;/ref&gt; His first hand experience of the indigo cultivators, while on the job as the post master in rural Orissa and Bengal, were reflected in the drama.
[[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]] translated the play into English immediately after it was published .&lt;ref&gt;. Prothom Alo, [[Sunil Ganguli]], [[Ananda Publishers]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Reverend James Long published it. The [[Nildarpan]] got wide publicity in [[Europe]] where it was translated into many other languages. No other Bengali book at that time got so wide publicity at such large scale.It was so emotionally motivating that when it was playing on the stage Chandra Vidyasagar threw a shoe to the actor who was playing the role of planter &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A lawsuit was filed against Rev. Long by 19 July 1861 for libeling the editor of the [[englishman]] and libeling the indigo planters. Rev. Long was fined a sum of 1000 [[Rs.]] and a month of time in jail, the fully packed court house were full with sympathy towards the Rev. and the dramatist. The fined sum was paid at the spot by another legend of [[Bengal Renaissance]] [[Kaliprasanna Sinha]].&lt;ref&gt;Dinabandhu Mitra, Ajit Kumar Ghoshal, {{ISBN|81-260-0546-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court hearing against the indigo planters went for the next four years. Nildarpan  was so emotionally motivating that when the play was staged, the notable educator and reformer [[Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar]] was so taken in by the realism of the performance of Ardhendushekhar Mustafi, the actor playing the role of the indigo planter Mr Wood that he [[list of shoe throwing incidents|threw a shoe]] at the actor. The actor accepted the shoe as a compliment.&lt;ref name="banglapedia.com"&gt;http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mitra,_Rai_Bahadur_Dinabandhu&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay]] compared [[Nildarpan]] to [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] for its role in arousing people's awareness of the evils of [[indigo]] plantations.&lt;ref name="banglapedia.com"/&gt; It played an important role in the [[Nilbidraha]].

==Later life and death==
Dinabandhu was awarded the title 'Rai Bahadur' by the British government for services rendered at the Battle of Lushai. He died on 1 November 1873.

The college [[Dinabandhu Mahavidyalay]] (estd. 1947) is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dinabandhumahavidyalaya.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=27 Dinabandhu Mahavidyalay History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708001238/http://dinabandhumahavidyalaya.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=27 |date=2012-07-08 }} College official website.

The term '''fellow traveller''' (also '''fellow traveler''') identifies a person who is intellectually sympathetic to the ideology of a political organization, and who co-operates in the organization's politics, without being a formal member of that organization.&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, Alan; Trombley, Stephen, Editors (1999), ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early history of the [[Soviet Union]], the Bolshevik revolutionary [[Trotsky]] coined the term ''poputchik'' ('one who travels the same path') to identify the vacillating intellectual supporters of the [[Bolshevik]] régime. Likewise for the political characterisation of the Russian ''[[intelligentsia|intelligentsiya]]'' (writers, academics, and artists) who were philosophically sympathetic to the political, social, and economic goals of the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, but who chose to not join the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Moreover, during the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] régime, the usage of the term ''poputchik'' disappeared from political discourse in the Soviet Union, but the [[Western world]] adopted the English term ''fellow traveller'' to identify people who sympathised with the Soviets and with [[Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, Alan; Trombley, Stephen, Editors (1999), ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[U.S. politics]], during the 1940s and the 1950s, the term ''fellow traveler'' was a pejorative term for a person who was philosophically sympathetic to [[Communism]], yet was not a formal, "[[Card-carrying Communist|card-carrying member]]" of the [[American Communist Party]]. In political discourse, the term ''fellow traveler'' was applied to intellectuals, academics, and politicians who lent their names and prestige to [[Communist front]] organizations.

In European politics, the equivalent terms for ''fellow traveller'' are: ''Compagnon de route'',  ''sympathisant'', and ''progressiste'' in France; ''Weggenosse'' and ''Sympathisant'' in Germany; and ''compagno di viaggio'' in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Caute, David. ''The Fellow-travellers: Intellectual Friends of Communism'' (1988) p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==European usages==
===USSR===
In 1917, after the Russian Revolution, the [[Bolsheviks]] applied the term '''''Poputchik''''' ("one who travels the same path") to Russian writers who accepted the revolution, but who were not active revolutionaries. In the book ''Literature and Revolution'' (1923), [[Leon Trotsky]] popularized the usage of ''Poputchik'' as a political descriptor attributed to the pre-Revolutionary [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (the Social Democrats) to identify a vacillating political sympathizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trotskii |first1=L. |title=Literatura i revoliutsiia |year=1991 |origyear=1923 |publisher=Politizdat |location=Moscow |isbn=5-250-01431-3 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 2, "The Literary 'Fellow-Travellers' of the Revolution", Trotsky said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Between bourgeois Art, which is wasting away either in repetitions or in silences, and the new art which is as yet unborn, there is being created a transitional art, which is more or less organically connected with the Revolution, but which is not, at the same time, the Art of the Revolution. [[Boris Pilnyak]], [[Vsevolod Ivanov]], [[Nikolai Tikhonov (writer)|Nicolai Tikhonov]], the [[Serapion Brothers|Serapion Fraternity]], [[Yesenin]] and his group of [[Imagists]] and, to some extent, [[Nikolai Klyuev|Kliuev]] – all of them were impossible without the Revolution, either as a group or separately. ... They are not the artists of the proletarian Revolution, but her artist "fellow-travellers", in the sense in which this word was used by the old Socialists ...

As regards a "fellow-traveller", the question always comes up – How far will he go? This question cannot be answered in advance, not even approximately. The solution of it depends, not so much on the personal qualities of this or that "fellow-traveller", but mainly on the objective trend of things during the coming decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/lit_revo/ch02.htm Leon Trotsky, ''Literature and Revolution'', Chapter 2] Cnn.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nazi Germany===
In the aftermath of the Second World War (1939–45), the Russian term ''poputchik'' (fellow traveller) was translated to the German as ''[[Mitläufer]]'', to identify the person who, although not formally charged with participation in [[war crime]]s, was sufficiently involved with the Nazi régime to the extent that the Allied authorities responsible for the [[denazification]] of Germany could not legally exonerate him or her from association with the [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ott|first=Hugo|title=Martin Heidegger: A Political Life|year=1993|publisher=Harper Collins|location=London|isbn=0 00 215399 8|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
For the term ''fellow traveller'', the [[reactionary]] [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Régime of the Colonels]] (1967–74) used the Greek word ''Synodiporia'' ("The ones walking the street together") as an [[umbrella term]] that described domestic Greek Leftists and democratic opponents of the military dictatorship; likewise, the military government used term ''Diethnis'' ("international ''Synodiporia''") to identify the foreign supporters of the domestic anti-fascist Greeks.

==American usages==
===Pre-World War II U.S.===
In the U.S., the European term ''fellow-traveller'' was adapted to describe persons politically sympathetic to, but  not members of, the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]] (CPUSA), who shared the political perspectives of [[Communism]]. In the 1920s and 1930s, the political, social, and economic problems in the U.S. and throughout the world, caused partly by the [[Great Depression |Great Economic Depression]], motivated [[Idealism|idealistic]] young people, [[artist]]s, and [[intellectual]]s to become sympathetic to the Communist cause, in hope they could overthrow [[capitalism]]. To that end, Black Americans joined the American Communist Party (1919) because some of their [[Liberalism |politically liberal]] stances (e.g. legal [[racial equality]]) corresponded to the political struggles of Black people for [[civil rights]] and [[social justice]], in the time when [[Jim Crow laws]] established and maintained [[Racial segregation in the United States |racial segregation]] throughout the United States.  Moreover, the American League for Peace and Democracy (ALPD) was the principal socio-political group who actively worked towards peace by way of [[anti-fascism]] rather than by [[pacifism]]; as such, the ALPD was the most important organization within the [[Popular Front]], a pro-Soviet coalition of anti-fascist political organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Rossinow (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

As in Europe, in the 1920s and 1930s, the intellectuals of the U.S. either sympathized with or joined the U.S. Communist Party, to oppose the economic excesses of capitalism and [[fascism]], which they perceived as its political form. In 1936, the newspaper columnist [[Max Lerner]] included the term ''fellow traveler'' in the article "Mr. Roosevelt and His Fellow Travelers" (''The Nation'').  In 1938, [[J. B. Matthews|Joseph Brown Matthews Sr.]] featured the term in the title of his political biography ''Odyssey of a Fellow Traveler'' (1938); later, J. B. Matthews was the chief investigator for the anti-Communist activities of the [[HUAC]] (House Un-American Activities Committee ).&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Nelson L. "From Fellow Traveler to Anticommunist: The Odyssey of J.B. Matthews", ''The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society'' (1986) pp. 280–306 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23381085 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, among the writers and intellectuals known as fellow travelers were [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Theodore Dreiser]] novelists whose works of fiction occasionally were critical of capitalism and its excesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Fellows Who Traveled| publisher = Time Magazine | date = 2 February 1962 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,829020-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [[John Dos Passos]], a known left-winger, moved to the [[Right wing |right-wing]] and became a staunch [[Anti-Communism|anti-Communist]].&lt;ref&gt;Kallich, Martin Kallich. "John Dos Passos Fellow-Traveler: A Dossier with Commentary", ''Twentieth Century Literature'' (1956) 1#4 pp. 173–90. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/440907 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the editor of ''The New Republic'' magazine,  [[Malcolm Cowley]] had been a fellow traveler during the 1930s, but broke from the Communist Party, because of the ideological contradictions inherent to the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]] (Treaty of Non-aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 23 August 1939).&lt;ref&gt;Johnpoll, Bernard K. ''A Documentary History of the Communist Party of the United States'' (Vol. 3, 1994) p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist and critic [[Waldo Frank]] was a fellow traveler during the mid-1930s, and was the chairman of the League of American Writers, in 1935, but was ousted as such, in 1937, when he called for an impartial enquiry to the reasons for Josef Stalin's [[Great purge |purges]] (1936–38) of Russian society.&lt;ref&gt;Johnpoll, Bernard K. Ed., ''A Documentary History of the Communist Party of the United States'' (Vol. 3, 1994) p 502&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1934 to 1939, the historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] briefly was a member of the [[Young Communist League USA]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Susan Stout. ''Radical Beginnings: Richard Hofstadter and the 1930s'' (1985), pp. 65, 84, 89–90, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite disillusionment because of the non-aggression pact between [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union |Communist Russia]] and the ideological rigidity of the Communist party-line, Hofstadter remained a fellow traveler until the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Susan Stout. ''Radical Beginnings: Richard Hofstadter and the 1930s'' (1985), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World'' (2003), [[Eric Foner]] said that Hofstatdter continued thinking of himself as a [[political radicalism |political radical]], because his opposition to capitalism was the reason he had joined the American Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book| first =Eric | last = Foner|title=Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3I-Z8KW5REC&amp;pg=PT38|year=2003|publisher= Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|page= 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in the elegiac article "The Revolt of the Intellectuals" (''Time'' 6 Jan. 1941), the ex-Communist [[Whittaker Chambers]] satirically used the term ''fellow traveler'':
{{Quotation |As the Red Express hooted off into the shades of a closing decade, ex-fellow travelers rubbed their bruises, wondered how they had ever come to get aboard. … With the exception of [[Granville Hicks]], probably none of these people was a [[Communism|Communist]]. They were fellow travelers who wanted to help fight [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Chambers | first = Whittaker  | authorlink =  | title = The Revolt of the Intellectuals | publisher = Whittakerchambers.org | date = 6 January 1941 | url = http://www.whittakerchambers.org/timemagazine.html | accessdate = 17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Post-World War II U.S.===
In the late 1930s, most fellow-travelers broke with the Communist party-line of Moscow when Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|German–Soviet Non-aggression Pact]] (August 1939), which allowed the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)]] for partitioning between the U.S.S.R. and Nazi Germany. In the U.S., the American Communist Party abided Stalin's official party-line, and denounced Britain and Western anti-Nazis, rather than the German Nazis, as war mongers. In June 1941, when the Nazis launched ''[[Operation Barbarossa]]'', to annihilate the U.S.S.R., again, the American Communist Party abided Stalin's party-line, and became war hawks for American intervention to the European war in aid of Russia, and ally of the United States.

At War's end, the Russo–American [[Cold War]] emerged in the 1946–48 period, and American Communists found themselves at the political margins of U.S. society – such as being forced out of the leadership of trade unions; in turn, membership to the Communist Party of the U.S.A. declined. Yet, in 1948, American Communists did campaign for the presidential run of [[Henry A. Wallace]], President F. D. Roosevelt's vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamby |first1=Alonzo L. | authorlink = Alonzo Hamby |title=Henry A. Wallace, the Liberals, and Soviet–American relations|journal=Review of Politics |date=1968 |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=153–169 |jstor=1405411}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1956, to the 20th congress of the C.P.S.U., [[Nikita Khrushchev]] delivered the secret speech, ''[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]'', denouncing [[Stalinism]] and the [[cult of personality]] for Josef Stalin; those political revelations ended the ideological relationship between many fellow-travelers in the West and the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet version of Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Archie |title=The Rise and Fall of Communism |date=2009 |pages=240–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====McCarthyism====
In 1945, the anti-Communist HUAC ([[House Un-American Activities Committee#Standing committee .281945.E2.80.931975.29|House Committee on Un-American Activities]]) became a permanent committee of the U.S. Congress; and, in 1953, after Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] became chairman of the [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations#Joseph McCarthy|Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]], they attempted to determine the extent of Soviet influence in the U.S. government, and in the social, cultural, and political institutions of American society.

That seven-year period (1950–56) of [[moral panic]] and political [[witch hunt]]s was the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Era]]  of right-wing political orthodoxy realised by way of anonymous and unfounded accusations of [[treason]] and [[subversion]], during which time the political pejorative ''fellow traveler'' was applied against any American citizen who did not fit or abide the HUAC's ideologically narrow definition of "American" – which contradicted, flouted, and voided the political rights provided for every citizen in the [[U.S. Constitution]].

In the course of his political career, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Sen. McCarthy claimed there were many American citizens (secretly and publicly) sympathetic to Communism and the U.S.S.R., who worked in the State Department and in the U.S. Army; likewise, that there were many secret Communists working in [[Academy|universities]] and in the businesses of the mass-communications media (publishing, radio, cinema, television) promoting "un-American" ideals, e.g. [[civil liberties]], [[racial equality]], opposition to [[book censorship]], [[public health services]], [[vaccination]], [[Mental health|mental health-care services]] and [[fluoridation]], which were believed to be Communist plots to subvert U.S. society. In response to such ideological threats to the national security of the U.S., American citizens suspected of being "un-American" were secretly and anonymously registered to a [[blacklist]], and so denied employment and the right to earn a living, despite many such ex-communists having transcended the ''fellow traveler'' stage of their political lives, e.g. the [[Hollywood blacklist]].

;Types of fellow traveller
In ''Masters of Deceit: The Story of Communism in America and How to Fight It'' (1958), FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, defined five types of "fellow traveler", as politically [[Subversion|subversive]] persons who he believed meant to promote the Communist deposition of the U.S. government:

# The ''[[card-carrying Communist]]'', who is a member of the American Communist party
# The ''underground Communist'', who hides his or her membership in the Communist party
# The ''Communist sympathizer'', who is a potential communist, because he or she holds Communist political views
# The ''fellow traveler'', who is someone who is sympathetic to Communism, but is neither an influential advocate of Communism, nor a potential Communist
# The ''dupe'', is a man or a woman who obviously is not a Communist, or a potential Communist, but whose politics enable Communist subversion, e.g. .a prominent religious leader who advocates [[pacifism]] or [[civil rights]] for minority groups (racial, religious, etc.), and who opposes [[Red-baiting]] as an illegal abridgement of the citizens' [[civil and political rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hoover
|first = J. Edgar| title = Masters of Deceit: The Story of Communism in America and How to Fight It| publisher = Kessinger Publishing| year=1958| isbn = 1-4254-8258-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary usages==
''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (1999), defines the term ''fellow-traveller'' as a post-revolutionary political term derived from the Russian word ''poputchik'', with which the Bolsheviks described political sympathizers who hesitated to publicly support the Bolshevik Party and Communism in Russia, after the Revolution of 1917.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition. 199. p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' (1993) defines the term ''fellow-traveller'' as "a non-Communist who sympathizes with the aims and general policies of the Communist Party"; and, by transference, as a "person who sympathizes with, but is not a member of another party or movement".&lt;ref&gt;''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' (1993), p. 931.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Safire's Political Dictionary'' (1978), defines the term ''fellow traveller'' as a man or a woman "who accepted most Communist doctrine, but was not a member of the Communist party"; and, in contemporary usage, defines the term ''fellow traveller'' as a person "who agrees with a philosophy or group, but does not publicly work for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|  last = Safire|  first = William|  title = Safire's Political Dictionary|  publisher = Random House|  date =1978| ISBN = 0-394-50261-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ghadamès''' ([[Berber languages|Berber]]: ''Ɛdimes'', {{IPA-xx|ʕdimes|}} or ''Ɣdames'', {{IPA-xx|Ɣdames|}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: غدامس, {{IPA-ar|ɣadaːmes|}}) is a [[Berber language]] that is spoken in the oasis town of [[Ghadames]] in [[Nalut District]], [[Libya]].

==Research==
Ghadamès language materials have been gathered by two linguists. The first materials were published in 1903 and 1904 by Adolphe de Calassanti Motylinski (1854–1907). A more copious and reliable source is provided by the works of White Father Jacques Lanfry, who stayed in Ghadames from 1944 to 1945 and who published his main works in 1968 and 1973. No new research has been undertaken on location since then. Recently, Kossmann (2013) has published a modern grammar of Ghadamès based on Lanfry’s materials.

==Number of speakers==
Lanfry mentions the number of c. 4,000 speakers as an optimistic estimate.&lt;ref&gt;Lanfry (1973:iv).&lt;/ref&gt; The actual number of speakers is not known with certainty. ''Ethnologue'' cites a number of c. 10,000 speakers in 2006, with another 2,000 living outside the area. However, the number of 10,000 reflects the total number of inhabitants of Ghadames, who are not all native speakers of Ghadamès. In addition, the number of 2,000 emigrant speakers is based on a very old source.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd edition, article ''Ghadāmis'' (1952): 2,000 persons with a background in Ghadames living in Tunis; quoted by Lanfry (1973:iv).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ethnologue'' classifies the language as 6b (Threatened).

==The language==
Ghadamès is a [[Berber language]] on its own, preserving several unique phonological and morphological features, and the Ghadamès lexicon, as recorded by Lanfry, shows relatively little influence from Arabic. There is as yet no consensus on the classification of Ghadamès within the Berber language group. Aikhenvald and Militarev (1984) group it as [[Eastern Berber languages|Eastern Berber]], and Kossmann (1999) specifically groups it together with [[Awjila language|Awjila]]. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' classifies it as East [[Zenati languages|Zenati]].

==Phonology==
;Consonants
Like other Berber languages and Arabic, Ghadamès has both [[Pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] ("emphatic") and plain dental consonants. [[Gemination]] is contrastive. Consonants listed between brackets occur only very sporadically.

The '''Gta’ language''' (also rendered Gataʔ, Gataq, Getaq, Getaʔ, Gtaʔ, Gata and also known as Gta Asa, Didei/Didayi [ɖiɖaːj(i)], Dire) is a [[language]] spoken by the [[Didayi]] people of [[India]]. It is notable for its [[sesquisyllabic]] phonology (Anderson 2008:684-5) and [[vigesimal]] numeral system.

==Demographics==
Gta’ is spoken by 3,000 people primarily in [[Malkangiri district]], [[Odisha]] as well as adjoining areas of [[Koraput district]] (Anderson 2008:682).

''Ethnologue'' reports the following locations.
*[[Odisha]] (47 villages): Kudumulgumma block and Chitrakonda block of [[Koraput district]] and [[Malkangiri district]], south of [[Bondo Hills]]; some in Khairput block
*[[East Godavari district]], [[Andhra Pradesh]]

==Dialects==
Gta’ has two main varieties, namely Plains Gta’ and Hill Gta’.

==Classification==
The Gta’ language belongs to the South Munda subgroup of the [[Munda languages|Munda]] branch of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language family]].&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; Within South Munda, Gta’ is generally considered to be the first branch off a node that also subsumes the [[Bonda language|Remo]] and [[Gutob language|Gutob]] languages; this subgroup of South Munda is known as Gutob–Remo–Gataq. It is phonologically and morphologically divergent within that branch (Zide 1976).

==Grammar==

===Nouns===
Nouns in Gta? ordinarily have two forms, one a free full form, the other a bound short form. These latter occur only when the noun is compounded with some other stem for derivational 9 purposes, and are hence labeled "combining forms". Combining forms occurring with verb stems can be echoed independently of the verb stems; those occur? ring with noun stems either remain intact or change at par with the main stems.
&lt;br /&gt;
''Examples''
&lt;br /&gt;
Type 1: sur-cu ''to fry in oil'' &gt; sur-ca, sur-ci, sar-ca, s?r-cf, sar-cu. 
		&lt;br /&gt;
gag-bo? ''to tie onto the head''
			&lt;br /&gt;
gag-ba?, gig-bT?, gag-bT?, gTg-ba?, gig-bo?. 
		&lt;br /&gt;
"tur-t?a ''to graze cattle'' &gt; 
			&lt;br /&gt;
tar-ti, t?r-ti, tar-t?a, t?r-t?a.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Type 2: kula-re ''kinsman'' &gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
ka I a-re, k?I i-re. 
&lt;br /&gt;

===Echo Formation===
'''Rules of Formation'''
&lt;br /&gt;
''Rule#''  1. Echo-words are formed by changing only the vowels of the base word.

''Rule#''  2. The echo-word must differ from the base word. The vowel of univocalic base words is reflected as either /a/ or /}/ in the echo-word. For base-word /u, e, o/ the vowel /a/ is preferred, while for base word /e/ the vowel /I/ is preferred.

''Rule#''  3. The vowels of disyllabic base words are reflected in the echo-word as follows: 
*a. Both vowels are reflected as either /a/ or /?/; or 
*b. Only one of the base-word vowels is reflected as /a/ or /]/ while the other is reflected unchanged; or 
*c. The first vowel (Vl) changes to /u/ while the second (V^) changes to /a/.
''Rule#''  4. In the case of trisyllabic base words, one, two or all three of the vowels (in adjacent syllables) are reflected as either /a/ or /}/.

''Rule#''  5. The echo-forms of compound words, irrespective of their vocalic structure, are derived as follows: 
*a. In the case of compound verbs consisting of two verb stems, one or both stems undergo change, depending on their relationship with each other; 
*b. Nominal combining forms occurring with verb stems change independently; those attached to noun stems change only at par with the main stem. 
*c. In verbal constructions incorporating a prefix, both the prefix and the stem change as a unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahapatra|first1=K.|title=Echo Formation in Gta?|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/mahapatra1976echo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categories of Echo Forms===
#A-forms, indicating gross variety;
#I-forms, indicating diminutive or tender variety ;
#U/a-forms, indicating variety different from a related category
#Partially changed forms, indicating inferior variety : a-forms, indicating grossness and ?-forms, indicating tenderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahapatra|first1=K.|title=Echo Formation in Gta?|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/mahapatra1976echo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neighboring Languages==
Gta? echo-formation shows some striking similarities with echo-formation in neighboring Munda languages such as Remo and Gorum as well as in the Desia dialect of Oriya spoken in the Koraput Munda region.The most conspicuous feature they have in common with Gta? is that echo-words in all three of these languages are also derived from base words by changes in the vowels alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahapatra|first1=K.|title=Echo Formation in Gta?|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/mahapatra1976echo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3342">A '''hotwash''' is the immediate "after-action" discussions and evaluations of an agency's (or multiple agencies') performance following an exercise, training session, or major event, such as [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/9/4/111442/8437 |title=Katrina: Hotwash vs. Whitewash |publisher=TPMCafe |accessdate=2007-11-29 |date=2004-09-04 |author=Johnson, Larry}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purpose of a hotwash session is to identify strengths and weaknesses of the response to a given event, which then leads to another governmental phase known as "lessons learned," which is intended to guide future response direction in order to avoid repeating errors made in the past. A hotwash normally includes all the parties that participated in the exercise or response activities. These events are used to create the [[After Action Review]].

''Hotwash'' is a term picked up in recent years by the Emergency Preparedness Community, likely as a result of [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] and other government agencies' involvement in disaster planning. It serves as a form of after-disaster briefing for all parties involved to analyze what worked well, what needs improvement, what person or agency needs to be responsible for said improvements, and the assignments and timelines for the noted corrective and proactive improvements to be in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/watersecurity/tools/trainingcd/trainers/AA_Reviews.pdf|title=How to Conduct an After Action Review a.k.a.(The 'Hot Wash')|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2014-07-17|author=unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The term ''hotwash'' originated in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]:
{{quote|text=The term Hot Wash comes from the practice used by some soldiers of dousing their weapons in extremely hot water as a means of removing grit and residue after firing.  While this practice by no means eliminates the need to properly break down the weapon later for cleaning, it removes the major debris and ensures the cleaning process goes more smoothly.  One infantry soldier described it as “the quick and dirty cleaning that can save a lot of time later.|sign=Safe Schools Newsletter|source=[http://www.dodea.edu/Offices/Safety/upload/11_7.pdf US Department of Defense Education Activity]}}

It is also commonly used in the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] and other seagoing services to describe the use of a fine spray mist of water and lubricants to prevent corrosion in helicopter turbines operated in a heavily saltwater-saturated marine environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.mdhelicopters.com/ETM/pdf/500storage/letters/fl004.pdf|title=TRI–FLOW WASH PROCEDURE – MAIN ROTOR HUB|publisher=Hughes Helicopters, Inc.|accessdate=2014-04-09|date=1985-03-01|author=Edward Koch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142623/http://download.mdhelicopters.com/ETM/pdf/500storage/letters/fl004.pdf|archive-date=2014-04-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indra Bahadur Khare''' (16 December 1922 – 13 April 1953) was an Indian [[Hindi]]-language poet, a participant in Kavi-Sammelan, and a professor of 20th century [[Hindi literature]].

==Personal life and education==
Born in the village of [[Gadarwara]], [[Narsinghpur]] district in [[Madhya Pradesh]], Khare developed a taste for literature at a very young age. He received his primary school education at [[Sohagpur]], Itarasi and from [[Katni]] in Madhya Pradesh. He received his middle school education at [[Mahoba]] [[Uttar Pradesh]] and his secondary school education at Kishori Raman Vidyalay Mathura, Uttar Pradesh. He then entered the [[University of Allahabad]] where he studied for a BA, living at the Shyam Sundar Hostel. Because of financial constraints, he was unable to complete his education at the time. After working odd jobs in [[Jabalpur]] he attended Hitkarini City College there and completed his BA. In 1949 he joined the college as a professor.

In 1946 he married Vidyawati Shrivastav, a school teacher who had an  MA Degree in [[Sanskrit]] and M Ed. She was a teacher for more than thirty years and got blessed with three children namely Amiya Ranjan Khare, Khanjan Sinha, and Dr. Malaya Ranjan Khare.

==Research work on Khare==
In the late 2000s, those interested in Hindi literature began to rediscover Khare's writings. They began to be regarded as a valuable contribution to the world of Hindi literature. Currently, there are students across the India doing research on the Khare's contributions to Hindi literature.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Ms Bhavna Sharma at [[Rani Durgavati University]], Jabalpur researched her work from 1993 to 1997 under the guidance of Hindi writer Dr. Sushma Dubey.

==Collections==
'''List of works (Kavita, Kahaani, Upanyaas and Music CDs)'''

'''Kavita'''

One of Khare's first books was ''Bhor ke geet''(भोर के गीत) written between 1939-1942 at the age of 18. The book was later re-printed by Vani Prakashan Book Publishers in New Delhi in 2009. The book's publication was celebrated by parliamentarian [[Balram Jakhar|Shri Balram Jakhar]], former governor of Madhya-Pradesh, on 20 April 2009.  The book is widely available for Hindi readers within India and is in libraries at MGI [[Mauritius]] and [[North Carolina State University]], USA. In 2015 ''Bhor ke Geet Sameeksha pustak'' was released by Arunoday Prakashan, New Delhi.({{ISBN|81-88473-24-3}})

At the age of 20, 25 Jan 1943  he had written a poem ' Hemu Kalani' just after his hanging 21 Jan 1943, and it is published in 2017 after a span of 74 years.
At the age of 23, Khare wrote another well known title, ''Vijan ke Phool''(विजन के फूल), between 1944 and 1946. The book was originally published in 1955 by Jabalpur Sahitya Sangh. In 2011, this book, as well as ''Surbala'', written between 1943–44, was re-published by Vani Prakashan Book Publishers. On 5 May 2011, the books were celebrated by Shri Rameshawar Thakur.

''Rajani ke pal'', another poetic collection, was written between 1941 and 1942. Vani Prakashan re-published the title in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bibliaimpex.com/index.php?p=sr&amp;Uc=60769&amp;l=0 | title=Rajani ke pal | publisher=bibliaimpex.com | accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Khare's collections is ''Azaadee ke pahle Azaadee ke baad'' highlighting pre- and post-Independence India. It is a collection of more than 120 poems highlighting the struggle for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]]. Some 14,000+ school students in [[Bhilai|Bhilai, Chhattisgarh]], and a few thousands nationwide sing the lines of Shri Khare song "Par Shobhit Mukut Himalaya" during morning assembly and "Prabhat-Pheri" on 15 August and 26 January every year. Fifteen or more artists recite the same song in Mumbai on 9 August every year, at [[Gowalia Tank|August Kranti Maidan]] in front of the Chief Minister of [[Maharashtra]] State and thousands of other patriots.

'''Kahaniya'''

Khare also wrote numerous stories during his lifetime covering many aspects of life, poverty, love, and romance some with a patriotic flavor. One of his story collections is ''Sapano ki Nagaree'' written between 1940 and 1943 which was re-published in 2012 by Vani Prakashan, New Delhi. The same publisher also reissued ''Dur Path ke Rahee'', originally written in 1941, and plans to release the story collection ''Aaratee ke Deep''.

'''Upanyaas'''

Khare also contributed several Upanyaas to the world of Hindi literature such as ''Kashmeer'' written in 1948. Others worthy of mention include: ''Jeevan path ke raahi'', ''Mere Jeevan Prishth na padhe'', and ''Lekh Holi'', Nadi, '''Natak'''-Our Cinema and krasnavtar. Khare also wrote a famous essay on Shri Padumlal Punnalal Baxi in 1951 titled "padumlal Punna laal baxi meri drushti main" the same lekh was published in 1972 by Shri Narmada Prasad Khare."Sahitya Jagat Ke Biniva Padumlal Punnalal Baxi" in his name . This was brought to notice of knowledgeable Hindi experts.

==Music CDs==
In early 1950s, Khare's work was used to compose songs sung by the artist, Smt. Santosh Jhanjhi. Nearly five decades after it was written, Khare's poems were the basis of songs on CDs such as: माँ! तुम हो भारत की माता, भोर के गीत and विजन के फूल. Lately, a few of his songs were also sung by Shri Shekhar Shrivastava from [[Dhanbad]] with Kumari Aashita Awasthy from [[Kanpur]].

==Tributes and events==
Each year thousands of Hindi readers, students, and Ph.D and MA candidates across India come together to acknowledge, and to spread the word about Khare's contributions to the world of Hindi literature. Below is the list of events and programs held in remembrance of some of his classic works.

'''Kayapó''', also known as '''Mẽbengokre''', is a [[Jê languages|Jê language]] of [[Brazil]]. It is an indigenous language used in the eastern part of the Amazon, north of Mato Grosso and Para in Brazil.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~asalanov/mebengokre.html|title=Mebengokre|last=Salanova|first=Andres|access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mebengokre belongs to the Jê family and the Macro-Jê family stock. There are around 8,638 native speakers since 2010 based on the 2015 Ethnologue 18th edition. Due to the number of speakers the influence of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] speakers, the language stands at a sixth level of endangerment; in which the materials for literacy and education in Kayapô are very limited.

== Ethnography ==
The names Kayapô and Mebengokre do not only make reference to the language itself but have also been used to classify the indigenous communities that speak this language. Kayapô means “those who look like monkeys”&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Terence. “Os Mebengokre Kayapô: Historia E Mudança Social, De comunidades autónomas para a coexistência interétnica.” 1992. Translated by Beatriz Moises.

&lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://etnolinguistica.wdfiles.com/local--files/hist%3Ap311-338/p311-338_Turner_Os_Mebengokre_Kayapô.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt; Accessed 30 September 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used to distinguish the [[Kayapo people|Kayapô]] group from the other Mebengokre speaking peoples. The name Mebengokre has a meaning of itself; when referring to people, it means “the men of the hole/place of water.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Verswijver, Gustaff. "Kayapó." ''Enciclopédia dos Povos Indígenas no Brasil''. 2002.
&lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/Kayapô/print&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt; Accessed 30 September 2016. 
&lt;/ref&gt; "Although there are differences between the dialects spoken among the various ethnic groups, all recognize themselves as participants in a common culture."&lt;ref&gt;“Kayapô/Mebengokre” Encuentro Do Culturas. 2012.

&lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.encontrodeculturas.com.br/2012/artista/Kayapô-mebengokre&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt; Accessed 30 September 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The first historical records of the Kayapô language and culture date back to the end of the 19th century written by the French explorer [[Henri Coudreau]], who came in contact with the Irã'ã Mrãjre Kayapô. The following writings were made by the missionaries who arrived to Brazil later in the century to Christianize the indigenous people. Known authors of such period are Father Sebastião and Reverend Horace Banner, who lived among another Mebengokre group known as Gorotire Kayapó between 1937 and 1951.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Although, “the Mebengokre [have been in] permanent contact with the surrounding non-indigenous population at various times, in most cases [there have been] catastrophic consequences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Irã'ã Mrãjre are now extinct, and the population of the Gorotire Kayapó decreased by 80% during the first years of contact. Following such brutal experiences, some small refused to be approached by investigators and remain uncontacted around the Xingu and Curua rivers.

Since the exploration period, academic linguists and anthropologists have investigated the Mebengokre and have successfully acquired a body of knowledge about this indigenous group. There are academic writings on the descriptive grammar and phonology of Kayapô language; some by Stout and Thomson in 1974, and Borgues in 1995, dictionaries with Portuguese translations; syntactic and phonological studies by Andres Salanova and Amelia Silva, translations of the [[New Testament]] into Kayapô published in 1996, and literary works including myth and ritual stories and descriptions of the Mebengokre speaking communities.

Furthermore, the Brazilian organization ProDocult began a documentation project of the Kayapô language and culture in April 2009 and thus far have produced "150 hours of video recording, 15 hours of audio recording and more than 6,000 digital photos, in addition to ... films [containing] records of "culture" Mebengokre, and how could it be ... highly dynamic [in its] creative aspect."&lt;ref&gt;Kayapô." ProDocult. 2015.&lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://prodocult.museudoindio.gov.br/etnias/Kayapô/projeto&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt; Accessed 30 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;nowiki/&gt;Phonetics ==
Mebengokre/Kayapô is composed of 16 consonants and 17 vowels;&lt;ref&gt;Salanova, A. P. (2001). ''A nasalidade em Mebengokre e Apinayé: o limite do vozeamento soante.'' Master's thesis, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas.&lt;/ref&gt; vowel production occurs both orally and nasally. Voiced oral stops are a unique feature of Mebengokre among the Jȇ family{{vague|date=March 2018}}.

== Morphology ==
The morphological aspect of the Kayapô is still under research given the complexity that nasality adds to the construction of morpho-syntactic. According to Linguistics Ph.D Professor Patience Epps “the manifestation of nasality in Amazonian languages has practical implications for the development of orthographies.”&lt;ref&gt;Epps, Patience and Salanova, Andres. 2012. Languages of Amazonia. 2012.&lt;http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~asalanov/Docs/amazonian.pdf&gt; Accessed 6 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As well, languages from the Amazon are “weakly-tensed languages; where tense may be left unexpressed” (18). In the case of Kayapô, verbs inflect through reduplication and although there is no morphological distinction between present and past, the completion or continuation of an action is determined by the narrative context.

Reduplication indicates repeated actions and transitivity of verbs as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Salanova, Andres. “Reduplication and Verbal number in Mebengokre&gt; 27 Feb 2011. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~asalanov/Docs/reduplication.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt; Accessed 6 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In some verbs, such as ''prõrprõt'' (to float up and down or), there is variation in order to follow the /r/ to /t/ to the syllabic structures C(C)V and C(C)VC.

=== Pronouns ===
Mebengokre has a set of pronouns to which affixes can be added during the formation of sentence types.

Basic form of pronouns:

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Third person can occur in different ways; by not adding inflection to words that are normally inflected and by affixing ''ku-'' to a small class of transitive verbs and prepositions to form an accusative sentence.

== Syntax ==

=== Case System ===
In Mebengokre any content word can be a direct object. Mebengokre has a split case system composed of the nominative, ergative, absolute and accusative (direct object) cases; each with different affixes.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, M.A and Salanova, Andres. “Verbo y ergatividad escindida en Mêbêngôkre” 2000.  &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~asalanov/Docs/verbo.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt; Accessed 6 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nominative and Ergative Case ====
These cases are mandatory to express the subject of the sentence. For instance:

(1)

a)  arɤm nẽ           ba ar i.tẽm mʌ̃

now Non-FUT 1Nom PC 1.go to

''‘We are leaving’''

b)  dʒʌ̃m nẽ              ga aje       ɔmũɲ    ket

INT Non-FUT 2Nom 2Erg 3+see Neg

''‘Don’t you see?’''

In 1a. the nominative case introduces the subject of the main clause while 2b. introduces the subject in a subordinate clause with a non-finite verb.

==== Absolute case ====
The absolute case is not unique to subject and object arguments of non-finite verbs. It is also used when representing the object argument of finite verbs. For instance:

(2)

uɤrɤ           mã   nẽ            tẽ

3+shower to Non-FUT Go

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'He/She is taking a shower / going to take a shower'''

==== Accusative case ====
It is the same as the absolute case, except it present in transitive verbs.

(3)

arɤm nẽ              ba ku.ma

Already Non-FUT 1Nom 3Acc.Listen/hear

''‘I heard it [already]’''

== Semantics ==

=== Tense ===
Mebengokre tenses are expressed in terms of finiteness rather than aspectual morphology. The following sentence shows the role of verbal finiteness when determining tense:

'''(4)'''

a.

krwɣj jã        nẽ           mop krẽ

parakeet DEM NFUT Malanga eat.V

''‘This parakeet ate (the) Malanga’''

b.

krwɣj jã         nẽ        kutɛ   mop krẽn

parakeet DEM NFUT 3RG Malanga eat.N

''‘This parakeet has eaten Malanga (at least once in his life)’''

The semantic interpretation of 4''a'' positions the events with respect to the time which can only be determined by narrative context.In contrast, 4b makes the event not "anaphoric to discourse, but rather coterminous with the subject’s lifespan (mutatis mutandis for inanimate subjects). This interpretation has been variously described as “stative” or “subject-oriented” (in the sense that it ascribes a property to the subject, rather than focusing on the event itself) in the descriptive literature.”&lt;ref&gt;Salanova, Andres. “Building Blocks of Aspectual Interpretation. 2007. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~asalanov/Docs/meb-aspect.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt; Accessed 6 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''keyline''', in [[graphic design]], is a boundary line that separates color and [[monochromatic]] areas or differently colored areas of printing on a given page or other printed piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://labelprintingportland.com/keyline/|title=What is a keyline and why we use them - Rose City Label|date=2013-08-16|work=Rose City Label|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line itself, usually consisting of a black (or other dark colored) border, provides an area in which lighter colors can be printed with slight variation in registration. In traditional [[paste-up]] graphics workflows, keylines for cropping were often merely indicated on original artwork, and then images were stripped into the area manually with the keylines themselves being added as part of the process. Keylines are often included when printing something that will be cut out using a die form, requires folding, or uses perforation lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indesignsecrets.com/creating-keylines.php|title=Creating Keylines - InDesignSecrets.com|date=2015-12-07|work=InDesignSecrets|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per the [[International Paper]]'s Pocket Pal (18th ed., printed in 2000), keyline is defined as being "in artwork, an outline drawing of finished art to indicate the exact shape, position, and size for elements such as [[halftones]], line sketches, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruno |first=Michael H. |date=October 2000 |title=

In [[psycholinguistics]], '''language production''' is the production of spoken or written language.  It describes all of the stages between having a concept, and translating that concept into linguistic form. In [[computational linguistics]]/[[natural language processing]] and [[artificial intelligence]], the term [[natural language generation]] (NLG) is more common, and those models may or may not be psychologically motivated.

== Stages of production ==
Language production consists of several interdependent processes which transform a nonlinguistic message into a spoken, signed, or written linguistic signal. Though the following steps proceed in this approximate order, there is plenty of interaction and communication between them. The process of message planning is an active area of psycholinguistic research, but researchers have found that it is an ongoing process throughout language production. Research suggests that messages are planned in roughly the same order that they are  in an [[utterance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown-Schmidt|first=Sarah|last2=Tanenhaus|first2=Michael|date=2006|title=Watching the eyes when talking about size: an investigation of message formulation and utterance planning|url=|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=54|pages=592–609|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2005.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After identifying a message, or part of a message, to be linguistically encoded, a speaker must select the individual words—also known as [[lexical item]]s—to represent that message. This process is called lexical selection. The words are selected based on their meaning, which in linguistics is called [[Semantics|semantic]] information. Lexical selection activates the word's [[Lemma (psycholinguistics)|lemma]], which contains both semantic and grammatical information about the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dell|first=Gary|last2=O'Seaghdha|first2=Padraig|date=1992|title=Stages of lexical access in language production|url=|journal=Cognition|volume=42|pages=287–314|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(92)90046-k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This grammatical information is then used in the next step of language production, grammatical encoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levelt|first=Willem|date=|title=A theory of lexical access in speech production|url=|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=22|pages=3–6| PMID = 11301520 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x99001776}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical grammatical information includes characteristics such as the word's [[syntactic category]] (noun, verb, etc.), what objects it takes, and [[grammatical gender]] if it is present in the language. Using some of these characteristics as well as information about the [[Thematic relation|thematic roles]] of each word in the intended message, each word is then assigned the grammatical and thematic role it will have in the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psycholinguistics: Critical Concepts in Psychology|last=Bock|first=Kathryn|last2=Levelt|first2=Willem|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=0-415-26701-3|editor-last=Atlmann|editor-first=Gerry|volume=5|location=New York|pages=405–407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Function morphemes, like the plural /s/ or the past tense /ɪd/, are added in this stage as well. After an utterance, or part of one, has been formed, it then goes through phonological encoding. In this stage of language production, the mental representation of the words to be spoken is transformed into a sequence of [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]] to be pronounced. The speech sounds are assembled in the order they are to be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schiller|first=Niels|last2=Bles|first2=Mart|last3=Jansma|first3=Bernadette|date=2003|title=Tracking the time course of phonological encoding in speech production: an event-related brain potential study|url=|journal=Cognitive Brain Research|volume=17|pages=819–831|doi=10.1016/s0926-6410(03)00204-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic loop occurring in the creation of language consists of the following stages:
* Intended message
* Encode message into linguistic form
* Encode linguistic form into speech [[motor system]]
* Sound goes from speaker's mouth to hearer's ear [[auditory system]]
* Speech is decoded into linguistic form
* Linguistic form is decoded into meaning
According to the lexical access model (see section below), in terms of lexical access, two different stages of cognition are employed; thus, this concept is known as the two-stage theory of lexical access. The first stage, lexical selection provides information about lexical items required to construct the functional level representation. These items are retrieved according to their specific semantic and syntactic properties, but phonological forms are not yet made available at this stage. The second stage, retrieval of wordforms, provides information required for building the positional level representation.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48014482|title=Psycholinguistics : critical concepts in psychology|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|others=Altmann, Gerry T. M.|isbn=0415229901|location=London|oclc=48014482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models of production ==

=== Serial model ===
A serial model of language production divides the process into several stages. For example, there may be one stage for determining pronunciation and a stage for determining lexical content. The serial model does not allow overlap of these stages, so they may only be completed one at a time.

=== Connectionist model ===
Several researchers have proposed a connectionist model, one notable example being Dell {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. According to his connectionist model, there are four layers of processing and understanding: semantic, syntactic, morphological, and phonological.  These work in parallel and in series, with activation at each level. Interference and misactivation can occur at any of these stages. Production begins with concepts, and continues down from there. One might start with the concept of a cat: a four-legged, furry, domesticated mammal with whiskers, etc.  This conceptual set would attempt to find the corresponding word {cat}.  This selected word would then select morphological and phonological data /k / at/.  The distinction of this model is that, during this process, other elements would also be primed ({rat} might be somewhat primed, for example), as they are physically similar, and so can cause conceptual interference. Errors might also occur at the phoneme level, as many words are phonetically similar, e.g. mat. Substitutions of similar consonant sounds are more likely to occur, e.g. between plosive stop consonants such as d, p and b. Lower primed words are less likely to be chosen, but interference is thought to occur in cases of early selection, where the level of activation of the target and interference words is at the same level. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

=== Lexical access model ===
This model states that the sentence is made by a sequence of processes generating differing levels of representations. For instance, the functional level representation is made on the a preverbal representation, which is essentially what the speaker seeks to express. This level is responsible for encoding the meanings of lexical items and the way that grammar forms relationships between them. Next, the positional level representation is built, which functions to encode the phonological forms of words and the order they are found in sentence structures. Lexical access, according to this model, is a process that encompasses two serially ordered and independent stages.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

== Additional aspects of production ==

=== Fluency ===
{{main|Fluency}}Fluency can be defined in part by prosody, which is shown graphically by a smooth intonation contour, and by a number of other elements: control of speech rate, relative timing of stressed and unstressed syllables, changes in amplitude, and changes in fundamental frequency.

=== Multilingualism ===
Whether or not a speaker is fluent in only one language, the process for producing language remains the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics|last=Fernández|first=Eva M.|last2=Cairns|first2=Helen Smith|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=9781405191470|location=|pages=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, bilinguals speaking two languages within a conversation access both languages at the same time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grosjean | first1 = F | year = 1999 | title = The bilingual's language modes | url = | journal = One mind, two languages: Bilingual language processing | volume = 7 | issue = 11| pages = 1–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three most commonly discussed models for multilingual language access are the [[Bilingual interactive activation plus|Bilingual Interactive Activation model]], the Revised Hierarchical Model, and the Language Mode model:
* '''Bilingual Interactive Activation Plus''', updated from a model made by Dijkstra and Van Heuven, uses solely [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up processing]] to facilitate bilingual language access.
* '''Revised Hierarchical Model''', developed by Kroll and Stewart, is a model suggesting that bilingual brains store meanings in a common place, word-forms are separated by language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kroll|first=Judith F.|last2=Stewark|first2=Erika|date=1994|title=Category interference in translation and picture naming: Evidence for asymmetric connections between bilingual memory representations|url=|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=33|pages=149–174|doi=10.1006/jmla.1994.1008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Language Mode Model''', made by Grosjean, uses two assumptions to map bilingual language production in a modular way. These assumptions are that a base language is activated in conversation, and that the speaker's other language is activated to relative degrees depending on context.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; De Bot describes it as overly simple for the complexity of the process, but suggests it has room for expansion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Speakers fluent in multiple languages can inhibit access to one of their languages, but this suppression can only be done once the speaker is at a certain level of proficiency in that language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Bot | first1 = K | year = 2004 | title = The multilingual lexicon: Modeling selection and control | url = | journal = The International Journal of Multilingualism | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 17–32 | doi=10.1080/14790710408668176}}&lt;/ref&gt; A speaker can decide to inhibit a language based on non-linguistic cues in their conversation, such as a speaker of both English and French conversing with people who only speak English. When especially proficient multilingual speakers communicate, they can participate in [[code-switching]]. Code-switching has been shown to indicate bilingual proficiency in a speaker, though it had previously been seen as a sign of poor language ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poplack|first=Shana|date=1980|title=Sometimes I'll start a sentence in Spanish y termino en español|url=|journal=Linguistics|volume=18|pages=581–618|doi=10.1515/ling.1980.18.7-8.581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research into production ==
There are two main types of research into [[speech production]]. One type focuses on using the analysis of speech errors. The other looks at reaction-time data from picture-naming latencies. Although originally disparate, these two methodologies are generally looking at the same underlying processes of speech production.&lt;ref name="Levelt 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Levelt | first1 = Willem J. M. | last2 = Roelofs | first2 = A. | last3 = Meyer | first3 = AS. | title = A theory of lexical access in speech production. | journal = Behav Brain Sci | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 1-38; discussion 38-75 |date=Feb 1999 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.104.7511 | PMID = 11301520 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x99001776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Speech errors ===
{{main|Speech error}}
Analysis of speech errors has found that not all are random, but rather systematic and fall into several categories. Although speech production is very fast, (2 words per second) the error rate of the utterances are relatively rare (less than 1/1000)&lt;ref name="Levelt 1989"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Levelt | first1 = Willem J. M. | title = Speaking : from intention to articulation | date = 1989 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Mass. | isbn = 978-0-262-12137-8 | oclc = 797827712 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and those errors are categorized as follows:

*'''Anticipation''': The word is in the speaker's mind and ready to be spoken, but the speaker says it too quickly. This could be because the speaker is planning and holding words in their mind.
*'''Perseveration''': The word retains characteristics of a word said previously in a sentence:
::''Taddle Tennis instead of Paddle Tennis''

*'''Blending''': More than one word is being considered and the two intended items "blend" into a single item, perhaps implying the speaker is waffling between a few word options.
::''The child is looking to be spaddled instead of spanked or paddled''

*'''Addition''': adding of linguistics material, resulting in words like ''implossible''. 
*'''Substitution''': a whole word of related meaning is replacing another. These errors can be far apart from another, or target words, and are generally grammatically consistent and accurate.
::at low speed it's too light (instead of heavy)

*'''Malapropism''': a lay term referring to the incorrect substitution of words. It is a reference to a character Mrs Malaprop from [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]]'s [[The Rivals]].
::''Makes no delusions to the past.''
::''The pineapple of perfection.''
::''I have interceded another letter from the fellow.''

*'''Spoonerism''': switching the letters from words. For example, the phrase ''slips of the tongue'' could become ''tips of the slung''.

It is also known, in English, as Slovenian. Two minority languages, namely [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], are recognised as co-official languages and accordingly protected in their residential municipalities.&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dz-rs.si/index.php?id=351&amp;docid=25&amp;showdoc=1 |title=Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia |publisher=National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=26 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223221038/http://www.dz-rs.si/index.php?id=351&amp;docid=25&amp;showdoc=1 |archivedate=23 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other significant languages are [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and its variants and [[Serbian language|Serbian]], spoken by most immigrants from [[former Yugoslavia]] and their descendants. Slovenia is ranked among the top European countries regarding the knowledge of foreign languages. The most often taught foreign languages are [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], followed by Italian, [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name="MLD 2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stat.si/eng/novica_prikazi.aspx?id=2957 |title=International Mother Language Day 2010 |publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Slovenia has become more diverse in regard to its language through recent decades but is still relatively homogenous — [[Slovene language|Slovene]] was in 2002 the first language of 87.8% of the inhabitants.&lt;ref name="MLD 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strubelj"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://geo.ff.uni-lj.si/pisnadela/pdfs/dipl_200610_dejan_strubelj.pdf |title=Primerjava narodne, verske in jezikovne sestave Slovenije: diplomsko delo |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Comparison of Ethnic, Religious and Ethnic Structure of Slovenia: Diploma Thesis |first=Dejan |last=Štrubelj |publisher=Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana |year=2006 |accessdate=29 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511064247/http://geo.ff.uni-lj.si/pisnadela/pdfs/dipl_200610_dejan_strubelj.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by [[Croatian language|Croatian]] (2.8%), [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (1.6%) and so-called [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] (1.6%).

==Slovene==
[[Image:Slovenian language map.png|thumb|Areas where Slovene is spoken|300px]]
In its Article 11, the [[Constitution of Slovenia]] stipulates that Slovene is to be the sole official and national language throughout the country. The Public Use of the Slovene Language Act of 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uradni-list.si/1/objava.jsp?urlid=200486&amp;stevilka=3841| title=Ukaz o razglasitvi Zakona o javni rabi slovenščine (ZJRS) |language=Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt; further defines the legal status of Slovene, by mandating that national and local authorities are compelled to use it in communication and legislation. As a national language, it is used on the obverse side of [[Slovenian euro coins]], in [[Zdravljica|Slovenian national anthem]], by [[List of Presidents of Slovenia|The Slovenian President]], and uniquely represents [[Slovenes|Slovene culture]] on the international stage.

Television and radio broadcasts, newspapers, commercials, user manuals, and other printed or broadcast material must be in Slovene. Usage of material in another language is permitted, if it is accordingly subtitled, dubbed or translated. Publishing or broadcasting untranslated material, as well as selling goods without instructions and declaration in Slovene, is punishable and banned by law. Also, names of corporations and trademarks registered in Slovenia must be in Slovene; however, they may be used along with the translated name in another language if its aimed at foreign markets.

Slovene is the language of instruction at all levels of schooling, from primary to tertiary education. There is an international high school in [[Ljubljana]] with English as the language of instruction, but it admits only students from foreign diplomats and Slovenes who had been schooled abroad for several years. Undergraduate courses are run in Slovene, therefore applicants from foreign countries must prove an adequate level of knowledge of Slovene to be eligible to enroll. Graduate courses for foreign exchange students are offered in English, as well.

The Centre for Slovene as a Second/Foreign Language&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerslo.net/index.asp?LANG=eng Centre for Slovene as a Second/Foreign Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217232608/http://www.centerslo.net/index.asp?LANG=eng |date=2007-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; encourages the learning of Slovene as foreign language, offers different courses in Slovene, and grants certificates of language proficiency. One may sit for the Slovene Language Exam at three levels: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. After having passed the exam, the applicant receives the certificate of knowledge of the Slovene language, issued by the Faculty of Arts of [[University of Ljubljana]], which is valid throughout the European Union, and makes the holder eligible to apply to any school or university in Slovenia.

With the accession of Slovenia to the European Union on May 1, 2004, Slovene became an official language of the [[European Union]], requiring that all Acts and Directives be translated into Slovene. Additionally, Slovenian citizens may write to any EU institution in Slovene and expect a response in the same language.

===Dialects===
{{main|Slovene dialects}}
Slovene is divided into seven regional dialectal groups, further subdivided into local dialects. Mutual comprehension between certain dialects is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Sussex, Roland &amp; Paul V. Cubberley. 2006. ''The Slavic Languages''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Slavic languages and Albanian===
A significant number of Slovenian population speak a variant of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] as their native language. These are mostly immigrants who moved to Slovenia from other [[former Yugoslav]] republics from the 1960s to the late 1980s, and their descendants. 0.4% of the Slovenian population declared themselves as native speakers of [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and 0.2% as native speakers of [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="stat.si"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.stat.si/popis2002/gradivo/2-169.pdf |title=Verska, jezikovna in narodna sestava prebivalstva Slovenije: Popisi 1921-2002 |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Religious, Linguistic, and National Composition of the Slovenian Population: 1921-2002 Censuses |format=PDF |publisher=Statistični urad Republike Slovenije |year=2003 |issue=2 |first=Milivoja |last=Šircelj |isbn=961-239-024-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small Croatian speaking community in [[White Carniola]], whose existence predates Yugoslavia. In four villages ([[Miliči]], [[Bojanci]], [[Marindol]] and [[Paunoviči]]), people speak the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]], with a strong influence of Slovene. People living there are mainly [[Serbian Orthodox]] and descendants of Serbian [[Uskoks]], guerilla warriors against Ottoman invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{sl icon}} http://www.inv.si/DocDir/projekti/percepcija_slo_int_pol_Bela_krajina_koncni_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romani==
[[Romani language|Romani]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www2.arnes.si/~ljinv16/RIG/RIG%2052/rig%2052%20celota%20E%20TISK.pdf |title=Legal Protection of Roma in Slovenia |first=Vera |last=Klopčič |journal=Treatises and Documents: Journal of Ethnic Studies |year=2007 |issue=52 |pages=234–255 |publisher=Institute for Ethnic Studies |issn=1854-5181}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoken in 2002 as the native language by 0.2% of people, is a legally protected language in Slovenia. These people mainly belong to the geographically dispersed and marginalized Roma community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.inv.si/DocDir/Publikacije-PDF/2003/evropa,%20slovenija%20in%20romi_optimized.pdf |title=Evropa, Slovenija in Romi |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Europe, Slovenia and Roma |first=Vera |last=Klopčič |author2=Miroslav Polzer  |year=2003 |isbn=961-6159-23-2 |publisher=Institute for Ethnic Studies |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German==
[[German language|German]] and [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] dialects have been autochthonous since present-day Slovenia came under the rule of [[Bavaria]] in the 8th century. Whereas many immigrants from German-speaking areas adopted Slovene over the centuries, others retained their language. Until the 20th century, the most numerous German-speaking communities were found in the urban centers of [[Lower Styria]], in the [[Gottschee|Gottschee County]] in southern Slovenia and in the villages around [[Apače]] ([[Apaško polje]]) along the [[Mur (river)|Mura]] river.

According to the last Austrian census of 1910, around 9% of the population of present-day Slovenia spoke German as their native tongue. Towns with a German-speaking majority included [[Maribor]], [[Celje]], [[Ptuj]], [[Kočevje]], [[Slovenj Gradec]], [[Slovenska Bistrica]], [[Ormož]], [[Dravograd]] and some other smaller towns.

After World War I, the number of German-speakers dropped significantly: most of the towns were slovenized, and German remained the majority language only in the Gottschee County and around Apače. According to the last pre-WWII Yugoslav census, German speakers amounted to 2.5% of the overall population. Former German or bilingual speakers had switched to Slovene, the official language.

During [[World War II]], ethnic Germans were resettled from areas occupied by Italy ([[Ljubljana]], [[Gottschee]]) into the German-occupied zone. After the war, the great majority of the remaining Germans had to leave the country. In the census of 2002, just 1628 persons (0,1% of the population) declared German as their mother tongue. Almost everyone today born in Slovenia knows Slovene because people learn obligatory Slovene in school, but many at home speak other languages as well. The number of people fluent in German is unknown. German-speaking women around Maribor who are citizens of Slovenia have organized in the association ''Kulturno društvo nemško govorečih žena »Mostovi« Maribor'' ("Bridges").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drustvo-mostovi.si/de/content/veronika-haring-obfrau Veronika Haring], president of ''[http://www.drustvo-mostovi.si/ Kulturno društvo nemško govorečih žena »Mostovi« Maribor]'' in 2011, accessed 15 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gottscheerish===
[[Gottscheerish]] or Granish is a [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] dialect of the [[German language]] and has been spoken in the [[Gottschee|Gottschee County]] around [[Kočevje]] (Gottschee) since 1330. For over 600 years, it was the predominant oral language of the [[Gottscheers]] in that area, whereas [[Standard German]] was their written language. Most Gottschee Germans were resettled by the German occupation forces in 1941 during [[World War II]]. Only a few hundred Gottscheers remained, most of them supporting the partisan movement. After the war, Gottscheerish was forbidden. Today there are only a few speakers left, most of them in Moschnitze valley (Črmošnjiško-Poljanska dolina) between [[Kočevske Poljane]] and [[Črmošnjice, Semič|Črmošnjice]], others today mainly know standard German.&lt;ref name=pmk20&gt;[http://www.pmk-kocevje.si/media/pdf/nemski_jezikovni_otok/pdf/20.pdf Pokrajinski muzej Kočevje: Vsi niso odšli / Not all of them left] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402185328/http://www.pmk-kocevje.si/media/pdf/nemski_jezikovni_otok/pdf/20.pdf |date=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unesco-gottscheer"&gt;Christopher Moseley (ed.).

===Recognition===
Gottscheerish and German, though autochthonous to Slovenia, have no official status and are not protected by law.&lt;ref&gt;European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. [http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/Report/EvaluationReports/SloveniaECRML3_en.pdf Application of the Charter in Slovenia]. Strasbourg, 26 May 2010. ECRML (2010) 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Czech and Slovak==
[[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]], which used to be the fourth largest minority language in Slovenia prior to World War II (after Italian, German, Hungarian, Croatian and Serbian), is now the native languages of a few hundred Slovenian residents.&lt;ref name="stat.si"/&gt;

== Foreign languages ==
[[File:Foreign languages Slovenia.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The most commonly known foreign languages in Slovenia in 2005. According to [[Eurostat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf |title=Special Eurobarometer 243: Europeans and their Languages |publisher=European Commission |date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Historically, German was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of [[Central Europe]]an space and was perceived as the language of commerce, science and literature in Slovenia. Consequently, German used to be the first foreign language taught in schools. With the formation of Yugoslavia, so-called [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] became the language of federal authorities and the first foreign language taught in school. But also, Slovenes pick up Croatian more easily than other foreign languages due to its relative similarity to Slovene.

Nowadays, English has superseded it and is taught as the first foreign language throughout the country from pre-school onwards. German has, however, retained its strong position as an important language and is the most common second foreign language in high schools. According to the EU, Slovenia has the highest competence in German of any non-Germanic country, with only Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Denmark being higher.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:German foreign language EU.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other second foreign languages are Italian, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and Hungarian. Among the five subjects in the Slovenian finishing exam ([[Matura]]), one foreign language—most commonly English—is compulsory.

As a consequence of different foreign languages having been taught at different times, there is no prevailing foreign language knowledge in Slovenia. Younger generations know English and Croatian well enough to communicate, whereas elder generations speak Croatian better. There are also regional differences, especially among the knowledge of a second foreign language, with German being more frequently taught and used in [[Lower Styria|Styria]] region, whereas residents of the [[Slovenian Littoral|Littoral]] region have better familiarity with Italian.

When the circumstances of [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]], the primary victim in one of the most severe cases of [[child abuse|abuse]], [[child neglect|neglect]] and [[social isolation]] on record in medical literature, first became known in early November 1970, authorities arranged for her admission to [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]], where doctors determined that at the age of 13 years and 7 months she had not acquired a [[first language]].{{sfn|Reynolds|Fletcher-Janzen|2004|pp=428–429}}&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=}} Hospital staff then began teaching Genie to speak [[General American]] [[English language|English]], and she gradually began to learn and use language. Their efforts soon caught the attention of [[linguist]]s, who saw her as an important way to gain further insight into [[Language development|acquisition of language skills]] and linguistic development. Starting in late May 1971, [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] professor [[Victoria Fromkin]] headed a team of linguists who began a detailed case study on Genie's progress with learning language. One of Fromkin's graduate students, Susan Curtiss, became especially involved in testing and recording Genie's linguistic development. Linguists' observations of Genie began that month, and in October of that year they began actively testing what principles of language she had acquired and was acquiring. Their studies enabled them to publish several academic works examining theories and hypotheses regarding the proposed [[Critical period hypothesis|critical period]] during which humans learn to understand and use language.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=}}&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;

On broader levels Genie followed some normal patterns of young children acquiring a first language, but researchers noted many marked differences with her linguistic development. The size of her [[vocabulary]] and the speed with which she expanded it consistently outstripped anticipations, and many of the earliest words she learned and used were very different from typical first-language learners and strongly indicated that she possessed highly developed cognitive abilities. By contrast, she had far more difficulty acquiring and utilizing [[grammar]]. She clearly mastered some basic aspects of grammar, and understood significantly more than she used in her own speech, but her rate of grammar acquisition was much slower than normal. As a result,  her vocabulary was consistently much more advanced and sophisticated than most people in equivalent phases of grammar acquisition. Researchers attributed some of her abnormal expressive language to physical difficulties she faced with speech production, and worked very hard to improve her ability to speak. Within months of being discovered Genie developed exceptional nonverbal communication skills and became capable of utilizing several methods of nonverbal communication to compensate for her lack of language, so researchers decided to also teach her a form of [[sign language]].{{sfn|Reynolds|Fletcher-Janzen|2004|pp=428–429}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;

By the time the scientists finished working with Genie, she had not fully mastered English grammar and her rate of acquisition had significantly slowed down. Linguists ultimately concluded that because Genie had not learned a first language before the critical period had ended, she was unable to fully acquire a language. Furthermore, despite the clear improvements in her conversational competence it remained very low, and her vocalizations remained highly atypical. While she had expanded her use of language to serve a wider range of functions, she had an unusually difficult time utilizing it during social interactions. Tests on Genie's brain found she was acquiring language in the right hemisphere of her brain despite being right-handed, giving rise to many new hypotheses and refining existing hypotheses on [[cerebral lateralization]] and its effect on linguistic development.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=}}&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981&gt;{{cite journal | title=Dissociations between language and cognition: cases and implications | url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/curtiss/1981%20-%20Dissociations%20between%20language%20and%20cognition.pdf | author=Curtiss, Susan | journal=[[Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders]] | year=1981 | volume=11 | issue=1 | doi=10.1007/BF01531338 | issn=0162-3257 | oclc=114861365 | pmid=6927695 | pages=15–30 | accessdate=April 30, 2013| citeseerx=10.1.1.255.6376 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing of Genie's language occurred until the end of 1977, but in mid-1975, when she was 18 years old, authorities placed her in a foster care setting which subjected her to extreme physical and emotional abuse, causing her to become afraid to speak and to rapidly begin losing her newly acquired language skills.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=148–155}}&lt;ref name=FeralChildren&gt;{{cite episode | title=Wild Child | series=[[Body Shock]] | credits=Weston, Jonah (director/producer) | network=[[Channel 4]] | location=London, UK | airdate=July 2002| season=1 | number=2 | oclc=437863794}}&lt;/ref&gt; After removal from this location in April 1977 she moved through several more placements, some of which were highly abusive, causing further regression of her language skills.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=155–159, 200–202, 219}} In early January 1978 Genie's mother suddenly decided to prevent any further testing and scientific observations of Genie, and the very little available information on her ability to communicate since that time is exclusively from personal observations or secondary accounts of them. Nonetheless, linguists have continued analyzing Genie's language long after this time. Since the case study on Genie ended, there has been some controversy and debate among linguists about how much grammar she had acquired and for how long she had been learning new aspects of language.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rigler1993&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4D6103FF930A25755C0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spo | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107224531/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/13/books/l-letters-669393.html | archivedate=November 7, 2012 | deadurl=no | title=Rigler, Letter to the Editor | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 13, 1993 | accessdate=December 21, 2009 | last=Rigler | first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=184–185, 209–212}}

==Background==
Genie was the last, and second surviving, of four children of parents living in [[Arcadia, California]], and was born in 1957 without any noted complications at a normal, healthy weight and size. Around the time of her birth, her father began to isolate himself and his family from other people.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=4–5}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=11–16}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=205}} Her father decided that she was severely [[intellectual disability|mentally retarded]] because she was late to walk due to treatment for a congenital hip dislocation, a view which intensified as she got older, and consequently disliked her. He tried not to talk to or pay attention to her and discouraged his wife and son, who was five years older than Genie, from doing so.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=4–5}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=11–16}}

Doctors and scientists who worked with Genie were uncertain about most of her life from birth to 20 months. By the age of 11 months she was falling behind in her physical development, which researchers believed was due to both [[malnutrition]] and some degree of [[neglect]], although the few medical records from the first year of her life noted no physical or mental abnormalities.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=4–5}} In conversations with members of the research team that studied Genie, her mother said that as a baby Genie was not very cuddly and did not [[babbling|babble]] very much. At times she claimed that at an undetermined point Genie said some unspecified individual words, but on other occasions said that Genie never produced speech of any kind, preventing linguists from making any definitive determinations.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=4–5, 11}} When Genie was 20 months old, after a pickup truck struck and killed her paternal grandmother, Genie's father decided to increase the family's isolation as much as possible, and because he believed Genie was severely retarded he believed she required a higher degree of isolation than the rest of the family.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=4–5}}&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974&gt;{{cite journal | title=The development of language in Genie: a case of language acquisition beyond the 'critical period' | url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/curtiss/1974%20-%20The%20development%20of%20language%20in%20Genie.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806210112/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.363.5831&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | archivedate=August 6, 2015 | deadurl=no | accessdate=June 6, 2013 | author1=Curtiss, Susan | author2=Fromkin, Victoria A. | author3=Krashen, Stephen D. | author4=Rigler, David | author5=Rigler, Marilyn | author2-link=Victoria Fromkin | author3-link=Stephen Krashen | journal=Brain and Language | volume= 1 | issue= 1 | year=1974 | doi=10.1016/0093-934X(74)90027-3 | oclc=4652742368 | issn=0093-934X | pages=81–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genie spent almost all of her childhood locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either strapped to a child's toilet or bound inside a crib with her arms and legs completely immobilized.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=4}} He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made any sound or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at her like a dog. As a result, she learned not to vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some kind of attention she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=5–6}}

Genie's father had an extremely low tolerance for any kind of noise, refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. Apart from one slightly open window Genie did not have any access to auditory stimuli outside the house, and the window was set well away from the street and other houses, so what little she heard from outside almost exclusively consisted of environmental sounds.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=5–6}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=209–212}} Her father never allowed other people in the house, only permitted his wife to be in Genie's presence for a few minutes each day while preventing her from interacting with Genie, and forced his son to assist with carrying out his abuse while otherwise preventing him from being in Genie's presence.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=5–7}} He did not permit them to speak, and especially not to or around Genie, so any conversations they had were out of Genie's earshot, keeping her from hearing any meaningful amount of language.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=5–6}}

Sometime during October 1970, Genie's mother left her husband and took Genie with her.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=5–7}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=212}} A few weeks later, on November 4, Genie's mother inadvertently entered a social services office, where a [[social worker]] observed Genie's behavior and total silence. The social worker and her supervisor brought Genie to the attention of child welfare authorities and the police, and a court order was immediately issued for Genie, who was 13 years and 7 months old, to be admitted to [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=6130233 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423023727/http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news%2Fnational_world&amp;id=6130233 |archivedate=April 23, 2013 |deadurl=no |title=Wild Child 'Genie': A Tortured Life |last=James |first=Susan Donaldson |date=May 7, 2008 |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |publisher=ABCnews.com |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nova&gt;{{cite episode | title=Secret of the Wild Child | publisher=[[PBS]] | date=October 18, 1994 | accessdate=February 12, 2009 | series=[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]] | network=PBS (United States), [[BBC]] (United Kingdom) | season=22 | number=2 | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2112gchild.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109103309/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2112gchild.html | archivedate=November 9, 2012 | deadurl=no | oclc=57894649}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police officer who arrested Genie's parents said that he and other authorities who interacted with Genie specifically noted that she did not speak.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeralChildren/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=7–10}}

==Initial assessment==
Immediately upon Genie's admission to Children's Hospital Howard Hansen, who was the head of the hospital's psychiatry division and an early expert on child abuse, and David Rigler, a therapist and [[University of California|USC]] pediatrics and psychology professor who was the chief psychologist at the hospital, took direct control of her care. The following day they assigned physician James Kent, another early advocate for child abuse awareness, to be her primary therapist.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt; Early tests placed her estimated [[mental age]] at approximately a 13-month-old level, within the range of development when the earliest phases of language acquisition begin. [[Audiometry]] tests confirmed Genie had regular hearing in both ears, doctors found no physical or mental deficiencies explaining her lack of speech, and her few existing medical records did not contain any definitive diagnoses.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13, 267–268}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=39–41}} Based on a series of daytime observations and [[sleep study|sleep studies]] that Jay Shurley, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the [[University of Oklahoma]] and a specialist in extreme social isolation, conducted in the months after her admission, doctors definitively ruled out [[autism]] or any [[brain damage]].&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=53–55}}{{sfn|Benzaquén|2006|pp=245–251}}

From the time of Genie's admission doctors saw clearly picked up some nonverbal information, with Kent emphasizing that she seemed very intent on looking at peoples' faces and made decent [[eye contact]] from other people, and she showed a small amount of responsiveness to it even in the absence of language. Despite this, Kent noted that she could only get across a few very basic needs and neither made [[facial expression]]s nor used any discernible [[body language]].&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13, 267–269}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=9–10, 40–44, 48–49}} When Genie was upset she would engage in silent, expressionless, [[self-harm]]ing tantrums until she had physically tired herself out, after which she immediately reverted to being completely non-expressive. She never cried during these outbursts—according to several firsthand accounts she could not cry at all—and if she wanted to make noise she pushed chairs or other objects. On a few occasions she responded to stimuli with a very soft, high-pitched, shrill laugh, but was otherwise completely undemonstrative.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13, 267–269}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=9–10, 40–44, 48–49}}

Kent's early notes on Genie contained little linguistic information, which linguists wrote demonstrated Genie's unresponsiveness to language. Kent observed that she seemed interested in other people talking and attentively looked at the mouth of a speaker but had almost no reaction to speech.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=10–13}} She seemed to recognize only a very few words which she always reacted to as if she heard them in isolation, and was entirely unable to respond to very basic sentences or commands without non-linguistic information. Hospital staff initially thought she understood them based on her few responses, but later determined she was reacting to accompanying nonverbal signals. She almost never tried to speak, and Kent described these efforts as, "a kind of throaty whimper."&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=10–13}} Because she had been forced to repress all vocalization during infancy and childhood her [[larynx]] and [[vocal tract]] were extremely underused and the muscles used for speech production were severely atrophied, which doctors believed made it difficult for her to control both air flow and her [[Vocal folds|vocal chords]].&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;

From tapes of Genie's first two months in the hospital, linguists discerned that by January 1971 she knew her own name, the words ''mother'' and ''father'', the four [[color]] words ''red'', ''blue'', ''green'', and ''brown'', the words ''no'' and ''sorry'', and a few miscellaneous [[noun]]s such as ''jewelry box'', ''door'', and ''bunny''. She also appeared to understand [[Negation (linguistics)|negative]] commands, and accordingly could discern a warning using a negation, although whether she understood them in the context of sentences was unclear.{{efn|For instance, in a tape from November 23rd Genie followed Kent's instructions when he handed her a rattle and told her, "Don't let the bunny get that rattle!" before trying to take it with a puppet of a rabbit. Kent told linguists that he was unsure of whether he had played that game with her before, leading them to believe Genie might have acted solely based on her understanding the negative command and the words ''bunny'' and ''rattle''.}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=93–100}}{{sfn|de Groot|2011|p=50}} There was speculation, though no conclusive evidence, that she understood the intonation to indicate a [[Yes–no question|yes or no question]] and that she understood [[imperative mood]] sentences based on tone of voice, but she otherwise lacked any grammar.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13}} Her [[active vocabulary]] at that time appeared to consist of just two short phrases, "stop it" and "no more". Some doctors thought she may have spontaneously said a few other words or negative commands, as her very few vocalizations were extremely difficult to understand, but there was no record of them and no one could remember what they might have been. Linguists could not determine the extent of her expressive or receptive vocabulary at any point before then, and therefore did not know whether she acquired any or all of this language during the preceding two months at the hospital.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13}}

Genie's comprehension and production of these few words demonstrated that she distinguished speech from other environmental sounds and could hear individual [[phoneme]]s when listening to people talking, two critical early components of language acquisition. Nonetheless, based on their observations both Children's Hospital doctors and the linguists who later worked with her concluded that she had not acquired a [[first language]] during childhood. Due to the lack of physical or mental explanations for her lack of speech, Kent and Hansen attributed it to the extreme isolation of her childhood.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13}} Kent came away from his first encounters with Genie extremely pessimistic about her [[prognosis]] on all fronts.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=10–13}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=39–41}}

==Early communication progress==
Children's Hospital staff did not keep detailed records of Genie's early linguistic progress, and she only rarely spoke during this time, so there was little data on Genie's language for the first 6 months of her stay.{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=9–10, 42–47}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13}} When Kent met with Genie for the first time, he initially observed no visible reactions from her but eventually found that she seemed afraid of a small puppet. When she threw it on the floor Kent pretended to be concerned and said, "We have to get him back", and Genie startled him when she repeated the word "back" and nervously laughed.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=40–49}} When they subsequently played with the puppet she repeated "back" several times, and when Kent said, "The puppet will fall" she repeated the word "fall". Apart from her tantrums, the times she played with this and similar puppets accounted for most of the few instances she made any outward expression during the early part of her stay.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;

Within weeks of being admitted to Children's Hospital Genie became much more responsive to nonverbal stimuli, although at first her own demeanor remained devoid of nonverbal signals. During the first months that she lived at the hospital, she gradually began to express more of her emotions outward.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–15, 267–270}} After a fairly short time, Genie's nonverbal communication skills became exceptional. Everyone who worked with her said she had an indescribable way of eliciting emotions, and she seemed able to communicate her desires without talking.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=37–38}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=51, 92–93, 117, 210–213}}

Genie's early receptive and expressive vocabulary acquisition was slow, although from the outset people observing her believed her [[linguistic performance]] was significantly behind her [[linguistic competence]]. Within a month she became far more responsive to other people talking, but doctors were unsure whether she was responding more to verbal or nonverbal stimuli.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=9–13, 16–18, 268–270}} After a month she started attempting to mimic speech, albeit very infrequently, and soon after hospital staff observed her saying "stopit", which she treated as one word, as a phrase of ritual play.{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=48–49}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=12–15, 267–269}} Even at this phase she distinguished the names of similar objects, even if they were unfamiliar, but never overgeneralized words for individual objects.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1988a|p=370}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=153}} For something unfamiliar she always sought the correct word or phrase instead of attempting to apply a word from her existing vocabulary, and could determine the names of objects based on their uses.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1988a|p=287}}

Psychologists [[Jack Block]] and Jeanne Block evaluated Genie in February 1971 and put her language below the two-year-old level on the [[Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale]]. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but could not be sure about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=14–18}} After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=16–18}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1988a|p=37}} Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=269–271}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|p=225}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=50, 89–94}}

By May 1971, most of Genie's vocabulary consisted of words for colors, the numbers 1 through 5, the word "mama" and a few peoples' names, the verbs "stop it" and "spit", and a large number of miscellaneous [[noun]]s".&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Curtiss, Susan | author2=Fromkin, Victoria A. | author3=Krashen, Stephen D. | author4=Rigler, David | author5=Rigler, Marilyn | title=The linguistic development of Genie | journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]] | year=1974 | pages=528–554 | volume=50 | issue=3 | doi=10.2307/412222 | issn=0097-8507 | oclc=4910013345 | url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/curtiss/1974%20-%20The%20linguistic%20development%20of%20Genie.pdf| accessdate=May 15, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807210505/http://ling.umd.edu/~omaki/teaching/Ling240_Winter09/Curtiss1974_genie.pdf | archivedate=August 7, 2015 | deadurl=no | jstor=412222 | citeseerx=10.1.1.257.5346 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=15}} She also knew a few [[compound verb]]s, such as ''put back'', although she treated them as single words in her vocabulary, and learned few [[stative verb]]s within the typical time frame of language acquisition. Whereas children's vocabulary primarily consists of nouns and a few [[Grammatical particle|particles]], Genie's early [[lexicon]] contained almost as many [[adjective]]s and [[verb]]s as nouns, and unlike most children she used entire phrases as labels, only doing so with single words if asked.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=189, 200–201}} Before she began forming two-word sentences she could both ask for something and associate an object with someone, which was normal, but unlike most children she could also ask about memories or future events which had previously been mentioned.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt; In late May 1971 with Jean Butler, her teacher at the hospital, Genie showed comprehension of basic commands.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=16–17}}

Genie had very little control of her voice during this time, so it was  completely monotonic, abnormally high-pitched, and very soft, with many of her early utterances completely silent and others so quiet that they sounded like [[whispering|whispers]].&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=150}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=90, 114–115}} Throughout 1971 her voice was extremely [[glottalization|glottalized]], and when she spoke she frequently pronounced only a few sounds; for instance, the word "doctor" sounded more like "dert". Despite knowing how to ask questions, she could only indicate them through facial expressions.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=22, 187}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|p=53}} Despite the lack of variability in her own voice, she clearly understood different tones of voice in other peoples' speech.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=100}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=55, 63–66}}

Like young children most of Genie's first words were [[monosyllabic]] consonant-vowel-(consonant) sequences, usually consisting of an unaspirated [[Bilabial stop]] or [[dental stop]] and a [[monophthong]]. But while most children's first disyllabic words also follow this pattern, hers had both consonant-vowel and vowel-consonant sequences.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; Unusually, from the very first disyllabic words Genie more fully articulated, except when referring to herself by her (real) name she immediately demonstrated proper stress patterns. For approximately two years the length of time she held out a vowel was her only stress indicator, and during that time was very exaggerated. People unfamiliar with her speech said she sounded either like a [[deaf]] child or someone with [[cerebral palsy]], although trained [[Speech-language pathology|speech pathologists]] only said the latter.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=22, 62, 71, 89, 187}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|p=53}}

===Early research team observations===
In December 1970 David Rigler procured a small grant from the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) to conduct preliminary studies on Genie, and in May 1971 Rigler organized and headed a team of doctors and scientists who sought and obtained a three-year grant from the NIMH to carry out a full [[Case study in psychology|case study]].&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=39, 51, 140}} The primary focus of their research was to test the hypothesis of [[Eric Lenneberg]] that humans have a [[critical period hypothesis|critical period]] for language acquisition, the end of which he defined as the onset of [[puberty]], and the [[innateness hypothesis]] of [[Noam Chomsky]], which contended that the ability to learn language is instinctive in humans and is what separates humans from all other animals. [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] linguistics professor [[Victoria Fromkin]] headed linguistic evaluation and organized a group of linguists to design and carry out their study. Shortly afterwards, in late May, Susan Curtiss began her work on Genie's case as a graduate student in linguistics under Fromkin.{{efn|Lenneberg stated that he did not have any desire to study Genie and declined to participate, saying no definite conclusions could be drawn because the level of trauma associated with Genie's childhood would be impossible to discern.}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=52–58, 121}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=216–217, 225–226}}

The relative lack of linguistic information on Genie from the previous six months left some ambiguities about the rate and timeline of Genie's early vocabulary and grammar acquisition.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=15, 23–26, 86, 93–110}} Curtiss and Fromkin quickly decided that Genie's linguistic abilities were not yet at a usefully testable level, so for the rest of Genie's stay at Children's Hospital Curtiss met with her almost every day for observations. They soon realized existing linguistic tests would not yield meaningful results, so although they also incorporated a few existing tests, including the [[Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test]], into their exams, they designed a set of 26 new tests from which they extrapolated most of their data.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=15}} Curtiss also wrote down every spontaneous utterance she heard from Genie, ultimately recording approximately a few thousand.&lt;ref name=Jones1995&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://smartsite.ucdavis.edu/access/content/group/d901cc36-2c8d-4d54-a276-43c295288927/Readings/Genie.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226170135/https://smartsite.ucdavis.edu/access/content/group/d901cc36-2c8d-4d54-a276-43c295288927/Readings/Genie.pdf | archivedate=February 26, 2014 | deadurl=no | title=Jones1995 and unanswered questions in the Genie case: a fresh look at the linguistic evidence | author=Jones, Peter E. | journal=Language and Communication | date=July 1995 | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=261–280 | doi=10.1016/0271-5309(95)00007-D | issn=0271-5309 | oclc=427070647 | accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|p=90}}

Curtiss quickly recognized Genie's nonverbal communication abilities, recalling several nonverbal interactions Genie had with strangers during that time. By this time Genie could name most of the things around her and had an estimated vocabulary of at least a few hundred words, consisting of a few verbs and adjectives and a large number of nouns. She was also extremely eager to expand her vocabulary, frequently grabbing Curtiss' hand and pointing it towards objects for which she wanted to know the word, and if Curtiss could not figure out exactly what Genie was looking for Genie refused to let go until she learned at least one new word.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=15, 20–22, 37–38, 94–110}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=23, 50–51, 86, 92–93}} Curtiss noted Genie's focus on objective properties, and especially her knowledge of color words, was very unusual because these require a level of cognitive sophistication not present in young children, suggesting she developed mental mechanisms for categorization during childhood. She had also clearly learned some basic principles of grammar, and understood more than she was producing.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=15, 94–110, 200}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=152–153}}

In early June 1971 Genie began to use her first words with two [[morpheme]]s and constructed her earliest two-word sentences, all of which were modifier-noun or noun-noun [[attributive]] constructions such as "More soup" or "Genie purse". A short time later, she began to produce noun-predicate adjective sentences such as "Dave sick".&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt; During this time, she never used [[Equative case|equational]] sentences characteristic of young children in this phase of development.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=189}} In addition, while most children form early two-word sentences with a few core words, which they attach to a wider variety of words, Curtiss never observed Genie doing this.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;

==First foster home==
In late June 1971 Genie moved into Jean Butler's home, where she stayed until early August. Butler was childless, and at the time lived alone. Soon after moving in with Butler Genie, who had turned 14 while living at Children's Hospital, showed the first signs of reaching puberty, definitively putting her past Lenneberg's proposed critical period.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=18}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=95–101}} The only linguistic information from anyone besides Butler during Genie's stay was that Genie formed some non-imitative two-word utterances in July, all without verbs and in [[noun phrase]]–noun phrase form, and that she gave her first imitations of a few unspecified three-word utterances.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=144–145}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=96–101, 106–107}}

Butler wrote that Genie rapidly became far more verbal and that the man she was dating, who moved in with her during Genie's stay and was a well known psychologist and retired [[University of Southern California]] professor, commented on Genie's talkativeness. She specifically claimed that she taught Genie to say "yes" to other people, to use negative word forms, and to express her anger through words or by hitting objects. Butler said Genie argued with her in late July and used negatives in her protestations, the first report of Genie using negatives in a sentence and of expressing disagreement in language.{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=102–103}} In an early August letter to Jay Shurley Butler wrote that Genie regularly used two-word sentences and sometimes produced three-word utterances, giving "one black kitty" as an example, containing two adjacent adjectives to describe nouns, and that in a recent conversation Genie extensively used negative words and sentences. Butler also reported that a few days prior, when she asked Genie why she threw her new pet goldfish outside, Genie explained, "bad orange fish—no eat—bad fish", which would have been by far her longest utterance to that point.{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=102–103}}

==August 1971–mid-1975==
In mid-August 1971, authorities removed Genie from Butler's house and returned her to Children's Hospital. Later the same day they transferred her to David Rigler's home, where she stayed for approximately four years. The Riglers had three adolescent children of their own, one of whom left for college shortly after Genie arrived. For the duration of Genie's stay Rigler's wife, Marilyn, was her teacher; Marilyn had graduate training as a social worker and had just completed a graduate degree in [[Human development (humanity)|human development]], and had previously worked in both [[nursery school]]s and [[Head Start Program]]s.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=106–108, 112, 116–117}} Immediately after Genie moved in with the Riglers, linguists resumed detailed observations.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;

===Brain exams===
Beginning in January 1971 scientists administered a series of [[neurolinguistics]] tests on Genie, making her the first language-deprived child to undergo any detailed brain examinations. Based on tests and observations in everyday situations, doctors concluded that she was [[right-handed]] and that her brain was extremely [[cerebral hemisphere|right-hemisphere]] dominant for all functions.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=214–218}} On tests specifically measuring Genie's language, her results were congruous with adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients. On a [[tachistoscope|tachistoscopic]] test in 1975, Genie had little difficulty when asked to point to words which [[rhyme]]. Genie also did very well on one [[evoked potential|evoked response]] test involving familiar [[homophone]]s, demonstrating that, similar to these patients, her receptive language comprehension was significantly better than her expressive comprehension.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=56, 212, 220–221}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=151}} An [[electroencephalography|EEG]] consistently picked up more activity from her right hemisphere than they did from the normal locations of the [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]] in a right-handed person, especially finding a high level of involvement from her right [[prefrontal cortex|anterior cerebral cortex]].{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=218–221}}

Based on these results the concluded that Genie's brain had completed [[cerebral lateralization|lateralization]] and that, because Genie had received no stimulation in her language center when she was a child, it had atrophied and her language functions had instead lateralized to her right hemisphere. Her results on their non-language tests suggested to them that her hemispheric dominance was not simply reversed.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=214–218}} They believed that Genie had been developing as a normal right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her, and attributed the extreme imbalance between Genie's left and right hemispheres to the fact that Genie's sensory stimulation as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt; Previous observations of right-hemisphere language acquisition in adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients consistently showed that both populations were much better at learning vocabulary, although they were able to learn some basic grammar. Linguists noted these subjects had an advantage over Genie because, unlike her, their right hemispheres had already acquired at least a small amount of basic language.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;

===Before testing===
When Genie first moved in with the Riglers she still scratched and cut herself when angry, and researchers wrote that her speech was much more halting and hesitant than Butler had described. She infrequently spoke, and for reasons they could not discern she almost always a several minutes delay in her responses to speech. Typically she did not seem to listen to anyone unless she was being directly addressed and typically walked away from somebody who was speaking to her, and while she would stay with someone if specifically asked she rarely seemed attuned to what the person was saying.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=33, 144–145}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=112–117}} In contrast to Butler's writings the scientists wrote that Genie only rarely used two-word sentences, and prior to  October 1971 they were all modifier-noun sentences, sentences indicating possession—none containing the possessive '' 's '' marker—or the two words of a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] noun such as "number five". For the first few months linguists did not record any utterances longer than two words, and wrote that she did not use any negative sentences.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=33, 144–145}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=112–117}}

Marilyn taught Genie to take her frustration out on inanimate objects in their yard and worked to verbally deescalate her, and as Genie learned more language she began to gain more control over her responses to situations that upset her. By the end of her stay with the Riglers she could gesture to indicate her level of anger, either vigorously shaking one finger or loosely waving her hand depending on whether she was very angry or merely frustrated.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=40–41}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=113, 117–118}} In mid-October 1971 Curtiss was reading Genie a story when she saw Genie was clearly listening and responding, and from then on Genie paid attention to people talking even when they were not speaking directly to or about her.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=33}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=115–116}} As she settled down with the Riglers she began to talk somewhat more, and her response time began to improve, but she continued to speak significantly less than most children in similar phases of language learning.{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=100}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=27}}

During this time the scientists observed that, unlike young children, Genie would never use any piece of grammar before complete comprehension.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=202–203}} She also never spoke with the excessive specificity and overly marked words, such as "tooked", that are characteristic of people in this phase of language acquisition.{{sfn|Curtiss|1988a|p=287}} Furthermore, whereas children typically begin to use two-word phrases when their vocabulary is about 50 words, Genie only began to do so after she could use and understand about 200, matching the timeline previously observed in children with various types of [[aphasia]].&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt; Curtiss also noted that when Genie used the word ''dog'' to describe any dog but not other animals, indicating she understood how to use generic terms, and that upon learning the name of the Riglers' dog she recognized that name was specific to him.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; In 1978, language psychologist [[Susan Goldin-Meadow]] suggested Genie's lack of overgeneralization may have been due to differences between the mind of a young child versus an adolescent as opposed to the properties of early language acquisition.&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://goldin-meadow-lab.uchicago.edu/PDF/1978/GM_1978.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612154805/http://goldin-meadow-lab.uchicago.edu/PDF/1978/GM_1978.pdf | archivedate=June 12, 2010 | title=A Study in Human Capacities | author=Goldin-Meadow, Susan | authorlink=Susan Goldin-Meadow | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=May 1978 | volume=200 | issue=4342 | doi=10.1126/science.200.4342.649 | pmid=17812701 | issn=0036-8075 | oclc=4633223637 | pages=649–651 | accessdate=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had many more [[action verb]]s than normal in her early vocabulary.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=201}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=127–128}}

At first Genie did not use negative word forms but soon showed comprehension of them, an ability previously observed in split-brain and adult left-hemispherectomy patients, albeit much more consistently with the word ''not'' and [[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]] ''n't'' than the [[prefix]] ''un''. Instead of learning negatives through the three-step process which linguists believed young children did, she appeared to have learned every kind of negation at once.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=102, 201–202}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt; In September and October 1971 she began incorporating verbs into her two-word utterances, such as, "Dave hurt", although at first she never included the first person [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and inconsistently included any subject.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; Although Genie's two-word sentences contained grammatical properties typical of young children she was much better at labeling and describing emotions and concrete objects, especially colors, sizes, and qualities, and most of her earliest two-word sentences modified nouns. Taken with her distinction between general and subordinate terms, this strongly indicated a focus on physical characteristics to a degree not seen in most children.&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=189, 200}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1994|p=228}}

===During testing===
Curtiss began active testing of Genie's language in October 1971, when she and Fromkin decided her linguistic abilities had advanced to the point where they would yield usable results. Their tests measured both Genie's vocabulary and her acquisition of various aspects of grammar, including [[syntax]], [[phonology]], and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and Curtiss conducted the primary analysis of the results.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=145–151}} At first the tests were deliberately short, only looking for six to eight responses per test, and over the course of testing they gradually increased in duration.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=38, 40, 121}} When Curtiss began testing Genie usually did not actively resist but never initiated tests and only did the absolute least amount required, which Curtiss attributed to Genie simply being lazy, making the first year of testing extremely difficult. As Curtiss continued Genie grew to largely enjoy being tested and was typically much more willing to participate, though she still usually continued to less than she was capable of and sometimes playfully gave deliberately wrong answers, and on some occasions would even indicate that she wanted to take the tests.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=28, 38, 121}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=114–115, 184–185}}

Upon commencing her tests Curtiss found that although Genie's comprehension was clearly ahead of her production, it was only slightly ahead.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=150–153}} Genie had begun to diversify her two-word utterances to include sentences in either subject-[[verb]] or verb-[[object (grammar)|object]] order, suggesting she was grasping the [[subject–verb–object]] sentence structure typically used in English, and could follow other basic word order rules as evidenced in her verb-[[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] sentences. While Genie did not use [[English plural|plural]] forms of words and could not distinguish between plural and [[singular number|singular]] words or [[inflection]]s, by October 1971 she clearly distinguished between one versus more than one object and understood numbers and [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantitative descriptors]].&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=144–145}} She also started using some regular [[past tense]] forms of [[Germanic weak verbs|weak verbs]]. On tests she consistently did better recognizing and responding to the [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]] of irregular past tense verbs and [[Germanic strong verb|strong verbs]], but she only started to use these forms, either in imitation or in spontaneous speech, in 1973, and they remained limited.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=118}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|pp=98–100}}

In a conference presentation during 1972 Fromkin said that by November 1971 Genie's speech was, "strictly rule-governed", and that her grammar at that time was similar to a typical 18- to 20-month-old.{{sfn|Rymer|1993|p=119}} In November 1971 Genie began forming noun-[[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] two-word utterances, such as "stocking white". Genie had also begun using the [[genitive case]] in some of her two-word sentences around this time, with many of these sentences, such as "Marilyn bike", indicating possession. In all of these early possessive sentences, she entirely relied on word order.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;

November 1971 was also the time that Genie produced her first spontaneous three- to four-word utterances, although they were extremely uncommon at first. All were either modifier–noun sentences such as "little white clear box", subject–verb–object sentences in noun–verb–noun form such as "Tori chew glove", or verb–noun phrase sentences, and some, such as "Small two cup", clearly demonstrated these were not imitations. In them she used grammar which the scientists thought she knew but could not previously confirm, including the first-person subject in sentences such as "Genie love Curtiss", and could incorporate what would have been a modifier-noun or [[English possessive|possessive]] utterance into a longer sentence, further convincing linguists that she understood subject–verb–object word order.{{efn|Curtiss wrote that Genie referred to her by her last name.}}&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=32–33, 146, 193–194}} Some utterances from this time until the end of 1973, such as "Elevator hurt silly goose", were completely unintelligible, and a few of these, such as "Angry burn stove", were subject–subject–subject sentences previously observed in children with various language disorders.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=163, 194}} Whereas most children progress beyond two-word sentences after four to six weeks, it took Genie five months to do so.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morford/&gt;{{sfn|Aitchison|1989|p=79}}

On tests between November 1971 and May 1972 Curtiss determined that Genie viewed non-specific adjectives describing size, such as ''little'' as absolute rather than relative values without superlative or comparative markers. Between January and May 1972 her comprehension of noun-modifier sentences significantly increased and starting in May 1972, after Curtiss replaced the word ''little'' with ''tiny'', Genie showed clear comprehension of them.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=103–104}} Genie clearly understood both the word ''more'' and the [[suffix]] ''-er'' as [[comparative]]s by January 1972, but never used them in her own speech. Prior to 1972 Genie responded to the [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] ''and'' and ''or'' as if they both meant ''and'', but even after recognizing there was a difference never fully grasped the meaning of ''or''. On tests she showed perfect comprehension of ''and'' while correctly responding to the word ''or'' fewer than 10% of the time, but she always understood [[Disjunct (linguistics)|disjunction]] marked by the word ''or'' in everyday conversation. She never attempted to use any other conjunctions, and with one possible highly ungrammatical exception never tried to connect two sentences.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=112, 137, 160}}

Before December 1971 Genie could only use one noun in a sentence, but beginning in early 1972 Genie could form increasingly complex [[noun phrase]]s.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; In early 1972, Genie began combining verbs to form two-word verbs in her sentences; most of these were two-word utterances requesting an action, such as "Leave on", but at least once in early November 1973 she included a two-word verb in part of a longer sentence.{{efn|Curtiss distinguished these from previous two-word verbs because Genie had treated the earlier verbs as one word.}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=156–157}} She also began using two consecutive verbs in some of her three and four word utterances.{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=149}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=156–157}} By this time she could also use two-word noun phrases, such as "piece wood", in different contexts, but a later analysis by linguist [[Derek Bickerton]] speculated that she treated all of these as single words in her vocabulary.{{sfn|Bickerton|1990|pp=116–117}} Genie's first [[locative case|locative]] sentences also appeared around this time, all of which were two or three words, always in either noun-noun or verb-noun form with one of the nouns being a locative noun, and contained no prepositions, and the scientists simultaneously observed her first [[verb phrase]] constructions.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=153, 156–157}}

Throughout January and February 1972 Genie more consistently using-word subject–verb and verb–object utterances, which linguists viewed as confirmation that she had mastered English word order. During this time she began to use the [[preposition]]s ''in'' and ''on'', the first words she used to exclusively serve a grammatical purpose, although she did not always include them and all of her early uses were in answers to questions.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|pp=99–100}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=144–145, 153}} When Curtiss tested her on possessive sentences such as "Point to the cat's foot" and "Point to the foot of the cat" during this time Genie was only correct 50% of the time, but after March of that year she demonstrated full comprehension of both constructions despite not using either in her speech. In February 1972 she produced negative sentences, all consisting of "No more" appended to the beginning of either a noun or a noun and a verb which could have been an independent utterance.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|pp=98–100}}

In the spring of 1972 Genie began to spontaneously use the definite [[article (grammar)|article]] ''the'', marking the first [[determiner]] in her speech, but for several months almost exclusively used it in imitation.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=103–104, 147}} In April and May 1972, by which time she was steadily increasing the complexity of her verb phrases, she began using these with similarly expanded noun phrases. In May she also began using the verb ''have'' in possessive sentences, i.e., "Miss Fromkin have blue car." The following month she began to use "No more" with only a verb, such as "No more have", to form negative sentences, always at the beginning of what could have been an independent utterance.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=153, 156–157}}

During July 1972 the scientists noted Genie's first verb-verb phrase sentences, such as "Like chew meat", and she then quickly began using complex verbs with complex noun phrases, as in the utterance "Want buy toy refrigerator".&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; By this Genie still showed no comprehension of regular plurals, so in her first active attempt to teach Genie grammar Curtiss created a test to help her learn them. By August 1972 Genie mastered them, in contrast with earlier observations of people acquiring language in their right hemispheres who never learned any singular/plural distinction.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=153, 156–157}} After that time she used them in imitation, although she only used regular plurals in five undated spontaneous utterances despite practice with pronouncing a final ''s'', and never used any irregular plurals.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=110–112, 168–169, 239, 241}}&lt;ref name=Morford&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.unm.edu/~morford/images/Morford_2003_Linguistics.pdf | title=Grammatical development in adolescent first-language learners | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523024758/http://www.unm.edu/~morford/images/Morford_2003_Linguistics.pdf | archivedate=May 23, 2013 | deadurl=no | journal=[[Linguistics (journal)|Linguistics]] | date=July 1, 2003 | author=Morford, Jill P. | authorlink=Jill Morford | volume=41 | issue=4 | pages=681–721 | doi=10.1515/ling.2003.022 | issn=0024-3949 | oclc=356994249 | accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 1972 Genie could use the word ''on'', although it was uncertain whether she distinguished between ''on'' and ''in'' and Curtiss wrote that all of Genie's earliest utterances containing ''on'' and ''in'' were answers to somebody asking her a question, and could correctly use the suffix ''-ing'' to describe events in the [[present progressive]]. These were the first grammatical [[Marker (linguistics)|markers]] in her speech, and both are normally two of the first grammatical markers young children can use.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|pp=99–100}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=153}} Her use of ''-ing'' on exclusively [[dynamic verb]]s also indicated to linguists that she categorized dynamic versus [[stative verb]]s, although she did not use it with the verb ''to be'' until the fall of 1973 and then only when speaking in first or third-person. Even after learning the present progressive she inconsistently gave correct responses to it on tests, and use of the suffix ''-ing'' was the only way Genie modified a sentence without changing any of the base words. Although Genie had gained some understanding of number words during her initial stay at Children's Hospital she only began to [[counting|count]] in sequential order in late 1972, always in very deliberate and laborious manner, and her progress was extremely slow.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=159, 165, 173, 181–182, 196, 222}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=151–153}}

In December 1972, after Curtiss and Genie had accidentally been locked out of the Riglers' home, Curtiss said to Genie, "Tell them [David and Marilyn Rigler] what happened" and Genie pointed to the door and said, "Tell door lock"; this indicated her language included [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursion]], which they considered an especially important development. The scientists interpreted another utterance from 1973, "Ask David see swing", as both further confirmation she had grasped recursion and the first [[complex sentence]] she produced.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=99}} By this time she understood and used [[intensifier]]s such as the word ''very'', but only tenuously grasped [[superlative]]s. She never used them in her own speech but appeared to understand them, and while she was generally better with the suffix ''-est'' than with the word ''most'' Curtiss thought Genie might not have known the actual meaning of ''-est''. The contrast between her understanding and lack of production of superlatives furthered the researchers' belief that, even in the absence of language, her cognition had developed in some form.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=114–115}}

In early 1973 Genie started using [[Article (grammar)#definite article|definite articles]] in imitative utterances, such as "In the backyard". By this time she had also gained the ability to spontaneously use the prepositions ''next to'', ''beside'', ''behind'', ''in'', ''at'', ''front'', and ''after''.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|pp=99–100}} However, until 1975 she exclusively used ''at'' in the phrase ''at school'', leading Curtiss to believe ''at school'' was one word in her vocabulary, and Genie inconsistently understood other prepositions such as ''behind'', ''over'', and ''in front of''. Curtiss wrote that on tests Genie frequently mistook both ''behind'' and ''in back of'' for ''in front of'', though by 1977 her understanding of ''behind'' on tests had substantially improved. By contrast, on non-test settings Genie's responses to ''in front of'', ''behind'', ''in back of'', and ''under'' generally indicated comprehension; unlike most children, who learn ''under'' well before the other three, she had somewhat more difficulty with ''under''.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=107–110, 140–141, 151–153}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=151}}

In March 1973 Genie seemed unable to grasp ''on'' or ''under'' on one test, even though she had correctly used ''on'' in non-test settings, but the scientists suggested this was because of logistical difficulties unique to that test.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; On a different test Genie at first gave correct responses to ''on'' 48% of the time, and her confusion was mostly with the words ''in'' or ''under'', but by September 1973 she showed full comprehension of both ''in'' and ''on''.{{efn|In late 1973 she temporarily used the word ''in'' for both ''in'' and ''on'', but Curtiss believed she simply merged the sounds and did not actually confuse the words.}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=107–108, 154}} Soon afterward she began consistently including ''a'' in noun phrases, and eventually used both articles and the words ''and'' and ''more'' in noun phrases.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=148}} In the early spring of that year she began to use the determiner ''another'' and started occasionally including prepositions and determiners in [[adverbial phrase]]s, such as, "In hospital, shot hurt arm".{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=99}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=107–108, 154}} Genie's acquisition of [[locative adverb]]s came before she learned ones for either time or manner, which was normal, but although she started to use time adverbs a few months later she never used any manner adverbs.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=200–201}}

By April 1973 Genie began regularly using [[verb particle]]s in her spontaneous utterances, frequently using phrases such as "put back" and "take off" , and began using [[imperative mood|imperative]] sentences using the [[vocative case]].{{efn|Prior to using imperative sentences, to tell someone what to do Genie would grab a person's face and orient it towards her own, and the person had to determine what Genie wanted based on gestures or other context.}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=99}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=157, 232}} Researchers noted she began using imperatives much later in the language acquisition process than normal and that they remained very infrequent, and considered either her emotional difficulties or lack of [[self-concept]] possible explanations. By mid-1973 Genie had begun to include indirect objects in her sentences, such as "Curtiss give me valentine", and could use definite and indefinite articles but never distinguished between the two.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=99}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=147–148, 171, 198}} In addition, whereas most people learn to use [[demonstrative]]s and numbers at the same time, she never used these in her early spontaneous noun phrases, and in 1977 Curtiss noted that Genie had never used any demonstratives. In the fall of 1973 Genie began correctly using the verb ''has'' as the [[third person singular]] form of the verb ''to have'', but continued not to conjugate it in most situations and never used any other third person singular forms, so linguists suggested she may have learned it as a separate word instead of a conjugation.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=147–148, 171, 198}}

In October 1973, in addition to forming negative sentences with the phrase ''No more'' Genie began to use the word "No" by itself. For both she still appended the negation to the beginning of an otherwise unaltered utterance, which was the normal first step for children learning negation.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|pp=99–100}}{{sfn|Aitchison|1989|p=79}} About a week later, she started using the word ''not'' in the same manner in sentences and showed clear understanding of more complex forms of negation.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=147–148}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=130}} But while children usually quickly progress to saying "I not" and then "I do not", and then learn to use contractions, Genie did not move past this stage until early 1975.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978&gt;{{cite journal | title=Language development in the mature (minor) right hemisphere | url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/curtiss/1978%20-%20Language%20development%20in%20the%20mature%20%28minor%29%20right%20hemisphere.pdf | first1=Susan | last1=Curtiss | first2=Victoria A. | last2=Fromkin |  first3=Stephen D. | last3=Krashen | journal=[[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Journal of Applied Linguistics]] | year=1978 | volume=39–40 | issue=1 | pages=23–27 | accessdate=April 30, 2013 | doi=10.1075/itl.39-40.02cur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1979&gt;{{cite journal | title=Genie: language and cognition | author=Curtiss, Susan | journal=UCLA Working Papers in Cognitive Linguistics | year=1979 |issue=1 | pages=15–62 | oclc=48750479}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, despite clearly understanding the negative prefix ''un-'' by this time Genie never used it in her speech.{{sfn|Curtiss|1988a|pp=}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=178}}

=====Early pronoun comprehension=====
Starting in September 1972 Curtiss spent a great deal of time testing Genie's acquisition of [[pronoun]]s and at first found that Genie strenuously resisted, often refusing to respond or clearly guessing, until becoming more receptive to them in late 1973.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=121}} By December 1972 Genie understood and spontaneously used the pronoun ''I'', pronouncing it with more [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] for emphasis, but almost exclusively used it with the words ''want'' or ''like'' and still frequently referred to herself by name. She did not show any comprehension of any other pronouns besides ''you'' and ''me'', which she interchangeably used; Genie would often say, "Mama love you" while pointing to herself, which Curtiss attributed to a manifestation of Genie's inability to distinguish who she was from who someone else was.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=121–122}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|p=124}} Genie did not spontaneously use any other pronouns or use pronominal forms in her speech, although by 1973 she clearly understood the [[reciprocal pronoun]] ''each other''.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=121}}

In 1973 and early 1974 Genie identified possessive pronouns, such as ''his'', ''your'', and ''my'', with less than 50% accuracy.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; By 1973 she began to use the possessive pronoun ''my'', making ''my'' and the possessive pronoun ''her'' the only possessive pronouns she learned. Curtiss wrote that this comprehension was not total, and was at least partially predicated on the method of testing.{{efn|When not looking at the pictures Curtiss used for this test Genie often misinterpreted the word ''her'' as either ''my'' or ''your'', but when looking at the pictures she only mistook it for the word ''his''.}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|pp=99–100}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=113}} On another test from this time on [[reflexive pronoun]]s, such as "The boy is feeding himself", she got more wrong than right but did somewhat better on sentences using [[object pronoun]]s, such as "He is feeding him".&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=150}} Curtiss also recorded Genie using the word ''it'' twice, but only in sentences that were, for all practical purposes, imitative utterances.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=192–193}}

=====Interrogative questions=====
Prior to January 1972, if someone asked Genie a question using the [[interrogative word]] ''where'' she invariably responded by saying the last word of the speaker's sentence. In early January 1972 she began to give accurate, grammatical responses to ''where'' questions in conversations.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=153}} By February 1972, in everyday interactions Genie clearly understood and appropriately acted on most questions using the interrogative words ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', ''when'', ''why'', ''which'', and ''how''.{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=151–152}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|pp=100–101}} Unlike most children, who grasp ''who'', ''what'', ''which'', and ''where'' questions much earlier than ''when'', ''how'', or ''why'' questions, the only one of these which took longer for Genie understand was ''why'' and even this took much less time than linguists expected. Because the latter group of questions require more cognitive sophistication to properly answer, the scientists offered this as additional proof that Genie had a higher level of cognitive functioning than most children in similar phases of language acquisition.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=153}}

Despite this, on most simple test questions such as "Who is the girl pulling?" or "What is the red box on?" Genie did not react or reply to test questions at all. When she did respond she clearly had no understanding of the sentence and gave completely ungrammatical and nonsensical answers, either stating the answer in the question, attempting to fuse two separate questions into one, or attempting to state a declarative sentence as a question. She also remained entirely unable to ask an interrogative question in conversation, only ever attempting to upon specific request, and efforts during mid-1973 to help her memorize interrogative questions were completely unsuccessful.{{efn|The scientists wrote that to make requests she would usually either point to something, use facial expressions, or repeat what appeared to be a declarative sentence until someone recognized it was intended as a question.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=140, 164}} Curtiss theorized this inability was because Genie had no [[deixis]] or linguistic movement in her speech, and in 1975 the scientists speculated emotional difficulties may have made her unwilling to attempt them in spontaneous speech. Curtiss attributed Genie's failure to memorize them to being generally unable to remember sentences using grammar she had not mastered, which is typical of young children. After seeing how much trouble the tests gave Genie Curtiss ended them, and after approximately a year people stopped asking her to produce these questions.{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=151–152}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=140, 163–164}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=101}}

From October 1973 to January 1974, on simple past tense sentences such as, "The girl opened the umbrella" Genie was only correct 50% of the time, but was almost perfect with past tense completive sentences marked with the verb ''finish'', such as "The girl finished opening the umbrella."{{efn|Curtiss deliberately added the latter element after Genie had begun learning sign language, as linguists already knew that children learning American Sign Language learned to comprehend and use the completive past tense aspect much more quickly than children learning spoken English.}}&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=116–117, 172}} It was unclear if she learned to use irregular past tense verbs, as all of her utterances in which she used them were either imitations or responses to questions containing them.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=116–117, 172}} Curtiss also used this test to gauge Genie's knowledge of the [[future tense]], and found she showed almost perfect comprehension of the [[going-to future]] construction but showed no understanding of sentences with an identical semantic meaning but using the [[auxiliary verb]] ''will''; by contrast, children almost always correctly respond to both. The scientists wrote her lack of comprehension or use of auxiliary structures, despite understanding identical messages phrased with inflected words, was consistent with her ability to grasp conceptual information far better than grammar.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=149}}

At the end of 1973 and into early 1974 Genie's locative sentences underwent considerable expansion, as she produced utterances such as, "Like good Harry at hospital".&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt; In a few sentences from this time she began to incorporate the words of other people into her own utterances, as in "Dentist say drink water"; direct quotations would remain the only situation in which she could engage in any embedding of elements of language, and these remained very rare.{{efn|There was some question among the scientists over one utterance, "Marilyn said not lift my leg in the dentist chair"; since Genie sometimes confused ''my'' and ''your'', linguists were unsure if she was trying to explain what Marilyn said to her or if she had only reversed the pronouns while quoting Marilyn.}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=152, 159, 172}} On one occasion in early February 1974 she used the [[iterative aspect]] via [[reduplication]] in the utterance "Tomorrow big, big prize hula hoop". As this kind of reduplication is much more commonly expressed through the word ''very'', Curtiss found Genie's use of it abnormal.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=160}}

By early 1974 the scientists estimated that Genie's grammar was congruous with a typical two or two and a half year old, although her progress remained unusually slow. Around  this time Curtiss found that, unlike most children but similar to adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients, she was completely unable to distinguish between [[active voice|active]] and [[passive voice]], giving random responses to these sentences and never gaining any use of the passive voice.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt; In these sentences Genie would often, though not always, confuse the subject and object, contrasting with her ability to process subject–verb–object sentences in other contexts and her own subject–verb–object sentences, but these reversals were only with certain pronouns and became significantly less common by January 1974. On a test between February 1974 to July 1975, Genie also showed no comprehension of the words ''many'', ''most'', ''few'', or ''fewest''.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=124–125, 134–135}}

In the late spring of 1974 Genie began to use the phrase ''no more'' to represent its common lexical meaning, as demonstrated in the utterance "No more penny".{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=150–151}} During May 1974 Curtiss recorded Genie's first compound noun phrases, which were the only times Genie would use the word ''and''. At the same time Curtiss noted Genie's first [[compound sentence]]s, but with one possible exception, the utterance "I want save money buy two rectangle box" dated early October 1974, she did not use any compound verb phrases.{{efn|Because Genie had not included the word ''and'', Curtiss wrote it was unclear whether the sentence truly contained a compound verb phrase or if it was a for–to complement sentence.}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=148, 160, 175}} During this time Genie also used a few verb [[infinitive]]s in her speech, in all instances clearly treating them as one word, and began adding the pronoun ''my'' to her possessive sentences and using the marker '' 's '' to indicate possession.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=148, 159–160, 175, 183}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=99}} Curtiss also noted that Genie never confused [[gender]], although she only marked it through gender-specific nouns.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=201}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=127–128}}

In both test settings and conversations Genie still sometimes reversed ''I'' and ''you'', ''my'' and ''your'', and ''me'' and ''you'', but during the summer of 1974 she began to show definite improvement in both her comprehension and production of first and second person pronouns. In August she started to demonstrate the ability to modify first subject and then object pronouns. By mid-1975, her confusion of ''me'' versus ''you'' and ''my'' versus ''your'' was much less frequent. Curtiss also noted Genie starting to use the [[benefactive case]] during this time, although she did not always include the word ''for''.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=140–142, 179}}

Genie also understood ''self'' and ''selves'' as reflexive pronoun markers, and in most scenarios she understood reflexive pronouns. The exception was when she encountered a noun phrase with a pronoun she misunderstood; for instance, if given the sentence, "He is feeding himself", she frequently confused ''he'' with ''she'' and therefore changed ''himself'' to ''herself''.{{efn|Curtiss noted that in sentences with noun phrases entirely consisting of nouns Genie only reversed the pronouns once, and on that occasion quickly corrected herself, meaning that for the pronoun tests she used a word order strategy.}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=148, 150}} In sentences with reciprocals or the reflexive pronoun ''themselves'' she appeared to understand the pronoun ''they'', but never used it in her own speech; Curtiss thought Genie was likely guessing the meaning from context, as Genie could discern plurality from the elements of the sentences using it. Her pronoun acquisition was described at that time as "painfully slow", but researchers insisted there was definite progress. There were certain pronouns, such as object pronouns or the word [[English grammar#There as pronoun|''there'' as a pronoun]], that Genie never used or understood.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=122–123, 152}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=148–150}}

In the fall of 1974 Genie produced a few utterances with internal negatives, although she had specifically practiced all but two of these early sentences and one of the spontaneous occurrences was a partial imitation, and these sentences grew more common until she completely mastered their use by early 1975. Curtiss did not view this as linguistic movement, believing that Genie's grammar simply changed to place negations in the middle of a sentence.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=110, 151–155}} By the fall of 1974 Genie began differentiating between third-person pronouns such as ''he'' and ''she'', but still had a high rate of error and did not use these, [[relative pronoun]]s, and [[indefinite pronoun]]s.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=148}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=140–141, 191}} She had used locatives after subject noun phrases for a long time, but only did so after an object phrase in late 1974. At around the same time she had begun to use more than one [[Adpositional phrase|prepositional phrase]] in some sentences, and in the spring of 1975 she fully comprehended the preposition ''between'' on tests.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=110, 151–156, 198–199}}

In 1975 Genie began to use a different type of serial verb construction, in sentences such as "I like go ride Miss F. car". Curtiss noted that all of these were first-person utterances, that she almost never said the word ''I'', and that she frequently used standalone verbs, such as ''go'', which typically precede a second verb; although in several cases she said ''go ride'' and ''go walk'', Curtiss thought Genie may have treated these as single words and were therefore not as complicated as they appeared. In addition, all of these sentences were in verb–(verb–verb phrase) form which Curtiss argued had no hierarchical structure, although an outside analysis argued they had contained some degree of hierarchy.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=156, 198–199}} In non-test settings during early 1975 Genie gave some indications, including one verbal response to David Rigler, that she grasped [[conditional sentence]]s, but Curtiss said she could not be completely certain. Curtiss also noted that, despite the fact that Genie clearly understood contractions, she did not use any in her speech.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=131, 142, 190, 249}}

By at least 1975 Genie clearly understood and incorporated the concept of [[temporality]] into her speech, and unusually for people acquiring a first language she understood the words ''before'' and ''after'' before learning past or future tense markers. She could also use sentences to indicate [[causality|causation]], albeit without saying the words ''if'' and ''then''.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=119, 184}} Despite this, by 1975 Genie remained largely unable to respond to sentences where the nouns were not in the same sequence as the events, such as "Touch your ear after you touch your nose", although she improved more with sentences asking her to do something ''after'' instead of doing something ''before''.{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=148, 151–152}} In a 1981 paper Curtiss interpreted Genie's temporal utterances as an expansion of Genie's vocabulary, but an outside analysis of Curtiss' writings concluded that Genie had to have acquired some degree of grammar to have formed these sentences.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;

When first asked to distinguish between ''all'', ''some'', and ''one'' Genie would interpret ''some'' to mean ''all'', but by 1975 she reversed this and began mistaking ''some'' for ''one'', which Curtiss interpreted as a sign of progress.{{efn|Curtiss noted two complicating factors on this test. She thought one of the pictures she used may have been confusing for Genie, and that unlike most of Curtiss' other tests Genie had a 50% chance of getting a correct answer just from guessing.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=131}}}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=149}} This contrasted with her distinction between ''more'' and ''less'', which she had demonstrated by at least August 1973, and her understanding of the [[grammatical modifier|qualifiers]] ''one'' and ''all'' in everyday conversations.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=136}} When learning relative terms such as ''large'' and ''small'' or ''narrow'' and ''wide'' she simultaneously learned both words in the pair, whereas most people acquire either the marked or the negative form first, and never mistakenly used one term in a pair to mean the other. Although she had difficulty with different pairs of relative and relational terms on tests, she showed significantly greater comprehension outside of test settings.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=131, 136, 190}}

In early 1975 Genie began to use a type of ungrammatical sentence with a subject–verb–(object or subject)–verb–({subject or object}–verb) construction. Curtiss wrote that some of these sentences could have been grammatically correct if they included relative pronouns, but that others looked like two separate sentences which Genie had simply combined while removing some of the nouns. At around the same time Genie also began to produce ungrammatical sentences containing a copula, first with utterances such as "Is Akron" and later including verbs without the ''-ing'' suffix such as "Boy is pinch". Curtiss wrote that approximately one half of these types of ungrammatical sentences were Genie's responses to people who told her to, "speak in sentences", which she would interpret as being asked to include a form of ''to be'' in a sentence. Curtiss noted that Genie also produced some grammatical sentences with copulas, such as "Glass is clear".&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=159–160, 164–165}}

Despite mastering word order, Genie still had difficulty with distinguishing between simple actor–action–object sentences. In 1975, when given the sentences "The girl pulls the boy" or "The boy pulls the girl" and asked to point to the corresponding picture, her answers would either be all correct or all incorrect. While this was progress from 1971 and 1972, when she simply guessed, this indicated that she was attempting to use a word order strategy but could not ascertain a specific formula. Her difficulty with this also manifested itself in her inability to use word order to tell the difference between sentences such as, "What is on the blue box?" and, "What is the blue box on?". In addition to the disparity with the results on pronoun and relative clause tests, in which she used word order strategies, researchers wrote this was a major contrast with the clear word order rules in her spontaneous speech.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=147–148, 151–153}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=165, 222}}

By early 1975 Genie showed comprehension of simple and complex sentences where the object was the [[relative clause]], such as "The boy is looking at the girl who is frowning", or sentences where the subject was the relative clause and did not end in a noun phrase, such as "The boy who is frowning is looking at the girl".{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=147–148}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=130}} However, when interpreting a complex sentence in which a relative clause ending in a noun phrase came before the main verb, such as "The boy who is looking at the girl is frowning", she interpreted the noun closest to the verb as the subject. The scientists wrote that this meant that she was using a word order strategy, which they considered progress because her earlier responses to them were clearly guesses.{{efn|Scientists wrote this supported a hypothesis, first proposed in 1970, that children steadily improve comprehension of these sentences for approximately four years before temporarily perceiving the first noun as the subject and the second as the object in all cases.}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=147–149}} By this time Genie could only consistently count as high as 7 in sequential order, which came at the expense of her ability to do so via gestalt perception.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=147–148, 151–153}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=222}}

By 1975 Genie demonstrated full comprehension of several paired words, such as ''long'' and ''short'' or ''high'' and ''low''. Most of the time she learned both words in a pair at the same time, and in a few cases learned either the negative or the marked word in the pair first; for instance, she learned the word ''narrow'' before ''wide'' and ''few'' before ''many''. For some paired words, such as ''left'' and ''right'', her answers on tests were still less than 100% even by 1977 consistently showed the same level of understanding for each word. However, Genie never made any distinction between the words ''here'' and ''there''; on multiple tests, when told to come or go to a person or area her response to either, "Come here" and, "Go there" was always to go to either the closest or the farthest person or area.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=131, 134}}

When Genie left the Riglers' house in mid-1975, at the age of 18, she had acquired a degree of vocabulary and grammar far greater than that observed in non-human subjects. In June of that year, David Rigler wrote that she continued to make significant strides in every field which the scientists were testing.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt; Despite the marked improvement in Genie's language, it was still clearly abnormal. The words she learned continued to remain far ahead of the grammar she possessed and still showed an unusual focus on objective properties, and the gap between her receptive and expressive vocabulary had grown. While her use and comprehension of grammar had clearly improved, and papers from the time indicated she was continuing to acquire it, they were still highly deficient and her progress remained far slower than linguists had anticipated. And how much of what she did use was attributable to acquisition versus rote memory was not readily obvious.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=150–153}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=165}}

=====Auxiliary structure=====
Despite Genie's grammar acquisition, her speech remained entirely devoid of [[pro-form]]s, [[modal verb]]s, [[modal particle]]s, or auxiliary verbs. She memorized a few ritual phrases containing auxiliary structures but only used them in very specific ways, so linguists did not consider these grammar acquisition.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=30, 165, 190, 199}} In the spring of 1974 Curtiss thought Genie may have acquired use of the contractible auxiliary ''you'', but wrote that she only used it in sentences that were mostly imitative. In January 1974 the scientists noted the first [[Copula (linguistics)|copulas]] in her spontaneous sentences, but she never used a contractible copula.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=30, 165, 199}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=151}} By early 1975 Genie had started including [[do-support]] in some of her sentences, such as the utterance "I do not have a red pail", but only in negative sentences with memorized phrases, almost exclusively the phrase ''I do not have'', causing Curtiss to speculate that Genie had simply memorized the words "I do" as an independent phrase.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=152, 190}}{{sfn|Bickerton|1990|p=117}} Even then, Genie frequently omitted or incorrectly used it.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=152, 190}}

===Conversational abilities===
During everyday interactions with other people Genie inconsistently applied what linguistic abilities she possessed, although her use of both vocabulary and grammar remained better in imitation than in her own spontaneous speech.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=136}} Her ability and willingness to engage in verbal interactions steadily increased during her stay with the Riglers, and she used her language to serve a progressively larger number of functions. Nonetheless, she continued to speak very little, and when she did talk it was almost always in utterances significantly shorter than she was actually able to spontaneously produce. Because of this, the scientists wrote that it was extremely difficult to analyze her comprehension and use of grammar in conversations.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=145–147}}

Unusually for a first language learner, Genie never engaged in any kind of experimentation with language.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=185–186}} Sometimes if Genie mastered an aspect of grammar she would not use it in everyday interactions, such as imperatives, and with many others, such as past tense or plural words, she only used the correct words or markers if separately and specifically asked.&lt;ref name=Morford/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=31, 158, 168–169, 232}}{{sfn|Bickerton|1990|p=117}} If someone asked Genie a yes or no question she often repeated part of the question or said "no" even if she clearly meant yes and shook her head the correct way, which Curtiss concluded was Genie simply repeating the last word of the sentence.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; By contrast, she frequently understood and responded to highly complex questions that she could not on tests, especially sentences requiring some degree of [[inference]] and sentences performing both a [[Locutionary act|locutionary]] and [[illocutionary act]].&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt; Her comprehension of other complex sentences remained inconsistent, although beginning in November 1973 researchers recorded slow but noticeable improvement.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=131, 142, 168–169, 190, 249}}{{sfn|Bickerton|1990|p=117}}

The scientists also measured Genie's conversational competence. Most verbal interactions with her consisted either of someone asking her a question several times until she responded or her saying something to which the other person responded, and unless she actively attempted to control a conversation's direction she relied on the other person to achieve and maintain its flow.{{sfn|Curtiss|1989|pp=33, 40–41, 118–119}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1979/&gt; She typically did not acknowledge statements, requests, or other common pieces of conversation, and when she did respond it was often with a significant delay. Curtiss wrote that Genie grew progressively better at both, although even by mid-1975 she did not always respond or took an unusually long time to do so.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=27, 33–36}} If she did respond she often repeated something said earlier, and she used repetitive statements to serve several conversational functions.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=34, 40–41, 233}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1989|pp=118–119}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1979/&gt;

In everyday interactions Genie became steadily more willing and able to speak during her stay with the Riglers, often spontaneously contributing to an ongoing discussion and sometimes doing so even if the conversation did not initially involve her and was not specifically about her.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=33–36}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1989|pp=118–119}} She was generally more willing to start or enter conversations on topics which interested her, although she would sometimes attempt to join in a conversation on other matters.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=34, 233}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1979/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1979b/&gt; When she wanted to talk about a particular subject she would sometimes allow the topic to change, but often persisted by repeating herself even after someone made multiple efforts to discuss something else. Otherwise she normally went along with a topic somebody else raised, and when attempting to enter an ongoing conversation she would try to say something relevant.&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=34, 233}}&lt;ref name=Morford/&gt; If she could not say something semantically related to a topic, she sometimes tried to join in using other means; Curtiss recalled one dinner conversation at the Riglers' home in 1972 in which several people used the word "tenant", and in an effort to contribute Genie said the word "ten" and held up ten fingers.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=33–34, 233}}

As Genie learned more language she gradually included more grammatical complexity in her speech during everyday interactions, and began to apply her language to more everyday situations.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt; In late 1973 she startled linguists when she gave a monologue consisting of a series of short utterances to a small group of familiar adults, which was much longer than any of her previously recorded speech; while she only used grammar she had fully mastered she seemed to be using different words to try to express herself, which Curtiss thought was a sort of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]], making it the closest she came to attempting any language experimentation. Genie subsequently spoke at this length on a few more occasions, always in the same manner and on similar topics.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=185–186}} She also began to use language to describe fictional events, describing some of [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] in language as early as January 1973 and attempting on at least two occasions in 1974 and 1975 to [[lie]].{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=35–36}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=127–130}}

To supplement Genie's language acquisition, once Genie started to combine words the scientists worked to teach Genie ritual speech for common everyday situations. Soon after beginning to produce two-word utterances Genie learned the phrases "Give me [example]", "Help me [example]", and "I want [example]", and later learned "May I have [example]?".{{efn|Curtiss noted that just using this phrase in and of itself did not guarantee Genie would receive what she asked for.}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=30, 160–162}} Analyses of Genie's utterances beginning with "I want" concluded that Genie treated the phrase as one word, and noted that the [[dependent clause]]s in these utterances could all have been separate utterances and never had markers indicating dependence. Linguists also noted that the phrase "Help me" always preceded a verb, whereas "Give me", "May I have", and "I want" always preceded nouns.{{sfn|Bickerton|1990|pp=30, 116–117}} In addition, since she could only use the word ''may'' as a part of the phrase "May I have" to ask a question and never produced a statement or asked about someone else with it, Curtiss did not consider these utterances true  use of an auxiliary structure.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=161}}

By contrast, Genie never used any [[automatic speech]] or [[interjection]]s during conversations. Despite repeated efforts to teach her she could not start an interaction with automatic speech, and she only responded to ritual questions, such as "How are you?", if someone repeatedly asked her and pushed her into doing so;  she then could say "How are you?" or "I am fine", but it would be very forced. The only exception was when the person speaking to her had some additional affect, after which she usually laughed or tried to get the person to do it again.{{efn|To greet someone, once she began using the word ''like'' she usually said "like [X]" or, after learning to use the pronoun ''I'', "I like [X]".}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=32–33, 232}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1988b|p=99}} In addition, Genie never learned any [[profanity]] nor ever used other substitute swear words.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=232–233}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1989|pp=118–119}} These aspects of speech are typically either bilateral or originate in the right hemisphere, and split-brain and hemispherectomy patients normally learn them without difficulty, but linguists were unsurprised that Genie never used them. Curtiss wrote that Genie's failure to do so was because her childhood gave her no opportunity to observe conversation, where children typically learn them.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=232–233}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=151–153}}

Despite Genie's increased willingness and ability to engage in conversation she continued to speak far less than most people in equivalent phases of language acquisition, and her conversational competence remained very low.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=27, 33–36}} In her dissertation, Curtiss wrote that in many aspects Genie's overall demeanor continued to bear a strong resemblance to that of a person who had not been socialized.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=27, 230–234}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=116–117}} The scientists found Genie's inability to master conversational skills was unsurprising and suggested that the ability to engage in conversation was a separate skill from simply knowing language, consistent with earlier observations of retarded and autistic children. They therefore attributed Genie's difficulty with conversation to her lack of socialization during childhood instead of her language constraints.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=233–234}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1989|pp=118–119}}

====Recalling past events====
During a Children's Hospital visit near Christmas 1971 a boy playing with a toy pistol frightened Genie, and when Curtiss tried to reassure her Genie said an abbreviated version of Curtiss' words, "Little bad boy. Bad gun." About two weeks later Curtiss heard Genie speaking to herself and using an invented gesture for the word "naughty", and when Curtiss asked Genie what she said she repeated, "Little bad boy. Bad gun." out loud for several minutes, marking the first time she spoke about something in the past.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=35–36}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|p=129}} Several months later David and Marilyn overheard her saying, "Father hit big stick. Father is angry." to herself, marking the first time anyone heard her talk about her life before starting to acquire language. She infrequently spoke to others about her early life, but the Riglers said that for the rest of the time she lived with them she constantly repeated "Father hit" to herself.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=124–130}} By the end of her stay, she could also talk about something someone else had told her.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=34–36}}

===Speech===
Some of Genie's pronunciation rules and limitations were characteristic of typical [[General American]] English speakers, and her progress with learning to pronounce individual phonemes followed relatively normal patterns for a first-language learner, but many others were highly atypical.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=52, 62–70, 89}} Her speech typically contained unusually extensive deletions and substitutions, including [[vowel reduction]], [[Neutralization (linguistics)|neutralization]], and consonant modifications, and she typically spoke in an extremely high-pitched and monotonic voice. Curtiss determined that, despite the unpredictability with which Genie applied many of her pronunciation rules, there were several clearly defined patterns in her speech.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=58–90, 203–204}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=100}} Some of Genie's pronunciation rules and phonological limitations were normal for General American English speakers, and she clearly limited the variability of her substitutions.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=62}} Similar to young children, Genie's enunciation remained far better in imitation than in her own utterances.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=150}} The scientists worked very hard to strengthen Genie's voice and improve her articulation, but in her dissertation Curtiss wrote that Genie's speech was still extremely difficult to represent using standard [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]].{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=62}}

From the outset scientists could tell that Genie's vowel substitutions were clearly not random, but she did not seem to draw distinctions based on normal classification such as [[Front vowel|front]] versus [[Back vowel|back]] or [[open vowel|open]] versus [[close vowel|close]] vowels.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=82–83, 91}} In her dissertation, Curtiss wrote that Genie still laxed and [[Relative articulation#Centralized vowels|centralized]] the pronunciation of vowels and off-glides.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=39}} When she began using longer words and sentences she often deleted unstressed syllables, for instance pronouncing the word ''refrigerator'' as {{IPA|[frɪ]}}.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=68–72}} As with vowels she would often delete or substitute consonants, although with considerably less variability than with vowels, and for several she had different pronunciation rules based on the position of the phoneme in the word.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=63}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=100}}

There were three consonants, the [[voiced dental fricative]], [[voiced palato-alveolar affricate]], and [[voiceless palato-alveolar affricate]], which Genie did not spontaneously pronounce until 1973 and only inconsistently pronounced after that time.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=63–64}} Until 1973, instead of pronouncing [[alveolar lateral approximant]]s and [[retroflex approximant]]s as separate sounds she articulated both in a manner that Curtiss described as a sound somewhere in between.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=68, 77–80, 86–87}} Genie would also typically, although not always, simplify or delete [[consonant cluster]]s. The one regular exception was that a [[Alveolar and postalveolar approximants|rhotic approximant]] almost always remained intact because Genie seemed to interpret it as a part of the preceding vowel.{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=100}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=63, 65}}

In addition, there were several sounds that Genie did not use as initial or final consonants. In particular, before 1973 Genie frequently, but not always, deleted final consonants without any discernible pattern. Researchers suspected this was the reason Genie did not usually use plural forms, possessive markers, and past tense or third person singular conjugations.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=77–80}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=150}} If someone imitated her deletion of a final consonant she would laugh, reply, "Silly", gesture, and then repeat her utterance with both the final consonant and any other sounds she had initially deleted, causing Curtiss to speculate that Genie simply was not paying attention to how her speech sounded.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=63–64, 67, 72, 86–87}}

In November 1971, Genie displayed an ability to change pitch and volume while [[singing]] that she had never demonstrated in her speech. Around a week after the first time she sang, while on a trip to the hospital, Curtiss improvised a song to calm Genie down and Genie again surprised her by singing along; Curtiss especially noticed that Genie sang the word "hospital" far louder than she had ever spoken. Almost a year after moving in with the Riglers, while David Rigler was examining and cleaning her ear, Genie uttered the only recorded [[screaming|scream]] of her lifetime. The scientists did not know why she had screamed on that particular occasion, or why they never heard her do so again.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|p=115}}

Curtiss and Fromkin wrote that by 1973 Genie seemed to be slowly improving her [[Manner of articulation|articulation]] and that she had clearly strengthened and gained more control over her voice, and by at least the middle of that year she could distinguish and articulate all the sounds of General American.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=100}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=150}} During that year she started to use pitch variation in addition to vowel duration to indicate stress, with the latter remaining the primary method for doing so but becoming much less obtrusive and exaggerated, but she still did not vary pitch or volume to indicate either questions or imperative sentences.{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|pp=99–100}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=89}} While her voice remained largely monotonic she began including  more speech patterns and intonation, sometimes in spontaneous speech but more consistently in imitation. Despite this she still did not use either voiced or [[voiceless dental fricative]]s in spontaneous speech, though she had imitated them since June 1972, and inconsistently used affricates in spontaneous speech.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=52, 63–70, 89}}

In 1973, Genie began optionally articulating consonant clusters consisting of an {{IPA|/s/}} followed by a nasal consonant. For words starting with an {{IPA|/s/}} followed by other types of consonant clusters Genie started to break up the cluster with an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] schwa and soon after, in longer words where she would have previously deleted a vowel, she began to include a schwa where the deleted sound would have been; because [[Stress and vowel reduction in English|reduced vowels]] in English are generally schwas, linguists thought she could have been gaining command of English phonology.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=69–72}} Around the same time, linguists noted that she began to pronounce more final consonants.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=63–64, 67–68, 77–80, 86–87}} By 1975 Genie started to pronounce both voiced and voiceless dental fricatives, albeit rarely, in various word positions, and when she did she frequently [[th-stopping|stopped]] them.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=74–77}}

In 1975 the scientists said that Genie's voice had clearly strengthened and she modified both pitch and volume for emphasis and stress, but she continued to avoid speaking if possible because controlling her voice remained very difficult for her. Her vocalizations were still soft and breathy, and they wrote that, "it is still very difficult to understand her if you have not been with her for a period of time."&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=150}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=187}} In mid-1975 she could speak with a relatively normal declarative sentence stress pattern, and began to do so with increasing frequency. Even then her pronunciation also remained abnormal, as she still frequently deleted and substituted sounds in her speech, and she remained unable to use intonation to indicate a question.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=150}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=39}}

====Haplologies====
When Genie started forming longer sentences, she often produced extreme [[haplology|haplologies]]. She frequently omitted morphological elements which, though necessary to make the utterance grammatical, were clear to present observers, causing speculation that Genie had a grammar rule first mandating and then optionally permitting her to remove grammatical elements which were non-essential in context. At other times Genie condensed and deleted sounds, syllables, or entire words in ways which rendered her speech ambiguous, and for no discernible reason sometimes said the same sentence with and without any omissions.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=29, 180, 194–195}}{{sfn|Bickerton|1990|p=116}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=114–115}} This significantly complicated attempts to determine Genie's true linguistic abilities, and researchers speculated this may have led to her comprehension scores being significantly lower on certain language analysis tests.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=150}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=203–204}} In May 1972, by which time Genie regularly spoke in three or four-word utterances, she attempted to truncate several of her sentences to monosyllables, such as pronouncing the sentence "Monday Curtiss come" as {{IPA|[mʌ̃k]}}. Marilyn and Curtiss told Genie they could not talk to her if she spoke in such a manner, and she then stopped attempting such extreme haplologies but continued to condense sounds when possible.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=29}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=114–115}}

===Nonverbal communication===
Genie gradually began to outwardly exhibit more of her emotions, and for reasons the scientists never managed to discern she maintained her unexplained ability to communicate her desires to complete strangers without words.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=40}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=113, 117–119, 125, 151}} Even while speaking she continued to use supplementary nonverbal gestures to improve her intelligibility. Prior to mid-1974 she invented gestures to indicate specific phonemes and [[homonym]]s regardless of semantic context, unlike previous observations of invented signing systems in which individual gestures exclusively communicated semantic meaning. Sometimes she used one gesture for two similar-sounding but not completely homophonic words, such as her use of the same gesture for both the words "disappear" and "disappointed".{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=34, 61}}

In addition to signing Genie would pantomime some words as she spoke, for instance crouching into a seated position when saying the words "sit" or "sick", and act out sequences of events. Unlike young children, for who this is ancillary to their speech and lessens as they acquire more language, Genie maintained this as an integral part of her vocabulary.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=37–38}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; At first Genie only drew pictures if specifically asked, but later began to draw pictures or use images from magazines or books to relate to daily experiences or if she could not express herself in words.&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=37–38}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=124, 128–130}} Until 1973 Curtiss and Fromkin unsuccessfully tried to teach Genie to read and write, although other people made subsequent attempts; by the time Curtiss presented her dissertation Genie had learned to read approximately five to ten unspecified names and words, and could write individual letters in [[block letters|print]].&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=vi, 39–41}}

To take advantage of Genie's nonverbal abilities, in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to receive sign language instruction; Curtiss described the type of sign language as being, "a system of signing somewhere between [[American Sign Language]] and signed English in its grammatical system."{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=37–38, 51}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=117, 128–130}} Curtiss wrote that Genie would often simultaneously speak and sign, and continued to use and invent her own gestures, but while she continued to use her existing gestures for individual phonemes she started creating new ones to convey a semantic meaning.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=37–38, 51, 61, 168–171}} The scientists did not specifically test Genie's sign language, but Curtiss recorded that by February 1975 Genie could use the sign to indicate a plural and that by the spring of 1975 used the past tense sign. In addition, when told to start a sentence in sign language with the word ''he'' Genie produced "The boy signing is he cookie".{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=38, 61, 168–171}}

==Post-1975==
In June 1975, despite Genie's progress the National Institute of Mental Health cut off their funding for the case study on Genie.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Benzaquén|2006|p=249}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=144–145, 149–150, 155}} Shortly afterwards, in the early summer of 1975, Genie moved out of the Riglers' home to live with her mother. Despite the NIMH grant ending Curtiss continued to regularly meet with her, both administering weekly tests and spending time with her outside of test sessions, and the Riglers maintained contact with Genie and her mother.{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=149–150}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=149–155}} While living with her mother, Genie continued to be largely unresponsive to statements or requests. After a few months, Genie's mother had Genie transferred to the first of what would become a succession of foster homes.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=149–155}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=226–227}}

Soon after moving into this location the people running it began subjecting Genie to extreme physical and psychological abuse, causing her language skills to rapidly regress and making her return to her [[coping mechanism]] of silence.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=153–155}} The incident with the largest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting and told her that if she did it again she would never see her mother, which rapidly accelerated her regression and made her extremely scared of opening her mouth for anything, including speaking, out of fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As she still wanted to communicate with people she knew, she began almost exclusively using the sign language she learned while living with the Riglers.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=226–227}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=153–155}} During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have any regular contact with her, meeting once a week to continue testing, and she wrote that Genie's language skills severely deteriorated due to the abuse she endured. Curtiss later recalled that during this time Genie frenetically signed to her on a variety of topics, but said she could not bring herself to open her mouth so she could speak. At one point, she refused to talk for five months.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1979/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=149–155}}

Upon Genie's removal from this location in April 1977 she required a two-week stay at Children's Hospital, where she was able to see her mother and the Riglers. While she was there her condition somewhat improved, but she continued mostly using sign language to communicate.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=149–155}} That month, Curtiss and Fromkin obtained a year-long grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to continue working with Genie.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=144–145, 149–155}} Authorities then moved to another foster home for several months, an arrangement in which Genie reportedly did fairly well but which unexpectedly ended in late 1977, and after giving her temporary accommodations through the end of December of that year authorities moved her into a different location. In early January 1978 Curtiss wrote a letter in which she stated these moves were all very hard on Genie, causing continued regression in all aspects of her life, and that their frequency heightened their traumatic impact.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=226–227}}

In 1976 Curtiss finished and presented her dissertation, ''Genie: A Psycholinguistic Study of a Modern-Day "Wild Child"'', which analyzed Genie's language until the early summer of 1975. It received reviews from several prominent scientists, and the following year [[Academic Press]] published it.&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=}} Curtiss continued working with Genie through the end of 1977, but after meeting with her on January 3, 1978, Genie's mother suddenly prevented linguists from seeing Genie, entirely ending all testing and evaluations.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeralChildren/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=192–194}} Curtiss published Genie's utterances from mid-1975 to the end of 1977, and analysis of them, in papers she wrote and co-wrote in 1979.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1979/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1979b/&gt; After this, Curtiss continued to analyze Genie's language in later papers.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1982|pp=}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1988a|pp=}}

===Post-1977===
Between early 1978 and mid-1993 Genie moved through several more institutions and foster homes, some of which subjected her to severe levels of abuse and harassment.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=155–157, 208–213}} Shurley saw Genie at least twice during this time, at her 27th birthday party in 1984 and again two years later, and later recalled that during both visits she was almost completely silent and made very little outward expression or eye contact. In 1992 Curtiss said that since 1978 she had only heard two updates on Genie's condition, both indicating she almost never spoke, and in a 1993 book on Genie author [[Russ Rymer]] wrote that as of 1992 she very rarely spoke. In a 1994 afterword to his book Rymer wrote that in early 1993 Genie's mother told him Genie was significantly more verbal, albeit hard to understand.{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=183–189, 208–216, 229–230}} The Riglers reestablished contact with Genie and her mother in mid-1993, and shortly afterwards David Rigler wrote that when he and Marilyn first visited Genie she immediately recognized and greeted both of them by name.&lt;ref name=Rigler1993/&gt;

The latest available information on Genie's speech came in May 2008. That year [[ABC News]] reported that, in 2000, someone speaking to them under condition of anonymity had hired a [[private investigator]] who located Genie. According to the investigator, she only spoke a few words but could still communicate fairly well in sign language.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; In 2002 Curtiss said that she would be interested in measuring Genie's linguistic abilities again, but in July 2016 she said she had not conducted a new evaluation of Genie's language since January 1978.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeralChildren/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carroll |first1=Rory |authorlink=Rory Carroll |title=Starved, tortured, forgotten: Genie, the feral child who left a mark on researchers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/14/genie-feral-child-los-angeles-researchers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727225111/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/14/genie-feral-child-los-angeles-researchers |archivedate=July 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=September 14, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 14, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Genie's is one of the best-known cases of language acquisition in a child with delayed linguistic development.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morford/&gt; Curtiss argued that Genie's case supported Chomsky's hypothesis of innate language, but that Genie demonstrated the necessity of early language stimulation in the left hemisphere of the brain to start.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=154}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt; Because Genie had learned vocabulary and clearly mastered some principles of grammar Curtiss contended that she definitively disproved more extreme conceptualizations of the critical period hypothesis, which predicted that no or almost no language acquisition of any kind could occur after the end of critical period. Instead, she argued that Genie provided evidence for a gradual variation of it; that although some degree of acquisition can occur beyond puberty, permitting some form of ability to communicate using language, it would never progress into normal-sounding speech.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=208–209, 234}}

Furthermore, Curtiss argued that Genie proved only linguistic stimulation could cause the lateralization of language functions, pointing out that Genie's language center had not developed in her left hemisphere despite experiencing enough environmental stimulation to commence lateralization of other brain functions. Without this stimulation, a person would be rendered incapable of processing language from the left hemisphere of the brain and would be forced to only use the right hemisphere.{{sfn|Goldin-Meadow|1982|p=53}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=211–231}}{{sfn|Pinker|2007|pp=296–297}} The contrast between Genie's vocabulary and grammar acquisition also supported the existing hypothesis that these two processes underwent separate development during language acquisition.&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurford&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~jim/crit.per.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516020120/http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~jim/crit.per.pdf | archivedate=May 16, 2013 | deadurl=no | title=The evolution of the critical period for language acquisition | author= Hurford, James R. | authorlink=James Hurford | journal=Cognition |date=September 1991 | volume=40 | issue=3 | pages=159–201 | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(91)90024-X | issn=0010-0277 | oclc=117880336 | accessdate=February 3, 2013 | pmid=1786674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genie's inability to master language despite clear progress in her cognitive development in other areas also suggested that language acquisition and cognition were separate, a new concept at the time.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1994|pp=227–231}}

Genie's inability to engage in normal interactions with other people provided additional evidence that understanding the principles of language was a separate skill from the ability to engage in conversations.{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=232–234}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1989|pp=118–119}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=151–153}} In addition, her rapid progress with nonverbal communication and her exceptional proficiency at it demonstrated that even nonverbal communication was fundamentally separate from language.{{sfn|Reynolds|Fletcher-Janzen|2004|p=428}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1981/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morford/&gt; Her arguments have become widely accepted in the field of linguistics and other linguists and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]], including [[Steven Pinker]] and [[James Hurford]], have cited Genie's case study as evidence for Chomsky's hypothesis of innate language and for a steadily progressing version of the critical period for language acquisition.&lt;ref name=Hurford/&gt;&lt;ref name=FLA&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~karin/550.READINGS/Grimshaw_DeafIsolate.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429041408/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~karin/550.READINGS/Grimshaw_DeafIsolate.pdf |archivedate=April 29, 2015 |deadurl=yes |title=First-language acquisition in adolescence: evidence for a critical period for verbal language development |author1=Grimshaw, Gina M. |author2=Adelstein, Ana |author3=Bryden, M.

Analysis of the aspects of grammar that Genie did and did not acquire aided linguists in determining which structures were more dependent on exposure to language. In particular, the auxiliary component of language had been known to be one of the few children acquire at different rates depending on the amount of speech they heard. Genie's inability to master it supported the idea that its development and that of other similar systems of grammar is more sensitive than vocabulary or more basic grammar, such as word order or recursion, requiring a more conducive language environment to properly develop and having a more specific critical period.&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurford/&gt;{{sfn|Goldin-Meadow|1982|p=53}} Linguists also noted the grammatical skills Genie acquired and used bore striking resemblance to the grammar of [[pidgin]] languages and the gesture systems [[deaf]] children invent when isolated from other deaf people, which contain certain aspects of language, such as vocabulary, recursion, and word order, but always lack other components such as auxiliary structures.&lt;ref name=FLA/&gt;{{sfn|Bickerton|1990|pp=117, 120–123}}{{sfn|Pinker|2007|pp=296–297}}

Genie's language acquisition also refined existing hypotheses and gave rise to additional hypotheses about what parts of language the right hemisphere could acquire after the critical period.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=HumanCapacities/&gt; Throughout the course of her linguistic development her language had remained largely congruous with adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients. By contrast, in both previous and subsequent studies, people with the same conditions who began acquiring language in their right hemispheres prior to the end of the critical period had developed normal vocabulary and grammar.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurford/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=211–234}} This further convinced the scientists that Genie's language acquisition was abnormal because she had started after the critical period, and therefore was processing language in the right hemisphere of her brain.&lt;ref name=Curtiss1978/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|pp=153–155}}

Genie's case has also been used in theorizing about whether the critical period hypothesis can be applied to the acquisition of a [[second language]], a topic which remains the subject of considerable debate.{{sfn|de Groot|2011|pp=50–54}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Second Language Acquisition and the Critical Period Hypothesis | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates | chapter=Critical Periods and (Second) Language Acquisition: Divide et Impera | last1=Eubank | first1=Lynn | last2=Gregg | first2=Kevin R. | year=1999 | location=Mahwah, NJ | pages=65–100 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7OPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74| isbn= 978-0-585-18960-4 | oclc=44960744}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JLVbu6J2dE4C&amp;pg=PA43 | title=Second Language Teaching: A View from the Right Side of the Brain | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers | series=Topics in language and linguistics | last=Danesi | first=Marcel | authorlink=Marcel Danesi | year=2003 | location=Norwell, MA | isbn=978-1-4020-1489-5 | oclc=52518757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earlier cases===
Several people who have analyzed Genie's linguistic development have compared it to historical accounts of children withd delayed language acquisition, including records of language deprivation experiments of [[Psamtik I]], [[King James IV of Scotland]], and Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; Linguists have especially noted the similarities between Genie's case study and the testing of [[Victor of Aveyron]]. The scientists acknowledged the impact these cases had on their research and testing methods, and linguists and historians have cited Genie's case as the impetus for reanalysis of the case study on Victor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Victor of Aveyron: A reappraisal in light of more recent cases of feral speech | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0388000180800039 | author=Lebrun, Yvan | journal=[[Language Sciences]] | date=March 1980 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=32–43 | doi=10.1016/S0388-0001(80)80003-9 | issn=0388-0001 | oclc=425655261}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=40, 37–38, 51, 100–101, 136}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=72–75, 117, 125, 128–130}} Both the research team and outside analyses especially contrasted Genie and a case in the 1950s of a girl known by the name Isabella, who had been isolated from all speech until the age of 6 but within a year of receiving therapy spoke using vocabulary and grammar typical of someone her age.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|de Groot|2011|pp=50–54}} Author [[Justin Leiber]] compared Genie to [[Helen Keller]], particularly noting the differences between the language instruction each received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.feralchildren.com/en/pager.php?df=leiber | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323092817/http://www.feralchildren.com/en/pager.php?df=leiber | archivedate=March 23, 2010 | deadurl=yes | title=Nature's Experiments, Society's Closures | last=Leiber | first=Justin | authorlink=Justin Leiber | journal=Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour | date=June–September 1977 | volume=27 | issue=2–3 | pages=325–343 | doi=10.1111/1468-5914.00041 | issn=0021-8308 | oclc=5152679776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate===

====Scientific value====
Some of the scientists who worked with Genie, including Jay Shurley, concluded based on non-linguistic evidence that she had been mentally retarded from birth and that this rendered it impossible to be completely certain about the utility of studying her language acquisition. During his sleep studies Shurley had uncovered, among a few other persistent abnormalities in her sleep, a highly elevated number of [[sleep spindles]], which are characteristic of people born with severe retardation.&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=53–55}}{{sfn|Newton|2002|pp=214–216, 220}} However, the linguists who studied Genie firmly believed that she possessed at least average intelligence at birth and argued that the abuse and isolation she suffered during her childhood had left her functionally retarded. Curtiss specifically noted that some of Genie's linguistic capabilities, such as her clear ability to distinguish gender in her speech, were very uncharacteristic of someone born mentally retarded.&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|pp=10–13}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=120–121}} Other linguists analyzing Genie's case, including Steven Pinker, have concurred with Curtiss' position.{{sfn|Pinker|2007|pp=296–297}}

The scientists acknowledged that Genie's extreme emotional difficulties may have contributed to delaying her acquisition and willingness to use a few specific pieces of grammar, and at the beginning may have partially explained her very tacit demeanor.{{sfn|Curtiss|Fromkin|Rigler|Rigler|1975|p=153}}{{sfn|Curtiss|Krashen|Fromkin|Rigler|1973|p=99}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|p=121}} Nonetheless, in Curtiss and Fromkin repeatedly maintained that her emotional profile could not have impeded her ability to acquire language; they pointed out that she had clearly progressed in other aspects of her psychological development and was generally happy during their testing, and argued it was extremely implausible that emotional difficulties could interfere with her grammar acquisition without affecting her vocabulary.{{sfn|Benzaquén|2006|p=249}}{{sfn|Rymer|1993|p=121}}{{sfn|Bickerton|1990|p=116}} Several linguists, including Pinker and [[Derek Bickerton]], accepted Curtiss and Fromkin's assessment while a few, including [[Stephen Laurence]], questioned it but considered her case highly valuable.{{sfn|Bickerton|1990|p=116}}{{sfn|Pinker|2007|pp=296–297}}&lt;ref name=Laurence&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/ChomskianAlternative.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027091059/http://www.philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/ChomskianAlternative.pdf | archivedate=October 27, 2011 | deadurl=no | title= A Chomskian Alternative to Convention-Based Semantics | author=Laurence, Stephen | authorlink=Stephen Laurence | pages=269–301 |journal=Oxford Journal |date=April 1996 | volume=105 | issue=418 | doi=10.1093/mind/105.418.269 | issn=1460-2113 | oclc=4890917477 | accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other linguists, including [[Geoffrey Sampson]], argued that the severity of her emotional difficulties made this extremely implausible and therefore negated much of the scientific significance ascribed to her case.{{sfn|Sampson|1997|pp=37–38}}

====Assessment of Genie====
Early accounts of Genie expressed varying degrees of optimism about her language acquisition, and in her dissertation Curtiss argued that, while Genie's speech was still considerably different from that of most people, her, "language performance often does not reflect her underlying linguistic ability".{{sfn|Curtiss|1977|p=203}}&lt;ref name=Fromkin1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1974/&gt; An independent 2006 review of Genie's case concluded that Curtiss' dissertation displayed an unwarranted degree of positivity about Genie's progress and prognosis, pointing out that by the time of its completion Genie's language had clearly regressed from her treatment in foster care.{{sfn|Benzaquén|2006|p=249}} Curtiss' accounts of Genie after her dissertation all acknowledged that Genie's vocabulary had steadily broadened, and argued that she clearly learned some basic grammar, but all had more negative evaluations of Genie's speech. In these writings, Curtiss concluded that she had never learned any meaningful amount of grammar.{{sfn|Curtiss|1988b|p=98}}{{sfn|Curtiss|1982|pp=}}&lt;ref name=Curtiss1979b&gt;{{cite journal | title=How independent is language? On the question of formal parallels between grammar and action | author1=Curtiss, Susan |author2=Fromkin, Victoria A. |author3=Yamada, Jeni Ellen | journal=UCLA Working Papers in Cognitive Linguistics | year=1979 | issue=1 | pages=131–157 | oclc=48750479}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later interviews Curtiss said that Genie could communicate messages using language but did not speak in real sentences, and Russ Rymer wrote that, based on conversations with her and documents she shared with him, she seemed to view the summer of 1972 as the point at which Genie's linguistic abilities plateaued.{{sfn|Rymer|1993|pp=123–125}}&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=nova/&gt;

Outside analysis from Peter Jones, a linguistics professor at [[Sheffield Hallam University]], argued that Curtiss' earlier accounts of Genie's speech, up to and including her dissertation, were more accurate than those from after 1977. He argued that in these later analyses Curtiss did not provide sufficient evidence for many of her later conclusions, saying that she neither examined the utterances she cited in significant detail nor presented them in a manner conducive to doing so, and in a few instances asserted that Curtiss' data outright contradicted her conclusions.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtiss1979/&gt; Jones wrote that, despite the tone of Curtiss' later works and interviews, he found nothing either suggesting reevaluation of her earlier arguments or disavowal of any of her earlier conclusions. In addition, he wrote that Curtiss did not release enough information about Genie's speech from after mid-1975 to determine exactly what, if any, grammatical abilities she had lost, and that the complete lack of data from any time after early January 1978 rendered it impossible to determine the extent to which her language had regressed.&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt;{{sfn|Brown|Jones|2014|pp=11–12}}

Although Jones said that the relatively small number of utterances Genie produced made it impossible to draw definite conclusions, in a 1995 paper he concluded the discrepancies he noted demonstrated that, "the post-(1977) account [of Genie's speech] is not so much based on reanalysis or reinterpretation of the data but on a ''highly selective and misleading misrepresentation of the earlier findings.''"[emphasis as in the original]&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt; This, in turn, left an unresolved tension between Curtiss' pre- and post-1977 analyses of Genie's language which he said meant that until Curtiss published a clarification of her works, "a definitive judgment on the character and extent of Genie's linguistic development still cannot be given."&lt;ref name=Jones1995/&gt; In 2014 Jones maintained these arguments, noting that no additional outside analysis of Genie's utterances and Curtiss' papers had occurred since his paper.{{sfn|Brown|Jones|2014|pp=9–12}} Others discussing Genie's case have cited Jones' arguments, and similarly questioned Curtiss' later analyses of Genie's grammar acquisition. To this point, neither Curtiss nor anyone else directly associated with Genie's case has responded to Jones' arguments.{{sfn|de Groot|2011|pp=51–52}}{{sfn|Benzaquén|2006|pp=340–341}}{{sfn|Sampson|2005|p=42}}

In [[linguistics]], '''locality''' refers to the proximity of elements in a linguistic structure. Constraints on locality limit the span over which rules can apply to a particular structure. Theories of [[transformational grammar]] use syntactic locality constraints to explain restrictions on argument selection, syntactic binding, and [[syntactic movement]].      

==Where locality is observed==
Locality is observed in a number of linguistic contexts, and most notably with:

# Selection of arguments; this is regulated by the [[Projection Principle|projection principle]]
# Binding of two DPs; this is regulated by [[Binding Theory|binding theory]]
# Displacement of wh-phrases; this is regulated by [[wh-movement]]

===Selection===
The projection principle requires that lexical properties — in particular argument structure properties such as [[Theta role|thematic roles]] —  be "projected" onto syntactic structures. Together with Locality of Selection, which forces lexical properties to be projected within a local projection (as defined by [[X-bar theory]]&lt;ref name=SKS /&gt;{{rp|149}}), the projection principle constrains [[Concrete syntax tree|syntactic trees]]. Syntactic trees are represented through constituents of a sentence, which are represented in a hierarchical fashion in order to satisfy locality of selection through the restraints of X-bar theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861536792|title=An introduction to syntactic analysis and theory|last=Dominique.|first=Sportiche,|others=Koopman, Hilda Judith., Stabler, Edward P.|isbn=9781118470480|location=Hoboken|oclc=861536792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

! Locality of Selection
|-
| Every argument that α selects must appear in the local domain of α.
|}
From the perspective of projection, an element can be "stretched" to occupy the following projection levels:

minimal (X)

intermediate (X')

maximal (x max)

These occupying elements appear valid for all syntactically relevant lexical and functional categories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:X-bar Theory locality.svg|thumb|Locality Projection of the Head]]

According to locality of selection, the material introduced in the syntactic tree must have a local relationship with the head that introduces it. This means that each argument must be introduced into the same projection as its head. Therefore, each [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] and [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] will appear within the local projection of the [[Head (linguistics)|head]] that selects it.

For example, the contrast between the well-formed (1a) and the ill-formed (1b) shows that in English, an adverb cannot intervene between a head (the verb ''study'') and its complement (the DP ''the report'').
{|

 (1)  a.  ''John '''carefully''''' [&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; ''studies''] [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; ''the report''].
      b. *''John'' [&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; ''studies''] '''''carefully''''' [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; ''the report''].&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|192}}
|}

In structural accounts of the contrast between (1a) and (1b), the two sentences differ relative to their [[underlying form|underlying structure]]. The starting point is the lexical entry for the verb ''study'', which specifies that the verb introduces two arguments, namely a DP which bears the semantic role of Agent, and another DP which bears the semantic role of Theme.

 lexical entry for ''study'': V, {{underline|&lt;'''DP'''&lt;sub&gt;AGENT&lt;/sub&gt;}},'''DP'''&lt;sub&gt;THEME&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;

In the tree for sentence (1a), the verb is the Head of the VP projection, the DP&lt;sub&gt;THEME&lt;/sub&gt; is projected onto the Complement position (as sister to the head V), and the DP&lt;sub&gt;AGENT&lt;/sub&gt; is projected onto the Specifier (as sister to V'). In this way, (1a) satisfies Locality of Selection as both arguments are projected within the projection of the head that introduces them. In addition, the AdvP ''carefully'' attaches as an unselected adjunct to VP; structurally this means that it is outside of the local projection of V as it is sister to and dominated by VP.  In contrast, in the tree for sentence (1b), the introduction of the AdvP ''carefully'' as sister to the verb ''study'' violates Locality of Selection; this is because the lexical entry of the verb ''study'' does not select an AdvP, so the latter cannot be introduced in the local projection of the verb.

}}Locality can also be broken down into a morphological perspective, by analyzing words with some, or many affixes. A speaker who can make sense of a word with many morphemes (e.g. affixes) must know: how the morpheme is pronounced and what kind of morpheme it is, (free, prefix, suffix). If it is an affix, then the speaker also must know what the affix c-selects. The speaker must also know that the c-selected element must be adjacent to the affix, amounting to the requirement that branches of a tree never cross. Crossing branches is not included in the lexicon, and it is a general property of how linguistic structures are grammatically structured. This is true because lexical entries do no impose a requirement on a part of word structure that it is not sister to. This relates to the fact that affixes cannot c-select for an element which is not a sister. Additionally, the speaker must know what kinds of thing results after c-selection. These key aspects that a speaker must know can be observed in the lexical entries below, with the example "denationalization".

===Binding===
Binding Theory refers to 3 different theoretic principles that regulate DPs&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bare Syntax|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-953424-1|location=Oxford New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Principle A states that anaphors must be bound in their local domain, Principle B states that pronouns must be free in their local domain, and Principle C states that R-expressions cannot be bound. The local domain refers to the smallest XP with a subject. 

Principle A for locality in Binding Theory refers to when binding of an [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphor]] and its antecedent must occur within the local domain. Therefore, the antecedent should be in the same clause that contains the anaphor. A clause is the domain if and only if it is the smallest XP containing a DP that [[c-command]]s the anaphor and has a subject.&lt;ref name="SKS"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Syntactic Analysis|last1=Sportiche|first1=Dominique|last2=Koopman|first2=Hilda|last3=Stabler|first3=Edward|date=2014|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=|isbn=978-1-4051-0017-5|location=West Sussex|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anaphor is considered to be free when it is not c-commanded or coindexed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Locality Principles in Syntax|last=Koster|first=Jan|publisher=Foris Publications|year=1981|isbn=90-70176-06-8|location=USA|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following examples show the application of Binding Theory, Principle A:

{|
|-
| 
 (2) a. ''Mary revealed [DP John]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to [DP himself]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.''
     b. *''Mary revealed [DP himself]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to [DP John]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.''&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|162}}
|}

{{Gallery
|title= 2a&amp;b
|File:Wikitree14a.png
|Mary revealed John to himself.
|File:Wikitree14b.png
|*Mary revealed himself to John.
}}

Example (2a) is predicted to be grammatical by Principle A of binding theory. The anaphor and [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] appear within the same TP domain: TP is the smallest XP that contains the anaphor and DP subject (in this case, the subject is the antecedent). However, in example (2b), the anaphor and antecedent are not bound within the same domain, therefore, the sentence is predicted to be ungrammatical.

{|
|-
|  
 (3) a. ''John heard [DP their]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; criticisms of [DP each other]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.''
     b. *''[DP They]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; heard John's criticisms of [DP each other]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.''&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|167}}
|}

{{Gallery
|title= 3a&amp;b
|File:Wikitree15a.png
|John heard their critisms of each other.
|File:Wikitree15b.png
|*They heard John's criticisms of each other.
}}

Example (3) is similar to example (2). (3a) is grammatical because the anaphor is bound within the same domain as the antecedent. However, example (3b) is ungrammatical because the anaphor and antecedent appear within different domains. The anaphor is not bound.


The following examples show the application of Binding Theory, Principle B:

When the [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; Lucy], is co-indexed with and c-commanded with [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; her], as in (4a), this violates principle B. , meaning they are locally related but are referring to the same entity. Since [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; her] has a c-commanding antecedent in its domain (i.e. [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; Lucy]) this shows that the pronoun is bound in its domain. 

Principle B is obeyed in (4b), because the co-indexation of [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; Lucy] and  [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; her], are free in their domains, meaning that although they are referring to the same entity they are not locally related. 
{| class="wikitable"
|+
|(4) a. *[&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; Lucy]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; admires [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; her]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
b. [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; Lucy]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; thinks that I admire [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; her]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
Principle B does not state anything regarding whether a pronoun requires an antecedent. It is permissible for a pronoun to not have an antecedent in a sentence. Principle B simply states that if a pronoun does have a c-commanding antecedent, then it must be outside of the smallest XP with a subject that has the pronoun, i.e. outside the domain of the pronoun.&lt;ref name="SKS" /&gt;

The following examples show the application of Binding Theory, Principle C:
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!(5) a. *[&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; She]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; said that [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; Lucy]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; took the car 
b) After you spoke to [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt;her]&lt;sub&gt;i,&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt;Lucy]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; took the car

c) The builder of  [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt;her]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; house visited  [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt;Lucy]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
It is important to note that 5a, can be distinguished from 5b and 5c the differences in structural relations between the pronoun and the name. In 5a, she c-commands Lucy, but this does not occur in 5b and 5c. These observations can be described by the preliminary observation that non-pronominals cannot be bound, i.e., non-pronominals cannot be c-commanded by a co-indexed pronoun. Compared to Principle A and Principle B, this requires goes all the way up to the root node, since it is not limited to any domain. &lt;br /&gt;

===Movement===
Movement is the phenomenon that accounts for the possibility of a single syntactic [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] or element occupying multiple, yet distinct locations, depending on the type of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] the element or constituent is in.&lt;ref name=haegeman1999&gt;{{cite book |last1= Haegeman|first1= Liliane|last2= Guéron|first2= Jacqueline|date= 1999|title= English Grammar: A Generative Perspective|location= Malden, Massachusetts|publisher= Blackwell Publishers Inc.|isbn= 0-631-18839-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In wh-movement in English, an [[interrogative sentence]] is formed by moving the [[wh-word]] ([[determiner phrase]], [[preposition phrase]], or [[adverb phrase]]) to the [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier position]] of the [[complementizer phrase]]. This results in the movement of the wh-phrase into the initial position of the clause&lt;ref name="SKS" /&gt; .The +q feature of the complementizer (+q= question feature) results in an [[Extended Projection Principle|EPP]]:XP&lt;sub&gt;+q&lt;/sub&gt; feature: This forces an XP to the specifier position of CP. The +q feature also attracts the bound morpheme in the tense position to move to the head complementizer position; leading to [[do-support]].&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|260–262}}

====Seven sentences====
There are seven types of violations that can occur for wh-movement. These constraints predict the environments in which movement generates an ungrammatical sentence: Movement does not occur locally.

=====Wh-island constraint=====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! The Wh-island Constraint
|-
| If CP has the feature +q, movement of a wh-phrase to a position outside of the clause cannot occur.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|271}} 
|}

This definition tells us that if the specifier position of CP is occupied or if a C is occupied by a +q word, movement of a wh-phrase out of the CP cannot occur.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|271}} In other words, a CP that has a wh-phrase in its [spec, CP] that is filled with another wh-phrase that is not the one that was extracted, but from higher in the tree. The wh-phrase movement is being obstructed by another wh-phrase.&lt;ref name="SKS" /&gt; 

{|
|-
| 
 (4) a. ''[DP Who]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; do you wonder [DP e]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; bought what?''
     b. *''[DP What]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; do you wonder who bought [DP e]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;?''
|}
 
{{Gallery
|title= 4a&amp;b
|File:Syntax Tree English - Who do you wonder bought what.png
|Who do you wonder bought what?
|File:Syntax Tree English - What do you wonder who bought.png
|*What do you wonder who bought?
}}

Example (4b) illustrates the wh-island constraint. The embedded clause contains a complementizer with the feature +q. This causes the DP "who" to move to the specifier position of that complementizer phrase. Movement of the complement DP "what" cannot occur since the specifier position of CP is filled. Therefore, movement of the wh-word, ''what,'' generates an ungrammatical sentence, while movement of the wh-word "who" is allowed (specifier position of the embedded CP is not occupied).

=====Adjunct island condition=====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Adjunct Island Condition
|-
| If an adjunct contains a CP, movement of an element inside the CP to a position outside of the adjunct is not allowed.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|273}} 
|}

{|
|-
| 
 (5) a. ''[PP Where]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did he go [PP e]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; before they finished the food?''
     b. *''[DP What]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did he go home before Mary finished [DP e]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;?''
|}

{{Gallery
|title= 5a&amp;b
|File:Syntax Tree English - Where did he go before Mary finished the food.png
|Where did he go before they finished the food?
|File:Syntax Tree English - What did he go home before Mary finished.png
|*What did he go home before Mary finished?
}}

Example (5b) demonstrates the adjunct island condition. We can see that the wh-word, "what", occurs within the complementizer phrase that appears in the adjunct. Therefore, movement of this DP out of the adjunct will generate an ungrammatical sentence. Example (5a) is grammatical because the trace of the PP "where" is not within the adjunct,therefore, movement is allowed. This demonstrates the prohibition of extraction from inside and adjunct and the condition that no element in a CP inside an adjunct may move out of this adjunct. 

=====Sentential subject constraint=====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! The Sentential Subject Constraint
|-
| Movement of an element that appears within the CP subject cannot occur.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|273}} 
|}

A setenial subject is not the subject of a sentence, rather a subject that is a clause. Therefore, a clause that is a subject is called a sentenial subject. The Sentenial Subject Constraint is violated when an element moves out of a CP that is in the subject position. 

{|
|-
| 
 (6) a. ''[DP Who]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did that Bill threw out the cheese annoy [DP e]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;?''
     b. *''[DP What]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did that Bill threw out [DP e]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; annoy you?''
|}

{{Gallery
|title= 6a&amp;b

|Who did that Bill threw out the cheese annoy?
|File:Syntax Tree English - What did that Bill threw out.png
|*What did that Bill threw out annoy you?
}}

Example (6b) displays the sentential subject condition. The subject of the verb in this sentence is a complementizer clause. The DP "what" that appears within the CP subject moves to the specifier position of the main clause. The sentential subject constraint predicts that this wh-movement will result in an ungrammatical sentence since the trace was within the CP subject. Example (6a) is grammatical because the DP "who" does not have a trace within the CP subject, therefore, allowing movement to occur.

=====Coordinate structure constraint=====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! The Coordinate Structure Constraint
|-
| An element within a [[conjunct]] cannot undergo movement out of the conjunct.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|278}} 
|}

{|
|-
| 
 (7) a. ''[DP What and [rice]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did you eat [DP e]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;?''
     b. *''[DP What]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did you eat [DP e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and [rice]]?''&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|267}} 
|}

{{Gallery
|title= 7a&amp;b
|File:Syntax Tree English - What and rice did you eat.png
|What and rice did you eat?
|File:Syntax Tree English - What did you eat and rice.png
|*What did you eat and rice?
}}

Example (7a) is grammatical since the DP complement is moving as a whole to the specifier position of the [[matrix clause]]; nothing is extracted from the larger DP. Example (7b) is an example of the coordinate structure constraint. The DP "what" originally occurs within the DP conjunct, therefore, this constraint predicts that an ungrammatical sentence will result due to the extraction of an element within the conjunct.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|278}}

=====Complex NP constraint=====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! The Complex Noun Phrase Constraint
|-
| Extraction of an element that is a complement or adjunct of a NP is not allowed.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|274}} 
|}

{|
|-
| 
 (8) a. ''[DP Whose book]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did you buy [DP e]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;?''
     b. *''[D Whose]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did you buy [D e]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; book?''
|}

{{Gallery
|title= 8a&amp;b
|File:Syntax Tree English - Whose book did yoy buy.png
|Whose book did you buy?
|File:Syntax Tree English - Whose did you buy book.png
|*Whose did you buy book?
}}

Example (8a) is a grammatical because the DP complement of the verb moves as a whole to the specifier position of the main clause. Example (8b) displays the complex noun phrase constraint. The NP complement D, "whose", is extracted and moved to the specifier position of the main clause. The complex noun phrase constraint predicts that this wh-movement will result in an ungrammatical sentence since extraction of an element within the complex NP is not allowed.

=====Subject condition=====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! The Subject Condition
|-
| Movement of a DP out of the subject DP of the verb is not allowed.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|277}} 
|}

{|
|-
| 
 (9) a. ''A picture of which students appeared in the newspapers?'' 
     b. *''[DP Which students]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did [DP a picture of [DP e]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;] appear in the newspaper?''&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|277}} 
|}

{{Gallery
|title= 9a&amp;b
|File:A picture of which students appeared in the newspapers?.png
| A picture of which students appeared in the newspapers?
|File:Which students did a picture of appear in the newspapers?.png
| *Which students did a picture of appear in the newspapers?
}}

Example (9a) does not display any wh-movement. Therefore, the sentence is grammatical since nothing is extracted from the subject DP. Example (9b) contains wh-movement of a DP that is within the subject DP. The subject condition tells us that this type of movement is not allowed and the sentence will be ungrammatical.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|277}}

=====Left branch constraint=====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! The Left Branch Constraint
|-
| Extraction of a DP subject within a larger DP cannot occur.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|278}} 
|}

{|
|-
| 
 (10) a. ''You are eating [DP [DP whose] cake].'' 
      b. *''[DP Whose]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are you eating [DP [DP e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;] cake]?''&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|278}} 
|}

{{Gallery
|title= 10a&amp;b
|File:You are eating whose cake..png
| You are eating whose cake.
|File:*Whose are you eating cake?.png
| *Whose are you eating cake?
}}

In example (10a), there is no wh-movement, therefore the left branch constraint does not apply and this sentence is grammatical. In example (10b), the DP "whose" is extracted from the larger DP "whose cake." This extraction under the left branch constraint is not allowed, therefore, the sentence is predicted to be ungrammatical. This sentence can be made grammatical by moving the larger DP as a unit to the specifier position of CP.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|278}}

{|
|-
| 
 (10) c. ''[DP Whose cake]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are you eating [DP e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]?'' &lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|278}} 
|}

In example (10c), the whole subject DP structure undergoes wh-movement, which results in a grammatical sentence. This suggests that [[pied-piping]] can be used to reverse the effects of the violations or extraction constraints.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|278}}

 
{|
|-
| 
 (24) *''[DP What]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; did you wonder who ate e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;?'' &lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|271}}
|}

{{Gallery
|File:What did you wonder who ate?.png
|*What did you wonder who ate?
}}

Example (24) is an example of a [[Wh-island|wh-island violation]]. There are two TP bounding nodes that appear between the DP "what" and its trace. Therefore, according to the subjacency condition, movement will result in an ungrammatical sentence.&lt;ref name=SKS/&gt;{{rp|271}}

'''Mandaic''' is the language of the [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]] religion and community. Classical Mandaic is used by a section of the Mandaean community in liturgical rites. The modern descendent of Classical Mandaic, known as [[Neo-Mandaic]] or Modern Mandaic, is spoken by a small section of the Mandaean community around [[Ahvaz]], [[Khuzestan Province]], [[Iran]]. Speakers of Classical Mandaic are found in Iran, [[Iraq]] (particularly the southern portions of the country) and in [[diaspora]] (particularly in the [[United States]]). It is a variety of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], notable for its use of vowel letters (see [[Mandaic alphabet]]) and the striking amount of [[Persian language|Persian]] influence in its lexicon.

Classical Mandaic is a [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic language]] of the [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic sub-family]], and is closely related to the language of the Aramaic portions of the Babylonian [[Talmud]], as well as the language of the incantation texts and Aramaic [[incantation bowl]]s found throughout Mesopotamia. It is also related to [[Syriac language|Syriac]], another member of the Eastern Aramaic sub-family, which is the liturgical language of many Christian denominations throughout the Middle East.

==Neo-Mandaic==
{{Main|Neo-Mandaic}}
Neo-Mandaic represents the latest stage of the phonological and morphological development of Mandaic, a Northwest Semitic language of the [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic]] sub-family. Along with the other surviving dialects of Aramaic, it is classified as [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]]; these form a constellation of dialects ranging from [[Lake Van]] and [[Lake Urmia]] in the north to [[Damascus]] and [[Ahvaz]] in the south, clustered in small groups. Having developed in isolation from one another, most Neo-Aramaic dialects are mutually unintelligible and should therefore be considered separate languages; however, determining the exact relationship between the various Neo-Aramaic dialects is a difficult task, fraught with many problems, which arise from our incomplete knowledge of these dialects and their relation to the Aramaic dialects of antiquity.

Aramaic became the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Fertile Crescent]] largely during the [[Assyria|Neo-Assyrians]] (ca. 934–609 BCE) and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] (576–330 BCE) after them, who adopted it as an [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary language]] for both [[International relations|international communication]] and internal [[Bureaucracy|administrative]] use. It gradually came to supplant the native languages of the region, but due to its wide geographic distribution and political circumstances, it soon evolved into two major sub-families, the Western sub-families comprising [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic|Palestinian Talmudic]], [[Christian Palestinian Aramaic|Christian Palestinian]], and [[Samaritan Aramaic|Samaritan]] and the Eastern subfamilies comprising [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]] (which was in use until the [[Geonim|Geonic]] period), [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and Mandaic.

Although no direct descendants of [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]] survive today, most of the Neo-Aramaic dialects spoken today belong to the Eastern sub-family; these include Central Neo-Aramaic ([[Turoyo language|Ṭuroyo]] and [[Mlahsô language|Mlaḥsô]]), Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (the largest Neo-Aramaic group, which includes various Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects, and the dialects of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]]), and Neo-Mandaic. The only surviving remnant of the Western subfamily is [[Western Neo-Aramaic]], spoken in the villages of [[Ma`loula|Maʿlūla]], Bakhʿa, and Jubb ʿAdīn to the northeast of [[Damascus]]. Of all of these dialects, Eastern or Western, only Neo-Mandaic can be described with any certainty as the direct descendent of one of the Aramaic dialects attested in Late Antiquity. For this reason, it is potentially of great value in reconstructing the history of this sub-family and the precise genetic relationship of its members to one another.

In terms of its [[grammar]], Neo-Mandaic is the most conservative among the Eastern Neo-Aramaic dialects, preserving the old Semitic "suffix" conjugation (or perfect). The [[phonology]], however, has undergone many innovations, the most notable being the loss of the so-called "guttural" consonants.

Neo-Mandaic survives in three subdialects, which arose in the cities of [[Shushtar]], [[Shah Vali, Masjed Soleyman]], and [[Dezful]] in northern [[Khuzestan Province]], [[Iran]]. The Mandaean communities in these cities fled persecution during the 1880s and settled in the Iranian cities of [[Ahvaz]] and [[Khorramshahr]]. While Khorramshahr boasted the largest Mandaic-speaking population until the 1980s, the Iran-Iraq War caused many to flee into diaspora, leaving [[Ahvaz]] the only remaining Mandaic-speaking community.

'''Mandarin''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Mandarin.ogg|ˈ|m|æ|n|d|ər|ɪ|n}}; {{zh|t={{linktext|官話}}|s={{linktext|官话}}|p=Guānhuà|l=speech of officials}}) is a group of related [[varieties of Chinese]] spoken across most of northern and southwestern [[China]].  The group includes the [[Beijing dialect]], the basis of [[Standard Chinese|Standard Mandarin or Standard Chinese]]. Because Mandarin originated in [[North China]] and most Mandarin dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as the '''Northern dialects''' ({{zh|labels=no|s=北方话|p=běifānghuà}}). Many local Mandarin varieties are not [[mutually intelligible]]. Nevertheless, Mandarin is often placed first in [[lists of languages by number of native speakers]] (with nearly a billion).

Mandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups, spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area, stretching from [[Yunnan]] in the southwest to [[Xinjiang]] in the northwest and [[Heilongjiang]] in the northeast. This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the [[North China Plain]] compared to the more mountainous south, combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas.

Most Mandarin varieties have four [[tone (linguistics)|tones]].  The final stops of [[Middle Chinese]] have disappeared in most of these varieties, but some have merged them as a final [[glottal stop]].  Many Mandarin varieties, including the Beijing dialect, retain [[retroflex]] initial consonants, which have been lost in southern dialect groups.

The [[historical capitals of China|capital]] has been within the Mandarin area for most of the last millennium, making these dialects very influential. Some form of Mandarin has served as a national [[lingua franca]] since the 14th century. In the early 20th century, a standard form based on the Beijing dialect, with elements from other Mandarin dialects, was adopted as the [[national language]]. Standard Chinese is the [[official language]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.cn/english/laws/2005-09/19/content_64906.htm |title=Law of the People's Republic of China on the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese Language (Order of the President No.37) |publisher=Chinese Government|date=31 October 2000|accessdate=28 March 2017 |quote=For purposes of this Law, the standard spoken and written Chinese language means Putonghua (a common speech with pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect) and the standardized Chinese characters.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Taiwan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taiwan.gov.tw/content2.php?p=29&amp;c=48 |title=ROC Vital Information |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China (Taiwan) |date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the four official [[languages of Singapore]].

== Name ==
The English word "mandarin" (from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mandarim'', from [[Malay language|Malay]] ''menteri'', from [[Sanskrit]] ''mantrin'', meaning "minister or counsellor") originally meant an [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|official]] of the [[Ming empire|Ming]] and [[Qing empire|Qing]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;''China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Mathew Ricci''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"mandarin", {{cite book
| title = Shorter Oxford English Dictionary | publisher = Oxford University Press
| edition = 6th | year = 2007 | volume = 1 | isbn = 978-0-19-920687-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|A [[folk etymology]] deriving the name from {{lang|zh-Latn|Mǎn dà rén}} ({{zh|labels=no |s=满大人 |l=[[Manchu people|Manchu]] big man}}) is without foundation.{{sfnp|Razfar|Rumenapp|2013|p=293}}}}
Since their native varieties were often mutually unintelligible, these officials communicated using a [[Koiné language]] based on various northern varieties. When [[Jesuit]] missionaries learned this standard language in the 16th century, they called it "Mandarin", from its Chinese name ''Guānhuà'' ({{lang|zh|官话/官話}}), or "language of the officials".{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|p=537}}

In everyday English, "Mandarin" refers to [[Standard Chinese]], which is often called simply "Chinese". Standard Chinese is based on the [[Beijing dialect|particular Mandarin dialect spoken]] in [[Beijing]], with some lexical and syntactic influence from other Mandarin dialects. It is the official spoken language of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), the ''de facto'' official language of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC, Taiwan), and one of the four official languages of the Republic of [[Singapore]]. It also functions as the language of instruction in Mainland China and in Taiwan. It is one of the six official languages of the [[United Nations]], under the name "Chinese". Chinese speakers refer to the modern standard language as
* ''Pǔtōnghuà'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|普通话/普通話}}, literally "common speech") in Mainland China,
* ''Guóyǔ'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|国语/國語}}, literally "national language") in Taiwan, or
* ''Huáyǔ'' ({{lang|zh|华语/華語}}, literally "[[Huaxia|Hua]] language/Chinese language") in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines,
but not as ''Guānhuà''.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}

Linguists use the term "Mandarin" to refer to the diverse group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China, which Chinese linguists call ''Guānhuà''. The alternative term ''Běifānghuà'' ({{lang|zh|北方话/北方話}}), or "Northern dialects", is used less and less among Chinese linguists. By extension, the term "Old Mandarin" or "Early Mandarin" is used by linguists to refer to the northern dialects recorded in materials from the Yuan dynasty.

Native speakers who are not academic linguists may not recognize that the variants they speak are classified in linguistics as members of "Mandarin" (or so-called "Northern dialects") in a broader sense. Within Chinese social or cultural discourse, there is not a common "Mandarin" identity based on language; rather, there are strong regional identities centred on individual dialects because of the wide geographical distribution and cultural diversity of their speakers. Speakers of forms of Mandarin other than the standard typically refer to the variety they speak by a geographic name—for example [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuan dialect]], Hebei dialect or [[Northeastern Mandarin|Northeastern dialect]], all being regarded as distinct from the standard language.

==History==
The hundreds of modern local [[varieties of Chinese]] developed from regional variants of [[Old Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]]. Traditionally, seven major groups of dialects have been recognized. Aside from Mandarin, the other six are [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], and [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]] in central China, and [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] on the southeast coast.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=181}} The ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987) distinguishes three further groups: [[Jin Chinese|Jin]] (split from Mandarin), [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] in the [[Huizhou region]] of [[Anhui]] and [[Zhejiang]], and [[Pinghua]] in [[Guangxi]] and [[Yunnan]].{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=55–56}}

=== Old Mandarin ===
{{main|Old Mandarin}}
[[File:Mengu Ziyun xia 24b.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A page of the ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', covering the syllables ''tsim'' to ''lim'']]

After the fall of the [[Song dynasty#Northern Song, 959–1126|Northern Song]] (959–1126) and during the reign of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common speech developed based on the dialects of the North China Plain around the capital, a language referred to as Old Mandarin. New genres of vernacular literature were based on this language, including verse, drama and story forms, such as the ''[[Qu (poetry)|qu]]'' and ''[[Chinese Sanqu poetry|sanqu]]'' poetry.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=48–49}}

The rhyming conventions of the new verse were codified in a [[rime dictionary]] called the ''[[Zhongyuan Yinyun]]'' (1324). A radical departure from the [[rime table]] tradition that had evolved over the previous centuries, this dictionary contains a wealth of information on the phonology of Old Mandarin. Further sources are the [['Phags-pa script]] based on the Tibetan alphabet, which was used to write several of the languages of the Mongol empire, including Chinese, and the ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', a rime dictionary based on 'Phags-pa. The rime books differ in some details, but overall show many of the features characteristic of modern Mandarin dialects, such as the reduction and disappearance of final plosives and the reorganization of the Middle Chinese tones.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49–51}}

In Middle Chinese, initial [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[affricate consonant|affricates]] showed a three-way contrast between [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], voiceless aspirated and voiced consonants. There were [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]], with the fourth, or "entering tone", a [[checked tone]] comprising syllables ending in plosives (''-p'', ''-t'' or ''-k''). Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch, and by the late [[Tang dynasty]], each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials. When voicing was lost in all languages except the Wu subfamily, this distinction became phonemic and the system of initials and tones was rearranged differently in each of the major groups.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=34–36, 52–54}}

The ''Zhongyuan Yinyun'' shows the typical Mandarin four-tone system resulting from a split of the "even" tone and loss of the entering tone, with its syllables distributed across the other tones (though their different origin is marked in the dictionary). Similarly, voiced plosives and affricates have become voiceless aspirates in the "even" tone and voiceless non-aspirates in others, another distinctive Mandarin development. However, the language still retained a final ''-m'', which has merged with ''-n'' in modern dialects, and initial voiced fricatives. It also retained the distinction between velars and alveolar sibilants in palatal environments, which later merged in most Mandarin dialects to yield a palatal series (rendered ''j-'', ''q-'' and ''x-'' in [[pinyin]]).{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49–50}}

The flourishing vernacular literature of the period also shows distinctively Mandarin vocabulary and syntax, though some, such as the third-person pronoun ''tā'' (他), can be traced back to the Tang dynasty.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=111–132}}

=== Vernacular literature ===
Until the early 20th century, formal writing and even much poetry and fiction was done in [[Literary Chinese]], which was modeled on the [[Chinese classics|classics]] of the [[Warring States period]] and the [[Han dynasty]]. Over time, the various spoken varieties diverged greatly from Literary Chinese, which was learned and composed as a special language. Preserved from the sound changes that affected the various spoken varieties, its economy of expression was greatly valued. For example, {{lang|zh|翼}} (''yì,'' "wing") is unambiguous in written Chinese, but has over 75 [[homophone]]s in [[Standard Chinese]].

The literary language was less appropriate for recording materials that were meant to be reproduced in oral presentations, materials such as plays and grist for the professional story-teller's mill. From at least the Yuan dynasty, plays that recounted the subversive tales of China's Robin Hoods to the Ming dynasty novels such as ''[[Water Margin]]'', on down to the Qing dynasty novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' and beyond, there developed a literature in [[written vernacular Chinese]] (白话/白話 ''báihuà''). In many cases, this written language reflected Mandarin varieties, and since pronunciation differences were not conveyed in this written form, this tradition had a unifying force across all the Mandarin-speaking regions and beyond.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=10}}

[[Hu Shih]], a pivotal figure of the first half of the twentieth century, wrote an influential and perceptive study of this literary tradition, entitled ''Báihuà Wénxuéshǐ'' ("A History of Vernacular Literature").

=== Koiné of the Late Empire ===
{{main|Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)}}
[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|upright|right|''Zhongguo Guanhua'' (中國官話), or ''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'' ("Middle Kingdom's Common Speech"), used on the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[Étienne Fourmont]] (with [[Arcadio Huang]]) in 1742&lt;ref&gt;Fourmont, Etienne (1742). ''Linguae Sinarum Mandarinicae hieroglyphicae grammatica duplex, latinè, &amp; cum characteribus Sinensium''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{quote frame|The Chinese have different languages in different provinces, to such an extent that they cannot understand each other.... [They] also have another language which is like a universal and common language; this is the official language of the mandarins and of the court; it is among them like Latin among ourselves.... Two of our fathers [Michele Ruggieri and Matteo Ricci] have been learning this mandarin language...|[[Alessandro Valignano]]|Historia del principio y progresso de la Compañía de Jesús en las Indias Orientales (1542–1564){{sfnp|Coblin|2000|p=539}}}}

Until the mid-20th century, most Chinese people living in many parts of [[South China]] spoke only their local variety. As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as ''Guānhuà''. Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}

Officials varied widely in their pronunciation; in 1728, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], unable to understand the accents of officials from [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]], issued a decree requiring the governors of those provinces to provide for the teaching of proper pronunciation. Although the resulting Academies for Correct Pronunciation ({{lang|zh|正音書院}}, ''Zhèngyīn Shūyuàn'') were short-lived, the decree did spawn a number of textbooks that give some insight into the ideal pronunciation. Common features included:
* loss of the Middle Chinese voiced initials except for ''v-''
* merger of ''-m'' finals with ''-n''
* the characteristic Mandarin four-tone system in open syllables, but retaining a final glottal stop in "entering tone" syllables
* retention of the distinction between [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] velars and dental affricates, the source of the spellings "Peking" and "Tientsin" for modern "Beijing" and "Tianjin".{{sfnp|Kaske|2008|pp=48–52}}

As the last two of these features indicate, this language was a [[Koiné language|koiné]] based on dialects spoken in the [[Nanjing]] area, though not identical to any single dialect.{{sfnp|Coblin|2003|p=353}} This form remained prestigious long after the capital moved to [[Beijing]] in 1421, though the speech of the new capital emerged as a rival standard. As late as 1815, [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]] based the [[A Dictionary of the Chinese Language|first English–Chinese dictionary]] on this koiné as the standard of the time, though he conceded that the Beijing dialect was gaining in influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A dictionary of the Chinese language: in three parts, Volume 1|given=Robert|surname=Morrison|year=1815|publisher=P.P. Thoms|page=x|url=https://archive.org/details/p1dictionaryofch01morruoft|oclc=680482801}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 19th century, the Beijing dialect had become dominant and was essential for any business with the imperial court.{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|pp=540–541}}

=== Standard Chinese ===
{{Main|Standard Chinese}}

In the early years of the Republic of China, intellectuals of the [[New Culture Movement]], such as [[Hu Shih]] and [[Chen Duxiu]], successfully campaigned for the replacement of [[Literary Chinese]] as the written standard by [[written vernacular Chinese]], which was based on northern dialects. A parallel priority was the definition of a standard national language ({{zh|t=國語|w=Kuo²-yü³|s=国语|p=Guóyǔ|given=t}}). After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at [[Old National Pronunciation|an artificial pronunciation]], the [[National Languages Committee|National Language Unification Commission]] finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932. The People's Republic, founded in 1949, retained this standard, calling it ''pǔtōnghuà'' ({{zh|s=普通话|t=普通話|l=common speech}}).{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=3–15}}
Some 54% of speakers of Mandarin varieties could understand the standard language in the early 1950s, rising to 91% in 1984.  Nationally, the proportion understanding the standard rose from 41% to 90% over the same period.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|pp=27–28}}

The national language is now used in education, the media and formal occasions in both the PRC and the ROC but not in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. This standard can now be spoken intelligibly by most younger people in [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]] with various regional accents. In [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], because of their colonial and linguistic history, the sole language of education, the media, formal speech and everyday life remains the local [[Cantonese]]. Mandarin is now common and taught in many schools{{sfnp|Zhang|Yang|2004}} but still has yet to gain traction with the local population. In Mandarin-speaking areas such as [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]], the local dialect is the native tongue of most of the population.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} The era of mass education in Standard Chinese has not erased these regional differences, and people may be either [[diglossia|diglossic]] or speak the standard language with a notable accent.

From an official point of view, the PRC and ROC governments maintain their own forms of the standard under different names. Technically, both ''Pǔtōnghuà'' and ''Guóyǔ'' base their [[phonology]] on the Beijing accent, though ''Pǔtōnghuà'' also takes some elements from other sources. Comparison of dictionaries produced in the two areas will show that there are few substantial differences. However, both versions of "school-standard" Chinese are often quite different from the Mandarin varieties that are spoken in accordance with regional habits, and neither is wholly identical to the [[Beijing dialect]]. ''Pǔtōnghuà'' and ''Guóyǔ'' also have some differences from the Beijing dialect in vocabulary, grammar, and [[pragmatics]].

The written forms of Standard Chinese are also essentially equivalent, although [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]] are used in China, Singapore and Malaysia, while people in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan generally use [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]].

== Geographic distribution and dialects ==
{{see also|List of varieties of Chinese}}

[[File:Mandarin subgroups and Jin group.png|thumb|right|upright=1.65|Distribution of the eight subgroups of Mandarin plus [[Jin Chinese]], which many linguists include as part of Mandarin, according to the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987){{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Map A2}}]]

Most Han Chinese living in northern and southwestern China are native speakers of a dialect of Mandarin. The [[North China Plain]] provided few barriers to migration, leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China. In contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese varieties, with great internal diversity, particularly in [[Fujian]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=183–190}}{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=22}}

However, the varieties of Mandarin cover a huge area containing nearly a billion people. As a result, there are pronounced regional variations in [[pronunciation]], [[vocabulary]], and [[grammar]],{{sfnp|Szeto|Ansaldo|Matthews|2018}} and many Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible.{{efn|For example:
* In the early 1950s, only 54% of people in the Mandarin-speaking area could understand Standard Chinese, which was based on the Beijing dialect.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|p=27}}
* "Hence we see that even Mandarin includes within it an unspecified number of languages, very few of which have ever been reduced to writing, that are mutually unintelligible."{{sfnp|Mair|1991|p=18}}
* "the common term assigned by linguists to this group of languages implies a certain homogeneity which is more likely to be related to the sociopolitical context than to linguistic reality, since most of those varieties are not mutually intelligible."{{sfnp|Escure|1997|p=144}}
* "A speaker of only standard Mandarin might take a week or two to comprehend even simple Kunminghua with ease—and then only if willing to learn it."{{sfnp|Blum|2001|p=27}}
* "without prior exposure, speakers of different Mandarin dialects often have considerable difficulty understanding each other’s local vernacular even if they come from the same province, provided that two or more distinct groups of Mandarin are spoken therein. In some cases, mutual intelligibility is not guaranteed even if the Mandarin dialects concerned belong to the same group and are spoken within the same province. As reported by a native speaker of the Zhenjiang dialect (a Jianghuai (Lower Yangtze) Mandarin dialect spoken in the Jiangsu province), it is impossible for her to understand the Nantong dialect (another Jianghuai Mandarin dialect spoken around 140 kilometers away in the same province)."{{sfnp|Szeto|Ansaldo|Matthews|2018|pp=241–242}}}}

Most of northeastern China, except for [[Liaoning]], did not receive significant settlements by Han Chinese until the 18th century,{{sfnp|Richards|2003|pp=138–139}} and as a result the [[Northeastern Mandarin]] dialects spoken there differ little from the [[Beijing dialect]].{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=21}} The [[Manchu people]] of the area now speak these dialects exclusively; their native language is only maintained in northwestern [[Xinjiang]], where [[Xibe language|Xibe]], a modern dialect, is spoken.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=215–216}}

The frontier areas of Northwest China were colonized by speakers of Mandarin dialects at the same time, and the dialects in those areas similarly closely resemble their relatives in the core Mandarin area.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=21}} The Southwest was settled early, but the population fell dramatically for obscure reasons in the 13th century, and did not recover until the 17th century.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=21}} The dialects in this area are now relatively uniform.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}} However, long-established cities even very close to [[Beijing]], such as [[Tianjin]], [[Baoding]], [[Shenyang]], and [[Dalian]], have markedly different dialects.

Unlike their compatriots on the southeast coast, few Mandarin speakers engaged in [[Chinese emigration|overseas emigration]] until the late 20th century, but there are now significant communities of them in cities across the world.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}}

=== Classification ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2011}}
The classification of Chinese dialects evolved during the 20th century, and many points remain unsettled. Early classifications tended to follow provincial boundaries or major geographical features.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=36–41}}
In 1936, [[Wang Li (linguist)|Wang Li]] produced the first classification based on phonetic criteria, principally the evolution of [[Middle Chinese]] voiced initials.
His Mandarin group included dialects of northern and southwestern China, as well as those of [[Hunan]] and northern [[Jiangxi]].{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=41–42}}
[[Li Fang-Kuei]]'s classification of 1937 distinguished the latter two groups as [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]] and [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], while splitting the remaining Mandarin dialects between Northern, Lower Yangtze and Southwestern Mandarin groups.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=49}}
The widely accepted seven-group classification of [[Yuan Jiahua]] in 1960 kept Xiang and Gan separate, with Mandarin divided into Northern, Northwestern, Southwestern and Jiang–Huai (Lower Yangtze) subgroups.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=53–54}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=181, 191}}

Of Yuan's four Mandarin subgroups, the Northwestern dialects are the most diverse, particularly in the province of [[Shanxi]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}}
The linguist [[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]] proposed that the northwestern dialects of Shanxi and neighbouring areas that retain a final glottal stop in the Middle Chinese [[entering tone]] (plosive-final) category should constitute a separate top-level group called [[Jin Chinese|Jin]].{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=61}} He used this classification in the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987).{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}} Many other linguists continue to include these dialects in the Mandarin group, pointing out that the Lower Yangtze dialects also retain the glottal stop.{{sfnp|Ting|1991|p=190}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=55–56, 74–75}}

The southern boundary of the Mandarin area, with the central [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], Gan and Xiang groups, is weakly defined due to centuries of diffusion of northern features. Many border varieties have a mixture of features that make them difficult to classify.
The boundary between Southwestern Mandarin and Xiang is particularly weak,{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=190}} and in many early classifications the two were not separated.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=41–46}}
[[Zhou Zhenhe]] and You Rujie include the [[New Xiang]] dialects within Southwestern Mandarin, treating only the more conservative [[Old Xiang]] dialects as a separate group.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=55}}
The [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] dialects have features of both Mandarin and Wu, and have been assigned to one or other of these groups or treated as separate by various authors.
Li Rong and the ''Language Atlas of China'' treated it as a separate top-level group, but this remains controversial.{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=75–76}}{{sfnp|Yan|2006|pp=222–223}}

The ''Language Atlas of China'' calls the remainder of Mandarin a "supergroup", divided into eight dialect groups distinguished by their treatment of the Middle Chinese entering tone (see [[#Tones|Tones]] below):{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|p=75}}

* [[Northeastern Mandarin]], spoken in [[Manchuria]] except the [[Liaodong Peninsula]].{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Map B1}} This dialect is closely related to Standard Chinese, with little variation in lexicon and very few tonal differences.
* [[Beijing Mandarin (division of Mandarin)|Beijing Mandarin]] in Beijing and environs such as [[Chengde]] and northern [[Hebei]], as well as some areas of recent large-scale immigration, such as northern [[Xinjiang]].{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Maps B2, B5}} The Beijing dialect forms the basis of Standard Chinese. This classification is controversial, as a number of researchers view Beijing and Northeastern Mandarin as a single dialect group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=张世方 |script-title=zh:北京官话语音研究 |date=2010 |publisher=北京语言大学出版社 |isbn=9787561927755 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jilu Mandarin]], spoken in [[Hebei]] ("Ji") and [[Shandong]] ("Lu") provinces except the [[Shandong Peninsula]], including [[Tianjin dialect]].{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Map B2}} Tones and vocabulary are markedly different. In general, there is substantial intelligibility with Beijing Mandarin.
* [[Jiaoliao Mandarin]], spoken in [[Shandong Peninsula|Shandong]] (Jiaodong) and [[Liaodong Peninsula]]s.{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Maps B1, B3}} Very noticeable tonal changes, different in "flavour" from Ji–Lu Mandarin, but with more variance. There is moderate intelligibility with Beijing.
* [[Central Plains Mandarin]], spoken in [[Henan]] province, the central parts of [[Shaanxi]] in the [[Yellow River]] valley, eastern [[Gansu]] and southern [[Xinjiang]].{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Maps B3, B4, B5}} There are significant phonological differences, with partial intelligibility with Beijing. The [[Dungan language]] spoken in [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]] belongs to this group.  Dungan speakers such as the poet [[Iasyr Shivaza]] have reported being understood by speakers of the Beijing dialect, but not vice versa.{{sfnp|Rimsky-Korsakoff Dyer|1977–78|p=351}}
* [[Lanyin Mandarin]], spoken in central and western [[Gansu]] province (with capital [[Lanzhou]]) and [[Ningxia]] autonomous region (with capital [[Yinchuan]]), as well as northern [[Xinjiang]].{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Maps B4, B5}}
* [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]] (or Jiang–Huai), spoken in the parts of [[Jiangsu]] and [[Anhui]] on the north bank of the [[Yangtze]], as well as some areas on the south bank, such as [[Nanjing]] in [[Jiangsu]], [[Jiujiang]] in [[Jiangxi]], etc.{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Map B3}} There are significant phonological and lexical changes to varying degrees, and intelligibility with Beijing is limited. Lower Yangtze Mandarin has been significantly influenced by [[Wu Chinese]].
* [[Southwestern Mandarin]], spoken in the provinces of [[Hubei]], [[Sichuan]], [[Guizhou]], [[Yunnan]], and the Mandarin-speaking areas of [[Hunan]], [[Guangxi]] and southern [[Shaanxi]].{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Maps B4, B6}} There are sharp phonological, lexical, and tonal changes, and intelligibility with Beijing is limited to varying degrees.{{sfnp|Escure|1997|p=144}}{{sfnp|Blum|2001|p=27}}
The ''Atlas'' also includes several unclassified Mandarin dialects spoken in scattered pockets across southeastern China, such as [[Nanping]] in [[Fujian]] and [[Dongfang, Hainan|Dongfang]] on [[Hainan]],{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=67–68}}
Another Mandarin variety of uncertain classification is apparently [[Gyami]], recorded in the 19th century in the Tibetan foothills, who the Chinese apparently did not recognize as Chinese.{{sfnp|Mair|1990|pp=5–6}}

== Phonology ==
{{see also|Standard Chinese phonology}}
{{refimprove section|date=July 2011}}

[[Syllable]]s consist maximally of an initial consonant, a glide, a vowel, a final, and tone. Not every syllable that is possible according to this rule actually exists in Mandarin, as there are rules prohibiting certain phonemes from appearing with others, and in practice there are only a few hundred distinct syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Phonology of Standard Chinese|last=Duanmu|first=San|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780199215799|location=Oxford, New York|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonological features that are generally shared by the Mandarin dialects include:
* the [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of [[velar consonant]]s and [[voiceless alveolar fricative|alveolar sibilants]] when they occur before [[palatal approximant|palatal glides]];
* one syllable contains maximum four phonemes (maximum three vowels and no consonant cluster) 
* the disappearance of final [[stop consonant]]s and /-m/ (although in many Lower Yangtze Mandarin and [[Jin Chinese]] dialects, an echo of the final stops is preserved as a [[glottal stop]]);
* the presence of [[retroflex consonant]]s (although these are absent in many [[Southwestern Mandarin|Southwestern]] and [[Northeastern Mandarin]] dialects);
* the historical [[consonant voicing and devoicing|devoicing]] of stops and sibilants (also common to most non-Mandarin varieties).

=== Initials ===
The maximal inventory of initials of a Mandarin dialect is as follows, with bracketed pinyin spellings given for those present in the standard language:{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=139–141, 192}}

* Most Mandarin-speaking areas distinguish between the retroflex initials {{IPA|/ʈ͡ʂ ʈ͡ʂʰ ʂ/}} from the apical sibilants {{IPA|/ts tsʰ s/}}, though they often have a different distribution than in the standard language.  In most dialects of the southeast and southwest the retroflex initials have merged with the alveolar sibilants, so that ''zhi'' becomes ''zi'', ''chi'' becomes ''ci'', and ''shi'' becomes ''si''.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}}
* The alveolo-palatal sibilants {{IPA|/tɕ tɕʰ ɕ/}} are the result of merger between the historical palatalized velars {{IPA|/kj kʰj xj/}} and palatalized alveolar sibilants {{IPA|/tsj tsʰj sj/}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}} In about 20% of dialects, the alveolar sibilants failed to palatalize, remaining separate from the alveolo-palatal initials. (The unique pronunciation used in [[Peking opera]] falls into this category.) On the other side, in some dialects of eastern [[Shandong]], the velar initials have failed to palatalize.
* Many southwestern Mandarin dialects mix {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/xw/}}, substituting one for the other in some or all cases.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=192}} For example, ''fei'' {{IPA|/fei/}} "to fly" and ''hui'' {{IPA|/xwei/}} "dust" may be merged in these areas.
* In some dialects, initial {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} are not distinguished. In Southwestern Mandarin, these sounds usually merge to {{IPA|/n/}}; in Lower Yangtze Mandarin, they usually merge to {{IPA|/l/}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=192}}
* People in many Mandarin-speaking areas may use different initial sounds where Beijing uses initial ''r-'' {{IPA|/ɻ/}}. Common variants include {{IPA|/j}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}}
* Some dialects have initial {{IPA|/ŋ/}} corresponding to the zero initial of the standard language.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}}  This initial is the result of a merger of the Middle Chinese zero initial with {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and {{IPA|/ʔ/}}.
* Many dialects of Northwestern and Central Plains Mandarin have {{IPA|/pf pfʰ f v/}} where Beijing has {{IPA|/tʂw tʂʰw ʂw ɻw/}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}} Examples include {{IPA|/pfu/}} "pig" for standard ''zhū'' {{linktext|豬}} {{IPA|/tʂu/}}, {{IPA|/fei/}} "water" for standard ''shuǐ'' {{linktext|水}} {{IPA|/ʂwei/}}, {{IPA|/vã/}} "soft" for standard ''ruǎn'' {{linktext|軟}} {{IPA|/ɻwan/}}.

=== Finals ===
Most Mandarin dialects have three medial glides, {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/ɥ/}} (spelled ''i'', ''u'' and ''ü'' in pinyin), though their incidence varies.
The medial {{IPA|/w/}}, is lost after apical initials in several areas.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}}
Thus Southwestern Mandarin has {{IPA|/tei/}} "right" where the standard language has ''dui'' {{IPA|/twei/}}.
Southwestern Mandarin also has {{IPA|/kai kʰai xai/}} in some words where the standard has ''jie qie xie'' {{IPA|/tɕjɛ tɕʰjɛ ɕjɛ/}}. This is a stereotypical feature of southwestern Mandarin, since it is so easily noticeable. E.g. ''hai'' "shoe" for standard ''xie'', ''gai'' "street" for standard ''jie''.

Mandarin dialects typically have relatively few vowels. [[Syllabic fricative]]s, as in standard ''zi'' and ''zhi'', are common in Mandarin dialects, though they also occur elsewhere.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=194}}
The Middle Chinese off-glides {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} are generally preserved in Mandarin dialects, yielding several [[diphthong]]s and [[triphthong]]s in contrast to the larger sets of monophthongs common in other dialect groups (and some widely scattered Mandarin dialects).{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=194}}

The Middle Chinese coda {{IPA|/m/}} was still present in [[Old Mandarin]], but has merged with {{IPA|/n/}} in the modern dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}}
In some areas (especially the southwest) final {{IPA|/ŋ/}} has also merged with {{IPA|/n/}}. This is especially prevalent in the rhyme pairs ''-en/-eng'' {{IPA|/ən əŋ/}} and ''-in/-ing'' {{IPA|/in iŋ/}}. As a result, ''jīn'' "gold" and ''jīng'' "capital" merge in those dialects.

The Middle Chinese final stops have undergone a variety of developments in different Mandarin dialects (see [[#Tones|Tones]] below).
In Lower Yangtze dialects and some north-western dialects they have merged as a final [[glottal stop]].
In other dialects they have been lost, with varying effects on the vowel.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}}
As a result, Beijing Mandarin and Northeastern Mandarin underwent more vowel mergers than many other varieties of Mandarin. For example:

[[R-colored vowel|R-coloring]], a characteristic feature of Mandarin, works quite differently in the southwest. Whereas Beijing dialect generally removes only a final {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/n/}} when adding the rhotic final ''-r'' {{IPA|/ɻ/}}, in the southwest the ''-r'' replaces nearly the entire rhyme.

=== Tones ===
[[File:Mandarin tones in musical notation.svg|thumb|Four tones of [[Standard Chinese|Modern Standard Mandarin Chinese]], using musical notation.]]
In general, no two Mandarin-speaking areas have exactly the same set of [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] values, but most Mandarin-speaking areas have very similar tone ''distribution''.  For example, the dialects of [[Jinan]], [[Chengdu]], [[Xi'an]] and so on all have four tones that correspond quite well to the [[Beijing dialect]] tones of {{IPA|[˥]}} (55), {{IPA|[˧˥]}} (35), {{IPA|[˨˩˦]}} (214), and {{IPA|[˥˩]}} (51). The exception to this rule lies in the distribution of syllables formerly ending in a stop consonant, which are treated differently in different dialects of Mandarin.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=194–196}}

[[Middle Chinese]] stops and affricates had a three-way distinction between tenuis, voiceless aspirate and voiced (or breathy voiced) consonants.
In Mandarin dialects the voicing is generally lost, yielding voiceless aspirates in syllables with a Middle Chinese level tone and non-aspirates in other syllables.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}}
Of the [[four tones]] of Middle Chinese, the level, rising and departing tones have also developed into four modern tones in a uniform way across Mandarin dialects; the Middle Chinese level tone has split into two registers, conditioned on voicing of the Middle Chinese initial, while rising tone syllables with voiced obstruent initials have shifted to the departing tone.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=194–195}}
The following examples from the standard language illustrate the regular development common to Mandarin dialects (recall that pinyin ''d'' denotes a non-aspirate {{IPA|/t/}}, while ''t'' denotes an aspirate {{IPA|/tʰ/}}):

In traditional Chinese phonology, syllables that ended in a stop in Middle Chinese (i.e. /p/, /t/ or /k/) were considered to belong to a special category known as the "[[entering tone]]".
These final stops have disappeared in most Mandarin dialects, with the syllables distributed over the other four modern tones in different ways in the various Mandarin subgroups.

In the Beijing dialect that underlies the standard language, syllables beginning with original voiceless consonants were redistributed across the four tones in a completely random pattern.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=195}} For example, the three characters {{linktext|积}}{{linktext|脊}}{{linktext|迹}}, all ''tsjek'' in Middle Chinese ([[Baxter's transcription for Middle Chinese|William H. Baxter's transcription]]), are now pronounced ''jī'', ''jǐ'' and ''jì'' respectively.  Older dictionaries such as ''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary]]'' mark characters whose pronunciation formerly ended with a stop with a superscript 5; however, this tone number is more commonly used for syllables that always have a neutral tone (see below).

In Lower Yangtze dialects, a minority of Southwestern dialects (e.g. [[Minjiang dialect|Minjiang]]) and Jin Chinese (sometimes considered non-Mandarin), former final stops were not deleted entirely, but were reduced to a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=195}} (This includes the dialect of [[Nanjing]] on which the [[Postal Romanization]] was based; it transcribes the glottal stop as a trailing ''h''.) This development is shared with [[Wu Chinese]] and is thought to represent the pronunciation of [[Old Mandarin]]. In line with traditional Chinese phonology, dialects such as Lower Yangtze and Minjiang are thus said to have five tones instead of four.  However, modern linguistics considers these syllables as having no [[phonemic]] tone at all.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Dialects in and around the Nantong area typically have many more than 4 tones, due to influence from the neighbouring [[Wu Chinese|Wu dialects]].

Mandarin dialects frequently employ neutral tones in the second syllables of words, creating syllables whose tone contour is so short and light that it is difficult or impossible to discriminate. These atonal syllables also occur in non-Mandarin dialects, but in many southern dialects the tones of all syllables are made clear.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=195}}

== Vocabulary ==
There are more polysyllabic words in Mandarin than in all other major varieties of Chinese except [[Shanghainese]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. This is partly because Mandarin has undergone many more sound changes than have southern varieties of Chinese, and has needed to deal with many more [[homophone]]s. New words have been formed by adding [[affix]]es such as ''lao-'' (老), ''-zi'' (子), ''-(e)r'' (儿/兒), and ''-tou'' (头/頭), or by compounding, e.g. by combining two words of similar meaning as in ''cōngmáng'' (匆忙), made from elements meaning "hurried" and "busy".
A distinctive feature of southwestern Mandarin is its frequent use of noun [[reduplication]], which is hardly used in Beijing. In [[Sichuan]], one hears ''bāobāo'' (包包) "handbag" where Beijing uses ''bāo'r'' (包儿).
There are also a small number of words that have been polysyllabic since Old Chinese, such as {{lang|zh-Latn|húdié}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|蝴蝶}}}}) "butterfly".

The singular [[pronoun]]s in Mandarin are {{lang|zh-Latn|wǒ}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|我}}}}) "I", {{lang|zh-Latn|nǐ}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|你}}}} or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|妳}}}}) "you", {{lang|zh-Latn|nín}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|您}}}}) "you (formal)", and {{lang|zh-Latn|tā}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|他}}}}, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|她}}}} or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|它}}}}) "he/she/it", with -{{lang|zh-Latn|men}} ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|们們}}}}) added for the plural. Further, there is a distinction between the plural first-person pronoun {{lang|zh-Latn|zánmen}} ({{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|咱们}}}}/{{lang|zh-hant|咱們}}), which is inclusive of the listener, and {{lang|zh-Latn|wǒmen}} ({{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|我们}}}}/{{lang|zh-hant|我們}}), which may be exclusive of the listener. Dialects of Mandarin agree with each other quite consistently on these pronouns.  While the first and second person singular pronouns are cognate with forms in other varieties of Chinese, the rest of the pronominal system is a Mandarin innovation (e.g., [[Shanghainese]] has ''non'' {{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|侬}}}}/{{lang|zh-hant|儂}} "you" and ''yi'' {{lang|zh|{{linktext|伊}}}} "he/she").{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=182, 195–196}}

Because of contact with Mongolian and Manchurian peoples, Mandarin (especially the Northeastern varieties) has some loanwords from these languages not present in other varieties of Chinese, such as {{lang|zh-Latn|[[hutong|hútòng]]}} ({{lang|zh|胡同}}) "alley". [[List of Chinese dialects|Southern Chinese]] varieties have borrowed from [[Tai languages|Tai]],{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=36–38}} [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Norman | given=Jerry | title=The Austroasiatics in ancient South China: some lexical evidence | journal=Monumenta Serica | volume=32 | pages=274–301 | year=1976 |author2=Mei, Tsu-lin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Austronesian languages]].

There are also many Chinese words came from foreign languages such as {{lang|zh-Latn|gāo'ěrfū}} ({{lang|zh-hans|高尔夫}}) from golf; {{lang|zh-Latn|bǐjīní}} ({{lang|zh|比基尼}}) from bikini; {{lang|zh-Latn|hànbǎo bāo}} ({{lang|zh-hans|汉堡包}}) from hamburger.

In general, the greatest variation occurs in slang, in kinship terms, in names for common crops and domesticated animals, for common verbs and adjectives, and other such everyday terms. The least variation occurs in "formal" vocabulary—terms dealing with science, law, or government.

== Grammar ==
{{see also|Chinese grammar}}

Chinese varieties of all periods have traditionally been considered prime examples of [[analytic language]]s, relying on word order and particles instead of [[inflection]] or [[affix]]es to provide grammatical information such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], or [[Grammatical case|case]].
Although modern varieties, including the Mandarin dialects, use a small number of particles in a similar fashion to suffixes, they are still strongly analytic.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=10}}

The basic word order of [[subject–verb–object]] is common across Chinese dialects, but there are variations in the order of the two objects of [[ditransitive]] sentences.
In northern dialects the indirect object precedes the direct object (as in English), for example in the Standard Chinese sentence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{| style="border: 1px solid darkgray;"
| 我 || 给 || 你 || 一本 || 书 。
|-
| ''wǒ'' || ''gěi'' || ''nǐ'' || ''yìběn'' || ''shū''.
|-
| I || give || you || a (one) || book.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In southern dialects, as well as many southwestern and Lower Yangtze dialects, the objects occur in the reverse order.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=162}}{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=105–106}}

Most varieties of Chinese use post-verbal particles to indicate [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], but the particles used vary.
Most Mandarin dialects use the particle ''-le'' (了) to indicate the [[perfective aspect]] and ''-zhe'' (着/著) for the [[progressive aspect]].
Other Chinese varieties tend to use different particles, e.g. Cantonese ''zo&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' 咗 and ''gan&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' 紧/緊 respectively.
The experiential aspect particle ''-guo'' (过/過) is used more widely, except in Southern Min.{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=90–93}}

The subordinative particle ''de'' (的) is characteristic of Mandarin dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=196}}
Some southern dialects, and a few Lower Yangtze dialects, preserve an older pattern of subordination without a marking particle, while in others a [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] fulfils the role of the Mandarin particle.{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=113–115}}

Especially in conversational Chinese, sentence-final [[particle (grammar)|particles]] alter the inherent meaning of a sentence. Like much vocabulary, particles can vary a great deal with regards to the locale. For example, the particle ''ma'' (嘛), which is used in most northern dialects to denote obviousness or contention, is replaced by ''yo'' (哟) in southern usage.

Some characters in Mandarin can be combined with others to indicate a particular meaning just like prefix and suffix in English. For example, the suffix -er which means the person who is doing the action, e.g. teacher, person who teaches. In Mandarin the character 師 functions the same thing, it is combined with 教, which means teach, to form the word teacher.

'''Mesopotamian Arabic''', or '''Iraqi Arabic''', is a continuum of mutually-intelligible [[varieties of Arabic]] native to the [[Mesopotamia]]n basin of [[Iraq]] as well as spanning into [[Syria]],&lt;ref name='E1'&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.org/show_language.asp?code=acm Arabic, Mesopotamian | Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]],&lt;ref name='E1'/&gt; southeastern [[Turkey]],&lt;ref name='E2'&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ayp Arabic, North Mesopotamian | Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt;  and spoken in [[Iraqi diaspora]] communities.

==History==
[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] was the [[lingua franca]] in Mesopotamia from the early 1st millennium BCE until the late 1st millennium CE, and as may be expected, Iraqi Arabic shows signs of an Aramaic [[Substratum|substrate]].&lt;ref name=CMK&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muller-Kessler|first=Christa|title=Aramaic 'K', Lyk' and Iraqi Arabic 'Aku, Maku: The Mesopotamian Particles of Existence.|journal=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society|The Journal of the American Oriental Society]]|date=July–September 2003|volume=123|issue=3|pages=641–646|doi=10.2307/3217756 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gelet and the [[Judeo-Iraqi Arabic|Judeo-Iraqi]] varieties have retained features of [[Aramaic language|Babylonian Aramaic]].&lt;ref name=CMK/&gt;

Due to [[Iraq]]'s inherent multiculturalism as well as history, Iraqi Arabic in turn bears extensive borrowings in its [[lexicon]] from Aramaic, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the [[Kurdish languages]] and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
===Consonants===
Even in the most formal of conventions, pronunciation depends upon a speaker's background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Holes|2004|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the number and phonetic character of most of the consonants has a broad degree of regularity among Arabic-speaking regions. Note that Arabic is particularly rich in [[uvular consonant|uvular]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]], and [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] ("[[emphatic consonant|emphatic]]") sounds. The emphatic [[coronal consonant|coronal]]s ({{IPA|/sˤ/}}, {{IPA|/tˤ/}}, and {{IPA|/ðˤ/}}) cause [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of emphasis to adjacent non-emphatic coronal consonants.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} The phonemes {{IPA|/p/}} ⟨[[Pe (Persian letter)|پ]]⟩ and {{IPA|/v/}} ⟨[[Ve (Arabic letter)|ڤ]]⟩ (not used by all speakers) are not considered to be part of the phonemic inventory, as they exist only in foreign words and they can be pronounced as {{IPA|/b/}} ⟨[[ب]]⟩ and {{IPA|/f/}} ⟨[[ف]]⟩ respectively depending on the speaker.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Phonetic notes: 

*{{IPAslink|p}} and {{IPAslink|v}} occur mostly in borrowings from Persian, and may be assimilated to {{IPA|/b/}} or {{IPA|/f/}} in some speakers.
*Original {{IPA|/q/}} splits lexically into {{IPA|/q/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} in most dialects, but {{IPA|/ɡ/}} is pronounced in southern Mesopotamian dialects, even in [[Modern Standard Arabic]].
*The gemination of the flap /ɾ/ results in a trill /r/.

==Varieties==
Mesopotamian Arabic has two major varieties. A distinction is recognised between Gelet Mesopotamian Arabic and [[North Mesopotamian Arabic|Qeltu Mesopotamian Arabic]], the names deriving from the form of the word for "I said".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=T. F.|authorlink=Terence Frederick Mitchell|title=Pronouncing Arabic, Volume 2|year=1990|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]]|isbn=0-19-823989-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern (Gelet) group includes a [[Tigris]] dialect cluster, of which the best-known form is [[Baghdad Arabic|Baghdadi Arabic]], and a [[Euphrates]] dialect cluster, known as ''Furati'' (Euphrates Arabic). The Gelet variety is also spoken in the [[Khuzestan Province]] of [[Iran]].&lt;ref name='E1'/&gt;

The northern (Qeltu) group includes the north Tigris dialect cluster, also known as [[North Mesopotamian Arabic]] or ''Maslawi'' ([[Mosul]] Arabic), as well as both [[Judeo-Iraqi Arabic|Jewish]] and Christian sectarian dialects (such as [[Baghdad Jewish Arabic]]).

==Distribution==
[[File:Árabe_mesopotámico.png|thumb|A view of where Iraqi Arabic are spoken]]

Both the Gelet and the Qeltu varieties of Iraqi Arabic are spoken in [[Syria]],&lt;ref name='E1'/&gt;&lt;ref name='E2'/&gt; the former is spoken on the [[Euphrates]] east of [[Aleppo]] and in [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia]], [[Khuzestan Province]],  [[Iran]] and across the border in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name='E2'/&gt;

'''Sidi al-Mukhtar ibn Ahmad al-Kunti'''{{efn|Sidi al-Mukhtar  ibn Ahmad al-Kunti: "Mukhtar" was his given name, "Ahmad" his father's name and "Kunta" the name of his family. He is often called "Shaykh Mukhtar" or "Sidi Mukhtar". "Shaykh" is a title given to religious leaders. "Sidi" means "Saint" or "Blessed".{{sfn|Fage|Tordoff|2002|p=193}}}} (1729-1811) was a leading [[Muslim]] cleric in the [[Western Sudan]] who played an important role in promoting the spread of [[Islam]] among the black people of West Africa in the nineteenth century.

==Origins==

Al-Mukhtar ibn Ahmad al-Kunti was born in 1729 in the Erg Oralla region to the north of [[Mabroûk, Mali]].{{sfn|Hunwick|2004|p=613}} 
His family belonged to the [[Zawāyā]], a group of tribes that had abandoned violence and self-defense in favor of a peaceful life of religious devotions and herding, paying tribute to the warrior groups to avoid molestation.{{sfn|Willis|1979|p=6}}
He was a member of the influential [[Kunta family|Kunta]] clerical tribe, originally Saharan Berbers from southern Morocco (region around [[Akka, Morocco|Akka]]) who had acted as spokesmen for their fellow Berbers in dealings with the [[Beni Ḥassān]] Arabs. Many of the Kunta moved east to the region north of [[Timbuktu]] and became salt merchants.  The Kunta adopted the teachings of [[Muhammad al-Maghili]], a noted cleric around 1500&amp;nbsp;CE who was said to have introduced the [[Qadiriyya]] order of [[Sufi]]s to the region.{{sfn|Fage|Tordoff|2002|p=193}}

Al-Mukhtar's father died when he was ten.
Other members of his family assisted in his education, as did members of the Kel al-Suq and Kel Hurma families.
His main teacher was Shaykh Sidi Ali bin al-Najib of [[Araouane]], a leading Qadiriyya cleric.{{sfn|Hunwick|2004|p=613}} 
For a period he was caretaker of the tomb near [[Oualata]] of Sidi Ahmad al-Kunti (aka al-Bakka'i Bu Dam'a, {{lang-ar|سيدي أحمد الكنتي البكاي بودمعة}}), a Kunta saint who had died in 1515.{{sfn|Hall|2011|p=63}}
Between 1754 and 1757 he studied in [[Morocco]]. He married a distant cousin on his return.{{sfn|Hunwick|2004|p=613}}

==Career==

Al-Mukhtar succeeded Sidi Ali as Shaykh when he died.
He made his base at [[Azawad]], about {{convert|250|mi}} to the northeast of Timbuktu.
From Azawad he mediated in tribal disputes, particularly between the Kunta and the Barabish.{{sfn|Hunwick|2004|p=613}}
Al-Mukhtar al-Kunti had outstanding leadership abilities in addition to his scholarship and spiritual qualities.  Starting in 1757, already recognized as the leader of the Kunta and soon by all the other Qadiri shaykhs, he became increasingly involved in resolving disputes among the [[Tuareg people]] of the region.{{sfn|Fage|Tordoff|2002|p=193}}

Eventually al-Mukhtar came to be the recognized spiritual leader in a large region around the bend of the [[Niger River]].
In this area the [[Iwellemmedan people|Iwellemmedan]] Tuaregs were the dominant warriors and the Kunta dominated trade as well as providing religious leadership.{{sfn|Fage|Tordoff|2002|p=194}} 
He gave spiritual advice to the Ullimiden tribal chief Kawa Ag Amma.
He died at the age of 82 in 1226&amp;nbsp;AH (1811&amp;nbsp;CE) and was succeeded by his son Muhammad and then his grandson Ahmad al-Bakkay.{{sfn|Hunwick|2004|p=613}}

==Influence==

Al-Mukhtar al-Kunti was a prolific author, said to have written three hundred treatises on aspects of Islam and its practices.{{sfn|Fage|Tordoff|2002|p=194}} 
He saw himself as a [[mujaddid]], and thought that he was inspired by the Prophet, who had appeared to him and said "you are the true messenger to renovate my Way."  In his writings he is strongly opposed to such things as charms and amulets, and to the growing numbers of ''mallams'' primarily interested in money.{{sfn|Willis|1989|p=44}}
Al-Mukhtar al-Kunti strongly believed that a shaykh should lead by example, following a pure asceticism informed by Islamic truth.
He corresponded widely with other scholars in the arid and semi-arid lands that extend from [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] in the east to the Atlantic coast.{{sfn|Hunwick|2004|p=613}}

Al-Mukhtar's huge moral influence and support for the Qadiriyya ''[[tariqa]]'' meant that Islam expanded its role in the region beyond that of the private religion of merchants and scholars. The ''tariqa'' members were required to spread the message among the pagans of one God to whom all men were subordinate. Mukhtar al-Kunti trained clerics so they could establish Islamic schools in the pagan countries, and these schools could in turn spread the word further.{{sfn|Fage|Tordoff|2002|p=194}}
In response to a question on the status of the [[Fulbe people]], Sidi al-Mukhtar explicitly refused to acknowledge any difference between blacks and whites.{{sfn|Hall|2011|p=100}}

Al-Mukhtar's pupil Shaykh Sīdyā al-Kabīr was an influential Qadiriyya cleric in [[Mauritania]].{{sfn|Willis|1979|p=9}}
In [[Ségou Empire|Ségou]] his pupil Bakari was assassinated because he was unwilling to compromise with paganism.{{sfn|Willis|1979|p=18}}
Al-Mukhtar taught both Shaykh [[Usman dan Fodio]] and Shaykh [[Amadu Lobbo]] of [[Massina Empire|Masina]].{{sfn|Hunwick|2004|p=613}}
Usman dan Fodio looked up to al-Mukhtar as a teacher, and al-Mukhtar reportedly threw his support behind Shaykh Usman in the campaign in which he founded the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] in 1809, saying "Usman ibn Fudi is one of the accomplished saints; his ''djihad'' is just."{{sfn|Ajayi|1989|p=542}}

{{Old English topics}}
The '''grammar of Old English''' is quite different from that of [[Modern English]], predominantly by being much more [[inflection|inflected]]. As an old Germanic language, [[Old English]] has a [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] system that is similar to that of the hypothetical [[Proto-Germanic]] reconstruction, retaining many of the inflections thought to have been common in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] and also including characteristically Germanic constructions such as the [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]].

Among living languages, Old English morphology most closely resembles that of modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which is among the most conservative of the [[Germanic languages]]; to a lesser extent, the Old English inflectional system is similar to that of modern [[German language|German]].

[[Noun]]s, pronouns, adjectives and determiners were fully [[inflection|inflected]] with five [[grammatical case]]s ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], and [[instrumental case|instrumental]]), two [[grammatical number]]s ([[Singular number|singular]] and [[plural]]) and three [[grammatical gender]]s (masculine, feminine, and neuter). First- and second-person [[personal pronoun]]s also had [[dual (grammatical number)|dual forms]] for referring to groups of two people, in addition to the usual singular and plural forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter S. Baker |url=http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/resources/IOE/inflpron.html |title=Pronouns |work=The Electronic Introduction to Old English |publisher=Oxford: [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911000749/http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/resources/IOE/inflpron.html |archivedate=September 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The instrumental case was somewhat rare and occurred only in the masculine and neuter singular. It was often replaced by the dative. Adjectives, pronouns and (sometimes) participles agreed with their antecedent nouns in case, number and gender. Finite [[verb]]s agreed with their subject in person and number.

Nouns came in numerous [[declension]]s (with many parallels in [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]]). Verbs came in nine main [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]] (seven ''strong'' and two ''weak''), all with numerous subtypes, as well as a few additional smaller conjugations and a handful of irregular verbs. The main difference from other ancient Indo-European languages, such as Latin, is that verbs could be conjugated in only two tenses (vs. the six "tenses," really tense/aspect combinations, of Latin), and they have no synthetic passive voice although it still existed in [[Gothic language|Gothic]].

The grammatical gender of a given noun does not necessarily correspond to its natural gender, even for nouns referring to people. For example, ''sēo [[wikt:sunne|sunne]]'' (the [[Sun]]) was feminine, ''se [[wikt:mona#Old English|mōna]]'' (the [[Moon]]) was masculine, and ''þæt [[wikt:wif#Old English|ƿīf]]'' "the woman/wife" was neuter. (Compare [[German language|modern German]] ''die Sonne'', ''der Mond'', ''das Weib''.) Pronominal usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender, when it conflicted.

==Morphology==

===Verbs===
Verbs in Old English are divided into [[strong inflection|strong]] and [[weak inflection|weak]] verbs. Strong verbs indicate tense by a change in the quality of a [[vowel]], while weak verbs indicate tense by the addition of an ending.

====Strong verbs====
{{further|Germanic strong verb}}

Strong verbs use the Germanic form of [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] known as [[Indo-European ablaut|''ablaut'']]. In this form of conjugation, the stem of the word changes to indicate the tense. Verbs like this persist in modern English; for example ''sing, sang, sung'' is a strong verb, as are ''swim, swam, swum'' and ''choose, chose, chosen''. The root portion of the word changes rather than its ending. In Old English, there were seven major classes of strong verb; each class has its own pattern of stem changes. Learning these is often a challenge for students of the language, though English speakers may see connections between the old verb classes and their modern forms.

The classes had the following distinguishing features to their infinitive stems:
&lt;ol type="I"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ī + one consonant.
&lt;li&gt;ēo or ū + one consonant.
&lt;li&gt;Originally e + two consonants. By the time of written Old English, many had changed. If C is used to represent any consonant, verbs in this class usually had short e + lC; short eo + rC; short i + nC/mC; or (g̣ +) short ie + lC.
&lt;li&gt;e + one consonant (usually l or r, plus the verb ''brecan'' 'to break').
&lt;li&gt;e + one consonant (usually a stop or a fricative).
&lt;li&gt;a + one consonant.
&lt;li&gt;Other than the above. Always a heavy root syllable (either a long vowel or short + two consonants), almost always a non-umlauted vowel – e.g., ō, ā, ēa, a (+ nC), ea (+ lC/rC), occ. ǣ (the latter with past in ē instead of normal ēo). Infinitive is distinguishable from class 1 weak verbs by non-umlauted root vowel; from class 2 weak verbs by lack of suffix ''-ian''. First and second preterite have identical stems, usually in ēo (occ. ē), and the infinitive and the past participle also have the same stem.
&lt;/ol&gt;

The first [[preterite]] stem is used in the preterite, for the [[grammatical person|first-]] and third-person [[Grammatical number|singular]]. The second preterite stem is used for second-person singular, and all persons in the [[plural]] (as well as the preterite [[Old English subjunctive|subjunctive]]). Strong verbs also exhibit [[I-mutation#I-mutation in Old English|i-mutation]] of the stem in the second- and third-person singular in the [[present tense]].

The third class went through so many sound changes that it was barely recognisable as a single class. The first was a process called [[Old English phonology#Breaking and retraction|'breaking']]. Before {{angbr|h}}, and {{angbr|r}} + another consonant, {{angbr|æ}} turned into {{angbr|ea}}, and {{angbr|e}} to {{angbr|eo}}. Also, before {{angbr|l}} + another consonant, the same happened to {{angbr|æ}}, but {{angbr|e}} remained unchanged (except before combination {{angbr|lh}}).

The second sound change to affect it was the influence of palatal sounds {{angbr|g}}, {{angbr|c}}, and {{angbr|sc}}. These turned preceding {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|æ}} to {{angbr|ie}} and {{angbr|ea}}, respectively.

The third sound change turned {{angbr|e}} to {{angbr|i}}, {{angbr|æ}} to {{angbr|a}}, and {{angbr|o}} to {{angbr|u}} before nasals.

Altogether, this split the third class into five sub-classes:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e + two consonants (apart from clusters beginning with l).
&lt;li&gt;eo + r or h + another consonant.
&lt;li&gt;e + l + another consonant.
&lt;li&gt;g, c, or sc + ie + two consonants.
&lt;li&gt;i + nasal + another consonant.
&lt;/ol&gt;

Regular strong verbs were all conjugated roughly the same, with the main differences being in the stem vowel. Thus ''stelan'' "to steal" represents the strong verb conjugation paradigm.

====Weak verbs====
{{further|Germanic weak verb}}

Weak verbs are formed by adding alveolar (''t'' or ''d'') endings to the stem for the past and past-participle tenses. Examples include ''love, loved'' and ''look, looked''.

Originally, the weak ending was used to form the preterite of informal, noun-derived verbs such as often emerge in conversation and which have no established system of stem-change. By nature, these verbs were almost always transitive, and even today, most weak verbs are transitive verbs formed in the same way. However, as English came into contact with non-Germanic languages, it invariably borrowed useful verbs which lacked established stem-change patterns. Rather than inventing and standardizing new classes or learning foreign conjugations, English speakers simply applied the weak ending to the foreign bases.

The linguistic trends of borrowing foreign verbs and verbalizing nouns have greatly increased the number of weak verbs over the last 1,200 years. Some verbs that were originally strong (for example ''help, holp, holpen'') have become weak by analogy; most foreign verbs are adopted as weak verbs; and when verbs are made from nouns (for example "to scroll" or "to water") the resulting verb is weak. Additionally, conjugation of weak verbs is easier to teach, since there are fewer classes of variation. In combination, these factors have drastically increased the number of weak verbs, so that in modern English weak verbs are the most numerous and productive form, although occasionally a weak verb may turn into a strong verb through the process of analogy, such as ''sneak'' (originally only a noun), where ''snuck'' is an analogical formation rather than a survival from Old English.

There are three major classes of weak verbs in Old English. The first class displays i-mutation in the root, and the second class none. There is also a third class explained below.

Class-one verbs with short roots exhibit [[West Germanic gemination|gemination]] of the final stem consonant in certain forms. With verbs in {{angbr|r}}, this appears as {{angbr|ri}} or {{angbr|rg}}, where {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|g}} are pronounced {{IPA|[j]}}. Geminated {{angbr|f}} appears as {{angbr|bb}}, and that of {{angbr|g}} appears as {{angbr|cg}}. Class-one verbs may receive an [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel before endings beginning in a consonant.

Where class-one verbs have gemination, class-two verbs have {{angbr|i}} or {{angbr|ig}}, which is a separate syllable pronounced {{IPA|[i]}}. All class-two verbs have an epenthetic vowel, which appears as {{angbr|a}} or {{angbr|o}}.

In the following table, three verbs are conjugated. ''Sƿebban'' "to put to sleep" is a class-one verb exhibiting gemination and an epenthetic vowel. ''Hǣlan'' "to heal" is a class-one verb exhibiting neither gemination nor an epenthetic vowel. ''Sīðian'' "to journey" is a class-two verb.

During the Old English period, the third class was significantly reduced; only four verbs belonged to this group: ''habban'' 'have', ''libban'' 'live', ''secgan'' 'say', and ''hycgan'' 'think'. Each of these verbs is distinctly irregular, though they share some commonalities.

====Preterite-present verbs====
The preterite-present verbs are a class of verbs which have a present tense in the form of a strong preterite and a past tense like the past of a weak verb. These verbs derive from the subjunctive or optative use of preterite forms to refer to present or future time. For example, ''ƿitan'', "to know" comes from a verb which originally meant "to have seen" (cf. OE '''ƿise''' "manner, mode, appearance"; Latin '''videre''' "to see" from the same root). The present singular is formed from the original singular preterite stem and the present plural from the original plural preterite stem. As a result of this history, the first-person singular and third-person singular are the same in the present.

Few preterite-present verbs appear in the Old English corpus, and the forms marked with an asterisk are unattested reconstructions, formed by analogy.

In spite of heavy irregularities, there are four groups of similarly-conjugated verbs:

# Āgan, durran, mōtan, and ƿitan
# Cunnan, gemunan (outside the past tense), and unnan
# Dugan, magan, and genugan
# Sculan and þurfan

Note that the Old English meanings of many of the verbs are significantly different from that of the modern descendants; in fact, the verbs "can, may, must", and to a lesser extent "thurf, durr" appear to have [[chain shift]]ed in meaning.

==== Anomalous verbs ====
Additionally, there is a further group of four verbs which are anomalous: "want" (modern "will"), "do", "go" and "be". These four have their own conjugation schemes which differ significantly from all the other classes of verb. This is not especially unusual: "want", "do", "go", and "be" are the most commonly used verbs in the language, and are very important to the meaning of the sentences in which they are used. Idiosyncratic patterns of inflection are much more common with important items of vocabulary than with rarely used ones.

''Dōn'' 'to do' and ''gān'' 'to go' are conjugated alike; ''ƿillan'' 'to want' is similar outside of the present tense.

The present forms of ''ƿesan'' are almost never used. Therefore, ''ƿesan'' is used as the past, imperative, and present participle versions of ''sindon'', and does not have a separate meaning. The ''bēon'' forms are usually used in reference to future actions. Only the present forms of ''bēon'' contrast with the present forms of ''sindon''/''ƿesan'' in that ''bēon'' tends to be used to refer to eternal or permanent truths, while ''sindon''/''ƿesan'' is used more commonly to refer to temporary or subjective facts. This semantic distinction (made only during the present tense) was lost as Old English developed into modern English, so that the modern verb 'to be' is a single verb which takes its present indicative forms from ''sindon'', its past indicative forms from ''ƿesan'', its present subjunctive forms from ''bēon'', its past subjunctive forms from ''ƿesan'', and its imperative and participle forms from ''bēon''. (Modern German had an analogous, but even more complicated, development for its verb ''sein''.) In late OE and ME, the form ''earon''/''earun'', from the [[Old Norse]] ''erun'', replaced bēoþ and sind (See also [[List of English words of Old Norse origin]]).

===Nouns===
Old English is an [[inflection|inflected]] language, and as such its [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[adjective]]s and [[determiner]]s must be [[Declension|declined]] in order to serve a grammatical function. A set of declined forms of the same word pattern is called a declension. As in several other ancient [[Germanic languages]], there are five major [[Grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[dative]], [[genitive]] and [[Instrumental case|instrumental]].
* The '''nominative''' case indicated the subject of the sentence, for example: ''se cyning'' means 'the king'. It was also used for direct address. Adjectives in the predicate (qualifying a noun on the other side of 'to be') were also in the nominative.
* The '''accusative''' case indicated the direct object of the sentence, for example: ''Æþelbald lufode þone cyning'' means "Æþelbald loved the king", where Æþelbald is the subject and the king is the object. Already the accusative had begun to merge with the nominative; it was never distinguished in the plural, or in a neuter noun.
* The '''genitive''' case indicated possession, for example: the ''þæs cyninges scip'' is "the ship of the king" or "the king's ship". It also indicated [[partitive]] nouns.
* The '''dative''' case indicated the indirect object of the sentence; ''To whom'' or ''for whom'' the object was meant. For example: ''hringas þæm cyninge'' means "rings for the king" or "rings to the king". Here, the word ''cyning'' is in its dative form: ''cyninge''. There were also several verbs that took direct objects in the dative.
* The '''instrumental''' case indicated an instrument used to achieve something, for example: ''lifde sƿeorde'', "he lived by the sword", where ''sƿeorde'' is the instrumental form of ''sƿeord''. During the Old English period, the instrumental was falling out of use, having largely merged with the dative. Only pronouns and strong adjectives retained separate forms for the instrumental.

The small body of evidence available for [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] texts suggests that there may also have been a separate [[locative]] case in early or Northumbrian forms of the language (e.g., {{script|Runr|ᚩᚾ ᚱᚩᛞᛁ}} ''on rodi'' "on the Cross").&lt;ref&gt;Page, ''An Introduction to English Runes'', Boydell 1999, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to inflection for case, nouns take different endings depending on whether the noun was in the singular (for example, {{lang|ang|hring}} "one ring"') or plural (for example, {{lang|ang|hringas}} "many rings"). Also, some nouns pluralize by way of [[Germanic umlaut|Umlaut]], and some undergo no pluralizing change in certain cases.

Nouns are also categorized by [[grammatical gender]] – masculine, feminine, or neuter. In general, masculine and neuter words share their endings, while feminine words have their own subset of endings. The plural of some declension types distinguishes between genders, e.g., a-stem masculine nominative plural {{lang|ang|stanas}} "stones" vs. neuter nominative plural {{lang|ang|scipu}} "ships" and {{lang|ang|word}} "words"; or i-stem masculine nominative plural {{lang|ang|sige(as)}} "victories" vs. neuter nominative plural {{lang|ang|sifu}} "sieves" and {{lang|ang|hilt}} "hilts".

Furthermore, Old English nouns are divided as either strong or weak. Weak nouns have their own endings. In general, weak nouns are less complex than strong nouns, since they had begun to lose their system of declension. However, the various noun classes are not totally distinct from one another, and there is a great deal of overlap between them.

Descriptions of Old English language grammars often follow the NOM-ACC-GEN-DAT-INST case order.

====Strong nouns====
Here are the strong declensional endings and examples for each gender:

For the '-u/–' forms above, the '-u' is used with a root consisting of a single short syllable or ending in a long syllable followed by a short syllable, while roots ending in a long syllable or two short syllables are not inflected. (A long syllable contains a long vowel or is followed by two consonants. Note also that there are some exceptions; for example, feminine nouns ending in -þu such as ''strengþu'' 'strength'.)

Note the [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] of the second ''e'' in ''engel'' when an ending follows. This syncope of the vowel in the second syllable occurs with two-syllable strong nouns, which have a long vowel in the first syllable and a second syllable consisting of a short vowel and single consonant (for example, ''engel'', ''ƿuldor'' 'glory', and ''hēafod'' 'head'). However, this syncope is not always present, so forms such as ''engelas'' may be seen.

====Irregular strong nouns====
In addition, masculine and neuter nouns whose main vowel is short ''æ'' and end with a single consonant change the vowel to ''a'' in the plural (a result of the phonological phenomenon known as [[Anglo-Frisian brightening]]):
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Example: ''dæg'' 'day' (masculine)
! Case
! Singular
! Plural
|-
! Nominative
| rowspan="2" | dæg || rowspan="2" | dagas
|-
! Accusative
|-
! Genitive
| dæges || daga
|-
! Dative
| dæge || dagum
|}

Some masculine and neuter nouns end in -e in their base form. These drop the -e and add normal endings. Note that neuter nouns in -e always have -u in the plural, even with a long vowel:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Example of the strong noun declensions ending in -e
! rowspan="2" | Case
! colspan="2" | Masculine&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;ende 'end'&lt;/small&gt;

| endes || enda || stȳles || stȳla
|-
! Dative
| ende || endum || stȳle || stȳlum
|}

Nouns ending in -h lose this when an ending is added, and lengthen the vowel in compensation (this can result in compression of the ending as well):
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Example of the strong noun declensions ending in -h
! rowspan="2" | Case
! colspan="2" | Masculine&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;mearh 'horse'&lt;/small&gt;

|-
! Dative
| mēare || mēarum || fēore || fēorum || scō || scōm
|}

Nouns whose stem ends in -ƿ change this to -u or drop it in the nominative singular. (Note that this '-u/–' distinction depends on [[syllable weight]], as for strong nouns, above.)

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Example of the strong noun declensions ending in -ƿ
! rowspan="2" | Case
! colspan="2" | Neuter&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;smeoru 'grease'&lt;/small&gt;

|-
! Dative
| smeorƿe || smeorƿum || sinƿum || lǣsƿum
|}

A few nouns follow the -u declension, with an entirely different set of endings. The following examples are both masculine, although feminines also exist, with the same endings (for example ''duru'' 'door' and ''hand'' 'hand'). Note that the '-u/–' distinction in the singular depends on syllable weight, as for strong nouns, above.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Example of the -u declension

====Mutating strong nouns====
There are also some nouns of the consonant declension, which show i-umlaut in some forms.

Other such nouns: {{lang|ang|ǣg}}, {{lang|ang|ǣgru}} ''egg'' (ancestor of the archaic or dialectal form ''ey'', plural ''eyren''; the form ''egg'' is a borrowing from Old Norse); ''bread'', ''breadru'' 'crumb'; ''cealf'', ''cealfru'' 'calf'; ''cild'' 'child' has either the normal plural ''cild'' or ''cildru'' (cf. 'children', with -en from the weak nouns); ''hǣmed'', ''hǣmedru'' 'cohabitation'; ''speld'', ''speldru'' 'torch'.

===Adjectives===
Adjectives in Old English are declined using the same categories as nouns: five cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and instrumental), three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), and two numbers (singular, plural). In addition, they can be declined either strong or weak. The weak forms are used in the presence of a definite or possessive determiner, while the strong ones are used in other situations. The weak forms are identical to those for nouns, while the strong forms use a combination of noun and pronoun endings:

{| class="wikitable"

For the '-u/–' forms above, the distinction is the same as for strong nouns.

===Definite articles and demonstratives===
Old English had two main determiners: ''se'', which could function as both 'the' or 'that', and ''þes'' for 'this'.

===Pronouns===
Most pronouns are declined by number, case and gender; in the plural form most pronouns have only one form for all genders. Additionally, Old English pronouns preserve the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual form]] (which is specifically for talking about groups of two things, for example "we two" or "you two" or "they two"). These were uncommon even then, but remained in use throughout the period.

|}

Many of the forms above bear strong resemblances to their contemporary English language equivalents: for instance in the genitive case ''ēoƿer'' became "your", ''ūre'' became "our", ''mīn'' became "mine". Some forms do not match their modern equivalents due to dissimilation. The feminine nominative ''hēo'' was at some point replaced with the feminine nominative article ''sēo'', yielding "she"; whereas the ''h'' in plural forms such as ''hīe'' was replaced with ''þ'' under Norse influence as it evolved (a slower development that was not complete until well into the Middle English period), yielding "they, them, their".

===Prepositions===
Prepositions (like Modern English words ''by'', ''for'', and ''with'') often follow the word which they govern, in which case they are called ''[[postposition]]s''. Also, if the object of a preposition was marked in the dative case, a preposition may conceivably be located anywhere in the sentence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The following is a list of prepositions in the [[Old English language]]. Many of them, particularly those marked "etc.", are found in other variant spellings. [[Prepositions]] may govern the [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]] or [[instrumental case|instrumental]] [[Declension|cases]].

==Syntax==
Old English syntax was similar in many ways to that of Modern English. However, there were some important differences. Some were simply consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection, and word order was generally freer. There are also differences in the default word order and in the construction of negation, questions, relative clauses and subordinate clauses.

*The default [[word order]] was [[verb-second]] and more like [[German language|German]] than Modern English.
*There was no [[do-support|''do''-support]] in questions and negatives.
*Multiple negatives could stack up in a sentence and intensified each other ([[negative concord]]).
*Sentences with subordinate clauses of the type "When X, Y" did not use a ''wh-''type word for the conjunction but used a ''th-''type [[correlative conjunction]] (e.g., ''þā X, þā Y'' instead of "When X, Y").

===Word order===
There was some flexibility in word order of Old English since the heavily inflected nature of nouns, adjectives, and verbs often indicated the relationships between clause arguments. [[Scrambling (syntax)|Scrambling]] of [[constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] was common. Even sometimes scrambling within a constituent occurred, as in ''[[Beowulf|Beoƿulf]]'' line 708 ''ƿrāþum on andan'':
{|
| ''ƿrāþum'' || ''on'' || ''andan''
|-
| style="padding-right: 1em;" | hostile (Dative Singular) || style="padding-right: 1em;" | on/with || malice (Dative Singular)
|-
| colspan="3" | "with hostile malice"
|}
Something similar occurs in line 713 ''in sele þām hēan'' "in the high hall" (lit. "in hall the high").

[[Extraposition]] of constituents out of larger constituents is common even in prose, as in the well-known tale of [[Cynewulf and Cyneheard|Cyneƿulf and Cyneheard]], which begins
:''Hēr Cyneƿulf benam Sigebryht his rīces ond Ƿestseaxna ƿiotan for unryhtum dǣdum, būton Hamtūnscīre; ...''
:(Literally) "Here Cyneƿulf deprived Sigebryht of his kingdom &lt;u&gt;and West Saxons' counselors&lt;/u&gt; for unright deeds, except Hampshire"
:(translated) "Here Cyneƿulf and the West Saxon counselors deprived Sigebryht of his kingdom, other than Hampshire, for unjust actions"
Note how the words ''ond Ƿestseaxna ƿiotan'' "and the West Saxon counselors" (lit. "and (the) counselors of (the) West Saxons") have been ''extraposed'' from (moved out of) the compound subject they belong in, in a way that would be totally impossible in modern English. Case marking helps somewhat: ''ƿiotan'' "counselors" can be nominative or accusative but definitely not genitive, which is the case of ''rīces'' "kingdom" and the case governed by ''benam'' "deprived"; hence, Cyneƿulf can't possibly have deprived Sigebryht of the West Saxon counselors, as the order suggests.

Main clauses in Old English tend to have a [[verb-second]] (V2) order, where the verb is the second constituent in a sentence, regardless of what comes first. There are echoes of this in modern English: "Hardly did he arrive when ...", "Never can it be said that ...", "Over went the boat", "Ever onward marched the weary soldiers ...", "Then came a loud sound from the sky above". In Old English, however, it was much more extensive, like the [[German language#Word order|word order in modern German]]. If the subject appears first, there is an SVO order, but it can also yield orders such as OVS and others. In questions VSO was common, see below.

In [[subordinate clause]]s, however, the word order is completely different, with verb-final constructions the norm, again as in German. Furthermore, in poetry, all the rules were frequently broken. In Beoƿulf, for example, main clauses frequently have verb-initial or verb-final order, and subordinate clauses often have verb-second order. (However, in clauses introduced by ''þā'', which can mean either "when" or "then", and where word order is crucial for telling the difference, the normal word order is nearly always followed.)

Those linguists who work within the [[Chomskyan]] [[transformational grammar]] paradigm often believe that it is more accurate to describe Old English (and other [[Germanic languages]] with the same word-order patterns like modern German) as having underlying subject-object-verb (SOV) ordering. According to this theory, all sentences are initially generated using this order, but in main clauses, the verb is moved back to the V2 position (technically, the verb undergoes ''V-to-T raising''). That is said to explain the fact that Old English allows inversion of subject and verb as a general strategy for forming questions, while modern English uses this strategy almost only with [[auxiliary verb]]s and the main verb "to be", requiring [[do-support|''do''-support]] in other cases.

====Questions====
Because of its similarity with [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]], it is believed that most of the time the word order of Old English changed when asking a question, from SVO to [[verb–subject–object|VSO]]. While many purport that Old English had free word order, this is not quite true, as there were conventions for the positioning of subject, object and verb in clause.
:"I am..." becomes "Am I..."
:''"Ic eom..."'' becomes ''"Eom ic..."

===Relative and subordinate clauses===
Old English did not use forms equivalent to "who, when, where" in relative clauses (as in "The man whom I saw") or subordinate clauses ("When I got home, I went to sleep").

Instead, [[relative clause]]s used one of the following:
#An invariable complementizer ''þe''
#The [[demonstrative pronoun]] ''se, sēo, þat''
#The combination of the two, as in ''se þe''
Preposition-fronting ("The man with whom I spoke") did not normally occur.

Subordinate clauses tended to use [[correlative conjunction]]s, e.g.
:''Þā ic hām ēode, þā slēp ic.''
:(word-for-word) "Then I home went, then slept I."
:(translated) "When I went home, I slept."
The word order usually distinguished the subordinate clause (with verb-final order) from the main clause (with [[verb-second]] word order).

The equivalents of "who, when, where" were used only as [[interrogative pronoun]]s and [[indefinite pronoun]]s, as in [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]].

Besides ''þā ... þā ...'', other [[correlative conjunction]]s occurred, often in pairs of identical words, e.g.:
*''þǣr X, þǣr Y'': "Where X, Y"
*''þanon X, þanon Y'': "Whence (from where/wherefrom) X, Y"
*''þider X, þider Y'': "Whither (to where/whereto) X, Y"
*''þēah (þe) X, þēah Y'': "Although X, Y"
*''þenden X, þenden Y'': "While X, Y"
*''þonne X, þonne Y'': "Whenever X, Y"
*''þæs X, þæs Y'': "As/after/since X, Y"
*''þȳ X, þȳ Y'': "The more X, the more Y"

==Phonology==
{{main|Old English phonology}}
The [[phonology]] of Old English is necessarily somewhat speculative, since it is preserved purely as a [[written language]]. Nevertheless, there is a very large [[text corpus|corpus]] of Old English, and the written language apparently indicates phonological [[alternation (linguistics)|alternations]] quite faithfully, so it is not difficult to draw certain conclusions about the nature of [[Old English phonology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7376">'''OpenVanilla''' (OV) is a free, [[open-source]] text-entry ([[Input method editor|input method]]) and processing [[software architecture|architecture]], and includes a collection of popular input methods and text processing filters. It serves as a bridge between input methods and the operating system. It was originally designed to offer a better text-entry experience and alternative input methods not found in [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s built-in set or suit better the needs for Windows "switchers."&lt;!--not sure what this means--&gt; However, the developers have since worked on a [[Microsoft Windows]] [[porting|port]] and a bridge between OV and [[Smart Common Input Method|SCIM]] on the [[X Window System]]. The [[macOS]] version is compatible with Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger). OV's input methods can also be used through [[Smart Common Input Method|SCIM]] on [[Linux]] or [[FreeBSD]]. An experimental [[Win32]] [[Unicode]] version is also available.

==History and development==
The motivation for OpenVanilla was for to fill an oversight in commercially available software.

Apple was slow to localize its operating system for the Chinese market. In 1987, three years after launching Macintosh, Apple produced a Chinese version of its Finder (then the improper name of its later renamed "Mac OS"), Chinese Talk. There were several competing alternatives, but these never gained traction. However, Apple's Chinese Talk and later its Chinese version of Mac OS had a serious shortcoming: although several Chinese input methods were offered, one of them — the Phonetic "[[Zhuyin]]" method — lacked the Eten [[keyboard layout|Layout]], which more closely emulates Chinese phonetics.

In the mid-1980s, prior to the globalization of computing and software distribution, new computer users learned the Eten Layout as their first (and often only) way of transcribing Chinese characters. Without support for the Eten Layout on the Apple OS, Microsoft maintained a substantial customer base, especially in Taiwan, because the phonetic method in Windows included the Eten Layout as an optional configuration.

Apple's [[macOS|Mac OS X]], launched in 2002, received negative feedback after another popular input method, [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]], was substantially modified, prompting complaints that the method in OS X was [[Backward compatibility|too unfamiliar]], compared to that of [[Mac OS 9|OS 9]].

In 2003, developer [http://use.perl.org/~clkao/ ''clkao'' (Chia-liang Kao)] ported [http://chewing.csie.net/ Chewing], a popular Chinese input method in Linux/FreeBSD world, to OS X. Using Xcode, a development tool included with OS X, it became possible to build customized input methods on OS X. ''clkao'''s port is called [http://chewingosx.sourceforge.net/ ChewingOSX] and was transferred to [http://gugod.org/ ''gugod'' (Kang-ming Liu)] and [http://zonble.twbbs.org/ ''zonble'' (Weizhong Yang)] in 2004 for further maintenance.

The success of these developers inspired another, [http://lukhnos.org/ ''lukhnos''], to create [http://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/Wiki/170/index.html VanillaInput], a phonetic input method that supports the Eten Layout, in July 2004. A month later, [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]] support was also added, overcoming the perceived challenges of OS X.

Prior to these advancements, the focus of large OS producers, such as Apple, did not generally include input method support for minority languages. As a repercussion of the developments surrounding Chewing and VanillaInput, the design of new Chinese input methods was opened for further exploration. Yet, regarding the writing of an IM, many parts (libraries, for example) were still not "open" source.

In October 2004, ''lukhnos'', ''gugod'', ''zonble'' and ''b6s'' began to develop a new IM framework, OpenVanilla, designed on Mac OS X, but intended for implementation beyond OS X. The intention was to create a minimalist and clean design with the goal of helping users write their own IM with minimal C++ knowledge, and independent of the operating platform.

===Holo and POJ input method===
[[Taiwanese Hokkien|Holo]] is an example of a language that can be aided by OpenVanilla. Holo is a language spoken by more than approximately 70% of the Taiwanese population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=TW Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the de facto majority language (even though 95% of the people speak and read Mandarin, the official language, to varying competence and extent), but it lacks the same social standing as Mandarin. One contributing factor to this inequality is that it is not used in information processing, because a proper, fully functioning input method for it was not offered by major OS publishers.

A foundation upon which to build an input method for Holo exists. POJ ([[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]]) is the de facto romanization standard for the [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Holo language]] spoken in Taiwan. In use for over 150 years, POJ was used to publish a Holo Bible and many other important texts. In addition, the transcription of Holo shares similarities with Japanese: the written language can be represented in various ways (in syllabic forms or in ideographic forms). Holo can be written in either Romanized form (Pe̍h-ōe-jī) or in Chinese/Han characters. A standard IME for Japanese exists, in which text is entered phonetically, and then converted by the IME to be presented in various final forms: hiragana, katakana, kanji, or romaji. Conceivably, an analogous system could be developed for Holo using the same principles.

[http://cmt.phys.nthu.edu.tw/~pcchen/POJ/POJDemo2.mov Demo movie]

This screenshot demonstrates the different "layers" of a functional POJ input method. A better Holo input method should evolve further into the "phrase" layer, in which phrases could be automatically interpreted, and users would not be required to explicitly assign tones for each syllable.

==Future==
OpenVanilla is still in its nascent stage. Currently a preliminary implementation is done using rapid prototyping techniques and Objective-C++. To make it platform-independent and more accommodating, it needs to re-implemented. Aside from the Objective-C part that pertains mostly to data structure, OpenVanilla's POJ IM module is a pure algorithm code that deals exclusively with keyboard mapping and syllable transformation without a user interface code, so as not to require an IM developer to possess in-depth knowledge of its inner workings.

The '''"-P Convention"''' or '''"P Question"''' refers to the act of making a statement into a question by appending "P." When spoken aloud, the "P" is literally pronounced as a separate syllable "Pee."

This practice originated among users of the [[Lisp programming language]], in which there is
the convention of appending the letter "P" on elements to denote a [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] (a yes or no question). It is most commonly used at [[MIT]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], or among computer scientists working in [[Artificial intelligence]] (which frequently uses Lisp).

This usage was immortalized in the [[Jargon File]] and from there the use spread to some younger users seeking to be part of the classical [[Internet]] community.

The typical example of use is:
    Q: "Foodp?" (Do you want food?)
    A: "T!" (Literally, True: yes)
    A: "Nil." (Also Null; no, I don't want food).

{{Postmodernism}}
{{Semiotics}}
'''Post-structuralism''', sometimes referred as the '''French theory''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17409292.2014.882655?journalCode=gsit20 "French Theory Revisited"].&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with the works of a series of mid-[[20th-century French philosophy|20th-century French]] [[continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] and [[critical theory|critical theorists]] who came to international prominence in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Bensmaia05"&gt;Bensmaïa, Réda ''Poststructuralism'', article published in [[Lawrence D. Kritzman| Kritzman, Lawrence]] (ed.) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC The Columbia History of Twentieth-Century French Thought]'', Columbia University Press, 2005, pp.92-93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poster88"&gt;[[Mark Poster]] (1988) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-OnWAAAAMAAJ ''Critical theory and poststructuralism: in search of a context''], section ''Introduction: Theory and the problem of Context'', pp.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merquior1987"&gt;Merquior, J.&amp;nbsp;G. (1987). Foucault ([[Fontana Modern Masters]] series), University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-06062-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is defined by its relationship to the system before it—[[structuralism]] (an intellectual movement developed in Europe from the early to mid-20th century). Structuralism proposes that one may understand human [[culture]] by means of a [[structure]]—modeled on language (i.e., [[structural linguistics]])—that differs from concrete [[reality]] and from abstract [[idea]]s—a "third order" that mediates between the two.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze| Deleuze, Gilles]]. 2002. "How Do We Recognise Structuralism?" In ''Desert Islands and Other Texts 1953-1974.'' Trans. David Lapoujade. Ed. Michael Taormina. Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents ser. Los Angeles and New York: Semiotext(e), 2004. 170-192. {{ISBN|1-58435-018-0}}. p.171-173.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Post-structuralist authors all present different critiques of structuralism, but common themes include the rejection of the self-sufficiency of structuralism and an interrogation of the [[binary opposition]]s that constitute its structures.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Edward, ed. 1998. ''Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy.'' Vol. 7 (Nihilism to Quantum mechanics). London and New York: Routledge. {{ISBN| 0-415-18712-5}}. p.597.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers whose works are often characterised as post-structuralist include: [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Judith Butler]],  [[Jean Baudrillard]] and [[Julia Kristeva]], although many theorists who have been called "post-structuralist" have rejected the label.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Paul; 2006; "Post-structuralist Theories"; pp122-135 in Aitken, S. and Valentine, G. (eds); 2006; ''Approaches to Human Geography''; Sage, London&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Existential phenomenology]] is a significant influence; [[Colin Davis (philosopher) |Colin Davis]] has argued that post-structuralists might just as accurately be called "post-[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]]".&lt;ref&gt;
Davis, Colin; "Levinas: An Introduction"; p8; 2006; Continuum, London.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

Post-structuralist philosophers such as Derrida and Foucault did not form a self-conscious group, but each responded to the traditions of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[structuralism]]. The idea that knowledge could be centred on the beholder is rejected by structuralism, which claims to be a more secure foundation for knowledge.&lt;ref name="Colebrook"&gt;Colebrook 2002, pp. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; In phenomenology, this foundation is experiential in itself. In Structuralism, knowledge is founded on the "structures" that make experience possible: concepts, and language or signs. By contrast, Post-structuralism argues that founding knowledge either on pure experience (phenomenology) or systematic structures (Structuralism) is impossible. This impossibility was not meant as a failure or loss, but rather as a cause for "celebration and liberation".&lt;ref name="Colebrook" /&gt;

A major theory associated with structuralism is [[binary opposition]]. This theory proposes that there are frequently used pairs of opposite but related words (concepts), often arranged in a hierarchy. Examples of common binary pairs include: Enlightenment/Romantic, male/female, speech/writing, rational/emotional, signifier/signified, symbolic/imaginary. Post-structuralism rejects the notion of the dominant word in the pair being dependent on its [[:wikt:subservient|subservient]] counterpart. The only way to properly understand the purpose of these pairings is to assess each term individually, and then its relationship to the related term.{{clarify|date=June 2012}}

== Post-structuralism and structuralism ==
[[Structuralism]] was an intellectual movement in France in the 1950s and 1960s that studied the underlying structures in cultural products (such as texts) and used analytical concepts from linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and other fields to interpret those structures. It emphasized the logical and scientific nature of its results.

Post-structuralism offers a way of studying how knowledge is produced and critiques structuralist premises. It argues that because history and culture condition the study of underlying structures, both are subject to biases and misinterpretations. A post-structuralist approach argues that to understand an object (e.g., a text), it is necessary to study both the object itself and the systems of knowledge that produced the object.

=== Historical vs. descriptive view ===
Post-structuralists generally assert that post-structuralism is the historical context surrounding the arts, while structuralism is considered descriptive of the present.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} This terminology is derived from [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s distinction between the views of [[historical linguistics|historical (diachronic)]] and [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive (synchronic)]] reading. From this basic distinction, Post-structuralist studies often emphasize history to analyze descriptive concepts.  By studying how cultural concepts have changed over time, Post-structuralists seek to understand how the same concepts are understood by readers in the present. For example, Michel Foucault's ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'' is both an observation of history and an inspection of cultural attitudes about madness. The theme of history in modern [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] thought can be linked to such influences as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]].

=== Scholars between both movements ===
The uncertain distance between structuralism and post-structuralism is further blurred by the fact that scholars rarely label themselves as Post-structuralists. Some scholars associated with structuralism, such as [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Michel_Foucault|Foucault]], also became noteworthy in Post-structuralism.

===Controversy===
Some observers from outside the post-structuralist camp have questioned the rigor and legitimacy of the field. American philosopher [[John Searle]]&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John. (1990). "[http://www.ditext.com/searle/searle1.html The Storm Over the University]," in The [[New York Times Review of Books]], 6 December 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; argued in 1990 that "The spread of 'poststructuralist' literary theory is perhaps the best known example of a silly but non-catastrophic phenomenon." Similarly, physicist [[Alan Sokal]]&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan. (1997) "[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/le_monde_english.html Professor Latour's Philosophical Mystifications]," originally published in French in ''[[Le Monde]]'', 31 January 1997; translated by the author.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1997 criticized "the postmodernist/poststructuralist gibberish that is now [[hegemonic]] in some sectors of the American academy." Literature scholar Norman Holland argued that Post-structuralism was flawed due to reliance on Saussure's linguistic model, which was seriously challenged by the 1950s and was soon abandoned by linguists: "Saussure's views are not held, so far as I know, by modern linguists, only by literary critics and the occasional philosopher. [Strict adherence to Saussure] has elicited wrong film and literary theory on a grand scale. One can find dozens of books of literary theory bogged down in signifiers and signifieds, but only a handful that refer to [[Chomsky]]."&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Norman N.

{{quote|The deconstructionists ("deconstructionist" and "poststructuralist" mean the same thing, by the way: "poststructuralist" is what you call a deconstructionist who doesn't want to be called a deconstructionist)&amp;nbsp;... see the debate over the ownership of meaning as a skirmish in a larger war in Western philosophy over the idea that presence and unity are ontologically prior to expression. There’s been this longstanding deluded presumption, they think, that if there is an utterance then there must exist a unified, efficacious presence that causes and owns that utterance. The poststructuralists attack what they see as a post-Platonic prejudice in favor of presence over absence and speech over writing. We tend to trust speech over writing because of the immediacy of the speaker: he's right there, and we can grab him by the lapels and look into his face and figure out just exactly what one single thing he means. But the reason why poststructuralists are in the literary theory business at all is that they see writing, not speech, as more faithful to the metaphysics of true expression. For Barthes, Derrida, and Foucault, writing is a better animal than speech because it is iterable; it is iterable because it is abstract; and it is abstract because it is a function not of presence but of absence: the reader’s absent when the writer’s writing, and the writer's absent when the reader's reading. 

For a deconstructionist, then, a writer's circumstances and intentions are indeed a part of the "context" of a text, but context imposes no real cinctures on the text's meaning, because meaning in language requires a cultivation of absence rather than presence, involves not the imposition but the erasure of consciousness. This is so because these guys–Derrida following Heidegger and Barthes Mallarme and Foucault God knows who–see literary language as not a tool but an environment. A writer does not wield language; he is subsumed in it. Language speaks us; writing writes; etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biblioklept.org/2010/12/22/david-foster-wallace-defines-poststructuralism/|title=David Foster Wallace Describes Poststructuralism|last=Biblioklept|date=2010-12-22|website=Biblioklept|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
Post-structuralism emerged in [[France]] during the 1960s as a movement critiquing [[structuralism]]. According to [[José Guilherme Merquior|J.&amp;nbsp;G. Merquior]]&lt;ref name="Merquior1987"/&gt; a [[love–hate relationship]] with structuralism developed among many leading French thinkers in the 1960s.

In a 1966 lecture "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences]]", Jacques Derrida presented a thesis on an apparent rupture in intellectual life. Derrida interpreted this event as a "decentering" of the former intellectual cosmos. Instead of progress or divergence from an identified centre, Derrida described this "event" as a kind of "play."

In 1967, Barthes published [[Death of the author|"The Death of the Author"]] in which he announced a metaphorical event: the "death" of the author as an authentic source of meaning for a given text. Barthes argued that any literary text has multiple meanings, and that the author was not the prime source of the work's semantic content.  The "Death of the Author," Barthes maintained, was the "Birth of the Reader," as the source of the proliferation of meanings of the text.
 
The period was marked by the rebellion of students and workers against the state in May 1968.

== Major works ==

===Barthes and the need for metalanguage===
Barthes in his work, ''Elements of Semiology'' (1967), advanced the concept of the "[[metalanguage]]". A metalanguage is a systematized way of talking about concepts like meaning and grammar beyond the constraints of a traditional (first-order) language; in a metalanguage, symbols replace words and phrases. Insofar as one metalanguage is required for one explanation of first-order language, another may be required, so metalanguages may actually replace first-order languages.  Barthes exposes how this structuralist system is regressive; orders of language rely upon a metalanguage by which it is explained, and therefore [[deconstruction]] itself is in danger of becoming a metalanguage, thus exposing all languages and discourse to scrutiny. Barthes' other works contributed deconstructive theories about texts.

=== Derrida's lecture at Johns Hopkins ===
The occasional designation of Post-structuralism as a movement can be tied to the fact that mounting criticism of Structuralism became evident at approximately the same time that Structuralism became a topic of interest in universities in the United States. This interest led to a colloquium at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1966 titled "The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man", to which such French philosophers as Derrida, Barthes, and Lacan were invited to speak.

Derrida's lecture at that conference, "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences|Structure, Sign, and Play in the Human Sciences]]", was one of the earliest to propose some theoretical limitations to Structuralism, and to attempt to theorize on terms that were clearly no longer structuralist.

The element of "play" in the title of Derrida's essay is often erroneously interpreted in a linguistic sense, based on a general tendency towards puns and humour, while [[social constructionism]] as developed in the later work of Michel Foucault is said to create play in the sense of strategic agency by laying bare the levers of historical change&lt;!--what are the "levers of historical change" specifically?--&gt;. Many see the importance of Foucault's work to be in its synthesis of this social/historical account of the operation of power (see [[governmentality]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

'''Proto-Balto-Slavic''' is a [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[proto-language]] descending from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE). From Proto-Balto-Slavic, the later [[Balto-Slavic languages]] are thought to have developed, composed of sub-branches [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], and including modern [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] among others.

Like most other proto-languages, it is not attested by any surviving texts but has been reconstructed using the [[comparative method]]. There are several [[isogloss]]es that Baltic and Slavic languages share in [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and accentology, which represent common innovations from Proto-Indo-European times and can be chronologically arranged.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirated stops lost their aspiration in Proto-Balto-Slavic. Stops were no longer distinguished between fortis and aspirated but were voiceless and voiced.&lt;ref&gt;Kortlandt (2002:3)&lt;/ref&gt; However,  several new palatal ([[postalveolar]]) consonants had developed: *ś and *ź from earlier palatovelar plosives and *š from *s as a result of the [[Ruki sound law]].

* {{IPA|[z]}} surfaced as an allophone of {{IPA|/s/}} before a voiced consonant in Proto-Balto-Slavic.

===Vowels===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
Proto-Balto-Slavic preserved much of the late Proto-Indo-European vowel system. One noticeable difference between the two was the merging of earlier short {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} into {{IPA|/a/}}. Earlier syllabic sonorants in PIE had been converted into liquid diphthongs by inserting *i or *u before the sonorant in Proto-Balto-Slavic.

===Diphthongs===
Proto-Balto-Slavic preserved most PIE diphthongs intact except for the short /o/ and /a/ merger. The merger of short /o/ and /a/ carried into the production of Proto-Balto-Slavic diphthongs. The diphthongs that contained the onglide /o/ in PIE consequently became diphthongs with the onglide /a/ in Proto-Balto-Slavic. Former /eu/ had become /jau/, so that no /eu/ diphthong existed anymore.

Proto-Balto-Slavic also possessed sequences of a close vowel, followed by *l, *r, *m or *n: the "sonorant diphthongs". Their accents behaved like the other diphthongs rather than like vowel-consonant sequences.

===Accent and the acute register===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
The accent of Balto-Slavic and its descendants is still a topic of active research, and there is still disagreement over the developments in many cases. The following gives only a general overview of the points for which a general consensus has been reached among linguists. Differing opinions are noted when necessary.

Most Proto-Balto-Slavic words could be accented on any syllable, as in Proto-Indo-European. The placement of the accent was changed significantly relative to PIE, with much paradigmatic leveling of the mobile PIE accent, along with leftward and rightward shifts conditioned by the surrounding phonemes.

In the early Balto-Slavic period, an additional articulatory feature, the ''acute register'', had developed on certain syllables, particularly those that ended in a PIE laryngeal consonant (detailed further below). It was a suprasegmental feature whose exact phonetic nature is not quite clear. It likely involved [[glottalization]] at some stage, as a similar articulatory feature is found in the Latvian "broken tone", which is a reflex of it. It is denoted variously with a superscript glottalization symbol ˀ, a glottal stop symbol ʔ, or simply as the laryngeal cover symbol H.

Only the presence or absence of the feature, called "acute" and "circumflex" respectively, was phonemic. Furthermore, the distinction applied only to "long" syllables. The following syllable types were "long" and thus could have this distinction:

* Syllables with long vowels: they could be original PIE long vowels or vowels that were lengthened by a following laryngeal.
* Syllables with vocalic diphthongs (*ei, *ai, *au).
* Syllables with sonorant diphthongs, which consisted of a vowel, followed by *l, *r, *m or *n.

Thus, any syllable was either long with acute register, long with circumflex (nonacute) register or short (with no register distinction).

===Alternations===
Proto-Balto-Slavic retained the system of [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] from its parent language, but it was far less productive and had been significantly reworked. Vowel alternations were often leveled, but it is not always easy to determine how far this leveling had progressed by the time the Balto-Slavic dialects began to diverge, as the leveling progressed along the same lines in all of them to some degree.

The lengthened grade remained productive in word derivation and was used in many innovative formations that were not present in Proto-Indo-European. After the merger of ''*o'' and ''*a'', the resulting phoneme ''*a'' could lengthen to both ''*ā'' and ''*ō''.

Pre-Proto-Slavic retained many such uses of lengthened grades in morphology. The length distinctions are reflected as vowel quality distinctions in Late Common Slavic (LCS) and the later Slavic languages:
* Early Slavic ''*slāwā'' "fame, glory" &gt; LCS ''*slava'' (OCS ''[[wikt:слава#Old Church Slavonic|slava]]'') vs. Early Slavic ''*slawa'' "word" &gt; LCS ''*slovo'' (OCS ''[[wikt:слово#Old Church Slavonic|slovo]]'')
* Early Slavic ''*twāri'' "substance" &gt; LCS ''*tvarь'' (OCS ''[[wikt:тварь#Old Church Slavonic|tvarь]]'') vs. Early Slavic ''*twarītei'' "to form, create" &gt; ''*tvoriti'' (OCS ''[[wikt:творити#Old Church Slavonic|tvoriti]]'')

These are similar examples in Lithuanian:
* Lithuanian ''prõtas'' "intellect, mind" (&lt; ''*prāt-'') vs. ''pràsti'' "to understand"
* Lithuanian ''gė̃ris'' "goodness" (&lt; ''*gēr-'') vs. ''[[wikt:geras#Lithuanian|gẽras]]'' "good"

On the basis of the existing length alternations inherited from Proto-Indo-European, new alternations arose between the long ''*ī'', ''*ū'' and the short ''*i'', ''*u''. This latter type of apophony was not productive in PIE. Compare:
* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:mūšis#Lithuanian|mū̃šis]]'' "battle" versus ''mùšti'' "to kill, hit"
* Lithuanian ''lỹkis'' "remainder" versus ''lìkti'' "to stay, keep"

The new type of apophonic length was especially used in Pre-Proto-Slavic in the formation of durative, iterative and imperfective verbs. Compare:
* Early Slavic ''*dirātei'' "to tear (perfective)" &gt; LCS ''*dьrati'' (OCS ''[[wikt:дьрати#Old Church Slavonic|dьrati]]'') vs. Early Slavic ''*arz-dīrātei'' ("to tear (imperfective)") &gt; LCS ''*orzdirati'' (OCS ''razdirati'')
* Early Slavic ''*birātei'' "to pick" &gt; LCS ''*bьrati'' (OCS ''[[wikt:бьрати#Slavonic|bьrati]]'') vs. Early Slavic ''*bīrātei'' "to choose" &gt; LCS ''*birati'' (OCS ''birati'')

Certain pairs of words show a change of older initial ''*a-'' (from PIE {{PIE|*(H)a-}}, {{PIE|*(H)o-}}, {{PIE|*h₂e-}}, {{PIE|*h₃e-}}) to ''*e-'', which is sometimes called "Rozwadowski's rule". The exact conditioning of this change is currently not well understood, but led to alternations between ''*e-'' and ''*a-'' in related words or even as alternative forms of the same word. The alternations often gave rise to different initial vowels in different languages. Several words retained the alternation into Proto-Slavic times as well, which became an alternation between ''*(j)e-'' and ''*o-'':
* Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*elawa-'' / ''*alawa-'' "lead" &gt; Bulgarian (dial.) ''élavo'', Polish ''ołów'', Russian ''ólovo'', Old Prussian ''elwas'' ~ ''alwis''.
* Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*eźera-'' / ''*aźera-'' "lake" &gt; Serbo-Croatian ''jȅzero'', Polish ''jezioro'', Russian ''ózero'', Old Prussian ''assaran'', Latvian ''ezers'', Lithuanian ''ẽžeras'', Latgalian ''azars''.

==Morphology==
Proto-Balto-Slavic retained many of the grammatical features present in Proto-Indo-European.

===Nominals===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
Proto-Balto-Slavic made use of seven [[Grammatical case|cases]]:
* [[Nominative case|Nominative]] - subject
* [[Accusative case|Accusative]] - direct object
* [[Genitive case|Genitive]] - possession, relation or association; direct object of negated verb
* [[Locative case|Locative]] - stationary location
* [[Dative case|Dative]] - indirect object
* [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]] - tool, means by which, accompanying
* [[Vocative case|Vocative]] - direct address

The eighth case, the [[Ablative case|ablative]], had merged with the genitive case. Some of the inflectional endings for the genitive were replaced with those of the former ablative.

An innovation within Balto-Slavic was the use of the genitive in place of the accusative for the direct object of a negative verb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Matasović|2008|pp=56–57}} ''"Navedimo najvažnije baltoslavenske izoglose...Upotreba genitiva za izricanje objekta zanijekanog glagola"''&lt;/ref&gt; That feature is still present in its descendants:
* "I have read the book": Russian ''{{lang|ru|(я) чита́л кни́г'''у'''}}'' (''(ja) čitál kníg'''u'''''), Slovene ''{{lang|sl|sèm brál knjíg'''o'''}}'', Lithuanian ''{{lang|lt|knỹg'''ą''' skaičiau}}''
* "I have not read the book": Russian ''{{lang|ru|(я) не чита́л кни́г'''и'''}}'' (''(ja) ne čitál kníg'''i'''''), Slovene ''{{lang|sl|nísem brál knjíg'''e'''}}'', Lithuanian ''{{lang|lt|knỹg'''os''' neskaičiau}}''

Proto-Balto-Slavic still distinguished three [[Grammatical number|numbers]]: singular, dual and plural. The dual was retained into the early Slavic languages, but most modern Slavic languages have lost it. [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Chakavian]] (a dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian]]), and [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] are the only remaining Slavic languages that still make consistent use of the dual number.

In most other Slavic languages, the dual number is not retained except for historically-paired nouns (eyes, ears, shoulders), certain fixed expressions, and agreement of nouns when used with numbers; it is synchronically often analyzed as genitive singular because of the resemblance in forms. The Baltic languages also used to have a dual number system, but it has become practically obsolete in modern Latvian and Lithuanian.

Proto-Balto-Slavic nouns could also have one of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. Many originally neuter nouns in PIE had become masculine in Balto-Slavic so the group was somewhat reduced relative to the others. The modern Slavic languages largely continue the use of three grammatical genders, but modern Baltic languages primarily use only two: masculine and feminine. Latvian distinguishes between only two genders: masculine and feminine. Lithuanian distinguishes between only masculine and feminine in nouns, but in pronouns, participles and numerals, the neuter is retained.

An innovation within Balto-Slavic was the creation of a distinct "definite" inflection of adjectives by affixing forms of the pronoun ''*ja-'' to existing adjective forms. The inflection had a function resembling that of the definite article 'the' in English: Lithuanian ''{{lang|lt|geràsis}}'', Old Church Slavonic ''{{lang|cu|добрꙑи}}'' "the good" vs. ''{{lang|lt|gẽras}}'', ''{{lang|cu|добръ}}'' "good". The distinction is no longer productive in most Slavic languages today, and most Slavic languages preserve a mixture of definite forms and indefinite forms in a single paradigm.

Russian, Czech and Polish for example use the original definite nominative singular forms (Russian ''-ый, -ая, -ое'' (''-yj, -aja, -oje''), Polish ''-y, -a, -e'', Czech ''-ý, -á, -é''). Czech and Polish have lost the indefinite forms except in a few limited uses, while Russian preserves the indefinite nominative forms as the so-called "short forms", used in some cases in [[predicative expression|predicate]] position. Serbo-Croatian and Slovene still distinguish the two types but only in the masculine nominative singular (definite ''-i'' versus indefinite with no ending). Bulgarian and Macedonian have innovated completely new forms, affixing forms of the demonstrative pronoun ''*t-'' instead.

===Verbs===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
The distinction between athematic and thematic verbs was preserved, but athematic verbs were gradually reduced in number. The primary first-person singular endings, athematic ''*-mi'' and thematic ''*-oh₂'', were kept distinct, giving Balto-Slavic ''*-mi'' and ''*-ōˀ'' respectively. The thematic ending was occasionally extended by adding the athematic ending to it, apparently in Balto-Slavic times, resulting in a third ending: ''*-ōˀmi'' &gt; ''*-ōˀm'' &gt; ''*-am'', replacing the original ending in Slavic, reflected as ''*-ǫ'' (Russian ''-у'' (''-u''), Polish ''-ę'', Bulgarian ''-a'').

In many Slavic languages, particularly South and West Slavic, the athematic ending was analogically extended to other verbs and even replaced the thematic ending completely in some languages (Slovene, Serbo-Croatian). In the Baltic languages, only the thematic ending was retained, as Lithuanian ''-ù'' and Latvian ''-u'' (&lt; East Baltic ''*-uo'' &lt; Balto-Slavic ''*-ōˀ''). In Latvian, the first-person singular form of ''būt'' "to be" is ''esmu'', which preserves the original ''*-m-'' of the athematic ending, but it was extended with the thematic ending.

Balto-Slavic replaced the PIE second-person singular ending ''*-si'' with ''*-seHi'' &gt; ''*-sei'' for which the origin is not fully understood. According to Kortlandt, the ending is a combination of the ending ''*-si'' with ''*-eHi'', which he considers to be the original thematic ending.&lt;ref&gt;Kortlandt(1979:58)&lt;/ref&gt; The new ending, ''*-sei'', carried over into all three branches of Balto-Slavic and came to be used in all athematic root verbs in Baltic. In Old Church Slavonic, it completely ousted the older ending. In the other Slavic languages, the original ending generally survives except in the athematic verbs.

The aspectual distinction between present and aorist was retained and still productive in Proto-Balto-Slavic. It was preserved into early Slavic but was gradually replaced with an innovated aspectual distinction, with a variety of forms. Modern Bulgarian retained the aorist, however, alongside the innovated system, producing a four-way contrast. The Indo-European perfect/stative was falling out of use in Proto-Balto-Slavic and was likely already reduced to relics by Proto-Balto-Slavic times. It survives in Slavic only in the irregular Old Church Slavonic form ''vědě'' "I know" (&lt; Balto-Slavic ''*waidai'' &lt; PIE ''*weyd-'' "to see"), which preserves an irregular first-person singular ending, presumed to originate in the perfect.

Proto-Indo-European did not originally have an [[infinitive]], but it did have several constructions that served as action nouns. Two of these, the ''-tis'' and ''-tus'' nouns, remained in use into Balto-Slavic and acquired verbal noun and infinitive-like functions. They were not fully integrated into the verb system by Balto-Slavic times, however, and the individual Balto-Slavic languages diverge on the details. In Slavic and the Eastern Baltic languages, the infinitive was formed from a case form of the ''-tis'' noun: Lithuanian ''-ti'', Latvian ''-t'', Proto-Slavic ''*-ti''. Old Prussian, however, has ''-t'' and ''-twei'' as infinitive endings, the latter of which comes from the ''-tus'' noun instead. The shorter ''-t'' could come from either type.

==Development from Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Balto-Slavic==
[[Austrians|Austrian]] Balto-Slavist [[Georg Holzer]] has reconstructed a relative chronology of 50 Balto-Slavic sound changes, referring only to phonology, not to accentuation, from Proto-Balto-Slavic down to the modern daughter languages.&lt;ref&gt;Holzer 2001, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, only the first 12 are Common Balto-Slavic and so relevant for this article (only Winter's law is a unique common change):

# [[RUKI law]]: ''*s'' &gt; ''*š'' after ''*r'', ''*u'', ''*k'' or ''*i''.
# Laryngeals are lost between consonants in non-initial syllables.
# [[Winter's law]]: short vowels are lengthened when followed by a nonaspirated voiced stop (in some accounts, only in a closed syllable).
# ''*o'' &gt; ''*a''.
# Aspirated voiced stops lose their aspiration and merge with the plain voiced stops.
# Labiovelar stops lose their labialization and merge with the plain velars.
# [[Satemization]]: ''*ḱ'', ''*ǵ'' &gt; ''*ś'', ''*ź''.
# ''*ewV'' &gt; ''*awV''.
# ''*i'' (sometimes ''*u'') is inserted before syllabic sonorants, creating new liquid diphthongs.
# ''*wl'', ''*wr'' &gt; ''*l'', ''*r'' word-initially.

===Winter's law===
[[Winter's law]] caused lengthening of vowels if a plain voiced stop followed, and the new long vowels received the acute register. According to some analyses, the change occurred only if the stop was in [[syllable coda]] (the syllable ending with that consonant). It operated while there was still a phonemic distinction between plain and aspirated voiced stops, which later merged.

Consequently, the distinction between those two series has been indirectly preserved in Proto-Balto-Slavic by long acuted vowels. Furthermore, Winter's law took place before ''*o'' and ''*a'' merged, as it lengthened earlier ''*o'' to ''*ōˀ'' and ''*a'' to ''āˀ''.

On the basis of relative chronology of sound changes, it has been ascertained that Winter's law acted rather late, after some other less prominent Balto-Slavic changes had occurred such as after the disappearance of laryngeals in prevocalic position.{{sfn|Matasović|2008|p=83}} Compare:
* PIE {{PIE|''*eǵh₂om''}} &gt; Pre-Balto-Slavic ''*eźHom'' &gt; (Winter's law) ''*ēźHom'' &gt; Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*ēźun'' &gt; Common Slavic ''*(j)azъ́'' &gt; [[Old Church Slavonic|OCS]] ''[[wikt:азъ#Old Church Slavonic|azъ]]'', Slovene ''[[wikt:jaz#Slovene|jaz]]''.

===Satemization===
Proto-Balto-Slavic generally shows [[Centum-Satem isogloss|Satem]] reflexes of the three velar series: labiovelars merge into the plain velars while palatovelars develop into sibilants (''*ś'' and ''*ź'').

There are a number of words in Balto-Slavic that show Centum reflexes instead, with palatovelars appearing as plain velars. A number can be explained by regular sound laws, but some laws have been obscured by numerous [[Analogy#Linguistics|analogical]] developments. Others are argued to be borrowings from Centum languages.

For example, Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*kárˀwāˀ'' 'cow' (Lithuanian ''[[wikt:karvė#Lithuanian|kárvė]]'', OCS ''krava'', Russian ''[[wikt:корова#Russian|koróva]]'') is likely a feminine derivation of a lost masculine noun that was likely borrowed from [[Proto-Celtic]] ''*karwos'' "deer" (Middle Welsh ''carw'', Middle Breton ''karo'', Middle Cornish ''carow''), which in turn is a regular reflex of PIE {{PIE|''*ḱr̥h₂wos''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eugen|first1=Hill|editor1-last=Nielsen Whitehead|editor1-first=Benedicte|editor2-last=Olander|editor2-first=Thomas|editor3-last=Olsen|editor3-first=Birgit Anette|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Rasmussen|editor4-first=Jens Elmegård|title=The Sound of Indo-European – Phonetics, Phonemics and Morphophonemics|date=2012|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|location=Copenhagen|page=190|url=https://www.academia.edu/3727224/Hidden_sound_laws_in_the_inflectional_morphology_of_Proto-Indo-European._A_phonological_account_of_the_primary_first_singular_of_thematic_verbs_and_the_instrumental_case_of_thematic_nouns_and_adjectives|accessdate=11 October 2015|chapter=Hidden sound laws in the inflectional morphology of Proto-Indo-European}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PIE palatovelars could also depalatalize in Balto-Slavic. Several depalatalization rules for Balto-Slavic have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;For an alternative formulation, see {{Harvcoltxt|Kortlandt|1978|pp=12–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Matasović,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matasović|2008|pp=86}}. For a more precise formulation of the rule, see {{Harvcoltxt|Matasović|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; the depalatalization of palatovelars occurred before sonorant followed by a back vowel: K' &gt; K/_RV&lt;sup&gt;back&lt;/sup&gt;. That would explain Centum reflexes such as these ones:
* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:akmuo#Lithuanian|akmuõ]]'', Latvian ''[[wikt:akmens#Latvian|akmens]]'' and OCS ''[[wikt:камꙑ#Old Church Slavonic|kamy]]'' would have regular /k/ as opposed to Sanskrit ''[[wikt:अश्मन्#Sanskrit|áśmā]]'' &lt; PIE {{PIE|''*h₂eḱmō''}} "stone".
* OCS ''[[wikt:свєкрꙑ#Old Church Slavonic|svekry]]'' &lt; PIE {{PIE|''*sweḱruh₂''}} "mother-in-law".
* Old Prussian ''balgnan'' &lt; PIE {{PIE|''*bʰolǵʰno-''}} "saddle".

Another view is that satemization occurred in Baltic and Slavic independently after Slavic had split off.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===RUKI law===
PIE ''*s'' was preserved in Balto-Slavic in most positions. According to the [[Ruki sound law|RUKI law]], it became ''*š'' when it was preceded by ''*r'', ''*u'', ''*k'' or ''*i''. It also included diphthongs ending in ''*u'' or ''*i'', the long vowels ''*ū'' and ''*ī'' (whether original or from a following laryngeal), and the voiced velar ''*g''.

Among the Balto-Slavic languages, the evidence of RUKI rule is recognizable only in Lithuanian and Slavic because in the other languages ''*š'', ''*ś'' and ''*s'' all merge into plain ''*s''. In Lithuanian, ''*š'' and ''*ś'' are merged to ''*š'' instead, remaining distinct from ''*s''. In Slavic, ''*ś'' merges with ''s'' but ''*š'' remains distinct (and becomes ''*x'' before back vowels).

Most handbooks, on the basis of Lithuanian material, state that in Baltic RUKI law has been applied only partially. The most common claim is that the law applied unconditionally in Lithuanian only after ''*r'', while after ''*u'', ''*k'' and ''*i'', both ''*s'' and ''*š'' occur. Compare:
* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:aušra#Lithuanian|aušrà]]'' "dawn" &lt; PIE {{PIE|''*h₂ewsro-''}} (compare Latin ''[[wikt:aurora#Latin|aurōra]]'', Sanskrit ''[[wikt:उषस्#Sanskrit|uṣás]]''), with RUKI applied.
* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:ausis#Lithuanian|ausìs]]'' "ear" &lt; PIE {{PIE|''*h₂ews-''}} (compare Latin ''[[wikt:auris#Latin|auris]]'') reflects ''*s'' while Slavic ''*uxo'' reflects ''*š'' instead.
* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:maišas#Lithuanian|maĩšas]]'' "sack" &lt; PIE {{PIE|''*moyso-''}} (compare Sanskrit ''[[wikt:मेष#Sanskrit|meṣá]]'') reflects ''*š'', matching Slavic ''*měxъ''.
* Lithuanian ''[[wikt:teisus#Lithuanian|teisùs]]'' reflects ''*s'' while Slavic ''*tixъ'' reflects ''*š''.

There is no simple solution to such double reflexes the RUKI law in Lithuanian and thus no simple answer to the question of whether RUKI law is a common Balto-Slavic isogloss or not. The most probable answer seems to be the assumption that PIE ''*s'' was changed to ''*š'' after ''*r'', ''*u'', ''*k'', ''*i'' completely regularly within Balto-Slavic proper, but the traces of the effect of RUKI law were erased by subsequent changes in Lithuanian such as the change of word-final ''*-š'' to ''*-s''.

Generally, it can be ascertained that Lithuanian shows the effect of RUKI law only in old words inherited from Balto-Slavic period so Lithuanian ''š'' appears in words that have a complete formational and morphological correspondence in Slavic (ruling out the possibility of accidental, parallel formations).

It appears that palatovelars yielded fricatives in Balto-Slavic before the effect of RUKI law, so that {{PIE|''*ḱs''}} appears simply as ''*ś''. Compare:
* Slavic ''*desnъ'' "right (i.e. opposite to left)" (OCS ''[[wikt:дєснъ#Old Church Slavonic|desnъ]]'', Russian ''désnyj'', Serbo-Croatian ''[[wikt:desni#Serbo-Croatian|dèsnī]]''), Lithuanian ''dešinys'' &lt; Balto-Slavic ''*deśna-'' &lt; PIE {{PIE|''*deḱs-no-''}} (Latin ''[[wikt:dexter#Latin|dexter]]'', Sanskrit ''[[wikt:दक्षिण#Sanskrit|dákṣiṇas]]'')
* Slavic ''*osь'' "axle, axis" (OCS ''osь'', Russ. ''[[wikt:ось#Russian|os’]]'', SCr. ''[[wikt:os#Serbo-Croatian|ȏs]]''), Lithuanian ''ašis'' &lt; Balto-Slavic ''*aśi-'' &lt; PIE {{PIE|*h₂eḱsi-}} (Latin ''[[wikt:axis#Latin|axis]]'', Sanskrit ''[[wikt:अक्ष#Sanskrit|ákṣas]]'')

===Syllabic sonorants===
The Proto-Indo-European syllabic sonorants ''*l̥'', ''*r̥'', ''*m̥'' and ''*n̥'' (abbreviated ''*R̥'') developed a prothetic vowel in front of them, converting them into "sonorant diphthongs". Both ''*i'' and ''*u'' appear as prothetic vowels, yielding reflexes ''*im'', ''*in'', ''*ir'', ''*il'' (''*iR'') and ''*um'', ''*un'', ''*ur'', ''*ul'' (''*uR''). It has remained an unsolved problem to this day as to the exact phonological conditions that trigger which reflex. Regardless, analysis of their distribution has shown that ''*i'' appears much more often, suggesting that it is the default reflex, with ''*u'' appearing only in special cases. In a sample of 215 Balto-Slavic lexical items, 36 (17%) are attested only with ''*uR'' reflexes, 22 (10%) with both reflexes in the same language or branch or with one in Slavic and the other in Baltic, and the remaining 157 (73%) are attested only with ''*iR'' reflex.{{sfn|Andersen|2003|p=60}}

Several theories have been proposed, the most notable being the one by [[André Vaillant]] from 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillant, André, "Grammaire comparée des langues slaves. Tome I, Phonétique", IAC, Lyon 1950, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, ''*u'' arose after PIE labiovelars. If true, it would be the only trace of PIE labiovelars in Balto-Slavic.

After surveying [[Reinhold Trautmann]]'s 1924 Balto-Slavic dictionary, [[Jerzy Kuryłowicz]] in 1956 found no phonologically consistent distribution for the dual reflexes except in a single position: after PIE palatovelars Baltic and Slavic have only ''*iR'' reflex.&lt;ref&gt;c, Jerzy, 1956. "L’apophonie en indo-europeée". Wrocław: Ossolineum. Pages 227–242.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Shevelov]] in 1965 inspected Slavic data in much detail, but in the end, he demonstrated only that the
distribution of the dual reflexes in Slavic is not reducible to phonological conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Shevelov, George  Y. 1965. ''A  Prehistory  of  Slavic. The Historical Phonology  of  Common Slavic''. New York: Columbia University Press. Pages 86–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an analysis by [[Christian Stang]] in 1966 Kuryłowicz's statistics proved only that ''*iR'' reflexes are much more frequent than ''*uR'' reflexes.{{sfn|Stang|1966|p=79}} Stang made several important observations:
* Balto-Slavic grammatical morphemes have ''*iR'' reflexes, but no ''*uR'' reflexes
* ''*iR'' reflexes are productive in ablaut alternations, while ''*uR'' are not
* many words containing ''*uR'' diphthongs have an expressive meaning,{{sfn|Stang|1966|p=79-80}} meaning (i) "fat", "dumb", "lazy", "clumsy",  (ii) "crooked, bent",  (iii)  "crippled, decrepit", (iv) "dark",  "dirty",  or (v) they are of onomatopoeic origin. Such words could have been innovated at various times during the prehistory and have no relation to the Balto-Slavic reflexes of PIE ''*R̥''. Such ''u'' + sonorant combinations reflect a [[Linguistic universal|universal semantic category]];{{sfn|Andersen|2003|p=62}} compare English ''plump'', ''dumb'', ''bungle'', ''bulky'', ''clumsy'', ''glum'', ''dumpy'' etc.; German ''dumm'', ''dumpf'', ''stumm'', ''stumpf'', ''plump'' etc.

Stang's analysis indicates that ''*iR'' was the regular result of the diphthongization of PIE syllabic sonorants. Doublets with expressive meaning are then explained as expressively motivated ''*uR'' replacements of the original ''*iR'' reflex, or as borrowings from substratum dialects (such as Germanic) that regularly had the ''*R̥'' &gt; ''*uR'' reflex, when (pre-)Balto-Slavic no longer had syllabic sonorants and were then used side by side with the original reflex.

According to Jānis Endzelīns and Reinhold Trautmann ''*uR'' reflex resulted in zero-grade of morphemes that had PIE ''*o'' (&gt; Balto-Slavic ''*a'') in normal grade.

Matasović, in 2008, {{sfn|Matasović|2008|p=111}} proposed the following rules:
# At first, syllabic sonorants develop a prothetic schwa: ''*R̥'' &gt; ''*əR''.
# ''*ə'' &gt; ''*i'' in a final syllable.
# ''*ə'' &gt; ''*u'' after velars and before nasals.
# ''*ə'' &gt; ''*i'' otherwise.

===Laryngeals and the acute register===
Laryngeals generally disappeared as independent phonemes. When they appeared after a vowel, they caused compensatory lengthening of that vowel, as in almost all Indo-European branches. Laryngeals between consonants disappeared as well, but in the first syllable, they are reflected as ''*a''. Compare:
* PIE {{PIE|''*(h₁)rh̥₃deh₂''}} "heron, stork" (Ancient Greek ''erōdiós'', Latin ''[[wikt:ardea#Latin|ardea]]'') &gt; Slavic ''*roda'' (Serbo-Croatian ''[[wikt:roda#Serbo-Croatian|róda]]'').
* PIE {{PIE|''*sh̥₂l-''}} (oblique case stem of {{PIE|''*seh₂ls''}} "salt") &gt; Old Prussian ''sal'', Slavic ''*solь'' (OCS ''[[wikt:соль#Old Church Slavonic|solь]]'', Polish ''[[wikt:sól#Polish|sól]]'', Russian ''[[wikt:соль#Russian|solʹ]]'').

Syllabic sonorants followed by laryngeals do not show any different outcome from syllabic sonorants in other environments. Balto-Slavic shares that characteristic with Germanic but no other Indo-European languages, which show clearly distinct reflexes in this case. Compare:
* PIE ''*pl̥h₁nós'' &gt; Proto-Balto-Slavic ''*pilˀnas'' (Slavic ''*pьlnъ'', Lithuanian ''pìlnas''), &gt; Proto-Germanic ''*fullaz'' (&lt; earlier ''*fulnaz'', with regular ''*l̥'' &gt; ''*ul''; English ''full''), but &gt; Latin ''plēnus'' (''*n̥'' &gt; ''en'' normally).

It appears, however, that laryngeals left traces in Balto-Slavic: they triggered the "acute" register on a preceding vowel or sonorant diphthong, as an articulatory "residue". While laryngeals were the most important source of the acute in Balto-Slavic, they were not the only source. The acute emerges in the following cases:
# In all syllables closed by a laryngeal in PIE, whether lengthening of a preceding vowel occurred or not. In particular, it also occurred in syllables with a sonorant diphthong. It probably also occurred when the preceding vowel was already in the lengthened grade.
# In all syllables closed by a voiced stop in PIE, and were lengthened according to the Winter's law.
# In all cases of vowel lengthening within Balto-Slavic: all vowel lengthening that occurred as part of word formations only within the Balto-Slavic period and did not originate in PIE, which included the new alternations ''*u'' ~ ''*ū'' and ''*i'' ~ ''*ī'' that were innovated within Balto-Slavic. It also included ''*ūn'' from earlier ''*un'' before a stop (more details below).

The rules governing the emergence of the acute in Balto-Slavic seem complicated when they are formulated within the framework of "classical" Proto-Indo-European [[laryngeal theory]], as there is no obvious connection between laryngeals and voiced stops, both of which trigger the acute register. [[Frederik Kortlandt]] has proposed an alternative, more elegant and economic rule for the derivation of Balto-Slavic acute by using the [[glottalic theory]] framework of Proto-Indo-European. He proposed that the acute is a reflex of a [[glottal stop]], which has two sources, the  merger of PIE laryngeals and the dissolution of PIE pre-glottalized stop ("voiced stops" in traditional reconstruction) to glottal stop and voiced stop, according to the Winter's law. Kortlandt's formulation appears very elegant initially and seems to be confirmed independently by a glottal stop in Latvian as a reflex of Balto-Slavic acute in words in which accent was retracted, and it in accordance with the typological [[linguistic universal|universal]]: most languages with high tone is developed in syllables closed with a glottal stop (however, in Lithuanian, it developed into a falling tone, the opposite of the other languages). Rising tone can then be explained as a result of the development of high tone on the second mora of a long syllable.

Though elegant, Kortlandt's theory also has some problems. The glottalic theory, which was proposed in the 1970s, is not generally accepted among linguists, and today only a small minority of linguists would consider it a reliable and self-supportive framework onto which to base modern Indo-European research. Also, there is a number of Balto-Slavic lexemes which point to acute accent but that are provably not of PIE laryngeal origin, and some of them were a result of apophonical lengthenings occurring only in Balto-Slavic period.

Matasović (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matasović|2008|pp=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following scenario as the most probable origin of Balto-Slavic acute:
# The acute initially arose in the syllables closed by a laryngeal, partly from the retraction of word-final accent onto such syllables, which were phonologically long ([[Hirt's law]]). Other long syllables, if they bore the accent, were circumflexed, with later falling tone.
# Later, new Balto-Slavic long vowels were acuted.
# The younger acute has been largely eliminated in Slavic by [[Meillet's law]].

===Nasals===
Word-finally, ''*m'' became ''*n'' in Balto-Slavic. Final nasals are not directly preserved in most Balto-Slavic languages, however, making evidence mostly indirect. Old Prussian uniquely preserves final ''*-n'', and there is indeed a clear attestation of the change in the nominative-accusative of neuters, such as ''[[wikt:assaran#Old Prussian|assaran]]'' "lake" &lt; PIE {{PIE|''*eǵʰerom''}}. In the other Baltic languages, no final nasals are retained. Lithuanian has vowel lengthening that reflects earlier nasal vowels, but they could conceivably come from either final ''-n'' or ''-m'' and thus do not provide evidence either way. In Slavic, all word-final consonants are lost in one way or another so there is no direct evidence there either.

However, there is indirect evidence in the form of [[sandhi]] effects that were preserved in some Slavic pronouns. For example, Old Church Slavonic attests constructions like ''sъ nimь'' "with him", which can be traced to the Balto-Slavic ''*śun eimis'' where the first word reflects the common Proto-Indo-European preposition ''*ḱom'' "with" (compare Latin ''cum''), and the second reflects the PIE pronominal stem ''*ey-'' (Latin ''is'', German ''er''). In Slavic, in accordance with the "[[Law of Open Syllables]]", the final ''-n'' of the preposition was reinterpreted as belonging to the pronoun, which acted to preserve the nasal in its Balto-Slavic form, thus corroborating that it was indeed ''-n'': If the change of ''*-m'' to ''*-n'' had not taken place at an earlier stage, the phrase would have been ''*śu'''m''' eimis'', which would have given ''*sъ '''m'''imь'' in OCS instead.

===Vowels===
The following changes to vowels in Proto-Balto-Slavic can be noted:

* Long vowels are shortened before word-final ''*-n''. Thus, the ā-stem accusative singular, originally ''*-āˀm'', was shortened to ''*-an'': Lithuanian ''-ą'', Old Prussian ''-an'', Slavic ''*-ǫ''. If the genitive plural ending was originally ''*-ōm'', it was shortened to ''*-on'' by this change.
* Word-final ''*-os'' and ''*-on'' are raised to ''*-us'' and ''*-un'' when stressed, e.g. ''*eǵHóm'' &gt; Balto-Slavic ''*eźún'', ''*aźún'', ''*ōˀźún'' &gt; Slavic ''*ãzъ''. This causes a split in the o-stem paradigm, which is levelled in various ways later on. In Baltic, the nominals with original ending stress are transferred to the u-stem inflection. In Slavic, masculines of the two types are conflated and merge almost completely in most modern languages.
* Word-final ''*-mi'' is reduced to ''*-n'' after a long vowel. This change occurred after the shortening, so that the vowel remained long and, if applicable, acuted. For example, the ā-stem instrumental singular ending ''*-āmi'' was reduced to ''*-ān'' &gt; Lithuanian ''-à'', Slavic ''*-ǫ'' (compared to the o-stem ending ''*-ami'' &gt; Slavic ''*-omь'').
* ''*o'' &gt; ''*a''
* ''*un'' is lengthened to ''*ūˀn'' (with acute) when a stop followed.{{clarify|reason=What about -ūns in the o-stem accusative plural?|date=November 2016}} In Slavic, it is reflected as ''*y'', with no nasal. For example: PIE ''*Hunk-'' "to get used to" &gt; Balto-Slavic ''*ūnk-'' &gt; Lithuanian ''jùnkti'', Latvian ''jûkt'', OCS ''vyknǫti'', Upper Sorbian ''wuknyć''. ''*in'' did not exhibit lengthening in such conditions, as older literature often states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Matasović|2008|pp=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accentual system===

The [[Proto-Indo-European accent]] was completely reworked in Balto-Slavic, with far-reaching consequences for accentual systems of the modern daughter languages. The development was conditioned by several delicate factors, such as the syllable length, presence of a laryngeal closing the syllable, and the position of PIE ictus. There is still no consensus among Balto-Slavists on the precise details of the development of Balto-Slavic accentual system. All modern research is based on the seminal study of Stang (1957), which basically instituted the field of comparative Balto-Slavic accentology. However, many laws and correspondences have been discovered and are now held to be true by the majority of researchers even if the exact details sometimes remain in dispute.

Early Balto-Slavic retained a simple accent in which only the placement of the accent was distinctive, but there were no pitch distinctions. The acute register was initially no more than an articulatory feature on certain syllables and could occur independently of accent placement. However, the acute was the trigger for several sound changes that affected the placement of the accent. For example, under [[Hirt's law]], the accent tended to shift leftwards onto a syllable that bore the acute.

On accented syllables, the acute came to be accompanied by a distinct pitch contour in late Proto-Balto-Slavic. Consequently, accented syllables of any type that could carry the acute register in Proto-Balto-Slavic (listed above) now differed in pitch contour as well as articulation; they had rising or falling pitch (whether accented acute syllables had rising or falling pitch differed by dialect). The tonal accents that emerged from this process are called "acute accent" and "circumflex accent" in Balto-Slavic linguistics.

Syllables with a single short vowel could not bear the acute register and so also had tonal distinctions. When accented, they had the same pitch contour (though nondistinctive) as a circumflex-accented syllable. The syllables are said to have "short accent".

To reconstruct the Balto-Slavic accent, the most important are those languages that have retained tonal oppositions: Lithuanian, Latvian, (probably) Old Prussian and the West South Slavic languages of Slovene and Serbo-Croatian. However, one should keep in mind that the prosodical systems of dialects in the aforementioned languages are sometimes very different from those of [[standard language]]s. For example, some Croatian dialects like [[Čakavian]] and Posavian dialects of [[Slavonia]]n Štokavian are especially important for Balto-Slavic accentology, as they retain more archaic and complex tonal accentual system than the Neoštokavian dialect on which modern [[standard language|standard]] varieties of Serbo-Croatian ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]) are based. On the other hand, many dialects have completely lost tonal oppositions (such as some [[Kajkavian]] varieties, the Zagreb spoken nonstandard idiom).

A minority view, originating from [[Vladimir Dybo]], considers Balto-Slavic accentuation (based on correspondences in the Germanic, Celtic, and Italic languages) more archaic than Greek-Vedic and therefore closer to Proto-Indo-European.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Dybo, Nikolajev &amp; Starostin:1978, Nikolaev:1989, Dybo 2007:47-50&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notation====
What follows is a short overview of the commonly used diacritical marks for Balto-Slavic (BSl.) accents and/or prosodic features, all based on the example letter ''a''. In each case, there is a crude characterization of the pronunciation in terms of High, Mid, and Low-tone sequences.

* Lithuanian: "falling"/HL (acute) ''á'', "rising"/H(L)H (circumflex) ''ã'', "short"/H ''à''
* Latvian (on ''all'' syllables): "falling"/HL ''à'', "rising"/LH (or "lengthened") ''ã'', "broken"/L'H ''â''
* Slovenian: "falling"/HL ''ȃ'', "rising"/LH ''á'', "short"/H ''ȁ''
* Serbo-Croatian:&lt;ref&gt;All examples given for Serbo-Croatian are based on the standard language, stylised Neoštokavian dialect; they are accented according to the ''Rječnik hrvatskoga jezika'', F. Broz and I. Iveković, Zagreb 1901 and ''Akademijin Rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika'', XXIII volumes, 1880–1976&lt;/ref&gt; "short falling"/HL ''ȁ'', "long falling"/HML ''ȃ'', "short rising"/LH ''à'', "long rising"/LMH ''á'', "posttonic length" ''ā''
* Common Slavic: "short falling"/HL (short circumflex) ''ȁ'', "long falling"/HML (long circumflex) ''ȃ'', "acute"/LH (old acute, old rising") ''a̋'', "neoacute"/L(M)H (old acute, old rising") ''á'' or ''ã''

In Croatian dialects, especially Čakavian and Posavian, the "neoacute" ("new acute", a new rising tone) is usually marked with tilde, as ''ã''. Short neoacute ("short new rising") is marked as ''à''. Neoacutes represent a post–Proto-Slavic development.

Here is a reverse key to help decode the various diacritical marks:

* [[acute accent]] (''á''): Usually long rising and/or BSl. acute. Neoacute in some Slavic reconstructions. The default accent when a language has only one phonemic prosodic feature (such as stress in Russian, length in Czech). Marks long falling in Lithuanian because this derives from BSl. acute.
* [[grave accent]] (''à''): Usually short rising or simply short.
* [[circumflex accent]] (''â''): BSl. circumflex in reconstructions. Broken tone in modern Baltic (Latvian and [[Žemaitian]] Lithuanian), a vowel with a glottal stop in the middle (derives from BSl. acute). Long falling in modern Slavic languages.
* [[tilde]] (''ã''): Alternative notation for BSl. circumflex in reconstructions. Long rising in various modern languages (Lithuanian, Latvian, archaic Serbo-Croatian dialects such as [[Chakavian]]). Derives from diverse sources: Lithuanian &lt; BSl. circumflex, Latvian &lt; BSl. acute, Serbo-Croatian dialects &lt; long Common Slavic neoacute (from accentual retraction).
* [[double grave accent]] (''ȁ''): Usually short falling (mostly in Slavic). Derived from circumflex (= long falling) by converting the "acute" portion of the accent to a grave, much as a simple acute (= long rising) is shortened by conversion to a grave.
* [[double acute accent]] (''a̋''): Old acute in some Slavic reconstructions. (As opposed to a single acute for Slavic neoacute in reconstructions. Based on the fact that the old acute was shortened in Common Slavic.)
* [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (''ā''): Vowel length, particularly in syllables without tone (such as unstressed syllables in Slavic).
* [[breve]] (''ă''): Vowel shortness.

There are multiple competing systems used for different languages and different periods. The most important are these:
# Three-way system of Proto-Slavic, Proto-Balto-Slavic, modern Lithuanian: acute tone (''á'') vs. circumflex tone (''â'' or ''ã'') vs. short accent (''à'').
# Four-way Serbo-Croatian system, also used in Slovenian and often in Slavic reconstructions: long rising (''á''), short rising (''à''), long falling (''â''), short falling (''ȁ'').
# Two-way length: long (''ā'') vs. short (''ă'').
# Length only, as in Czech and Slovak: long (''á'') vs. short (''a'').
# Stress only, as in Russian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian: stressed (''á'') vs. unstressed (''a'').

Many nonprosodic marks are also found in various languages in combinations with certain letters. The various combinations of letter and diacritic should normally be viewed as single symbols (i.e. as equivalent to such simple symbols as ''a, b, c ...'').

Examples on vowels:
* [[ogonek]] (''ą''): With a rightward-curving hook unlike the leftward-curving [[cedilla]] (''ç''): Vowel [[nasalization]]. In Standard Lithuanian, the nasalization is historical and the vowels are now simply reflected as long vowels, but some dialects still preserve nasalized vowels. Occasionally used to indicate [[low-mid]] quality in ''e, o''.
* [[overdot]] (''ė ȯ''), [[underdot]] (''ẹ ọ''): [[High-mid]] vowel quality {{IPA|[e o]}}, distinguished from plain ''e o'' indicating [[low-mid]] vowels {{IPA|[ɛ ɔ]}}. The overdot is normally found in Lithuanian, the underdot in Slovenian.
* [[inverted breve]] below (''e̯ i̯ o̯ u̯''), indicating nonsyllabic vowels (often, it is the second part of a diphthong).
* [[háček]] (''ě''): With a pointed ''v'' shape, rather than the rounded ''u'' shape of the [[breve]]: ''ě'', in Slavic reconstructions, is a vowel known as [[yat]], distinct in length and later quality from simple ''e'' (originally longer and lower; later, longer and higher in many dialects), but ''ě'', in Czech, sometimes indicates instead a simple ''e'', with palatalization of the preceding consonant (''dě'' ''tě'' ''ně'').
* ''ô, ó, ů'' originally indicated a [[high-mid]] {{IPA|[o]}} or diphthongized {{IPA|[uo]}} in various Slavic languages (respectively: Slovak/dialectal Russian; Polish/[[Upper Sorbian]]/[[Lower Sorbian]]; Czech). It now indicates {{IPA|[u]}} in Polish and long {{IPA|[uː]}} in Czech.

Examples in consonants:
* Most diacritics on consonants indicate various sorts of palatal sounds such as an [[acute accent]] (''ć ǵ ḱ ĺ ń ŕ ś ź''), a [[comma]] (''ģ ķ ļ ņ''), a [[haček]] (''č ď ľ ň ř š ť ž'') or an [[overbar]] (''đ''). They can indicate three:
**[[palatoalveolar]]s (''č š ž''): They have a "hushing" pronunciation {{IPA|[tʃ ʃ ʒ]}}, as in English ''kitchen, mission, vision'' and are less palatal than the sounds indicated by ''ć ś ź'';
**[[alveolopalatal]]s (''ć đ ś ź'', as in Polish and Serbo-Croatian);
**[[palatal stop]]s (voiceless ''ḱ/ķ/ť'' and voiced ''ǵ/ģ/ď" in Macedonian, Latvian and Czech, respectively);
**a [[palatal nasal]] (''ń ņ ň'');
**a [[palatal lateral]] (''ĺ ļ ľ''); or
**a palatalized trill (''ŕ'', also ''ř'' in Czech specifically for a [[fricative trill]]).
* In Slovak,'' ĺ'' and ''ŕ'' indicate doubled rather than palatal(ized) consonants (vŕba=willow, hĺbka=depth).
* In western West Slavic (Polish, Kashubian, [[Upper Sorbian]] and [[Lower Sorbian]]), ''ż'' indicates a [[voiced retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[ʐ]}}. (Other such sibilants are indicated by digraphs like ''cz'', ''sz''.)
* In western West Slavic, ''ł'' indicates a sound that was once a dark (velarized) ''l'' but is now usually pronounced [w].

====Accent paradigms==== &lt;!--LINKED FROM REDIRECTS [[Mobile paradigm]] and [[Fixed paradigm]]--&gt;
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
{{missing information|section|verb accent paradigms|date=April 2014}}
Proto-Balto-Slavic, just like Proto-Indo-European, had a class of nominals with so called "mobile" accentuation in which accent alternated between the word stem and the ending. The classes of nominals are usually reconstructed on the basis of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] and [[Ancient Greek]], which have retained the position of the original PIE accent almost unchanged. However, by comparing the Balto-Slavic evidence, it was discovered that the PIE rules on accent alternations, devised on the basis of Vedic and Greek, do not match those found in Balto-Slavic.

Moreover, nominals that belong to mobile paradigms in Balto-Slavic belong to declension classes that always had fixed accent in PIE paradigms: ā-stems and o-stems. For a long time, the exact relationships between the accentuation of nominals in Balto-Slavic and PIE was one of the most mysterious questions of Indo-European studies, and some parts of the puzzle are still missing.

Research conducted by [[Christian Stang]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Vladimir Dybo]] has led to a conclusion that Balto-Slavic nominals, with regard to accentuation, could be reduced to two paradigms: fixed and mobile. Nominals of the fixed paradigm had accent on one of the stem syllables, and in the nominals of the mobile paradigm, the accent alternated between the stem and the ending. As shown by Illič-Svityč, Balto-Slavic nominals of the fixed paradigm correspond to the PIE nominals with accent on the root (PIE barytones). The only exception were nominals with the accent on the ending (PIE oxytones) when it was shifted onto the root in Balto Slavic in accordance with [[Hirt's law]]; such nominals also have fixed accent in Balto-Slavic.

The origin of the Balto-Slavic nominals of the mobile paradigm has not been completely determined, with several proposed theories of origin. According to Illič-Svityč, they originate as an analogical development from fixed-accent PIE oxytones. That theory has been criticized as leaving unclear why PIE nominals with fixed accent on the ending would become mobile, as analogies usually lead to uniformity and regularity. According to [[Antoine Meillet|Meillet]] and [[Christian Schweigaard Stang|Stang]], Balto-Slavic accentual mobility was inherited from PIE consonant and vowel-stems but not for o-stems, where they represent Balto-Slavic innovation. Vedic and Greek lost the accentual mobility in vowel stems, retaining it only in consonant stems. [[Ferdinand de Saussure|De Saussure]] explained it as a result of accent retraction in the medially stressed syllables of consonant-stems exhibiting the hysterokinetic paradigm, with vocalic stems subsequently imitating the new accentual patterns by analogy. According to [[Vladimir Dybo|Dybo]] the position of Balto-Slavic accent is determined by a formula from PIE tones according to the ''valence theory'' developed by the Moscow school, which presupposes [[PIE accent#Modern theories|lexical tone in PIE]]. Kortlandt up to 2006 supported the theory of Balto-Slavic losing PIE consonant-stem accentual mobility in nominals, and innovating everywhere else, but after 2006 maintains that the original PIE accentual mobility was preserved in Balto-Slavic in ā-stems (eh₂-stems), i-stems, u-stems and consonant-stems.

The Balto-Slavic accentual system was further reworked during the Proto-Slavic and Common Slavic period ([[Dybo's law]], [[Meillet's law]], [[Ivšić's law]], etc.), resulting in three Common Slavic accentual paradigms (conventionally indicated using the letters ''A'', ''B'', ''C''), corresponding to four Lithuanian accentual paradigms (indicated with the numbers ''1'', ''2'', ''3'', ''4'') in a simple scheme:

=====Fixed paradigm with acuted root=====
The simplest accentuation is that of nominals which were acuted on the root in Balto-Slavic. They remain accented on the root (''root'' here is understood in the Proto-Balto-Slavic, not the PIE sense) throughout the paradigm in Baltic (Lithuanian ''first accentual paradigm'') and Slavic (''accent paradigm a'').

* Russian exhibits "[[polnoglasie]]", in which liquid diphthongs receive an epenthetic vowel after them. An acute-accented liquid diphthong yields accent on the epenthetic vowel; a circumflex-accented one results in accent on the first (original) vowel (''-árˀ-'' &gt; ''-oró-'', ''-ar-'' &gt; ''-óro-''). Serbo-Croatian and Slovene show metathesis instead.
* Serbo-Croatian does not reflect the acute as a tonal distinction but shows short falling accent consistently for all words with post-Slavic initial accent regardless of tone. The short falling accent in the genitive plural has been lengthened due to the loss of a [[yer]]. The addition of ''-ā'' is a later innovation.
* Slovene has a rising vowel, which reflects the original acute. All short accented vowels in non-final syllables were lengthened, which eliminated the length distinction in the genitive plural.

=====Fixed paradigm with non-acuted root=====
In the nouns with non-mobile initial accent, which did not have an acuted root syllable, both Lithuanian and Slavic had an independent accent shift occur, from the root to the ending. In Lithuanian, they are the nouns of the ''second accent paradigm'' and in Slavic, the ''accent paradigm b''.

Lithuanian noun ''rankà'' "hand" etymologically corresponds to Russian ''[[wikt:рука#Russian|ruká]]'' and Serbo-Croatian ''[[wikt:ruka#Serbo-Croatian|rúka]]'', but both became mobile in a later Common Slavic development so the reflexes of the Proto-Slavic noun ''*juxá'' "soup" are listed instead.

* In Lithuanian, the initial accent was preserved in all cases where the ending did not contain an acuted syllable. In the forms that had an acuted ending (nominative, vocative and instrumental singular, accusative plural), the accent shifted onto the ending, in accordance with the rule discovered by de Saussure. Later, that acuted syllable was shortened by Leskien's law.
* In Slavic, the accent shifted from the root onto the ending in accordance with [[Dybo's law]], regardless of the syllable nature (whether it was acuted in Balto-Slavic or not) so the nouns of the B paradigm are consistently accented on the ending (oxytonic, except in the instrumental plural).
* In the Neoštokavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian, which are used as the basis for standard Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian, the so-called "Neoštokavian retraction" occurred: the accent was retracted from the ending onto the root syllable and became rising. Old Štokavian and Čakavian dialects preserved the original ending-stressed paradigm.
* Slovene also has retraction of the accent, which results in a long rising tone.

=====Mobile paradigm=====
Nominals with mobile accent had in some cases an accented first syllable, in others an accented ending.

Lithuanian distinguishes two accent paradigms of these nominals, depending on whether the root was acuted, as in the fixed paradigm, or not.
* If the root was acuted, it is said to belong to ''third accent paradigm''.
* If the root was not acuted, then, by the operation of de Saussure's law, the accent shifted onto all the acuted endings in the paradigm, and these nouns are accounted as belonging to the ''fourth accent paradigm''.

In Proto-Slavic, the operation of [[Meillet's law]] converted acute roots to circumflexed in mobile nominals, so that the split found in Lithuanian does not occur. All nominals with mobile accentuation in Balto-Slavic belong to one accent paradigm in Slavic, ''accent paradigm C''.

* Lithuanian has preserved the best Balto-Slavic mobile paradigm.
* The Proto-Slavic initial accent is preserved as a circumflex by [[Meillet's law]].
* In Neoštokavian, the final accent has been retracted and gained rising intonation.
* In Slovene, several advancings and retractions of the accent have occurred so it no longer reflects the original position as neatly. All non-accented vowels were shortened, and all non-final accented vowels were lengthened.

==Post-Balto-Slavic developments==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
In the later Balto-Slavic languages, the acute articulation itself was often lost, leaving only the pitch distinction on accented syllables as the reflex. There, "acute" is only a type of pitch accent, rather than a specific articulatory feature. The Slavic languages have no trace of the acute articulation and preserve only tonal distinctions although most have since lost even those, in their development from Proto-Slavic. The East Baltic languages preserve some traces of the original acute articulation, in the form of the so-called "broken tone", the is a long vowel with a glottal stop in the middle of it, typically denoted by a circumflex diacritic, not to be confused with the circumflex accent: ''â'' {{IPA|[aˀa]}}. The broken tone is preserved in syllables in certain dialects of Latvian and Lithuanian. The broken tone can occur on unaccented syllables so it is not actually a tone but a [[register (phonology)|register]] distinction, much like the [[Danish language|Danish]] ''[[stød]]'' or the ''ngã'' tone in Northern [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].

The short accent was preserved as such in both the Baltic and Slavic languages, but its lengthening could be triggered by certain conditions. For example, in Lithuanian, vowels /a/ and /e/ were lengthened when they initially bore short accent in open syllable, and rising tone emerged, marked with tilde sign ''ã''. Compare:
* PIE {{PIE|''*kʷékʷlo-''}} "circle, wheel" &gt; Balto-Slavic ''*kákla-'' &gt; Lithuanian ''[[wikt:kaklas#Lithuanian|kãklas]]'' "neck", Serbo-Croatian ''[[wikt:kolo#Serbo-Croatian|kȍlo]]''.
* PIE {{PIE|''*déḱm̥t''}} "ten" &gt; Balto-Slavic ''*déśimt'' &gt; Lithuanian ''[[wikt:dešimt#Lithuanian|dẽšimt]]'', Serbo-Croatian ''[[wikt:deset#Serbo-Croatian|dȅset]]''.

===Latvian===
The most direct continuation of the acute is in Latvian, particularly in the three-tone central dialects. There, the acute register is directly continued as a broken tone (''lauztā'') in originally unstressed syllables, marked with a circumflex diacritic: ''luôgs'' "window". In originally-stressed syllables, the acute register is continued as a rising or lengthened intonation (''stieptā''), marked with a [[tilde]]: ''luõks'' "spring onion". The circumflex register is generally continued as a falling intonation (''krītošā''), marked with a [[grave accent]]:  ''lùoks'' "arch, bow". It can occur on all syllables: [[locative]] plural ''gal̂vâs'' "on the heads" (compare: Lithuanian ''galvosè'' with stress on a short final vowel, deleted in Latvian), including monosyllables: ''dêt'' "to lay eggs" &lt; ''*dêtì''.&lt;ref name="derksen12"&gt;Derksen, Rick (2008). ''Etymological Dictionary of the Slavic Inherited Lexicon''. Leiden: Brill. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lithuanian===
In Lithuanian, the distinction between acute and circumflex is not preserved in unstressed syllables. In Standard Lithuanian, based on the [[Aukštaitian dialect]], the acute becomes a falling tone (so-called "Lithuanian metatony") and is marked with an [[acute accent]], and the circumflex becomes a rising tone, marked with a [[tilde]]. In diphthongs, the acute accent is placed on the first letter of the diphthong while the tilde marking rising tone (the original circumflex) is placed on the second letter. In diphthongs with a sonorant as a second part, the same convention is used, but the acute accent is replaced with a [[grave accent]]: Lithuanian ''[[wikt:pilnas#Lithuanian|pìlnas]]'' 'full' &lt; PIE {{PIE|*plh₁nos}}). Word-finally, the acute was regularly shortened: ''[[wikt:geras#Lithuanian|gerà]]'' 'good' (indefinite adjective) : ''geróji'' 'the good' (definite adjective). That rule is called '''Leskien's law''' after the German neogrammarian [[August Leskien]].

The shortening operated according to Leskien's law after the Lithuanian metatony. In monosyllabic words, the acute became circumflexed. Metatonical retraction of the accent from the final syllable to the penultimate syllable also created a circumflex automatically.

In the [[Žemaitian]] (Samogitian) dialects of Lithuanian, the usual reflex of Balto-Slavic acute in a stressed syllable is a broken tone like Latvian: Žemaitian (Kretinga) ''ộmž́iọs'' "age, century" = standard ''ámžius''.&lt;ref name="derksen12"/&gt;

===Old Prussian===
In Old Prussian, the acute was reflected probably as a rising tone and circumflex as a falling tone. The marks on long vowels and diphthongs in [[Abel Will]]'s translation of [[Martin Luther]]'s ''[[Erfurt Enchiridion|Enchiridion]]'' point to that conclusion. It is the only accented Old Prussian text preserved. Diphthongs that correspond to a reconstructable Balto-Slavic acute are generally long in the second part of the diphthong, and those corresponding to a Balto–Slavic circumflex are generally long in the first part.

===Slavic===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
{{main article|Proto-Slavic accent}}
In Proto-Slavic, the acute was lost as an articulatory feature and retained only as a tonal distinction on accented syllables. The acute produced a rising tone and the circumflex a falling tone, as in Latvian and Old Prussian.

Several developments in Late Common Slavic affected vowel length. Syllables that were originally short could lengthen, and those originally long could shorten. However, the long vowels also acquired different quality from the short ones so lengthenings and shortenings did not cause them to merge.

Instead, the vowels remained separate, causing the number of distinct vowels to almost double. Thus, differences vowel quality reflected older length distinctions while new vowel length distinctions were conditioned by accent type and placement. Consequently, in the Slavic languages that retain it, vowel length is often a [[suprasegmental]] feature tied to the accentual system rather phonemes. In Czech, Slovak and Old Polish, the mobile accent was lost in favour of fixed stress, which rephonemicised the older accentual length distinctions. Thus, the languages have long vowels as distinct phonemes, but they do not reflect the original Proto-Slavic length distinctions.

In all Slavic languages, the acute was shortened when it fell on a long vowel. A new rising accent (the "neoacute"), generally long, developed from retraction of the stress from a weak [[yer]] vowel (later usually lost). The short rising accent that developed from the old acute (and in some circumstances, the neoacute) was later lengthened again in a number of Slavic languages (such as Russian, Czech, Slovenian). The circumflex was shortened in some dialects as well (such as Polish, Russian, Czech, Slovak). Direct continuation of the acute vs. circumflex difference as a tonal distinction occurs only in archaic Serbo–Croatian dialects (such as [[Chakavian]]) and, to some extent, Slovenian (although the relationship between Slovenian and Proto-Slavic tones and accent position is complex).

In addition, the Proto-Slavic tonal distinction on liquid diphthongs is reflected fairly directly in Russian as a multisyllable accent shape ([[pleophony]]): *ôr (falling) &gt; ''óro'', *ór (rising) &gt; ''oró''. In some other languages (most notably Czech and standard [[Neoshtokavian]] Serbo-Croatian), the acute vs. circumflex distinction is continued as a length distinction (although in all languages, both long and short vowels have other sources as well). The length-from-tone distinction no longer exists in Russian.

Here is a table of basic accentual correspondences of the first syllable of a word:

==Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic==
Scholars raised questions regarding the possible relationship between Slavic and Baltic languages as early as the late-18th century. In 1802 the influential German scholar of Slavic languages and history [[August Ludwig von Schlözer]] described how his understanding of this relationship had changed over the years: whereas previously he had argued that the 'Latvian' or 'Old-Prussian' peoples spoke languages that belonged to the Slavic group, he had come to see them as an independent language family.&lt;ref&gt;Schlözer, August Ludwig, [Nestor in Russian] Russische Annalen in ihrer Slavonischen GrundSprache verglichen, übersetzt, und erklärt, vol.2: Rußlands VorGeschichte. Entstehung des russischen Stats. Erste GrosfËURST rurik, bis zu dessen Tod im J.879. Allgemeiner Plan, die russischen Annalen Kritisch zu behandeln.

It was formerly thought that Balto-Slavic split into two branches, Baltic and Slavic, which both developed as a single common language for some time afterwards. More recently, scholarship suggests that Baltic was not a single branch of Balto-Slavic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kortlandt |first=Frederik |author-link=Frederik Kortlandt |year=2009 |title=Baltica &amp; Balto-Slavica |page=5 |quote=Though Prussian is undoubtedly closer to the East Baltic languages than to Slavic, the characteristic features of the Baltic languages seem to be either retentions or results of parallel development and cultural interaction.

'''Proto-Esperanto''' ({{lang-eo|Pra-Esperanto}}) is the modern term for any of the stages in the evolution of [[L. L. Zamenhof]]'s [[Esperanto|language project]], prior to the publication of ''[[Unua Libro]]'' in 1887.

==The ''Lingwe uniwersala'' of 1878==
As a child, Zamenhof had the idea to introduce an [[international auxiliary language]] for communication between different nationalities. He originally wanted to revive some form of simplified [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]], but as he grew older he came to believe that it would be better to create a new language for his purpose. During his teenage years he worked on a language project until he thought it was ready for public demonstration. On December 17, 1878 (about one year before the first publication of [[Volapük language|Volapük]]), Zamenhof celebrated his 19th birthday and the birth of the language with some friends, who liked the project. Zamenhof himself called his language ''Lingwe Uniwersala'' (Universal Language).

''W'' is used for ''v''. Otherwise, all modern Esperanto letters are attested apart from ''ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, ŭ''. Known verb forms are present ''-á'', imperative ''-ó'', infinitive ''-are''.&lt;ref&gt;Zamenhof appears to have not distinguished acute and grave accents in his orthography (Kiselman 2010:53).&lt;/ref&gt; Nouns were marked by ''-e'' in the singular and ''-es'' in the plural; the article was singular ''la'' and plural ''las''. It appears that there was no accusative case, and that stress was as in modern Esperanto, except when marked, as in ''-á'' and ''-ó''.

Only four lines of the ''Lingwe uniwersala'' stage of the language from 1878 remain, from an early song that Zamenhof composed:

{| 
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Malamikete de las nacjes,||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||Enmity of nations,
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Kadó, kadó, jam temp' está&lt;!--Z used a grave accent, changed by Waringhien--&gt;;|| ||Fall, Fall, it is time!;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''La tot' homoze in familje|| ||All humanity in a family
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''Konunigare so debá.|| ||Must unite.
|}

In modern Esperanto, this would be,
:''Malamikeco de la nacioj,
:''Falu, falu, jam temp' estas;
:''La tuta homaro en familion
:''Unuiĝi&lt;!--Z's translation, later changed by Waringhien--&gt; [= kununuigi sin] devas.

''Jam temp' está'' remains an idiom in modern Esperanto, an allusion to this song.

==The ''Lingvo universala'' of 1881==
While at university, Zamenhof handed his work over to his father, Mordechai, for safe-keeping until he had completed his medical studies. His father, not understanding the ideas of his son and perhaps anticipating problems from the [[Okhranka|Tsarist police]], burned the work. Zamenhof did not discover this until he returned from university in 1881, at which point he restarted his project. A sample from this second phase of the language is this extract of a letter from 1881:

:''Ma plej kara [ami] miko, kvan ma plekulpa plumo faktidźas tiranno pu to. Mo poté de cen taj brivoj kluri, ke sciigoj de [tuc fuc] fu-ći specco debé[j] blessi tal fradral kordol; mo vel vidé tol jam ...''
Modern: ''Mia plej kara amiko, neniam mia senkulpa plumo fariĝus tirano por ci. Mi povas de cent ciaj leteroj konkludi, kiel sciigoj de tiu-ĉi speco devas vundi cian fratan koron; mi kvazaŭ vidas cin jam ...'' 
:(My dearest friend, never (lit. 'when') would my innocent pen become a tyrant for you. From a hundred of your letters I can conclude that announcements of this kind must wound your brotherly heart; I [can] already see you thus...)

By this time the letter ''v'' had replaced ''w'' for the [v] sound; verbal inflection for person and number had been dropped; the nominal plural was ''-oj'' in place of ''-es'' (as well as adjectival ''-a'' and adverbial ''-e''); and the noun cases were down to the current two (though a genitive ''-es'' survives today in the correlatives). The accusative case suffix was ''-l'', but in many cases was only used on pronouns: 
:''Fu'''l'''-ći rudźo e fu'''l'''-ći fiaro debá kini la princaŭ'' (Tiu'''n'''-ĉi rozo'''n''' kaj tiu'''n'''-ĉi najtingalo'''n''' devadis ricevi la princino) 'The princess needed to receive this rose and this nightingale'.

Beside the stronger Slavic flavor of the orthography (''ć, dź, h́, ś, ź'' for ''ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ŝ, ĵ'') compared to the modern language, the imperfective verb forms (present and imperfect) still had final stress:
: present tense ''-è'', [[imperfect]] ''-à'', [[preterite]] ''-u'', future ''-uj'', conditional ''-as'', jussive ''-ó'', and infinitive ''-i''.

The pronouns ended in a nominal ''o'' (or adjectival ''a'' for possessives: ''mo'' "I", ''ma'' "my"), but there were other differences as well, including a conflation of 'he' and 'it': 

:{| class=wikitable
!'''1881 pronouns'''||singular||plural
|-
|style="text-align:left;"|1st person||''mo''||''no''
|-
|style="text-align:left;"|2nd person||''to''||''vo''
|-
|style="text-align:left;"|3rd masc./neut.||''ro''||rowspan=2|''po''
|-
|style="text-align:left;"|3rd feminine||''śo''
|-
|style="text-align:left;"|3rd reflexive||colspan=2|''so''
|}
In addition, there was indefinite ''o'' 'one'.

The correlatives were similarly close, though it is not clear if there was a distinction between indefinite and relative forms (modern ''i-'' and ''ki-''; these may have corresponded to ''kv-'' and ''k-'') and no possessive forms are known:

:{| class="wikitable"
! ||-o||-u||-a||-e||-al||-el||-am||-om
|-
|'''ti-''' ||fo ||fu ||fa ||fi ||fej ||fe ||fan|| 
|-
|'''ki- / i-''' ||kvo, &lt;br&gt;ko ||kvu, &lt;br&gt;ku ||kva&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; || || ||kve, &lt;br&gt;ke ||kvan, &lt;br&gt;kan|| &lt;br&gt;kom
|-
|'''ĉi-''' ||ćio ||ćiu || ||ćii || || ||ćian || 
|-
|'''neni-''' ||fio ||fiu || || || || ||fian || 
|}
The last row was evidently pronounced as ''fj-''. 

Esperanto at this stage had a consonantal [[ablaut]] in verbs, with a voiceless consonant for an attempt at something, and a voiced consonant for success. For example, ''aŭti'' to listen (for), ''aŭdi'' to hear; ''trofi'' to look for, ''trovi'' to find; ''prufi'' to argue (a point), ''pruvi'' to prove. Traces of this remain in a few pairs of words such as ''pesi'' 'to weigh (an item)' and ''pezi'' 'to weigh (have weight)' (cf. their derivatives ''pesilo'' 'scales' &amp; ''pezilo'' 'a weight').&lt;ref&gt;Kiselman (2010:64–65)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition to the modern Esperanto of 1887==
Zamenhof refined his ideas for the language for the next several years. Most of his refinements came through translation of literature and poetry in other languages. The final stress in the verb conjugations was rejected in favour of always stressing the second-last vowel, and the old plural ''-s'' on nouns became a marker of finite tenses on verbs, with an imperfect ''-es'' remaining until just before publication. The Slavic-style acute diacritics became [[circumflex]]es to avoid overt appearances of nationalism, and the new bases of the letters ''ĵ, ĝ'' (for former ''ź, dź)'' helped preserve the appearance of Romance and Germanic vocabulary.

In 1887 Zamenhof finalized his tinkering with the publication of the ''[[Unua Libro]]'' (''First Book''), which contained the [[Esperanto]] language as we know it today. In a letter to [[Nikolai Borovko]] he later wrote,
{{Quote|I've worked for six years perfecting and testing the language, when in the year 1878 it had already seemed completely ready to me.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}|Zamenhof}}

'''Raghunath Vishnu Pandit''' (1916 or 1917-1990)&lt;ref&gt;1916 is given by Sisir Kumar Das, ''History of Indian Literature 1911-1956. Struggle for Freedom: Triumph and Tragedy'' (New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi, 1995), p. 514; 1917 by WorldCat Identities, http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n81-58726/.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Goa]]n poet. He is best known and most celebrated for his vast poetic production in [[Konkani language|Konkani]]. Pandit also produced a significant body of work in Portuguese after the Liberation of Goa in 1961, and also wrote in Marathi. Much of his output was written in a neo-realist style demonstrating a marked concern for the downtrodden sections of Goan society. Among his most noted achievements are the publication of five books of poetry on one day (26 January 1963) and a prize from the [[Sahitya Akademi]] for his 1975 ''Dariā Gāzotā''.&lt;ref&gt;Sisir Kumar Das, ''History of Indian Literature 1911-1956. Struggle for Freedom: Triumph and Tragedy'' (New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi, 1995), p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

A monograph on Poet Raghunath Vishnu Pandit has been written by [[S. M. Tadkodkar|Dr. S. M. Tadkodkar]], a Konkani-Marathi poet, research scholar and Reader, Head of Department of Marathi [[Goa University]]. It was published by Goa Government's [[Goa Konkani Akademy]], in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Tadkodkar, '' R V Pandit: Jiveet Aane Waawar'' (Panaji: Goa Konkani Akademi, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

When intercepted by the British, this raw intelligence required decryption, translation and confirmation and then was still just part of the overall case made for [[American entry into World War I|US entry into the conflict]].&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;]]  
'''Raw intelligence''' is [[raw data]] gathered by an intelligence operation, such as [[espionage]] or [[signal interception]].  Such data commonly requires processing and analysis to make it useful and reliable.  To turn the raw intelligence into a finished form, the steps required may include [[decryption]], [[translation]], [[collation]], [[evaluation]] and [[Fact checking|confirmation]].&lt;ref name=FBI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Phythian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oseth/&gt;

In the period after the [[First World War]],  British practise was to circulate raw intelligence with little analysis or context.&lt;ref name=Jeffery/&gt;  Such direct intelligence was a strong influence on policy-makers.&lt;ref name=Jeffery/&gt;  [[Churchill]] was especially keen to see raw intelligence and was supplied this by [[Desmond Morton (civil servant)|Desmond Morton]] during his period outside the government.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;  When Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940, he still insisted on receiving raw intelligence and wanted it all until it was explained that the volume was now too great.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;  A selection of daily intercepts was provided to him each day by [[Bletchley Park]] and he called these his "golden eggs".&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;

US intelligence has a different tradition from the British.  The key event for the US was the failure to prevent the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the inquiries which followed concluded that this was not due to the lack of raw intelligence so much as the failure to make effective use of it.  The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] was created to collate, analyse and summarise the raw intelligence collected by the other departments.  US agencies which focus on the collection of raw intelligence include the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] and the [[National Security Agency]].&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;

'''Rivka Keren''' (born July 24, 1946) is an Israeli writer.

==Biography==
Rivka Keren was born as Katalin Friedländer in [[Debrecen]], [[Hungary]]. She [[Immigration|immigrated]] with her parents and small brother to [[Israel]] in 1957. She has been writing since childhood, first in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], later in [[Hebrew]]. Studied [[painting]] in [[Jerusalem]] and [[New York City]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]] and [[psychology]] in [[Bar Ilan University]], graduated in [[Tel Aviv University]] ([[Master of Arts|MA]], [[clinical psychology]]).
Keren has worked as a [[librarian]], [[art therapist]] and clinical psychologist. Exhibited her paintings in various countries. During these years, she had published books for children, adolescents, novels, short stories, translations and was included in numerous [[Anthology|anthologies]]. Some of her books and short stories had been translated to German, English, Spanish, [[Russian language|Russian]], Hungarian, [[Braille]] (for the blind) and recorded on disks.
Keren is a member of [[International PEN|PEN]], [[Society of Authors, Composers and Music Publishers in Israel|ACUM]], and IPA.

She is married with two children.

==Literary work==
Rivka Keren published so far fourteen books and four additional books are due to be published soon. Her work is dealing mostly with subject matters such as [[destiny]], [[memory]], [[Identity (social science)|identity]], the mystery of love and evil and the dualism of [[immigrants]]. Keren's writing is multi-layered and non-linear. The characters wander in a limbo between good and bad, love and hate, sanity and madness, while their state of mind meticulously analyzed. Their quests for belonging, roots and most of all truth and purpose, carry them to their goals through suffering and harsh experiences. Those of the novels that examine the characters against the black hole of the [[Holocaust]] were [[bestseller]]s and subject to much controversy among critics. In her writings, Rivka Keren, as second generation to [[Holocaust survivors]], is representing the ongoing turmoil and conflict in the existence of immigrants, their pain and alienation but also their absorption and success. Her novels are a study of the human nature, the destructiveness of evil and revenge and the power of hope and love.

A '''spoken language''' is a [[language]] produced  by articulate sounds, as opposed to a [[written language]]. Many languages have no written form and so are only spoken. An '''oral language''' or '''vocal language''' is a language produced with the vocal tract, as opposed to a [[sign language]], which is produced with the hands and face. The term "spoken language" is sometimes used to mean only vocal languages, especially by linguists, making all three terms synonyms by excluding sign languages. Others refer to sign language as "spoken", especially in contrast to written transcriptions of signs.&lt;ref&gt;Nora Groce (1985) ''Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language: Hereditary Deafness on Martha's Vineyard''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry Hoemann (1986) ''Introduction to American sign language''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks &amp; Kempe (2012) ''Language Development''&lt;/ref&gt;

In spoken language, much of the meaning is determined by the context. That contrasts with written language in which more of the meaning is provided directly by the text. In spoken language, the truth of a proposition is determined by common-sense reference to experience, but in written language, a greater emphasis is placed on logical and coherent argument. Similarly, spoken language tends to convey subjective information, including the relationship between the speaker and the audience, whereas written language tends to convey objective information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|title=Spoken and written language: exploring orality and literacy|year=1982|publisher=ABLEX Pub. Corp.|location=Norwood, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between spoken language and written language is complex. Within the field of [[linguistics]] the current consensus is that speech is an innate human capability, and written language is a cultural invention.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S., &amp; Bloom, P. (1990). Natural language and natural selection. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 13, 707–784.&lt;/ref&gt; However some linguists, such as those of the [[Prague school (linguistics)|Prague school]], argue that written and spoken language possess distinct qualities which would argue against written language being dependent on spoken language for its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron, P. G., &amp; Joshi, R. M. (2006). Written language is as natural as spoken language: A biolinguistic perspective. ''Reading Psychology'', 27(4), 263–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both vocal and sign languages are composed of [[word]]s. In vocal languages, words are made up from a limited set of [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], and often [[tone (phonology)|tone]]. In sign languages, words are made up from a limited set of shapes, orientations, locations movements of the hands, and often facial expressions; in both cases, the building blocks are called [[phoneme]]s. In both vocal and sign languages, words are [[grammar|grammatically]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodically]] linked into [[phrase (grammar)|phrase]]s, [[clause (grammar)|clause]]s, and larger units of [[discourse]].

Hearing children acquire as their [[first language]] the language that is used around them, whether vocal, cued (if they are sighted) signed. Deaf children can do the same with Cued Speech or sign language if either visual communication system is used around them. Vocal language are traditionally taught to them in the same way that written language must be taught to hearing children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1539">The term '''taskscape''' is often credited to [[social anthropology|social anthropologist]] [[Tim Ingold]]. As Ingold has described the term: "just as the [[landscape]] is an array of related features, so – by analogy – the taskscape is an array of related activities." Taskscape, then is a socially constructed space of human activity, understood as having spatial boundaries and delimitations for the purposes of analysis. Of key importance, is that ''taskscape'' as well as ''landscape'', is to be considered as perpetually in process rather than in a static or otherwise immutable state. A taskscape is typically analyzed via five factors: mobility, habitat, economy, nature, and public space.

Tim Ingold coined the term in his 1993 article&lt;ref&gt;Ingold, Tim. (1993) "The Temporality of the Landscape", ''World Archaeology'', 25(2): pp. 152-174&lt;/ref&gt; defining the spatial and temporal dimensions of the landscape in human life. He considers it as a methodological structure and analyses the temporality of the landscape in [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel's]] famous painting, ''[[The Harvesters (painting)|The Harvesters]]''.

'''Yuzhne''' ({{lang-uk|Ю́жне}}, formerly: Южний, ''Yuzhny'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuzhny.org/ Official site of the city]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yuzhny.in.ua/ Information portal of Yuzhny '''Yuzhny on-line''']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuzhny.net/ Telefon directory of Yuzhny]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allyuzhny.com/ Description, news, catalog of enterprises of Yuzhny]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuzhny.com/ Internet portal of Yuzhny] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731121420/http://www.yuzhny.com/ |date=31 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; translated as "southern" [[grammatical gender|n.]] [[adjective|adj.]]) is a port [[city]] in [[Odessa Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]) of south-western [[Ukraine]]. Administratively, Yuzhne is incorporated as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|town of oblast significance]]. It is situated on the country's [[Black Sea]] coast. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2015|32,003}}

Initially created as a settlement of the Odessa Portside Plant in the Hryhorivka Estuary, since 1981 it was transformed into a suburb of Odessa within the Suvorovsky District of the city. From the Southern Marine Terminal of the city port, the [[Odessa–Brody pipeline]] takes its beginning towards the [[Western Ukraine]].

The city's port is an internationally important oil [[Container terminal|terminal]], and one of Ukraine's top three ports, with [[Odessa]] and [[Chornomorsk]]. In fact, these three nearby port cities have grown into a single [[conurbation]], and Yuzhne is considered a satellite of Odessa.

== Name ==
The city is located about 32 kilometers (20 miles) east of [[Odessa]]. Although it sounds awkwardly in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], the city's name has not changed since [[Ukraine]] obtained its independence. The correct way to name the town in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is ''Pivdenne'', rather than ''Yuzhne''.
[[File:Olimp Sports Complex in Yuzhne.jpg|thumb|left|Olimp Sports Complex in Yuzhne]]
Nonetheless, on 11 May 1978 by the order of the Presidium of [[Verkhovna Rada]] of [[Ukrainian SSR]] the newly built populated place was given the name of the village Yuzhne. Starting from this event the place takes its beginning. In February 1993 the [[Verkhovna Rada]] of [[Ukraine]] declared to give the urbanized village a special status in the [[Odessa Oblast]] as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]]. In 2000 the declaration of [[Verkhovna Rada]] #1914-III confirmed the city limits.

== Climate ==
Yuzhne has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa'').
