The '''''Annales Beneventani''''' ("Beneventan Annals"), also called the '''''Breve chronicon monasterii Sanctae Sophiae Beneventi''''' ("Brief Chronicle of the Monastery of Santa Sofia of Benevento") or '''''Chronicon Sanctae Sophiae''''' for short, is a series of [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] [[annals]] from the [[Santa Sofia, Benevento|monastery of Santa Sofia]] in [[Benevento]], southern Italy. The annal entries were originally annotations written in the margins of [[Paschal table]]s, a practice that probably dates to the foundation of the monastery in the second half of the eighth century. The annotations were gathered together and copied into manuscripts in the early twelfth century. Three such manuscripts exist, each copied at Santa Sofia and each presenting a different [[redaction]] of the annals.&lt;ref name=Kujawinski&gt;Jakub Kujawinski, [https://www.academia.edu/7344337/Annales_Beneventani "Annales Beneventani"], in R. G. Dunphy, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle'' (Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2010), 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annales'' is of interest primarily because its entries are roughly contemporaneous with the events they describe.&lt;ref name=Blumenthal&gt;Uta-Renate Blumenthal, ''The Early Councils of Pope Paschal II, 1100–1110'' (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1978), p. 8, n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Version A.1 in manuscript [[Vatican Library|Vatican, BAV]], vat. lat. 4928, fol. 1&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;–8&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;, copied between 1113 and 1118, covers the years 787–1113. Version A.2 in manuscript Vatican BAV, vat. lat. 4939, fol. 1&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;–15&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;, copied in 1119, has entries added for the years before 787 all the way back to the [[birth of Jesus]]; it also has entries for the years down to 1128. It is found in the same manuscript as the monastery's [[cartulary]], a collection of [[canon law]] and a list of the [[Princes of Benevento]]. Version A.3 in manuscript [[Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III|Naples, BN]], VI E 43, fol. 17&lt;small&gt;r&lt;/small&gt;–18&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;, copied between 1107 and 1118, has entries for the years from 1096 to 1130. It is the only version in which the annals are marginal annotations to a Paschal table, which would have been the form of the original manuscript(s) from which all three surviving redactions are derived.&lt;ref name=Kujawinski/&gt; A fourth redaction once accepted as genuine has been identified as an eighteenth-century forgery. Ottorino Bertolini made the [[Editio princeps|first critical edition]] based on all three texts in 1923.&lt;ref name=Blumenthal/&gt;

The ''Annales'' have a distinctly Beneventan and south Italian perspective. The succession of [[Byzantine emperors]] is recorded into the ninth century, while the neither the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] nor the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] emperors are recognised as such, being referred to only as "kings". The succession of Princes of Benevento is recorded down to the end the principality around 1050, when the city came under papal rule. Thereafter, the ''Annales'' record the succession of [[List of popes|popes]]. The entries are more detailed from the tenth century onwards, but few are about the monastery itself.&lt;ref name=Kujawinski/&gt;

It's a standards-based access management system, written in Java, that provides role-based access control, delegated administration and password policy services with [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]].

Standards implemented:
* [[Role-based access control|Role-Based Access Control]] (ANSI INCITS 359)
* Administrative Role-Based Access Control (ARBAC02)
* IETF [[Password policy|Password Policy]] (draft)
*Unix Users and Groups (RFC2307)
  
Fortress has four separate components:
* Core - Java Access Management SDK
* Realm - [[Web container|Web Container]] security for [[Apache Tomcat]]
* Rest - HTTP protocol wrappers for the APIs
* Web - HTML pages for the APIs

==History==
Fortress was first contributed in 2011 to the OpenLDAP Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Request for Contribution of Identity Access Management Software to OpenLDAP Project |url=http://www.openldap.org/its/index.cgi/Contrib?id=6995;expression=fortress;statetype=-1#themesg

In [[web archiving]], an '''archive site''' is a [[website]] that stores information on webpages from the past for anyone to view.

==Common techniques==
Two common techniques for archiving web sites are using a [[web crawler]] or soliciting user submissions:

# '''Using a [[web crawler]]''': By using a web crawler (e.g., the [[Internet Archive]]) the service will not depend on an active community for its content, and thereby can build a larger database faster. However, web crawlers are only able to index and archive information the public has chosen to post to the Internet, or that is available to be crawled, as web site developers and system administrators have the ability to block web crawlers from accessing [certain] web pages (using a [[Robots Exclusion Standard|robots.txt]]).
# '''User submissions''': While it can be difficult to start user submissions services due to potentially low rates of user submission, this system can yield some of the best results. By crawling web pages one is only able to obtain the information the public has chosen to post online; however, potential content providers may not bother to post certain information, assuming no one would be interested in it, because they lack a proper venue in which to post it, or because of copyright concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dlib.org/dlib/march12/niu/03niu1.html|journal=D-Lib Magazine| date=March–April 2012 |
 volume =18| number =3/4| title=An Overview of Web Archiving |author=Jinfang Niu,  University of South Florida|doi=10.1045/march2012-niu1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, users who see someone wants their information may be more apt to submit it.

==Examples==

===Google Groups===
On February 12, 2001, [[Google]] acquired the [[usenet]] discussion group archives from [[Deja.com]] and turned it into their [[Google Groups]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Acquires Usenet Discussion Service and Significant Assets from Deja.com |work= |date=February 12, 2001 |url=https://googlepress.blogspot.com/2001/02/google-acquires-usenet-discussion.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow users to search old discussions with Google's search technology, while still allowing users to post to the [[mailing list]]s.

===Internet Archive===
The [[Internet Archive]] is building a compendium of websites and [[digital media]]. Starting in 1996, the Archive has been employing a web crawler to build up their database. It is one of the best known archive sites.

===NBCUniversal Archives===
[[NBCUniversal Archives]] offer access to exclusive content from [[NBCUniversal]] and its subsidiaries. Their NBCUniversal Archives website provides easy viewing of past and recent news clips, and it is a prime example of a news archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcuniversalarchives.com/nbcuni/home.do NBCUniversal Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nextpoint===
[[Nextpoint]] offers an automated [[Cloud computing|cloud]]-based, [[Software as a service|SaaS]] for marketing, compliance, and litigation related needs including electronic discovery.

===PANDORA Archive===
PANDORA ([[Pandora Archive]]), founded in 1996 by the National Library of [[Australia]], stands for Preserving and Accessing Networked Documentary Resources of Australia, which encapsulates their mission. They provide a long-term catalog of select online publications and web sites authored by Australians or that are of an Australian topic. They employ their PANDAS (PANDORA Digital Archiving System) when building their catalog.

===textfiles.com===
[[textfiles.com]] is a large library of old text files maintained by [[Jason Scott Sadofsky]]. Its mission is to archive the old documents that had floated around the [[bulletin board systems]] (BBS) of his youth and to document other people's experiences on the bulletin board systems.

{{CourtsEnglandWales}}
'''Barristers in England and Wales''' are one of the two main categories of [[lawyer]] in [[England and Wales]], the other being [[solicitor]]s. [[Barrister]]s have traditionally had the role of handling cases for representation in court, both defence and prosecution. (The word 'lawyer' is a generic one, referring to a person who practises in law, which could also be deemed to include other legal practitioners such as chartered legal executives.)

==Origin of the profession==
The work of senior legal professionals in [[England and Wales]] is divided between solicitors and [[barrister]]s. Both are trained in law but serve differing functions in the [[practice of law]].

Historically, the superior courts were based in London, the capital city. To dispense justice throughout the country, a judge and court personnel would periodically travel a regional circuit to deal with cases that had arisen there. From this developed a body of lawyers who were on socially familiar terms with the judges, had training and experience in the superior courts, and had access to a greater corpus of research material and accumulated knowledge on the interpretation and application of the law. Some would go "on circuit" with the court to act on behalf of those requiring representation. By contrast, solicitors were essentially local to one place, whether London or a provincial town.

Lawyers who practised in the courts in this way came to be called "barristers" because they were "called to the Bar", the symbolic barrier separating the public—including solicitors and law students—from those admitted to the well of the Court. They became specialists either in appearing in court to represent clients, or in the process of using the courts, which would include giving oral or written advice on the strength of a case and the best way to conduct it. For those who had the means and preference to engage a solicitor, it became useful, then normal and then compulsory, for the solicitor in turn to select and engage a barrister to represent the client before the courts. Likewise, it became either useful or normal (but not compulsory) to engage an appropriate barrister when highly specialist advice was required. Many barristers have largely "paper practices" and rarely or (in some cases) never make court appearances.

Historically, practising at the bar (or in court) was a more socially prestigious profession than working as a solicitor. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the bar was one of the limited number of professions considered suitable for upper class men; politics, the Army and Navy, the established clergy, and the civil and diplomatic services being the others. Many leading eighteenth and nineteenth-century politicians were barristers; few were solicitors. In the 20th century, solicitors closed the gap greatly, especially in terms of earnings, and by the early 21st century the social gap was far less important than formerly.

== Key differences from the profession of solicitor ==
Until recently, the most obvious differences between the two professions was that, firstly, only barristers had exclusive and wide [[rights of audience]] (that is, a right to plead) in all courts in England and Wales, and secondly, only solicitors could be directly engaged by clients for payment. These differences have been eroded by recent deliberate changes, although in many fields of legal practice, the distinction is largely retained in practice.

Barristers have full rights of audience to appear in all courts, from highest to lowest. Solicitors, on the other hand, have traditionally been able to appear only as advocates in the lower courts (that is, the magistrates' and county courts) and [[tribunal]]s. The bulk of such work continues to be handled by solicitors. Under section 17 of the [[Courts and Legal Services Act 1990]], solicitors with appropriate advocacy experience are entitled to acquire higher "rights of audience", enabling them to appear in the superior courts. Solicitors who attain these rights are known as [[solicitor-advocates]]. But, in practice the number of [[solicitor-advocates]] exercising their right to do so remains fairly small, and solicitors often continue to engage a barrister to undertake any required advocacy in court. Not only is this division traditional; in higher-value civil or more serious criminal cases, it is often tactically imperative to engage a specialist advocate (because if one side does not the other might).

Until 2004, barristers were prohibited from seeking or accepting "instructions" (that is, being hired) directly by the clients whom they represent. The involvement of a solicitor was compulsory. The rationale was that solicitors could investigate and gather [[evidence (law)|evidence]] and instructions and filter them – according to the interests of the client – before presenting them to the barrister; in return the barrister, being one step removed from the client, could reach a more objective opinion of the merits of the case, working strictly from the evidence that would be admissible in court. In addition, being less involved in the current affairs of clients, including many matters that might never come to court, barristers had more time for research and for keeping up to date with the law and the decisions ([[precedent]]) of the courts.

Theoretically, this prohibition has been removed. In certain areas (but not crime or [[conveyancing]]), barristers may now accept instructions from a client directly ("Direct Access"). Only a solicitor, however, may undertake any work that requires funds to be held on behalf of a client.

A barrister is in principle required to act for any client offering a proper fee, regardless of the attractions or disadvantages of a case and the personal feelings of the barrister towards the client. This is known as the "[[cab-rank rule]]", since the same rule applies to licensed taxi-cabs. Modifying conditions include that the barrister is available to take the case and feels competent to handle the work. A barrister who specialises in, for example, crime is not obliged to take on employment law work if he is offered it. He is entitled (and, even, obliged) to reject a case which he feels is too complicated for him to deal with properly.

==Manner of work==
Barristers work in two main contexts: in self-employed practice (formerly known as "independent practice") or in "employed" practice (i.e. salaried).

Most barristers are in self-employed practice, but operate within the framework of a set of Chambers. Under a tenancy agreement, they pay a certain amount per month ("rent") or a percentage of their incomes, or a mixture of the two, to their chambers, which provides accommodation and clerical support (including the crucial function of booking, and sometimes of finding, work).  The Head of Chambers, usually a [[Queen's Counsel]] (also referred to as "QC" or "Silk") or a "senior junior", may exercise a powerful influence on the members, and members often offer informal help and guidance to each other. They are not liable for each other's business (as partners are). Members of the same set of chambers may appear on opposite sides in the same case. Each barrister remains an independent practitioner, being solely responsible for the conduct of his own practice and keeping what he earns. He does not receive a salary from anyone. A barrister in independent practice will be instructed by a number of different solicitors ("professional clients") to act for various individuals, government departments, agencies or companies ("lay clients").

By contrast, an "employed" barrister is a barrister who works as an employee within a larger organisation, either in the public or private sector. For example, employed barristers work within government departments or agencies (such as the [[Crown Prosecution Service]]), the legal departments of companies, and in some cases for firms of solicitors. Employed barristers will typically be paid a salary, and in most circumstances may do work only on behalf of their employer, rather than accepting instructions on behalf of third parties (such as their employers' customers). They remain subject to the [[Bar Council]]'s Code of Professional Conduct, and their advice is entitled to professional privilege against disclosure.

New entrants to the employed bar must have completed [[pupillage]] in the same way as those in independent practice. The Bar Council produces exhaustive guidance regulating the way in which both groups operate, although in 2006 some of the regulatory authority was passed over to the independent Bar Standards Board.

In 2011 there were around 12,000 barristers in independent practice,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/Articles/197 Solicitor or barrister?]&lt;/ref&gt; of which about ten per cent were [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]. A further group (about 3,300)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/Articles/197 Solicitor or barrister?]&lt;/ref&gt; were employed in companies as ‘in-house’ counsel, or by local or national government, or in academic institutions.

=== Appearance and forms of address ===
The appearance and form of address of a barrister is bound by a number of conventions.

A barrister's appearance in court depends on whether the hearing is "robed" or not. In England and Wales, criminal cases in the Crown Court are almost invariably conducted with the barristers' wearing robes, but there is an increasing tendency in civil cases to dispense with them. The vast majority of County Court hearings are now conducted without robes, although the traditional attire continues to be worn in High Court proceedings.

At a robed hearing, barristers wear a horsehair [[Wig (hair)|wig]], an open black [[gown]], dark suit and a shirt, with strips of white cotton called 'bands' or 'tabs' worn over a winged collar, instead of a tie. Female barristers wear either the same shirt, or a special collar which includes the bands and tucks inside a suit jacket. QCs wear slightly different silk gowns over short embroidered black jackets and striped trousers. Solicitors wear a black gown (of a distinct style), wing collar and band and a wig. The question of barristers' and judges' clothing in the civil courts was the subject of review, and there is some pressure to adopt a more "modern" style of dress, with European-style gowns worn over lounge suits. Guidance from the Bar Council has resulted in robes being worn for trials and appeals in the County Court more than formerly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/media/58802/court_dress_020609.pdf "Court Dress: Revised Guidance"], Bar Council&lt;/ref&gt;

In court, barristers refer to each other as "my learned friend".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/media/342215/rivlin_report_final__march_2015_.pdf], Criminal Justice, Advocacy and the Bar at § 1.8&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to an opponent who is a solicitor, the term used is "my friend" – irrespective of the relative ages and experiences of the two. 

In an earlier generation, barristers would not shake hands or address each other formally. The rule against shaking hands is no longer generally observed, though the rule regarding formal address is still sometimes observed: at Gray's Inn, when toasting other barristers, a barrister will address another only by surname, without using a prefix such as 'Miss'.

== Regulation ==
Beginning in January 2006, standards for admission to the bar and disciplinary proceedings are administered by the [[Bar Standards Board]] (BSB), a regulatory board of the [[General Council of the Bar]]. The BSB is not legally separate from the General Council of the Bar, but is set up so as to be independent of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/ The Bar Standards Board&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, barristers were governed by the General Council of the Bar and the individual [[Inns of Court]]. There are four Inns, all situated in the area of London close to the [[Royal Courts of Justice|Law Courts]] in the [[Strand, London|Strand]]. [[Gray's Inn]] is off [[High Holborn]], [[Lincoln's Inn]] off [[Chancery Lane]], the [[Middle Temple|Middle]] and [[Inner Temple]]s, situated between [[Fleet Street]] and the [[Thames Embankment|Embankment]].

The Inns provide a social and professional hub where barristers and jurists can meet. They comprise a grand hall where barristers dine and attend social functions, and include an extensive library. Several rooms are available for conferences, and a place for trainee barristers to engage in advocacy practice. Two of the Inns have chapels, and Middle Temple and Inner Temple share Temple Church. All four Inns are set in well-tended gardens, and are surrounded by chambers often organised in courtyards and squares.

== Direct public access to barristers ==
Members of the public may engage the services of the barrister directly under the [[Public Access Scheme]]; a solicitor is not involved at any stage.

Barristers undertaking public access work can provide legal advice and representation in court in all areas of law (see the [https://web.archive.org/web/20121014160147/http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/instructing-a-barrister/public-access Public Access Information on the Bar Council website]) and are entitled to represent clients in any court or tribunal in England and Wales. Once instructions from a client are accepted, it is the barrister (rather than the solicitor) who advises and guides the client through the relevant legal procedure or litigation.

Before a barrister can undertake Public Access work, he or she must have completed a special course. At present, about 1 in 20 barristers has so qualified. 'Licensed Access' is a separate scheme available to certain nominated classes of professional client; it is not open to the general public.

It is an early 21st-century development to enable barristers to accept instructions directly from clients; it results from a change in the rules set down by the General Council of the Bar in July 2004. The [[Public Access Scheme]] has been introduced as part of a larger effort to open up the legal system to the public, and to make it easier and cheaper for individuals to obtain access to legal advice. It reduces the distinction between solicitors and barristers. The distinction remains, however, because a solicitor's role has certain aspects which a barrister is not able to undertake.

== Education and training ==
A prospective barrister must first complete the academic stage of their legal education by obtaining a qualifying law [[academic degree|degree]]. In lieu of a formal law degree, however, the individual may undertake a one-year law conversion course, formerly known as the CPE ([[Common Professional Examination]]) or PGDL (Postgraduate Diploma in Law), and now known simply as a GDL (Graduate Diploma in Law), having initially graduated in a subject other than law. The student joins one of the Inns of Court and takes the [[Bar Professional Training Course]] (BPTC) at one of the accredited providers.

It is still mandatory to "keep terms" before the student can be [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]]. The student must participate in 12 qualifying sessions, which may include dining in the Hall of the Inn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/Articles/217 The Inns of Court], Chambers Student&lt;/ref&gt; It used to be a prerequisite that 24 dinners were eaten before call, but the number has since been reduced to twelve. Dining credits are available for participating in specified training events (e.g., a weekend at Cumberland Lodge organised by one of the Inns credits attendees with three dinners). It is also possible to "double-dine" on various special occasions, by which the student is credited with two sessions.

The origins of this date from the time when both students and practitioners dined together; students learned elements of their education from their fellow diners and from readings given by a senior member of the Inn (Master Reader) after the meal. Generally, in order for the dinner to count towards the 12 required, the student must remain seated until after coffee has been served. Often moots (legal [[debate]]s arguing for or against a point before a notional [[appellate court]]) are held in hall afterwards. At the successful completion of the BPTC (where continuous assessment as well as examinations are now the rule), and completion of the requisite number of dining nights, students are entitled, subject to various formalities, to be "called to the Bar" at a ceremony in their Inn. This is conducted by the Masters of the Bench, or [[Bencher]]s, who are generally senior practising barristers or judges.

Once called to the bar, the new barrister has a choice whether or not to pursue a career in practice. As there are far more applicants for "tenancy" in barristers' "Chambers" (see below) than there are places, many barristers are unable to obtain a tenancy and choose to go into commercial or academic work. Those choosing not to practice continue to be recognised as 'barristers', although may not provide legal services under this label, and remain subject to some limited regulation by the Bar Standards Board.&lt;ref&gt; Mason, M. (2014). "UK: Room at the Inns—The Increased Scope of Regulation under the New Bar Standards Board Handbook for England and Wales", ''Legal Ethics'', 17(1) 143 [https://dx.doi.org/10.5235/1460728X.17.1.143] &lt;/ref&gt; 

One who wishes to become a practising barrister must first obtain a "[[pupillage]]". This is a competitive process which involves some 4,000 students applying for some 300 places each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barstandardsboard.org.uk/assets/documents/BVC%20Report%20with%20annexes.pdf "Pupillage"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Bar Standards Board&lt;/ref&gt; The online pupillage application system, Pupillage Portal (formerly known as [[OLPAS]]), enables applicants to submit their details to up to 12 barristers' chambers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chambersstudent.co.uk/Articles/216 "A career at the Bar"], Chambers Student&lt;/ref&gt; The Pupillage Portal system is used by most chambers to recruit their pupils; many, however, do not, and such chambers must be contacted directly by applicants. There is no limit to the number of non-OLPAS chambers that an applicant can contact. Such chambers' recruiting deadlines broadly mirror those of the Pupillage Portal sets.

Pupillage consists of a period of 12 months, where the pupil studies with and under a practising barrister of at least 5 years' experience. The time is traditionally served in two six-month periods under different pupil-masters (three-month periods are becoming increasingly common), usually in the same chambers. Traditionally, the pupil was paid nothing and could earn no fees until the second six-month period, when he or she was entitled to undertake work independently. All sets are now required to pay their pupils a minimum of £12,000 per year. Some pay considerably more than that, although others have applied for exemption and do not guarantee any income. The Bar is a highly varied profession, both in terms of the specialism (or otherwise) of individual sets of chambers, and in the financial rewards available. For sets doing predominantly publicly funded work, earnings are low for new practitioners. In more specialised areas serving private clients, such as commercial, tax, or chancery work, earnings are far higher, and at least comparable to those of similarly experienced solicitors in big city firms.

After pupillage, the new barrister must find a seat or "tenancy" in a set of chambers. Chambers are groups of barristers, and tend to comprise between 20 and 60 barristers. The members of a Chambers share the rent and facilities, such as the service of "clerks" (who combine some of the functions of agents, administrators and diary managers), secretaries and other support staff. Most chambers operate a system whereby the members contribute to these common expenses by paying a certain percentage of their gross income. However, there is no [[profit sharing|profit-sharing]] as in a [[business partnership]]. Individual barristers keep the fees they earn, beyond what they have to pay towards professional expenses.

The Bar remains a highly individualistic profession, and earnings vary widely – from some newly qualified (usually criminal) juniors who are lucky to earn £25,000 per year to the top [[Queen's Counsel]] (QCs or 'silks' as they are known, from their silk gowns) making well in excess of £1 million a year (with a handful of tax and commercial QCs reported to earn more than £2 million a year).&lt;ref&gt;Thom Dyke, {{cite news|title=Challenging the stereotype of the overpaid junior barrister|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/student/article6864882.ece|work=The Times  |accessdate=25 June 2011 | date=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not all barristers practise from the Inns (for reasons such as the limited amount of space available), the majority still practise from chambers. The names placed on boards at the entrances of many of the staircases of the buildings within the Inns are the names of the tenant barristers (and occasionally distinguished members now prominent in judicial or political life) practising from the chambers in those buildings.

==Popular culture==
Some of the principles and traditions that have given the profession its unique character have been caricatured in [[John Mortimer]]'s ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'' tales and the television episodes based on them.  Novelist [[Caro Fraser]] also wrote a popular series of books about a fictional series of barrister's chambers called Caper Court.

In television the bar was popularised by actor [[John Thaw]]'s portrayal of the title character in ''[[Kavanagh QC]]''.  Peter Moffat (who created ''Kavanagh QC'') also later created a further television series about barristers called ''[[Silk (TV series)|Silk]]'' (in reference to the silk gowns of Queen's Counsel) and ''[[North Square]]''.

The '''British Museum Reading Room''', situated in the centre of the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]] of the [[British Museum]], used to be the main [[Reference library|reading room]] of the [[British Library]]. In 1997, this function moved to the new British Library building at [[St Pancras, London]], but the Reading Room remains in its original form at the British Museum.

Designed by [[Sydney Smirke]] and opened in 1857, the Reading Room was in continual use until its temporary closure for renovation in 1997. It was reopened in 2000, and from 2007 to 2014 it was used to stage temporary exhibitions. It has since been closed while its future use remains under discussion.

=== Construction and design ===
In the early 1850s the museum library was in need of a larger reading room and the then-Keeper of Printed Books, [[Antonio Panizzi]], following an earlier competition idea by [[William Hosking]], came up with the thought of a round room in the central courtyard. The building was designed by [[Sydney Smirke]] and was constructed between 1854 and 1857. The building used cast iron, concrete, glass and the latest technology in ventilation and heating. The dome, inspired by the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon in Rome]], has a diameter of 42.6 metres but is not technically free standing: constructed in segments on cast iron, the ceiling is suspended and made out of [[papier-mâché]]. Book stacks built around the reading room were made of iron to take the huge weight and add fire protection. There were forty kilometres of shelving in the stacks prior to the library's relocation to the new site.&lt;ref name="BM site"&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/the_museums_story/reading_room.aspx Reading Room], British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The British Museum Library ===
The Reading Room was officially opened on 2 May 1857 with a 'breakfast' (that included champagne and ice cream) laid out on the catalogue desks. A public viewing was held between 8 and 16 May which attracted over 62,000 visitors. Tickets to it included a plan of the library.&lt;ref name="BM site" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BM site2"&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/archives/i/invitation_to_a_private_view_o.aspx Invitation to a private view of the Round Reading Room], British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular users had to apply in writing and be issued a reader's ticket by the Principal Librarian.&lt;ref name="BM site" /&gt; During the period of the [[British Library]], access was restricted to registered researchers only; however, reader's credentials were generally available to anyone who could show that they were a serious researcher. The Reading Room was used by a large number of famous figures, including notably [[Sun Yat-sen]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[George Orwell]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Vladimir Lenin]] (using the name Jacob Richter&lt;ref name="BM site" /&gt;),  [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, Stanley ''Jinnah of Pakistan'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. G. Wells]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Footprint England |author= Charles Godfrey-Faussett|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|url= https://books.google.com/?id=l-eiweyYvyEC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=%22British+Museum+Reading+Room%22|id={{ISBN|1903471915}}|isbn=978-1-903471-91-3|pages=884|date=2004-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]].&lt;ref name="BM site" /&gt;

In 1973, the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum, but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997.

=== Closure and restoration ===
In 1997 the British Library moved to its own specially constructed building next to [[St Pancras Station]] and all the books and shelving were removed. As part of the redevelopment of the Great Court, the Reading Room was fully renovated and restored, including the papier-mâché ceiling which was repaired to its original colour scheme, having previously undergone radical redecorations (the initial design of the roof was considered excessive at the time).&lt;ref name="BM site" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/329922.stm Facelift for British Museum's reading room], BBC 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reading Room was reopened in 2000, allowing all visitors, and not just library ticket-holders, to enter it. It held a collection of 25,000 books focusing on the cultures represented in the museum along with an information centre and the [[Walter Annenberg|Walter and Leonore Annenberg]] Centre.&lt;ref name="BM site" /&gt;

=== Exhibition space ===
In 2007 the books and facilities installed in 2000 were removed, and the Reading Room was relaunched as a venue for special exhibitions, beginning with one featuring China's [[Terracotta Army]]. The general library for visitors (Paul Hamlyn Library) moved to a room accessible through nearby Room 2, but closed permanently on 13 August 2011. This is an earlier library that has also had distinguished users, including [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/libraries_and_archives.aspx Museum libraries and archives], British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

== References in art and popular culture ==
The British Museum Reading Room has become iconic. It is the subject of an eponymous poem, "The British Museum Reading Room", by [[Louis MacNeice]]. Much of the action of [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s [[1965 in literature|1965]] novel ''[[The British Museum Is Falling Down]]'' takes place in the old Reading Room. The  'Glass Ceiling' of Anabel Donald's 1994 novel is the ceiling of the Reading Room, where the denouement is set.

[[Alfred Hitchcock]] used the Reading Room and the dome of the British Museum as a location for the climax of his first sound film ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (1929). Other movies with key scenes in the Reading Room include ''[[Night of the Demon]]'' (1957) and in the [[2001 in film|2001]] [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] [[anime]] [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] ''[[Read or Die]]'', the Reading Room is used as the secret entrance to the British Library's fictional "Special Operations Division".

Probably the first work of fiction in which the British Museum Reading Room plays an important part as a setting is ''[[New Grub Street]]'' by [[George Gissing]], published in 1891.

In [[Max Beerbohm]]'s short story "[[Enoch Soames]]", first published in May 1916, an obscure writer makes a [[deal with the Devil]] to visit the Reading Room one hundred years in the future, in order to know what posterity thinks about him and his work.

The British Museum and the Reading Room serve as the settings for ''An Encounter at the Museum'', an anthology of romance novellas by [[Claudia Dain]], Michelle Marcos, [[Deb Marlowe]], and Ava Stone.

[[Virginia Woolf]] made reference to the British Museum Reading Room in a passage from her 1929 essay, ''[[A Room of One's Own]]''. She wrote, "The swing doors swung open, and there one stood under the vast dome, as if one were a thought in the huge bald forehead which is so splendidly encircled by a band of famous names." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoberman|first=Ruth|title=Women in the British Reading Room During the Late-Nineteenth and Early-Twentieth Centuries: From Quasi- to Counterpublic|journal=Feminist Studies|date=Fall 2002|volume=28|issue=3|pages=489–512|doi=10.2307/3178782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] visited the Reading Room on 10 September 1860 with his London friend Henry T. Parker, and reported that "Parker calls &amp; takes me to the British Museum, to see the Reading Room, wh. has been built since 1856 [Dana's prior visit].  It is the room where students &amp; readers have their desks, &amp; consult the text books, cyclopedias, catalogues &amp;c., &amp; from wh. they send orders for books to the Library – the Library not being visited, at all, for study.  There is no such room as this in Europe.  It is a circle, with dome, lighted from above, &amp; its diameter is 4 feet greater than that of the dome of St. Paul's.  The autographs are now open to view of all, spread out in glass cases, – as well as many other lit. curiosities.  This is the grandest Literary &amp; Scientific institution (not for instruction) in the world.  The Reading Room, I told Parker, was a temple to the deification of Bibliology." &lt;ref&gt;Wm. H. Dana, Jr., ''Journal of a Voyage Round the World 1859–1860'', [[Library of America]] Ed. pp. 861–862 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''CD-ROM encyclopedia''' is an [[encyclopedia]] delivered as [[reference software]] on a [[CD-ROM]] disc for use on a [[personal computer]]. This was the usual way computer users accessed encyclopedic knowledge from early 1990s until the late 1990s. Later [[DVD]] discs replaced CD-ROMs and from mid-2000s [[internet encyclopedias]] became dominant and replaced disc-based software encyclopedias. Some examples of CD-ROM encyclopedia are [[Encarta]], [[Grolier]] Multimedia Encyclopedia, and Britannica.

CD-ROM encyclopedias were usually a [[MacOS]] or [[Microsoft Windows]] (3.0, 3.1 or 95/98) application on a CD-ROM disc. The user would execute the encyclopedia's software program to see a menu that allowed him to start browsing the encyclopedia's articles, and most encyclopedias also supported a way to search the contents of the encyclopedia. The article text was usually [[hyperlink]]ed and also included [[photographs]], [[Digital audio|audio]] clips (for example in articles about historical speeches or musical instruments), and [[videoclip]]s. In the CD-ROM age the videoclips had usually a low resolution, often 160x120 or 320x240 pixels. Such encyclopedias which made use of photos, audio and video were also called [[Multimedia|multimedia encyclopedia]]s.

The '''Danube–Black Sea Canal''' ({{lang-ro|Canalul Dunăre – Marea Neagră}}) is a navigable [[canal]] in [[Romania]], which runs from [[Cernavodă]], on the [[Danube]] river, to [[Constanța]] (southern arm, the main branch), and to [[Năvodari]] (northern arm), on the [[Black Sea]]. Administrated from [[Agigea]], it is an important part of the [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal|European canal system]] that links the [[North Sea]] (through the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal) to the Black Sea. The main branch of the canal, with a length of {{convert|64.4|km|mi|abbr=on}}, which connects the [[Port of Cernavodă]] with the [[Port of Constanța]], was built between 1976–1984, while the north branch, known as the '''Poarta Albă – Midia Năvodari Canal''', with a length of {{convert|31.2|km|mi|abbr=on}}, connecting [[Poarta Albă]] and [[Port of Midia]], was built between 1983–1987.&lt;ref name="IPTANA"&gt;[http://www.iptana.ro/romania/download/PARTEA%20IV_Hidro.pdf The history of the Danube – Black Sea Canal] at iptana.ro&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canal was notorious as the site of [[labor camp]]s in early 1950s [[Communist Romania]], when at any given time, up to 20,000 [[political prisoner]]s worked on its excavation. The total number of people used as a workforce for the entire period is unknown, with the total number of deaths estimated at several thousand. These works were later used in the [[Valea Seacă River (Carasu)|Carasu]] irrigation system.&lt;ref name="IPTANA"/&gt;

==Geography==
The course of the canal follows mostly the course of the former [[Valea Seacă River (Carasu)|Carasu River]], originally a tributary of the Danube. Therefore, hydrographically it also has the function of conveying the runoff from a {{convert|1031|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} drainage basin to the Black Sea.

The main branch extends from [[Cernavodă]] on the Danube to [[Poarta Albă]]. On this [[Reach (geography)|reach]] it goes near or through the settlements of Cernavodă, [[Saligny, Constanța|Saligny]], [[Mircea Vodă, Constanța|Mircea Vodă]], [[Medgidia]], [[Castelu]], and Poarta Albă. On this reach the canal is joined on the left bank by tributaries: [[Valea Plantației River|Valea Plantației]], [[Valea Cișmelei River|Valea Cișmelei]], [[Agi Cabul River|Agi Cabul]], [[Castelu River|Castelu]] and [[Nisipari River|Nisipari]]. On the left side it is joined by tributaries: [[Popa Nica River|Popa Nica]], [[Medgidia River|Medgidia]], [[Siminoc River (Black Sea)|Siminoc]] and [[Șerplea River|Șerplea]]

At Poarta Albă the canal bifurcates into two branches. The main canal goes to the South, towards the [[Port of Constanța|Port of Constanța Sud – Agigea]]. It passes near the settlements of [[Murfatlar]], [[Cumpăna]] and [[Agigea]]. On its reach it is joined on the left bank by tributaries [[Cocoș River (Agigea)|Cocoș]], [[Valea Seacă River (Carasu)|Valea Seacă]], [[Potârnichea River (Agigea)|Potârnichea]], [[Lazu River (Carasu)|Lazu]] and on the right bank by the [[Agigea River|Agigea]]

The north branch (Poarta Albă – Midia Năvodari Canal), goes towards the [[Port of Midia]]. It passes near [[Poarta Albă|Nazarcea]], [[Lumina, Constanța|Lumina]], [[Ovidiu]] and [[Năvodari]]. On its [[Reach (geography)|reach]] it is joined by tributaries [[Nazarcea River|Nazarcea]] and [[Valea Adâncă River (Carasu)|Valea Adâncă]], both from the left bank.

===Motivation===
The main reasons for the building of the canal were to circumvent the [[Danube Delta]], which is difficult to navigate, to shorten the distance to the Black Sea, and several issues related to the loading and unloading of ships.&lt;ref name="spulber"&gt;Nicolas Spulber, "The Danube – Black Sea Canal and the Russian Control over the Danube", in ''Economic Geography'', vol. 30, no.3 (July 1954), pp. 236–245&lt;/ref&gt;

In its delta, the Danube is divided into three main branches, none of which is suited to optimal navigation:&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt; [[Chilia branch]] is the deepest, but its mouths were not stable, which made navigation dangerous; [[Sulina branch]] is not deep enough for maritime ships to navigate on it and it also used to be isolated from the [[Căile Ferate Române|railroad system]]; [[Sfântu Gheorghe branch]] is shallow and sinuous.

At the time when the decision to build the canal was taken, it was officially announced that these works would also serve a secondary purpose, that of [[land reclamation]]&amp;nbsp;– with the drainage of marshes in the area.&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt; Also during the construction period, the Danube – Black Sea Canal was advertised as a fast and direct connection between the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Volga-Don Canal]] and Central Europe.&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt;

The waterway passes through the towns of Medgidia and Murfatlar, both of which have been turned into [[inland port]]s.&lt;ref name="UNECE"/&gt; It was designed to facilitate the transit of convoys comprising as much as six [[Towboat|towed]] [[barge]]s, up to 3,000 in [[tonnage]] each, {{convert|296|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|22.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide&lt;ref name="IPTANA"/&gt; (ships of up to 5,000 in [[tonnage]], as long as {{convert|138|m|ft|abbr=on}} and with as much as {{convert|16.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} in [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] and {{convert|5.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in [[draft (hull)|draft]] can also pass through the canal).&lt;ref name="UNECE"/&gt; The structure is bound by four [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] (in Cernavodă and Agigea, and in Ovidiu and [[Năvodari|Midia]], respectively).&lt;ref name="IPTANA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNECE"/&gt;

In its final phase, the canal took over nine years to construct; {{convert|381000000|m3|ft3|abbr=on}} of soil were excavated&lt;ref name="IPTANA"/&gt; (greater than the amount involved in building the [[Panama Canal|Panama]] and [[Suez Canal|Suez]] canals),&lt;ref name="turnock"&gt;David Turnock, "The Danube – Black Sea Canal and its impact on Southern Romania", in ''Geo Journal'' 12:1 (1986), pp.65–79&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|5000000|m3|ft3|abbr=on}} of concrete were used for the locks and support walls.&lt;ref name="IPTANA"/&gt;

==Early history==

===Precedents===
The earliest plans for building this canal were in late 1830s. The [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianopol]] (September 14, 1829) canceled the trade monopoly of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Danubian Principalities]] of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], allowing these countries to build their own fleets by 1834. Both Romanian and non-Romanian ships used mostly the Danube port cities of [[Brăila]] and [[Galați]], which saw an economic boom. But there were a number of barriers to this trade: the Ottomans controlled the navigation regime on the Danube, while the [[Russian Empire]] – the access to the [[Black Sea]] in the [[Danube Delta]], and there was little the Danubian Principalities could do to rectify this situation. Both countries welcomed the [[Austrian Empire]]'s 1834 decision, endorsed by Count [[István Széchenyi]], to extend the route of the first [[pyroscaphe]] navigation company to the maritime Danube. The Austrian initiative was received unpleasantly by the Russians, who considered their trade through [[Odessa]] and ports in the [[Crimea]] threatened by the development of Brăila and Galați. Without resolving to direct measures, Russians, who controlled the [[Sulina branch]], started to show rigidity, instituting on February 7, 1836 a compulsory [[quarantine]] on the island of [[Letea]], collecting taxes to cover Russian financial deficit, and by not performing maintenance for the navigation on the Sulina branch to remove the continuous deposits of sand.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

This gave Austrians the idea to dig a canal to connect the Danube with the Black Sea at the shortest point before the Delta, between [[Rasova]] or Cernavodă (''Bogaz Köi'') and Constanța (''Küstendjie''), and a parallel railway. The Austrian project, however, was rejected by the [[Ottoman Porte]]. Western diplomats and newspapers accused the Russian government that through bribing and intimidation, it determined the Ottoman officials to reject the proposal of Szechenyi's company. In 1839, Széchenyi got the approval of his and Ottoman governments to ensure the transport of goods and people without getting to Sulina by a [[transshipment]] on dry land. Carts and coaches made a 7–8 hour trip from Cernavodă to Constanța, where people and goods were boarding other ships for [[Istanbul]]. The enterprise was scrapped after 4 years due to non-profitability because of a low number of passengers, high cost of transport, and poor conditions of accosting in the unfit [[roadstead]] of the port of Constanța.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

In its place, a new Brăila-Istanbul route was established. However, by 1844, the depth of the Sulina branch has decreased to 7–9 feet from 13–14 feet in 1836, due to lack of dredging by the Russian authorities which controlled the passage. The Austrian government made a new attempt to cut a canal, sending the military engineer Colonel Baron [[Karl von Bigaro]] to prospect the land. But the idea had to be abandoned again due to technical problem, first of all due to the unfitness of the port of Constanța for large international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, the Moldavian scholar [[Ion Ionescu de la Brad]] proposed yet another project, supported by [[Ion Ghica]] and by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] diplomat [[David Urquhart]], the secretary of the [[United Kingdom]]'s Embassy in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="hossu" /&gt; Ghica lobbied Brad's project to [[Ahmed Vefik]], who gave a negative response for fear of provoking Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crimean War]] of 1854–1856, added a military and strategical dimension for this plan. The British-[[Second French Empire|French]] Allies landed at [[Varna]] in the summer of 1854, followed by the withdrawal of Russian troops from Wallachia and Moldavia and the advancement of Ottoman and Austrian ones. In 1855, the French government put forward an initiative, and the Ottomans approved it, for the cheapest solution: build a strategic road between Cernavodă and Constanța. Engineer [[Charles Lalanne]] was put in charge of these works, that started in the summer of 1855 and were finished by the year's end. According to the newspaper ''[[Zimbrul]]'' of [[Iași]], the work was performed by 300 physically strong men of moderate character selected in Moldavia and Wallachia.&lt;ref name="Petrescu, pp. 139-140"&gt;Petrescu, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt;

The building of the road did not eliminate, however, the need for a canal, and the Austrian government renewed its persuading efforts. According to ''[[Gazeta de Transilvania]]'' in July 1855, Baron [[Karl Ludwig von Bruck]], the Austrian Finance Minister, founded a [[Joint stock company|stock company]] to build the desired canal. According to an article in ''Zimbrul'' on July 23, 1855, the project was of interest to Britain, the French Empire and the Austrian Empire, who were asking the Ottoman government to allot the concession of the canal and the fitting of the port of Constanța to a [[consortium]] under the direction of the three countries. The Ottomans were to lease a [[League (unit)|league]] of land on each side of the canal for 99 years, where colonist could be settled. Goods were to travel freely, with ships having to pay only a ''per tone'' tax, significantly lower than the one on the Sulina branch. According to the newspaper ''[[Steaua Dunării]]'' from January 24, 1856, the [[Sultan]] issued a ''[[firman]]'' to the Anglo-French-Austrian consortium Wilson-Morny-Breda, represented by [[Forbes Campbell]], authorizing it to build the canal which was to be called [[Abdul Medjid]]. The 12 articles of the Concession Act were published in ''[[Bukurester Deutsche Zeitung]]''.&lt;ref name="Petrescu, pp. 139-140"/&gt;

The construction plans for the canal took a different turn with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] on March 30, 1856, ending the war. Russia ceded the Danube mouths to the Ottomans and southern Bessarabia (lately organised as the [[Cahul County|Cahul]], [[Bolgrad County|Bolgrad]] and [[Ismail County|Ismail counties]]) to their vassal, Moldavia. The freedom of international navigation on the Danube was restored; passage taxes were canceled, police and quarantine rules were simplified; and the [[European Commission of the Danube]] was established, with representatives of 7 powers: Britain, France, Austria, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. The Commission was responsible for the clearing of the Danube mouths from deposits of the river, and when necessary with clearing natural barriers, with the goal of ensuring of good conditions for navigation. The effect was that Austria, Britain, and France changed their attitude to the project for a Danube-Black Sea canal. The newspaper ''Zimbrul'' announced on May 25, 1856 that the plan for building the canal was abandoned; instead a railroad line Cernavodă – Constanța was to be built. After two and a half years of construction, the latter was inaugurated on October 4, 1860.&lt;ref name="Petrescu, p. 141"&gt;Petrescu, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Following the building of a railway connection in 1860, goods were easily and inexpensively transported from Constanța by rail, so plans for a canal were again abandoned.&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt;

As the [[United Principalities]] of Moldavia and Wallachia (1859) remained formally Ottoman vassals, and moreover Dobruja was directly administered by the Ottomans, the idea to build the canal was not of interest to Romanians then. But following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]], Romania acquired formal independence, lost again southern Bessarabia to Russia, but gained [[Dobruja]]. The idea to build a canal became a national issue, which could promote Romania's international trade.&lt;ref name="Petrescu, p. 141"/&gt; However, in the following years the development of trade was concentrated mainly on the [[Sulina Canal]]. Another project was consequently rejected by [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] after consultations with [[Grigore Antipa]].&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt; During World War I, [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] authorities taking part in the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|occupation of southern Romania]] proposed a canal from Cernavodă to Constanța, passing through Murfatlar, of which 10 miles would be in a [[canal tunnel|tunnel]] (Cernavodă-Murfatlar) and the rest of 27 miles would be in the open.&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt;

In 1927, the Romanian engineer [[Jean Stoenescu-Dunăre]] drafted a new set of plans.&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt; Afterwards, because of the [[Great Depression]], World War II, and political turmoil in Romania (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), construction did not start until 1949, after the establishment of the [[Communist Romania|Romanian Communist regime]].

=== Construction of the canal in 1949-1953 ===
[[File:Timbru Canal 1952.jpg|thumb|200px|1951 postage stamp ([[overprint]]ed in 1952 following the monetary reform) announcing the canal would be ready in 1955]]

The idea of starting the construction of the Danube–Black Sea Canal seems to have been suggested to Romanian leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] during a visit to the [[Moscow Kremlin]] in 1948. Gheorghiu-Dej's chief of staff stated that Stalin indicated the canal as a means of getting rid of the rich peasants and of the enemies of the people and promised support to the authorities in identifying the people hostile to the regime and by providing construction equipment for the canal. He also stated that Gheorghiu-Dej was not convinced by Stalin's recommendations, suspecting that the canal was actually part of the Soviet Union's expansion strategy.&lt;ref name="hossu"&gt;Valentin Hossu-Longin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080121155611/http://www.ziua.net/display.php?id=195457&amp;data=2006-03-11 "Procesul Canalului Morții"] ("The Trial of the Death Canal") - in ''[[Ziua]]'', March 11, 2006 Archived from [http://www.9am.ro/stiri-revista-presei/2006-03-11/procesul-canalului-mortii.html the original] on January 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Bucurescu - Tragicul Canal Dunăre - Marea Neagră - România Liberă,  March 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been found out, that Stalin's initiative was based on a secret study, commissioned in 1947-1948, which recommended building a soviet submarine base at the Port of Midia, which was suitable because of its proximity to the [[Bosphorus]] and because of the rocky foundation.&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt;

On May 25, 1949, the [[Politburo]] of the Central Committee of the [[Romanian Communist Party|Romanian Workers' Party]] was presented a report of [[comrade]] Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej on the projected construction of a canal linking the Danube and the Black Sea and on the economic and cultural development of the neighboring area. Estimating that this important construction was an important component of the construction of socialism in Romania, the Politbiro recommended that the project be submitted to the [[Council of Ministers]] for the approval of the immediate start of the preparatory work for the construction of the canal. The same day, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, at that time first vice-president of the Council of Ministers, presented his proposal to the council, presided by [[Petru Groza]], which approved it immediately.&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cioroianu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roxana Roseti - Canalul Dunăre-Marea Neagră.

Banners with this slogan were set up in all construction sites of the canal.

In October 1949, the authorities established a General Directorate to oversee both the works and the penal facilities, answering directly to the national leadership. Its first head was [[Gheorghe Hossu]] a former mechanic and tractor-driver who had been promoted first-secretary of the Romanian Worker's party in [[Tulcea County]] and administrator of the State Fisheries. He was replaced in 1951 by [[Meyer Grünberg]], in turn replaced by [[Mihail Povstanschi]] under the name of (Vasile Posteucă) (who held the position in 1952–1953).&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Stegărescu - Paradoxurile istoriei: În România stalinistă, un spion rus fură identitatea unui legionar - Historia [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/portret/articol/paradoxurile-istoriei-romania-stalinista-un-spion-rus-fura-identitatea]&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Adrian Cioroianu]], all three were insufficiently trained for the task they were required to accomplish. By 1952, the Directorate came under the direct supervision of the [[Ministry of Administration and Interior of Romania|Internal Affairs Ministry]], and the [[Securitate]] was allowed direct intervention on the construction site.&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt;

===Forced labor and repression===
{{Communist Romania}}
Prison camps sprang up all along the projected canal route in the summer of 1949 and were quickly filled with political prisoners brought from jails from throughout the country. These first arrivals were soon joined by newly arrested people who were sent to the canal in ever increasing numbers. By 1950 the forced [[labor camps]] set up along the length of the planned canal were filled to capacity; that year alone, up to 15,000 prisoners were held in those camps.&lt;ref name="CPADCR"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.presidency.ro/static/ordine/RAPORT_FINAL_CPADCR.pdf Comisia Prezidenţială pentru Analiza Dictaturii Comuniste din România: Raport Final] / ed.: Vladimir Tismăneanu, Dorin Dobrincu, Cristian Vasile, Bucureşti: Humanitas, 2007, {{ISBN|978-973-50-1836-8}}, pp. 253-261&lt;/ref&gt; By 1953, the number of prisoners had swelled to 20,193,&lt;ref name="CPADCR"/&gt; though older estimates claimed figures as high as 60,000&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,818727,00.html "Unfinished Canal"], in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', August 24, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; (other estimates asserted 100,000&lt;ref name="socor"/&gt; or 40,000&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt; for the entire period). British historian and [[New York University]] professor [[Tony Judt]] claimed in his book, ''[[Postwar (book)|Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945]]'', that, overall, one million Romanians had been imprisoned in various prisons and labor camps, including the Danube-Black Sea Canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Judt|first1=Tony|title=Postwar : a history of Europe since 1945|date=2005|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=1-59420-065-3|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction effort surpassed the resources available to the Romanian economy in the 1950s. The canal was assigned inferior machinery, part of which had already been used on the Soviet [[Volga-Don Canal]],&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt; and building had to rely on primitive techniques (most work appears to have been carried out using [[shovel]]s and [[pickaxe]]s,&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt; which was especially hard in the rocky terrain of [[Northern Dobruja]]). Detainees were allocated to brigades, usually run by common criminals&amp;nbsp;– encouraged to use violence against their subordinates.&lt;ref name="socor"/&gt; In parallel, the region's [[industrialization]], destined to assist in the building effort, was never accomplished.&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt;

Sums allocated for prisoner health, hygiene and nutrition declined dramatically over the years. Food rations were kept to a minimum, and prisoners would often resort to hunting mice and other small animals, or even consuming grass in an attempt to supplement their diet.&lt;ref name="socor"/&gt;

The prisoners comprised dispossessed farmers who had attempted to resist [[collectivization]], former activists of the [[National Peasants' Party]], the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]], and the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jews]], as well as [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Romanian Roman-Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests.&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="socor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gordon"&gt;[http://ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1954_10_EastEurope.pdf Joseph Gordon, ''Eastern Europe: Romania (1954)'', pp. 299–301], at the [[American Jewish Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt; The canal was referred to as the "graveyard of the Romanian [[bourgeoisie]]" by the Communist authorities,&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;[http://www.memorialsighet.ro/en/sala.asp?id=8 ''The Memorial of the Victims of Communism and of the Resistance''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703073455/http://www.memorialsighet.ro/en/sala.asp?id=8 |date=2007-07-03 }}, page for Room 17, Forced Labor&lt;/ref&gt; and the physical elimination of undesirable [[social class]]es was one of its most significant goals.&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="socor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania]] presented an estimate of several thousand deaths among the political prisoners used in the project, significantly higher than 656 officially recorded by an official report from 1968.&lt;ref name="CPADCR"/&gt; Journalist [[Anne Applebaum]] had previously claimed that over 200,000 had died in its construction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Applebaum|first1=Anne|title=Gulag : a history|date=2003|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=9780767900560|page=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of exposure, unsafe equipment, malnutrition, accidents, tuberculosis and other diseases, over-work, etc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author-last=Sherrer|author-first=Hans|title=Gulag: A History|url=http://forejustice.org/wc/gulag_applebaum.html#sdendnote8sym|website=forejustice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; while political analyst [[Vladimir Socor]] had estimated the number of deaths to be "considerably in excess of 10,000".&lt;ref name="socor"/&gt; As such, the project became known as ''The Death Canal'' (''Canalul Morții'').  It has also been called "a cloaca of immense human suffering and mortality".&lt;ref name="rothschild"&gt;[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/ebooks-public/pdfs/0195119924.pdf Joseph Rothschild, Nancy Meriwether Wingfield, ''Return to diversity: A Political History of East Central Europe Since World War II''], [[Oxford University Press]], New York, 1999, p. 161 {{ISBN|0-19-511993-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, authorities left aside sectors of employment for skilled workers&amp;nbsp;– kept in strict isolation from all others,&lt;ref name="socor"/&gt; they were attracted to the site with exceptional salaries (over 5,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]] per month), as well as for young people drafted in the [[Romanian Army]] and whose files indicated "unhealthy origins" (a [[middle-class]] family background). Their numbers fluctuated greatly (regular employees went from 13,200 in 1950 to 15,000 in 1951, to as little as 7,000 in early 1952, and again to 12,500 later in that year).&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt; At the same time, facilities meant to accommodate the projected influx of labor (including homes available on credit) were never actually completed.&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt; This was overlooked by the [[propaganda]] machine, which instead furnished [[Stakhanovite]] stories, according to which work quotas were surpassed by as much as 170%.&lt;ref name="arvatu"&gt;[http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol_37190/basmele_canalului.html Cristina Arvatu, Ilarion Țiu, "Basmele Canalului" ("Fairy Tales of the Canal")], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', September 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities also made the claim that the construction site was offering training to previously unskilled workers&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arvatu"/&gt; (as many as 10,000 in one official communiqué).&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt;

On July 18, 1953, the project came to a discreet halt, all work being suspended for another 23 years&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="socor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, pp. 139, 300&lt;/ref&gt; (according to some sources, the closure had been ordered by Stalin himself, as early as 1952).&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt; The canal camps remained in existence for another year, and their prisoners progressively relocated, to similar conditions at other work sites in [[Northern Dobruja]].&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="socor"/&gt; Penal facilities on the canal site were shut down in mid-1954.&lt;ref name="socor"/&gt;

===Trial===
Blame for the debilitating and unsuccessful works was eventually placed on a group of alleged [[Conspiracy (political)|conspirators]], who were indicted in a [[show trial]] (late 1952)&amp;nbsp;– they faced various trumped-up charges ([[espionage]], [[fraud]], [[sabotage]]). The inquiry was orchestrated by [[Iosif Chișinevschi]].&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt;

Three people were executed (the engine driver [[Nichita Dumitrescu]], and the engineers [[Aurel Rozei-Rozenberg]] and [[Nicolae Vasilescu-Colorado]]); others were imprisoned for various terms.&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gordon"/&gt; Defendants in a second group, around the engineer [[Gheorghe Crăciun]], were sentenced to various harsh penalties (including three [[life imprisonment]]s).&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt; Torture was applied by a [[Securitate]] squad led by [[Alexandru Nicolschi]], as a means to obtain [[forced confession]]s.&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt;

[[File:Danube-Black Sea Canal.jpg|thumb|250px|A lock on the Canal]]
In June 1973, the project, with a complete new design,&lt;ref name="IPTANA"/&gt; was restarted by [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who had previously ordered the [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] of people sentenced in the 1952 trial,&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt; and who aimed to withdraw the Lower Danube from Soviet control (which had been consecrated by the 1948 [[Danube Conference]]).&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="berend"/&gt; In official [[propaganda]], where the 1950s precedent was no longer mentioned,&lt;ref name="berend"/&gt; the canal was referred to as the ''Blue Highway'' (''Magistrala Albastră'').&lt;ref name="berend"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hossu"/&gt; New and large machinery, produced inside Romania, was introduced to the site.&lt;ref name="berend"/&gt; The southern arm was completed in May 1984, with the northern arm being inaugurated in October 1987.&lt;ref name="berend"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt;

The cost of building the canal is estimated to be around 2 billion [[United States dollar|dollars]], and was supposed to be recovered in 50 years. However, as of 2005, it has a yearly income of only a little over 3 million [[euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_23177-Canalul-Dunare-Marea-Neagra-isi-va-scoate-banii-in-633-de-ani.htm Marian Cosor, "Canalul Dunăre-Marea Neagră își va scoate banii în 633 de ani" ("The Danube – Black Sea Canal Will Absorb Its Construction Cost in 633 Years")], on Radio Constanța, May 26, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
For much of the 1950s, the Danube – Black Sea Canal was celebrated in [[agitprop]] literature (notably, in [[Geo Bogza]]'s 1950 reportage ''Începutul epopeii'', "The Beginning of the Epic", and in [[Petru Dumitriu]]'s ''[[Drum fără pulbere]]'', "Dustless Road"),&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt; music ([[Leon Klepper]]'s [[symphonic poem]] ''Dunărea se varsă în mare'', "The Danube Flows to the Sea"),&lt;ref name="spulber"/&gt; and film ([[Ion Bostan (film director)|Ion Bostan]]'s 1951 ''Canalul Dunăre-Marea Neagră, o construcție a păcii'' – "The Danube – Black Sea Canal, a Construction of Peace"). During the 1980s, the song "Magistrala Albastră" (The blue freeway), performed by [[Dan Spătaru]] and [[Mirabela Dauer]] and using the Canal as its setting, was frequently broadcast in official and semi-official contexts.&lt;ref name="arvatu"/&gt;

During the period of [[liberalization]] preceding the ''[[July Theses]]'', literature was allowed to make several references to the Canal's penitentiary history. Examples include [[Marin Preda]]'s ''[[Cel mai iubit dintre pământeni]]''&lt;ref name="cioroianu"/&gt; and, most likely, [[Eugen Barbu]]'s ''Principele'' (by means of an [[allegory]], set during the 18th century [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] rules).&lt;ref name=deletant&gt;[[Dennis Deletant]], ''Ceaușescu and the Securitate: Coercion and Dissent in Romania, 1965–1989'', M.E. Sharpe, London, 1995, p.182 {{ISBN|1-56324-633-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973–1974, [[Ion Cârja]], a former prisoner, wrote a book titled ''Canalul morții'', "The death canal", detailing his sufferings during incarceration; it was first published in Romania in 1993, after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Revolution of 1989]]. In [[György Dragomán]]'s 2005 novel, ''The White King'', set in 1980s Romania, the main protagonist 11-year-old boy's father is deported to a labor camp to work on the Danube-Black Sea Canal.

An '''E-card''' is similar to a [[postcard]] or [[greeting card]], with the primary difference being that it is created using [[digital media]] instead of paper or other traditional materials.  E-cards are made available by publishers usually on various [[Internet]] sites, where they can be sent to a recipient, usually via [[e-mail]]. It is also considered more [[environmentally friendly]] compared to traditional paper cards.  E-card businesses are considered environmentally friendly because their carbon footprint is generally much lower compared to paper card companies because paper is not used in the end product.

E-cards are [[Digital data|digital]] "[[Content (media and publishing)|content]]", which makes them much more versatile than traditional greeting cards.  For example, unlike traditional greetings, E-cards can be easily sent to many people at once or extensively personalized by the sender.  Conceivably they could be saved to any computer or electronic device or even viewed on a television set, and digital video E-cards have begun emerging.

Typically an E-card sender chooses from an on-line catalog of E-cards made available on a publisher's web site.  After selecting a card, the sender can personalize it to various degrees by adding a message, photo, or video.  Finally the sender specifies the recipient's e-mail address and the web site delivers an e-mail message to the recipient on behalf of the sender.

==Printed E-cards==

Some E-cards are intended to be printed out rather than sent via e-mail; to most people, however, these are not considered E-cards, but are simply home-made [[greeting cards]].  The advantage to this over a traditional greeting sometimes can be cost savings, or sometimes simply the ability to "create" something for the recipient rather than choosing a fully completed paper card.

==Technological evolution==
Since its conception in 1994 by [[Judith Donath]],&lt;ref name=wiredPostcards /&gt; the technology behind the E-Card has changed significantly. One technical aspect that has remained mostly constant is the delivery mechanism: the e-mail received by the recipient contains not the E-card itself, but an individually coded link back to the publisher's web site that displays the sender's card.

===Postcards and greeting cards===
Like their paper counterparts, "postcards" use visual art (static or animated images or video) and provide a space for a personal note to be added.  These were the first type of E-card in use. Like their paper counterparts, cyber "greeting cards" provide a greeting along with the visual art. Variations range from E-cards with fixed greetings like a paper card to selectable greetings (from drop-down lists or other selection options) to changeable suggested greetings.

===Flash animation===
This type of E-card is based on two-dimensional vector animation controlled with a scripting language.  The format is proprietary to Adobe; however, widespread usage of Adobe's software allows this type of card to be easily viewed on most of today's computers.  The recipient sees an animated short usually 15–30 seconds in duration.  The animation often appears to have a cartoon style due to the nature of the content, though some Flash creations can be quite sophisticated and realistic.  A sound track which may contain speech or music usually accompanies the animation.

Flash animated greeting cards can include interactivity, for example, asking the viewer to choose a picture to animate; however, most Flash E-cards are designed to convey the sentiment of the sender through simple observation.

Flash animated cards are offered today by almost all major E-card publishers and are consequently the most common format used.

===Video E-cards===
"Video E-cards" use a combination of personalized text and video to convey the message to the recipient. A number of such services exist such as Rattlebox where the user selects and customizes text on a prerecorded video, and DVCards.com where a user with a web camera actually records their own video to send.

===Mobile E-cards===
6
With the advance in mobile technologies, Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) which is basically picture SMS, became more and more popular. E-cards can now be sent to mobile devices and phones. Mobile E-cards or 'MCards' as they are more commonly known are then offered by different mobile content providers and carriers. Similar to E-cards, MCards can contain multiple pictures, music and text messages. Also MCards are considered the cards sent via one or another mobile application.

One of the first companies that created MCards is a Dutch Company called Mgreetings (established in 2003). MCards can be sent from a PC in a similar way as sending E-cards. Users can go to a website online, select a card enter the recipient's mobile number, and that card will be sent to the recipient's mobile phone as an MMS.

===Web based multi-media E-cards===

The web-based card creation has been evolving becoming more creative. The user can create greeting cards online choosing backgrounds, drag and drop images, animations, smilies and write text that look like handwriting. The E-card may contain videos and music as well.

===Face upload E-cards===

Flash 10 technology now enables sites to develop bespoke applications which can upload photos, manipulating them and cut out the head from it.  The user can then embed it onto an animation so as to achieve a much higher level of personalization.

===E-cards games===

Some E-cards include interactive games. The games usually contain animation and music much like other animated E-cards and have the same functionality allowing the sender to add a personal message.

==History==
The [[greeting card]] metaphor was employed early in the life of the [[World Wide Web]]. The first postcard site, ''The Electric Postcard'' was created in late 1994 by [[Judith Donath]] at the [[MIT Media Lab]].&lt;ref name="wiredPostcards"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.04/net_surf.html |title='&amp;#39;Wired Magazine'&amp;#39;, April 1995 |publisher=Wired.com |date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started slowly: 10-20 cards a day were sent in the first weeks, 1000-2000 a day over the first summer, and then it gained momentum rapidly. During the 1995-96 Christmas season, there were days when over 19,000 cards were sent; by late spring of 1996 over 1.7 million cards had been sent in total.&lt;ref name = "EPostcard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smg.media.mit.edu/People/Judith/Thesis/SociableInfoSpaceCh.frame.html |title=Donath, Judith. 1996. Inhabiting the Virtual City |publisher=Smg.media.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source code for this service was made publicly available, with the stipulation that users share improvements with each other. ''The Electric Postcard'' won numerous awards, including a 1995 GNN Best of the Net award.&lt;ref name = "GNN95"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/GNN%27S+second+annual+%22Best+of+the+Net%22+awards+celebrate+the+rich...-a017549824 GNN 2nd annual best of the net], [http://smg.media.mit.edu/people/judith/EPMay09/references.html Partial list of references to ''The Electric Postcard]''&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT’s postcards and remained the dominant and the only documented E-card service until the late fall of 1995. In Nov 1995,&lt;ref name = "marloRegistration"&gt;[http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/registry-data.jsp?domain=marlo.com Registry Data | Network Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt; Awesome Cyber Cards and also then known as marlo.com (located at marlo.com until Oct 2010, now moved), began developing the Internet greeting card, a digital Internet card including a fixed or suggested greeting as well as an image.

When the [[Internet Archive]] began capturing Web sites across the Internet in the fall of 1996, it created a reservoir of information about E-card development by preserving Internet history from that time and from earlier time-marked Internet pages captured at that time. The Awesome Cards web pages, captured on Nov 10,1996 and available at the [[Wayback Machine]]  demonstrate its development of the cyber greeting card through the year 1996 as one drills down through its card collections.&lt;ref name="AwesomeCardsArchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.marlo.com/card.htm |title=Awesome Cards 1st Collection Archive |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=1996-11-10 |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961110023222/http://www.marlo.com/card.htm |archivedate=November 10, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the holiday collections from earlier that same year give a virtual time-stamp,.&lt;ref name="AwesomeCardsHolidaysArchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.marlo.com/holiday.htm |title=Time Stamp Archive of 1996 Holiday Collections |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=1996-11-10 |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961110024526/http://www.marlo.com/holiday.htm |archivedate=November 10, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  of greeting card development, starting with Valentines with fixed or semi-fixed greetings in February 1996 and progressing through greeting cards with changeable suggested greetings by the Thanksgiving collection.&lt;ref name="AwesomeCardsChangeableGreetingsArchived"&gt;{{cite web|url=//marlo.com/thanksgv.htm |title=Awesome Cards Changeable Greetings 1st Archived |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=1999-02-24 |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990224090147/http://marlo.com/thanksgv.htm |archivedate=February 24, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-1996, a number of sites had developed E-cards.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.latimes.com/HOME/BUSINESS/PICK/1996/pick960510.htm |title=LATimes May 10, 1996 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=1997-08-06 |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970806013714/http://www.latimes.com/HOME/BUSINESS/PICK/1996/pick960510.htm |archivedate=August 6, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid October 1996, directly emailable greeting cards and postcards ("Email Express") were developed and introduced by Awesome Cards, based on new capabilities introduced in the Netscape 3.0 browser. This is the first time the E-card itself could be emailed directly by the card sender to the recipient rather than having an announcement sent with a link to the card's location at the E-card site.&lt;ref name = "DirectlyEmailable"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Awesome+Cyber+Cards+Introduces+Truly+Emailable+Greeting+Cards+over...-a018760585 E-cards Sent Directly Within Email Message], [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Awesome+Cyber+Cards+Introduces+Truly+Emailable+Greeting+Cards+over...-a018760585  Email Express]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Sep 1996 and Thanksgiving 1997,&lt;ref name="BlueMtnEcards"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/blue-mountain-arts-inc  BlueMtn Ecards],    [https://web.archive.org/web/19971210093422/http://www.bluemountain.com/  BlueMtn 1st Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; a paper greeting card company named Blue Mountain developed E-cards on its web site. Blue Mountain grew quickly by allowing visitors to create greetings for others to use. Blue Mountain further expanded when Microsoft promoted its service on its free Hotmail service. This affiliation ceased and Blue Mountain sued Microsoft in Nov 1998 for putting email card announcements from it and other E-card companies in the junk folder of its Hotmail users.

By 1999, major capital was starting to flow into the Internet, beginning the dotcom boom. Of the E-card sites, Blue Mountain Arts was noteworthy in this period for its sale in October 1999 to [[Excite@Home]] for $780M (which represent a price of $71 per unique monthly user).&lt;ref name = "BlueMtnSale2Excite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/American-Greetings-buys-Excite-unit/2100-1023_3-272977.html |title=CNET Reports Blue Mtn Sale |publisher=News.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction has been referenced by [[CNN]] and Business 2.0 as evidence of the [[Dot-com bubble]]. On September 13, 2001, three weeks before filing for bankruptcy on October 1, 2001, Excite@Home sold BlueMountain.com to [[American Greetings]] for $35M, or $3.23 per unique monthly user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecommerce-guide.com/news/news/article.php/884231/ExciteHome-Greets-Ecard-Firm-with-BlueMountaincom.htm |title=Excite@Home Greets E-card Firm with BlueMountain.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web site BlueMountain.com remains a large web site, primarily focused on E-cards. In June 2008, JustAnotherDotCom.com purchased the free E-card site Greeting-cards.com and added it to their own greeting card site, which made them one of the largest E-card sites in the world{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.

Several non-profit organizations offer free E-cards as a way of having a supporter introduce the organization to another individual.  In 2006, [[SOS Children's Villages - USA]] began offering free E-cards for many occasions such as birthdays, thank yous, and Mother's Day.

According to data provided by [[Google]], searches for e-cards have declined to less than 1% of their past levels, with interest declining since record-keeping began in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=e-cards|title=Google Trends: e-cards|publisher=Google|accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==
Sending an E-card to a given recipient invariably involves giving that recipient's email address to the E-card service – a third party. As with other third-party email services (such as mailing-list companies), the operator has the chance to misuse this address. One example of misuse is if the E-card service sends advertisements to the recipient's address. Under anti-spam rules used by major ISPs, such advertisements would be spam, since the recipient never asked ("opted in") to receive them.&lt;ref name="Optedin"&gt;{{cite journal | first = | last = | title =http://www.mail-abuse.com/an_listmgntgdlines.html| year = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data privacy laws may prohibit a business from disclosing names, email addresses, or other [[Personally identifiable information|personal information]] about customers to a third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Existing Privacy Laws Already Regulate Information Sharing|url=http://www.aba.com/Issues/Pages/GR_PR_Existing.aspx|website=aba.com|publisher=American Bankers Association|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of personal data|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/|website=ec.europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2007 a spate of emails with the subject line "You've received a postcard from a family member!" and other similar subjects, was seen making their way across the internet. Unfortunately most of these emails contained links to malicious web sites where [[JavaScript]] was used to exploit the browser in order to compromise a system, or contained a link to a [[malware]] file masquerading as an E-card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=3063 |title = Riding out yet Another Storm Wave  |publisher = SANS |date = 2007-06-28 |accessdate = 2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hallmark.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/hallmark.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=172&amp;p_created=985648197&amp;p_sid=c61AXd8j&amp;p_accessibility=0&amp;p_redirect=&amp;p_lva=&amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPSZwX3NvcnRfYnk9JnBfZ3JpZHNvcnQ9JnBfcm93X2NudD0yNjQmcF9wcm9kcz0mcF9jYXRzPSZwX3B2PSZwX2N2PSZwX3NlYXJjaF90eXBlPWFuc3dlcnMuc2VhcmNoX25sJnBfcGFnZT0x&amp;p_li=&amp;p_topview=1 |title=Hallmark on malware-ridden E-cards |publisher=Hallmark.custhelp.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Express Entry''' is a system used by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] to manage applications for [[Permanent residency in Canada|Canadian permanent residence]] through certain economic immigration programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/express-entry-system-immigrants.html|title=Express Entry System - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Express Entry system is used to manage applications for skilled and qualified workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/express-entry-what-prospective-candidates-need-know.html|title=Express Entry: What prospective candidates need to know - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Express Entry is designed to facilitate the immigration of skilled workers to Canada "who are most likely to succeed economically."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/express-entry-what-prospective-candidates-need-know.html|title=Express Entry: What prospective candidates need to know - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system boasts efficient processing times, with 80% of applications processed in 6 months or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/express-entry-system-immigrants.html|title=Express Entry System - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic value versus "first-come first-served" ==
Express Entry replaced the original "first-come first-served" immigration selection system. Express Entry was expected to be more responsive to regional labour shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lotf Ali|first=Jan Ali|date=October 2014|title=Welcome to Canada? A Critical Review and Assessment of Canada’s Fast-Changing Immigration Policies|url=http://www.torontolip.org/Portals/0/Resources/Settlement%20Services/Welcome%20to%20Canada_A%20Critical%20Review%20of%20Changing%20Immigration%20Policies.pdf|journal=Ryerson Centre for Immigration &amp; Settlement|volume=|pages=18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It systemically favours qualified immigrants by prioritising such individuals and avoids the arbitrary selections of the previous system which, in some cases, were based on a first come basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibbitson|first=John|date=December 2014|title=Bootstrap Immigrants: Assessing the Conservative Transformation of Canada's Immigration Policy|url=https://www.cigionline.org/publications/bootstrap-immigrants-assessing-conservative-transformation-canadas-immigration-policy|journal=Centre for International Governance Innovation|volume=|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/18/news/donald-trump-move-to-canada/index.html|title=Want to move to Canada? Here's what you need to know|last=Wattles|first=Jackie|date=18 March 2016|work=CNN Money|access-date=6 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Colin Singer, an immigration lawyer, the ideal candidate for Express Entry is "someone in their 20s that's very proficient in one of Canada's official languages [English and French], and is highly educated, likely at a master's [degree] level."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/18/news/donald-trump-move-to-canada/index.html|title=Want to move to Canada? Here's what you need to know|last=Wattles|first=Jackie|date=18 March 2016|work=CNN Money|access-date=6 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have also been expressed about the Express Entry system. Morton Beiser and Harald Bauder (2014) of Ryerson University wrote "Canada’s once pathbreaking immigration policies are being transformed into a system that mainly serves employers, treating immigrants not as future citizens or members of Canadian communities and families but merely as convenient or cheap labour." Others{{Who|date=November 2018}} fear that Express Entry gives too much power to politicians and bureaucrats. Advocates of Express Entry claim that Express Entry can reduce the number of migrants who fail to get work by better fitting immigrants to existing jobs vacancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibbitson|first=John|date=December 2014|title=Bootstrap Immigrants: Assessing the Conservative Transformation of Canada's Immigration Policy|url=https://www.cigionline.org/publications/bootstrap-immigrants-assessing-conservative-transformation-canadas-immigration-policy|journal=Centre for International Governance Innovation|volume=|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The system ==
The total amount of immigrants invited depends on the quota the Canadian government has set for itself. For 2018 the quota set is 310,000 immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3836805/340k-immigrants-per-year-by-2020-government-unveils-new-immigration-targets/|title=Canadian government wants 310,000 immigrants in 2018, 340,000 a year by 2020|last=Scotti|first=Monique|date=1 November 2017|work=Global News|access-date=6 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quota is then reached by skimming from the top of the express entry pool and inviting the highest ranking candidates. For example, on February 7, 2018, the quota was 3,000 immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cicnews.com/2018/02/new-express-entry-draw-invites-3000-candidates-to-apply-for-canadian-permanent-residence-0210224.html#gs.diYKa78|title=New Express Entry draw invites 3,000 candidates to apply for Canadian permanent residence|last=Smith, Katem and Turner|first=Stephen Eman and Noah|date=21 February 2018|work=CANADA IMMIGRATION NEWSLETTER|access-date=5 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the top-ranked 3,000 individuals were invited. In the past{{When|date=November 2018}} the government has repeated this draw multiple times per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/become-candidate/rounds-invitations/results-previous.html|title=Express Entry results: Previous rounds of invitations|last=|first=|date=|website=www.canada.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fates''' were a common motif in European [[polytheism]], most frequently represented as a group of three mythological goddesses (although their number differed in certain eras and cultures). They were often depicted as weavers of a [[tapestry]] on a [[loom]], with the tapestry dictating the destinies of men. The primary instances include:

*[[Moirai]], the Fates of Greek mythology who control the Threads of Fate
*[[Parcae]], the Fates of Roman mythology
*[[Deities and fairies of fate in Slavic mythology]]
*[[Norns]], the Fates of Norse mythology, also related to other female deities in Germanic paganism
*[[List of Lithuanian mythological figures#Gods|Deivės Valdytojos]], seven goddesses who weave garments made from humans' lives in Baltic paganism

This motif has been replicated in fictional accounts, such as:

*[[Three Witches]], characters in Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]''

*[[List of Disney's Hercules characters#Other_Greek_myths|The Fates]], characters in Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]''

*The Fates/Moirai, characters in Rick Riordan's ''Percy Jackson and the Olympians'' series, ''Heroes of Olympus'' series, and ''The Trials of Apollo'' series

*The Sisters of Fate, characters in the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' video game series, based on the Greek Fates
*The Fates, characters in Anaïs Mitchell's ''[[Hadestown (musical)|Hadestown]]''

'''Functional Requirements for Authority Data''' ('''FRAD'''), formerly known as '''Functional Requirements for Authority Records''' ('''FRAR''') is a conceptual [[entity-relationship model]] developed by the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) for relating the data that are recorded in library [[Authority control|authority records]] to the needs of the users of those records and facilitate and sharing of that data.

The draft was presented in 2004 at the 70th IFLA General Conference and Council in [[Buenos Aires]] by Glenn Patton. It is an extension and expansion to the [[Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records|FRBR]] model, adding numerous entities and attributes.

The conceptual work and future implementations are aimed at supporting four tasks, frequently executed by users in a library context -- either the library patrons (the first three tasks), or the librarians themselves (all four tasks):

* '''Find''': Find an entity or set of entities corresponding to stated criteria;
* '''Identify''': Identify an entity;
* '''Contextualize''': Place a person, corporate body, work, etc. in context;
* '''Justify''': Document the authority record creator’s reason for choosing the name or form of name on which an access point is based.

Next to the development of FRAR, the Working Group on Functional Requirements and Numbering of Authority Records (FRANAR) is also charged to study the feasibility of an [[International Standard Authority Data Number]] (ISADN) and serve as the official IFLA liaison to and work with other interested groups concerning authority files.

'''Giuseppe Bergman''' is the [[Candide]]-like [[protagonist]] of the works of Italian [[cartoonist]] [[Milo Manara]].  The anti-heroic Italian youth stars in four [[graphic novel]]s ([[comic books]]) which are an ironic [[deconstruction]] of adventure stories and comic books as a medium.

The first adventure, later collected for publication as ''HP et Giuseppe Bergman'' (''The Great Adventure'' in Catalan’s English translation), was originally serialized in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[À Suivre]]'' beginning in 1978.  Giuseppe Bergman appears as a dissatisfied 20-something longing for adventure.  Seeking it, he responds to the advertisement of a mysterious company which sends him to HP, "the adventure master”: a caricature of and homage to famed Italian cartoonist [[Hugo Pratt]].  Bergman finds himself confronted by hoodlums, rioters, white slavers, drug addicts, revolutionaries, and natives, but his adventures are bumbling disasters as he is consistently unprepared for the situations he encounters.  In later adventures, collected in the graphic novels ''An Author in Search of Six Characters'', ''Dies Irae'', ''Perchance to Dream'', and ''To See the Stars'', Bergman’s frustrating adventures take him through Africa, India, and the world of European art.  Themes of art and [[illusion]], fantasy and frustration, [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] and [[human nature]] run through the stories.

Milo Manara is best known for his erotic work.  This is an aspect of the Bergman stories which, while originally making an intellectual point, gradually comes to take over the series as a whole.

'''Glasmuseet Ebeltoft''' is a museum in [[Ebeltoft]], [[Denmark]]. It is dedicated to the exhibition and collection of contemporary glass art worldwide. 

==Establishment==
The museum was founded in 1985 by Danish glass artists Finn Lynggaard and Tchai Munch. It is administered by the private Foundation for the Collection of Contemporary International Studio Glass. The museum makes its home in Ebeltofts's former Customs and Excise House; in 2006 a modern wing was added to the original building. In addition to exhibition spaces, the museum has a library, gift shop and cafe that are open to the public. Also in 2006 an enclosed garden and glass-blowing studio were added to the complex. The glass studio presents glass working demonstrations to the public and seminars for students of glass.

==Exhibitions==
The museum presents four to six exhibitions per year that focus on contemporary glass art. It shows experimental work by young artists in group and solo shows, as well as new work by well-established artists. Organized by museum staff, the exhibitions often include catalogs that are printed in several languages for the benefit of an international audience. Glasmuseet Ebeltoft often loans the exhibitions it creates to museums in other countries. In the past these countries have included China, England, Finland, Germany and the United States.

==Collections==
Glasmuseet Ebeltoft’s collection contains 1500 objects by 600 artists.  Its holdings are composed of donations and loans of art works, obtained in most cases directly from the artists whose work is desired by the museum. The museum’s collection is most unusual in that artists who have been invited to be represented in it are permitted to exchange or supplement their works in the collection with new pieces.

Artists represented by work in the collection include Klaus Moje and Nick Mount of Australia; Louis Leloup of Belgium; Václav Ciglar, [[František Janák]], Jiří Harcuba, Pavel Hlava, [[Stanislav Libenský/Jaroslava Brychtová|Stanislav Libenský and Jaroslava Brychtová]] and René Roubíček of the Czech Republic; Eva Engström, Finn Lynggaard and Tchai Munch of Denmark; [[Ivo Lill]] of Estonia; [[Erwin Eisch]], Ursula Merker, Gerhard Ribka, Kurt Wallstab and Ann Wolff of Germany; Ursula Huber-Peer, Pino Signoretto, [[Bruno Pedrosa]] and [[Lino Tagliapietra]] of Italy; Durk Valkema and [[Sybren Valkema]] of the Netherlands; Anna Carlgren, Gunnar Cyrén, Eva Englund, Göran Wärff and Ulrica Hydman-Vallien of Sweden, [[Charles Bray (glass artist)|Charles Bray]] and [[David Reekie]] of the United Kingdom; and Rick Beck, Gary Beecham, William Bernstein, Katharine Bernstein, [[Nicole Chesney]], [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Fritz Dreisbach]], [[Shane Fero]], [[Robert C. Fritz|Robert Fritz]], [[Michael Glancy]], Richard Jolley, Jon Kuhn, [[Marvin Lipofsky]], [[Harvey Littleton]], [[John Littleton/Kate Vogel]], [[Dante Marioni]], [[Richard Marquis]], Joel Philip Myers, Mary Shaffer, [[Paul Joseph Stankard|Paul Stankard]], [[Michael Taylor (Glass artist)|Michael Taylor]] and Toots Zynsky of the United States.

==Sponsors==
Because it receives no direct financial support from the Danish government, Glassmuseet Ebeltoft relies on sponsorships from Denmark's business community. The museum's three major sponsors are the textile company [[Kvadrat (company)|Kvadrat]], [[Djursland]] Bank and [[NRG Energy|NRGi]] energy company. Other corporate supporters include Primagaz, Montana Møbler, Blue Water Shipping, Cerama and Mois Linien.

Volunteer help is drawn from the museum's "Friends Society", which has about 900 members.

The Global Retirement Index is a composite welfare index which combines at total of 18 target-oriented indicators which are grouped into four thematic categories to calculate the position on the index. The indicators are then used to create a percentage score; countries are ranked by the score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-19/the-u-s-falls-in-a-global-retirement-security-ranking |title= The U.S. Falls in a Global Retirement Security Ranking |last=Wooley |first=Suzanne |date=19 July 2017 |website=Bloomberg |publisher= |access-date= 1 September 2017 |quote=}}

"'''Hey Kid, Catch!'''" was a [[television advertisement|television commercial]] for [[Coca-Cola]] starring [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] defensive tackle [[Joe Greene|"Mean" Joe Greene]].   The commercial debuted on October 1, 1979, and was re-aired multiple times, most notably during [[Super Bowl XIV]] in 1980. The 60-second commercial won a [[Clio Award]] for being one of the best television commercials of 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-10-best-award-winning-tv-ads-everyone-must-see-2011-1?op=1|title=The 10 Best Award-Winning TV Ads Everyone Must See|date=January 18, 2011|website=Business Insider|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its planning and filming stages, [[McCann Erickson]], the advertising agency that created the commercial, used the working title "Mean Joe Greene".  The commercial was a part of Coca-Cola's "Have a Coke and a Smile" ad campaign of the late 1970s.  The commercial's set-up and payoff is classic simple advertising.

==The Commercial==
After sustaining an injury during a football game, Greene is limping alone into the tunnel toward the Steelers' locker room when a young boy (played by Tommy Okon) comes up behind him offering his help, which Greene declines.  After telling Greene that he still thinks he's the best, the boy offers him his bottle of Coke, which Greene refuses at first, but the boy wants him to have it; Greene sheepishly accepts it with thanks and drinks the entire bottle as the boy quietly says "See ya 'round" and slowly walks away.  When Greene finishes the Coke he turns back to the boy and says "Hey, Kid..  Catch,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xffOCZYX6F8|title=Coca-Cola Classic ad: Mean Joe Greene [Full Version] (1979)|date=July 17, 2007|website=YouTube|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; tossing his jersey (slung over his shoulder) to the surprised boy who happily says "Wow!  Thanks, Mean Joe!".  Greene casts a smile toward the boy before continuing his trek to the locker room.

The commercial has been listed as one of the top ads of all time by multiple sources, including ''[[TV Guide]]''. The ad later received worldwide acclaim when it was re-filmed in various countries using indigenous sports figures in each version.  

The campaign's art director was Roger Mosconi, the writer was Penny Hawkey, and the singers of the "Coke and a Smile" jingle were Jim Campbell, Don Thomas, Liz Corrigan, Shellie Littman, Arlene Martell, and [[Linda November]]. The footage was shot in May 1979 at a small stadium in [[Mount Vernon, New York]], and the commercial first aired on October 1, 1979 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', though its airing during Super Bowl XIV in 1980 brought it the most attention due to the program's enormous audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=December 17, 1979|last=Isaacs|first=Stan|title=Mean Joe: Goliath plays Othello|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1126412/1/index.htm|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=At the request of the singers in the audience, Arlene sang "A Coke and a Smile", a classic jingle with Mean Joe Green which has played every year for a decade on ''Super Bowl's Greatest Commercials'', and in 2009 was voted into the Super Bowl Hall of Fame. Singers on the commercial are Jim Campbell, Don Thomas, Liz Corrigan, Shellie Littman, Arlene Martell, and Linda November|title=Singers' Seminar explores steps to success|url=http://www.aftra.org/documents/FALL2010_STAND_FINAL%281%29.pdf|format=pdf|date=Fall 2010|volume=43|number=2|website=[[AFTRA]]|location=New York|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greene later recalled that in filming the commercial, it took several takes to get his final line in the commercial in without burping. "Between me belching and going to the men's room, it took three days to film it," Greene recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fowler|first1=Scott|title=Mean Joe Greene's biggest hit was also his most memorable 'catch'|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-03-01/sports/1992061149_1_joe-greene-okon-coke|accessdate=January 3, 2017|work=Baltimore Sun|date=March 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the commercial was also shown during the 2004 film [[Miracle (2004 film)|Miracle]] when the USA vs. USSR hockey game was on a commercial break.

==Parodies and homages==
*In 1983, the television show "Newhart" paid homage to the commercial in the first season episode "A View from the Bench" when a limping Celtics player throws his basketball shoes to Bob Newhart on his way to the locker room.

* During [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009, Coca-Cola aired a parody to the ad to promote its [[Coca-Cola Zero]] brand, starring former Steelers player [[Troy Polamalu]] in Greene's role. Continuing an ongoing theme in promotion for the beverage, the ad is interrupted by Coca-Cola "brand managers" who accuse Polamalu of "stealing" their commercial, prompting the [[safety (gridiron football position)|safety]] to tackle one of them and give the child their shirt.&lt;ref name=freep-09ads&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinds|first=Julie|title=Super Bowl ads deliver big laughs|url=http://archive.freep.com/article/20090202/ENT03/902020367/Super-Bowl-ads-deliver-big-laughs|website=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=March 20, 2015|date=February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abchron-meanjoezero&gt;{{cite web|title=Coke to reprise 'Mean Joe' commercial for Super Bowl|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2009/01/26/daily11.html|website=Atlanta Business Chronicle|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, an episode of ''[[SportsNation (TV series)|SportsNation]]'' on [[ESPN2]] briefly parodied this commercial which featured sportscaster [[Michelle Beadle]] in Greene's role. In the commercial, after finishing the soda, instead of the jersey, she "accidentally" throws the empty soda bottle back to the child as it breaks on the wall at the end and then apologizes after that "mishap". In addition, the commercial tried to look like the late 70s/early 80s font titles with the words "Facebook.com/SportsNation" and "Have Some ''"SportsNation"'' and a smile" and "Sports is Life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Davis | first=Glenn | url=http://www.sportsgrid/com/real-sport/nfl/videos-espns-Michelle-beadle-shoots-some-super-bowl-commercials/ |title=ESPN'S Michelle Beadle Shoots Some Super Bowl Commercials (Mean Joe Greene is mentioned in the article)| date=January 31, 2011 | accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An advertisement for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television drama series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', first aired during [[Super Bowl XLV]], parodies the original commercial with a similar scene in which Dr. Gregory House, played by [[Hugh Laurie]], throws his cane to a young fan played by [[Preston Bailey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyastorian.com/news/free/article_f4a618f2-2fe8-11e0-a807-001cc4c002e0.html | title=Former Seaside boy set to appear in Super Bowl commercial Sunday | date=February 4, 2011 | website=The Daily Astorian | accessdate=February 7, 2011 | location=Astoria, Oregon | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206235639/http://www.dailyastorian.com/news/free/article_f4a618f2-2fe8-11e0-a807-001cc4c002e0.html | archivedate=February 6, 2011 | df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012, Greene reprised his role in a [[Downy]] Unstopables ad for [[Super Bowl XLVI]] entitled "Stinky", where [[Amy Sedaris]] rejects Greene's jersey because it smelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=McManis | first=Andrew |  url=http://adweeek.com/brand-marketing/cokes-classic-super-bowl-ad-gets-stinky-137882 | title=Coke's Classic Super Bowl Ad Gets 'Stinky' | date=January 31, 2012 | accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5829">'''In-mould labelling''' is the use of paper or plastic [[label]]s during the manufacturing of containers by [[blow molding]], [[injection molding]], or [[thermoforming]] processes. The label serves as the integral part of the final [[Product (business)|product]], which is then delivered as  pre-decorated item.&lt;ref name="Giles"&gt;{{cite book|last=Giles|first=Geoff A.|title=Design and Technology of Packaging Decoration for the Consumer Market|publisher=CRC Press|date=2001|isbn=978-0-8493-0506-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining the decoration process with the [[Molding (process)|moulding process]] cuts the total cost, but can increase the manufacturing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Packaging User's Handbook|author=Frank Albert Paine, Institute of Packaging|publisher= Springer|year= 1991|isbn=075140151X|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology was first developed by [[Owens-Illinois]] in cooperation with [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] to supply pre-labelled bottles that could be filled on the product filling line. This was first applied to [[Head &amp; Shoulders]] shampoo bottles.&lt;ref name="Giles" /&gt;

==Principles==
In-mould labelling (IML) was initially designed for blow molding, though developments using injection molding or thermoforming with reel-fed systems have increased the efficiency of the labelling process. The original concept involves coating the reverse side of the label with a heat seal layer, followed by a [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]] material in which heat resistant ink is applied to. A heat resistant coating of [[lacquer]] is then applied.&lt;ref name="Giles" /&gt; This process eliminates the need to flame treat the bottles prior to labelling in order to achieve adequate adhesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beswick|first=R. Hd|author2=D. J. Dunn|title=Plastics in Packaging: Western Europe and North America|publisher=Rapra Technology|date=2002|isbn=978-1-85957-329-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, paper was used as the label substrate to which the heat reactive adhesive was applied.  In more recent times polyolefin substrates have been employed, such as Polyart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polyart.com/en/applications/tags-and-labels/iml-labels|title=IML Labels (in-mold labelling)|accessdate=December 15, 2017|publisher=Polyart}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Arjobex Synthetic Papers. This creates the advantage that scrap polyethylene and polypropylene bottles produced in the molding process can be recycled, without the need for label removal prior to recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.packageprinting.com/article/synthetic-papers-films-in-mold-label-iml-applications-packaging-bottles-containers-47779/#.WTEam_muiJ4.email|last=Polischuk|first=Tom|title=Be Bold|date=February 1, 2007|accessdate=June 5, 2017|publisher=packagePRINTING}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Labelling===
There are several techniques for conducting the in-mould labelling process. [[Vacuum]] and [[compressed air]] can be used to handle the labels, also [[static electricity]] can be used. Electrostatic charging electrodes charge a label while it is being transferred to the moulding machine, so that when the label is placed on the tool and released by the labelling robot, it will wrap itself onto the tool. Most robot systems for placement of labels are not required for specific moulding machines and can be used with up to date presses with fast clamping systems.&lt;ref name="Giles2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Giles|first=Geoff A.|author2=David R. Bain|title=Technology of Plastics Packaging for the Consumer Market|publisher=CRC Press|date=2001|isbn=978-0-8493-0508-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labels may be [[paper]] or a similar material to the moulded product. [[Polypropylene]] or [[polystyrene]] is commonly used as label material, with a thickness of 15 to 40 micrometres. Cavitated label material is also used. This is a sandwich material, having a spongy layer bonded between two very thin solid layers. An advantage of cavitated film is better conformance to small-[[radius]] curves on a product. [[Laminate]]d film can be used to decorate products, yielding high wear-resistance. This type of film has the printed surface protected by a second layer of film, with a thickness of 30 or 40 micrometres. Products using this type of label might include picnic-ware, mouse-mats, or internal automotive components.

==Use==
In-mould labelling is  a popular method of decorating injection molded parts for consumer electronics and for [[plastic bottle]]s. Notebook computer and cellphone manufacturers are adopting IML technology for greater wear resistance than spray painting or pad-printing. IML can provide greater decorating options than other methods. Multi-color screen printed and offset lithography printed graphics are used to produce products with higher quality graphics than available with other decorating methods.  Most applications in this area use second surface graphics. The decoration is printed on the back side of a clear substrate, typically [[polycarbonate]] or [[Acrylate polymer|acrylic]] 0.125mm to 0.375mm thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic-labels.com/in-mould-labelling.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202041145/http://www.ic-labels.com/in-mould-labelling.html|archivedate=December 2, 2008|title=In Mould Labelling can achieve cost reductions together with outstanding quality of decoration|publisher=IC-labels Ltd. |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injection plastic is on the ink side of the film. This encapsulates the decoration between the film layer and the injected plastic resulting in a decoration that can't be abraded during use. Vision systems can check for accurate label positioning, and can validate label correctness.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
The Institut national de l'audiovisuel was founded in 1975 by a law of 1974 with the purpose of  conserving archives of audiovisual materials, research relating to them and professional training.  In 1992, legal deposit was extended to television and radio, and the institute was to be the depository. This led to the establishment of the ''Inathèque'' in 1995, with the aim of conserving and making its holdings available to researchers and students. It was opened to the public in October 1998, at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale de France - site François-Mitterrand]]. In 2002, legal deposit was extended to cable and satellite television and in 2005 to terrestrial digital television. From September 2006, the institute has been responsible for archiving 17 radio and 45 television services amounting to 300,000 hours per year.

The '''''Jixiao Xinshu''''' ({{zh|t=紀效新書|s=纪效新书|p=Jìxiào xīnshū}}) or '''''New Treatise on Military Efficiency'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a military manual written during the 1560s and 1580s by the [[Ming dynasty]] general [[Qi Jiguang]]. Its primary significance is in advocating for a combined arms approach to warfare using five types of infantry and two type of support. Qi Jiguang separated infantry into five separate categories: firearms, swordsmen, archers with fire arrows, ordinary archers, and spearmen. He split support crews into horse archers and artillery units. The ''Jixiao Xinshu'' is also one of the earliest extant Asian extant texts to address the relevance of [[martial arts]] to military training and warfare. Several contemporary martial arts styles of Qi's era are mentioned in the book, including the staff method of the [[Shaolin temple]].

==Background==

In the late 16th century the military of the Ming dynasty was in poor condition. As the [[Mongol]] forces of [[Altan Khan]] raided the northern frontier, China's coastline fell prey to ''[[wokou]]'' pirates, who were ostensibly Japanese in origin. Qi Jiguang was assigned to the defense of [[Zhejiang]] in 1555, where he created his own standards of military organization, equipment, tactics, training, and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huang|1981|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published his thoughts on military techniques, tactics, and strategies in the ''Jixiao Xinshu'' after achieving several victories in battle.

==Contents==

There are two editions of the ''Jixiao Xinshu''. The first edition was written from 1560-1561 and consists of 18 chapters. It is known as the 18 chapter edition. The second edition, published in 1584 during Qi's forced retirement, included re-edited and new material compiled in 14 chapters. It is known as the 14 chapter edition.

The chapters included in the 18-chapter edition are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|pp=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandarin duck formation==

In the ''Jixiao Xinshu'', Qi Jiguang recommended a 12-man team known as the "mandarin duck formation" ({{zh|c=鴛鴦陣|p=yuānyāng zhèn}}), which consisted of 11 soldiers and one person for logistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huang|1981|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*4 men with long lances (twelve feet or longer) (''chang qiang shou'' 長槍手)
*2 men with sabers and [[rattan shield]]s, one on each side of the lancers (''dun pai shou'' 盾牌手)
*2 men with [[langxian|multiple tip bamboo spears]] (''lang xian shou'' 狼筅手)
*2 men with tridents or swords (''duan bing shou'' 短兵手)
*1 corporal (with the squad flag) (''dui zhang'' 隊長)
*1 cook/porter (logistical personnel) (''fuze huoshi de huobing'' 負責夥食的火兵)

The mandarin duck formation was ideally symmetrical. Excluding the corporal and cook/porter, the ten remaining men could be split into two identical five-man squads. This was so that when Japanese pirates made it past the long lances, the saber-and-shield men formed a protective screen for the vulnerable lancers. In battle, the two saber-and-shield men had different roles. The one on the right would hold the advance position of the squad, while the one on the left was to throw javelins and lure the enemy closer. The two men with multiple tip bamboo spears would entangle the pirates while the lancers attacked them. The trident carriers guarded the flanks and rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huang|1981|pp=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firearms===
After suffering several defeats to pirates, Qi also made a recommendation for a concerted campaign to integrate musket teams into the army, based on their superior range and firepower compared to bows and arrows.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}} Qi became enamored with the musket after his defeats and became one of the primary proponents of their use in the Ming army. He favored it for its accuracy and its ability to penetrate armor.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}}

Ideally an entire musket team would have 10 musketeers, but often had 4 or 2 in practice. The optimal musket formation that Qi proposed was a 12 man musket team similar to the melee mandarin duck formation. However, instead of fighting in a hand to hand formation, they operated on the principle of [[volley fire]], which Qi pioneered prior to the publication of the first edition of the ''Jixiao Xinshu''.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}} The teams could be arranged in a single line, formed two layers deep with five musketeers each, or five layers deep with two muskets per layer. Once the enemy was within range, each layer would fire in succession, and afterwards a unit armed with traditional close combat weapons would move forward ahead of the musketeers. The troops would then enter into melee combat with the enemy together. Alternatively, the musketeers could be placed behind wooden stockades or other fortifications, firing and reloading continuously by turns.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=174}}

Each squad was drilled in coordinated and mutually-supportive combat scenarios with clearly defined roles. Because Qi's troops were recruited from peasant stock, and were not considered the equals of their Japanese foes, Qi Jiguang emphasized the use of combined arms and squad tactics. Units were rewarded or punished collectively: an officer was executed if his entire unit fled the enemy, and if a squad leader was killed in battle, the whole squad would be put to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huang|1981|pp=167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weapons production==

The standard procedure for the procurement of weapons for a commander such as Qi Jiguang was for production quotas to be assigned by provincial officials to each local district under the commander's responsibility. The resulting weapons produced under this system varied widely in quality. Muskets in particular exploded with alarming frequency, leading Qi to eschew reliance on firearms in favor of using melee tools such as swords, rattan shields, and sharpened bamboo poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huang|1981|pp=170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later in his career Qi became a strong proponent of integrating muskets after suffering several defeats to the pirates. Qi's reconsideration of firearms in warfare led to the creation of the first well drilled musket teams in China. Qi was also a pioneer of the musket volley fire technique, which would later be adopted throughout China and Korea. Included in the manual are several passages detailing the usage of muskets, the volley fire technique, and an estimation of the percentage of firearms that would likely fail to fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huang|1981|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manual provides the following description of the forging of swords:

{{cquote|
The following steps in the manufacturing process of the short sword are necessary:
# The material of iron used must be forged many times (that is heated, hammered and folded numerous times).
# The cutting edge must be made from the best steel, free of impurities.
# The entire part of the blade where the back or ridge of the blade joins the cutting edge must be filed so that they appear seamlessly joined together. This process is necessary to enable the sword to cut well.}}

==Unarmed fighting==
The last chapter of the ''Jixiao Xinshu'', the ''Quanjing Jieyao Pian'', covers the subject of unarmed combat. Qi Jiguang regarded unarmed fighting as being useless on the battlefield. However, he recognized its value as a form of basic training to strengthen his troops, improving their physical fitness and confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qi selected thirty-two postures to illustrate, from among the martial arts of the period. The description of the techniques is written in verse, typically with seven characters per line.

In the chapter's introduction, Qi names sixteen different fighting styles, all of which he considered to have been handed down in an incomplete fashion, "some missing the lower part, some missing the upper".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the arts listed is the [[Shaolin kung fu|Shaolin staff method]], which was later documented in detail in Cheng Zongyou's ''Exposition of the Original Shaolin Staff Method'', published around 1610.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Shaolin unarmed fighting techniques are not mentioned. The entire listing of late Ming dynasty martial arts was later copied without attribution by a manual of the Shaolin style, the ''Hand Combat Classic'' (''Quanjing quanfa beiyao''). However, the later manual, with a preface dated to 1784, altered the text, adding a spurious claim that the history of hand combat had originated at the Shaolin Monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qi's discussion of hand-to-hand combat makes no mention of a spiritual element to the martial arts, nor does it allude to breathing or [[qi]] circulation. By contrast, Chinese martial arts texts from the [[Manchu conquest of China|Ming-Qing transition]] onward represent a synthesis of functional martial arts techniques with [[Taoist|Daoist]] ''[[tao yin|daoyin]]'' health practices, breathing exercises, and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lorge|2011|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Qi Jiguang was one of several Ming authors to document the military tactics and martial arts techniques of the era. The earliest known documentation of specific styles of [[Chinese martial arts]] were produced during the late Ming piracy crisis, as scholars and generals such as Qi and his contemporary [[Yu Dayou]] turned their attention to reversing the decline of the Ming military. In the late 16th century, the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]] also spurred great interest in military training methods within the Korean government. Qi Jiguang's writings were of particular interest because of his successful campaigns against Japanese pirates several decades prior. The 14-chapter edition of the ''Jixiao Xinshu'' served as a model for the oldest known extant Korean military manual, the [[Muyejebo]], and was disseminated among Korean military thinkers. During the [[Qing conquest of Ming]], Joseon provided 10,000 musketeers to aid the Ming army in the [[Battle of Sarhu]] and successfully fought the Manchus until their allies were defeated.

In Japan both the 14 and 18 chapter editions were published several times, and some methods from the ''Jixiao Xinshu'' were transferred over to the ''Heiho Hidensho'' (Okugisho), a Japanese strategy book written by [[Yamamoto Kanasuke]] in the 16th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2885">'''Lisa Dennison''' is the chairman of [[Sotheby's]] North and South America. She was previously the director of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City. She became director around 2005, and resigned around 2007 to work at the auction house Sotheby's, where she is now Chairperson.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYArt"/&gt;

==Early life and career==
Dennison grew up in New Jersey&lt;ref name="NYArt"/&gt; and attended [[Wellesley College]], earning a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Art History and French in 1975. She also attended [[Brown University]], receiving a [[Master of Arts]] degree in Art History there in 1978.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

Dennison first worked at the Guggenheim as a summer intern of [[Wellesley College]] in 1973; in 1978 she began working there independently. She worked as an exhibition coordinator, assistant curator, and deputy director and chief curator. In October 2005, she became the director of the museum. At that time, she was also approached by the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] to work as a director there. She replaced seventeen-year director [[Thomas Krens]], who was also the director of the Guggenheim Foundation.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

As director of the Guggenheim, Dennison organized 35 shows, one of which was a traveling exhibition of 125 works in the Guggenheim’s collection.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gugg"/&gt;

Prominent personalities in the 1990s and 2000s such as [[David Hasselhoff]] and [[Mexico]]'s [[Thalia (actress)|Thalia]] (currently based in the U.S.) starred in primetime series such as the ''Las Tres Marias'' trilogy shows (''[[Maria Mercedes (telenovela)|Maria Mercedes]]'', ''[[Marimar (Mexican telenovela)|Marimar]]'' and ''[[Maria la del Barrio]]''), ''[[Rosalinda (telenovela)|Rosalinda]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]'', which were broadcast in about 180 countries and still remained among the world's most-watched non-U.S.-produced television series.

[[Television in the United States|U.S. television programming]] remains one of the most popular forms of entertainment worldwide. This trend was initiated by U.S.-made broadcast network [[soap opera]]s and [[sitcom]]s such as ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Friends]]'' and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' by the mid-2000s, and then in the late 2000s and 2010s by U.S. [[medical drama]]s and [[police procedurals]] such as ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', and the ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' and ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' franchises. All of these are currently [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] in more than 100 countries, and rank among the most-watched television series in the world, extending their dominance to a three-decade span.

In recent decades, the global popularity of U.S. television is rivaled by European television programming and [[Drama (film and television)|television dramas]] from [[Latin America]] and [[Asia]]. The annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]], considered to be one of the world's longest running and most-watched [[reality television]] franchises, annually attracts a peak of 600 million viewers.

Also note these ratings are not comparable with ratings before 2001 due to different methodologies used after this time.

{{further|List of most-watched television broadcasts in Canada}}
The two most-watched television broadcasts in Canadian history occurred during the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver. For the gold medal game of the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament|men's hockey tournament at the 2010 Winter Olympics]], played between the United States and Canada, confirmed 16.6 million Canadians watched the whole game, roughly one-half of the country's entire population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=519476 |title=Olympic final most watched hockey game in 30 years |publisher=NHL |date= 2010-03-01 |accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A groundbreaking 26.5 million Canadians watched some part of the game, over 80 percent of the country's 34-million-person population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2010/03/01/sp-ratings-gold.html |title=Gold medal game huge TV hit on both sides |publisher=CBC |date= 2010-03-01 |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to multiple sources, 13.3 million Canadians watched [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|the games' opening ceremony]], which was the previous record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grohmann |first=Karolos |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61C2GL20100213 |title=Games opening ceremony is most watched TV event in Canada |publisher=Reuters |date= 13 February 2010|accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many believed the final game of the [[1972 Summit Series]] had up to 18 million viewers, but only 4.3 million TVs tuned in. This statistic does not represent the reality that most school children (representing the tail end of the baby-boom i.e. a large population) nationwide watched the game in gymnasiums on only one or two TVs. 10.3 million people watched the ice hockey gold medal final of the 2002 Winter Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2010/12/c9483.html |title=2010 Gold Medal Game Is the Apex of TV Viewing in Canada as Legend of '72 Summit Series Finally Laid to Rest |publisher=Newswire.ca |date= March 2010|accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Note'': The UEFA Euro 2008 final is missing from the list, because the lengthy trophy presentation was included into the official ratings. The game itself was watched by 28.05 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv-tipps.net/3512/tv-einschaltquote-em-finale-knackt-nicht-den-allzeit-rekord/ tv-tipps.net] TV-Einschaltquote: EM-Finale knackt nicht den Allzeit-Rekord (German)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- COMMENTED OUT AS REFERENCES MISSING *''The Scarf'', a thriller series by [[Francis Durbridge]], got up to 89 per cent market share in January 1962. The number of viewers was not measured at that time. The series is still considered the biggest so-called "Straßenfeger" (a television broadcast which is so popular as to leave the streets deserted) in German television history. One year later, the ''Tim Frazer'' series by Durbridge went for a market share between 80 and 93 per cent.--&gt;

===India===

India measures shows through TRP (Television Rating Point). Shows had higher ratings in 2000s versus now. The only show now that scores above just the 3.3 mark is [[Kumkum Bhagya]], and its spin off [[Kundali Bhagya]] along with [[Naagin (2015 TV series)]] all shows produced by the same banner [[Balaji Telefilms]]- ironically 2.5-3.5 TRP was considered an average in the 2000s era of serials. The most-watched channel for years has been [[Star Plus]] , then [[Zee TV]] with major competition from [[Colors (TV channel)|Colors]]. ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'' (1988{{ndash}}1990), the television adaptation of Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', had a share of 97.8% among Indian viewers.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080429193553/http://www.omnimb.ca/info/press/p_20050809.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
Viewership ratings are provided by two companies in South Korea, [[Nielsen Media Research|AGB Nielsen Media Research]] and TNmS. Originally Media Service Korea was the only company providing such information, and it was later acquired by Nielsen Media Research. In 1999 TNS Media Korea also began such service, and later changed its name to TNmS. AGB collects viewership data based on 2050 households, while TNmS has 2000 households with measuring devices. Drama ratings usually vary between the two companies by 2–3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soompi.com/2011/06/21/south-korea-tv-ratings-tns-vs-ac-nielsen/|title=South Korean TV Ratings: TNmS vs. AGB Nielsen|date=2011-06-21|accessdate=2014-09-10|publisher=[[Soompi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]] (29 April 2011) received a total audience peak of 26 million viewers, but this is a combined figure aggregated from the ten different channels that broadcast the ceremony. The highest figures of these were 13.59 million on BBC1, with an extra 4.02 million watching on ITV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/resources/tv-facts/tv-since-1981/2011/events/ |title=TV Since 1981 |publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|BARB]] |accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Most-watched programmes====
The following is a list of most-watched programmes, excluding sporting events and news coverage. The mid-1980s introduction of in-week repeat showings accounts for six of the top ten programmes. On this measure, the 1996 Christmas edition of ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' is the most-watched non-repeated, non-documentary programme of all time in the UK. It is the third most-watched programme of all time on a single channel, after the [[2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony]] and the [[wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips]] in 1973 (see below).

== Personal life ==
As a sign of friendship for meeting her longtime friend The Fabulous Moolah, she called her "Lilian" while Moolah referred to her by Young.&lt;ref name="MaeYoungHallOfFame2008"/&gt; In 1991, Young quit the wrestling business and moved to [[California]] to become a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and take care of her mother, who was sick.&lt;ref name=god8&gt;Ellison, Lillian. ''First Goddess of the Squared Circle'', p.8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; She later renounced her evangelist lifestyle.&lt;ref name=god8/&gt; In 1991, she moved in with The Fabulous Moolah and [[Midget wrestling|midget wrestler]] [[Katie Glass]] at a house in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], an arrangement which lasted until Moolah's death in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/22652130/lillian-ellison|title=Lillian "Fabulous Moolah" Ellison|first=Griffith|last=John "J-Cat"|work=[[Find a Grave]]|date=November 4, 2007|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mae Young Classic ===
{{Main|Mae Young Classic}}
On April 1, 2017, WWE announced that a women's tournament would be taking place in the summer of 2017 at a press conference during the [[WrestleMania 33]] weekend and that there were going to be a total of 32 wrestlers competing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE announces 32-competitor Women's Tournament coming to WWE Network this summer|url=http://www.wwe.com/article/wwe-announces-womens-tournament-this-summer-wwe-network|work=WWE|date=April 1, 2017|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tournament was named after Young as an honour to her and it was exclusively for women from both [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] and the [[independent circuit]], it took place on July 13, and 14, 2017, which aired on the [[WWE Network]] on August 28 (round 1) and September 4 (round 2, quarterfinals, and semifinals), and the final match aired live on September 12, also on the WWE Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE announces Mae Young Classic women's tournament to be held at Full Sail Live July 13 and 14|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/maeyoungclassic/article/wwe-announces-mae-young-classic-womens-tournament|work=WWE|date=May 23, 2017|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finalists of the inaugural tournament were [[Shayna Baszler]] and [[Kairi Hojo|Kairi Sane]], with the winner being Sane on September 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/112260/baszler-versus-sane-wwe-mae-young-classic-finals-report.html?p=1|title=BASZLER VERSUS SANE: WWE MAE YOUNG CLASSIC FINALS REPORT|last=Richard|first=Trionfo|date=September 12, 2017|accessdate=September 13, 2017|work=PWInsider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the tournament turned annual as it was announced a second event for the Mae Young Classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/107409-second-mae-young-classic-first-details/|title=First official details on the second annual Mae Young Classic tournament, tapings in August|first=Namako|last=Jason|work=Wrestleview|date=June 21, 2018|accessdate=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Posthumous honors ===
On January 14, 2014, the exact day of Mae's death, WWE pay tribute to her with a posthumous video which included highlights of her career,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/videos/a-tribute-to-mae-young|title=A tribute to Mae Young|accessdate=July 8, 2017|work=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another one six days later on January 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/videos/in-memory-of-mae-young|title=In memory of Mae Young|accessdate=July 8, 2017|work=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, [[Impact Wrestling|Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] dedicated their live [[Genesis (2014)|Genesis]] episode of ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|Impact Wrestling]]'' to the memory of Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwinsider.com/article/82894/complete-impact-wrestling-genesis-2014-night-one-coverage-a-solid-half-hour-of-talking-to-start-the-show-bully-ray-and-ken-anderson-face-off-in-a-vicious-no-dq-match-a-new-champion-is-crowned-sting-finally-gets-ec3-one-on-one-in-the-ring-and-more.html?p=1|title=COMPLETE IMPACT WRESTLING - GENESIS 2014 NIGHT ONE COVERAGE: A SOLID HALF HOUR OF TALKING TO START THE SHOW, BULLY RAY AND KEN ANDERSON FACE OFF IN A VICIOUS NO DQ MATCH, A NEW CHAMPION IS CROWNED, STING FINALLY GETS EC3 ONE ON ONE IN THE RING, AND MORE|last=Stuart|first=Carapola|date=January 16, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2017|work=PWInsider}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 17, ''SmackDown'' was also dedicated to her memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/82914/wwe-smackdown-report-a-tribute-to-mae-young-punk-versus-the-world-number-contender-determined-.html?p=1|title=WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT: A TRIBUTE TO MAE YOUNG; PUNK VERSUS THE WORLD; NUMBER CONTENDER DETERMINED?|last=Trionfo|first=Richard|date=January 17, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2017|work=PWInsider}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, [[Shine Wrestling|Shine]] [[Shine Wrestling events#Shine 16|16]] dedicated to her a 10 bell memorial salute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/83075/complete-shine-16-report-havok-versus-kay-what-is-the-future-of-valkyrie-after-rain-faces-ivelisse-tag-tournament-announced-for-february-28th-at-shine-17-and-more.html?p=1|title=COMPLETE SHINE 16 REPORT: HAVOK VERSUS KAY; WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF VALKYRIE AFTER RAIN FACES IVELISSE; TAG TOURNAMENT ANNOUNCED FOR FEBRUARY 28TH AT SHINE 17; AND MORE|last=Trionfo|first=Richard|date=January 24, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2017|work=PWInsider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[programming language]]s, '''map''' is the name of a [[higher-order function]] that applies a [[procedural parameter|given function]] to each element of a [[functor]], e.g. a [[list (computing)|list]], returning a list of results in the same order.  It is often called ''apply-to-all'' when considered in [[functional form]].

The concept of a map is not limited to lists: it works for sequential containers, tree-like containers, or even abstract containers such as [[futures and promises]].

==Examples: mapping a list ==

Suppose we have a list of integers &lt;code&gt;[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&lt;/code&gt; and would like to calculate the square of each integer.  To do this, we first define a function to &lt;code&gt;square&lt;/code&gt; a single number (shown here in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
square x = x * x
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Afterwards we may call

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; map square [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

which yields &lt;code&gt;[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]&lt;/code&gt;, demonstrating that &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; has gone through the entire list and applied the function &lt;code&gt;square&lt;/code&gt; to each element.    

=== Visual example ===
Below, you can see a view of each step of the mapping process for a list of integers &lt;code&gt;X = [0, 5, 8, 3, 2, 1]&lt;/code&gt; that we want to map into a new list &lt;code&gt;X'&lt;/code&gt; according to the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x + 1&lt;/math&gt; :

[[File:Mapping-steps-loillibe-new.gif|alt=applying map function processing steps|none|thumb|480x480px|View of processing steps when applying map function on a list]]

The &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; is provided as part of the Haskell's base prelude (i.e. "standard library") and is implemented as:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map _ []       = []
map f (x : xs) = f x : map f xs
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Generalization==

{{see also|Functor|Category theory}}

In Haskell, the [[polymorphic function]] &lt;code&gt;map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]&lt;/code&gt; is generalized to a [[polytypic function]] &lt;code&gt;fmap :: Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b&lt;/code&gt;, which applies to any type belonging the [[functor (category theory)|&lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;]] [[type class]].

The [[type constructor]] of lists &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; can be defined as an instance of the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; type class using the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function from the previous example:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
instance Functor [] where
  fmap = map
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Other examples of &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; instances include trees:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
-- a simple binary tree
data Tree a = Leaf a | Fork (Tree a) (Tree a)

instance Functor Tree where  
  fmap f (Leaf x) = Leaf (f x)
  fmap f (Fork l r) = Fork (fmap f l) (fmap f r)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Mapping over a tree yields:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fmap square (Fork (Fork (Leaf 1) (Leaf 2)) (Fork (Leaf 3) (Leaf 4)))
Fork (Fork (Leaf 1) (Leaf 4)) (Fork (Leaf 9) (Leaf 16))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

For every instance of the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; type class, &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; is [[design by contract|contractually obliged]] to obey the functor laws:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
fmap id      ≡ id              -- identity law
fmap (f . g) ≡ fmap f . fmap g -- composition law
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
where &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; denotes [[function composition (computer science)|function composition]] in Haskell.

Among other uses, this allows defining element-wise operations for various kinds of [[collection (computer science)|collections]].

Moreover, if {{math|''F''}} and {{math|''G''}} are two functors, a [[natural transformation]] is a function of polymorphic type &lt;math&gt;h : \forall T . F(T) \to G(T)&lt;/math&gt; which respects {{math|fmap}}:
: &lt;math&gt;h_Y \circ \operatorname{fmap}(f) = \operatorname{fmap}(f) \circ h_X&lt;/math&gt; for any function &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;.

If the {{math|''h''}} function is defined by [[parametric polymorphism]] as in the type definition above, this specification is always satisfied.

==Optimizations==

The mathematical basis of maps allow for a number of [[Optimization (computer science)|optimizations]]. The composition law ensures that both
* &lt;code&gt;(map f . map g) list&lt;/code&gt; and
* &lt;code&gt;map (f . g) list&lt;/code&gt;
lead to the same result; that is, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{map}(f) \circ \operatorname{map}(g) = \operatorname{map}(f \circ g)&lt;/math&gt;.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} However, the second form is more efficient to compute than the first form, because each &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; requires rebuilding an entire list from scratch. Therefore, compilers will attempt to transform the first form into the second; this type of optimization is known as ''map fusion'' and is the [[functional programming|functional]] analog of [[loop fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2007/02/10/map-fusion-and-haskell-performance "Map fusion: Making Haskell 225% faster"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Map functions can be and often are defined in terms of a [[Fold (higher-order function)|fold]] such as &lt;code&gt;foldr&lt;/code&gt;, which means one can do a ''map-fold fusion'': &lt;code&gt;foldr f z . map g&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;foldr (f . g) z&lt;/code&gt;.

The implementation of map above on singly linked lists is not [[tail recursion|tail-recursive]], so it may build up a lot of frames on the stack when called with a large list. Many languages alternately provide a "reverse map" function, which is equivalent to reversing a mapped list, but is tail-recursive. Here is an implementation which utilizes the [[fold (higher-order function)|fold]]-left function.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
reverseMap f = foldl (\ys x -&gt; f x : ys) []
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Since reversing a singly linked list is also tail-recursive, reverse and reverse-map can be composed to perform normal map in a tail-recursive way.

==Language comparison==

The map function originated in [[functional programming]] languages.

The language [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] introduced a map function called &lt;code&gt;maplist&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/MIT/LISP_Prog_Man-Mar_1959.pdf/view J. McCarthy, K. Maling, S. Russell, N. Rochester, S. Goldberg, J. Slagle. LISP Programmer's Manual. March-April, 1959]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1959, with slightly different versions already appearing in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/MIT/AIM-004.pdf/view J. McCarthy: Symbol Manipulating Language - Revisions of the Language. AI Memo No. 4, October 1958]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the original definition for &lt;code&gt;maplist&lt;/code&gt;, mapping a function over successive rest lists:

&lt;pre&gt;
maplist[x;f] = [null[x] -&gt; NIL;T -&gt; cons[f[x];maplist[cdr[x];f]]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;maplist&lt;/code&gt; is still available in newer Lisps like [[Common Lisp]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_mapc_.htm Function MAPC, MAPCAR, MAPCAN, MAPL, MAPLIST, MAPCON in ANSI Common Lisp]&lt;/ref&gt; though functions like &lt;code&gt;mapcar&lt;/code&gt; or the more generic &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; would be preferred.

Squaring the elements of a list using &lt;code&gt;maplist&lt;/code&gt; would be written in [[S-expression]] notation like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="lisp"&gt;
(maplist (lambda (l) (sqr (car l))) '(1 2 3 4 5))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Using the function &lt;code&gt;mapcar&lt;/code&gt;, above example would be written like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="lisp"&gt;
(mapcar (function sqr) '(1 2 3 4 5))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Today mapping functions are supported (or may be defined) in many [[procedural programming|procedural]], [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], and [[multi-paradigm]] languages as well: In [[C++]]'s [[Standard Template Library]], it is called &lt;code&gt;std::transform&lt;/code&gt;, in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (3.0)'s LINQ library, it is provided as an extension method called &lt;code&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt;. Map is also a frequently used operation in high level languages such as [[ColdFusion Markup Language]] (CFML), [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]; the operation is called &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; in all four of these languages. A &lt;code&gt;collect&lt;/code&gt; alias for &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; is also provided in Ruby (from [[Smalltalk]]). [[Common Lisp]] provides a family of map-like functions; the one corresponding to the behavior described here is called &lt;code&gt;mapcar&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;-car&lt;/code&gt; indicating access using the [[CAR and CDR|CAR operation]]). There are also languages with syntactic constructs providing the same functionality as the map function.

Map is sometimes generalized to accept dyadic (2-argument) functions that can apply a user-supplied function to corresponding elements from two lists. Some languages use special names for this, such as ''map2'' or ''zipWith''. Languages using explicit [[variadic function]]s may have versions of map with variable [[arity]] to support ''variable-arity'' functions. Map with 2 or more lists encounters the issue of handling when the lists are of different lengths. Various languages differ on this. Some raise an exception. Some stop after the length of the shortest list and ignore extra items on the other lists. Some continue on to the length of the longest list, and for the lists that have already ended, pass some placeholder value to the function indicating no value.

In languages which support [[first-class function]]s, &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; may be [[partial application|partially applied]] to ''lift'' a function that works on only one value to an element-wise equivalent that works on an entire container; for example, &lt;code&gt;map square&lt;/code&gt; is a Haskell function which squares each element of a list.

[[File:McMahon–Hussein Letter 25 October 1915.jpg|thumb|The McMahon–Hussein letter of 24 October 1915. [[George Antonius]]&amp;nbsp;– who had been the first to publish the correspondence in full&amp;nbsp;– described this letter as "by far the most important in the whole correspondence, and may perhaps be regarded as the most important international document in the history of the Arab national movement... is still invoked as the main piece of evidence on which the Arabs accuse Great Britain of having broken faith with them."{{sfn|Antonius|1938|p=169}}]]
The '''McMahon–Hussein Correspondence'''{{efn|Also known as the Hussein–McMahon Correspondence}} was a series of letters exchanged during [[World War I]] in which the British government agreed to recognize Arab independence after the war [[quid pro quo|in exchange for]] the [[Sharif of Mecca]] launching the [[Arab Revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Kattan|2009|p=101}}{{sfn|Huneidi|2001|p=65}} The correspondence had a significant impact on Middle Eastern history during and after the war, and a dispute over [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] continued thereafter.{{efn|Kedouri wrote that: “The genesis, and the subsequent official interpretations, of the McMahon-Husayn correspondence are essential to the understanding of a great deal of Middle-Eastern diplomatic history during and after the first world war, as well as of the Palestine dispute in the 1920s and 30s.”{{sfn|Kedouri|2014|p=xiii}}}}

The correspondence comprised ten letters exchanged from July 1915 to March 1916,{{sfn|Kedouri|2014|p=3}}, between [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca]], and [[Lieutenant Colonel (British Army)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Sir Henry McMahon]], [[List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to Egypt|British High Commissioner to Egypt]]. The area of Arab independence was defined to be "in the limits and boundaries proposed by the [[Sherif of Mecca]]", with the exception of "portions of [[Syria (region)|Syria]]" lying to the west of "the districts of [[Damascus]], [[Homs]], [[Hama]] and [[Aleppo]]"; conflicting interpretations of this description was to cause great controversy in subsequent years.

Following the publication of the November 1917 [[Balfour Declaration]], which promised a national home for the Jews in Palestine, and the subsequent leaking of the secret 1916 [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] in which Britain and France proposed to split and occupy parts of the territory, the Sharif and other Arab leaders considered the agreements made in the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence had been violated. Of particular dispute, which continues to the present,{{sfn|Huneidi|2001|pp=65–70}} was the extent of the coastal exclusion.{{sfn|Huneidi|2001|pp=65–70}}{{efn|William Mathew observed that "The issue remains a contentious one in the historical literature (notably in the contrasting analyses of Elie Kedourie, on the exculpatory side, and George Antonius and A. L. Tibawi, on the accusatory), although the evidence for British bad faith seems clear enough."{{sfn|Mathew|2011|pp=26–42}}}} The correspondence "haunted Anglo-Arab relations" for many decades thereafter.{{sfn|Kedouri|2014|p=3}}

In January 1923 unofficial excerpts were published by Joseph N. M. Jeffries in ''[[The Daily Mail]]''{{sfn|Huneidi|2001|p=65}} and copies of the various letters circulated in the Arab press.{{efn|Antonius described this as follows: "In actual fact, the terms of the McMahon Correspondence are known all over the Arab world. Extracts have from time to time been officially published in Mecca by the Sharif Husain himself, and several of the notes have appeared verbatim and in full in Arabic books and newspapers. It is open to any person with a knowledge of Arabic, who can obtain access to the files of defunct Arabic newspapers, to piece the whole of the McMahon notes together; and that work I have done in four years of travel and research, from Cairo to Baghdad and from Aleppo to Jedda."{{sfn|Antonius|1938|p=180}}}} Excerpts were published in the 1937 [[Peel Commission|Peel Commission Report]],{{sfn|Palestine Royal Commission|1937|p= 16–22 (Chap. II.1)}} and the correspondence was first published in full in [[George Antonius]]'s 1938 ''[[The Arab Awakening]]'',{{sfn|Antonius|1938|p=169}} then officially in 1939 as ''[[command paper|Cmd.]] 5957''.{{sfn|McMahon|bin Ali|1939}} In 1964, further documents were declassified.{{sfn|Hurewitz|1979|p=46}}

=== Initial discussions ===

The first documented discussions between the British and the [[Banu Qatada|Sherifian family]] took place in February 1914, five months prior to the outbreak of [[World War I]], between [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], then Consul-General in Egypt, and [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah bin al-Hussein]], the second son of [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]], [[Sharif of Mecca]].{{sfn|Yesilyurt|2006|p=106-107}} Hussein had grown uncomfortable with the newly appointed Ottoman governor in his [[Hejaz Vilayet]], [[Wehib Pasha]], reflecting rising tensions since the 1908 completion of the [[Hejaz railway]] which threatened to support increased Ottoman centralization in the region. Discussions eventually culminated in a telegram of 1 November 1914, from Kitchener (recently appointed as Secretary of War) to Hussein wherein Great Britain would, in exchange for support from the Arabs of Hejaz: “...guarantee the independence, rights and privileges of the Sharifate against all external foreign aggression, in particular that of the Ottomans.”{{sfn|Yesilyurt|2006|p=107-108}} The Sharif indicated that he could not break with the Ottomans immediately. However, the entry of the Ottomans on Germany's side in World War I on 11 November 1914 brought about an abrupt shift in British political interests concerning an Arab revolt against the Ottomans.{{sfn|Yesilyurt|2006|p=109-125}} Historian David Charlwood sets out the case for the failure in Gallipoli as leading to an increased desire on the part of the British to negotiate a deal with the Arabs.{{sfn|Charlwood|2014}} Lieshout gives further background on the reasoning behind the shift in British thinking.{{sfn|Lieshout|2009}}

=== Damascus Protocol ===
{{main|Damascus Protocol}}

On 23 May 1915, [[Emir]] [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal bin Hussein]], the third son of Hussein, was presented with the document that became known as the [[Damascus Protocol]]. Faisal was in Damascus to resume talks with the Arab secret societies [[al-Fatat]] and [[Covenant Society|Al-'Ahd]] that he had met previously in March/April; in the interim he had visited [[Istanbul]] to confront the [[Grand Vizier]] with evidence of an Ottoman plot to depose his father. The document declared that the Arabs would revolt in alliance with the United Kingdom, and in return the UK would recognize the Arab independence in an area running from the 37th parallel near the [[Taurus Mountains]] on the southern border of [[Turkey]], to be bounded in the east by [[Persia]] and the [[Persian Gulf]], in the west by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and in the south by the [[Arabian Sea]].{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=24}}{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=47}}

== Letters, July 1915 to March 1916 ==

Following deliberations at [[Ta'if]] between Hussein and his sons in June 1915, during which Faisal counselled caution, [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali]] argued against rebellion and [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]] advocated action and encouraged his father to enter into correspondence with [[Henry McMahon|Sir Henry McMahon]]; over the period 14 July 1915 to 10 March 1916, a total of ten letters, five from each side, were exchanged between Sir Henry McMahon and Sherif Hussein. McMahon was in contact with [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] throughout, and Grey was to authorise and be ultimately responsible for the correspondence.{{efn|Marian Kent described this as follows: “Under the weight of such authorities and arguments Grey did not object to allowing a more precise British commitment, and authorised McMahon 'to give cordial assurances' along the lines he proposed, 'unless something more precise is required, and in that case you may give it…’…On the question of whether or not McMahon exceeded his authority it has to be concluded that although his letter of 24 October committed Britain so much more in detail, this alarmed the Foreign Office only because it was now being obliged to honor its undertakings and not because these were in any way being misinterpreted. At no other stage did McMahon do other than communicate to the Sherif anything more than that for which he had expressly requested – and received – Foreign Office authority… In the last resort the Foreign Office and its chief, Grey, and to a lesser extent, its permanent, non-political chief, Nicolson, have to bear the responsibility for the policy carried out in their name. And the conclusion that has to be drawn is that on this issue the leadership was poor. Grey let himself be swayed, against his better judgment, and to be carried along by events which he made little effort to dominate or modify. He was, as the discussions of the War Committee on 23 March 1916 show, no less than his colleagues cynical of the arrangements his department had let itself become committed to negotiating. And, what was worse, he did not even properly understand them, as his minute of June 1916 admits, commenting on British undertakings in Mesopotamia about which he did not 'have a clear head’.”{{sfn|Kent|1977|p=446-447}}}}

An oft-quoted excerpt from a private letter sent by McMahon halfway through the eight-month period of the correspondence, on 4 December 1915, has been used by historians as evidence of possible British duplicity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[I do not take] the idea of a future strong united independent Arab State... too seriously... the conditions of Arabia do not and will not for a very long time to come, lend themselves to such a thing... I do not for one moment go to the length of imagining that the present negotiations will go far to shape the future form of Arabia or to either establish our rights or to bind our hands in that country. The situation and its elements are much too nebulous for that. What we have to arrive at now is to tempt the Arab people into the right path, detach them from the enemy and bring them on to our side. This on our part is at present largely a matter of words, and to succeed we must use persuasive terms and abstain from academic haggling over conditions – whether about Baghdad or elsewhere.{{efn|Letter from McMahon to Hardinge, 4 December 1915, Hardinge Papers, vol. 94; quoted in {{sfn|Kedouri|2014|p=120}} and {{sfn|Lieshout|2016|p=88}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Minutes of the Paris Peace Conference 1919 Council of the Four p7.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|Minutes of the Paris Peace Conference 1919. The correspondence was described by [[David Lloyd George]] as "the Treaty with the Arabs"]]

[[Elie Kedourie]] says that the October letter was not a treaty, and even if it were considered to be a treaty, Hussein completely failed to fulfill his promises from his 18 February 1916 letter.{{sfn|Kedouri|2014|p=246}}
Arguing to the contrary, Victor Kattan firstly describes the correspondence as a "secret treaty" and references [https://books.google.es/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=8yRLAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=McMahon The Secret Treaties of History] that includes the correspondence. He further argues that Her Majesty’s Government considered it to be a treaty during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference negotiations with the French over the disposition of Ottoman territory.{{sfn|Kattan|2009|p=98}}

== Arab Revolt, June 1916 to October 1918 ==
{{Main article|Arab Revolt}}

McMahon's promises were seen by the Arabs as a formal agreement between them and the United Kingdom. Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour represented the agreement as a treaty during the post war deliberations of [[The Big Four (World War I)|the Council of Four]].{{sfn|Council of Four|1919|p=7}}{{sfn|Kattan|2009|p=98}} On this understanding the Arabs established a military force under the command of Hussein's son Faisal which fought, with inspiration from [[T. E. Lawrence|T. E. Lawrence ("Lawrence of Arabia")]], against the Ottoman Empire during the [[Arab Revolt]].{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=48}} In an intelligence memo written in January 1916 Lawrence described the Arab Revolt as
&lt;blockquote&gt;beneficial to us, because it marches with our immediate aims, the break up of the Islamic 'bloc' and the defeat and disruption of the Ottoman Empire, and because ''the states [Sharif Hussein] would set up to succeed the Turks would be … harmless to ourselves'' … The Arabs are even less stable than the Turks. ''If properly handled they would remain in a state of political mosaic, a tissue of small jealous principalities incapable of cohesion'' (emphasis in original).{{sfn|Hawa|2017|p=155}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Arab Revolt began in June 1916, when an Arab army of around 70,000 men moved against Ottoman forces. They participated in the capture of [[Aqaba]]h and the severing of the [[Hejaz railway]], a vital strategic link through the Arab peninsula which ran from Damascus to [[Medina]]. This enabled the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] under the command of [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] to advance into the Ottoman territories of Palestine and Syria. The British advance culminated in the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918 and the [[Armistice of Mudros|capitulation of the Ottoman Empire]] on 31 October 1918.{{sfn|Goren|Dolev|Sheffy|2014|p=110-114}}

The Arab revolt is seen by historians as the first organized movement of Arab nationalism. It brought together different Arab groups for the first time with the common goal to fight for independence from the Ottoman Empire. Much of the history of Arabic independence stemmed from the revolt beginning with the kingdom founded by Hussein. After the war was over, the Arab revolt had implications. Groups of people were put into classes based on if they had fought in the revolt or not and what their rank was. In Iraq, a group of Sharifian Officers from the Arab Revolt formed a political party which they were head of. Still to this day the Hashemite kingdom in Jordan is influenced by the actions of Arab leaders in the revolt.{{sfn|Khalidi|1991|p=7}}

== Related commitments, May 1916 to November 1918 ==

=== Sykes–Picot Agreement ===
{{Main article|Sykes–Picot Agreement}}

The Sykes–Picot Agreement between Britain, France and Russia of May 1916 was exposed in December 1917 (made public by the [[Bolshevik]]s after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]) showing that the countries were planning to split and occupy parts of the promised Arab country. Hussein was satisfied by [[Bassett Letter|two disingenuous telegrams]] from Sir [[Reginald Wingate]], who had replaced McMahon as High Commissioner of Egypt, assuring him that the British commitments to the Arabs were still valid and that the Sykes–Picot Agreement was not a formal treaty.{{sfn|Khouri|1985}}
After the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] was published by the [[Bolshevik]] Russian government in November 1917, McMahon resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D7730874|title= CAB 24/271/3 Palestine: Policy of His Majesty's Government.|last= Ormsby-Gore |first= William|date= |website= The National Archives|quote= ...the Sykes-Picot agreement, a document which caused the resignation of Sir Henry McMahon himself,...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sources contend that Sykes-Picot conflicted with the Hussein–McMahon Correspondence of 1915–1916. There were several points of difference, the most obvious being Iraq placed in the British area and less obviously, the idea that British and French advisors would be in control of the area designated as being for an Arab State. Lastly, while the correspondence made no mention of Palestine, Haifa and Acre were to be British and a reduced Palestine area to be internationalised.{{sfn|Yapp|1987|p = 281–2}}

=== Balfour Declaration ===
{{Main article|Balfour Declaration}}

In 1917 Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, promising to support the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine.{{sfn|Goren|Dolev|Sheffy|2014|p=280–282}} The declaration and the correspondence (as well as the Sykes-Picot agreement) are frequently considered together by historians because of the potential, real or imagined, for incompatibility between them, particularly in regard to the disposition of Palestine.{{sfn|Shlaim|2009|pp=251–270}} In the words of Professor [[Albert Hourani]], founder of the Middle East Centre at [[St Antony's College, Oxford]]: "The argument about the interpretation of these agreements is one which is impossible to end, because they were intended to bear more than one interpretation."{{sfn|Hourani|1981|p=211}}

=== Hogarth message ===
{{main|Hogarth message}}

Hussein asked for an explanation of the Balfour Declaration and in January 1918 Commander [[David George Hogarth|David Hogarth]], head of the [[Arab Bureau]] in Cairo, was dispatched to [[Jeddah]] to deliver a letter written by Sir [[Mark Sykes]] on behalf of the British Government to Hussein (now King of [[Hejaz]]). The Hogarth message assured Hussein that "the Arab race shall be given full opportunity of once again forming a nation in the world" and referred to "...the freedom of the existing population both economic and political,...". Friedman and Kedourie argue that Hussein accepted the Balfour Declaration {{sfn|Friedman|2000|p=328}}{{sfn|Kedouri|2014|p=257}} while Charles D. Smith argues that both Friedman and Kedourie misrepresent documents and violate scholarly standards in order to reach their conclusions.{{sfn|Smith|1993|p=53-55}} Hogarth reported that Hussein "would not accept an independent Jewish State in Palestine, nor was I instructed to warn him that such a state was contemplated by Great Britain".{{sfn|Huneidi|2001|p=66}}

=== Declaration to the Seven ===
{{Main article|Declaration to the Seven}}

In light of the existing McMahon–Hussein correspondence, but in the wake of the seemingly competing Balfour Declaration for the Zionists, as well as the publication weeks later by the [[Bolshevik]]s of the older and previously secret Sykes–Picot Agreement with the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] and French, seven [[Syria]]n notables in Cairo, from the newly formed Syrian Party of Unity (Hizb al-Ittibad as-Suri), issued a memorandum requesting some clarification from the British Government, including a "guarantee of the ultimate independence of [[Arabia]]". In response, issued on 16 June 1918, the Declaration to the Seven, stated the British policy that the future government of the regions of the [[Ottoman Empire]] occupied by [[Allies of World War I|Allied forces]] in [[World War I]] should be based on the [[consent of the governed]].{{sfn|Friedman|2000|p=195–197}}{{sfn|Choueiri|2001|p=149}}

=== Allenby's assurance to Faisal ===
On 19 October 1918, General Allenby reported to the British Government that he had given Faisal,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
official assurance that whatever measures might be taken during the period of military administration they were purely provisional and could not be allowed to prejudice the final settlement by the peace conference, at which no doubt the Arabs would have a representative. I added that the instructions to the military governors would preclude their mixing in political affairs, and that I should remove them if I found any of them contravening these orders. I reminded the Amir Faisal that the Allies were in honour bound to endeavour to reach a settlement in accordance with the wishes of the peoples concerned and urged him to place his trust whole-heartedly in their good faith.{{sfn|Arab-British Committee|1939|p=Annex H}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Anglo-French Declaration of 1918 ===
{{Main article|Anglo-French Declaration}}

In the Anglo-French Declaration of 7 November 1918 the two governments stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The object aimed at by France and the United Kingdom in prosecuting in the East the War let loose by the ambition of Germany is the complete and definite emancipation of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks and the establishment of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the initiative and free choice of the indigenous populations.{{sfn|Arab-British Committee|1939|p=Annex I}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to civil servant [[Eyre Crowe]] who saw the original draft of the Declaration, "we had issued a definite statement against annexation in order (1) to quiet the Arabs and (2) to prevent the French annexing any part of Syria".{{sfn|Hughes|2013|p=116-117}} The Declaration is considered by historians to have been misleading at best.{{efn|Paris wrote: "The  Anglo-French Declaration has  been described as ‘a  piece  of humbug as sickening as it  was false’. Clearly, neither  Britain  nor  France had  the slightest  intention  of establishing  ‘national governments’  based  on  free  choice;  they  intended  to  control Mesopotamia  and Syria plain  and  simple.  But the Declaration was met  with  rejoicing  in  the Middle East, as  Arabs fixed on  the latter  phrases and chose  to ignore the caveat that the Allies would  provide  ‘support’  and ‘adequate assistance’.  This  was the hook, subtle and oblique,  that would  enable continued Anglo-French  rule in  the region. At a minimum, the Declaration  was  misleading."{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=48}}}}

== Post-War outcome, 1919 to 1921 ==

At the centre, from left to right: [[Rustum Haidar]], [[Nuri as-Said]], Prince Faisal, Captain Pisani (behind Faisal), [[T. E. Lawrence]] (known as "Lawrence of Arabia"), unknown, Captain [[Tahsin Qadri]].]]

Just one day before the end of the war with the Ottomans, the British Foreign Office discussed T.E. Lawrence’s “Sherifian Plan”, in which Hussein’s sons were proposed as [[puppet monarch]]s in Syria and Mesopotamia.{{efn|Paris wrote: "At the 29 October meeting of the Eastern Committee Lawrence advanced his plan for the post-war East... Lawrence’s  plan—the first proposal for a Sherifian solution for the post-war East—was supported  by  the Foreign  Office,  but  roundly  criticized  by  the  India Office, which  denounced ‘King Husain and his scheming sons’... Primary responsibility for the adoption of a Sherifian solution for Mesopotamia can be attributed to two men, Churchill and Lawrence. Churchill was no expert in Middle Eastern matters. He admitted as much. His knowledge, such as it was, came from his advisers, chiefly Lawrence and Young, both proponents of the Sherifian plan... Lawrence  conceived the  Sherifian plan  and was  its greatest promoter  after  the war. From October 1918, when he first proposed Hashemite  rule before the Eastern  Committee, until August  1921, when  Faisal  was crowned in  Baghdad, he was relentless  in his  support  of  Faisal, first  for  Syria  and then  for Mesopotamia."{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=49-50, 138; cites EC,  37th  Minutes, 29  October  1918, [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C4210261 CAB 27/24], pp. 148–52.}}}} Part of the rationale was to satisfy a belief amongst the British public that a debt was owed to the Hashemites under the McMahon correspondence.{{efn|Paris wrote: "The choice of a Hashemite prince for Mesopotamia had much to recommend it from both the British and Arab standpoints. For Britain, the selection of a Hashemite would satisfy many at home who believed Britain owed a debt to the Sherif for his wartime alliance with the Entente, an alliance which undercut the Sultan's call for jihad and helped win the war in the East. True, McMahon did not promise Hashemite rule in Baghdad, and even his acknowledgement of eventual Arab rule was qualified by the stipulation that Britain would implement 'special administrative arrangements' in Mesopotamia. But the sense, the palpable feeling, that Britain owed a debt to its Hashemite allies was real enough, and found frequent expression in press and Parliament in 1919–20."{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=134}}}} Of Hussein’s sons, Faisal was Lawrence’s clear favorite,{{efn|Paris wrote: "In very large measure this unanimity of opinion was due to the efforts of Lawrence. He may have harboured private reservations concerning Faisal, but in public, Lawrence was the Amir's most avid and influential supporter. He was responsible for Faisal's appearance in Paris as the Arab representative to the Peace Conference. He introduced Faisal to every significant political figure at Versailles. He skilfully exploited his contacts in Whitehall, in the press and in Parliament, all for the purpose of advancing the Amir's cause and removing any barriers to his eventual rule in the Middle East. And he used his own growing fame to inflate Faisal's stature as a war hero. Small wonder the French claimed that Faisal was an 'invention' of Colonel Lawrence."{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=135-136}}}} whilst Ali was not considered a strong leader, Zaid was considered to be too young, and Abdullah was considered to be lazy.{{efn|Paris wrote: "Among the Hashemites the choices were limited. For reasons discussed in Part IV below, no one wanted to extend Husain's de facto rule beyond the Hijaz. Zaid was too young. Ali was thought not to be good leadership material and, in any event, was slated to succeed his father in the Hijaz. Abdullah was the only choice until July 1920, when Faisal was ousted by the French from Syria. Lawrence had recommended Abdullah in October 1918. But he did so only because he thought Faisal was destined to remain in Syria. In fact, Abdullah was not highly regarded. His reputation had plummeted as a result of a wartime performance universally regarded as very poor. The records of the Cabinet, India, Foreign and War Offices disclose a curious repetition of the same pejoratives to describe the Amir: 'indolent', 'lazy', 'idle', 'weak' and 'fond of pleasure' appear repeatedly in official descriptions of Abdullah. And no better proof of the preference for Faisal over Abdullah can be provided than the general and widespread promotion of Faisal for Mesopotamia within days of his expulsion from Syria."{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=135}}}}

The [[Paris Peace Conference 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] was held in 1919 between the allies to agree territorial divisions after the war. The correspondence was primarily relevant to the regions which were to become Palestine, Transjordan, Lebanon, Syria, Mesopotamia (Iraq) and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. At the conference, Prince Faisal, speaking on behalf of King Hussein, did not ask for immediate Arab independence. He recommended an Arab State under a British Mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ernest|last=Marshall|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/02/08/97069904.pdf|title=Desires of Hedjaz Stir Paris Critics|date=8 February 1919|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 1920 Prince Faisal initialed an agreement with French Prime Minister Clemenceau which acknowledged 'the right of the Syrians to unite to govern themselves as an independent nation'.{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=69}} A [[Syrian National Congress|Pan-Syrian Congress]], meeting in Damascus, declared an independent state of Syria on 8 March 1920. The new state included portions of Syria, Palestine, and northern Mesopotamia which had been set aside under the Sykes–Picot Agreement for an independent Arab state, or confederation of states. Faisal was declared the head of State as "King". The April 1920 [[San Remo conference]] was hastily convened in response to Faisal’s declaration. At the conference, the Allied Supreme Council granted the mandates for Palestine and Mesopotamia to Britain, and those for Syria and Lebanon to France.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=68, 173}} The United Kingdom and France both agreed to recognize the provisional independence of Syria and Mesopotamia. Provisional recognition of Palestinian independence was not mentioned. France had decided to govern Syria directly, and took action to enforce the [[French Mandate of Syria]] before the terms had been accepted by the Council of the League of Nations. The French intervened militarily at the [[Battle of Maysalun]] in June 1920, deposing the indigenous Arab government, and removed King Faisal from Damascus in August 1920.{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=67}}

In Palestine, the United Kingdom also appointed a [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|High Commissioner]] and established their own mandatory regime. The January 1919 [[Faisal–Weizmann Agreement]] was a short-lived agreement for Arab–Jewish cooperation on the development of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, which Faisal had mistakenly understood was to be within the Arab Kingdom.{{efn|group=qt|[[Ali Allawi]] explained this as follows: "When Faisal left the meeting with Weizmann to explain his actions to his advisers who were in a nearby suite of offices at the Carlton Hotel, he was met with expressions of shock and disbelief. How could he sign a document that was written by a foreigner in favour of another foreigner in English in a language of which he knew nothing? Faisal replied to his advisers as recorded in [[Awni Abd al-Hadi|‘Awni ‘Abd al-Hadi’s]] memoirs, "You are right to be surprised that I signed such an agreement written in English. But I warrant you that your surprise will disappear when I tell you that I did not sign the agreement before I stipulated in writing that my agreement to sign it was conditional on the acceptance by the British government of a previous note that I had presented to the Foreign Office… [This note] contained the demand for the independence of the Arab lands in Asia, starting from a line that begins in the north at Alexandretta-Diyarbakir and reaching the Indian Ocean in the south. And Palestine, as you know, is within these boundaries… I confirmed in this agreement before signing that I am not responsible for the implementation of anything in the agreement if any modification to my note is allowed""{{sfn|Allawi|2014|p=189}}}} Faisal did treat Palestine differently in his presentation to the Peace Conference on 6 February 1919 saying "Palestine, in consequence of its universal character, be left on one side for the mutual consideration of all parties concerned".{{sfn|Friedman|1973|p=92}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|Arab Memorandum to the Paris Peace Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was never implemented.{{efn|group=qt|Although it was noted by [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine|UNSCOP]] that "To many observers at the time, conclusion of the Feisal-Weizmann Agreement promised well for the future co-operation of Arab and Jew in Palestine."{{sfn|UNSCOP|1947}} and further referring to the 1937 report of the [[Peel Commission|Palestine Royal Commission]] which noted that "Not once since 1919 had any Arab leader said that co-operation with the Jews was even possible" despite expressed hopes to the contrary by British and Zionist representatives.{{sfn|Palestine Royal Commission|1937|p=78}}}} At the same conference, US Secretary of State Lansing had asked Dr. Weizmann if the Jewish national home meant the establishment of an autonomous Jewish government. The head of the Zionist delegation had replied in the negative.{{efn|Weizmann's reply to Lansing was as follows: "Dr. Weizmann replied in the negative. The Zionist organisation did not want an autonomous Jewish Government, but merely to establish in Palestine, under a mandatory Power, an administration, not necessarily Jewish, which would render it possible to send into Palestine 70 to 80,000 Jews annually.The Association would require to have permission at the same time to build Jewish schools, where Hebrew would be taught, and in that way to build up gradually a nationality which would be as Jewish as the French nation was French and the British nation British. Later on, when the Jews formed the large majority, they would be ripe to establish such a Government as would answer to the state of the development of the country and to their ideals"{{sfn|Council of Ten|1919|p=7}}}}

United States Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]] was a member of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace at Paris in 1919. He explained that the system of mandates was simply a device created by the Great Powers to conceal their division of the spoils of war, under the color of international law. If the territories had been ceded directly, the value of the former German and Ottoman territories would have been applied to offset the Allies claims for war reparations. He also explained that [[Jan Smuts]] had been the author of the original concept.{{efn|Lansing wrote: If the advocates of the system intended to avoid through its operation the appearance of taking enemy territory as the spoils of war, it was a subterfuge which deceived no one. It seemed obvious from the very first that the Powers, which under the old practice would have obtained sovereignty over certain conquered territories, would not be denied mandates over those territories. The League of Nations might reserve in the mandate a right of supervision of administration and even of revocation of authority, but that right would be nominal and of little, if any, real value provided the mandatory was one of the Great Powers as it undoubtedly would be. The almost irresistible conclusion is that the protagonists of the theory saw in it a means of clothing the League of Nations with an apparent usefulness which justified the League by making it the guardian of uncivilized and semi-civilized peoples and the international agent to watch over and prevent any deviation from the principle of equality in the commercial and industrial development of the mandated territories.&lt;br&gt;It may appear surprising that the Great Powers so readily gave their support to the new method of obtaining an apparently limited control over the conquered territories, and did not seek to obtain complete sovereignty over them. It is not necessary to look far for a sufficient and very practical reason. If the colonial possessions of Germany had, under the old practice, been divided among the victorious Powers and been ceded to them directly in full sovereignty, Germany might justly have asked that the value of such territorial cessions be applied on any war indemnities to which the Powers were entitled. On the other hand, the League of Nations in the distribution of mandates would presumably do so in the interests of the inhabitants of the colonies and the mandates would be accepted by the Powers as a duty and not to obtain new possessions. Thus under the mandatory system Germany lost her territorial assets, which might have greatly reduced her financial debt to the Allies, while the latter obtained the German colonial possessions without the loss of any of their claims for indemnity. In actual operation the apparent altruism of the mandatory system worked in favor of the selfish and material interests of the Powers which accepted the mandates. And the same may be said of the dismemberment of Turkey. It should not be a matter of surprise, therefore, that the President found little opposition to the adoption of his theory, or, to be more accurate, of the Smuts theory, on the part of the European statesmen.{{sfn|Lansing|1921}}}}

[[File:McMahon letter 'districts'.png|thumb|"Districts" according to the McMahon letter and their administrative category in the Ottoman Empire]]

McMahon's letter to Hussein dated 24 October 1915 declared Britain's willingness to recognize the independence of the Arabs subject to certain exemptions. Note that the original correspondence was conducted in both English and Arabic, such that various slightly differing English translations are extant.

{{quote|
The districts of Mersina and Alexandretta, and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo, cannot be said to be purely Arab, and must on that account be excepted from the proposed limits and boundaries.

With the above modification and without prejudice to our existing treaties concluded with Arab Chiefs, we accept these limits and boundaries, and in regard to the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to interests of her ally France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurance and make the following reply to your letter:

Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;English version quoted in: [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D7731306 Palestine: Legal Arguments Likely to be Advanced by Arab Representatives], Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Halifax), January 1939, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|UK National Archives]], CAB 24/282/19, CP 19 (39)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The correspondence was written first in English before being translated to Arabic and vice versa. Who wrote and translated it is unclear. Kedourie and others have assumed that the likeliest candidate for primary author was Ronald Storrs. In his memoirs, Storrs says that correspondence was prepared by Husayn Ruhi {{sfn|Kalisman|2016|p=67}} and then checked by himself.{{sfn|Storrs|1937|p=168}}

The Arab delegations to the 1939 Conference had objected to certain translations of Arabic to English and the Committee arranged for mutually agreeable translations that would render the English text "free from actual error".{{sfn|Arab-British Committee|1939|p=Para 5}}

==="Portions of Syria" debate===
{{Quote box|width=256px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=
"The consequences of interpreting McMahon's 'wilayahs' as meaning 'Ottoman provinces' are so disconcerting that it was – and, to my mind, still is – difficult to believe that McMahon was intending to use the word in this sense in his letter. This interpretation would force on us a choice between the two following alternative conclusions:&lt;br&gt;
(i) First alternative: McMahon was completely ignorant of Ottoman administrative geography. He did not know that the Ottoman vilayet of Aleppo extended westward to the coast, and he did not know that there were no Ottoman vilayets of Homs and Hama. It seems to me incredible that McMahon can have been as ill-informed as this, and that he would not have taken care to inform himself correctly when he was writing a letter in which he was making very serious commitments on HMG's account.&lt;br&gt;
(ii) Second alternative: McMahon was properly acquainted with Ottoman administrative geography, and was using the word 'wilayahs' equivocally. Apropos of Damascus, he was using it to mean 'Ottoman provinces'; apropos of Homs and Hama, and Aleppo, he was using it to mean 'environs'. This equivocation would have been disingenuous, impolitic, and pointless. I could not, and still cannot, believe that McMahon behaved so irresponsibly"
&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;The documents written by British officials, contesting the interpretation of McMahon's word 'wilayahs' that was made by me and, before me, by the author of the Arab Bureau's ''History'', all date from after the time at which HMG had become sure that Britain had Palestine in her pocket... I do not think that Young's or Childs' or Mr Friedman's interpretation of McMahon's use of the word 'wilayahs' is tenable. After studying Mr Friedman's paper and writing these notes, I am inclined to think that the drafting of this letter was, not disingenuous, but hopelessly muddle-headed. Incompetence is not excusable in transacting serious and responsible public business."
| source=[[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in 1970, in correspondence with Isaiah Friedman{{sfn|Toynbee|Friedman|1970|p=185-201}}}}
The debate regarding Palestine derived from the fact that it is not explicitly mentioned in the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, but is included within the boundaries that were initially proposed by Hussein. McMahon accepted the boundaries of Hussein ''"subject to modification"'',{{sfn|Rea|Wright|1997|p=10}} and suggested the modification that "''portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab and should be excluded.''" The Arabs and British disagreed over whether Palestine was meant to be one of those excluded areas, each side producing supporting arguments for their positions based on fine details of the wording and the historical circumstances of the correspondence.

Jonathan Schneer provides an analogy to explain the central dispute over the meaning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Presume a line extending from the ''districts'' of New York, New Haven, New London, and Boston, excluding territory west from an imaginary coastal kingdom. If by ''districts'' one means "vicinity" or "environs," that is one thing with regard to the land excluded, but if one means "''vilayets''" or "provinces," or in the American instance "states," it is another altogether. There are no states of Boston, New London, or New Haven, just as there were no provinces of Hama and Homs, but there is a state of New York, just as there was a ''vilayet'' of Damascus, and territory to the west of New York State is different from territory to the west of the district of New York, presumably New York City and environs, just as territory to the west of the ''vilayet'' of Damascus is different from territory to the west of the district of Damascus, presumably the city of Damascus and its environs.{{sfn|Schneer|2010|p=66-67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="Without detriment to France" debate===
In the letter of 24 October, the English version is as follows:

"..., we accept those limits and boundaries; and in regard to those portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her ally France"

At a meeting in Whitehall in December 1920 the English and Arabic texts of McMahon’s correspondence with Sharif Husein were compared. As one official, who was present, put it,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Arabic version sent to King Husain this is so translated as to make it appear that Gt Britain is free to act without detriment to France in the whole of the limits mentioned. This passage of course had been our sheet anchor: it enabled us to tell the French that we had reserved their rights, and the Arabs that there were regions in which they wd have eventually to come to terms with the French. It is extremely awkward to have this piece of solid ground cut from under our feet. I think that HMG will probably jump at the opportunity of making a sort of amende by sending Feisal to Mesopotamia. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Barr argues that although McMahon had intended to reserve the French interests, he became a victim of his own cleverness since the translator Ruhi lost the qualifying sense of the sentence in the Arabic version.{{sfn|Barr|2011|loc=Ch.2,9}}{{efn|group=lower-alpha|In his 'Setting the Desert on Fire' published 2 years earlier, Barr had explained things differently in describing how after being missing for nearly fifteen years, copies of the Arabic versions of the two most significant letters were found in a clear-out of Ronald Storrs’s office in Cairo. "This careless translation completely changes the meaning of the reservation, or at any rate makes the meaning exceedingly ambiguous,"the Lord Chancellor admitted, in a secret legal opinion on the strength of the Arab claim circulated to the cabinet on 23 January 1939.}}

In a Cabinet analysis of diplomatic developments prepared in May 1917, [[The Honourable|The Hon.]] [[William Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech|William Ormsby-Gore]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]], argued that: {{quote|French intentions in Syria are surely incompatible with the war aims of the Allies as defined to the Russian Government. If the self-determination of nationalities is to be the principle, the interference of France in the selection of advisers by the Arab Government and the suggestion by France of the Emirs to be selected by the Arabs in Mosul, Aleppo, and Damascus would seem utterly incompatible with our ideas of liberating the Arab nation and of establishing a free and independent Arab State. The British Government, in authorising the letters despatched to King Hussein before the outbreak of the revolt by Sir Henry McMahon, would seem to raise a doubt as to whether our pledges to King Hussein as head of the Arab nation are consistent with French intentions to make not only Syria but Upper Mesopotamia another Tunis. If our support of King Hussein and the other Arabian leaders of less distinguished origin and prestige means anything it means that we are prepared to recognise the full sovereign independence of the Arabs of Arabia and Syria. It would seem time to acquaint the French Government with our detailed pledges to King Hussein, and to make it clear to the latter whether he or someone else is to be the ruler of Damascus, which is the one possible capital for an Arab State, which could command the obedience of the other Arabian Emirs.&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Report, No. XVIII, 31 May 1917, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|UK National Archives]] CAB/24/143&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Declassified British Cabinet Papers include a telegram dated 18 October 1915 from Sir Henry McMahon to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Lord Grey]], requesting instructions.{{sfn|Kedouri|2014|pp=88–92}}&lt;ref name="Grey"&gt;[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|UK National Archives]], [http://filestore.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pdfs/large/cab-24-214.pdf CAB/24/214, CP 271 (30)].&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon described conversations with a man named [[Muhammed Sharif al-Faruqi]], a member of the Abd party, who advised how the British could satisfy the demands of the Syrian Nationalists for the independence of Arabia. Faroqi had said that the Arabs would fight if the French attempted to occupy the cities of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo, but he thought they would accept some modification of the North-Western boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca. Based on these conversatuobs, McMahon suggested the language: "In so far as Britain was free to act without detriment to the interests of her ''present Allies'', Great Britain accepts the principle of the independence of Arabia within limits propounded by the Sherif of Mecca." Lord Grey authorized McMahon to pledge the areas requested by the Sherif subject to the reserve for the Allies.{{sfn|Kedouri|2014|pp=88–92}}

===Arab position===

The Arab position was that they could not refer to Palestine since that lay well to the south of the named places. In particular, the Arabs argued that the ''vilayet'' (province) of Damascus did not exist and that the district (''sanjak'') of Damascus covered only the area surrounding the city itself and furthermore that Palestine was part of the ''vilayet'' of 'Syria A-Sham', which was not mentioned in the exchange of letters.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=48}}

Supporters of this interpretation also note that during the war, thousands of proclamations were dropped in all parts of Palestine, carrying a message from the Sharif Hussein on one side and a message from the British Command on the other, to the effect 'that an Anglo-Arab agreement had been arrived at securing the independence of the Arabs.'{{efn|The 1939 committee wrote that: "The contention that the British Government did intend Palestine to be removed from the sphere of French influence and to be included within the area of Arab independence (that is to say, within the area of future British influence) is also borne out by the measures they took in Palestine during the War. They dropped proclamations by the thousand in all parts of Palestine, which bore a message from the Sharif Husain on one side and a message from the British Command on the other, to the effect that an Anglo-Arab agreement had been arrived at securing the independence of the Arabs, and to ask the Arab population of Palestine to look upon the advancing British Army as allies and liberators and give them every assistance. Under the aegis of the British military authorities, recruiting offices were opened in Palestine to recruit volunteers for the forces of the Arab Revolt. Throughout 1916 and the greater part of 1917, the attitude of the military and political officers of the British Army was clearly based on the understanding that Palestine was destined to form part of the Arab territory which was to be constituted after the War on the basis of independent Arab governments in close alliance with Great Britain."{{sfn|Arab-British Committee|1939|p=Annex A, paragraph 19}}}}

In the public arena, Balfour had come under criticism in the House of Commons, when the Liberals and Labor Socialists moved a resolution 'That secret treaties with the allied governments should be revised, since, in their present form, they are inconsistent with the object for which this country entered the war and are, therefore, a barrier to a democratic peace.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/06/21/102712105.pdf|date=21 June 1918|author=New York Times|title=No Peace Basis Yet, Balfour Asserts|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to growing criticism arising from the seemingly contradictory commitments undertaken by the United Kingdom in the McMahon-Hussein correspondence, the Sykes–Picot Agreement and the Balfour declaration, the 1922 [[Churchill White Paper]], took the position that Palestine had ''always'' been excluded from the Arab area. Although this directly contradicted numerous previous government documents, those documents were not known to the public at the time. As part of preparing this White Paper, Sir John Shuckburgh of the British Colonial Office had exchanged correspondence with McMahon, and reliance was placed on a 1920 memorandum by Major Hubert Young, who had noted that in the original Arabic text, the word translated as "districts" in English was "vilayets", a vilayet being the largest class of administrative district into which the Ottoman Empire was divided. He concluded that "district of Damascus", i.e., "vilayet of Damascus", must have referred to the vilayet of which Damascus was the capital, the [[Vilayet of Syria]]. This vilayet extended southward to the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], but excluded most of Palestine.{{sfn|Kedouri|2014|p=245}}{{sfn|Friedman|2000|p=83}}{{sfn|Huneidi|2001|p=65}}

While some British Governments have occasionally stated that the ''intent'' of the McMahon Correspondence was not to promise Palestine to Hussein, they have also occasionally acknowledged the flaws in the legal terminology of the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence that make this position problematic. For example, the weak points of the government's interpretation were acknowledged in a detailed memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1939.

No vilayets of these names exist…and it would be difficult to argue that the word "districts" can have two completely different meanings in the space of a few lines.
(ii) the fact that Homs and Hama were not the capitals of vilayets, but were both within the Vilayet of Syria.
(iii) the fact that the real title of the "Vilayet of Damascus" was "Vilayet of Syria."
(iv) the fact that there is no land lying west of the Vilayet of Aleppo.
The Foreign Secretary summarized "It may be possible to produce arguments designed to explain away some of these difficulties individually (although even this does not apply in the case of (iv)), but it is hardly possible to explain them away collectively. His Majesty’s Government need not on this account abjure altogether the counter-argument based on the meaning of the word "district," which have been used publicly for many years, and the more obvious defects in which do not seem to have been noticed as yet by Arab critics." }}

A committee established by the British in 1939 to clarify the various arguments observed that many commitments had been made during and after the war – and that all of them would have to be studied together. The Arab representatives submitted a statement to the committee from Sir [[Michael McDonnell]]{{sfn|Arab-British Committee|1939|p=Annex C}} which explained that whatever McMahon had intended to mean was of no legal consequence, since it was his actual statements that constituted the pledge from His Majesty's Government.{{sfn|Arab-British Committee|1939|p=Annex C}} The Arab representatives also pointed out that McMahon had been acting as an intermediary for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Grey.{{sfn|Arab-British Committee|1939|p=Annex C}} Speaking in the House of Lords on 27 March 1923, Lord Grey had made it clear that, for his part, he entertained serious doubts as to the validity of the Churchill White Paper's interpretation of the pledges which he, as Foreign Secretary, had caused to be given to the Sharif Husain in 1915. {{efn|group=lower-alpha| Viscount Grey of Fallodon (McMahon’s superior when the correspondence was entered into) "A considerable number of these engagements, or some of them, which have not been officially made public by the Government, have become public through other sources. Whether all have become public I do not know, but. I seriously suggest to the Government that the best way of clearing our honour in this matter is officially to publish the whole of the engagements relating to the matter, which we entered into during the war. If they are found to be not inconsistent with one another our honour is cleared. If they turn out to be inconsistent, I 655 think it will be very much better that the amount, character and extent of the inconsistencies should be known, and that we should state frankly that, in the urgency of the war, engagements were entered into which were not entirely consistent with each other. I am sure that we cannot redeem our honour by covering up our engagements and pretending that there is no inconsistency, if there really is inconsistency. I am sure that the most honourable course will be to let it be known what the engagements are, and, if there is inconsistency, then to admit it frankly, and, admitting that fact, and having enabled people to judge exactly what is the amount of the inconsistency, to consider what is the most fair and honourable way out of the impasse into which the engagements may have led us. Without comparing one engagement with another, I think that we are placed in considerable difficulty by the Balfour Declaration itself. I have not the actual words here, but I think the noble Duke opposite will not find fault with my summary of it. It promised a Zionist home without prejudice to the civil and religious rights of the population of Palestine. A Zionist home, my Lords, undoubtedly means or implies a Zionist Government over the district in which the home is placed, and if 93 per cent. of the population of Palestine are Arabs, I do not see how you can establish other than an Arab Government, without prejudice to their civil rights. That one sentence alone of the Balfour Declaration seems to me to involve, without over-stating the case, very great difficulty of fulfilment."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard]], [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1923/mar/27/palestine-constitution Palestine Constitution]: HL Deb 27 March 1923 vol 53 cc639-69&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The various pledges are given in the Foreign Office paper [E.C. 2201] which has been circulated, and I need only refer to them in the briefest possible words. In their bearing on Syria they are the following: First there was the letter to King Hussein from Sir Henry McMahon of the 24th October 1915, in which we gave him the assurance that the Hedjaz, the red area which we commonly call Mesopotamia, the brown area or Palestine, the Acre-Haifa enclave, the big Arab areas (A) and (B), and the whole of the Arabian peninsula down to Aden should be Arab and independent."&lt;br&gt;"The Palestine position is this. If we deal with our commitments, there is first the general pledge to Hussein in October 1915, under which Palestine was included in the areas as to which Great Britain pledged itself that they should be Arab and independent in the future... the United Kingdom and France – Italy subsequently agreeing – committed themselves to an international administration of Palestine in consultation with Russia, who was an ally at that time... A new feature was brought into the case in November 1917, when Mr Balfour, with the authority of the War Cabinet, issued his famous declaration to the Zionists that Palestine 'should be the national home of the Jewish people, but that nothing should be done – and this, of course, was a most important proviso – to prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. Those, as far as I know, are the only actual engagements into which we entered with regard to Palestine."&lt;/small&gt;{{sfn|Reid|2011|p=71–75}}{{sfn|Ingrams|2009|p=48, from UK Archives PRO.

| &lt;small&gt;"The Arab Revolt had begun on false pretences. To gain the Sherif's help our Cabinet had offered, through Sir Henry McMahon, to support the establishment of native governments in parts of Syria and Mesopotamia, 'saving the interests of our ally, France'. The last modest clause concealed a treaty (kept secret, till too late, from McMahon, and therefore from the Sherif) by which France, England and Russia agreed to annex some of these promised areas, and to establish their respective spheres of influence over all the rest... Rumours of the fraud reached Arab ears, from Turkey. In the East persons were more trusted than institutions. So the Arabs, having tested my friendliness and sincerity under fire, asked me, as a free agent, to endorse the promises of the British Government. I had had no previous or inner knowledge of the McMahon pledges and the Sykes-Picot treaty, which were both framed by war-time branches of the Foreign Office. But, not being a perfect fool, I could see that if we won the war the promises to the Arabs were dead paper. Had I been an honourable adviser I would have sent my men home, and not let them risk their lives for such stuff. Yet the Arab inspiration was our main tool in winning the Eastern war. So I assured them that England kept her word in letter and spirit. In this comfort they performed their fine things: but, of course, instead of being proud of what we did together, I was continually and bitterly ashamed."{{sfn|Mangold|2016|p=378}}&lt;/small&gt;

| &lt;small&gt;[[Churchill White Paper]] following the 1921 [[Jaffa riots]]
&lt;br&gt; [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] response
&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;"In the first place, it is not the case, as has been represented by the Arab Delegation, that during the war His Majesty's Government gave an undertaking that an independent national government should be at once established in Palestine. This representation mainly rests upon a letter dated 24 October 1915, from Sir Henry McMahon, then His Majesty's High Commissioner in Egypt, to the Sharif of Mecca, now King Hussein of the Kingdom of the Hejaz. That letter is quoted as conveying the promise to the Sherif of Mecca to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories proposed by him. But this promise was given subject to a reservation made in the same letter, which excluded from its scope, among other territories, the portions of Syria lying to the west of the District of Damascus. This reservation has always been regarded by His Majesty's Government as covering the vilayet of Beirut and the independent Sanjak of Jerusalem. The whole of Palestine west of the Jordan was thus excluded from Sir. Henry McMahon's pledge."
&lt;br&gt;
"His Majesty's Government have always regarded and continue to regard Palestine as excluded by these provisos from the scope of their undertaking. This is clear from the fact, to which the hon. Member refers, that in the following year they concluded an agreement with the French and Russian Governments under which Palestine was to receive special treatment... it would not be in the public interest to publish one or all of the documents comprising the long and inconclusive correspondence that took place with the Sheriff of Mecca in 1915–16."&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard]], [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1922/jul/11/pledges-to-arabs Pledges to Arabs]: HC Deb 11 July 1922 vol 156 cc1032-5&lt;/ref&gt;

| &lt;small&gt;"The question is: Did the excluded area cover Palestine or not? The late Government maintained that it did and that the intention to exclude Palestine was clearly under stood, both by His Majesty's Government and by the Sherif, at the time that the correspondence took place. Their view is supported by the fact that in the following year (1916) we concluded an agreement with the French and Russian Governments under which Palestine was to receive special treatment-on an international basis. The weak point in the argument is that, on the strict wording of Sir H. McMahon's letter, the natural meaning of the phrase "west of the district of Damascus" has to be somewhat strained in order to cover an area lying considerably to the south, as well as to the west, of the City of Damascus."&lt;/small&gt;{{sfn|Quigley|2010|p=11–12}}&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|UK National Archives]], [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D7725398 CAB 24/159/6] 17 February 1923&lt;/ref&gt;

* (i) the fact that the word "district" is applied not only to Damascus, &amp;c., where the reading of vilayet is at least arguable, but also immediately previously to [[Mersina]] and [[Alexandretta]]. No vilayets of these names exist...and it would be difficult to argue that the word "districts" can have two completely different meanings in the space of a few lines.
* (ii) the fact that Horns and Hama were not the capitals of vilayets, but were both within the Vilayet of Syria.
* (iii) the fact that the real title of the "Vilayet of Damascus" was "Vilayet of Syria."
* (iv) the fact that there is no land lying west of the Vilayet of Aleppo.

...It may be possible to produce arguments designed to explain away some of these difficulties individually (although even this does not apply in the case of (iv)), but it is hardly possible to explain them away collectively. His Majesty's Government need not on this account abjure altogether the counter-argument based on the meaning of the word "district," which have been used publicly for many years, and the more obvious defects in which do not seem to have been noticed as yet by Arab critics."&lt;/small&gt;{{sfn|Rush|1995|p=21}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

}}'''YP Western Directory LLC''', formerly '''Pacific Bell Directory''', was the advertising and publishing division of the [[Pacific Telesis]] Group. PBD Holdings held '''Pacific Bell Directory''' under its umbrella, who published directories in both Nevada and California.

Pacific Bell Directory was founded in 1984 to take over directory operations formerly provided by [[Pacific Bell]] and [[Nevada Bell]] themselves. PBD published its [[telephone directory|telephone directories]] under the '''SMART Yellow Pages''' name. Upon brand integration of its Bell Operating Companies by [[SBC Communications]], it retained the SMART Yellow Pages name for a time following this period. After 2004, however, it ceased using the SMART name.

Pacific Bell Directory's listings compilation division was merged with '''Southwestern Bell Advertising, L.P.''', forming '''SBC Advertising, L.P.''' It was renamed in 2006 to the current '''AT&amp;T Advertising, L.P.''' Pacific Bell Directory still exists today to serve as the directory publisher of the [[AT&amp;T Yellow Pages|AT&amp;T Real Yellow Pages]] for Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell customers.

In 2012, Pacific Bell Directory was spun off as part of the AT&amp;T-Cerberus joint venture [[YP Holdings]]. It was reincorporated in Delaware as '''YP Western Directory LLC'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3103">'''The Providence Chapel''' originally came from Darby End/Hand near [[Netherton, West Midlands|Netherton]]. It was one of the first buildings to be rebuilt on the [[Black Country Living Museum]] site. It is an excellent example of a typical [[Black Country]] [[Methodist]] chapel.

==Chapel Origins==
The Darby family brought a plot of land on Northfield Road and in 1828 work began on building the chapel. The ‘Providence Chapel’ was named after a chapel in Epwarth, Lincolnshire and was affiliated to the Methodist New Connection. The chapel played a central part in the life of the local community for one hundred and fifty years. It was a well-known centre of [[Christian]] beliefs and practices with a strong tradition of choral singing. The chapel was also a centre of education and welfare; it helped to alleviate hardship amongst the low paid workers of the Black Country. Trustees of the chapel created clubs like the Darby Hand Doctors Club to provide medical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Providence Chapel|url=http://www.bclm.co.uk/locations/providence-chapel/24.htm|work=Providence Chapel|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|accessdate=5/4/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relocation ==

In May 1971 the [[Sunday school]] building was destroyed by a fire, the chapel was closed in August 1974. The land was set to be sold and the building demolished. The [[Black Country Living Museum]] was invited to save some of the pews. The Museum was in fact interested in saving the whole building and in November 1975 the building was dismantled and the larger parts transferred to the Museum site. There were however problems with certain bricks which could not be used again. As luck would have it, it was possible to dismantle another chapel in Wolverhampton Street, Dudley which dated from 1828-9. This provided the right kind of brick for the chapel. Reconstruction at the Museum began in June 1977 and took two years, the chapel was dedicated in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Black Country Living Museum Guide|year=2012|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Building ==
The chapel is a simple, brick-built, rectangle with two small rear extensions. The front is ‘relieved’ by an impressive entrance of rendered brick. The interior is plain and functional with a small lobby underneath a gallery that runs down the sides and rear of the chapel. The side galleries are supported by fluted columns with ornate capitals that divide the interior into aisles.  In the middle stands a dominant pulpit where the [[Minister (Christianity)|Minister]] would be able to see the whole of his congregation. The pulpit is situated below a scrolled banner painted on the wall which proclaims “Worship the Lord in the Beauty of Holiness” .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black Country Living Museum|title=Black Country Living Museum Guide|year=2012|publisher=Black Country Living Museum|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rabbit Rampage''''' is a 1955 [[Bugs Bunny]] [[animated cartoon]], directed by [[Chuck Jones]] and produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]], which originally debuted on June 11, 1955. It is a [[spiritual successor]] (as well as a [[sequel]]) to ''[[Duck Amuck]]'', in which [[Daffy Duck]] was teased by an off-screen animator, revealed at the end to be Bugs Bunny. In ''Rabbit Rampage'', Bugs is similarly teased by another off-screen animator who is revealed at the end to be [[Elmer Fudd]].

The cartoon inspired a 1993 video game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], ''[[Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage]]'', which allows the player to control Bugs, following a similar plot. A few clips from this short were shown in a trailer for the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1]]'' DVD set (seen on the ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' DVD), but was not included as part of that set. The complete short was released on the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6|Volume 6]]'' set of the series as a "bonus" cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/old-brew/looney-tunes-vol-6-bonus-materials cartoonbrew.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908113335/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/old-brew/looney-tunes-vol-6-bonus-materials |date=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The short opens to Bugs Bunny's hole being drawn in the ground; the animator abruptly erases and redraws the hole in the sky. A sleepy Bugs climbs out and falls to the ground. When Bugs realizes who is in charge of the feature, he makes his desire plain to not be a victim of an animator who plans on making him look bad. With that said, Bugs is about to get back into his rabbit hole, but the animator erases it, causing Bugs to jump headfirst into the ground. After Bugs stands up, he restates his desire to not work with the animator, who paints a yellow streak on Bugs' back, implying that Bugs is a coward. Bugs then grabs the brush and breaks it in half.

Bugs emphatically states that he will report the animator to Warner Bros. and calls the animator "a menace to society", while the animator draws a picket sign ("I won't work") in Bugs's left hand. When Bugs sees the sign, he throws it on the ground, off-screen. Bugs asks if the animator is trying to get him fired, before explaining that he has become a good asset to the studio, which gives the animator time to draw another picket sign ("I refuse to live up to my contract"). After throwing away the last sign off-screen, Bugs returns, wiping off the yellow paint with a towel. Afterwards, Bugs agrees to work on the picture, but pauses once he sees that the animator drew a hat on his head, prompting Bugs to throw it on the ground, stating that the animator knows he is not supposed to wear a hat. In response, the animator draws a big pink women's hat, and Bugs throws it on the ground, too. This cycle continues with various ridiculous hats and wigs until Bugs gives up. The animator draws a rotated forest, and Bugs tries to get in his hole by climbing down a nearby tree. The animator draws an anvil on Bugs' tail, causing Bugs to fall on a street, later rolling into an empty area.

Angry, Bugs incoherently yells at the animator, which the animator responds to by erasing Bugs's head. When Bugs notices this, he taps one foot impatiently and points at the spot where his head existed. The animator then draws a [[jack-o'-lantern]] on Bugs' body. When Bugs realizes this, he demands it be corrected, which the animator supplies by simply adding rabbit ears to the existing head, infuriating Bugs even further. The animator erases the pumpkin head and then draws a tiny version of Bugs' head. Bugs does not realize what has happened until he pulls a carrot out of his pocket, stopping short when he sees that something else is wrong and that the carrot is now huge. He then takes notice of his high-pitched voice. He smacks his hand against his face and realizes that his head is now small. He angrily requests that the animator draw his head back in properly, which he does, except he forgets to apply the ears. Bugs requests the ears to which the animator puts in human ears. Bugs requests that he have long rabbit ears, to which the animator then draws long, droopy rabbit ears, only to revert them back when Bugs snaps at him to not, "be so danged literal!"

Now with his ears back, Bugs walks away, only to have his tail erased and then replaced with a horse's tail after Bugs orders that his tail be put back. When Bugs states that a horse's tail belongs on a horse, the animator erases Bugs's body and redraws him as a horse. Bugs, while standing on two hindlegs and eating a carrot, points out to the artist that this misinterpretation will not make his employers happy seeing that his contract clearly says that he is to be drawn as a rabbit, allowing the animator to pretend to comply with what Bugs is telling him by erasing Bugs's horse body and drawing him as a more abstract, simplified rabbit with big cheeks and feet.  The abstract version of Bugs warns the animator that this latest bit of teasing can lead to serious consequences for ''both'' of them, which leads the animator to draw him back to normal.

When Bugs sardonically asks the animator if he wants to paint him into a grasshopper, the animator takes out a brush and Bugs quickly takes it back. Bugs attempts to make friends with the animator, promising that they could do something popular. In response, the animator draws two clones of Bugs, prompting Bugs to shove the clones out of the picture. As Bugs states that he will not leave the spot until the animator gets the boss, the animator paints Bugs on a railroad track with a train coming through a tunnel behind it. As the train passes by, Bugs leans on a rock and says that he knows one way out and that the animator cannot stop Bugs. He jumps up and pulls down a card with the words "The End."

The camera pulls back to the animator, who is revealed to be [[Elmer Fudd]], in a cameo appearance, who laughs and states his delight to the audience by saying, "Weww anyway, I finawwy got even with that scwewy wabbit!"

==Cast==
* [[Mel Blanc]] as [[Bugs Bunny]]
* [[Arthur Q. Bryan]] as [[Elmer Fudd]]

==History==
A similar plot was also included in the episode "Duck's Reflucks" of ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]],'' in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. It is done once again with Daffy tormenting Bugs in the ''[[New Looney Tunes]]'' episode "One Carroter in Search of an Artist", with the technology updated and the pencil and paintbrush replaced by a digital pen.

In issue #94 of the ''Looney Tunes'' comic, Bugs Bunny gets his back at Daffy Duck by making him the victim, in switching various movie roles, from [[Duck Twacy]] in ''Who Killed Daffy Duck''," a video game character, and a talk show host, and they always wind up with Daffy starring in ''[[Moby Dick]]'' (the story's running gag). After this, Bugs comments, "Eh, dis guy needs a new agent."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1060">In '''''S v Van As en 'n Ander''''', an important case in South African criminal law, the police were locking a suspect in a patrol van, when the young children in his company disappeared. The following morning, after a search in vain the night before, two of them were found dead from exposure. The police were charged with and convicted of culpable homicide. On appeal, however, the court held that, although it would have been reasonable to continue the search and to make further enquiries, it had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt that the children would have been found by a proper search. It also had not been so proved that the failure to institute such a search was responsible for the children's deaths.

[[Image:Shaker Shed, Shelburne Museum, Shelburne VT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Shaker Shed&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Shaker Shed''' is an exhibit building at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]]. It exhibits the Museum's collection of hand-tools and household equipment. 

==Background==
Shaker Shed, an unornamented structure, originally served [[Canterbury Shaker Village]], a large Shaker community in [[Canterbury, New Hampshire]]. Dubbed “[[Shakers]]” because of the frenetic dancing involved in their worship service, their religious sect was formally known as United Society of Believers in the First and Second Appearance of Christ (''see'' [[The United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing]]). Guided by self-sufficiency, hard work, and [[celibacy]], the Shakers were widely known in the nineteenth century for the quality of their crafts and garden products. They produced unadorned and finely crafted furnishings, seeds, and herbal medicines for the community, which they eventually sold nationwide by wagon and by mail.

==History==
Built in 1840 as a one-story horse and carriage stand, the five [[granite]] pillars, visible between the carriage bays, strengthen the heavy timber framework. The original proprietors enlarged the basic structure twice over a period of thirteen years: in 1850 an addition of one and a half upper stories provided storage space for brooms made and sold by the Canterbury community then, in 1853 the Shakers added shed to the rear of the building to store their farm machinery.

===Relocation===
The Shelburne Museum moved Shaker Shed to the grounds in 1951 to serve as exhibition space for the collection of hand-tools and household equipment. 

==Collection==
Shelburne Museum’s collection of woodworking tools encompasses a wide variety of hand tools and machinery that craftspeople, such as [[carpenter]]s, [[joiner]]s, [[cabinetmaker]]s, and [[Cooper (profession)|coopers]], used to provide essential goods and services to their local communities. Craftsmen, who worked primarily with readily available, native woods, required specialized tools to create their products. 

To construct buildings, early settlers would fell trees using axes and shape the logs into heavy, squared lumber with adzes. They would then interlock the lumber using [[mortise and tenon]] joints, secured with wooden pins, to create a structure’s frame. Unlike iron nails, the wooden pins would expand and contract with the building’s frame. All of the museum’s historic structures, but most clearly the second floor of Horseshoe Barn (see [[Horseshoe Barn and Annex]]), reflect mortise and tenon joinery. 

The American building trade became highly specialized: sawyers would work in teams to saw boards and planks from felled timber; carpenters would frame houses, lay floors, and build staircases; joiners focused on finer work, such as fitting joints, framing doors and windows, and preparing paneling, moldings and trim; while cabinetmakers, who employed many of the same skills as joiners, created chests-of-drawers, desks, tables, and other furniture. 

[[Plane (tool)|Planes]], used to prepare surfaces, fit joints, and cut particular decorative shapes for moldings and trim, remained the most specialized tool that woodworkers used. Craftsmen developed dozens of different planes for precise use. A typical joiner or cabinetmaker’s tool chest contained twenty to fifty planes.

Coopering, or barrel making, remained an important occupation through the nineteenth century. Using froes to split barrel staves and curved “sun” planes to shape the ends of mounted staves, coopers produced containers of all sizes. Ranging from small water and liquor kegs to 206-gallon hogsheads, their barrels stored goods including tobacco, whale oil, whiskey, molasses, flour, apples, sugar, and hardware. Household appliances such as water tubs, sap buckets, butter churns, milk pails, and drinking or ladling mugs called piggins, reflected the extensive reach of a coopers’ trade. The United States 1850 census recorded forty-three thousand practicing coopers, but by the late nineteenth century, the introduction of metal drums and other machine-made storage and shipping containers greatly diminished the demand for wooden cooperage so that today the craft is almost nonexistent. 

The inaccessibility of processed metals in early American meant that people incorporated wood into all aspects of construction including plumbing. Early American underground water pipes were made of cedar or pine logs that had been cut while still green, hollowed out with special augers and fitted together. They linked supply sources such as springs or reservoirs with homes and businesses. These pump logs were virtually indestructible so that some were still used in [[Philadelphia]] as late as the 1950s.

'''Shopping.com''' is a [[price comparison service]] owned by [[eBay]] and operates websites in USA, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Australia. Shopping.com started out with the name DealTime.com which still operates as a related, but otherwise separate website.

==History==
Shopping.com began as Papricom (DealTime.com),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-367545|title=PapriCom Technologies Wins CommerceNet Award - Globes English|website=Globes|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded in [[Israel]] in 1998 by Dr. Nahum Sharfman and Amir Ashkenazi,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108482/000119312504177779/d424b1.htm|title=Prospectus Filed Pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1)|website=www.sec.gov|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the original business model was to create a downloadable client that would monitor changes in prices of products the user seeks to buy over time, notifying the user when the product price reached a predetermined level (hence the site's original name, DealTime). Originally targeting [[United States|American]] consumers, the basic concept was quickly modified from a downloadable client to a purely web-based service, a concept the company has kept ever since.

After recruiting a management team of high-ranking executives from other industries, DealTime underwent rapid expansion in 2000 including formation of a major alliance with media giant [[Bertelsmann]], adding [[UK|British]], [[Germany|German]], [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Japan]]ese versions of its original American-targeted website, and acquiring [[Digital Jones]], a product advisory website. However, during 2000 and 2001 it became apparent that the operation was losing a significant amount of money and that massive changes were needed. Three rounds of layoffs done in 2001 and 2002 halved the workforce to some 150; the Japanese and German websites were scrapped in late 2001, as well as plans for an early IPO, and Digital Jones was shelved. Also, a growing percentage of the merchants being advertised on DealTime's website were forced to start paying for this service or become de-listed; some lucrative product categories became paying-merchants-only. In 2002, a new bidding system was introduced, in which the highest-bidding merchant got higher placement on the default price comparison results page (consumers could always sort by price or rating). All these changes enabled the company to become profitable for the first time in 2003.

Under the leadership of its CEO, [[Daniel T. Ciporin]], in April 2003, DealTime acquired the [[California]]-based consumer product review site [[Epinions.com]].  In September 2003, the merged sites relaunched under the Shopping.com brand and web address which it had purchased from [[Alta Vista]]. The new name, as well as some offline (TV) advertisement and large online advertisement with partners such as [[Google]] and other portals, enabled Shopping.com to become the 3rd most-visited consumer website, following [[eBay]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], for several months during 2004, and continuously in the top-10. Although Shopping.com remained an Israeli corporation with R&amp;D facilities in [[Netanya]], Israel, it had a strong US presence with its corporate headquarters first in New York City (1998–2003) and later in Brisbane, California.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The company went finally public in October 2004, and was acquired by eBay in June 2005 for $21 per share in cash, or total consideration of approximately $634 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.ebay.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=171732 |title=eBay Inc. - eBay Completes Acquisition of Shopping.com |publisher=Investor.ebay.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently a semi-autonomous division within eBay and still runs the www.shopping.com website. eBay and Shopping.com functionalities are slowly being merged, for example eBay's [[PayPal]] payment system in SDC's offering to its advertising merchants.  Shopping.com accepts CPC bidding.  Merchants must pay a minimum of $100.

Since 2005, the company has added [[France|French]], [[Australia]]n and once again a German version of its website.

In April 2009, 61-year-old Nahum Sharfman was killed, along with his wife Nava, when their private plane crashed in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famousdeaddb.com Famous Dead DB]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6010">[[Image:Chishouse.jpg|thumb|The Christopher House]]
'''The Christopher House''' is an outstanding example of a provincial pre-Revolutionary War vernacular farmhouse of stone masonry. It is associated with two of the oldest Staten Island families. It was also used as a meeting place during the [[American Revolution]], while being the residence of Joseph Christopher, a member of the [[Richmond County, New York|Richmond County]] [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] from 1775-1776.  It was moved to [[Historic Richmond Town]] the Autumn of 1969 and restored for museum presentation from 1975-1977.

==Construction==
According to reporting by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1967, the original section was built in 1756, and a section twice that size believed to be added about 1764. Current Historic Richmond Town institutional belief, based on extensive research by Loring McMillen places those dates earlier to circa 1720 for the original portion, with the addition from circa 1730.

The structure is built in the Colonial salt-box tradition and was originally situated in the section of Staten Island now called [[Willowbrook, Staten Island|Willowbrook]]. While there, it then stood on the brink of the treacherous marshes that covered a great portion of the Island, known as the great swamp.
The building consists of two sections with 22-inch thick native fieldstone walls with wood above. It is one and one-half stories tall with a low cellar and gable roof

==Original Location==
The structure was originally located, roughly, at the street address of 819 Willowbrook Road, [[Staten Island]]. The proximity of the homestead on its original property to the Groad Swamp of those days offered opportunities for escape, in case of surprise, for those who attended the clandestine meetings held in this house during the Revolutionary War.

==Museum Interpretation==
Current interpretive use of this building at [[Historic Richmond Town]] demonstrates daily farm life from the mid-to late-18th century. The house is furnished primarily for cooking demonstrations at this time, making use of a restored jamb less fireplace.

==Inhabitants and Their Occupations==
John Christopher (believed to have built the house but may not have been a resident), Farmer?&lt;br /&gt;
Col. Thomas Dongan, (grand-nephew of Governor [[Thomas Dongan]], (1745-1757)&lt;br /&gt; 
Nelly Haughwout (by 1761)&lt;br /&gt;
Joseph Christopher Sr. (by 24 May 1764)&lt;br /&gt;
Joseph Christopher Jr. (23 April 1825), Farmer/Cooper-Woodworker&lt;br /&gt;
David Decker (4 September 1827)&lt;br /&gt;
Thomas Standring (19 October 1852 – 15 February 1858), Hardware &amp; Comb Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;
Samuel Stansring (before 1962), Hardware &amp; Comb Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;
Mrs. Eugene C. Egan (before 1962)&lt;br /&gt;
Staten Island Historical Society (17 May 1969)

==Call for Preservation==
On September 13, 1966, the Landmarks Preservation Commission held a public hearing on the proposed designation as a Landmark of the Christopher House and the proposed designation of the related Landmark Site. The hearing had been duly advertised in accordance with the provisions of the law. Two witnesses spoke in favor of designation, there were no speakers in opposition. The owner of the property indicated to the Commission that he is in favor of the proposed designation. 
The building was granted NYC Landmark status on 13th, December 1967.

In early 1969 the History Committee sent a letter to Senator [[John Marchi]] asking for support to preserve the Christopher House. There was also a petition presented showing community support for the preservation of the house.

The community signed the petition, stating:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:Whereas Vernon B. Hampton of Staten Island, New York, on a number of occasions through the years has urged the preservation of the Christopher House - a shrine of Patriotism during the American Revolution - Headquarters of the Staten Island Committee of Sarety, and a successful meeting place and shelter for General Washington's secret agents within enemy lines during the long war years of the struggle for American Independence, and
:Whereas It is especially appropriate that Acquisition and Restoration of the Christopher House located near Willowbrook Road be implemented at this time in order to assure that the historic shrine shall be the focal point of Staten Island's observance in 1976 of the Bicentennial of American Independence, and
:Whereas The significance of the shrine to Richmond County and the State of New York suggests that New York State acquire the Christopher House and a small parksite around it to bring the goal of preservation into actuality. Therefore
:I am pleased to join with others in signing this petition and thus promote popular support for the Christopher House Preservation Movement and perhaps the formation of a Christopher House Association.

==In Pop Culture==
It appears that the Christopher House was featured in the CollegeHumor's video entitled "Grammar Nazis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegehumor.com/video/6060107/grammar-nazis CollegeHumor: Grammar Nazis]&lt;/ref&gt; This location was used to reenact a susceptible town under the sphere of Hitler's Reich.
