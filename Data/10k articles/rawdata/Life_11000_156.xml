'''A1one''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|'|l|oʊ|n}}) ({{lang-fa|تنها}}) is the pseudonym of '''Karan Reshad,''' an Iranian [[Visual arts|visual artist]] who pioneered [[graffiti]] and [[street art]] in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="fatcap"&gt;{{cite web|title=An introduction to graffiti and street art from Tehran through A1one a graffiti pioneer in his country|url=http://www.fatcap.com/article/iranian-graffiti.html|accessdate=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His career as a street artist began in his hometown, [[Tehran]].

== Life and career ==
A1one grew up in Iran during a period of war and the Khatami reform era (1997-2005). A1one studied for 5 years at the Art and architecture university in Tehran. While still a student, he began using graffiti around the university campus, as a protest against student conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S, ''Precarious Lives: Waiting and Hope in Iran,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;  He was eventually expelled by the School's President following a disagreement over artistic restrictions. &lt;ref name="artcat"&gt;[http://zine.artcat.com/2008/07/interview.php Rebel Without a Crew: Street Artist A1one in Tehran], ''Artcat.com'', 21 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After being expelled from University, his graffiti activities in the city of [[Tehran]] increased. A1one was the first person to start painting on the city walls. His name can be interpreted as "Alone" or "First One." &lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S., ''Precarious Lives: Waiting and Hope in Iran,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; A1one started painting walls in the late 1990s. He is the pioneer of the urban art scene in [[Middle East]]. When he began, it was a time when nobody knew what graffiti was in his country. He had a very influential role in the rise of street art and stenciling within Iran.&lt;ref name=theage&gt;{{cite news|title=Graffiti cops a spray|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/07/31/1217097393985.html|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=8 April 2015|last=Scott-Norman|first=Fiona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialactive.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/graffitti-in-teheran-instigating-political-change/ Graffitti&lt;!--sic--&gt; in Tehran: Instigating Political Change], ''Socialactive.wordpress.com'', 16 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Already involved in urban arts in general, he met in 2005 the rapper Nima who told him everything about the graffiti culture which triggered A1one's desire to grow in that direction. His first significant work was a painting under the Tehran-Karaj expressway called ''Searching for Friends''.&lt;ref name="A1one first"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080712042707/http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ A1one: 1st generation Graffiti in Iran], ''Pingmap.jp'', 19 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his street art project in 2003 and inspired his close friends at that time to also begin painting on the streets. Artists such as Elle, isba, K.T. and Magoi were the first people to join him in Tehran. With his public space art, he describes his view on the Iranian society and puts himself regularly in danger.&lt;ref name="A1one first"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When I decided to do my painting on walls I bought some spray cans - at that time we had just some very low quality colors in Iran. My first work was a very simple work titled “searching for friends” painted on a wall right next to the Tehran-Karaj expressway late at night. It was a really frightening night for me… The next morning I got three calls from friends who recognized my style of painting. They were shocked to see my work on a public wall. My first stencil was a [[Edvard Munch|Munch's]] [[The Scream|Scream]] Print on Art University walls and after that , experimented with many techniques and methods, but I continue with stencils, graffiti and [[sticker art]]."&lt;ref name=pingmag&gt;{{cite web|title=A1one: 1st generation Graffiti in Iran |url=http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=8 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712042707/http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |archivedate=12 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, he was invited to illustrate the cover of a book, ''Young and Defiant in Iran''; a contempary ethnographic work by Shahram Khosravi. &lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S, ''Precarious Lives: Waiting and Hope in Iran,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he was invited to show his work at the annual Melbourne Stencil Festival, taking 40 pieces of work with him to his first trip in a non-dictatorship country, thus experimenting exhibiting his artwork without the fear of reprisals for the first time.&lt;ref name=theage/&gt;

By 2010, A1One was an established name within Tehran's youth culture and a key figure in the emergence of Iranian street art. &lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S., "Graffiti in Tehran," ''Anthropology Now,'' Vol. 5, No. 1, 2013, pp 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Tehranurbanartalone.jpg|thumb|A1one Spray painted wall in Tehran 2006 ]]
A1one's art world is dynamic and made of many different styles, from portraits to calligraphy and funky characters which he mostly uses for his stickers. A1one's art combines [[Persian calligraphy]] and Western [[graffiti]]. His art has been documented by many photographers and featured in [[Art Asia Pacific]] Magazine.

The artist has been working on a distinctly Iranian style of calligraffiti, which is "a fusion of hip-hop graffiti and Persian typography."&lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S, m ''Precarious Lives: Waiting and Hope in Iran,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; His style is recognised across the [[Islamic graffiti]] world. He has made a handful of the greatest Style walls with Arabic letter graffiti since 2004.&lt;ref name=fatcap2&gt;{{cite news|title=Le graffiti compte déjà de nombreuses formes. Il n'en est que plus intéressant quand il est développé dans des alphabets différents. Voici l'illustration avec l'alphabet Arabe|url=http://www.fatcap.org/article/lettres-arabes.html|date=12 October 2009|accessdate=8 April 2015|first=Morgan|last=Vincent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests==
He has been arrested several times and signed agreements with police not to work in streets.He attacked Iranian Artist Forum with His paintings, while The management of the Iranian artists forum did not understand his aim and stopped him and called the police.
In 2012 A1one was kidnapped by the [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran)]], under the charge of social and political reasons and was held in [[Evin Prison]] for 10 days at Ward 209.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Saint Abraham the Great of Kidunja''' (or '''Kidunaja''') (died c. 366) was a [[hermit]] and [[priest]] of the [[Christian Church]].

==Biography==
The ''Vita'' of St. Abraham was written by his friend, St. Ephrem.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/210/3/151.html Butler, Alban. "St. Abraham, Hermit", ''The Lives of the Saints'', Vol.III, 1866]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham was born to a wealthy family near Edessa, during the third century.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Elizabeth. "St. Abraham Kidunaia: the runaway groom", ''Faith'' magazine, Diocese of Lansing, Michigan, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving an excellent education, Abraham was encouraged to get married. He followed the wishes of his parents, but shortly before the wedding ceremony, he told his bride his desire to dedicate his life to God.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095344611 "Abraham Kidunaia", ''Oxford Dictionary of Saints]&lt;/ref&gt; His bride accepted this resolution and Abraham retired to a cell near the city, where he walled up the cell door, leaving only a small window open for food to be brought him.

Ten years after he retreated from the world, his parents died, leaving Abraham a wealthy man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiccourier.com/faith-family/kids-chronicle/saint-for-today/st-abraham-kidunaia/ "St. Abraham Kidunaia", ''Catholic Courier'', Diocese of Rochester, March 9, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207130908/http://www.catholiccourier.com/faith-family/kids-chronicle/saint-for-today/st-abraham-kidunaia/ |date=December 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had the inheritance distributed to the poor. Abraham became known throughout the region as a holy man and many came to him for guidance.&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt; Reports of his reputation came to the bishop of Edessa who ordained him a priest and sent Abraham to Beth-Kidunaa. When Abraham destroyed the pagan idols and altars, the outraged townspeople drove him away. Abraham would return and urge them to give up their superstitions, and be driven out again. Eventually his persistence began to yield results.&lt;ref name=Staley&gt;[http://www.thecompassnews.org/compass/2003-03-14/03cn0314f2.shtml Staley, Tony. "Left the altar for the desert", ''The Compass'', Diocese of Green Bay, Wisconsin, March 14, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham worked among them for the three years, when fearing that he would begin to desire material possessions he returned to his cell near Edessa where he spent the next fifty years in prayer and penance.&lt;ref name=Staley/&gt; He was known never to reprove anyone sharply but always with charity and gentleness.

Around the year 360 Abraham died at the age of seventy after a long life of service to God.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;

==Legend==
A popular story recounts that his orphan in care of
 Mary had been entrusted to his care. He built a cell near his own and trained her in learning and piety until she was twenty. At this point, seduced by a false monk, she ran away ashamed and went to Troas, where she wound up a prostitute. For two years he lamented her departure not knowing what happened. When he finally learned where she was, he boldly went and recovered her.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;

==Veneration==
The [[feast day]] of Saint Abraham is October 29 in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 88-209-7210-7). The date was formerly March 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Syriac Catholic Church]] commemorates him on December 14, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] on July 29, the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] on October 24.

During the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] that began in March 2003, personnel of the [[United States Army]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] committed a series of [[human rights violations]] against detainees in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html |title=Other government agencies |publisher=Salon.com |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212035108/http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html |archivedate=February 12, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These violations included [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]], [[torture]], [[rape]], [[sodomy]], and [[murder]].&lt;ref name='New Yorker 2004-05-17'&gt;{{cite news | first = Seymour M. | last = Hersh | title = Chain of Command | date = May 17, 2004 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/17/040517fa_fact2?currentPage=all | work = The New Yorker | accessdate = September 13, 2011 | quote = NBC News later quoted U.S. military officials as saying that the unreleased photographs showed American soldiers "severely beating an Iraqi prisoner nearly to death, having sex with a female Iraqi prisoner, and 'acting inappropriately with a dead body.'

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration of George W.

These organizations stated that the abuses at Abu Ghraib were not isolated incidents, but were part of a wider pattern of torture and brutal treatment at American overseas detention centers, including those in [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt; Several scholars stated that the abuses constituted state-sanctioned crimes.&lt;ref name="Brown 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt;

The United States Department of Defense removed seventeen soldiers and officers from duty, and eleven soldiers were charged with [[dereliction of duty]], maltreatment, [[aggravated assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]]. Between May 2004, and March 2006, these soldiers were convicted in [[courts-martial]], sentenced to military prison, and [[dishonorable discharge|dishonorably discharged]] from service. Two soldiers, Specialist [[Charles Graner]] and PFC [[Lynndie England]], were sentenced to ten and three years in prison, respectively. [[Brigadier General]] [[Janis Karpinski]], the commanding officer of all detention facilities in Iraq, was reprimanded and demoted to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. Several more military personnel who were accused of perpetrating or authorizing the measures, including many of higher rank, were not prosecuted. It was reported that most inmates were innocent of the crimes they were accused of and were simply detained due to their being in the wrong place at the wrong time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/41786/1/1|title=Spuren der Gewalt|website=sueddeutsche.de|language=German|access-date=2017-07-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205042032/http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/41786/1/1|archivedate=December 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents popularly known as the [[Torture Memos]] came to light a few years later. These documents, prepared shortly before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by the [[United States Department of Justice]], authorized certain [[enhanced interrogation techniques]], generally held to involve torture of foreign detainees. The memoranda also argued that [[International law|international humanitarian laws]], such as the [[Geneva Conventions]], did not apply to American interrogators overseas. Several subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, including ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2006), have overturned Bush administration policy, and ruled that [[Geneva Conventions]] apply.

Many of the torture techniques used were developed at Guantánamo detention center, including prolonged isolation; the [[Frequent_flyer_program_(Guantanamo)|frequent flier program]], a sleep deprivation program whereby people were moved from cell to cell every few hours so they couldn't sleep for days, weeks, even months, short-shackling in painful positions; nudity; extreme use of heat and cold; the use of loud music and noise and preying on phobias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wikileaksdecrypted.com/guantanamo-torture-columbia-university/|title=Investigative Reporter Andy Worthington on Guantanamo Torture|website=wikileaksdecrypted.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220030351/http://wikileaksdecrypted.com/guantanamo-torture-columbia-university/|archivedate=December 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs?|date=January 2018}}

==Background==

===War on terror===
The [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States led to demands from the public that U.S. president George W. Bush take actions that would prevent further attacks.&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt; This pressure led to the launch of the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt;{{Better source needed|date=August 2018}} The fact that the perceived enemies in the War on Terror were stateless individuals, and the perceived threat of extreme strategies including [[suicide bombing]], led to a pressure on the Bush administration to act decisively.&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt; In addition, these tactics created the perception that the "legitimate" techniques used in the cold war would not be of much use. US vice-president [[Dick Cheney]] stated, for example, that the US "[had] to work sort of on the dark side",&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt; and that it had to "use any means at [its] disposal".&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt;

===Iraq War===
{{Main article|Iraq War}}

The [[Iraq War]] began in March 2003 as an invasion of [[Ba'athist Iraq]] by a force led by the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3661134.stm|title=Iraq war illegal, says Annan|publisher=|accessdate=September 16, 2014|work=BBC News|date=September 16, 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912171408/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3661134.stm|archivedate=September 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS-20040226"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/invasion/cron/ |title=A chronology of the six-week invasion of Iraq |date=February 26, 2004 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331235432/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/invasion/cron/ |archivedate=March 31, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ba'athist government led by [[Saddam Hussein]] was toppled within a month. This conflict was followed by a longer phase of fighting in which an insurgency emerged to oppose [[Multi-National Force&amp;nbsp;– Iraq|the occupying forces]] and the post-invasion Iraqi government.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq War|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/870845/Iraq-War|work=Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=October 27, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016074755/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/870845/Iraq-War|archivedate=October 16, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this insurgency, the United States was in the role of an [[Military occupation|occupying power]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

===Abu Ghraib prison===
{{Further information|Abu Ghraib prison}}
The [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in the town of [[Abu Ghraib]] was one of the most notorious prisons in Iraq during the government of Saddam Hussein. The prison was used to hold approximately 50,000 men and women in poor conditions, and torture and execution were frequent.&lt;ref name="Hersh 2004"/&gt; The prison was located on 280 acres of land 32 kilometers west of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="Fast facts"&gt;{{cite web|author=CNN Library|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/30/world/meast/iraq-prison-abuse-scandal-fast-facts/|title=Iraq Prison Abuse Scandal Fast Facts|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2016-03-12|accessdate=2016-09-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905090342/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/30/world/meast/iraq-prison-abuse-scandal-fast-facts/|archivedate=September 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse of Saddam Hussein's government, the prison was looted and everything that was removable was carried away. Following the invasion, the U.S. army refurbished it and turned it into a military prison.&lt;ref name="Hersh 2004"/&gt; It was the largest of several detention centers in Iraq used by the U.S. military.&lt;ref name="ASIL 2004"/&gt; In March 2004, during the time that the U.S. military was using the Abu Ghraib prison as a detention facility, it housed approximately 7,490 prisoners.&lt;ref name="Google Books"&gt;{{cite book|last=General (Dept. of the Army)|first=Inspector|title=Detainee Operations Inspection|year=2004|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=1-4289-1031-X|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three categories of prisoners were imprisoned at Abu Ghraib by the U.S. military. These were "common criminals," individuals suspected of being leaders of the insurgency, and individuals suspected of committing crimes against the occupational force led by the U.S.{{sfn|Hersh|2004|pp=20-21}} Although most prisoners lived in tents in the yard, the abuses took place inside cell blocks 1a and 1b.&lt;ref name="Fast facts"/&gt; The [[800th Military Police Brigade]], from [[Uniondale, New York|Uniondale]], New York, was responsible for running the prison.&lt;ref name="ASIL 2004"/&gt; The brigade was commanded by Brigadier General [[Janis Karpinski]], who was in charge of all of the U.S. run prisons in Iraq. She did not have previous experience in running a prison.{{sfn|Hersh|2004|pp=20-21}} The individuals who committed abuses at the prison were members of the [[372nd Military Police Company]], which was a constituent of the [[320th Military Police Battalion]], which was overseen by Karpinski's Brigade headquarters.{{sfn|Hersh|2004|p=22}}

The [[Fay Report]] noted that "contracting-related issues contributed to the problems at Abu Ghraib prison". Over half the interrogators working at the prison were employees of [[CACI International]], while [[Titan Corporation]] supplied linguistics personnel. In his report, General Fay notes that "The general policy of not contracting for intelligence functions and services was designed in part to avoid many of the problems that eventually developed at Abu Ghraib..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 16| pages = 25| last = Schooner| first = Steven L| title = Contractor Atrocities at Abu Ghraib: Compromised Accountability in a Streamlined, Outsourced Government| journal = Policy Review| url=https://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&amp;context=faculty_publications |date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003, [[Amnesty International]] published reports of human rights abuse by the [[U.S. military]] and its coalition partners at detention centers and prisons in Iraq.&lt;ref name="AI 2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/108000/mde141362003en.pdf |title=Iraq: Human rights must be foundation for rebuilding |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 20, 2003 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207002301/https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/108000/mde141362003en.pdf |archivedate=February 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These included reports of brutal treatment at [[Abu Ghraib prison]], which had once been used by the government of [[Saddam Hussein]], and had been taken over by the United States after the invasion. On June 20, 2003, Abdel Salam Sidahmed, Deputy Director of AI's Middle East Program, described an uprising by the prisoners against the conditions of their detention, saying "The notorious Abu Ghraib Prison, centre of torture and mass executions under Saddam Hussein, is yet again a prison cut off from the outside world. On 13 June there was a protest in this prison against indefinite detention without trial. Troops from the occupying powers killed one person and wounded seven."&lt;ref name="AI 2003"/&gt;

On July 23, 2003, Amnesty International issued a press release condemning widespread human rights abuses by U.S. and coalition forces. The release stated that prisoners had been exposed to extreme heat, not provided clothing, and forced to use open trenches for toilets. They had also been tortured, with the methods including denial of sleep for extended periods, exposure to bright lights and loud music, and being restrained in uncomfortable positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnesty.nl/nieuwsportaal/pers/continuing-failure-uphold-human-rights |title=Iraq: Continuing failure to uphold human rights |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 23, 2003 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207004452/http://www.amnesty.nl/nieuwsportaal/pers/continuing-failure-uphold-human-rights |archivedate=February 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2003, the [[Associated Press]] presented a special report on the massive human rights abuses at Abu Ghraib. Their report began; "In Iraq's American detention camps, forbidden talk can earn a prisoner hours bound and stretched out in the sun, and detainees swinging tent poles rise up regularly against their jailers, according to recently released Iraqis." The report went on to describe abuse of the prisoners at the hands of their American captors: "'They confined us like sheep,' the newly freed Saad Naif, 38, said of the Americans. 'They hit people. They humiliated people.'" In response, U.S. Brigadier-General Janis Karpinski, at the time in charge of all U.S. detention facilities in Iraq, claimed that prisoners were being treated "humanely and fairly."&lt;ref name="AP 2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/world/iraq/20031101-0936-iraq-thecamps.html |title=AP Enterprise: Former Iraqi detainees tell of riots, punishment in the sun, good Americans and pitiless ones |last1=Hanley |first1=Charles J. |last2= |first2= |date=November 1, 2003 |website=utsandiego.com |publisher=San Diego Union Tribune |accessdate=April 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503221406/http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/world/iraq/20031101-0936-iraq-thecamps.html |archivedate=May 3, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP report also stated that as of November 1, 2003, there were two legal cases pending against U.S. military personnel, one involving the beating of an Iraqi prisoner, the other about the death of a prisoner in custody.&lt;ref name="AP 2003"/&gt;

Since the beginning of the invasion, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) had been allowed to oversee the prison, and submitted reports about the treatment of the prisoners. In response to an ICRC report, Brigadier General [[Janis Karpinski]], who oversaw all US detention facilities in Iraq, stated that several of the prisoners were intelligence assets, and therefore not entitled to complete protection under the [[Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name="ASIL 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|title=U.S. Abuse of Iraqi Detainees at Abu Ghraib Prison|journal=The American Journal of International Law|date=July 2004|volume=98|issue=3|pages=591–596|jstor=3181656}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRC reports led to Lieutenant General [[Ricardo Sanchez]], the commander of the Iraqi task force, appointing Major General [[Antonio Taguba]] to investigate the allegations on 1 January 2004.&lt;ref name="ASIL 2004"/&gt; Taguba submitted his findings (the [[Taguba Report]]) in February 2004, stating that "numerous incidents of sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on several detainees. This systemic and illegal abuse of detainees was intentionally perpetrated by several members of the military police guard force."&lt;ref name="ASIL 2004"/&gt; The report stated that there was widespread evidence of this abuse, including photographic evidence. The report was not released publicly.&lt;ref name="Hersh 2004"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hersh |first=Seymour |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/10/torture-at-abu-ghraib |title=Torture at Abu Ghraib |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801141211/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/10/torture-at-abu-ghraib |archivedate=August 1, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The abuse was also perpetrated by three female military officers shown in the images on this page, where they received a wide range of attention and were convicted later on along with other several members. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mothers, Monsters, Whores|last=Sjoberg|first=Laura|last2=Gentry|first2=Caron E.|publisher=Zed Books|year=2007|isbn=978-1-84277-866-1|location=New York, USA|pages=58–87|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

The scandal came to widespread public attention In April 2004, when a ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' news report was aired on April 28 by [[CBS News]], describing the abuse, including pictures showing military personnel taunting naked prisoners.&lt;ref name=Smeulers/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASIL 2004"/&gt;{{sfn|Greenberg|Dretel|2005|p=xiii}}&lt;ref name="Fast facts"/&gt; An article was published by [[Seymour M.

Shortly afterwards, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] stated that the individuals responsible would be "brought to justice," while United Nations General Secretary [[Kofi Annan]] said that the effort to reconstruct a government in Iraq had been badly damaged.&lt;ref name="ASIL 2004"/&gt;

===Executive Order===
On December 21, 2004, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] released copies of internal memoranda from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] that it had obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. These discussed torture and abuse at prisons in [[Guantanamo Bay]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]]. One memorandum dated May 22, 2004 was from an individual described as the "On Scene Commander – Baghdad," but whose name had been redacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/FBI.121504.4940_4941.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309123054/http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/FBI.121504.4940_4941.pdf |archivedate=March 9, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This individual referred explicitly to an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] that sanctioned the use of extraordinary interrogation tactics by U.S. military personnel. The torture methods sanctioned included sleep deprivation, [[hooding]] prisoners, playing loud music, removing all detainees' clothing, forcing them to stand in so-called "stress positions", and the use of dogs. The author also stated that [[the Pentagon]] had limited use of the techniques by requiring specific authorization from the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]. The author identifies "physical beatings, sexual humiliation or touching" as being outside the Executive Order.

Documents obtained by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the ACLU showed that [[Ricardo Sanchez]], who was a Lieutenant General and the senior U.S. military officer in Iraq, authorized the use of military dogs, temperature extremes, reversed sleep patterns, and sensory deprivation as interrogation methods in Abu Ghraib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35612-2004Jun11.html | title=General Granted Latitude At Prison | date=June 12, 2004 | work=The Washington Post | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808011210/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35612-2004Jun11.html | archivedate=August 8, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A November 2004 report by Brigadier General Richard Formica found that many troops at the Abu Ghraib prison had been following orders based on a memorandum from Sanchez, and that the abuse had not been carried out by isolated "criminal" elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wrong advice blamed for US abuse |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5090372.stm |work=BBC NEWS AMERICAS |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=June 17, 2006 |accessdate=February 3, 2007 |quote="[...] most defendants say they were following orders." | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070104045041/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5090372.stm| archivedate= January 4, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACLU lawyer Amrit Singh said in a statement from the union that "General Sanchez authorized interrogation techniques that were in clear violation of the Geneva Conventions and the army's own standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US memo shows Iraq jail methods |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4392519.stm |work=BBC NEWS AMERICAS |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=March 30, 2005 |accessdate=February 3, 2007 |quote="The top US general in Iraq authorised interrogation techniques including the use of dogs, stress positions and disorientation, a memo has shown." |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526082709/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4392519.stm |archivedate=May 26, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an interview for her hometown newspaper ''The Signal'', Karpinski stated that she had seen unreleased documents from Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] which authorized the use of these tactics on Iraqi prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Leon Worden |url= http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/iraq/sg070204.htm | title= Karpinski: Rumsfeld OK'd Methods at Abu Ghraib | publisher= [[Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society]] | accessdate=July 4, 2004| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040704031819/http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/iraq/sg070204.htm| archivedate= July 4, 2004 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged authorization from Donald Rumsfeld===
A 2004 report by the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' stated that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had authorized the interrogation tactics used in Abu Ghraib, and which had previously been used by the US in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-05-16/rumsfeld-approved-iraq-interrogation-methods-report/1976460 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010221210/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-05-16/rumsfeld-approved-iraq-interrogation-methods-report/1976460 |archivedate=October 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, Janis Karpinski, who had been in charge of Abu Ghraib prison until early 2004, told Spain's ''[[El País (Madrid)|El País]]'' newspaper that she had seen a letter signed by Rumsfeld, which allowed civilian contractors to use techniques such as [[sleep deprivation]] during interrogation. "The methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation ... playing music at full volume, having to sit in uncomfortably ... Rumsfeld authorized these specific techniques."&lt;ref name="Reuters 2006"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-rumsfeld-idUSL2572641320061125|title=Rumsfeld okayed abuses says former U.S. general|work=Reuters|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=25 November 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917162407/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-rumsfeld-idUSL2572641320061125|archivedate=September 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karpinski, the handwritten signature was above his printed name, and the comment "Make sure this is accomplished" was in the margin in the same hand-writing.&lt;ref name="Reuters 2006"/&gt; Neither the Pentagon nor U.S. Army spokespeople in Iraq commented on the accusation. In 2006, a criminal complaint was filed in a German Court against Donald Rumsfeld by eight former soldiers and intelligence operatives, including Karpinski and former army counterintelligence special agent David DeBatto. Among other things, the complaint stated that Rumsfeld both knew of and authorized enhanced interrogation techniques that he knew to be illegal under international law.&lt;ref name="Reuters 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/german-war-crimes-complaint-against-donald-rumsfeld%2C-et-al. |title=German Criminal Complaint Against Donald Rumsfeld |publisher=CCR |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516075342/http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/german-war-crimes-complaint-against-donald-rumsfeld%2C-et-al. |archivedate=May 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L25726413.htm |title=– "Rumsfeld okayed abuses says former U.S. Army general" Reuters News |publisher=Alertnet.org |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109025627/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L25726413.htm |archivedate=November 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.classactionworld.com/cases/german-war-crimes-litigation-against-donald-rumsfeld-et-al | title=German Court War Crimes Litigation Against Donald Rumsfeld | publisher=Class Action World | accessdate=March 31, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070816/http://www.classactionworld.com/cases/german-war-crimes-litigation-against-donald-rumsfeld-et-al | archivedate=April 7, 2014 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/german-war-crimes-complaint-against-donald-rumsfeld%2C-et-al. |title=German Case Again Donald Rumsfeld filed by CCR |publisher=Center for Constitutional Rights |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516075342/http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/german-war-crimes-complaint-against-donald-rumsfeld%2C-et-al. |archivedate=May 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported evidence given by Ameen Saeed Al-Sheik, detainee No. 151362. It quoted him as saying; "They said we will make you wish to die and it will not happen [...] They stripped me naked. One of them told me he would rape me.

===Systematic torture===
[[File:Abu Ghraib 64.jpg|thumb|A detainee handcuffed in the nude to a bed with female [[panties]] soaked in urine covering his face.]]

On May 7, 2004, [[Pierre Krähenbühl]], Operations Director for the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC), stated that inspection visits made by the ICRC to detention centers run by the U.S. and its allies showed that acts of prisoner abuse were not isolated acts, but were part of a "pattern and a broad system." He went on to say that some of the incidents they had observed were "tantamount to torture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3694521.stm | title=Red Cross saw 'widespread abuse' | date=May 8, 2004 | work=BBC News | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040722000029/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3694521.stm | archivedate=July 22, 2004 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed forces in the U.S. and the UK are jointly trained in techniques known as ''[[R2I|resistance to interrogation]] (R2I)'' techniques. These R2I techniques are taught ostensibly to help soldiers cope with, or resist, torture if they are captured. On May 8, 2004, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that according to a former British special forces officer, the acts committed by the Abu Ghraib prison military personnel resembled the techniques used in R2I training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12956,1212199,00.html | location=London | title=UK forces taught torture methods | date=May 8, 2004 | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Leigh | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040530070404/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12956,1212199,00.html | archivedate=May 30, 2004 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same report stated that:
{{Quote|The US commander in charge of military jails in Iraq, Major General [[Geoffrey Miller (general)|Geoffrey Miller]], has confirmed that a battery of 50-odd special "coercive techniques" can be used against enemy detainees.

Historian [[Alfred W. McCoy]], who authored a book on torture in the Philippines armed forces, noted similarities in the abusive treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and the techniques described in the [[KUBARK|KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation manual]] published by the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in 1963. He asserts that what he calls "the CIA's no-touch torture methods" have been in continuous use by the CIA and the U.S. military intelligence since that time.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Alfred W.

When the U.S. military first acknowledged the abuse in early 2004, much of the [[Media of the United States|United States media]] once again showed little initial interest. On January 16, 2004, the [[United States Central Command]] informed the media that an official investigation had begun involving abuse and [[humiliation]] of Iraqi detainees by a group of U.S. soldiers. On February 24, it was reported that 17 soldiers had been suspended.

In late April 2004, the U.S. television news-magazine ''[[60 Minutes II]]'', a franchise of [[CBS]], broadcast a story on the abuse. The story included photographs depicting the abuse of prisoners.&lt;ref name="main614063.shtml"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/27/60II/main614063.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Abuse Of Iraqi POWs By GIs Probed | date=April 27, 2004 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208135011/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/27/60II/main614063.shtml | archivedate=February 8, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The news segment was delayed by two weeks at the request of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[Richard Myers]], an air force general and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. After learning that ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine planned to publish an article and photographs on the topic in its next issue, CBS proceeded to broadcast its report on April 28.&lt;ref name="zmag itemID 7926"/&gt; In the CBS report, [[Dan Rather]] interviewed then-deputy director of Coalition operations in Iraq, Brigadier General [[Mark Kimmitt]], who said:

{{Quote|The first thing I'd say is we're appalled as well. These are our fellow soldiers. These are the people we work with every day, and they represent us. They wear the same uniform as us, and they let their fellow soldiers down [...] Our soldiers could be taken prisoner as well. And we expect our soldiers to be treated well by the adversary, by the enemy. And if we can't hold ourselves up as an example of how to treat people with dignity and respect [...] We can't ask that other nations do that to our soldiers as well. [...] So what would I tell the people of Iraq? This is wrong. This is reprehensible. But this is not representative of the 150,000 soldiers that are over here [...] I'd say the same thing to the American people ... Don't judge your army based on the actions of a few.''&lt;ref name="main614063.shtml" /&gt;''}}

Kimmitt also acknowledged that he knew of other cases of abuse during the American occupation of Iraq.&lt;ref name="main614063.shtml"/&gt; Bill Cowan, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, was also interviewed, and said: "We went into Iraq to stop things like this from happening, and indeed, here they are happening under our tutelage."&lt;ref name="main614063.shtml"/&gt; In addition, Rather interviewed Army Reserve Staff Sergeant [[Ivan Frederick]], who was party to some of the abuses. Frederick's civilian job was as a corrections officer at a Virginia prison. He said, "We had no support, no training whatsoever. And I kept asking my chain of command for certain things ... like rules and regulations, and it just wasn't happening."&lt;ref name="main614063.shtml"/&gt; Frederick's video diary, sent home from Iraq, provided some of the images used in the story. In it he listed detailed, dated, entries that chronicled abuse of CIA prisoners, as well as their names: "The next day the medics came in and put his body on a stretcher, placed a fake [intravenous drip] in his arm and took him away. This [CIA prisoner] was never processed and therefore never had a number."&lt;ref name="shane"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-05-01/news/0405010122_1_prisoner-military-intelligence-cells|title=Soldier's diary details wider abuse at prison - Baltimore Sun|last=Shane|first=Scott|date=May 1, 2004|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=March 5, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610195115/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-05-01/news/0405010122_1_prisoner-military-intelligence-cells|archivedate=June 10, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick implicated the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Military Intelligence Corps]] as well, saying "MI has been present and witnessed such activity. MI has encouraged and told us great job [and] that they were now getting positive results and information."&lt;ref name="shane"/&gt;

===''New Yorker'' article, 2004===
In 2004, [[Seymour M. Hersh]] published an article in ''The New Yorker'' magazine discussing the abuses in detail, and used as its source a copy of the Taguba report. Under the direction of editor [[David Remnick]], the magazine also posted a report on its website by Hersh, along with a number of images of the torture taken by U.S. military prison guards. The article, entitled "Torture at Abu Ghraib", was followed in the next two weeks by two further articles on the same subject, "Chain of Command" and "The Gray Zone", also by Hersh.&lt;ref name="zmag itemID 7926"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=7926 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090701041008/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=7926 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 1, 2009 |title=ZNet &amp;#124;Iraq &amp;#124; Abu Ghraib |publisher=Zmag.org |accessdate=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later coverage, 2006===
In February 2006, previously unreleased photos and videos were broadcast by [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]], an Australian television network, on its [[Dateline (Australian TV program)|''Dateline'']] program. The Bush administration attempted to prevent release of the images in the U.S., arguing that their publication could provoke antagonism. These newly released photographs depicted prisoners crawling on the floor naked, being forced to perform sexual acts, and being covered in feces. Some images also showed prisoners killed by the soldiers, some shot in the head and some with slit throats. BBC World News stated that one of the prisoners, who was reportedly mentally unstable, was considered by prison guards as a "pet" for torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://smh.com.au/news/world/the-photos-america-doesnt-want-seen/2006/02/14/1139890737099.html# |title=The photos America doesn't want seen – World – |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |date=February 15, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412221602/http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/the-photos-america-doesnt-want-seen/2006/02/14/1139890737099.html |archivedate=April 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN expressed hope that the pictures would be investigated immediately, but the Pentagon stated that the images "have been previously investigated as part of the Abu Ghraib investigation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18166472-26619,00.html Anger at Abu Ghraib photos | NEWS.com.au&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107133700/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C10117%2C18166472-26619%2C00.html |date=November 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2006, [[Salon (website)|Salon]] published what was then the most extensive documentation of the abuse.&lt;ref name="Salon 2006"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/introduction/index.html |title=Abu Ghraib Files – Salon.com News |publisher=Salon.com |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916223055/http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/introduction/index.html/ |archivedate=September 16, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report accessed by Salon included the following summary of the material: "A review of all the computer media submitted to this office revealed a total of 1,325 images of suspected detainee abuse, 93 video files of suspected detainee abuse, 660 images of adult pornography, 546 images of suspected dead Iraqi detainees, 29 images of soldiers in simulated sexual acts, 20 images of a soldier with a Swastika drawn between his eyes, 37 images of Military Working dogs being used in abuse of detainees and 125 images of questionable acts."&lt;ref name="Salon 2006"/&gt;

=== Iraqi response ===
[[File:Abu ghraib nakedhang 06.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|A naked Iraqi detainee hanged upside down for long hours.]]
The news website [[AsiaNews]] quoted Yahia Said, an Iraqi scholar at the [[London School of Economics]], as saying: "The reception [of the news about Abu Ghraib] was surprisingly low-key in Iraq. Part of the reason was that rumors and tall stories, as well as true stories, about abuse, mass rape, and torture in the jails and in coalition custody have been going round for a long time. So compared to what people have been talking about here the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: why did they come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there's some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point."&lt;ref name=iraqreaction1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l%3Den%26art%3D791 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134347/http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=791 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]] reporter [[Ben Wedeman]] reported that Iraqi reaction to George W. Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was "mixed": "Some people react[ed] positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished. On the other hand, there are many others who says it simply isn't enough, that they—many people noted that there was not a frank apology from the president for this incident. And, in fact, I have a Baghdad newspaper with me right now from—it's called 'Dar-es-Salaam.' That's from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party. It says that an apology is not enough for the torture [...] of Iraqi prisoners."&lt;ref name=cnnreaction&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0405/06/lad.04.html|title=''Live At Daybreak''|publisher=|accessdate=September 16, 2014|work=CNN|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610203109/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0405/06/lad.04.html|archivedate=June 10, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley A. McChrystal|General Stanley McChrystal]], who held several command positions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said that, "In my experience, we found that nearly every first-time jihadist claimed Abu Ghraib had first jolted him into action."{{sfn|McChrystal|2013|p=172}} He also said that, "mistreating detainees would discredit us. ... The pictures [from] Abu Ghraib represented a setback for America's efforts in Iraq. Simultaneously undermining U.S. domestic confidence in the way in which America was operating, and creating or reinforcing negative perceptions worldwide of American values, it fueled violence".{{sfn|McChrystal|2013|pp=200-201}}

On May 7, 2004 [[Nick Berg]], an American businessman who went to Iraq after the [[History of Iraq (2003–11)|US Invasion]], was captured and decapitated by the Islamist militant organization [[Muntada al-Ansar|al-Ansars]] in response to Abu Ghraib.&lt;ref&gt;A book on "torture doctors" stated, "Television carried the Abu Ghraib photographs on April 28, 2004.  The first of [[w:Beheading video|eleven beheadings in Iraq]] occurred twelve days later."  {{Citation | last = Miles| first = Steven H. | author-link = Steven H. Miles| year = 2009| title = Oath Betrayed:  American's Torture Doctors | publisher = U. of California Pr. | page = 162| isbn = 978-0-520-25968-3}} The Wikipedia article on [[w:Beheading video|"Beheading video"]] is a close but imperfect match for this quote from Miles.  On 2015-11-27, this Wikipedia article listed a beheading in Paikistan almost 27 months before the Abu Ghraib revelations.  It then lists 10 beheadings in the next 6 months.  The next video is just over 4 years later on Feb. 7, 2009 in Pakistan, possibly before Miles' completed his book.  This count of beheadings seems consistent with Miles' comment, even if it does not match perfectly.  Miles continues, "Pursuing justice differs from being consumed by revenge.  The former proceeds from crime to investigation, to trial, to punishment, and then to closure.  Vengeance is a whirlwind, where atrocity justifies revenge, and revenge becomes an atrocity."&lt;/ref&gt; The masked man who carried out the execution is believed to have been [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]].

===Response of U.S. government===
The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] did not initially acknowledge the abuses at Abu Ghraib. After the pictures were published and the evidence became incontrovertible, the initial reaction from the administration characterized the scandal as an isolated incident uncharacteristic of U.S. actions in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt; Bush described the abuses as the actions of a few individuals, who were disregarding the values of the US.&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt; This view was widely disputed, notably in Arab countries. In addition, the [[International Red Cross]] had been making representations about abuse of prisoners for more than a year before the scandal broke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf |title=Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the Treatment by the Coalition Forces of Prisoners of War and Other Protected Persons by the Geneva Conventions in Iraq During Arrest, Internment and Interrogation |publisher=ICRC |date=February 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513090151/http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars studying the abuses have stated that the abuses were part of a widespread pattern. Vice-president [[Dick Cheney]]'s office had played a central role in eliminating limits on coercion in U.S. custody, commissioning and defending legal opinions that the administration later portrayed as the initiatives of lower-ranking officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/cheney/chapters/pushing_the_envelope_on_presi/|title=Pushing the Envelope on Presidential Power|publisher=|accessdate=September 16, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 2004, United States Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] stated in a hearing before the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]]:

{{Quote|These events occurred on my watch. As Secretary of Defense, I am accountable for them. I take full responsibility. It is my obligation to evaluate what happened, to make sure those who have committed wrongdoing are brought to justice, and to make changes as needed to see that it doesn't happen again. I feel terrible about what happened to these Iraqi detainees. They are human beings. They were in U.S. custody. Our country had an obligation to treat them right. We didn't do that. That was wrong. To those Iraqis who were mistreated by members of U.S. armed forces, I offer my deepest apology. It was un-American. And it was inconsistent with the values of our nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://italy.usembassy.gov/viewer/article.asp?article=/file2004_05/alia/a4050713.htm |title=Rumsfeld Apologizes to Iraqis Abused by U.

He also commented on the very existence of the evidence of abuse:
{{Quote|We're functioning in a – with peacetime restraints, with legal requirements in a wartime situation, in the information age, where people are running around with digital cameras and taking these unbelievable photographs and then passing them off, against the law, to the media, to our surprise, when they had not even arrived in the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Washington |first=The |url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040507-115901-6736r.htm |title=Washington Times – Iraq prisoner abuse 'un-American,' says Rumsfeld |publisher=Washtimes.com |date=May 7, 2004 |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613172647/http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040507-115901-6736r.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rumsfeld was careful to draw a distinction between abuse and [[torture]]: "What has been charged so far is abuse, which I believe technically is different from torture. I'm not going to address the 'torture' word."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nytimes.com/2004/05/23/opinion/23HOCH.html|title=What's in a Word?

Several senators commented on Rumsfeld's testimony. [[Lindsey Graham]] stated that "the American public needs to understand we're talking about rape and murder here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/08/iraq/main616338.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Rumsfeld: Worst Still To Come | date=May 8, 2004 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630151502/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/08/iraq/main616338.shtml | archivedate=June 30, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norm Coleman]] said that "It was pretty disgusting, not what you'd expect from Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpers.org/WeeklyReview2004-05-18.html |title="Weekly Review" by Roger D.

[[James Inhofe]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services]], stated that the events were being blown out of proportion: "I'm probably not the only one up at this table that is more outraged by the outrage than we are by the treatment [...] [They] are not there for traffic violations. [...] these prisoners—they're murderers, they're terrorists, they're insurgents. [...] Many of them probably have American blood on their hands. And here we're so concerned about the treatment of those individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/05/11/inhofe.abuse/|publisher=CNN|title=GOP senator labels abused prisoners 'terrorists'|date=May 12, 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515180052/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/05/11/inhofe.abuse/|archivedate=May 15, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2004, [[Al Gore]] gave a sharply critical speech on the scandal and the Iraq War. He called for the resignations of Rumsfeld, [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], CIA Director [[George Tenet]], Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Paul Wolfowitz]], Under Secretary of Defense for Policy [[Douglas J. Feith]], and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence [[Stephen A. Cambone]], for encouraging policies that led to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and fanned hatred of Americans abroad. Gore also called the Bush administration's Iraq war plan "incompetent" and described Bush as the most dishonest president since [[Richard Nixon]]. Gore commented; "In Iraq, what happened at that prison, it is now clear, is not the result of random acts of a few bad apples. It was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moveonpac.org/goreremarks052604.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040609101212/http://www.moveonpac.org/goreremarks052604.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 9, 2004 |title=MoveOn PAC |publisher=MoveOn PAC |accessdate=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumsfeld was also criticized by both Republican and Democrat lawmakers, including Senators [[John Kerry]], and [[Joe Biden]], and [[House Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]].

The revelations were also the impetus for the creation of the [[Fay Report]], named for its lead author [[George Fay]], as well as the [[Taguba Report]].

===United States media===
[[File:RumsfeldEconomist.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A headline from ''The Economist'', calling for Secretary Rumsfeld's resignation]]

Several periodicals, including ''The New York Times'' and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', called for Rumsfeld's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rumsfeld must go|date=May 7, 2004|work=Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2004/05/07/rumsfeld_must_go/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040602215537/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2004/05/07/rumsfeld_must_go/|archivedate=June 2, 2004|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of ''[[The Economist]]'', which had backed President Bush in the 2000 election, carried a photo of the abuse with the words "Resign, Rumsfeld."

Right-wing radio host [[Rush Limbaugh]] contended that the events were being blown out of proportion, stating that "this is no different than what happens at the [[Skull and Bones]] initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time.

==Repercussions==

===Convictions of soldiers===
[[File:Navy consolidated brig -- Mirimar CA.jpg|thumb|[[Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar]], where [[Lynndie England|England]] and Harman served their sentences]]

Eleven soldiers were convicted of various charges relating to the incidents, with all of the convictions including the charge of [[dereliction of duty]]. Most soldiers only received minor sentences. Three other soldiers were either cleared of charges or were not charged. No one was convicted for the murders of the detainees.

* Colonel [[Thomas Pappas]] was relieved of his command on May 13, 2005, after receiving [[non-judicial punishment]] for two instances of dereliction of duty, including that of allowing dogs to be present during interrogations. He was fined $8000 under the provisions of Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (non-judicial punishment). He also received a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand which effectively ended his military career. He did not face criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/may/12/20050512-111801-2679r/ |title=Colonel loses command for abuses |publisher=Washington Times |date=12 May 2005 |accessdate=2016-08-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809110733/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/may/12/20050512-111801-2679r/ |archivedate=August 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

===International law===

The United States has ratified the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]] and the [[Third Geneva Convention|Third]] and [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]s. The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] took the position that: "Both the United States and Iraq are parties to the Geneva Conventions. The United States recognizes that these treaties are binding in the war for the 'liberation of Iraq'".&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Gonzales, OP-ED: "The Rule of Law and the Rules of War", ''New York Times'', May 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Abu Ghraib 22.jpg|thumb|A U.S. soldier beats a bleeding Iraqi detainee]]

The Convention Against Torture defines [[torture]] in the following terms:
{{Quote|For the purposes of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person, information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.|[[United Nations Convention Against Torture]]|(Article 1)}}
[[File:Abu Ghraib 29.JPG|thumb|upright=0.5|A nude prisoner used as a target for shooting practice by U.S. soldiers.]]

According to [[Human Rights Watch]]:
{{quote|Al-Qaeda detainees would likely not be accorded [[Prisoner of War]] (POW) status, but the Conventions still provide explicit protections to all persons held in an international armed conflict, even if they are not entitled to POW status. Such protections include the right to be free from coercive interrogation, to receive a fair trial if charged with a criminal offense, and, in the case of detained civilians, to be able to appeal periodically the security rationale for continued detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/12123/section/3 |title="The Road to Abu Ghraib", Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=June 9, 2004 |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011111447/http://www.hrw.org/en/node/12123/section/3 |archivedate=October 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) concluded in its confidential February 2004 report to the Coalition Forces (CF) that it had documented 
{{quote|serious violations of International Humanitarian Law relating to the conditions of treatment of the persons deprived of their liberty held by the CF in Iraq. In particular, it establishes that persons deprived of their liberty face the risk of being subjected to a process of physical and psychological coercion, in some cases tantamount to torture, in the early stages of the internment process.&lt;ref name="ICRC04report"/&gt;}}

There were several major violations described in the ICRC report. These included brutality against protected persons upon capture and initial custody, sometimes causing death or serious injury; absence of notification of arrest of persons deprived of their liberty to their families causing distress among persons deprived of their liberty and their families; physical or psychological coercion during interrogation to secure information; prolonged solitary confinement in cells devoid of daylight; excessive and disproportionate use of force against persons deprived of their liberty resulting in death or injury during their period of internment.&lt;ref name="ICRC04report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf |title=Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the Treatment by the Coalition Forces of Prisoners of War and Other Protected Persons by the Geneva Conventions in Iraq During Arrest, Internment and Interrogation (section 3.1) |publisher=ICRC |date=February 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513090151/http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf |archivedate=May 13, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some legal experts have said that the United States could be obligated to try some of its soldiers for [[war crimes]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war and civilians detained in a war may not be treated in a degrading manner, and violation of that section is a "grave breach". In a November 5, 2003 report on prisons in Iraq, the Army's provost marshal, Maj. Gen. Donald J. Ryder, stated that the conditions under which prisoners were held sometimes violated the Geneva Conventions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===United Nations resolution 1546===
In December 2005, John Pace, human rights chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), criticized the U.S. military's practice of holding Iraqi prisoners in Iraqi facilities such as Abu Ghraib. Pace stated that this practice was not mandated by UN Resolution 1546, according to which the U.S. government has claimed a legal mandate permitting its ongoing occupation of Iraq. Pace said, "All except those held by the Ministry of Justice are, technically speaking, held against the law because the Ministry of Justice is the only authority that is empowered by law to detain, to hold anybody in prison. Essentially none of these people have any real recourse to protection and therefore we speak ... of a total breakdown in the protection of the individual in this country."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Age'', December 6, 2005, {{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/america-abusing-mandate-in-iraq/2005/12/05/1133631201911.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516033839/http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/america-abusing-mandate-in-iraq/2005/12/05/1133631201911.html |archivedate=May 16, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture Memos===
[[Alberto Gonzales]] and other senior administration lawyers argued that detainees at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] and other similar prisons should be considered "[[unlawful combatant]]s" and were not protected by the [[Geneva Conventions]]. These opinions were issued in multiple memoranda, known today as the "[[Torture Memos]]," in August 2002, by the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] (OLC) in the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/02/23/yoo/index_np.html |title=Walter Shapiro, "Parsing pain" |publisher= |accessdate=September 16, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307223219/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/02/23/yoo/index_np.html |archivedate=March 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were written by [[John Yoo]], deputy assistant attorney-general in the OLC, and two of three were signed by his boss [[Jay Bybee|Jay S. Bybee]]. (The latter was appointed as a federal judge in 2003, starting March 21, 2003.) An additional memo was issued on March 14, 2003, after the resignation of Bybee, and just prior to the American invasion of Iraq. In it, Yoo concluded that federal laws prohibiting the use of torture did not apply to U.S. practices overseas.&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/04/05/a-top-pentagon-lawyer-faces-a-senate-grilling-on-torture.html|title=A Top Pentagon Lawyer Faces a Senate Grilling On Torture|publisher=|accessdate=September 16, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115012641/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/04/05/a-top-pentagon-lawyer-faces-a-senate-grilling-on-torture.html|archivedate=January 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzales observed that denying coverage under the Geneva Conventions, "substantially reduces the threat of domestic criminal prosecution under the [[War Crimes Act of 1996|War Crimes Act]]."&lt;ref name="Holtzman"/&gt; Congressman [[Elizabeth Holtzman]] wrote that Gonzales's statement suggested that policy was crafted to ensure that the actions of U.S. officials could not be considered [[war crimes]].&lt;ref name="Holtzman"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050718&amp;s=holtzman Elizabeth Holtzman, "Torture and Accountability"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311055805/http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050718&amp;s=holtzman |date=March 11, 2007 }}, ''[[The Nation]]'', posted June 28, 2005 (July 18, 2005 issue) about The Geneva Convention &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/30/1333214 |title=Former NY Congress member Holtzman Calls For President Bush and His Senior Staff To Be Held Accountable for Abu Ghraib Torture |work=Democracy Now! |accessdate=September 16, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114040412/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05%2F06%2F30%2F1333214 |archivedate=November 14, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4999734/ Michael Isikoff, "Memos Reveal War Crimes Warnings"], '' Newsweek'', May 19, 2004 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920053941/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4999734/ |date=September 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/attack/law/2003/0128uslawyers.htm|title=US Lawyers Warn Bush on War Crimes|publisher=|accessdate=September 16, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718210406/https://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/attack/law/2003/0128uslawyers.htm|archivedate=July 18, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other legal proceedings===
In ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2006), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] ruled that Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions applied to all detainees in the [[War on Terror]]. It said that the [[Guantanamo military commission|military tribunals]] used to try these suspects were in violation of U.S. and international law. It said that the president could not unilaterally establish such tribunals, and that Congress needed to authorize a means by which detainees could confront their accusers and challenge their detention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13773997/site/newsweek/ Michael Isikoff and Stuart Taylor Jr., "The Gitmo Fallout: The fight over the Hamdan ruling heats up—as fears about its reach escalate"], ''Newsweek,'' July 17, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512175803/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13773997/site/newsweek/ |date=May 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeals of lawsuits from a group of 250 Iraqis who wanted to sue [[CACI]] International Inc. and [[Titan Corporation|Titan Corp.]] (now a subsidiary of [[L3 Technologies|L-3 Communications]]), the two private contractors at Abu Ghraib, over claims of abuse by interrogators and translators at the prison. The suits had been dismissed by the lower courts on the grounds that the companies held a derivative sovereign immunity from suits based on their status as government contractors pursuant to a battle-field preemption doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/politico/article/SCOTUS-nixes-Iraqis-lawsuit-1441885.php | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | title=SCOTUS nixes Iraqis' lawsuit | date=June 27, 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018012323/http://www.seattlepi.com/national/politico/article/SCOTUS-nixes-Iraqis-lawsuit-1441885.php | archivedate=October 18, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2011/06/28/us-supreme-court-refuses-to-allow-abu-ghraib-torture-victims-to-sue-military-contractors/ |title=US Supreme Court Refuses to Allow Abu Ghraib Torture Victims to Sue Military Contractors |publisher=Andy Worthington |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502195241/http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2011/06/28/us-supreme-court-refuses-to-allow-abu-ghraib-torture-victims-to-sue-military-contractors/ |archivedate=May 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] announced it was opening a grand jury investigation into CIA torture which killed a prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnj.com/article/20110614/NEWS01/110614017/CIA-errors-falling-under-scrutiny-again ]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/news/justice-opens-grand-jury-on-cia-detainee-s-death-1.2956098 "Justice opens grand jury on CIA detainee's death"], ''Newsday''.

In June 2014, the U.S. court of appeals in Richmond, Virginia, found that an 18th-century law known as the [[Alien Tort Statute]], allowed non-US citizens access to U.S. courts for violations of "the law of nations or a treaty of the United States". This would enable abused Iraqis to file suit against contractor CACI International. Employees of CACI International are being accused of encouraging torture and abuse as well as taking part in it as the four Iraqi's contend that they were "repeatedly shot in the head with a taser gun", "beaten on the genitals with a stick", and forced to watch the "rape [of] a female detainee", during their time at the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/30/iraq-lawsuit-defense-contractor-torture-abu-graib|title=Abu Ghraib torture suit against contractor revived by federal court - Law - theguardian.com|author=Spencer Ackerman|work=the Guardian|accessdate=September 16, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805225638/http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/30/iraq-lawsuit-defense-contractor-torture-abu-graib|archivedate=August 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==
On October 29, 2007, the memoir of a soldier stationed in Abu Ghraib, Iraq from 2005 to 2006 was published. ''[[Torture Central]]'' chronicled many events previously unreported in the news media, including torture that continued at Abu Ghraib over a year after the abuse photos were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torturecentral.com| title=Torture Central| author=Michael Keller|year=2007| accessdate=November 11, 2007| publisher=iUniverse| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071123092432/http://www.torturecentral.com/| archivedate= November 23, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the last of the prisons were turned over to the Iraqi government to run. An [[Associated Press]] article said {{quote|Despite Abu Ghraib- or perhaps because of reforms in its wake- prisoners have more recently said they receive far better treatment in American custody than in Iraqi jails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Sameer | last=Yacoub | title=Changing of the guard at last U.S. run prison | url=| publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 8A | date=July 15, 2010 | id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 2010, [[Amnesty International]] warned in a report titled ''New Order, Same Abuses; Unlawful Detentions and Torture in Iraq'' that up to 30,000 prisoners, including many veterans of the U.S. detention system, remain detained without rights in Iraq and are frequently tortured or abused. Furthermore, it describes a detention system that has not evolved since Saddam Hussein's regime, in which human rights abuses were endemic with arbitrary arrests and secret detention common and a lack of accountability throughout the military forces. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Malcolm Smart went on to say: "Iraq's security forces have been responsible for systematically violating detainees' rights and they have been permitted. U.S. authorities, whose own record on detainees' rights has been so poor, have now handed over thousands of people detained by U.S. forces to face this catalogue of illegality, violence and abuse, abdicating any responsibility for their human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Martin Chulov |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/iraq-prisons-and-probation |title=Abuse and torture rife in Iraqi prisons |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |date=September 23, 2010 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917001303/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/iraq-prisons-and-probation |archivedate=September 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''''Alī [[Patronymic#Arabic|ibn]] Mūsā ar-Riḍā''' ({{lang-ar|علي ابن موسى الرّضا}}), also called '''Abu al-Hasan''', ''Ali al-Reza'' ({{Tooltip|c.|circa}} 29 December 765 – 23 August 818)&lt;ref name="book137"/&gt; or in [[Iran]] ([[Name of Iran|Persia]]) as '''Imam Reza''' ({{lang-fa|{{nq|امام رضا}}}}), was a descendant of the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] and the eighth Shi'ite [[the Twelve Imams|Imam]], after his father [[Musa al-Kadhim]], and before his son [[Muhammad al-Jawad]]. He was an [[Imam]] of knowledge according to the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi (Fiver) Shia]] school and [[Sufi]]s. He lived in a period when [[Abbasid]] caliphs were facing numerous difficulties, the most important of which was Shia revolts. The Caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] sought out a remedy for this problem by appointing Al-Ridha as his successor, through whom he could be involved in worldly affairs. However, according to the Shia view, when Al-Ma'mun saw that the Imam gained even more popularity, he decided to correct his mistake by poisoning him. The Imam was buried at the [[Imam Reza shrine]] in a village in [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], which afterwards gained the name [[Mashhad]], meaning the place of martyrdom.&lt;ref name="chittick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabåatabåa'åi|first1=Muhammad Husayn|title=A Shi'ite Anthology|date=1981|others=Selected and with a Foreword by [[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i]]; Translated with Explanatory Notes by [[William Chittick]]; Under the Direction of and with an Introduction by [[Hossein Nasr]] |publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780585078182|pages=49–50 &amp; 138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

==Birth and family life==
On the eleventh of [[Dhu al-Qi'dah]], 148 AH (29 December 765 CE), a son was born in the house of Imam Musa al-Kadhim (the seventh Imam of [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] Islam) in [[Medina]]. He was named Ali and titled al-Ridha, literally meaning in Arabic, "the contented", since it was believed that [[Allah]] was contented with him. His [[Teknonymy|kunya]] (alternative name) was Abu'l Hasan, since he was the father of al-Hasan; the naming of a father after his son being a common practice in Arab culture. However, in the Shia sources he is commonly called ''Abu'l-Ḥasan al-Ṯānī'' (the second Abu'l Hasan), since his father, [[Musa al-Kadhim]], was also Abu'l Hasan (he was known as ''Abu'l-Ḥasan al-Awwal'', meaning the first Abu'l Hasan).

Disputes exist regarding the number of his offspring and their names. A group of scholars (Sunni) say that they were five sons and one daughter, and that they were: Muhammad al- Qani', al-Hasan, Ja'far, Ibrahim, al-Husayn, and 'Ayesha.

==Designation as Imam==
The eighth Imam had reached the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamate]], after the death of his father, through Divine Command and the decree of his forefathers,&lt;ref name="shiite Islam"/&gt; especially Imam [[Musa al-Kadhim]], who would repeatedly tell his companions that his son Ali would be the Imam after him.&lt;ref name="yaqtin"/&gt; As such, Makhzumi says that one day Musa al-Kadhim summoned and gathered us and entitled him as "his executor and successor."&lt;ref name=Tabasi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tabasi|first1=Mohammad Mohsen|title=Imam Ridha in the narrations of Ahl al-Sunnah|journal=Kowsar Culture|date=2007|issue=72|page=67|url=http://www.hawzah.net/fa/magazine/magart/4180/6178/65375}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the onset, al-Kadhim preferred al-Ridha to the rest of his sons, informing them, "This is your brother ‘Ali b. Musa’, who is the scholar of the Household of Muhammad. Question him about your beliefs and memorize what he says to you, for I heard my father, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] say: ‘The scholar of the Household of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his Household, is in your loins. Would that I met him, for he is the namesake of (Imam [[Ali]]) the Commander of the faithful.' "&lt;ref name="al-Qarashi" /&gt;

Yazid ibn Salit has also related a similar narration from the seventh Imam when he met him on his way to [[Mecca]]: "Ali, whose name is the same as the First and the fourth Imam, is the Imam after me." Said the Imam. However, due to the extreme choking atmosphere and pressure prevailed in the period of Musa al-Kazim, he added, "What I said must remain (restricted) up to you and do not reproduce it to anybody unless you know he is one of our friends and companions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Kulayni Arazi|first1=Sheikh Abu Jafar Muhammad Ibn Yaqub Ibn Isha|title=Al Kafi|url=http://www.ahl-ul-bayt.org/en.php/page,336Book1853P157.html?PHPSESSID=d19790ad7c803dd2a03942b6d0dd572d|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140925034331/http://www.ahl-ul-bayt.org/en.php/page,336Book1853P157.html?PHPSESSID=d19790ad7c803dd2a03942b6d0dd572d|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabarsi|first1=Fazl ibn Hassan|authorlink=Shaykh Tabarsi|title=Elam al-Vora Be-A'lam al-Hoda|volume=Vol. 2|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is narrated from Ali bin Yaqtin, from Imam [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa al-Kazim]] who has said "Ali is the best of my children and I have conferred on him my epithet"&lt;ref name="yaqtin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Tabrizi|first1=Al-Mirza Jawad|title=A Concise Treatise of Authentic Traditions Regarding the Right to Divine Leadership (Imamate) of the Twelve Imams|publisher=The Sun Behind The Clouds Publications|url=http://www.al-islam.org/articles/concise-treatise-authentic-traditions-regarding-right-divine-leadership-imamate-twelve-imams|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wāqedī, even in his youth, Ali al-Ridha would transmit [[Hadith]] from his father and his uncles and gave [[Fatwa]] in the mosque of Medina.&lt;ref name= "madelung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Qurashi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Qurashi|first1=Baqir Shareef|title=The Life of Imam 'Ali al-Hadi, Study and Analysis|publisher=Ansariyan Publications|location=Qum|others=Abdullah al-Shahin|url=http://www.al-islam.org/life-imam-ali-al-hadi-study-and-analysis-baqir-shareef-al-qurashi|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali al-Ridha was not looked upon favorably by [[Harun Rashid|Hārūn Rashīd]]; and the people of [[Medina]] were disallowed from visiting and learning from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shabbar|first1=S.M.R.|title=Story of the Holy Ka'aba|publisher=Muhammadi Trust of Great Britain Category:|url=http://www.al-islam.org/story-of-the-holy-kaaba-and-its-people-shabbar|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Donaldson he was twenty or twenty-five years old when he succeeded his father as Imam in Medina, and it was about eighteen years later, when the Caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] "undertook to ingratiate himself with the numerous Shia parties by designating Ali ar-Ridha as his successor to the Caliphate."&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

==Contemporary political situation==
After the death of [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 809, Harun's two sons [[Fourth Fitna|began fighting]] for control of the Abbasid Empire. One son, [[Al-Amin]], had an [[Arab]] mother and thus had the support of Arabs, while his half-brother [[Al-Ma'mun]] had a [[Persian people|Persian]] mother and the support of Persia.&lt;ref name="Sykes2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sykes|first=Sir Percy|title=A History Of Persia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fADAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2|date=27 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-52597-1|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt; After defeating his brother, al-Ma'mun faced many insurrections from the followers of the Prophet's family in many areas.&lt;ref name="Qurashi"/&gt;

The Shia of al-Ma'mun's era, like the Shia of today, who made a large population of al-Ma'mun's Iran, regarded the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imams]] as their leaders who must be obeyed in all aspects of life, spiritual and terrestrial, as they believed in them as the real caliphs of the Islamic Prophet, [[Muhammad]]. The Abbasids, like the Umayyads before them, realized this as a big threat to their own caliphate, since the Shias saw them as usurpers of al-Ma'mun which was far from the sacred status of their Imams. [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei|Allamah Tabatabaei]] writes in his book [[Shi'ite Islam (book)|Shi'ite Islam]], that in order to quiet the many Shia rebellions around his government, al-Ma'mun summoned Imam al-Ridha to [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] and wanted to offer him the role of Crown Prince to prevent the Shias and relatives of al-Ridha from rebelling against the government, seeing as they would then be fighting their own Imam; secondly, to cause the people to lose their spiritual belief and inner attachment to the Imams, because the Imam would be associated with the corrupt government of al-Ma'mun.&lt;ref name="shia islam"&gt;{{cite book|last = Tabatabaei|first = Sayyid Mohammad Hosayn|authorlink = Allameh Tabatabaei|title = Shi'ite Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Be5DeNM8d1EC&amp;pg=PA258|year = 1975|isbn = 0-87395-390-8| others=Translated by [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr|Sayyid Hossein Nasr]]|publisher=State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, he intended it to fool other Shias into believing that his government was not so bad after all, because al-Ridha would then come into power after Ma'mun. And fourthly, he wanted to keep a close watch over the Imam of the Shias himself, so that nothing could happen without al-Ma'mun's knowledge.

Word spread quickly among al-Ma'mun's circles that al-Ma'mun was not sincere in his offer to make Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha the Crown Prince, and that it was simply a political move. Al-Ma'mun also became paranoid and thought that al-Ridha would see through it as well, and so would his Shias. In order to quiet the doubts of the people, al-Ma'mun first offered al-Ridha the caliphate itself. He wrote a letter to the Abbasids, who were displeased with his decision to entrust al-Ridha the seat of the caliphate, saying:
{{quote|Al-Ma’mun did not pledge allegiance to him (al-Ridha) but discerning of his affair, knowing that none on the face of earth is clearer than him in merit, more manifest than him in chastity, more pious than him in piety, more ascetic than him in renouncing the world, freer than him in soul, more pleasing than him to the special associates and the general populace, and ﬁrmer than him in Divine essence. The pledge of allegiance to him conﬁrms with the good pleasure of the Lord.&lt;ref name="al-Qarashi" /&gt;}}

Al-Ridha, who knew the real reason of this offer, politely refused it&lt;ref name="Dungersi1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dungersi|first=Mohammed Raza|title=A Brief Biography of Imam Ali bin Musa (a.s.): al-Ridha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VU9kAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|year=1996|publisher=Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania|isbn=978-9976-956-94-8|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said:

{{quote|If this caliphate belongs to you, then it is not permissible for you to take off the garment in which Allah has clothed you and to give it to other than you. If the caliphate does not belong to you, then it is not permissible for you to give me that which does not belong to you.&lt;ref name="Qurashi"/&gt;}}

Al-Ma'mun kept trying to make his offer seem sincere and kept re-offering the caliphate, and finally moved on to his real plan to make his Crown Prince be Ali al-Ridha. In the document where he pledges allegiance to Ali al-Ridha, Ma'mun writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;His (al-Ma’mu’n’s) choosing ‘Ali b. Musa’ b. Ja‘far b. Muhammad b. ‘Ali b. al-Husayn b. ‘Ali b. Abu’ Ta’lib was after asking Allah for the best and exerting himself in accomplishing His right toward His servants and His Earth concerning the two houses in general (i.e., the ‘Abba’sid House and the ‘Alawide Family, may Allah increase it in honor). That is because he (al-Ma’mu’n) has seen his (the Imam’s) brilliant excellence, his plain knowledge, his manifest piety, his pure asceticism, his renouncing the world, and his being safe from the people. It has become clear for him that reports, tongues, and words have unanimously agreed upon his candidacy. Besides, he knew of his excellence as a youth and through adolescence, so he has appointed him as his successor after him.&lt;ref name="al-Qarashi2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://maaref-foundation.com/english/index.htm|title=The life of Imām 'Ali Bin Mūsā al-Ridā|last1=al-Qarashi|first1=Bāqir Sharif|others=Translated by Jāsim al-Rasheed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;When Imam al-Ridha also declined this position, al-Ma'mun threatened him saying "Your ancestor Ali was chosen by the second caliph to be in a six member council to elect the third caliph, and ordered to kill any one of the six who didn't comply. If you do not accept the position of Crown Prince in my government, I will follow through on the same threat". al-Ridha said he would accept, under the condition that none of the affairs of government would be his. He would neither appoint anyone, nor dismiss. He would not rule, or pass laws. He would only be Crown Prince in name. al-Ma'mun became happy that al-Ridha had accepted and would stay out of his way in governing, and agreed to the condition.

Al-Ma'mun even changed the black Abbāsid flags to green,&lt;ref name="Khaldūn1958"&gt;{{cite book|last=Khaldūn|first=Ibn|title=The Muqaddimah : an introduction to history ; in three volumes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JB0qceU_jDkC&amp;pg=PA55|year=1958|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-09797-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bobrick2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bobrick|first=Benson|title=The Caliph's Splendor: Islam and the West in the Golden Age of Baghdad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7Exsi_hCuwC&amp;pg=PA205|date=14 August 2012|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-6806-3|pages=205–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional color of Shia&lt;ref name="Bobrick2012" /&gt; [[Muhammad|Mohammad]]'s flag and [[Ali]]'s cloak.&lt;ref name="Esposito1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Esposito|first=John L.|title=The Oxford History of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9HUDXkJIE3EC&amp;pg=PA259|date=27 December 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-988041-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also ordered to mint coins with names of both Al-Ma'mun and Ali al-Ridha.&lt;ref name="Bobrick2012" /&gt;

One day, however, when Ali al-Ridha was delivering a speech in a grand assembly, he heard Zayd praising himself before the people, saying I am so and so. Ali al-Ridha asked him saying:&lt;ref name="Oyun"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Saduq|first1=Al-Shaykh|authorlink=Ibn Babawayh|title=UYUN AKHBAR AL-REZA The Source of Traditions on Imam Reza (a.s.)

{{quote|O Zayd, have you trusted upon the words of the grocers of Kufa and are conveying them to the people? What kind of things are you talking about? The sons of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[Fatimah Zahra]] are worthy and outstanding only when they obey the command of Allah, and keep themselves away from sin and blunder. You think you are like [[Musa al-Kadhim]], [[Ali ibn Husayn]], and other [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imams]]? Whereas, they took pains and bore hardships on the way to Allah and prayed to Allah day and night. Do you think you will gain without pain? Be aware, that if a person out of us the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] performs a good deed, he gets twice the reward. Because not only he performed good deeds like others but also that he has maintained the honor of Muhammad. If he practices something bad and does a sin, he has performed two sins. One is that he performed a bad act like the rest of the people and the other one is that he has negated the honor of Muhammad. O brother! The one who obeys Allah is from us the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] and the one who is a sinner is not ours. Allah said about the son of [[Noah]] who cut the spiritual bondage with his father, "He is not out of your lineage; if he was out of your lineage, I would have (saved) and granted him salvation."&lt;ref name="Oyun"/&gt;}}

==Debates==
[[Al-Ma'mun]] was very interested in working on various sciences translated into Arabic. Thus he arranged debates between the Imam and Muslim scholars and the leaders of religion sects who came in his presence.&lt;ref name= "madelung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiite Islam"/&gt;
One of the discussions was on Divine Unity with Sulaiman al-Mervi; a scholar from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], another discussion with Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Jahm was devoted to the sinlessness of the Prophets, which led to another debate on the same subject which Ma'mun took a great part in it himself. Many of these debates are recorded in the collections of [[Shia]] [[hadith]]s, like [[Oyoun Akhbar Al-Ridha]]. The following is an example of these debates which took place between the Imam and an unbeliever([[Zindīq]]).&lt;ref name="chittick"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "madelung"/&gt;

(The Imam) said to him (Zindīq), "Dost thou see that if the correct view is your view then are we not equal? All that we have prayed, fasted, given of the alms and declared of our convictions will not harm us. If the correct view is our view then have not you perished and we gained salvation?"
the Man said. "Then let me know, how is He and where is He?" Abu-l-Hasan(the Imam)answered, "surely the opinion thou hast adopted is mistaken. He determined the 'where', and He was, when there was no 'where'; and He fashioned the 'how', and He was, when there was no 'how'. So He is not known through 'howness' or 'whereness'" The man said, "So then surely He is nothing if He cannot be perceived by any of the senses." Abu-l-Hasan said, "when our senses fail to perceive Him, we know for certain that He is our Lord …" The man said, "Then tell me, when was He?" Abu-l-Hasan said, "Tell when He was not, and then I will tell you when He was..." The man said, "Then why has He veiled Himself (from men)?" Abu-l-Hasan replied, "Surely the veil is upon creatures because of the abundance of their sins. As for Him, no secret is hidden from Him during the day or the night…"

This is a long debate, entitled, ''The Veil'', full text of which could be found in the ''A Shiite Anthology'' translated by [[William Chittick]].&lt;ref name="chittick"/&gt; According to some accounts, Ma'mun's main objective of holding the meetings was a hope to render the Imam incapable of answering questions in order to undermine his popularity. It is related from al-Nawfali who quoted the Imam as saying

&lt;blockquote&gt;Would you (al-Nawfali) like to know when al-Ma'mūn will feel remorseful? ...When he hears me argue with the people of the Torah quoting their own Torah, with the people of the Gospel quoting their own Gospel, with the people of the Psalms quoting their own Psalms, with the Zoroastrians arguing in their Persian language, with the Romans in their own Latin... then al-Ma'mūn will realize that he will not achieve what he aspires...&lt;ref name="al-Qarashi"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
Al-Ma'mun thought he would solve the problems of Shia revolts by naming al-Ridha as his successor. After finally being able to persuade al-Rida to accept this position, al-Ma'mun realized his mistake, for Shia began to gain even more popularity. Moreover, Arab party in [[Baghdad]] were furious when they heard that al-Ma'mun not only appointed the imam as his successor, but sent out commands that the [[Abbasid]]'d black flag should be changed to green in honor of the Imam. They were afraid that the empire would be taken from them. They got together, therefore, to depose Ma'mun and give allegiance to [[Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi]], who was the uncle of Ma'mun.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; When Ma'mun heard this, the Imam advised him to solve the problem by dismissing him from his position but he did not heed and decided to return to [[Baghdad]] and assert his rights.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; However, when they reached the town of [[Sarakhs]], his vizier was assassinated, and when they reached [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], al-Ma'mūn poisoned the Imam. Then, Muhammad Taqi imam's son came. Al-Ma'mūn ordered that he be buried next to the tomb of his own father, [[Harun al-Rashid]], and showed extreme sorrow in the funeral ritual and stayed for three days at the place. According to [[Wilferd Madelung|Madelung]] the unexpected death of both the vizier and the successor, "whose presence would have made any reconciliation with the powerful ʿAbbasid opposition in Baghdad virtually impossible, must indeed arouse strong suspicion that Ma'mun had had a hand in the deaths."&lt;ref name= "madelung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="al-Qarashi"/&gt; The more popular record about his death is that he died in 203 AH, at the age of 50. The precise day is not agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = منتهی الامال|last = قمی|first = شیخ عباس|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 1723|volume = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ritual of reciting the sermon===
The traditional ''Kutbeh Khani'' (Sermon reciting) ritual is held on the night of killing of Imam Reza every year. The ritual, based on the order of governor Ali Shah of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] in 1160 AH, involves the shrine's servants walking from the nearest street around the shrine to Inqilab yard with candles in their hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=Traditional Sermon Reading of Imam Reza (A.S.)

===In the Gregorian calendar===
While the ''Khutbeh-khani'' (Sermon reciting) on the night of the martyrdom of Ali al-Ridha is always on nearly the same day (30[[Safar]]) of the Islamic calendar, the date on the [[Gregorian calendar]] varies from year to year because of differences between the two calendars, since the Islamic calendar, the Hijri calendar (AH), is a [[lunar calendar]] and the Gregorian calendar is a [[solar calendar]].

== Narrations of his Character ==
[[Al-Dhahabi]], known for his enmity towards the [[Ahl al-Bayt]], could not help but acknowledge al-Ridha's merits, saying "He (al-Ridha’) is Imam Abu’ al-Hasan. He was the master of the [[Hashemites]] of his time; he was the most clement and noblest of them. Al Ma’mu’n honored him, yielded to him, and magniﬁed him to the extent that he appointed him as his successor."&lt;ref name="al-Qarashi2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13547">A school bus crash occurring on September 21, 1989 in [[Alton, Texas]], in the [[Rio Grande Valley]] region, resulted in the deaths of 21 junior and senior high school students by drowning or causes related to being asphyxiated. A bottling truck collided with the school bus, causing the latter to enter a [[caliche]] pit filled with water. The driver of the truck was acquitted of negligent homicide charges. The payoffs from lawsuits compensating for the deaths of the students caused division in the Alton community. A middle school that was built in Alton was named in honor of the deceased.

According to the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS), the Alton crash was the sole school bus accident in the United States in the period 1979-1989 in which passengers died due to submersion-related causes.&lt;ref&gt;NTSB Report, p. 35 (PDF p. 42/95).&lt;/ref&gt; {{Asof|2010}} it was the deadliest school bus accident that had ever occurred in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hga02|title=ALTON, TX (HILDAGO COUNTY) (HIDALGO COUNTY) |publisher=[[Handbook of Texas]]|accessdate=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bus filled with water within 30 to 60 seconds,&lt;ref name=NTSBp42&gt;NTSB report, p. 42 (PDF p. 49/95).&lt;/ref&gt; resulting from openings in side windows, the front boarding door, and the windshield which had become dislodged. The students did not have an [[air pocket]] which would have given them time to determine how to escape.&lt;ref name=NTSBp41&gt;NTSB report, p. 41 (PDF p. 48/95).&lt;/ref&gt; None of the passengers experienced trauma-related injuries which would have prevented them from exiting the bus.&lt;ref&gt;NTSB report, p. 38 (PDF p. 45/95).&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the deceased students were away from the exits, in the bus's center. The lack of visibility in the caliche-filled water prevented students from seeing available exits.&lt;ref name=NTSBp41/&gt; In addition, some students became trapped in the windows because of their large sizes, and multiple students attempted the same routes of egress at the same time. The NTSB named the small sizes of the exits as factors inhibiting escape. According to the NTSB, the available time was "inadequate time for 81 desperate students to escape through the available window openings and the rear emergency door that did not remain open before they were trapped underwater."&lt;ref name=NTSBp42/&gt; 

Agents from the [[U.S. Border Patrol]] and 125 emergency vehicles from various agencies assisted in the rescue.&lt;ref name=Fischler/&gt;

Blue Bird Body Company (now [[Blue Bird Corporation]]) also paid a total of $23 million in settlements. The lawyers for the plaintiffs of the lawsuits received about $50 million.&lt;ref name=LemieuxLA/&gt; About 30 brothers and sisters of deceased victims received trust funds ranging in size from $50,000 to $250,000, while parents received the remainder of, and the bulk of, the settlements for victims' relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-26/news/mn-190_1_bus-death|title=NATION IN BRIEF : TEXAS : $72 Million Settles 16 Bus Death Suits|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=1990-05-26|accessdate=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some community residents criticized some of the victims' families as they used the settlement money to make large automobile or house purchases, and some community members expected those receiving settlements to lend money to them; this caused estrangement between the recipients of the settlements and other community members.&lt;ref name=LemieuxLA/&gt;

In May 1990 a guardrail system  along FM 676 at the accident site was installed by the [[Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation]], as the City of Alton had requested. Other guardrails were installed around area caliche pits.&lt;ref name=NTSBp48/&gt;

The 1991 novel ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (novel)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'' received inspiration from the Alton bus crash; it was adapted into the 1997 film ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pulver, Andrew|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/may/14/adaptationoftheweek.books|title=Grim fairytale Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter (1997) |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2005-05-14|accessdate=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alton Memorial Junior High School in Alton was named in honor of the victims.&lt;ref name=Fischler/&gt; On September 21, 2003 the school had its dedication ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://amjhs.mcisd.net/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=216926&amp;type=d&amp;pREC_ID=477888 History]." Alton Memorial Junior High School. Retrieved on August 2, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 a park developed by the city of Alton as a memorial opened; it was funded by a [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] (TPWD) grant.&lt;ref name=CBS4Phots&gt;{{cite web|author=De Leon, Jose III|url=https://valleycentral.com/news/local/archive-photos-alton-bus-wreck|title=Archive Photos: Alton Bus Wreck|publisher=CBS 4|date=2009-09-21|accessdate=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Josefa Garcia Park has a memorial with 21 crosses, one per deceased victim, and a statue of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.progresstimes.net/news/local-news/10775-alton-receives-funding-for-1-5m-park-expansion.html|title=Alton receives funding for $1.5M park expansion|publisher=''[[Progress Times]]''|date=2018-04-06|accessdate=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial is at the intersection of Bryan Road and Mile 5 Line.&lt;ref name=Estadaanniv&gt;{{cite web|author=Estada, Priscilla|url=https://valleycentral.com/news/local/first-responders-survivor-reflect-on-28th-anniversary-of-alton-bus-crash|title=First responders, survivor reflect on 28th anniversary of Alton bus crash|publisher=[[KGBT-TV|KGBT]] (Valley Central CBS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city government of [[Alamo, Texas|Alamo]] has possession of a boat that was a part of the rescue operations; it was making arrangements to place this boat in a museum.&lt;ref name=Estadaanniv/&gt;

This article describes organizations that promote [[Artificial life]].

==International Society of Artificial Life==
'''ISAL''' is a "democratic, international, professional society dedicated to promoting scientific research and education relating to artificial life, including sponsoring conferences, publishing scientific journals and newsletters, and maintaining web sites related to artificial life",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alife.org/mission.html Artificial Life - Governance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227045021/http://www.alife.org/mission.html |date=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; originally incorporated in 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://alife.org/sites/default/files/ISAL-articles-010509.pdf ISAL ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its formation, ISAL has taken over organizing professional conferences on artificial life, alternating each year between the ''International Conference on Artificial Life'' in even years and the ''European Conference on Artificial Life'' in odd years. Each conference is uniquely identified with a Roman numeral.

The current president of ISAL is [[Charles Ofria]] from Michigan State University.  From 2001-2015, the president of ISAL was [[Mark Bedau]].  The ISAL board of directors currently contains 9 elected members and 5 appointed members to carry out specific roles.&lt;ref&gt;http://alife.org/board-members ISAL board members&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISAL also publishes the preeminent artificial life scholarly journal ''[[Artificial Life (journal)|Artificial Life]]'' through [[MIT Press]].

==Biota.org==
'''Biota.org''' is run by [[Tom Barbalet]], and "promotes and assists the engineering of complete, biologically-inspired, synthetic ecosystems and organisms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biota.org/about/ Biota.org: About&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Biota.org ran an annual Digital Biota Conference Series from 1996 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biota.org/ Biota.org: The Artificial Life Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Biota.org has hosted a "collection of interviews, conference lectures and conversations with artificial life developers, academics and users" through a podcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biota.org/podcast/ Biota.org: Podcast&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grey Thumb Society==
The '''Grey Thumb Society''' was a group of "scientists, engineers, hackers, artists, and hobbyists... with a strong interest in artificial life, artificial intelligence, biology, complex systems, and other related topics". Grey Thumb societies appeared around the world but by 2011 most of the groups' activities had wound down.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6320">'''Marcia Annia Claudia Alcia Athenais Gavidia Latiaria''',&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-grc-gre|Μαρκία Κλαυδία Άλκία Άθηναΐς Γαβιδία Λατιαρία}}) otherwise most commonly known as '''Athenais''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Αθηναΐς}})&lt;ref&gt;Graindor, ''Un milliardaire antique'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; (143-161&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Roman noblewoman of [[Greeks|Greek Athenian]] and [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italian Roman]] descent who lived in the [[Roman Empire]].

==Ancestry and Family==
Athenais was born to a distinguished and very rich family of consular rank.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece'' p.p. 349-350&lt;/ref&gt; She was the second daughter and among the children of the Greek Athenian [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]], [[Sophism|Sophist]] [[Herodes Atticus|Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes or Herodes Atticus]] and the Roman highly aristocratic, influential noblewoman [[Aspasia Annia Regilla]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The paternal grandparents of Athenais were the Roman Senator [[Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes (suffect consul 132)|Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes]] and the wealthy heiress [[Vibullia Alcia Agrippina]],&lt;ref&gt;Graindor, ''Un milliardaire antique'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt; while her maternal grandparents were the Roman Senator, Consul [[Appius Annius Trebonius Gallus (consul 139)|Appius Annius Trebonius Gallus]] and the aristocratic woman [[Atilia Caucidia Tertulla]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt; Her paternal uncle was Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodianus, while her paternal aunt was [[Claudia Tisamenis]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt; The maternal uncle of Athenais was [[Appius Annius Atilius Bradua]] who served as an ordinary consul in 160.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Appius Annius Atilius Bradua]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Through her maternal grandfather, Athenais was a relative to the Roman Empress [[Faustina the Elder]], wife of the Roman Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity'' p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faustina the Elder]] was the mother of Roman Empress [[Faustina the Younger]] and aunt of Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity'' p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Thus she was a relative to the family of Faustina the Younger and Marcus Aurelius.

==Life==
Athenais was born in the year of her father’s consulship in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Burn, ''The Penguin History of Greece'' p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; She was probably born in the villa that was owned by her parents on the [[Appian Way]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Aspasia Annia Regilla]]&lt;/ref&gt; After her father’s consulship, Athenais and her family left Italy and moved to [[Greece]]. Athenais was directly cut off from her immediate family and relatives in [[Italy]]. She and her family became a part of the highest Greek circle of society, particularly in [[Athens]]. 

The parents of Athenais erected a great outdoor [[nymphaeum]] (a monumental fountain) at [[Olympia, Greece]]. The monumental fountain features statues and honors members of the ruling imperial family, including members of her family and relatives of her parents. Among the statues was a bust of Athenais which is on display at the [[Archaeological Museum of Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/women_civicdonors.html |title=Plancia Magna, Aurelia Paulina, and Regilla: Civic Donors |publisher=Vroma.org |date= |first=Barbara F. |last=McManus |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The parents of Athenais had betrothed her to an Athenian aristocrat called [[Lucius Vibullius Rufus (son-in-law of Herodes Atticus)|Lucius Vibullius Rufus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity'' p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius Vibullius Rufus and Athenais were paternal second cousins.&lt;ref&gt;Graindor, ''Un milliardaire antique'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity'' p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius Vibullius Rufus was previously married and had at least one son called Lucius Vibullius.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity'' p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius Vibullius was adopted by Herodes Atticus as his son sometime after 160 and was known as ''Lucius Vibullius Claudius Herodes''.&lt;ref&gt;Graindor, ''Un milliardaire antique'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity'' p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

In 160 Athenais married Lucius Vibullius Rufus. In 161, Athenais bore a son called [[Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus (grandson of Herodes Atticus)|Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity'' p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the birth of their son, Athenais died.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, ''The murder of Regilla: a case of domestic violence in antiquity'' p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Biocybernetics''' is the application of [[cybernetics]] to [[biological science]], composed of biological disciplines that benefit from the application of cybernetics including [[neurology]] and multicellular systems. Biocybernetics plays a major role in [[systems biology]], seeking to integrate different levels of information to understand how biological systems function.

Biocybernetics is an abstract science and is a fundamental part of [[theoretical biology]], based upon the principles of [[systemics]].

== Terminology ==
Biocybernetics is a conjoined word from bio (Greek: βίο / life) and [[cybernetics]] (Greek: κυβερνητική / controlling-governing). Although the extended form of the word is biological cybernetics, the field is most commonly referred to as biocybernetics in scientific papers. Bioinformatics may also be properly referred to as bio informatics.

== Early proponents ==
Early proponents of biocybernetics include Ross Ashby, Hans Drischel, and Norbert Wiener among others. Popular papers published by each scientist are listed below.

[[W. Ross Ashby|Ross Ashby, "Introduction to Cybernetics", 1956]]&lt;ref&gt;[[W. Ross Ashby]], ''Introduction to Cybernetics''. Methuen, London, UK, 1956.  [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/IntroCyb.pdf PDF text].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[:de:Hans Drischel|Hans Drischel, "Einführung in die Biokybernetik." 1972]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Hans Drischel|Hans Drischel]], ''Einführung in die Biokybernetik.'' Berlin 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[Norbert Wiener|Norbert Wiener, "Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine", 1948]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Norbert Wiener]], ''Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'', (Hermann &amp; Cie Editeurs, Paris, The Technology Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York, 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar fields ==
Papers and research that delve into topics involving biocybernetics may be found under a multitude of similar names, including molecular cybernetics, neurocybernetics, and cellular cybernetics. Such fields involve disciplines that specify certain aspects of the study of the living organism (for example, neurocybernetics focuses on the study neurological models in organisms).

== Categories ==
* Biocybernetics – the study of an entire living organism
* [[Neurocybernetics]] – cybernetics dealing with neurological models. (''[[Psycho-Cybernetics]]'' was the title of a self-help book, and is not a scientific discipline)
* Molecular cybernetics – cybernetics dealing with molecular systems (e.g. molecular biology cybernetics)
* Cellular cybernetics – cybernetics dealing with cellular systems (e.g. information technology/cell phones or biological cells)
* Evolutionary cybernetics – study of the evolution of informational systems (See also [[evolutionary programming]], [[evolutionary algorithm]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9773">'''Breastfeeding and medications''' is the description of the [[medication]]s that can be used by a [[breastfeeding]] mother with no or few consequences and those medications which are recommended to be avoided. Some medications are excreted in [[breastmilk]].&lt;ref name = leche&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/lv/lvaprmay97p39.html|title=The La Leche League InternationalI - Medications and Breastfeeding|publisher = La leche League International |accessdate = 2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2001/0701/p119.html|title=Medications in the Breast-Feeding Mother|first1=Jeanne P.|last1=Spencer|first2=Luis S. Gonzalez|last2=III|first3=Donna|last3=Barnhart|date=1 July 2001|publisher=|journal=American Family Physician|volume=64|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all medicines pass into breastmilk in small amounts. Some have no effect on the baby and can be used while breastfeeding.&lt;ref name = NIH2014&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.womenshealth.gov/files/assets/docs/breastfeeding/owh_fs_breastfeeding_7-25-2014.pdf | publisher =  Office on Women’s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services| date = 2014 | accessdate = 20 July 2017 | title = Breastfeeding}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The National Institutes of Medicine]] (US) maintains a [[database]] containing information on drugs and other [[chemicals]] to which breastfeeding mothers may be exposed. It includes information on the levels of such substances in breast milk and infant blood, and the possible [[adverse effect]]s in the nursing infant. Suggested therapeutic alternatives to those drugs are provided, where appropriate. All data are derived from reliable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/lactmed.htm|title=Drugs and Lactation Database (LactMed)|website=toxnet.nlm.nih.gov}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medications and herbal supplements can be of concern. This can be because the drug can accumulate in breastmilk or have effects on the infant and the mother. Those medications of concern are those medications used to treat substance and alcohol addiction. Other medications of concern are those that are used in smoking cessation. Pain medications and antidepressants need evaluation.&lt;ref name = aap&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/Pages/Breastfeeding-and-Medication.aspx|title=Breastfeeding and Medication| publisher = American Association of Pediatrics|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Evaluating the potential for adverse effects==
The determination of the safety of a medication can be evaluated by considering the following:
*If and how much of the drug is present in breastmilk.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*The age and maturity of the infant. [[Full term]] infants are better able to [[metabolize]] medications than [[premature infant]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}
*The weight of the infant.
*The amount and percentage of breastmilk consumed by the infant. An infant taking solid foods with breastfeeding will receive a lower dose of medication.
*The general health of the infant and the general health of the mother.
*The nature of the mother's illness, if present.
*The general information about the drug other literature documenting studies related to the drug and breastfeeding.
*The duration of the drug therapy.
*Is the drug short-acting? A short-acting form of the drug may be a better choice for a breastfeeding mother rather than a longer-acting form that stays in the mother's system for a longer period.
*How is the medication being given?

Drugs can be categorised in one of five categories to determine how safe they are for breastfeeding:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medications and Mothers' Milk 2017|last=Hale|first=Thomas Wright|last2=Rowe|first2=Hilary E.|date=2016-12-30|publisher=Springer Publishing Co Inc|isbn=9780826128584|edition=17th|location=New York|language=English|id= {{ASIN|0826128580|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medsmilk.com/pages/reading|title=Medications and Mothers Milk Online|website=www.medsmilk.com|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medref.cmbc.bc.ca/drug-standards/lactation-drug-risk-categories/|title=Lactation Drug Risk Categories|last=|first=|date=|work=CMBC Medical Reference|access-date=2018-03-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aiVesab_2bwC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138|title=Breastfeeding and Human Lactation|last=Riordan|first=Jan|date=2005|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|year=|isbn=9780763745851|location=|pages=138|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== L1 Compatible ===

"Drug which has been taken by a large number of breastfeeding mothers without any observed increase in adverse effects in the infant. Controlled studies in breastfeeding women fail to demonstrate a risk to the infant and the possibility of harm to the breastfeeding infant is remote; or the product is not orally bioavailable in an infant."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== L2 Probably Compatible ===

"Drug which has been studied in a limited number of breastfeeding women without an increase in adverse effects in the infant. And/or, the evidence of a demonstrated risk which is likely to follow use of this medication in a breastfeeding woman is remote."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== L3 Probably Compatible ===

"There are no controlled studies in breastfeeding women, however the risk of untoward effects to a breastfed infant is possible; or, controlled studies show only minimal non-threatening adverse effects. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant. (New medications that have absolutely no published data are automatically categorized in this category, regardless of how safe they may be.)"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== L4 Possibly Hazardous ===

"There is positive evidence of risk to a breastfed infant or to breastmilk production, but the benefits of use in breastfeeding mothers may be acceptable despite the risk to the infant (e.g. if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective)."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== L5 Hazardous ===

"Studies in breastfeeding mothers have demonstrated that there is significant and documented risk to the infant based on human experience, or it is a medication that has a high risk of causing significant damage to an infant. The risk of using the drug in breastfeeding women clearly outweighs any possible benefit from breastfeeding. The drug is contraindicated in women who are breastfeeding an infant."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Over the counter medications==
[[Over the counter medications]] are those medications that do not require a [[prescription drug|prescription]] to purchase in the US. Medications that require a prescription to purchase in the US may be available in other countries without a prescription. The following guidelines are recommended:

* taking oral medications after breastfeeding rather than before will allow some of the medication to leave the mother's body through her kidneys between nursings.
* in most women without kidney disease, [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s and [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) are used safely.
* [[aspirin]] can cause rashes and even cause bleeding in infants.
* limit the use of antihistamines for long periods of time. These anti-allergy medications can cause crying, sleep problems, fussiness, excessive sleepiness in babies. Antihistamines have an effect on the amount of milk the body produces and decrease the supply.
* carefully observe the infant for changes or side effects when first taking a medication to watch for side effects. Side effects indicating that the medication is having an affect on the baby is difficulty breathing, rash and other questionable changes that occurred after the medication was started by the mother.
* many times other young children are in the home and keeping these over the counter medications out of their reach is a safe practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familydoctor.org/otc-medicines-and-pregnancy/|title=OTC Medicines and Pregnancy - familydoctor.org|first=familydoctor.org editorial|last=staff|date=1 September 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other substances or chemicals have been evaluated regarding their safe use during pregnancy. Hair dye or solutions used for a 'permanent' do not pass to breastmilk. No adverse reports of using oral antihistamines and breastfeeding are found. Some of the older antihistamines used by a nursing mother can cause drowsiness in the infant. This may be a concern if the infant misses feedings by sleeping instead of nursing.&lt;ref name = uk&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk/detailed-information/drugs-in-breastmilk/drugs-faqs/|title= Drugs in Breastmilk -Is It Safe?|publisher= The Breasfeeding Network - Britains Nonprofit Breastfeeding Support Organization|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bryan Foy''' (December 8, 1896 &amp;ndash; April 20, 1977) was an American [[film producer]] and [[film director|director]]. He produced 214 films between 1924 and 1963. He also directed 41 films between 1923 and 1934.  He headed the [[B picture]] unit at [[Warner Bros.]] where he was known as "the keeper of the B's".&lt;ref&gt;p. 430 Senn, Bryan ''Golden Horrors'' 1996 McFarland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], on December 8, 1896. He was the eldest son of the vaudeville star [[Eddie Foy, Sr.|Eddie Foy]] and appeared with his father in the [[vaudeville]] act "Eddie Foy and The Seven Little Foys." The act broke up when Bryan Foy left to join the U.S. Army in World War I in 1918,&lt;ref name=Travel&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travsd.wordpress.com/2010/03/09/stars-of-vaudeville-130-eddie-foy-the-seven-little-foys-and-the-youngest-foy-of-all/ |publisher=Travalanche |title=Stars of Vaudeville #130: Eddie Foy, the Seven Little Foys, and the Youngest Foy of All |accessdate=December 29, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6e9RjISoH?url=https://travsd.wordpress.com/2010/03/09/stars-of-vaudeville-130-eddie-foy-the-seven-little-foys-and-the-youngest-foy-of-all/ |archivedate=December 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; after which his remaining siblings continued performing with their father under the title, "Eddie Foy and the Younger Foys", through 1923, when their father retired.&lt;ref name=EFBio&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h4uHH5Kz1DAC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;q=The%20Seven%20Little%20Foys%20vaudeville | title=Eddie Foy: A Biography | last=Fields | first=Armond | pages=243–44 | year=1999 | publisher=McFarland | isbn=0786443286 | accessdate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23904">'''Corpse roads''' provided a practical means for transporting corpses, often from remote communities, to [[cemetery|cemeteries]] that had burial rights, such as parish churches and [[chapel of ease|chapels of ease]].&lt;ref name="Muir"&gt;{{cite book|author=Muir, Richard |date=2008|title= Woods, Hedgerows and Leafy Lanes|publisher= Tempus|location= Chalford|isbn=978-0-7524-4615-8|page= 163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, such routes can also be known by a number of other names, e.g.: '''bier road''', '''burial road''', '''coffin line''', '''coffin road''', '''corpse way''', '''funeral road''', '''lych way''', '''lyke way''', or '''procession way'''.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt; etc. Such "church-ways" have developed a great deal of associated [[folklore]] regarding [[ghost]]s, spirits, [[ghost#Terminology|wraith]]s, etc.
[[File:Old Corpse Road - geograph.org.uk - 72907.jpg|thumb|Corpse road in the Lake District]]
[[File:Coffin Stone at Town End - geograph.org.uk - 1767270.jpg|thumb|A coffin stone at Town End, in the Lake District]]

==Origins==
[[File:Lych gate.jpg|thumb|A traditional English [[lychgate]].]]
In late [[medieval]] times a population increase and an expansion of church building took place in Great Britain inevitably encroaching on the territories of existing mother churches or [[minster (cathedral)|minsters]]. Demands for autonomy from outlying settlements made minster officials feel that their authority was waning, as were their revenues, so they instituted corpse roads connecting outlying locations and their mother churches (at the heart of parishes) that alone held burial rights. For some parishioners, this decision meant that corpses had to be transported long distances, sometimes through difficult terrain: usually a corpse had to be carried unless the departed was a wealthy individual. An example would be the funeral way that runs from [[Rydal, Cumbria|Rydal]] to [[Ambleside]] in the Lake District where a [[Coffin Stone|coffin stone]] (''illustrated above right''), on which the coffin was placed while the parishioners rested, still exists.&lt;ref name="Image"&gt;[http://www.pbase.com/koster10/image/64323238 The Rydal Coffin stone]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the 'new' churches were eventually granted burial rights and corpse roads ceased to be used as such.

==Church-way paths==
[[File:St Michael's Church, Tidcombe, Wiltshire, England.jpg|thumb|An old church and cemetery in Wiltshire]]
Many of the corpse roads have long disappeared, while the original purposes of those that still survive as [[footpath]]s have been largely forgotten, especially if features such as coffin stones or crosses no longer exist. Fields crossed by church-way paths often had names like "Church-way" or "Kirk-way Field", and today it is sometimes possible to plot the course of some lost church-ways by the sequence of old field names, local knowledge of churches, local legends and lost features of the landscape marked on old maps, etc. One of the oldest superstitions is that any land over which a corpse is carried becomes a public right of way.&lt;ref name="Waring"&gt;Waring, Philippa (1978). ''The Dictionary of Superstitions''. Treasure Press. {{ISBN|1-85051-009-1}}. P. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a corpse road or way is that of the church of St Peter and Paul at [[Blockley]], in [[Gloucestershire]], which held the burial right to the inhabitants of the hamlets [[Stretton-on-Fosse]] in [[Warwickshire]], where there was a chapel which became a rectory in the 12th century, and [[Aston Magna]], where there was a chapel which was merely a chantry. All 'tithes' and 'mortuaries', however, came to the parish church of Blockley, to which church the people of Stretton and Aston were committed to carry their deceased for burial. The corpse road from Aston to Blockley churchyard is over two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long and crosses three small streams en route. The corpse road from Stretton to Blockley runs for some four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) and crosses two streams.&lt;ref name="Leyhunter"&gt;[http://www.leyhunter.com/archives/new17.htm Corpse roads in Gloucestershire.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of corpse roads==

===The spirits of the dead===
The essence of deep-rooted spirit lore is that supposed spirits of one kind or another – spirits of the dead, phantasms of the living, wraiths, or nature entities like [[fairy path|fairies]] move through the physical landscape along special routes. In their ideal, pristine form, at least, such routes are conceived of as being straight, having something in common with [[ley line]]s. By the same token, convoluted or non-linear features hinder spirit movement i.e. [[labyrinth]]s and [[maze]]s.

[[File:Schönbusch4.jpg|thumb|Hedge maze in the "English Garden" at Schönbusch Park, [[Aschaffenburg]], Germany.]]
Spirits or ghosts were said to fly along on a direct course close to the ground, so a straight line connecting two places was kept clear of fences, walls, and buildings to avoid obstructing the flitting spectres.&lt;ref&gt;Similar traditions of spirits only moving in straight lines exist elsewhere – the [[aling-aling]] found in [[Bali]] are a wall directly inside a door, which keep spirits ([[hyang]]) out because they only move in straight lines. See [http://www.bali-travel-life.com/bali-religion.html Bali Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704121228/http://www.bali-travel-life.com/bali-religion.html |date=2010-07-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The paths would run in a straight line over mountains and valleys and through marshes. In towns, they would pass the houses closely or go right through them. The paths end or originate at a cemetery; therefore, such a path or road was believed to have the same characteristics as a cemetery, where spirits of the deceased thrive.

The corpse roads or ways were left unploughed and it was considered very bad luck if for any reason a different route had to be taken.&lt;ref name="Rees-Mogg146"&gt;[http://www.leyhunter.com/archives/new4.htm Ley Hunters and Corpse Roads.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corpse candles and other related phenomena===
{{anchor|Corpse candle}}
A corpse candle or light is a flame or ball of light, often blue, that is seen to travel just above the ground on the route from the cemetery to the dying person's house and back again, and is particularly associated with Wales.&lt;ref name="Pennick1996145"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; A corpse fire is very similar as the name comes from lights appearing specifically within graveyards where it was believed the lights were an omen of death or coming tragedy and would mark the route of a future funeral, from the victim's house to the graveyard, where it would vanish into the ground at the site of the burial. The appearance was often said to be on the night before a death.&lt;ref name="Roud"&gt;Roud, Steven (2003) ''The Penguin Guide to the Superstitions of Britain and Ireland.'' Penguin Books. London. P. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Armillaria mellea 041031w.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''[[Armillaria mellea]]'', [[list of bioluminescent fungi|bioluminescent fungus]]]]
Among European rural people, especially in [[Goidelic|Gaelic]], [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[folklore]], the [[will-o'-the-wisp]]s are held to be mischievous [[spiritual being|spirit]]s of the [[death|dead]] or other [[supernatural]] beings attempting to lead travellers astray&lt;ref&gt;[http://inamidst.com/lights/wisp/ Will-o'-the-Wisp - The Lantern Man, Feu Follet, Ignis Fatuus]&lt;/ref&gt; (compare [[Puck (mythology)|Puck]]). Sometimes they are believed to be the spirits of unbaptized or stillborn children, flitting between [[heaven]] and [[hell]]. Other names are Jack O' Lantern, or Joan of the Wad, Jenny Burn-tail, Kitty wi' the Whisp, or Spunkie.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Clarke, D. (1990). ''Lights in the sky.'' Country Life Magazine 19 April: 188 - 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anybody seeing this phenomenon might merely have been seeing, without knowing, a luminescent [[barn owl]], at least in some instances. Much anecdotal evidence supports the fact that barn owls have a luminescence which may be due to fungal bioluminescence ([[foxfire]]).&lt;ref name="Owl"&gt;[http://www.owlpages.com/articles.php?section=Studies+and+Papers&amp;title=Min+Min Barn owl luminescence.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible those who have observed corpse candles may have been witnessing the effect of methane gases produced by decomposing organic material found in swamps, marshlands, and bogs.

===''A Midsummer Night's Dream''===
[[File:Study for The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania.jpg|thumb|''The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania'', by [[Joseph Noel Paton]]]]
In Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] says:
{| cellpadding=10 border="0" align=center
|-
| bgcolor=#f4f4f4|
Now it is the time of night,&lt;br&gt;
That the graves all gaping wide,&lt;br&gt;
Every one lets forth his sprite,&lt;br&gt;
In the church-way paths to glide.
|}

Puck suggests a secret history of these routes, for unsurprisingly they attracted long extant folk lore, running not only through the physical countryside but also through the invisible geography, the 'mental terrain', of pre-industrial country-folk. Shakespeare's lines leave little doubt that the physical corpse roads came to be perceived as being spirit routes, taking on qualities which lingered in the folklore of his age and which he incorporated into his play knowing that it would be a familiar concept.

===Spirit roads and archaeological features===
[[File:Glenwaterdarvel.JPG|left|thumb|170px|Spirits could not cross running water such as the Glen Water near [[Darvel]] in Scotland.]]
The spirit roads, such as the church-ways, were always conceived of as being straight, but the physical corpse roads of the United Kingdom vary as much as any other path. Corpses were conveyed along defined corpse roads to avoid their spirits returning to haunt the living. It was a widespread custom, for example, that the feet of the corpse be kept pointing away from the family home on its journey to the cemetery.{{cn|date=November 2014}} [[File:Knocknakilla 25.jpg|thumb|150px|right|&lt;center&gt;View of the megalithic complex at [[Knocknakilla]], with a stone row shown behind a 3.5 m portal stone&lt;center&gt;]] Other minor ritualistic means of preventing the return of the dead person included ensuring that the route the corpse took to burial would take it over bridges or stepping stones across running water which spirits could not cross, stiles, and various other 'liminal' ("betwixt and between") locations, all of which had reputations for preventing or hindering the free passage of spirits. The living took pains to prevent the dead from wandering the land as lost souls or animated corpses, for the belief in [[Medieval revenant|revenant]]s (ghosts) was widespread in mediæval Europe.

People using the corpse roads assumed that they could be passages for ghosts. The ancient spirit folklore that attached itself to the medieval and later corpse roads also may have informed certain prehistoric features. In Britain, for instance, Neolithic earthen avenues called [[cursus]]es link burial mounds: these features can run for considerable distances, even miles, and are largely straight, or straight in segments, connecting funerary sites. The purpose of these avenues is imperfectly understood, but some kind of spirit-way function may be one reasonable explanation. Similarly, some Neolithic and Bronze Age graves, especially in France and Britain, are associated with stone rows, like those at [[Merrivale, Devon|Merrivale]] on [[Dartmoor]], with intriguing blocking stones at their ends.&lt;ref name="Fortean"&gt;[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/mapas_ocultotierra/esp_mapa_ocultotierra_13.htm Where the Leylines led]&lt;/ref&gt;

Homer Sykes in ''Mysterious Britain'' says that the 'holed' Cornish [[Tolvan holed stone|'Tolvan' stone]] was used to block a now lost ancient burial chamber, and suggests that the hole allowed a way in for funeral purposes and a passage out for the spirits of the dead.&lt;ref name=sykes&gt;Sykes, Homer (1993). ''Mysterious Britain''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, around 4000–6000 years old, bog causeways constructed from timber have been excavated. The "[[Sweet Track]]" in [[Somerset]], is one of the oldest and the excavations along this old straight track indicated that one of its uses was for transporting the dead.&lt;ref name="L"&gt;[http://www.pauldevereux.co.uk/new/html/body_leylines.html Ley Lines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909090653/http://www.pauldevereux.co.uk/new/html/body_leylines.html |date=September 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated legends and beliefs==
Some country-folk claim that if a dead body is carried across a field it will thereafter fail to produce good crop yields.&lt;ref name="Waring"/&gt; Throughout the United Kingdom and Europe it still believed that touching a corpse in the coffin will allow the departed spirit to go in peace to its rest, and bring good luck to the living.&lt;ref name="Waring67"&gt;Waring, Philippa (1978). ''The Dictionary of Superstitions''. Treasure Press. {{ISBN|1-85051-009-1}}. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LochLevenFromKinross.jpg|thumb|View east across Loch Leven from Kinross]]
Phantom lights are sometimes seen on the Scottish cemetery-island of Mun in [[Loch Leven (Kinross)|Loch Leven]] and traditionally such lights were thought to be omens of impending death; the soul also was thought to depart the body in the form of a flame or light.&lt;ref name="Pennick1996145"/&gt;

In Ireland, the ''féar gortach'' ("hungry grass"/"violent hunger") is said to grow at a place where an unenclosed corpse was laid on its way to burial. This is thought to be a permanent effect and anyone who stands on such grass is said to develop insatiable hunger. One such place is in [[Ballinamore]] and was so notorious that the woman of the nearby house kept a supply of food on hand for victims.&lt;ref name="Pennick1996134"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Aran Islands|Aranmore Island]] off Ireland each passing funeral would stop and erect a memorial pile of stones on the smooth rocky surface on the roadside enclosure.&lt;ref name="Wentz40"&gt;Evans-Wentz, W. Y. (1911). ''The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries.'' Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). {{ISBN|0-901072-51-6}}. pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of specific coffin stones, crosses or [[lychgate]]s on church-ways, suggests that these may have been specially positioned and sanctified so as to allow the coffin to be placed there temporarily without the chance of the ground becoming in some way tainted or the spirit given an opportunity to escape and haunt its place of death.&lt;ref name="Coffinstone"/&gt;
[[File:StDavidsCathedral.jpg|right|thumb|[[St David's Cathedral]] from the gatehouse]]
[[Giraldus Cambrensis|Gerald of Wales]] (Giraldus Cambrensis) in the 13th-century relates the strange story of a marble footbridge leading from the church over the Alan [[rivulet]] in [[Saint David]]s. The marble stone was called 'Llechllafar' (the talking stone) because it once spoke when a corpse was carried over it to the cemetery for interment. The effort of speech had caused it to break, despite its size of ten feet in length, six in breadth and one in thickness. This bridge was worn smooth due to its age and the thousands of people who had walked over it, however the superstition was so widely held that corpses were no longer carried over it.&lt;ref name="Hoare"&gt;Hoare, Sir Richard Colt (1806). ''The Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales; MCLXXXVIII by Giraldus de Barri''. London: William Miller. pp. 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This ancient bridge was replaced in the 16th century and its present location is not known.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;Phillips, Rev James (1909). ''The History of Pembrokeshire.'' London: Elliot Stock. pp. 205-206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, William Basil, and Freeman, Edward Augustus (1856). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ECXnAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The History and Antiquities of Saint David's].'' London: Parker, Smith &amp; Petherman. p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legend is that [[Merlin]] had prophesied the death on Llechllafar of an English King, conqueror of Ireland, who had been injured by a man with a red hand. King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] went on pilgrimage to Saint David's after coming from Ireland, heard of the prophecy and crossed Llechllafar without ill effect. He boasted that Merlin was a liar, to which a bystander replied that the King would not conquer Ireland and was therefore not the king of the prophecy.&lt;ref name="Hoare"/&gt; This turned out to be true, for Henry never did conquer the whole of Ireland.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;

A [[Devon]] legend tells of a funeral procession heading across [[Dartmoor]] on its way to [[Widecombe]] and the burial ground, carrying a particularly unpopular and evil old man. They reach the coffin stone and place the coffin on it while they rest. A beam of light strikes the coffin, reducing it and its contents to ashes and splitting the coffin stone. The party believes that God did not wish to have such an evil man buried in a cemetery.&lt;ref name="Coffinstone"&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/coffin_stone.htm] Legends of Dartmoor&lt;/ref&gt;

The villagers in [[Manaton]] in Devon used to carry coffins three times round the churchyard cross, much to the irritation of the vicar, who opposed the superstition. Upon being ignored, he had the cross destroyed.&lt;ref name="Bord115"&gt;Bord, Janet and Colin (1976). ''The Secret Country''. London: Paul Elek. {{ISBN|0-236-40048-7}}. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Lych way' is a track lying to the south-west of Devil's Tor on Dartmoor. The dead from remote moorland homesteads were taken along this track to [[Lydford]] church for burial. Many reports have been made of monks in white and phantom funeral processions seen walking along this path.&lt;ref name="Hippisley Coxe30"&gt;Hippisley Coxe, Anthony E. (1973). ''Haunted Britain''. London: Hutchinson. {{ISBN|0-09-116540-7}}. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Childe's Tomb on Dartmoor is the site of the death of Childe who was caught in a snowstorm, killed and disembowelled his horse and climbed inside for shelter, but still froze to death. He left a message to say that the first person to bury him would get his lands at [[Plymstock]]. The greedy monks of [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]] buried him and claimed the lands. The ghosts of monks carrying a [[bier]] have been seen at Childe's tomb.&lt;ref name="Hippisley Coxe30"/&gt;

An old woman at [[Fryup]] in [[Yorkshire]] was well known locally for keeping the "Mark's e’en watch" (24 April), as she lived alongside a corpse road known as the "Old Hell Road". In this 'watch', typically a village seer would hold a vigil between 11 pm and 1 am on [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]]'s Day, in order to look for the wraiths of those who would die in the following year.&lt;ref name="Fortean"/&gt;

===Crossroads===
Places where tracks intersect are considered dangerous and are believed occupied by special spirit-guardians because they are places of transition where the world and the underworld intersect. The Celtic god [[Lugh]] indicated the right road at such places and was a guide to the traveler's footsteps. The god of the dead was the divinity of the crossroad and later Christian crosses were erected at such places.&lt;ref name="Pennick1996135"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossroads [[divination]] was conducted in Britain and other parts of Europe, and is associated with the belief that the [[Devil]] could be made to manifest at such intersections. Crossroads lore also includes the idea that spirits of the dead could be "bound" (immobilized or rendered powerless) at crossroads, specifically suicides and hanged criminals, but also witches, outlaws and gypsies.&lt;ref name="Pennick1996135"/&gt; The belief was that since straight routes could facilitate the movement of spirits, so contrary features like crossroads and stone or turf [[labyrinth]]s could hinder it. An example of a crossroad execution-ground was the famous [[Tyburn, London]], which stood on the spot where the Roman road to [[Edgware]] crossed the Roman road heading west out of London.&lt;ref name="Fortean"/&gt;

==Excluding the spirits of the dead==
[[File:Witchball2.JPG|150px|thumb|A [[witch ball]] on a Rowan tree in [[Lambroughton]], Ayrshire.]][[File:Cretan-labyrinth-round.svg|left|thumb|150px|A labyrinth.]]
This was part of a broader fear of spirits that might flit into dwellings. [[Witch bottle]]s were common throughout Europe – bottles or glass spheres containing a mass of threads, often with charms entangled in them. Its purpose was to draw in and trap evil and negative energy directed at its owner. Folk magic contends that the witch bottle protects against evil spirits and magical attack, and counteracts spells cast by witches, also forestalling the passage into habitations of witches flying about at night.&lt;ref name="Fortean2"&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/491/where_the_leylines_led.html Where the Ley lines led]&lt;/ref&gt; A witch ball was much the same; however, a more light-hearted belief was that the witch saw her distorted face in the curved glass and was frightened away. The term witch ball is probably a corruption of ''watch ball'' because it was used as a guard against evil spirits.

If straight lines did not hinder the passage of spirits, then convoluted or tangled "lines" could ensnare them and ancient stone and turf labyrinths, found in many parts of Europe and Scandinavia, could serve the purpose of capturing evil spirits.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;

==Corpse paths worldwide==
[[File:Stone Elephant Road - elephants - P1060468.JPG|thumb|right|Stone elephants along the [[spirit way]] of the [[Hongwu Emperor]] at [[Ming Xiaoling]]]]
During several dynasties of the imperial China, the pathway to the burial mound of an emperor or a high dignitary would be lined with the statues of real and fantastic animals and of the civil and military officials, and would be known as the ''shendao'' ([[spirit way]]) At major imperial mausolea, such as [[Ming Xiaoling]] in [[Nanjing]] or the [[Ming Dynasty Tombs]] near [[Beijing]], the spirit way could be several hundreds of meters, sometimes over a kilometer, long.

A straight Viking cult or Corpse road at Rosaring, [[Uppland]], Sweden, was unearthed by archaeologists. The body of the dead Viking chieftains were drawn along it in a ceremonial wagon to the grave site. The Netherlands had the Doodwegen or Spokenwegen, the deathroads or ghostroads, converging on medieval cemeteries, some surviving in straight section fragments to this day.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;

In the Arenal area of [[Costa Rica]], NASA surveys detected straight paths running considerable distances through the mountainous rainforest. Upon closer examination, these routes were found to date from CE 500-1200 and had been constructed as corpse paths, along which bodies were carried to burial.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;

'''Emma Jane Greenland''' (later, '''Emma Jane Greenland Hooker'''; 1760–1843) was an English painter, writer and singer. She was awarded a Gold Pallet on 14 November  1786 by the Society at London for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce.{{sfn|Ostell|1801|p=138}} Greenland may have been a pupil of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], and she owned some of his manuscripts after his death.&lt;ref name="Corneilson2017"/&gt;

==Early years and education==
[[File:Emma Jane Greenland panel.jpg|thumb|"Madonna and child with Saint John and cherub" on a panel by Greenland]]
Emma Jane Greenland was born in [[London]] in 1760. Her father is thought to be Augustus Greenland.&lt;ref name="Corneilson2017"/&gt; In the decade from 1772 to 1782 she studied painting with [[Francesco Bartolozzi]] at the Incorporated Society of Artists in London as well as with [[Giovanni Battista Cipriani]] and Giovan Battista Capezzuoli at the gallery of the [[Duke of Richmond]]. In order to perfect her work, she moved to Italy and in 1783, in [[Rome]], began studying [[encaustic painting]] with [[Joseph Pignatelli]]. In 1785, in [[Florence]], she practiced encaustic painting at the salon of [[Irene Parenti Duclos]] and thanks to her, Hooker began to attend the Royal Gallery.

==Career==
She returned to London in 1786, and in the following year, published ''Curios discovery of the ancient grecian method of painting on wax''. Greenland also exhibited her self-portrait, at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London as an Honorary Exhibitor. 

Her first communication to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce of London, with examples of this mode of painting, was made in the year 1786,&lt;ref name="Elmes1826"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Elmes|title=A General and Bibliographical Dictionary of the Fine Arts: Containing Explanations of the Principal Terms Used in the Arts of Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, and Engraving, in All Their Various Branches; Historical Sketches of the Rise and Progress of Their Different Schools; Descriptive Accounts of the Best Books and Treatises on the Fine Arts; and Every Useful Topic Connected Therewith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKhBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP312|year=1826|publisher=T. Tegg|pages=312–}}&lt;/ref&gt; one example of which was preserved in the Society's rooms at the Adelphi. For her very successful efforts in encaustic painting, Greenland was presented with a gold palette by the Society in 1786. Her account was printed in the 10th volume of the Society's ''Transactions'' for the year 1792. 
In the year 1807, she made a farther communication to the Society of the result of no less than 50 experiments per day, during more than four months.{{sfn|Elmes|1826|p=312}} It was proposed that this methos painting should be called the ''Hookerian'' method.&lt;ref name="Elmes1826"/&gt;
 
From 1801, with her husband, she directed a school for young aristocracy in [[Sussex]], which included the grandchildren of the [[Duke of Wellington (title)|Duke of Wellington]] and [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte as students.{{fact|date=September 2017}} Greenland's music career gave her great satisfaction as when [[Johann Christian Bach]] dedicated to her six sonatas for piano and violin. Her father was a witness to Bach's will and Emma wrote her name on the title page of each document and at the head of each movement. Emma may have been a pupil of Bach's.&lt;ref name="Corneilson2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Corneilson|title=J.C. Bach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTQrDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360|date=5 July 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-56188-4|pages=360–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in London in 1843.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10628">'''Futile medical care''' is the continued provision of medical care or treatment to a patient when there is no reasonable hope of a cure or benefit.

Some proponents of [[evidence-based medicine]] suggest discontinuing the use of any treatment that has not been shown to provide a measurable benefit. Futile care is distinct from [[euthanasia]] because euthanasia involves active intervention to end life, while withholding futile medical care does not encourage or hasten the natural onset of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cassidy |first1=Barry|last2=Blessing|first2=Dennis |date=August 23, 2007 |title=Ethics and Professionalism: A Guide for the Physician Assistant |publisher=F.A. Davis Company |page=155 |isbn= 0803613385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
In the broadest sense, futile care is care that does not benefit the patient as a whole, including physical, spiritual, or other benefits. This may be interpreted differently in various legal, ethical, or religious contexts. Clinicians and health care providers may need to rely on a more narrow definition of futile care in order to make decisions about a patient's health care, and this definition often centers around an assessment of the likelihood that a patient could physically recover as a result of treatment, or the likelihood of such treatment to relieve a patient's suffering. Examples of futile care may be a surgeon operating on a terminal cancer patient even when the surgery will not alleviate suffering; or doctors keeping a [[brain-dead]] person on [[life-support]] machines for reasons other than to procure their organs for donation. It is a sensitive area that often causes conflicts among medical practitioners and patients or kin.

Many controversies surrounding the concept of futile care center around how futility is assessed differently in specific situations rather than on arguments in favor of providing futile care ''per se''. It is difficult to determine when a particular course of action may fall under the definition of futile medical care, because of the difficulty in defining the point at which there is no further benefit to intervention in each case. For instance, a cancer patient may be willing to undergo yet more chemotherapy with a very expensive medication for the benefit of a few weeks of life, while medical staff, insurance company staff, and close relatives may believe this is a futile course of care.&lt;ref name="Khat"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Khatcheressian | first = J| last2 = Harrington | first2 = SB | last3 = ''et''|title = 'Futile Care': What to Do When Your Patient Insists on Chemotherapy That Likely Won’t Help| journal = Oncology| volume = 22| issue = 8| date = July 2008| url = http://www.cancernetwork.com/cme/article/10165/1168027?pageNumber=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 survey of more than 10,000 physicians in the United States found respondents divided on the issue of recommending or giving "life-sustaining therapy when [they] judged that it was futile", with 23.6% saying they would do so, 37% saying they would not, and 39.4% selecting "It depends".&lt;ref name=kane&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/731485_2 Doctors Struggle With Tougher-Than-Ever Dilemmas: Other Ethical Issues] Author: Leslie Kane. 11/11/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against providing futile medical care==

Arguments against providing futile care include potential harm to patients, family members, or caregivers with little or no likely benefits, and the diversion of resources to support the futile care of patients when resources could be used to provide care to patients that could respond to care.

Futile care does not offer benefits to the patient as a whole, and at the same time the physical, emotional, spiritual, economic, or ethical hardship and harm caused by futile care to the patient or to family members may be significant.

While futile care does not benefit patients, it may cost providers, the state, and patient families significant money and resources. In some cases, futile care involves the expenditure of resources that could be used by other patients with a good likelihood of achieving a positive outcome. For instance, in the case of [[Baby K]], attempts to transfer the infant to other centers were unsuccessful because there were no unoccupied [[pediatrics|pediatric]] [[Intensive Care Unit|ICU]] beds in the region. Many critics of that case insist that the medical expenses used to keep the [[anencephalic]] child on life support for over two years could have been better spent on awareness and prevention efforts for her condition.&lt;ref name="huffington-deathpanels"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/whats-so-wrong-with-death_b_366804.html |title=What's So Wrong with "Death Panels"? |first=Jacob M. |last=Appel |date=November 22, 2009 |work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues in futile care considerations==

The issue of futile care in clinical medicine generally involves two questions. The first concerns the identification of those clinical scenarios where the care would be futile. The second concerns the range of ethical options when care is determined to be futile.

===Assessment of futility in a clinical context===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Clinical scenarios vary in degrees and manners of futility. While scenarios like providing ICU care to the brain-dead patient or the [[Anencephaly|anencephalic]] patient when [[organ harvesting]] is not possible or practical are easily identifiable as futile, many other situations are less clear. 

Over the last four decades, the clinical community has improved the quality of [[prognosis|prognostic efforts]]. As a result, simple but imprecise rules of thumb like "percent mortality = age + percent burn" to judge the futility of burn cases involving elderly patients, have now given way to sophisticated algorithms based on multiple [[linear regression]] and other advanced [[statistics|statistic]]al techniques. These are complex clinical algorithms that have been scientifically validated and have considerable [[Positive and negative predictive values|clinical predictive value]], particularly in the case of patients suffering severe burns.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Such algorithms may provide high-quality prognostic information to aid patients and families in making difficult decisions, and have the potential to be used to guide resource allocation. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

These prognostic algorithms estimate the probability of the patient surviving. In a study of patients so severely burned that survival was clinically unprecedented, during the initial lucid period (before sepsis and other complications set in) patients were told that survival was extremely unlikely (i.e., that death was essentially inevitable) and were asked to choose between palliative care and aggressive clinical measures. Most chose aggressive clinical measures, which may suggest that the [[will to live]] in patients can be very strong even situations deemed hopeless by the clinician. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Another practical clinical example that often occurs in large hospitals is the decision about whether or not to continue resuscitation when the resuscitation efforts following an in-hospital [[cardiac arrest]] have been prolonged. A 1999 study in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' has validated an algorithm developed for these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Council on Ethical  |author2=Judicial Affairs, AMA |title= Medical Futility in End of Life Care |journal=JAMA |volume=281 |pages=937–941 |year=1999 |doi=10.1001/jama.281.10.937|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/281/10/937?lookupType=volpage&amp;vol=281&amp;fp=937&amp;view=short |pmid= 10078492 |issue= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As medical care improves and affects more and more chronic conditions, questions of futility have continued to arise. A relatively recent response to this difficulty in the United States is the introduction of the [[hospice]] concept, in which [[palliative care]] is initiated for someone thought to be within about six months of death. Numerous social and practical barriers exist that complicate the issue of initiating hospice status for someone unlikely to recover.&lt;ref name="Khat"/&gt;

===Options for futile care and futile care as a commodity ===

Another issue in futile care theory concerns the range of ethical options when care is determined to be futile. Some people argue that futile clinical care should be a market [[commodity]] that should be able to be purchased just like cruise vacations or luxury automobiles, as long as the purchaser of the clinical services has the necessary funds and as long as other patients are not being denied access to clinical resources as a result. In this model, [[Baby K]] would be able to get ICU care (primarily ventilatory care) until funding vanished. With rising medical care costs and an increase in extremely expensive new anti-cancer medications, the similar issues of equity often arise in treatment of end-stage cancer.&lt;ref name="Khat"/&gt;

'''HMAS ''AE1''''' (originally known as just '''''AE1'''''){{cn|date=September 2018}} was an [[British E-class submarine|E-class submarine]] of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). She was the first submarine to serve in the RAN, and was lost at sea with all hands near what is now [[East New Britain]], [[Papua New Guinea]], on 14 September 1914, after less than seven months in service. Search missions attempting to locate the wreck began in 1976. The submarine was found during the 13th search mission near the [[Duke of York Islands]] in December 2017. 

==Design and construction==
{{main|British E-class submarine}}
The E class was a version of the preceding [[British D-class submarine|D-class submarine]] enlarged to accommodate an additional pair of [[broadside]] [[torpedo tube]]s.&lt;ref name=BR4&gt;Harrison, Chapter 4: ''Pre-1914 Saddle Tank Types D &amp; E Classes''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''AE1'' was {{convert|181|ft|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|6|in|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|6|in|1}}.&lt;ref name=g7/&gt; She [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|750|LT|t}} on the surface&lt;ref name=Frame97&gt;Frame, ''No Pleasure Cruise'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|810|LT|t|abbr=on}} submerged. The E-class boats had a designed diving depth of {{convert|100|ft|m|1}}, but the addition of watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] strengthened the hull and increased the actual diving depth to {{convert|200|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref name=BR4/&gt; The complement consisted of 34 men: officers and [[naval rating|ratings]].&lt;ref name=g7&gt;Gillett, ''Australian &amp; New Zealand Warships, 1914–1945'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The boat had two propellers, each of which was driven by an eight-cylinder,&lt;ref name=Frame97/&gt; {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]] as well as a {{convert|420|bhp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. This arrangement gave the E-class submarines a maximum speed of {{convert|15|kn|lk=in}} while surfaced and {{convert|10|kn}} when submerged.&lt;ref name=g7/&gt; They carried approximately {{convert|40|LT|t}}&lt;ref name=BR4/&gt; of [[fuel oil]], which provided a range of {{convert|3000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}} while on the surface&lt;ref name=g7/&gt; and {{convert|65|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|5|kn}} while submerged.&lt;ref name=BR4/&gt; ''AE1'' had four [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] torpedo tubes, one each in the bow and stern, plus two on the broadside, one firing to port and the other to starboard. The boat carried one spare torpedo for each tube. No guns were fitted.&lt;ref name=g7/&gt;

''AE1'' was built by [[Vickers Limited]] at [[Barrow-in-Furness]], England,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-ae1 HMAS AE1] www.navy.gov.au Retrieved 23 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; having been laid down on 14 November 1911 and launched on 22 May 1913 and commissioned into the RAN on 28 February 1914.&lt;ref name="RAN"&gt;Sea Power Centre Australia, ''HMAS AE1''.&lt;/ref&gt; After commissioning, ''AE1'', accompanied by {{HMAS|AE2||2}}, the other of the RAN's first two submarines, reached Sydney from England on 24 May 1914. Officers for the submarines were [[Royal Navy]] (RN) personnel, while the ratings were a mix of sailors drawn from the RN and RAN.&lt;ref name="subsearch"&gt;''Navy to hunt for lost sub'', in ''The Sydney Morning Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deployment and loss==
[[File:AE1 off Rabaul.jpg|thumb|right|''AE1'' with other Australian vessels off Rabaul on 9 September 1914]]
At the outbreak of [[World War I]], ''AE1'', commanded by Lieutenant Commander Thomas Besant, was part of the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]] sent to attack [[German New Guinea]]. Along with ''AE2'', she took part in the operations leading to the occupation of the German territory, including the surrender of [[Rabaul]] on 13 September 1914. The submarine's involvement was recognised in 2010, following an overhaul of the RAN [[battle honour]]s system, with the retroactive award of the honour "Rabaul 1914".&lt;ref name=newhonours&gt;Royal Australian Navy, ''Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle Honours''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=honourslist&gt;Royal Australian Navy, ''Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours''&lt;/ref&gt;

At 07:00 on 14 September, ''AE1'' departed [[Blanche Bay]], Rabaul, to patrol off [[Cape Gazelle]] with {{HMAS|Parramatta|D55|6}}. When she had not returned by 20:00, several ships were dispatched to search for her. No trace of the submarine was found, and she was listed as lost with all hands. The disappearance was Australia's first major loss of World War I.&lt;ref name="subsearch"/&gt;

After the discovery of the submarine in December 2017, Rear Admiral Peter Briggs, retired, said the likely cause of its loss was a diving accident.&lt;ref name="Zhou"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhou|first1=Naaman|title=Australian navy world war one AE1 submarine found 103 years after it vanished|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/21/australian-navy-world-war-one-ae1-submarine-found-103-years-after-it-vanished|website=The Guardian|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added:

{{Quote|The submarine appears to have struck the bottom with sufficient force to dislodge the fin from its footing, forcing it to hinge forward on its leading edge, impacting the casing.&lt;ref name="Zhou" /&gt;}}

On 14 September 2018, a team of researchers headed by the [[Australian National Maritime Museum|National Maritime Museum]] director Kevin Sumption concluded their investigation into the sinking of ''AE1''. They concluded that a ventilation valve, which was likely open to make the tropical conditions a little more bearable while the submarine was cruising on the surface near the [[Duke of York Islands]], was insecure when the submarine dived causing a flood of the submarine's engine room and total loss of control of the ''AE1''. The submarine subsequently sank below 100 metres and imploded, killing everyone on board instantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sbs.com.au/news/researchers-discover-what-sunk-australia-s-first-submarine | title = Researchers discover what sunk Australia's first submarine | publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS World News Australia]] | first=Myles | last=Morgan | date=2018-09-14 | accessdate = 2018-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searches for wreck==

Beyond the search immediately after the submarine's disappearance, there were no concentrated efforts to locate the wreck of ''AE1'' until the 1970s, when John Foster, a RAN officer working in Port Moresby, became interested in the story. After researching wartime records, Foster persuaded the RAN to deploy the survey ship [[HMAS Flinders (GS 312)|HMAS ''Flinders'']] in 1976. ''Flinders'' found one potential sonar contact, but did not have a sophisticated enough [[side-scan sonar]] to make a determination either way. During a deployment to Papua New Guinea in 1978, ''Flinders'' conducted several ad-hoc searches, again with no useful result. In 1990, while sailing between New Britain and New Ireland, [[Jacques Cousteau]] diverted his ship, [[RV Calypso|''Calypso'']], to investigate the potential contact found in 1976. His original plan was to investigate up close with a submersible, but mechanical issues prevented it, and ''Calypso'' instead performed a [[magnetometer]] search of the area, finding no wrecks.&lt;ref name=HunterSearch&gt;Hunter, ''The Search for AE1 Continues''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Papua New Guinea map.png|thumb|left|Map of the region where ''AE1'' was lost in September 1914]]

Foster had continued archive research into ''AE1''{{'}}s disappearance, supplemented with visits to Rabaul and nearby islands to see if references to the submarine appeared in any community's [[oral history|oral histories]]. By 2002, he was focused on the waters off [[Mioko Island]] in the [[Duke of York Islands]] group: a priest from a Catholic mission had stated that members of the community had spotted a wrecked submarine on Wirian Reef while diving for shells. Attempts to dive the reported site of the wreck in 2002 and early 2003 were unsuccessful: the former was called off due to high shark presence, the latter expedition also was hampered by shark activity and found no wreck at the reported location. A third expedition in November 2003, supported by the [[Western Australian Museum|Maritime Museum of Western Australia]] and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], conducted searches off Mioko and nearby islands, again with no success.&lt;ref name=HunterSearch/&gt;&lt;ref name="MMWA"&gt;Green, ''The search for the AE1''&lt;/ref&gt; Further oral evidence supporting the wreck of ''AE1'' being off Mioko was learned during one of the 2003 expeditions: Foster discovered that the [[Tolai people]] had a legend of a "devil fish" appearing offshore on the day that ''AE1'' disappeared.&lt;ref name=HunterSearch/&gt;

In February 2007, a new effort to locate the submarine was mounted by the RAN, when the survey ships {{HMAS|Benalla|A 04|2}} and {{HMAS|Shepparton|A 03|2}} attempted to locate the submarine off [[East New Britain]].&lt;ref name="subsearch"/&gt; ''Benalla'' located an object on Wirian Reef of the appropriate dimensions using sonar on 1 March, but was unable to verify the nature of the object due to a damaged magnetometer.&lt;ref name=HunterSearch/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH Mar0107"&gt;Australian Associated Press, ''Missing WWI sub may have been found''&lt;/ref&gt; The minehunter {{HMAS|Yarra|M 87|6}} was sent to investigate the object further in late 2007.&lt;ref name=HunterSearch/&gt; Sonar and [[remotely-operated vehicle]] (ROV) imagery of the object revealed shape and dimensions similar to the submarine, but subsequent analysis by the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]] identified the object as a rock formation.&lt;ref name=HunterSearch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Resurface of mystery'', in ''Navy News''&lt;/ref&gt;

Foster organised another search in May 2009, partially funded by Channel Seven's [[Sunday Night (Australian TV program)|''Sunday Night'']], based on claims by a Rabaul-based salvage diver that he had seen the wreck in [[Simpson Harbour]] back in 1971, in proximity to the wreck of the Japanese merchant ship [[SS Keifuku Maru|''Keifuku Maru'']]. Diver searches of the site specified by the salvager failed to find either wreck. A follow-up search later that year by the Western Australian Maritime Museum found that ''Keifuku Maru'' had been buried under {{convert|30|m}} of rock during the 1994 [[Rabaul caldera]] eruption, but found no evidence of ''AE1'', buried or otherwise.&lt;ref name=HunterSearch/&gt; John Foster died in 2010 with the search for ''AE1'' continued by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=James|title=The search for AE1 continues|url=http://stories.anmm.gov.au/ae1/the-search-for-ae1/|publisher=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foster|first1=Michael|title=Celebrated sailor searched the sea for our sub: John Foster, 1935-2010.|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/celebrated-sailor-searched-the-sea-for-our-sub-20101110-17nlf|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During early 2012, the minehunter {{HMAS|Gascoyne|M 85|6}} and the survey ship {{HMNZS|Resolution|A14|6}} detected a potential wrecked submarine in Simpson Harbour. Although initially suspected to be ''AE1'', the wreck was determined to be a [[World War II]]-era Japanese midget submarine.&lt;ref name=HunterSearch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coutts&gt;Coutts, ''Submarine wreckage located in Rabaul harbour''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Resolution'' later conducted sonar surveys of areas in which ''AE1'' may have been lost, with no wrecks found.&lt;ref name=HunterSearch/&gt;

Between 6 and 9 September 2014, ''Yarra'' conducted searches around the Duke of York Islands, prior to a memorial service for the centenary of the submarine's disappearance.&lt;ref name=Barlass&gt;Barlass, ''A century on and a sonar blip: has navy found WWI submarine?''&lt;/ref&gt; Although numerous sonar "contacts of interest" were made during the search, including one which was singled out for further investigation, all were found to be natural terrain.&lt;ref name=HunterSearch/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAP10Sept&gt;Australian Associated Press, ''Possible clue found in hunt for AE1 sub''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barlass/&gt;

In September 2015, plans for a new search were announced by Find AE1 Limited. The search off Mioko Island was carried out in November, and was conducted by a mining survey ship towing a [[multibeam echosounder]] array. At the time of the search, Find AE1 stated that if the attempt was unsuccessful, they planned to petition the Australian government to bring in the search equipment used during the [[search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]]. The 2015 search was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=McPhedran2015&gt;McPhedran, ''Best shot at solving mystery of lost submarine AE1 with hi-tech search off Papua New Guinea''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/what-happened-to-hmas-ae1/ |title=What happened to HMAS AE1? |author=Briggs, Peter |publisher=ASPI |accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors have been identified as having hampered the efforts to find ''AE1''. The volcanic nature of the region resulted in a rugged and highly variable underwater topography, with a high frequency of wreck-like acoustic anomalies. Much of the region is deep water, which limited the techniques and tools that could be used to locate and verify the wreck. Volcanic activity was also identified as a factor, due to the disruption it causes to local magnetic fields, affecting the operations of magnetometers. There were concerns that eruptions and underwater earthquakes may have caused the underwater landscape to change, or break up or bury the wreck. Additionally, the search areas contained large numbers of shipwrecks due to heavy military activity around New Guinea during World War II, along with the disposal of ships in later years.&lt;ref name="HunterSearch" /&gt;

===Discovery===

In December 2017, another search – the 13th&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-21/hmas-ae1-submarine-found-after-century-long-search/9278782 |title=HMAS AE1 World War I submarine found after century-long search |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – was conducted using the survey ship [[MV Fugro Equator|''Fugro Equator'']], off the Duke of York Islands. This expedition was funded by the Commonwealth Government and the Silentworld Foundation with additional assistance from the [[Submarine Institute of Australia]] and the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref name="RAN-Dec2017"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.navy.gov.au/en/Dec2017/Fleet/4389/%E2%80%98FOUND%E2%80%99---Australian-Navy-Submarine-HMAS-AE1-located-after-103-years.htm |title='Found': Australian Navy Submarine HMAS AE1 located after 103 years |newspaper=[[Navy News]] |date=21 December 2017 |accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Department of Defence|title=$500,000 grant to help find HMAS AE1|url=http://news.navy.gov.au/en/Nov2017/Fleet/4232/$500000-grant-to-help-find-HMAS-AE1.htm|work=Navy Daily|date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this effort, the submarine was found at a depth of {{convert|300|m}} and was seen to be well preserved and in one piece.&lt;ref name="RAN-Dec2017"/&gt; The ''[[RV Petrel]]'' was enlisted to survey the wreckage.

In 1933, a stained-glass window commemorating the losses of ''AE1'' and ''AE2'' was added to the [[Garden Island Naval Chapel|naval chapel at Garden Island]] in Sydney. In September 2015, a floating sculpture to commemorate ''AE1'' was unveiled outside the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref name=Fletcher&gt;Fletcher, ''Remembering AE1: '...the ocean bed their tomb{{'}}''&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture takes the form of a stainless steel wreath, {{convert|6|m}} in diameter, which projects patterns of light onto the water at night.&lt;ref name=Fletcher/&gt; In 2008 a memorial plaque was dedicated to HMAS ''AE1'' at the [[Tasmanian Seafarers Memorial|Tasmanian Seafarers' Memorial]] at [[Triabunna]] on the east coast of Tasmania, commemorating the loss of L.S. Cyril Lefroy Baker RAN, Telegraphist, the first Tasmanian killed in his country's service in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HMAS Submarine AE1 (1914)|url=http://seafarersmemorial.org.au/memorials/vessels/ae1.php|website=seafarersmemorial.org.au|publisher=Tasmanian Seafarers Memorial|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hasan ibn Ali ibn Muhammad''' ({{Circa}} 846 – 874) was the 11th [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]] of [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]], after his father [[Ali al-Hadi]].  He was also called '''Abu Muhammad''' and '''Ibn al-Ridha.''' Because [[Samarra]], the city where he lived, was a garrison town, he is generally known as '''al-Askari''' (''Askar'' is the word for ''military'' in Arabic). Al-Askari married [[Narjis|Narjis Khatun]] and was kept under house arrest or in prison for most of his life. According to some Shia sources, he was poisoned at the age of 28 on the orders of the Abbasid caliph [[Al-Mu'tamid]] and was buried in Samarra. It was known that many Shia were looking forward to the succession of his son, [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], as they believed him to be the twelfth [[The Twelve Imams|Imam]], who was destined to remove injustice from the world.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tabataba'i |first=Muhammad Husayn |title=Shi'ite  Islam |year=1979 |publisher=State University of New York Press |pages=184–185 &amp; 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chittick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabåatabåa'åi|first1=Muhammad Husayn|title=A Shi'ite Anthology|date=1981|others=Selected and with a Foreword by [[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i]]; Translated with Explanatory Notes by [[William Chittick]]; Under the Direction of and with an Introduction by [[Hossein Nasr]] |publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780585078182|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbin 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corbin|first1=Henry|title=The History of Islamic Philosophy|date=2001|publisher=Kegan Paul International|others=Translated by Liadain Sherrard with the assistance of Philip Sherrard|location=London and New York|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sharif al-Qrashi"&gt;{{harvnb|Shareef al-Qurashi|2005|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliash, J.

==Birth and early life==
In 231 or 232 A.H., Hasan al-Askari was born in [[Medina]].&lt;ref name="q"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Halm |first1=H. |title=ASKARĪ |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/askari-abu-mohammad-hasan-b |website=iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwight Donaldson has put al-Askari's birth near the time [[Al-Mutawakkil]] transferred his father, [[Ali al-Hadi]], from Medina to [[Samarra]]. It is unclear whether he was born in Samarra or Medina.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; Hans Halm has set 233 or 234 A.H.(849 A.D.) as the date of the departure of Hasan al-Askari with his father.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Wilferd Madelung]] considers  23 [[Ramadan]] 233 AH (5 May, 848 A.D.) the date of their entry into Samarra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Madelung |first1=Wilferd. |title=ALĪ AL-HĀDĪ, |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ali-al-hadi-abul-hasan-b |website=iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt; so he spent most of his life there.&lt;ref name="q"/&gt; According to authentic Shia [[Hadith]] he was born in Medina on the 8th of Rabiul Akhar 232 [[Hijri year|Hijri]] (4 December 846 AD) and died in Samarra Iraq on the 8th of [[Rabi' al-awwal|Rabiul Awwal]] 260 Hijri (4 January 874) aged 28. The period of his [[imamate]] was six years. He was taken along with his family to Samarra in the year 230, 231 or 232 A.H., and was kept there under house arrest. In Samarra, al-Askari spent most of his time reading the [[Quran]] and the [[Sharia]]. According to Donaldson, al-Askari must also have studied languages. In later years it was known that he could speak [[Hindi]] with the pilgrims from [[India]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]] with the [[Turkish people|Turk]]s, and [[Persian language|Persian]] with the Persians.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=Dwight M.|title=The Shi'ite Religion: A History of Islam in Persia and Irak|year=1933|pp=217–222|publisher=BURLEIGH PRESS}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shia accounts, however, it is part of the divine knowledge given to all [[The Twelve Imams|Imam]]s to be able to speak all human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Qurashi|first1=Baqir Shareef|title=The Life of Imam ‘Ali al-Hadi, Study and Analysis|publisher=Ansariyan Publications|page=82|location=Qum|others=Abdullah al-Shahin|url=http://www.al-islam.org/life-imam-ali-al-hadi-study-and-analysis-baqir-shareef-al-qurashi|accessdate=25 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084825/http://www.al-islam.org/life-imam-ali-al-hadi-study-and-analysis-baqir-shareef-al-qurashi|archive-date=6 October 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Osule Kafi|last = Koleini|first = Mohammad|publisher = Islamie|year = 1362|isbn = |location = Tehran|pages = 509 &amp; 285|volume = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al-Askari Mosque.jpg|289px|thumb|[[Al-Askari Mosque]] before the [[2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing|2006 bombing]]]]

It is said that even as a child, al-Askari was endowed with divine knowledge. One day a man passed by him and saw that he was crying. The man told him he would buy a toy that he might play with. "No!" said al-Askari, "We have not been created for play." The man was amazed at this answer and said, "Then, what for have we been created?" "For knowledge and worship", answered the child. The man said, "Where have you got this from?" Al-Askari said, "From the saying of [[Allah|God]], {{'}}''Did you then think that We had created you in vain''{{'}}."{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#23:115 Quran, 23:115]}} The man was confused, so he asked, "What has happened to you while you are guiltless, little child?" Al-Askari replied, "Be away from me! I have seen my mother set fire to big pieces of firewood, but fire is not lit except with small pieces, and I fear that I shall be from the small pieces of the firewood of the Hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shareef al-Qurashi|2005|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ihqaq-al-Haq|last = Shoushtari|first = Noorollah|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |page = 473|volume = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Askari's mother, as in the case of most of The Twelve Imams, was a slave girl who was honoured after bearing children with the title ''Umm walad'' (mother of offspring).

==Family==
Various legends relate to al-Askari's wife, [[Narjis|Narjis Khatun]] (the mother of the twelfth Imam, [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]]). It is said that al-Askari's father, Ali al-Hadi, wrote a letter in the script of [[Rûm]], put it in a red purse with 220 [[dinar]]s, and gave it to his friend Bashar ibn Sulaiman. The letter instructed him to go to [[Baghdad]], to a ferry dock on the river where the boats from [[Syria]] were unloaded, and female slaves were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tabataba'i |first1=Allamah |title=A Shi'ite Anthology |publisher=Muhammadi Trust of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (December 1980) |isbn=978-0950698601 |pages=152 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Shi_ite_Anthology.html?id=OcdEtIIu_QcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bashar was told to look out for a shipowner named Amr ibn Yazid, who had a slave girl who would call out in the language of Rûm: "Even if you have wealth and the glory of [[Solomon]] the son of David, I can never have affection for you, so take care lest you waste your money." And that if a buyer approached her, she would say, "Cursed be the man who unveils my eyebrow!" Her owner would then protest, "But what recourse do I have I; I am compelled to sell you?" The Imam said, "You will then hear the slave answer, 'Why this hast, let me choose my purchaser, that my heart may accept him in confidence and gratitude'."

Bashar gave the letter to the slave girl as he was instructed. She read it and was unable to keep from crying afterward. Then she said to Amr ibn Yezid, "Sell me to the writer of this letter, for if you refuse I will surely kill myself." "I therefore talked over the price with Amr until we agreed on the 220 dinars my master had given me," said Bashar. On her way to Samarra, the slave girl would kiss the letter and rub it to her face and body; and when asked by Bashar why she did so despite not knowing the writer of the letter, she said, "May the offspring of the Prophet dispel your doubts!" Later, however, she gave a full description of the dream she had, and how she had escaped from her father's palace. A lengthier version of this story is recorded in Donaldson's book, along with further discussion on its authenticity.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

Some Shia sources have recorded her as being a "Roman (i.e. Byzantine) princess" who pretended to be a slave so that she might travel from her kingdom to [[Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brill |first=Maulana Jibrill |title=The Expected Mahdi |url=http://www.al-shia.com/html/eng/articles/mahdi/almahdi/02.htm |date=2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104033157/http://www.al-shia.com/html/eng/articles/mahdi/almahdi/02.htm |archive-date=4 November 2005 |website=www.al-shia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://al-islam.org/help/onlinecourses.html|title=Online Islamic Courses|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513180535/http://www.al-islam.org/help/onlinecourses.html|archive-date=13 May 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moezzi&gt;{{cite web|last=Amir-Moezzi|first=Mohammad Ali|title=ISLAM IN IRAN vii.

About his descendants, there are different views. According to many collections of Sunni and Shi'a hadith, his only son was [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Mohammed]], who was born in 255 A.H.(869 A.D.). Some sources enumerate up to three girls and three boys as his offspring. Some others say he did not have any offspring.&lt;ref name="q"/&gt;

==Imamate==
Shia believe that Hasan al-Askari gained the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamate]] after the death of his father—by divine command, as well as by the decrees of the previous Imams—at the age of 22. During the seven years of his Imamate, Hasan al-Askari lived in dissimulation (''[[taqiyah]]''), without any social contact,&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sachedina |first1=Abdulaziz Abdulhussein |title=Islamic Messianism: The Idea of the Mahdi in Twelver Shi'ism |publisher=SUNY Press; 1st edition (June 1, 1981) |isbn=978-0873954587 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Islamic-Messianism-Mahdi-Twelver-Shiism/dp/0873954580}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Abbasid]] Caliphs were afraid of the increasing popularity of [[Shia Islam]] at the time. The Caliphs also came to know that the leaders among the Shia believed that the eleventh Imam would have a son who was the promised Mahdi.{{efn| The coming of the [[Mahdi]] had been foretold by both Shia and Sunni traditions. See ''Sahih of Tirmidhi''. Cairo, 1350-52. Vol. IX, chapter "Ma ja a fi’l-huda";

Due to these fears, the Caliphs of the time had decided to put an end to the Imamate of Shi'ism once and for all.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt;

===Under the rule of the Abbasid Caliphs===
Hasan al-Askari lived almost his entire life under house arrest in Samarra and under the supervision of the [[Abbasid]] caliphs. He was not allowed to communicate with others and wore the ''[[Taqiyah (cap)|Taqiyah]]'' (cap).&lt;ref name="EncycOfMedivalIslamicCiv"&gt;{{cite book|author=Meri, Josef W.|year=2005|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|location=USA|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-96690-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say, however, that due to visits made on his traffic route, at the beginning of his imamate, he had a little freedom. According to [[Abdulaziz Sachedina|Sachedina]] and Jassim M. Hussain, during his house arrest, al-Askari named a personal deputy to guide the Shia in religious thought and collect religious taxes (''[[Khums]]'', ''[[Zakat]]'', etc.).&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hussain |first1=Jassim M. |title=The Occultation of the Twelfth Imam (A Historical Background) |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (December 6, 2013) |isbn=978-1494350987 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Occultation_of_the_Twelfth_Imam.html?id=ilfYAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He organized [[Network of agents (Wikalah)|The institution of the deputyship (''wikala'')]].&lt;ref name="q"/&gt; He criticized the rulers for appropriating the wealth of the nation and extorting the people under their rule by not communicating with or cooperating with the kings of his time. The state remained in a political crisis, as the Abbasid Caliphs were considered [[puppets]] of the Turks, who were seen as ruling through [[terrorism]]. After the death of al-Askari's father, Ali al-Hadi, the Caliph [[Al-Mu'tazz]] summoned him to Baghdad, where he was kept in prison during the short rule of the next Caliph, [[Al-Muhtadi]]. Most of his prison time, however, was during the reign of the succeeding Caliph, [[Al-Mu'tamid]], who is known in Shia sources as the main oppressor of the Imam.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; The Imam's death has largely been attributed to [[poison]] administered by al-Mu'tamid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shareef al-Qurashi|2005|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The al-Mu'tamid era coincided with the rebellion of the [[Alawites]], and people allied to them, so al-Askari was released from prison, from 256 to 260 A.H. The news of his death was published in his home.&lt;ref name="q"/&gt;

===Divisions===
There was a large sect of Shia, the [[Waqifite Shia|Waqifiyya]], who believed that the Imamate stopped with the seventh Imam, [[Musa al-Kadhim]]. They were unwilling to approve the succession of the remaining five Imams. Also, Ja’far, the son of the tenth Imam, claimed to be Imam after the death of his brother, al-Askari, and was followed by a group of Shia. However, this group disbanded soon afterwards, as Ja’far himself gave up his claim. Except for [[Zaidiyyah]] and [[Isma'ilism]], which continue to the present day, all other minority sects of Twelver Shia were dissolved in a short period, except for the division made by Ibn Nusayr after the death of Al-Askari, which later became the Alawites.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt;

==Expertise==
During their lifetimes, the Shia Imams trained hundreds of scholars whose names and works can be found in biographical books.{{efn| See ''Kitab al-rijal of Kashshi''; ''Rijal of Tusi''; ''Fihrist of Tusi'', and other biographical works ''(rijal)''.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt; During the time of the Eleventh Imam, however, some Shia saw Islamic religious life as being in shambles. The Imam was under house arrest&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; and many non-believers took advantage of this to question religion, in spite of the Imam's continuing to speak out against those who questioned the Qur'an. An account of this can be found in a [[''tafsir'']] ascribed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-qurashi |first1=Baqir Shareef |title=The Life of Imam Al-hasan Alaskari |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (November 16, 2015) |isbn=978-1519332998 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about /The_Life_of_Imam_Al_hasan_Alaskari.html?id=mnFSngEACAAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious skepticism was manifested in a book entitled ''The Contradiction of the Quran'', by [[Abd al-Masih ibn Ishaq al-Kindi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muhammadanism.org/Al-Kindi/p018-019.htm|title=The Apology of Al-Kindy|website=muhammadanism.org|access-date=2017-10-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028201228/http://muhammadanism.org/Al-Kindi/p018-019.htm|archive-date=28 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the book came to al-Askari, who met one of al-Kindi's disciples and said to him, "Is there no wise man among you to prevent your teacher, al-Kindi, from that which he has busied himself with?" The disciple answered that they were al-Kindi's disciples and were unable to object. Later on, Hasan al-Askari instructed the disciple how to question al-Kindi.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Go to him, be courteous with him, and show him that you will help him in what he is in. When he feels comfortable with you, you say to him, ''If someone recites the Quran, is it possible that he means other meanings than what you think you understand?'' He shall say that ''it is possible because he is a man who understands when he listens.'' If he says that, you say to him, ''How do you know? He might mean other than the meanings that you think, and so he fabricates other than its (the Qur'an) meanings....''&lt;ref name="book162-163"&gt;{{harvnb|Shareef al-Qurashi|2005|pp=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The disciple did as al-Askari advised him; and Al-Kindi was shrewd enough to say, "...no one like you can get to this. Would you tell me where you have got this from?" And when he heard the true story said, "Now you say the truth. Like this would not come out except that house (the [[Ahlul Bayt]])…". It is said that al-Kindi burnt his book afterwards.&lt;ref name="book162-163"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manaqib e Ale Abi Talib|last = Shahr Ashoub|first = Abu Abdullah Ali|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |page = 424|volume = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tafsir al-Askari===
Despite being confined to house arrest for almost his entire life, Hasan al-Askari was able to teach others about Islam, and even compiled a commentary on the Quran that became known as ''Tafsir al-Askari''. However, there was much suspicion about whether it truly was his work. The ''tafsir'' was thought by some to have a weak chain of authorities ''([[Science of hadith#Sanad and matn|Sanad]])'', which is an essential part of the transmission of a tradition.&lt;ref name="q"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Robson |first=J. |title=Isnād |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/isnad-SIM_3665?s.num=0&amp;s.q=Isn%C4%81d&amp;s.f.s2_parent_title=Encyclopaedia+of+Islam%2C+Second+Edition |editor1-last=Bearman |editor1-first=P. |editor2-last=Bianquis |editor2-first=Th. |editor3-last=Bosworth |editor3-first=C.E. |editor4-last=van Donzel |editor4-first=E. |editor5-first=W.P. |editor5-last=Heinrichs |date=13 April 2010 |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam |edition=Second |publisher=Brill Online.

The main reason people questioned its validity was the fact the Imam was under constant watch by the Abbasid government, which prevented any contact between him and other Shia, making it impossible for such knowledge to be transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shareef al-Qurashi|2005|pp=80–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Al-Askari Mosque 2006.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[Al-Askari Mosque]] in Samarra, Iraq]]

Opinions differ on the cause of Hasan al-Askari’s death. Some believe he died from illness.&lt;ref name="q"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sharif al-Qrashi"/&gt; But, according to some Shia sources, others think he was poisoned at the age of 28 at the instigation of the [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[Al-Mu'tamid]] and died on the 8th [[Rabi' al-awwal|Rabi' al-Awwal]] 260 AH (approximately: 4 January 874 and 16 November 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Calendar center of Geophysics institute of Tehran University, 1397 Calendar |url=https://calendar.ut.ac.ir/Fa/Tyear/Data%5Cfull-1397.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref name=booktwo&gt;Mufīd, Ibn-al-Muʻallim, I.

Jarir |title=Dala'il al-imama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rasul Jafarian, referring to historical documents and detention records of the sixth century A.H., stated that al-Askari opposed the Abbasid Caliph politically and that his death happened early in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jafarian |first1=Rasul |title=Human leaders}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', in all of the sources there is one common thread: that al-Mu'tamid wanted a declaration by medical practitioners that showed the people that al-Askari died a natural death.&lt;ref name="q"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ahmadi Birjandi |first1=Ahmad |title=The Fourteen Luminaries of Islam |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (November 8, 2015) |isbn=978-1519176325 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Fourteen_Luminaries_of_Islam.html?id=-CPUjgEACAAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When news of al-Askari's illness reached Caliph Al-Mu'tamid, he sent a physician and a group of his trusted men to observe the Imam's condition. After the death of the Imam, they had all his female slaves examined by the midwives. For two years, they searched for the successor of the Imam until they eventually lost hope. Al-Askari died on the very same day that his young son, [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who then was five or a little over, disappeared and started what was henceforth known as the [[The Occultation#Twelver|Minor Occultation]].&lt;ref name="Tabatabai" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson" /&gt;
Genealogy trees of Middle Eastern families, mostly from [[Persia]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], show that Imam Hasan al-Askari also had a second son called [[Sayyid Ali Akbar]]. These indicate that Imam al-Askari had children and tend to substantiate the existence of Imam Muhammad al Mahdi. The reason for dispute over whether Imam Al Askari had children or not is perhaps because of the political conflicts between the followers of the Imamah and the leadership of the Abbasids and Ghulat Shiites who had not believed in Imam Hasan al-Askaris Imamah. In fact, the eleventh Imam had two sons, Sayyid Muhammad (i.e. Imam Mahdi) and Sayyid Ali Akbar. Notable descendants of Sayyid Ali Akbar are Sufi saints such as [[Maudood Chishti]] and [[Bahauddin Naqshband]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:nia7sTjirh0J:http://baabeamoor.com/major-aulia-e-karam/hazrat-bahaauddin-naqshbandi-r-a/+Bahauddin+Naqshband+syed+bulaq&amp;newwindow=1&amp;hl=ru&amp;gbv=2&amp;ct=clnk|title=Faizan-e-Umoor.com » Hazrat Bahaauddin Naqshbandi (R.A)|first=Author: Mujtaba|last=Tariq|website=webcache.googleusercontent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studopedia.ru/14_23283_rod-bahauddina-nakshbanda-po-linii-materi-proishodit-ot-hazrata-abu-bakra-siddika-ra.html|title=Род Бахауддина Накшбанда по линии матери происходит от хазрата Абу Бакра Сиддика (р.а.)|website=Studopedia|access-date=24 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701154525/http://studopedia.ru/14_23283_rod-bahauddina-nakshbanda-po-linii-materi-proishodit-ot-hazrata-abu-bakra-siddika-ra.html|archive-date=1 July 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; descendant after 11 generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shajara.info/maqolalar |title=Naqshbandiya shajarasi izidan |access-date=3 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803171037/http://www.shajara.info/maqolalar |archive-date=3 August 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hazrat Ishaan|Khwaja Khawand Mahmud known as Hazrat Ishaan]], descendant after 18 generations and the three saintly brothers [[Sayyid Mir Jan|Sayyid ul Sadaat Sayyid Mir Jan]] [[Sayyid Mahmud Agha|Sayyid ul Sadaat Sayyid Mahmud Agha]] and Sayyid ul Sadaat Sayyid Mir Fazlullah, Qadhi ul Qudhad i.e. [[Justice ministry|chief of justice]] of the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]], maternal descendants of [[Imaam Hasan Askari ibn Ali Naqi|Imam Hasan al Askari]] and [[Hazrat Ishaan]].

Shias believe the birth of al-Askari's son, like that of the prophet [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], was concealed due to the difficulties of the time and because of the belief that the son was the promised Muhammad al-Mahdi, an important figure in Shia teachings. The Mahdi was believed to be destined to reappear before the end of time to fill the world with justice, peace, and to establish Islam as the global religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moezzi |first1=Amir |title=ShareThis ISLAM IN IRAN vii. THE CONCEPT OF MAHDI IN TWELVER SHIʿISM |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/islam-in-iran-vii-the-concept-of-mahdi-in-twelver-shiism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Askari's death coincided with the beginning of the imamate of the Mahdi.&lt;ref name="h"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Amini |first1=Ayatullah Ibrahim |title=Al-Imam al-Mahdi, The Just Leader of Humanity |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (November 15, 2015) |isbn=978-1519308696 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Al_Imam_Al_Mahdi.html?id=Jt0gnwEACAAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ja'far al Zaki, al-Askari's uncle, claimed that his brother never had a son.&lt;ref name="Misbah-uz-Zulam"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Imam |first1=Sayyid Imdad |title=Misbah-uz-Zulam, Roots of the Karbala’ Tragedy |publisher=Ansariyan Publications - Qum |isbn=978-964-219-103-1 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Misbah-uz-Zulam-Roots-Karbala-Tragedy/dp/B00G17R3CY |ref=claimed}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that when Ja'far al Zaki was about to say the prayer at his nephew's funeral, there appeared "a fair child, with curly hair, and shining teeth", who seized Ja'far's cloak and insisted on saying the prayer. A few days later, a group of Shia pilgrims from [[Qum]], ignorant of his death, came to visit al-Askari. The same Ja'far claimed to be the next Imam. The pilgrims said they would accept him if he would prove himself by telling them their names and indicating how much money they had. While Ja'far was protesting this examination, a servant of al-Mahdi appeared, saying that his master had sent him to inform them of their particular names and their specific amounts of money. Ja'far searched everywhere but could not find the boy, al-Mahdi. The doctrine of his [[the Occultation|''ghaiba'']] declares simply that the Mahdi has been "withdrawn by God from the eyes of men, that his life has been miraculously prolonged, that he has been seen from time to time and has been in correspondence with others, and maintains a control over the fortunes of his people".&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

Many Sunni do not believe the Mahdi has already been born,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/comparison_charts/islamic_sects.htm |title=Comparison of Shias and Sunnis |publisher=Religionfacts.com |accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a group of as many as 40 famous Sunni scholars including Al-Dhahabi, Ibn-Hajar, Abu al-Falah Hanbali and al-Qunduzi who believe that he has.&lt;ref&gt;Sheikh Najm al-Din al-Askari, Al-Mahdi Al-Mawood Al-Montazar Enda (by) Ahl al-Sunnah, Vol. 1, P. 220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shadharat al-dhahab (Beirut edition), Vol. 2, p. 141; al-'Ibar fi khabar min ghabar (Kuwait edition), Vol. 2, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3097">A '''holarchy''' is a connection between [[holon (philosophy)|holon]]s, where a ''holon'' is both a part and a whole. The term was coined in [[Arthur Koestler]]'s 1967 book ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]''.

Holarchy is commonly referred to as a form of [[hierarchy]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Funch|first=Fleming|title=Holarchies|url=http://www.worldtrans.org/essay/holarchies.html|work=World Transformation|date=February 4, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, hierarchy, by its definition, has both an absolute top and bottom.  But this is not logically possible in a [[Holon (philosophy)|holon]], as it is both a whole and a part.  The "hierarchical relationship" between holons at different levels can just as meaningfully be described with terms like "in and out", as they can with "up and down" or "left and right"; perhaps more generally, one can say that holons at one level are "made up of, or make up" the holons or parts of another level. This can be demonstrated in the holarchic relationship (subatomic particles ↔ atoms ↔ molecules ↔ macromolecules ↔ organelles ↔ cells ↔ tissues ↔ organs ↔ organisms ↔ communities ↔ societies) where each holon is a "level" of organization, and all are ultimately descriptive of the same set (e.g., a particular collection of matter). The top can be a bottom, a bottom can be a top, and, like a [[fractal]], the patterns evident at one level can be similar to those at another.

==Different meanings==

[[David Spangler]] uses the term in a different meaning: "In a [[hierarchy]], participants can be compared and evaluated on the basis of position, rank, relative power, seniority, and the like. But in a holarchy each person’s value comes from his or her individuality and uniqueness and the capacity to engage and interact with others to make the fruits of that uniqueness available."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |first=David|last=Spangler|date=October 30, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218163022/http://www.sevenpillarshouse.org/index.php/article/a_vision_of_holarchy1|archivedate=2012-02-18 |url=http://www.sevenpillarsreview.com/article/a_vision_of_holarchy1|title=A Vision of Holarchy|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2015-04-29|journal=Seven Pillars Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In multiagent systems ==

[[Multi-agent system|Multiagent systems]] are systems composed of autonomous software entities. They are able to simulate a system or to solve problems. A holarchy may be easily mapped to a hierarchy of agents in which an agent is composed of agents, and may have its own behavior defined as a partial consequence of these parts' behaviors.

[http://www.janus-project.org Janus Multiagent Platform] is a software platform able to execute holarchies of agents.

'''John Charles Bottarini''' (September 14, 1908 – October 8, 1976) was a right-handed [[catcher]] for the [[Chicago Cubs]] during the 1937 season. He did not see much playing time as the Cubs were anchored behind the plate by future Hall of Famer [[Gabby Hartnett]]. Bottarini appeared in 26 games for the Cubs that season and put up decent offensive numbers, hitting .275 in 40 at-bats with three doubles, a home run and 7 [[run batted in|RBI]]. He made 19 appearances in the field—18 at catcher and one in the outfield.

After the 1937 season, Bottarini was sold to Memphis of the minor league Southern Association. He would never play in the major leagues again.

Bottarini died by drowning after a boating accident on October 8, 1976 in [[Jemez Springs, New Mexico]].

A central theme of many religions is what happens to people upon death. Almost all religions are greatly devoted to the afterlife, emphasizing that what you do in your current life affects what happens to you in the [[afterlife]]. This usually takes the form of '''judgement''' by a deity, in which ones deeds and characteristics in life determine either punishment or reward (when one has been mostly good).

== Ancient religions ==
=== Ancient Egypt ===
[[Image:Egypt dauingevekten.jpg|thumb|right|A section of the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' written on papyrus showing the "Weighing of the Heart" in the [[Duat]].]]
In Ancient Egypt, it was believed that upon death, one's fate in the afterlife was determined by the weighing of one’s heart. One's heart was kept within the body during mummification so that it can travel with the deceased into the afterlife. Upon death, one entered the underworld ([[Duat]]), where [[Anubis]], the God of the dead, weighed the persons heart on a scale against the feather of [[Ma’at]], the goddess of order, truth, and righteousness. If the heart weighed more than the feather, meaning that the person was more wicked than good, then the heart would be devoured by [[Ammit]], a demon with the head of a crocodile, the front half of the body of a leopards, and the back half of a hippopotamus, but with goat arms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.touregypt.net/godsofegypt/ammit.htm&lt;/ref&gt; If a person's heart was devoured by Ammit, then he would die a second death and be completely annihilated from existence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/dead.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Greece ===
Ancient Greeks believed that upon death, an individual would enter the realm of Hades, the Greek underworld, and be judged by [[King Minos]], [[Aeacus]], and [[Radamanthus]]. Depending on one's actions in life, an individual would be sent to one of three different planes: [[Elysium]], the [[Asphodel Fields]], or [[Tartarus]]. Elysium is for those who were righteous in life and is reserved for good people and legendary heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Kosmos/Elysion.html|title=ELYSIUM, ISLAND OF THE BLESSED : Greek Mythology|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Elysium people relax and enjoy a life of everlasting joy in a beautiful and comfortable field with trees and sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0162:book=O.:poem=2|title=Pindar, Olympian, Olympian 2 For Theron of Acragas, Chariot Race, 476 B. C.|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0054%3Abook%3D6%3Acard%3D535 |title=P. Vergilius Maro, Aeneid, Book 6, line 535|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asphodel Fields is the land of neutrality, where those who were either neutral, or whose good and bad deeds are about equal reside. It is a bland place symbolizing their lack of notability in life. The final realm, Tartarus, is the realm of the wicked. It is the deepest realm of Hades, and those who have performed wicked deeds are punished here for eternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Kosmos/Tartaros2.html|title=TARTARUS, DUNGEON OF DAMNED : Greek mythology|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment here reflects the wicked deeds committed in one's life (e.g., [[Tantalus]] killed and fed his son to the Gods, so he was punished by being made to stand in a pool surrounded by trees with fruit, but can partake of neither water nor fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0022:text=Epitome:book=E:chapter=2&amp;highlight=tantalus|title=Apollodorus, Epitome, book E, chapter 2 |publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Mortals shared this realm with non-mortals.

== Dharmic==
[[Hinduism]] was extremely influential, with aspects and gods from Hinduism being borrowed into other religions not only in India, but also in China, Korea, and Japan. As such, many of the Asian religions have similarities in myths, deities, and concepts.

=== Hinduism ===
In Hinduism, people are judged by [[Yama]], the God of Death, in accordance with [[Karma]]. Depending on whether or not and how closely one adhered to one's duties in life, as well as one's deeds, they would be either punished or rewarded in their next life after reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312474/karma|title=karma – Indian philosophy|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who performed their duties and performed good deeds would reincarnate into a higher class, spending some time between lives in bliss in heaven, whereas those who did not follow the rules of their caste and performed bad deeds in life were either reincarnated into lower classes or lower lifeforms, such as animals, as well as sent to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] (the equivalent of Hell) and tortured by various means between lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/gpu/index.htm|title=The Garuda Purana|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several layers to Naraka, and people are sent to different ones for different punishments based on the severity and nature of their misdeeds in life.

=== Buddhism ===
[[Buddhism]] applies the principles of Karma and reincarnation much the same way that Hinduism does. There are several differing versions. In some there is no God that passes down judgement on individuals to either determine their future life or to reward or punish them for their current one. In such cases, humans, as well as all other beings except for the [[Buddha]]s who have reached Nirvana, simply follow the cycle of reincarnation based on Karma until they can reach Nirvana.{{cn|date=May 2017}} In some other versions of Buddhism, Yama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y53pT_gGE_0C&amp;pg=PA78|page=78|title=Buddhist Symbolism in Tibetan Thangkas: The Story of Siddhartha and Other Buddhas Interpreted in Modern Nepalese Painting|publisher=Binkey Kok|author=Ben Meulenbeld}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as conceptions of Naraka and punishment, are adopted from Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mantramañjari|author=Raimundo Panikkar|publisher=Raimundo Panikkar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M01LSxaneasC&amp;pg=PA884|page=884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese Religion ===
Chinese religion borrows heavily form Hinduism and Buddhism, including Yama and Naraka ([[Diyu]]). However, Karma and the Caste system is not employed; thus reincarnation, as well as rewards and punishment between lives and in Diyu, are based solely on good or bad deeds in life. The wicked are tortured in Diyu, which contains different levels with different punishments, just like in Hinduism, and are reincarnated either into humans with bad luck and conditions or into animals. Those who are righteous and good are either reincarnated into humans with good fortune and status or are accepted into heaven

== Abrahamic religions ==
=== Judaism ===
In [[Judaism]], judgement occurs by [[God]] during the transition from the current earthly world "Olam Ha-Zeh" to the world to come "[[Olam Ha-Ba]]", which is roughly the equivalent of paradise or Eden. Those who followed all of the seven laws given to Moses, including non-Jews, would be considered righteous gentiles and allowed to enter Olam Ha-Ba. In contrast, those who did not obey the rules and were wicked would spend time in [[Gehenna]] for spiritual purification. Gehenna was a fiery place similar to common conceptions of Hell, where the wicked would be tortured for a maximum of one year's time in order to purify them for Olam Ha-Ba. Those who were too wicked would instead be completely destroyed after being tortured in Gehenna.

=== The Catholic Church ===
Catholics believe that all men, women, and children whether just or unjust will be resurrected, and shall come to The Day of Judgment both in body and soul.&lt;ref&gt;1 Thess 4:16, Rev. 20:4–5, 1 Cor 15:52&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are judged according to their deeds.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. 20:12, Eccl. 12:14, Rom 2:6&lt;/ref&gt; Those found pure are saved and welcomed into the kingdom, for nothing impure shall pass through the gates of God's Kingdom, but those found wanting enter everlasting damnation.&lt;ref&gt;Rev 21:27, Matt. 5:8, Matt. 25:45, Catholic Catechism paragraphs 1020–1065&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics believe that while salvation is by and through the grace of God, that human cooperation with grace is necessary as evidenced by the Parable of The Talents.&lt;ref&gt;Matt. 25:14–30&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that the works done to merit salvation are not merited in virtue of the human's own being, who is a sinner, but as a servant and friend who acts well with the graces given them freely; thus faith without works is deemed Solo Fides and is rejected by Catholics, but so too works without Faith is rejected as Pelagianism by Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;James 2:14–26, Council of Diospolis&lt;/ref&gt; Judgment Day is thus considered to require both Faith as a gift from above, but also the works of the human are judged, just as a branch of a vine is judged by its fruits.&lt;ref&gt;John 15:15, Luke 3:9&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics also believe in Purgatory, but as a place that is pre-Judgment Day, a purifying locale for those preparing for The Day of Judgment. If souls are purifed before Judgment Day they are released where they join the Saints who are spirits without bodies, enjoying an intellectual vision of The Father who is without body, known as The Beautific Vision. There the Saints await The Day of Judgment knowing they will be resurrected to receive their bodies and will be judged pure by The Trinity, confirmed by the Apostles and Patriarchs.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. 4:4&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are humans judged on That Day, but so too are other creatures like angels,.&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 6:3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church differs from other World beliefs in that it maintains God cannot be a Higher Power, for this claims God is in time and space as one of many powers, but is necessarily outside all Creation. The Catholic God is thus transcendent in The Godhead, yet immanent in The Incarnation and present in Baptism. Most importantly, this God is said to be Three Persons in One Essence. Salvation is by good deeds worked through, by, and in the grace of God. The Ordo Salutis is thus: The Father calls one to Baptism in Christ, through The Holy Spirit, and then the believer cultivates the virtues of Fatih, Hope, and Love through work to merit salvation through the grace given them in the sacraments, and continuously fed by the sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;John 6:44, John 14:6&lt;/ref&gt; Christ's place in The Godhead is as Logos incarnate, as both the lamb of God given for the sins of the world and the High Priest, making him both the one sacrificing and the sacrifice, which still require human response and agency to God's first act of call and action.&lt;ref&gt;John 1:29, Rev. 5:6, Heb. 4:14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protestantism ===
Protestants believe that the deceased leave their bodies and their spirit faces judgement for sin by God. Since all humans sin, the only way into Heaven is faith in Jesus Christ,&lt;ref&gt;John 14:6, Solo Fides&lt;/ref&gt; who is both God's Son&lt;ref&gt;1 John 4:15&lt;/ref&gt; and God in human form.&lt;ref&gt;John 1:1&lt;/ref&gt; Good deeds in this life store up treasures in heaven – entering into Heaven (the true life) is worth far more than earthly riches and honor.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 6:20&lt;/ref&gt; All others go to Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 3:23&lt;/ref&gt; Once in Hell, people will suffer to varying degrees depending on their deeds in life.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 20:11–15&lt;/ref&gt; This punishment is eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Mark 9:48&lt;/ref&gt; When the world ends all of the dead will come back to life for their permanent judgement and placed in a new Heaven, Earth and Hell.&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 15:36–58&lt;/ref&gt; Protestantism differs from other World beliefs in that while it allows a distinct avenue for judgement by a Higher Power, passage into a comfortable eternal life cannot be earned, but happens due to the self-sacrifice of that Higher Power by Solo Fides.&lt;ref&gt;John 3:16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
In [[Islam]], there are two general paths after death: the first is [[Jannah]], roughly the equivalent of paradise, and the second is [[Jahannam]], the equivalent to Hell. One's assignment to Jannah or Jahannam are determined by one's deeds in life. Those who believe in and follow the rules laid out, as well as who perform good deeds, are allowed to enter Jannah, whereas those who do not believe in Islam or are unfaithful to it are punished in Jahannam. Jannah is a garden of perpetual bliss; its inhabitants live in a state of happiness and satisfaction with no worries or problems.

'''Kleggs''' are [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] [[mercenaries]] in the [[Judge Dredd]] [[comic book]]s.  

A Klegg looks rather like a large man with green, scaly skin and the head and tail of an [[alligator]] or [[crocodile]].  They only take payment in [[meat]], since they are pure [[carnivore]]s. They are reasonably intelligent, but their ferocity and propensity for eating their foes dominate others' perception of them. Their society - the Klegg Empire - is essentially [[feudal]].

==Publication history==
In the story "The Day The Law Died", the insane Chief [[Judge Cal]] hired in the Kleggs to put down a rebellion inspired and led by the outlawed [[Judge Dredd]].  With their "Klegg-Hounds" (alien beasts rather like large dogs with crocodilian heads, which track enemies by tasting the ground where they have passed) the Kleggs kept the citizens of [[Mega-City One]] cowed and terrorized.  Their battle-cry was "''Klegg-Hai! Klegg-Hai!"'' and, in ''The Day The Law Died'', they also preceded this with a war-song: "slicey slicey, oncey twicey, claw and fang'll kill Dredd nicely! Meaty beaty, chop 'em neatly, death or glory no retreatee!". Cal appointed their leader, [[List of minor characters in Judge Dredd#Grampus|Grampus]], deputy chief judge.

After Judge Cal's death, the Kleggs were [[outlaw]]ed from Mega-City One; any citizen who sees a Klegg is required to either kill it or report it immediately to the Judges so that they may do so.  Although most of them left, some remain, hidden here and there in the ruined parts of the city.  Due to bitter memories of the Kleggs, other, more peaceful aliens have found Mega-City One less than welcoming on occasion. A few rare Kleggs have since been allowed back into the city. &lt;ref&gt;Prog 1388: "Love Hurts"&lt;/ref&gt;

The space-set spinoff ''The Corps'' presented a brutal war of attrition between Mega-City One's [[Space Corps (comics)|Space Corps]] and the Klegg Empire in the Spiral Arm, and that the Empire had a peace treaty with [[Megacities in Judge Dredd#Asia|Sino-Cit]], with "peace fort" bases at the Kaeli moons that divided Klegg and Sinese space. In a soft [[retcon]], Corps commander Keitel said that the original Kleggs were "lard-butt mercs" who'd been banished from the Empire and that the imperial army were a more dangerous threat. &lt;ref&gt;Prosg 918 and 919, "The Corps Part 1-3", by [[Garth Ennis]], [[Colin MacNeil]], and Paul Marshall&lt;/ref&gt; The Kleggs themselves were even drawn differently, more muscular and menacing, and spoke in normal English to the Sinese. Later strips have ignored this look and gone back to the original Bolland design for all Kleggs.

Later strips and spin-off books have used the Kleggs as recurring mercenary characters. Other looks at the Klegg Empire itself included a one-off spinoff, ''The Kleggs!'', where an education was rare and only for those born into the ruling high [[caste]]; rule of the Empire was gained through "time honoured traditions of backstabbing and treachery", and in 2124 Chorr took command from his uncle Grand Warmaster Grusk after an accident with an alien superweapon. &lt;ref&gt;[[Judge Dredd Megazine]] #201: "The Kleggs!" by [[Ian Edginton]] and [[Mike Collins (comics)|Mike Collins]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2132, warlord Skull Khan Kirrz was on a war crime trial for committing the Edgeworld Marches atrocities. &lt;ref&gt;"Killer Elite", Judge Dredd Megazine #329&lt;/ref&gt; 

One mercenary, a reconstructed Klegg who didn't eat people and got quite upset that people assumed he did, was named Sensitive Klegg, given the rank of "Rear Admiral", and drafted by [[Dirty Frank (comics)|Dirty Frank]] during the ''[[Trifecta (Judge Dredd story)|Trifecta]]'' storyline. 

The Kleggs make an appearance in the [[Ace Trucking Co.]] strip, in the similarly titled adventure.

==In popular culture==
The Kleggs were the focus of a light-hearted piece in ''[[The Guardian]]'' during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|British 2010 general election campaign]], comparing them to [[Nick Clegg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Crace |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/04/kleggs-cleggs-head-to-head |title=The Kleggs and the Cleggs go head to head |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=May 4, 2010 |accessdate=May 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also president of the [[Royal College of Nursing]].&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=52050|title=Wilkinson [née Lumsden], Dame Louisa Jane (1889–1968), military nurse|first=Susan L. |last=  Cohen |authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkinson was born Louisa Lumsden in  [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]],  the daughter of merchant seaman James Lumsden and  Louisa Lumsden (''née'' Benskin). She was educated at Bede Collegiate School in Sunderland and Thornbeck Collegiate School in Darlington.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

The 22-year-old Lumsden began her training in 1911 at the Royal Infirmary in Sunderland. She had just finished her training when the First World War began in August 1914, and she promptly enlisted as a reserve in Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS). In December 1917,  but her husband was killed on active duty during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

On 20 December 1917 she married Capt. Robert John Wilkinson of the [[Royal Irish Fusiliers]] at the Fulham register office, but  killed in action barely six months later in France on 2 July 1918.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ireland, Casualties of World War I, 1914-1922''&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkinson became a regular member of the QAIMNS, and saw service during both World Wars. She was appointed Matron in Chief from 1944–48, and after retirement was named [[Colonel Commandant]].
Dame Louisa Wilkinson founded the [[QARANC]] Association in 1947.

She died in 1968 in [[Crowborough]] of a [[coronary thrombosis]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

'''Lungfish''' are freshwater [[rhipidistian]] fish belonging to the [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]] '''Dipnoi'''.  Lungfish are best known for retaining characteristics primitive within the [[Osteichthyes]], including the ability to breathe air, and structures primitive within [[Sarcopterygii]], including the presence of lobed fins with a well-developed internal skeleton.

Today there are only six known species of lungfish, living only in [[Africa]], [[South America]] and [[Australia]]. The fossil record show that lungfish were abundant since the Triassic.&lt;ref&gt;Agnolin, F. L., Mateus O., Milàn J., Marzola M., Wings O., Adolfssen J. S., &amp; Clemmensen L. B. (2018).  Ceratodus tunuensis, sp. nov., a new lungfish (Sarcopterygii, Dipnoi) from the Upper Triassic of central East Greenland. Journal of Vertebrate PaleontologyJournal of Vertebrate Paleontology. e1439834&lt;/ref&gt; While [[vicariance]] would suggest this represents an ancient distribution limited to the [[Mesozoic]] [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]], the [[fossil]] record suggests advanced lungfish had a widespread freshwater distribution and  the current distribution of modern lungfish species reflects [[extinction]] of many lineages subsequent to the breakup of [[Pangaea]], [[Gondwana]] and [[Laurasia]]. Lungfish have historically been referred to as '''salamanderfish''',&lt;ref name="Ernst Heinrich Philipp August Haeckel, Edwin Ray Lankester, L. Dora Schmitz 1892 422"&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Creation, Or, The Development of the Earth and Its Inhabitants by the Action of Natural Causes: A Popular Exposition of the Doctrine of Evolution in General, and of that of Darwin, Goethe, and Lamarck in Particular : from the 8. German Ed. of Ernst Haeckel |author=[[Ernst Haeckel|Ernst Heinrich Philipp August Haeckel]], Edwin Ray Lankester, L. Dora Schmitz |year=1892 |publisher=D. Appleton |page=422 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltUj8vk3auEC}} page 289&lt;/ref&gt; but this term more often refers to ''[[Lepidogalaxias salamandroides]]''.

==Anatomy and morphology==
All lungfish demonstrate an uninterrupted cartilaginous [[notochord]] and an extensively developed palatal dentition. [[Basal (phylogenetics)|Basal]] ("[[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive"]]) lungfish groups may retain marginal teeth and an ossified braincase, but derived lungfish groups, including all modern species, show a significant reduction in the marginal bones and a cartilaginous braincase.  The bones of the [[skull roof]] in primitive lungfish are covered in a [[mineralized tissues|mineralized tissue]] called [[cosmine]], but in post-[[Devonian]] lungfishes, the skull roof lies beneath the skin and the cosmine covering is lost.  All modern lungfish show significant reductions and fusions of the bones of the skull roof, and the specific bones of the skull roof show no [[Homology (biology)|homology]] to the skull roof bones of [[ray-finned fish]]es or [[tetrapods]]. During the breeding season, the South American lungfish develops a pair of feathery appendages that are actually highly modified pelvic fins. These fins are thought to improve gas exchange around the fish's eggs in its nest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Through [[convergent evolution]], lungfishes have evolved internal nostrils similar to the tetrapods' [[choana]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceweek.com/2004/sa041224-3.htm Evolution: On the evolution of  internal nostrils (choanae)]&lt;/ref&gt; and a brain with certain similarities to the [[lissamphibia]]n brain (except for the Queensland lungfish, which branched off in its own direction about 277 million years ago and has a brain resembling that of the ''[[Latimeria]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113898 The First Virtual Cranial Endocast of a Lungfish (Sarcopterygii: Dipnoi)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The dentition of lungfish is different from that of any other [[vertebrate]] group. "[[Odontode]]s" on the palate and lower jaws develop in a series of rows to form a fan-shaped [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]] surface.  These odontodes then wear to form a uniform crushing surface.  In several groups, including the modern [[lepidosireniformes]], these ridges have been modified to form occluding blades.

The modern lungfishes have a number of larval features, which suggest [[paedomorphosis]]. They also demonstrate the largest [[genome]] among the vertebrates.

Modern lungfish all have an elongate body with fleshy, paired [[pectoral fin|pectoral]] and [[pelvic fin]]s and a single unpaired caudal fin replacing the dorsal, caudal and anal fins of most fishes.

==Lungs==
[[Image:Lungs of Protopterus dolloi.JPG|thumb|right|300 px|Lateral view of lungs of a dissected [[spotted lungfish]] (''Protopterus dolloi'')]]

Lungfish have a highly specialized [[respiratory system]].  They have a distinct feature that their lungs are connected to the larynx and pharynx without a trachea.  While other species of fish can breathe air using modified, vascularized [[gas bladder]]s,&lt;ref name=farmer&gt;{{citation|title=Did lungs and the intracardiac shunt evolve to oxygenate the heart in vertebrates|author=Colleen Farmer|journal=Paleobiology|year=1997|url=http://www.biology.utah.edu/farmer/publications%20pdf/1997%20Paleobiology23.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611170942/http://www.biology.utah.edu/farmer/publications%20pdf/1997%20Paleobiology23.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; these bladders are usually simple sacs, devoid of complex internal structure.  In contrast, the lungs of lungfish are subdivided into numerous smaller air sacs, maximizing the surface area available for gas exchange.

Most extant lungfish species have two lungs, with the exception of the Australian lungfish, which only has one.  The lungs of lungfish are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to the lungs of [[tetrapod]]s. As in tetrapods and [[bichir]]s, the lungs extend from the ventral surface of the [[esophagus]] and gut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cwx.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/martini10/chapter24/custom2/deluxe-content.html Chapter 24: The Respiratory System Evolution Atlas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125095303/http://cwx.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/martini10/chapter24/custom2/deluxe-content.html |date=2010-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.biology.ufl.edu/sahilber/VertZooLab2007/Lab2.htm LAB 2 - GNATHOSTOME FORM &amp; FUNCTION]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfusion of water===
Of extant lungfish, only the [[Australian lungfish]] can respire through its gills. In other species, the gills are too atrophied to allow for adequate [[gas exchange]]. When a lungfish is obtaining [[oxygen]] from its gills, its circulatory system is configured similarly to the common fish. The spiral valve of the [[conus arteriosus]] is open, the bypass arterioles of the third and fourth gill arches (which do not actually have gills) are shut, the second, fifth and sixth gill arch arterioles are open, the [[ductus arteriosus]] branching off the sixth arteriole is open, and the pulmonary arteries are closed. As the water passes through the gills, the lungfish uses a buccal pump. Flow through the mouth and gills is unidirectional. Blood flow through the secondary lamellae is countercurrent to the water, maintaining a more constant concentration gradient.

===Perfusion of air===
When breathing air, the spiral valve of the conus arteriosus closes (minimizing the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood), the third and fourth gill arches open, the second and fifth gill arches close (minimizing the possible loss of the oxygen obtained in the lungs through the gills), the sixth arteriole's ductus arteriosus is closed, and the pulmonary arteries open. Importantly, during air breathing, the sixth gill is still used in respiration; deoxygenated blood loses some of its carbon dioxide as it passes though the gill before reaching the lung. This is because carbon dioxide is more soluble in water. Air flow through the mouth is tidal, and through the lungs it is bidirectional and observes "uniform pool" diffusion of oxygen.

==Ecology and life history==
Lungfish are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]], feeding on fish, [[insect]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[worm]]s, [[mollusk]]s, [[amphibian]]s and plant matter. They have an [[intestinal spiral valve]] rather than a true [[stomach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ar.1091820109 | volume=182 | title=Electron microscopy of the intestine of the african lungfish,Protopterus aethiopicus | year=1975 | journal=The Anatomical Record | pages=71–89 | author=Purkerson M. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African and South American lungfish are capable of surviving seasonal drying out of their habitats by burrowing into mud and [[estivation|estivating]] throughout the dry season.  Changes in [[physiology]] allow it to slow its [[metabolism]] to as little as 1/60th of the normal metabolic rate, and protein waste is converted from [[ammonia]] to less-toxic [[urea]] (normally, lungfish excrete nitrogenous waste as ammonia directly into the water).

Burrowing is seen in at least one group of fossil lungfish, the [[Gnathorhizidae]].

Lungfish can be extremely long-lived.  A [[Queensland lungfish]] at the [[Shedd Aquarium]] in [[Chicago]] was part of the permanent live collection from 1933 to 2017, when it was euthanized following a decline in health consistent with old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/chicago-aquarium-euthanizes-more-than-90-year-old-lungfish/412918113/|title=Chicago aquarium euthanizes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively little is known about the South American lungfish,&lt;ref name="Ernst Heinrich Philipp August Haeckel, Edwin Ray Lankester, L.

South American lungfishes also share an autostylic jaw suspension (where the [[palatoquadrate]] is fused to the [[cranium]]) and powerful adductor jaw muscles with the extant lungfish (Dipnoi). Like the [[African lungfish]]es, this species has an elongate, almost eel-like body. It may reach a length of {{convert|125|cm|ft}}. The [[pectoral fin]]s are thin and threadlike, while the pelvic fins are somewhat larger, and set far back.

The relationship of lungfishes to the rest of the [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] is well understood:
* Lungfishes are most closely related to ''[[Powichthys]]'', and then to the [[Porolepiformes]].
* Together, these taxa form the [[Dipnomorpha]], the sister group to the [[Tetrapodomorpha]].
* Together, these form the [[Rhipidistia]], the sister group to the [[Coelacanth]]s.

Recent molecular genetic analyses strongly support a sister relationship of lungfishes and tetrapods ([[Rhipidistia]]), with Coelacanths branching slightly earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The African coelacanth genome provides insights into tetrapod evolution | journal = Nature | date = 18 April 2013 | doi = 10.1038/nature12027 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v496/n7445/pdf/nature12027.pdf | accessdate = 2013-04-20 | pmid=23598338 | volume=496 | issue=7445 | pmc=3633110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takezaki, N. and Nishihara, H. (2017) Support for Lungfish as the Closest Relative of Tetrapods by Using Slowly Evolving Ray-Finned Fish as the Outgroup. ''Genome Biology and Evolution'', '''9''' (1): 93-101. {{doi|10.1093/gbe/evw288}} {{PMID|28082606}} [https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article-pdf/9/1/93/10240840/evw288.pdf PDF fulltext].&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationships among lungfishes are significantly more difficult to resolve.  While Devonian lungfish had enough bone in the skull to determine relationships, post-Devonian lungfish are represented entirely by skull roofs and teeth, as the rest of the skull is [[cartilage|cartilaginous]].  Additionally, many of the taxa already identified may not be [[monophyletic]].

Current phylogenetic studies support the following relationships of major lungfish taxa: Class Osteichthyes, subclass Sarcopterygii, order Dipnoi.

'''Auguste of Baden-Baden''' (Auguste Marie Johanna; 10 November 1704 &amp;ndash; 8 August 1726) was born a member of the ruling family of [[Margraviate of Baden|Baden-Baden]] and was later the [[Duchess of Orléans]] by marriage to [[Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans]]. Her husband was a grandson of her father's former enemy, [[Louis XIV of France]]. Known in France as ''Auguste de Bade'', she died in childbirth. She is an ancestor of [[Louis Philippe I]] and of several members of royal families of Europe, such as the Spanish and Italian royal families, as well as the present Grand Duke of Luxemburg.

==Infancy==

Auguste was born in [[Aschaffenburg]] as the ninth child of the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] army commander [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden]], and of his wife Princess [[Duchess Sibylle of Saxe-Lauenburg|Sibylle of Saxe-Lauenburg]], who was twenty years younger than her husband. After her father's death in 1707, her mother Sibylle became regent of the Margraviate for Auguste's brother, [[Louis George, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Louis George]].

Her mother was a great patron of the arts, making Baden-Baden a centre of architectural culture. Between the years of her mother's Regency (1707–1727) Sibylle  ordered the construction of some four palaces in the state as well as two churches. Auguste saw the construction of the [[Schloss Favorite (Rastatt)|Schloss Favorite]] in [[Rastatt]].

Her aunt [[Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg]] was the [[Grand Duchess of Tuscany]] as wife of [[Gian Gastone de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Gian Gastone de' Medici]], her husbands own distant cousin. The Italian born [[Louis Victor, Prince of Carignan|Prince of Carignan]] was also a distant cousin and was a resident at the French. Auguste was the youngest of nine children and was the only daughter to survive over the age of seven. She had one older brother, [[Louis George, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Louis George]] (1702–1761) the future Margrave of Baden-Baden and a younger one, [[Augustus George, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Augustus George]] who was Margrave of Baden-Baden from 1761&amp;ndash;1771 succeeding his brother.

==Duchess of Orléans==

As her mother was regent of Auguste's native Baden-Baden, it was her mother who tried to find a suitable candidate for her only daughter. Her mother proposed two candidates;&lt;ref name="schloss-rastatt.de"/&gt; [[Alexander Ferdinand, 3rd Prince of Thurn and Taxis|Prince Alexander Ferdinand of Thurn and Taxis]], son and heir of [[Anselm Franz, 2nd Prince of Thurn and Taxis|Anselm Franz of Thurn and Taxis]], a wealthy German noble of the powerful [[Thurn und Taxis]]&lt;ref name="schloss-rastatt.de"/&gt; family and the Postmaster General of the Holy Roman Empire. The second was a French [[prince du Sang|prince]], [[Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans]]. 
[[File:Portrait identified as Auguste of Baden-Baden as Duchess of Orléans by an unknown artist (possibly Pierre Gobert).png|left|200px|thumb|Portrait identified as Auguste as Duchess of Orléans by an unknown artist (possibly Pierre Gobert)]]
Her mother preferred the French match as it would strengthen ties with a powerful neighbour who prior to Auguste's birth, had ravaged Baden-Baden. Auguste however preferred the German match due to her roots.&lt;ref name="schloss-rastatt.de"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.schloss-rastatt.de/de/267824-html/Heiratspolitik/334018.html|title= Marriage policy of Sibylle of Saxe-Lauenburg, ''Schloss Rastatt'' |accessdate= 2010-07-01|last= |first= |work= schloss-rastatt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auguste, however gave into her mother and agreed to the match with Louis d'Orléans and there was a proxy ceremony held at the [[Schloss Rastatt]] before she was married on 13 July 1724 Louis d'Orléans, the grandson of [[Louis XIV of France]]. Chosen for, among other reasons, her family's Catholicism, she brought a comparatively small dowry of 80,000 [[French livre|livres]] to the Orléans.

At the court of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], she was known alternatively as ''Jeanne'' or ''Auguste de Bade'', it was as the latter which she signed.&lt;ref&gt;Dufresne, Claude, ''Les Orléans'', CRITERION, Paris, 1991, chapter: ''Un prince par trop dévot''.&lt;/ref&gt; Her marriage to the ''[[Prince du Sang|First Prince of the Blood]]'' allowed her to use the style of ''Madame la Princesse'', and made her one of the most important ladies at the court of the young [[Louis XV of France]]. At the time of her marriage, the young king Louis was "engaged" to his first cousin the [[Mariana Victoria of Spain|Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain]]. The couple were never actually married and in 1725 she was sent back to Spain then making Auguste and her mother in law the [[Françoise Marie de Bourbon|Dowager Duchess of Orléans]] the most senior women at court. She was popular with the court and noted as being very charming. In 1725, Louis XV married [[Marie Leszczyńska]], making Auguste one step behind the new queen in terms of rank and etiquette. She and her husband lived in the [[Château de Saint-Cloud]], one of the Orléans' residences, and had also an apartment at the château of Versailles where her son Louis Philippe was born in 1725.

Expecting to give birth to her second child at Versailles in early August 1726, her mother in law [[Françoise Marie de Bourbon|Dowager Duchess of Orléans]] forced her heavily pregnant daughter in law to return to Paris&lt;ref name="Jounal des regnes"/&gt; in order to have the child at the Palais-Royal. Leaving Versailles on 4 August, she had to stop at [[Sèvres]]&lt;ref name="Jounal des regnes"/&gt; due to the extremity of her labour pains. Despite the stop, she returned to Paris.&lt;ref name="Jounal des regnes"&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=y5ofAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA593&amp;dq=auguste+marie+jeanne+de+bade,+duchesse+d'orleans&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K-AgTOOoAcT7_Aa13JEL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=Journal des règnes de Louis XIV et Louis XV (1701-1744) |accessdate= 2010-04-21|last=|first= |work= Googlebooks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auguste died on 8 August 1726, at the age of twenty-two, three days after giving birth to the couple's second child at the [[Palais-Royal]], the Paris residence of the [[House of Orléans]]. Despite the shortness of the relationship, many contemporaries said that the couple was well matched and that they had fallen in love at first sight. After her death, her husband went into a long period of mourning. It was said of Auguste that ''she had all the great qualities of the heart, that she died with the universal regret of France''.&lt;ref name="Googlebooks"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yqU5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA432&amp;dq=jeanne+de+bade,+duchesse+d'orleans&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X9sgTISmNIKD_AaTh7Qd&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Le chateau d'eu: notices historiques, Volume 4|accessdate= 2010-03-25|last= Vatout|first= Jean |work= Googlebooks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was buried at the [[Val-de-Grâce]] Convent in Paris. After her death, her aunt by marriage [[Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans]]&lt;ref&gt;sister of the Regent&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that Louis marry one of her daughters namely [[Elisabeth Teresa of Lorraine|Élisabeth Thérèse of Lorraine]]&lt;ref&gt;later wife of [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia]] and Queen of Sardinia&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Princess Anne Charlotte of Lorraine|Anne Charlotte]]. Louis refused outright, much to the annoyance of his aunt.

==Issue==
#[[Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Louis Philippe d'Orléans]] (12 May 1725 &amp;ndash; 18 November 1785) married [[Louise Henriette de Bourbon]] and had children. 
#[[Louise Marie d'Orléans]] (5 August 1726 &amp;ndash; 14 May 1728) died in infancy.

In researching human [[disease]], model organisms allow for better understanding the disease process without the added risk of harming an actual human. The species chosen will usually meet a determined [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] equivalency to humans, so as to react to disease or its treatment in a way that resembles human [[physiology]] as needed. Although biological activity in a model organism does not ensure an effect in humans, many drugs, treatments and cures for human diseases are developed in part with the guidance of animal models.&lt;ref name="zam"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=Feb 2009|title=Zebrafish: a complete animal model for in vivo drug discovery and development|journal=[[Curr.

Homologous animals have the same causes, symptoms and treatment options as would humans who have the same disease. Isomorphic animals share the same symptoms and treatments. Predictive models are similar to a particular human disease in only a couple of aspects, but are useful in isolating and making predictions about mechanisms of a set of disease features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://academic.uprm.edu/~ephoebus/id85.htm | title=Pinel Chapter 6 - Human Brain Damage &amp; Animal Models | publisher=Academic.uprm.edu | date= | accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The use of animals in research dates back to [[ancient Greece]], with [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) and [[Erasistratus]] (304–258 BCE) among the first to perform experiments on living animals.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen BJ, Loew FM. (1984) Laboratory Animal Medicine: Historical Perspectives in Laboratory Animal Medicine Academic Press, Inc: Orlando, FL, USA; Fox JG, Cohen BJ, Loew FM (eds)&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries in the 18th and 19th centuries included [[Antoine Lavoisier]]'s use of a [[guinea pig]] in a [[calorimeter]] to prove that [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] was a form of combustion, and [[Louis Pasteur]]'s demonstration of the [[germ theory of disease]] in the 1880s using [[anthrax]] in sheep.

Research using animal models has been central to many of the achievements of modern medicine.&lt;ref name=RSM2015&gt;{{cite web| title = Statement of the Royal Society’s position on the use of animals in research| author = Royal Society of Medicine| date = 13 May 2015| url = https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/publications/2015/animals-in-research/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NRCIOM&gt;{{cite book|author=[[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] and [[Institute of Medicine]]|title=Use of Laboratory Animals in Biomedical and Behavioral Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzorAAAAYAAJ|date=1988|publisher=National Academies Press|page=37|id=NAP:13195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature2007"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lieschke GJ, Currie PD | title=Animal models of human disease: zebrafish swim into view. | journal=Nat Rev Genet | year= 2007 | volume= 8 | issue= 5 | pages= 353–67 | doi=10.1038/nrg2091 | pmc= | pmid=17440532}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has contributed most of the basic knowledge in fields such as human [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]], and has played significant roles in fields such as [[neuroscience]] and [[infectious disease]].&lt;ref name=NRCIOMb&gt;{{cite book|author=[[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] and [[Institute of Medicine]]|title=Use of Laboratory Animals in Biomedical and Behavioral Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzorAAAAYAAJ|date=1988|publisher=National Academies Press|page=27|id=NAP:13195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HLAS2011"&gt;Hau and Shapiro 2011:

In the late 19th century, [[Emil von Behring]] isolated the [[diphtheria]] toxin and demonstrated its effects in guinea pigs. He went on to develop an antitoxin against diphtheria in animals and then in humans, which resulted in the modern methods of immunization and largely ended diphtheria as a threatening disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1901/behring-bio.html Bering Nobel Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; The diphtheria antitoxin is famously commemorated in the Iditarod race, which is modeled after the delivery of antitoxin in the [[1925 serum run to Nome]]. The success of animal studies in producing the diphtheria antitoxin has also been attributed as a cause for the decline of the early 20th-century opposition to animal research in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amphilsoc.org/library/mole/c/cannon.htm Walter B.

Subsequent research in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as [[Frederick Banting]]'s research in dogs, which determined that the isolates of pancreatic secretion could be used to treat dogs with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. This led to the 1922 discovery of [[insulin]] (with [[John James Rickard Macleod|John Macleod]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mta.ca/faculty/arts/canadian_studies/english/about/study_guide/doctors/insulin.html Discovery of Insulin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930142937/http://www.mta.ca/faculty/arts/canadian_studies/english/about/study_guide/doctors/insulin.html |date=September 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlife.com/dLife/do/ShowContent/inspiration_expert_advice/famous_people/leonard_thompson.html Thompson bio ref] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210030429/http://www.dlife.com/dLife/do/ShowContent/inspiration_expert_advice/famous_people/leonard_thompson.html |date=2009-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Cade]]'s research in guinea pigs discovered the anticonvulsant properties of lithium salts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130374b.htm] John Cade and Lithium&lt;/ref&gt; which revolutionized the treatment of [[bipolar disorder]], replacing the previous treatments of lobotomy or electroconvulsive therapy. Modern general anaesthetics, such as [[halothane]] and related compounds, were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations.&lt;ref name="raventos1956"&gt;Raventos J (1956) ''Br J Pharmacol'' 11, 394&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whalen2005"&gt;Whalen FX, Bacon DR &amp; Smith HM (2005) ''Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol'' 19, 323&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection==
Models are those organisms with a wealth of biological data that make them attractive to study as examples for other [[species]] and/or natural phenomena that are more difficult to study directly. Continual research on these organisms focus on a wide variety of experimental techniques and goals from many different levels of biology—from [[ecology]], [[behavior]] and [[biomechanics]], down to the tiny functional scale of individual [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]], [[organelle]]s and [[protein]]s. Inquiries about the DNA of organisms are classed as [[Genetics|genetic]] models (with short generation times, such as the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruitfly]] and [[Caenorhabditis elegans|nematode]] worm), [[experimental]] models, and [[genomic]] parsimony models, investigating pivotal position in the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD020803.html What are model organisms?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028072001/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD020803.html |date=October 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, model organisms include a handful of species with extensive genomic research data, such as the NIH model organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/science/models/ NIH model organisms] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822041956/http://www.nih.gov/science/models/ |date=August 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, model organisms are chosen on the basis that they are amenable to experimental manipulation. This usually will include characteristics such as short [[Biological life cycle|life-cycle]], techniques for genetic manipulation ([[inbreeding|inbred]] strains, [[stem cell]] lines, and methods of [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]]) and non-specialist living requirements. Sometimes, the genome arrangement facilitates the sequencing of the model organism's genome, for example, by being very compact or having a low proportion of [[junk DNA]] (e.g. [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]], [[Arabidopsis thaliana|arabidopsis]], or [[Takifugu rubripes|pufferfish]]).

When researchers look for an organism to use in their studies, they look for several traits. Among these are size, generation time, accessibility, manipulation, genetics, conservation of mechanisms, and potential economic benefit. As comparative [[molecular biology]] has become more common, some researchers have sought model organisms from a wider assortment of [[Kinship and descent|lineages]] on the [[Tree of life (science)|tree of life]].

===Phylogeny and genetic relatedness===
The primary reason for the use of model organisms in research is the evolutionary principle that all organisms share some degree of relatedness and genetic similarity due to [[common ancestry]]. The study of taxonomic human relatives, then, can provide a great deal of information about mechanism and disease within the human body that can be useful in medicine.

Various phylogenetic trees for vertebrates have been constructed using comparative [[proteomics]], genetics, genomics as well as the geochemical and fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

As our closest relatives, chimpanzees have a lot of potential to tell us about mechanisms of disease (and what genes may be responsible for human intelligence). However, chimpanzees are rarely used in research and are protected from highly invasive procedures. The most common animal model is the rodent.

Scientists have been able to take advantage of these similarities in generating experimental and predictive models of human disease.

There are many model organisms. One of the first model systems for [[molecular biology]] was the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', a common constituent of the human digestive system. Several of the bacterial viruses ([[bacteriophage]]) that infect ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' also have been very useful for the study of gene structure and [[gene regulation]] (e.g. phages [[Lambda phage|Lambda]] and [[Enterobacteria phage T4|T4]]). However, it is debated whether bacteriophages should be classified as organisms, because they lack metabolism and depend on functions of the host cells for propagation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grada|first=Ayman|last2=Mervis|first2=Joshua|last3=Falanga|first3=Vincent|date=2018|title=Research Techniques Made Simple: Animal Models of Wound Healing|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30244718|journal=The Journal of Investigative Dermatology|volume=138|issue=10|pages=2095–2105.e1|doi=10.1016/j.jid.2018.08.005|issn=1523-1747|pmid=30244718|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[eukaryote]]s, several yeasts, particularly ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' ("baker's" or "budding" yeast), have been widely used in [[genetics]] and [[cell biology]], largely because they are quick and easy to grow. The [[cell cycle]] in a simple [[yeast]] is very similar to the cell cycle in [[human]]s and is regulated by [[homology (biology)|homologous]] proteins. The fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' is studied, again, because it is easy to grow for an animal, has various visible congenital traits and has a [[polytene]] (giant) chromosome in its salivary glands that can be examined under a light microscope. The [[roundworm]] ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' is studied because it has very defined development patterns involving fixed numbers of cells, and it can be rapidly assayed for abnormalities.

==Disease models==
Animal models serving in research may have an existing, inbred or induced [[disease]] or injury that is similar to a human condition. These test conditions are often termed as '''animal models of disease'''. The use of animal models allows researchers to investigate disease states in ways which would be inaccessible in a human patient, performing procedures on the non-human animal that imply a level of harm that would not be considered ethical to inflict on a human.

The best models of disease are similar in [[etiology]] (mechanism of cause) and phenotype (signs and symptoms) to the human equivalent. However complex human diseases can often be better understood in a simplified system in which individual parts of the disease process are isolated and examined. For instance, behavioral analogues of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] or [[pain]] in laboratory animals can be used to screen and test new [[medication|drugs]] for the treatment of these conditions in humans. A 2000 study found that animal models concorded (coincided on true positives and false negatives) with human toxicity in 71% of cases, with 63% for nonrodents alone and 43% for rodents alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Olson H, Betton G, Robinson D, etal | title=Concordance of the toxicity of pharmaceuticals in humans and in animals | journal=Regul.

In 1987, Davidson et al. suggested that selection of an animal model for research be based on nine considerations. These include "1) appropriateness as an analog, 2) transferability of information, 3) genetic uniformity of organisms, where applicable, 4) background knowledge of biological properties, 5) cost and availability, 6) generalizability of the results, 7) ease of and adaptability to experimental manipulation, 8) ecological consequences, and 9) ethical implications."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Spontaneous models refer to diseases that are analogous to human conditions that occur naturally in the animal being studied. These models are rare, but informative. Negative models essentially refer to control animals, which are useful for validating an experimental result. Orphan models refer to diseases for which there is no human analog and occur exclusively in the species studied.&lt;ref name="pmid750165"/&gt;

The increase in knowledge of the [[genome]]s of non-human [[primates]] and other [[mammals]] that are genetically close to humans is allowing the production of [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] animal tissues, organs and even animal species which express human diseases, providing a more robust model of human diseases in an animal model.

Animal models observed in the sciences of [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] are often termed '''animal models of behavior'''. It is difficult to build an animal model that perfectly reproduces the [[symptom]]s of depression in patients. Depression, as other [[mental disorders]], consists of [[endophenotype]]s&lt;ref name=endophenotype&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hasler | first1=G. | year=2004 | title=Discovering endophenotypes for major depression | journal=Neuropsychopharmacology | volume=29 | issue=10 | pages=1765–1781 | doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300506}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be reproduced independently and evaluated in animals. An ideal animal model offers an opportunity to understand [[molecular]], [[genetics|genetic]] and [[epigenetic]] factors that may lead to depression. By using animal models, the underlying molecular alterations and the causal relationship between [[Heredity|genetic]] or environmental alterations and depression can be examined, which would afford a better insight into [[pathology]] of depression. In addition, [[animal models of depression]] are indispensable for identifying novel [[therapies]] for depression.{{citation needed | date=September 2011}}

==Important model organisms==
{{see also | List of model organisms}}

Model organisms are drawn from all three [[Domain (biology)|domains]] of life, as well as [[virus]]es. The most widely studied [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] model organism is ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli''), which has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. It is a common, [[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]] gut bacterium which can be grown and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting. It is the most widely used organism in [[molecular genetics]], and is an important species in the fields of [[biotechnology]] and [[microbiology]], where it has served as the [[host organism]] for the majority of work with [[recombinant DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bacteria | url=http://www.microbiologyonline.org.uk/about-microbiology/introducing-microbes/bacteria | publisher=Microbiologyonline | accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple model [[eukaryote]]s include baker's yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') and fission yeast (''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]''), both of which share many characters with higher cells, including those of humans. For instance, many [[cell division]] genes that are critical for the development of [[cancer]] have been discovered in yeast. ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'', a unicellular [[green alga]] with well-studied genetics, is used to study [[photosynthesis]] and [[motility]]. ''C. reinhardtii'' has many known and mapped mutants and expressed sequence tags, and there are advanced methods for genetic transformation and selection of genes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.jgi-psf.org/chlamy Chlamydomonas reinhardtii resources at the Joint Genome Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'' is used in [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]], and is studied as an example of [[cell communication]], [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], and [[programmed cell death]].

Among invertebrates, the [[Drosophilidae|fruit fly]] ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' is famous as the subject of genetics experiments by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and others.

===Selected model organisms===

The organisms below have become model organisms because they facilitate the study of certain characters or because of their genetic accessibility. For example, [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] was one of the first organisms for which genetic techniques such as [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] or [[Genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]] has been developed.

The [[genome]]s of all model species have been [[genome sequencing project|sequenced]], including their [[mitochondria]]l/[[chloroplast]] genomes. [[Model organism databases]] exist to provide researchers with a portal from which to download sequences (DNA, RNA, or protein) or to access functional information on specific genes, for example the sub-cellular localization of the gene product or its physiological role.

==Limitations==
Many animal models serving as test subjects in biomedical research, such as rats and mice, may be selectively [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]], [[obese]] and [[glucose intolerance|glucose intolerant]]. This may confound their use to model human metabolic processes and diseases as these can be affected by dietary energy intake and [[exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martin B, Ji S, Maudsley S, Mattson MP | year=2010 | title="Control" laboratory rodents are metabolically morbid: Why it matters | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=107 | pages=6127–6133 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0912955107 | pmid=20194732 | issue=14 | pmc=2852022| bibcode=2010PNAS..107.6127M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there are differences between the immune systems of model organisms and humans that lead to significantly altered responses to stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mestas|first=Javier|last2=Hughes|first2=Christopher C.

=== Unintended bias ===
Some studies suggests that inadequate published data in animal testing may result in irreproducible research, with missing details about how experiments are done omitted from published papers or differences in testing that may introduce bias. Examples of hidden bias include a 2014 study from [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Canada]] which suggests that mice handled by men rather than women showed higher stress levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21712058-evolution-scientific-mainstay-worlds-favourite-lab-animal-has-been-found|title=The world’s favourite lab animal has been found wanting, but there are new twists in the mouse’s tale|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katsnelson|first=Alla|title=Male researchers stress out rodents|url=http://www.nature.com/news/male-researchers-stress-out-rodents-1.15106|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15106|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/04/male-scent-may-compromise-biomedical-research|title=Male Scent May Compromise Biomedical Research|date=2014-04-28|newspaper=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in 2016 suggested that gut [[Microbiota|microbiomes]] in mice may have an impact upon scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/mouse-microbes-may-make-scientific-studies-harder-replicate|title=Mouse microbes may make scientific studies harder to replicate|date=2016-08-15|newspaper=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives===

Ethical concerns, as well as the cost, maintenance and relative inefficiency of animal research has encouraged development of alternative methods for the study of disease. Cell culture, or ''in vitro'' studies, provide an alternative that preserves the physiology of the living cell, but does not require the sacrifice of an animal for mechanistic studies. Human, inducible pluripotent stem cells can also elucidate new mechanisms for understanding cancer and cell regeneration. Imaging studies (such as MRI or PET scans) enable non-invasive study of human subjects. Recent advances in genetics and genomics can identify disease-associated genes, which can be targeted for therapies. 
 
Ultimately, however, there is no substitute for a living organism when studying complex interactions in disease pathology or treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FDA: Why are animals used for testing medical products? | url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm194932.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Society Of Toxicology: Advancing valid alternatives | url=http://www.toxicology.org/ms/air4.asp| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105120605/http://www.toxicology.org/ms/air4.asp| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==

Debate about the ethical use of animals in research dates at least as far back as 1822 when the British Parliament enacted the first law for animal protection preventing cruelty to cattle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061214034848/http://homepage.tinet.ie/~pnowlan/Chapter-77.htm British animal protection legislation].&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1835 and 1849, which criminalized ill-treating, over-driving, and torturing animals. In 1876, under pressure from the [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]], the Cruelty to Animals Act was amended to include regulations governing the use of animals in research. This new act stipulated that 1) experiments must be proven absolutely necessary for instruction, or to save or prolong human life; 2) animals must be properly anesthetized; and 3) animals must be killed as soon as the experiment is over. Today, these three principles are central to the laws and guidelines governing the use of animals and research. In the U.S., the Animal Welfare Act of 1970 (see also [[Laboratory Animal Welfare Act]]) set standards for animal use and care in research. This law is enforced by APHIS’s Animal Care program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awic.nal.usda.gov/government-and-professional-resources/federal-laws/animal-welfare-act AWA policies].&lt;/ref&gt;

In academic settings in which NIH funding is used for animal research, institutions are governed by the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW). At each site, OLAW guidelines and standards are upheld by a local review board called the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All laboratory experiments involving living animals are reviewed and approved by this committee. In addition to proving the potential for benefit to human health, minimization of pain and distress, and timely and humane euthanasia, experimenters must justify their protocols based on the principles of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/investigatorsneed2know.pdf NIH need-to-know]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Replacement''' refers to efforts to engage alternatives to animal use. This includes the use of computer models, non-living tissues and cells, and replacement of “higher-order” animals (primates and mammals) with “lower” order animals (e.g. cold-blooded animals, invertebrates, bacteria) wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000815070936/http://www.nih.gov/science/models/ list of common model organisms approved for use by the NIH])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reduction''' refers to efforts to minimize number of animals used during the course of an experiment, as well as prevention of unnecessary replication of previous experiments. To satisfy this requirement, mathematical calculations of statistical power are employed to determine the minimum number of animals that can be used to get a statistically significant experimental result.

'''Refinement''' refers to efforts to make experimental design as painless and efficient as possible in order to minimize the suffering of each animal subject.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by the Small Spacecraft Division at [[NASA Ames Research Center]], the spacecraft was successfully launched as a secondary payload on [[STP-S26]] led by the [[Space Test Program]] of the [[United States Air Force]] on a [[Minotaur IV]] rocket from [[Kodiak Island]], [[Alaska]] on November 19, 2010.

== Mission overview ==
The O/OREOS satellite is [[NASA]]'s first [[cubesat]] to demonstrate the capability to have two distinct, completely independent science experiments on an autonomous satellite. One experiment will test how [[microorganisms]] survive and adapt to the stresses of space; the other will monitor the stability of organic molecules in space.

The overall goal of the O/OREOS mission is to demonstrate the capability to do low-cost science experiments on autonomous nanosatellites in space in support of the 'Astrobiology Small Payloads' program under the Planetary Science Division of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA's Headquarters. NASA's Ames Small Spacecraft Division manages the O/OREOS mission while all operations will be conducted by staff and students from the Robotic Systems Laboratory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsl.engr.scu.edu|title=rsl.engr.scu.edu&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Santa Clara University]]. Scientists will apply the knowledge they gain while investigating the [[space environment]] and studying how exposure to space changes [[organism]]s to help to answer [[astrobiology]]'s fundamental questions on the [[Abiogenesis|origin]], [[evolution]], and distribution of [[life]].

The technology developed in this mission enables a new generation of light-weight, low-cost payloads suitable for future secondary payload opportunities —"piggyback rides"— to the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], and beyond, where they can address evolutionary questions, identify human exploration risks, and study [[planetary protection]] concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://microsatellitefreeflyer.arc.nasa.gov/docs/OOREOS_Overview.pdf |title=O/OREOS Overview|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/090508-am-oreos-experiment.html|title= Earth Life to Get Space Stress Test}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spacecraft overview ==
Continuing Ames' development of triple-cube nanosatellite technology and flight systems, which includes the successful GeneSat-1 and [[PharmaSat]] missions, O/OREOS is constructed from off-the-shelf commercial and NASA-designed parts to create a fully self-contained, automated, stable, light-weight space science laboratory with innovative environment and power-control techniques. The spacecraft is equipped with sensors to monitor the levels of internal pressure, temperature, humidity, radiation and acceleration while its communications system regularly transmits data back to Earth for scientific analysis.

The organics payload will house 24 samples in four separate micro-environments to mimic space, lunar, Martian and "wet" planetary conditions. The samples are housed in a rotating carousel and are imaged regularly with UV/VIS spectroscopic instrumentation while being exposed to the space environment.

The biological payload is a self-contained pressure vessel which provides life support (air pressure, humidity, growth media, and temperature control) for [[organism]]s as they are exposed to the radiation and weightless conditions in space for six months.

In addition to the experiments, the satellite is equipped with a passive magnetic attitude control system, [[solar panel]]s to generate electric power, a [[UHF]] [[Amateur radio frequency allocations|amateur band radio]] beacon which broadcasts real-time telemetry, battery packs, and NASA's first propellant-less mechanism to ensure that once O/OREOS has completed its mission it will de-orbit and burn up as it re-enters Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name='Outer Space Oreos'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/3117/outer-space-oreos| title=Outer Space Oreos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary experiments ==
The goals of the O/OREOS mission include:&lt;ref name='Bramall'/&gt;
*demonstrating key small satellite technologies that can enable future low-cost astrobiology experiment.
*deploying a miniature UV/VIS/[[Near-infrared spectroscopy|NIR]] spectrometer suitable for ''in-situ'' astrobiology and other scientific investigations.
*testing the capability to establish a variety of experimental reaction conditions to enable the study of astrobiological processes on small satellites.
*measuring the chemical evolution of organic molecules in LEO under conditions that can be extrapolated to interstellar and planetary environments.

=== Space Environment Survivability of Live Organisms ===
The O/OREOS Space Environment Survivability of Live Organisms (SESLO) experiment will characterize the growth, activity, health and ability of microorganisms to adapt to the stresses of the space environment. The experiment is sealed in a vessel at one atmosphere and contains two types of [[bacteria]] commonly found in salt ponds and soil: ''[[Halorubrum chaoviatoris]]'',  which thrives in the sort of [[brine|briny water]] that may exist below the surface of Mars or on Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', which holds the record for surviving in space for the longest duration (6 years on a NASA satellite).&lt;ref name='Outer Space Oreos'/&gt;{{nonspecific|date=August 2013}} The bacteria were launched as dried [[spore]]s and revived at different times during the mission with a nutrient-filled fluid a few days, three months and six months after launch.

Once the satellite is in orbit, the bacteria are constantly being exposed to [[low Earth orbit]] radiation while floating in micro-gravity. The SESLO experiment measures the microbes' population density. There was an expected change in color as dyed liquid nutrients were consumed and metabolized by the microorganisms. This color change is used to determine the effects of the combined exposure to space radiation and [[microgravity]] on organism growth, health, and survival when compared to a ground-based control experiment.

====Results====
The SESLO experiment measured the long-term survival, germination, and growth responses, including metabolic activity.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Space Environment Viability of Organics ===
The O/OREOS Space Environment Viability of Organics (SEVO) experiment will monitor the stability and changes in four classes [[organic matter]] as they are exposed to space conditions. Scientists selected the organic samples to represent some building blocks of life and abundant [[Aromaticity|aromatic molecules]], they think are distributed throughout the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

The controlled environments in the SEVO reaction cells do not accurately represent natural environments; rather, they are used to establish a set of initial conditions for the chemical reactants involved in photochemical experiments. These reactants were chosen because they can be related to fundamental processes believed to occur in planetary surface environments, comets, and the [[interstellar medium]]. As such, each of the different cell types was carefully chosen to simulate important aspects of astrobiologically relevant environments.

Four classes of [[organic compound]]s, namely an [[amino acid]], a [[quinone]], a
[[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] (PAH) and a metallo-[[porphyrin]] are being studied.&lt;ref name='Bramall'/&gt; The compounds were placed in four different micro-environments that simulate some conditions in interplanetary space, on the Moon, on Mars and in the outer Solar System. The experiment continuously exposes the organic matter to radiation in the form of solar [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light, [[visible light]], trapped-particle and [[cosmic radiation]] over six months in space. Scientists will determine the stability of the organic matter by studying ''in-situ'' the changes in UV, visible and near-infrared light absorption through daily measurements. 
The survival rate of these molecules will help determine whether some of Earth's [[biochemistry]] might have been performed in space and later delivered by [[meteorite]]s. The data may also help in deciding which molecules are good [[biomarkers]] that can signal the existence of past or present life on another world.&lt;ref name='Outer Space Oreos'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20120016528 SEVO (Space Environment Viability of Organics) Preliminary Results from Orbit]. (July 13, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Results====
Spectra from the PAH thin film in a water-vapor-containing microenvironment indicate measurable change due to solar irradiation in orbit, while three other nominally water-free microenvironments show no appreciable change. The quinone anthrarufin showed high photostability and no significant spectroscopically measurable change in any of the four microenvironments during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amateur satellite tracking ==
O/OREOS is equipped with an [[amateur radio]] beacon which operates at 437.305&amp;nbsp;MHz. HAM radio operators can decode the satellite's AX.25 packets and submit them to NASA via the beacon processing website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ooreos.org/|title=ooreos.org/&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission status==
In the fall of 2011, nearly 100,000 beacon packets have been submitted by amateurs in 20 countries. About 6 MB of data have been downlinked and processed by the Santa Clara University operation team through S-band (WiFi) bidirectional radio. In addition to the science results from both payloads, these data include measurements of the radiation dose, rotation data, temperature, and health status of the spacecraft. Multiple commands were uplinked successfully to tune operational parameters.&lt;ref name='status 2011'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/o/ooreos | title = O/OREOS (Organism/ORganics Exposure to Orbital Stresses) Nanosatellite | accessdate = 2013-07-18 | year = 2011 | work = Earth Observation Resources | publisher = [[ESA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three biological experiments using the SESLO payload are complete; they were executed on December 3, 2010, February 18 and May 19, 2011. From the SEVO experiment, the project observed nominal [[spectrometer]] function, and so far 24 sets of 24 UV-visible spectra have been recorded and downlinked, amounting to nearly 600 spectra from 4 organic sample types embedded in 4 microenvironments.&lt;ref name='status 2011'/&gt;

'''Poo-Chi''' (or Poochi, Poochie), one of the first generations of robopet toys, is a [[robot dog]] designed by Samuel James Lloyd and Matt Lucas, manufactured by Sega Toys, and distributed by [[Tiger Toys]].&lt;ref name="elecpets" /&gt;  Poo-Chi was released in 2000 and discontinued in 2002.

== History ==
Sega Toys' Poo-Chi hit markets on 1 April 2000, with [[Hasbro]]'s [[Tiger Electronics]] distributing the toy in all countries other than [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]. Retailing at a price of 3,980 yen (then the equivalent of $38 USD) in Japan and $24.99 in the [[United States]], the toy offered significantly cheaper competition to the [[Sony AIBO|AIBO]]'s prices of up to 250,000 yen (then $2,400 USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Puppy love | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=19 January 2000 | agency=[[Associated Press]] | author=Inouye, Itsuo | pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/679642.stm | title=Robofish splash down in Tokyo | work=[[BBC News]] | date=16 March 2000 | accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leadsalespr"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.mimitchi.com/html/furbn147.htm | title=Poo-Chi Leads the Pack in Holiday Toy Sales | publisher=Business Wire | date=12 December 2000 | accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Hasbro's sales in their leading [[Furby]] line were slowing since its initial release in 1998 and sales of [[Star Wars]] branded merchandise was in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Slow sales cause Hasbro second-quarter earnings to fall 80 percent | work=Associated Press | date=20 July 2000 | location=Pawtucket, RI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Poo-Chi's release was a success, selling over 10 million units worldwide over the span of 8 months since its initial debut.&lt;ref name="leadsalespr" /&gt;

Special editions of the Poo-Chi soon sprouted, such as the ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'' holiday release of three Poo-Chis resembling the characters Domino, Little Dipper, and Oddball.&lt;ref name="leadsalespr" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cdn.media.ir.thewaltdisneycompany.com/2000/annual/ar_2000.pdf | title=The Walt Disney Company Annual Report 2000 | publisher=[[Walt Disney Company]] | accessdate=15 November 2013 | pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to special editions, an upgraded version, the Super Poo-Chi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sony hopes for success with new robotic pet | work=Bangor Daily News | date=13 October 2000 | agency=Associated Press | author=Kageyama, Yuri | pages=A9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and differing [[Dog breed|breed]]s of the Poo-Chi were released (all of which could communicate together), along with spin-offs such as the Meow-Chi and the Chirpy-Chi.&lt;ref name="leadsalespr" /&gt; Miniature versions were featured as toys in the [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.promoduck.com/PressRelease/html/press_con01a038.htm | title=Tiger Robo-Chi Pets™ Arrive at McDonald's February 23 Happy Meal Event to Feature Newest Cyber-Pal, Chirpy-Chi | date=20 February 2001 | accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poo-Chi stopped selling in 2002, having been replaced by [[FurReal Friends]].

==Description==
The original Poo-Chi had a gray body with ears, tail, and leg joints of either purple, blue, pink or green colour. With four legs allowing the toy to stand up or lie down, it utilized a red [[LED]] display as eyes to show [[emotion]].&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.robotsandcomputers.com/robots/manuals/Poo-Chi.pdf | title=Poo-Chi Instruction Manual | publisher=Tiger Electronics | accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oldrobots"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theoldrobots.com/smallbot34.html | title=Pio-Chi Robot Dog by Tiger Electronics Ltd - The Old Robots Web Site | publisher=The Old Robots Web Site | accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Editions===
The Christmas Special Edition Poo-Chi was offered for a limited time, coloured red and white with snowflake designs throughout the body, ears, with an interactive bone included in its seasonal box. The toy had its list of songs updated to include Christmas music. The Christmas Special Edition was only available in a handful of countries and retailed for 2–3 months, making it the rarest and most collectible of the genre with collectors realizing in excess of $300 USD for boxed Christmas Poo-Chi units.

===Speech===
Poo-Chi spoke using prerecorded sounds such as barks, whines, and growls. Due to limitations of the toy's technology, most of the sounds were rendered as beeps rather than a realistic sound effect. Poo-Chi could also "bark" songs, which could be prompted by pressing the button on the top of its head.

===Spin-offs===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Multiple spin-offs of the Poo-Chi were produced. All were based on different animals, other than the Super Poo-Chi, a larger version of the original toy.

* Meow-Chi - a robotic [[cat]].
* Super Poo-Chi - a larger version of the original toy.
* Dino-Chi - a robotic [[dinosaur]], with two types produced: the Dino-Chi [[Tyrannosaurus|T. Rex]] and the Dino-Chi [[Pterodactylus|Pterodactyl]].
* Chirpy-Chi - a robotic [[bird]].
* Petal-Chi - a robotic [[flower]] or [[plant]].
* Baby-chi - a robotic [[baby]].
* Botster - a regular robot.

===Songs===
The Poo-Chi could "sing" one of 6 songs when following the light sensor in its nose being activated, the touch sensor on its head was pressed. The toy would then emit a series of high-pitched beeps. The user could afterwards press the touch sensor, the number of times the sensor having been pressed corresponding to a different tune. The different songs the Poo-Chi could play are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Number of sensor presses
! Song title
|-
| 1
| [[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|The Wedding March]]
|-
| 2
| Camptown Races
|-
| 3
| Bingo
|-
| 4
| I've Been Working on the Railroad/Home On the Range
|-
| 5
| Beethoven No.9                              
|-
| 6
| When the Saints Come Marching In
|}

Poo-Chi would often sing "[[Ode to Joy]]" by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] when happy, and if another Poo-Chi or Robo-Chi pet was nearby (such as a Meow-Chi), that other Robo-Chi would begin to sing "Ode to Joy" as well, though the playback would not be synchronized.

'''Prejudice''', or '''bigotry''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=English Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=123|year=1855|issue=8|pages=113-116}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an affective feeling towards a person or group member based solely on that person's group membership (tribal behavior). The word is often used to refer to preconceived, usually unfavorable, feelings towards people or a person because of their [[sex]], [[gender]], [[belief]]s, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[social class]], [[Ageing|age]], [[disability]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[Race (human classification)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], [[language]], [[nationality]], [[beauty]], [[job|occupation]], [[education]], [[criminality]], [[Fan loyalty|sport team affiliation]] or other personal characteristics. In this case, it refers to a positive or negative evaluation of another person based on that person's perceived group membership.&lt;ref&gt;Dovidio, J. F., &amp; Gaertner. S. L. (2010). "Intergroup bias". In S. T. Fiske, D. T. Gilbert, &amp; G. Lindzey (Eds.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pye5IkCFgRYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Prejudice&amp;f=false The Handbook of Social Psychology]'' (5th ed., Vol. 2). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prejudice can also refer to unfounded or [[pigeonholed]] beliefs&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, Elliot. "[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0165025407083670 Commentary: The problems of prejudice, discrimination, and exclusion]." International Journal of Behavioral Development 31.5 (2007): 419-422.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William James]] wrote: "A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices." [http://www.freemaninstitute.com/quotes.htm Quotable Quotes – Courtesy of The Freeman Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; and it may include "any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosnow |first1=Ralph L. |title=Poultry and Prejudice |journal=Psychologist Today |date=March 1972 |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=53–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] defined prejudice as a "feeling, favorable or unfavorable, toward a person or thing, prior to, or not based on, actual experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allport|first=Gordon|title=The Nature of Prejudice|year=1979|publisher=Perseus Books Publishing|isbn=0-201-00179-9|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the evolutionary psychology perspective, see [[Prejudice from an evolutionary perspective]]. [[Lene_Auestad|Auestad]] (2015) defines prejudice as characterized by 'symbolic transfer', transfer of a value-laden meaning content onto a socially formed category and then on to individuals who are taken to belong to that category, resistance to change, and overgeneralization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auestad|first1=Lene|title=Respect, Plurality, and Prejudice|date=2015|publisher=Karnac|location=London|isbn=9781782201397|pages=xxi–xxii|edition=1|url=http://www.karnacbooks.com/product/respect-plurality-and-prejudice-a-psychoanalytical-and-philosophical-enquiry-into-the-dynamics-of-social-exclusion-and-discrimination/35283/?MATCH=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical approaches==
The first [[psychological research]] conducted on prejudice occurred in the 1920s. This research attempted to prove [[white supremacy]]. One article from 1925 which reviewed 73 studies on race concluded that the studies seemed "to indicate the mental superiority of the white race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0075064 |title=A review of race psychology |year=1930 |last1=Garth |first1=T. Rooster. |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=329–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies, along with other research, led many psychologists to view prejudice as a natural response to inferior races.

In the 1930s and 1940s, this perspective began to change due to the increasing concern about [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]]. At the time, theorists viewed prejudice as pathological and they thus looked for personality syndromes linked with [[racism]]. [[Theodor Adorno]] believed that prejudice stemmed from an [[authoritarian personality]]; he believed that people with authoritarian personalities were the most likely to be prejudiced against groups of lower status. He described authoritarians as "rigid thinkers who obeyed authority, saw the world as [[black and white thinking|black and white]], and enforced strict adherence to social rules and hierarchies".&lt;ref name="Plous, S 2011"&gt;Plous, S. "[http://www.understandingprejudice.org/apa/english/ The Psychology of Prejudice]". Understanding Prejudice.org. Web. 07 Apr. 2011.{{vs|where's the URL?|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, [[Gordon Allport]], in his classic work ''[[The Nature of Prejudice]]'', linked prejudice to categorical thinking. Allport claimed that prejudice is a natural and normal process for humans. According to him, "The human mind must think with the aid of categories… Once formed, categories are the basis for normal prejudgment. We cannot possibly avoid this process. Orderly living depends upon it."&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). ''The Nature of Prejudice''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, research began to show that prejudice tends to be based on [[In-group favoritism|favoritism towards one's own groups]], rather than negative feelings towards another group. According to [[Marilyn Brewer]], prejudice "may develop not because [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroups]] are hated, but because positive emotions such as admiration, sympathy, and trust are reserved for the ingroup."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00126 |title=The Psychology of Prejudice: Ingroup Love and Outgroup Hate? |year=1999 |last1=Brewer |first1=Marilynn B. |journal=[[Journal of Social Issues]] |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=429–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Thomas Pettigrew]] described the [[ultimate attribution error]] and its role in prejudice. The ultimate attribution error occurs when ingroup members "(1) attribute negative outgroup behavior to dispositional causes (more than they would for identical ingroup behavior), and (2) attribute positive outgroup behavior to one or more of the following causes: (a) a fluke or exceptional case, (b) luck or special advantage, (c) high motivation and effort, and (d) situational factors."&lt;ref name="Plous, S 2011"/&gt;

[[Elisabeth_Young-Bruehl|Youeng-Bruehl]] (1996) argued that prejudice cannot be treated in the singular; one should rather speak of different prejudices as characteristic of different character types. Her theory defines prejudices as being social defences, distinguishing between an obsessional character structure, primarily linked with anti-semitism, hysterical characters, primarily associated with racism, and narcissistic characters, linked with sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young-Bruehl|first1=Elizabeth|title=An Anatomy of Prejudices|date=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780674031913|page=38|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674031913&amp;content=reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary theories and empirical findings==

The [[out-group homogeneity]] effect is the perception that members of an out-group are more similar (homogenous) than members of the in-group. Social psychologists Quattrone and Jones conducted a study demonstrating this with students from the rival schools [[Princeton University]] and [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.1.141 |title=The perception of variability within in-groups and out-groups: Implications for the law of small numbers |year=1980 |last1=Quattrone |first1=George A. |last2=Jones |first2=Edward E. |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=38 |pages=141–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students at each school were shown videos of other students from each school choosing a type of music to listen to for an auditory perception study. Then the participants were asked to guess what percentage of the videotaped students' classmates would choose the same. Participants predicted a much greater similarity between out-group members (the rival school) than between members of their in-group.

The justification-suppression model of prejudice was created by Christian Crandall and Amy Eshleman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.414 |title=A justification-suppression model of the expression and experience of prejudice |year=2003 |last1=Crandall |first1=Christian S. |last2=Eshleman |first2=Amy |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=414–46 |pmid=12784937}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model explains that people face a conflict between the desire to express prejudice and the desire to maintain a positive [[self-concept]]. This conflict causes people to search for justification for disliking an out-group, and to use that justification to avoid negative feelings ([[cognitive dissonance]]) about themselves when they act on their dislike of the out-group.

The [[realistic conflict theory]] states that competition between limited resources leads to increased negative prejudices and discrimination. This can be seen even when the resource is insignificant. In the Robber's Cave experiment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Muzafer |last1=Sherif |first2=O. J. |last2=Harvey |first3=B. Jack |last3=White |first4=William R. |last4=Hood |first5=Carolyn W. |last5=Sherif |year=1988 |title=The Robbers Cave Experiment: Intergroup Conflict and Cooperation |location=Middletown, Connecticut |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |isbn=978-0-8195-6194-7}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; negative prejudice and hostility was created between two summer camps after sports competitions for small prizes. The hostility was lessened after the two competing camps were forced to cooperate on tasks to achieve a common goal.

Another contemporary theory is the [[integrated threat theory]] (ITT), which was developed by Walter G Stephan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2000.tb01022.x |title=Women's Attitudes Toward Men: an Integrated Threat Theory Approach |year=2000 |last1=Stephan |first1=Cookie White |last2=Stephan |first2=Walter C. |last3=Demitrakis |first3=Katherine M. |last4=Yamada |first4=Ann Marie |last5=Clason |first5=Dennis L. |journal=[[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] |volume=24 |pages=63–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws from and builds upon several other psychological explanations of prejudice and ingroup/outgroup behaviour, such as the realistic conflict theory and [[symbolic racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1004_4 |title=Intergroup Threat and Outgroup Attitudes: A Meta-Analytic Review |year=2006 |last1=Riek |first1=Blake M. |last2=Mania |first2=Eric W. |last3=Gaertner |first3=Samuel L. |journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Review]] |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=336–53 |pmid=17201592}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses the [[social identity theory]] perspective as the basis for its validity; that is, it assumes that individuals operate in a group-based context where group memberships form a part of individual identity. ITT posits that outgroup prejudice and discrimination is caused when individuals perceive an outgroup to be threatening in some way. ITT defines four threats: 
* Realistic threats
* Symbolic threats
* Intergroup anxiety
* Negative stereotypes

Realistic threats are tangible, such as competition for a natural resource or a threat to income. Symbolic threats arise from a perceived difference in cultural values between groups or a perceived imbalance of power (for example, an ingroup perceiving an outgroup's religion as incompatible with theirs). Intergroup anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness experienced in the presence of an outgroup or outgroup member, which constitutes a threat because interactions with other groups cause negative feelings (e.g., a threat to comfortable interactions). Negative stereotypes are similarly threats, in that individuals anticipate negative behaviour from outgroup members in line with the perceived stereotype (for example, that the outgroup is violent). Often these stereotypes are associated with emotions such as fear and anger. ITT differs from other threat theories by including intergroup anxiety and negative stereotypes as threat types.

Additionally, [[social dominance theory]] states that society can be viewed as group-based hierarchies. In competition for scarce resources such as housing or employment, dominant groups create prejudiced "legitimizing myths" to provide moral and intellectual justification for their dominant position over other groups and validate their claim over the limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.476 |title=Racism, conservatism, Affirmative Action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance? |year=1996 |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |last3=Bobo |first3=Lawrence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=476–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legitimizing myths, such as discriminatory hiring practices or biased merit norms, work to maintain these prejudiced hierarchies.

Prejudice can be a central contributing factor to depression.&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1745691612455204 |title=Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |year=2012 |last1=Cox |first1=William T. L. |last2=Abramson |first2=Lyn Y. |last3=Devine |first3=Patricia G. |last4=Hollon |first4=Steven D. |journal=[[Perspectives on Psychological Science]] |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=427–49 |pmid=26168502}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur in someone who is a prejudice victim, being the target of someone else's prejudice, or when people have prejudice against themselves that causes their own depression.

Paul Bloom argues that while prejudice can be irrational and have terrible consequences, it is natural and often quite rational. This is because prejudices are based on the human tendency to categorise objects and people based on prior experience. This means people make predictions about things in a category based on prior experience with that category, with the resulting predictions usually being accurate (though not always). Bloom argues that this process of categorisation and prediction is necessary for survival and normal interaction, quoting William Hazlitt, who stated "Without the aid of prejudice and custom, I should not be able to find my way my across the room; nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances, nor what to feel in any relation of life".&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Paul [https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_can_prejudice_ever_be_a_good_thing/transcript "Can prejudice ever be a good thing"] January 2014, accessed 02/12/17&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, researchers have argued that the study of prejudice has been traditionally too narrow. It is argued that since prejudice is defined as a negative affect towards members of a group, there are many groups against whom prejudice is acceptable (such as rapists, men who abandon their families, pedophiles, neo-Nazis, drink-drivers, queue jumpers, murderers etc.), yet such prejudices aren't studied. It has been suggested that researchers have focused too much on an evaluative approach to prejudice, rather than a descriptive approach, which looks at the actual psychological mechanisms behind prejudiced attitudes. It is argued that this limits research to targets of prejudice to groups deemed to be receiving unjust treatment, while groups researchers deem treated justly or deservedly of prejudice are overlooked. As a result, the scope of prejudice has begun to expand in research, allowing a more accurate analysis of the relationship between psychological traits and prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crandell |first1= Christian S. |last2=Ferguson |first2=Mark A. |last3=Bahns |first3=Angela J.|editor-last1=Stangor |editor-first1=Charles |editor-last2=Crendeall |editor-first2=Christian S. |title=Stereotyping and Prejudice |publisher=Psychology Press |date=2013 |chapter=Chapter 3: When We See Prejudice |isbn=978-1848726444}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Jarret, and Mark J.

==Controversies and prominent topics==
One can be prejudiced against or have a preconceived notion about someone due to any characteristic they find to be unusual or undesirable. A few commonplace examples of prejudice are those based on someone's race, gender, nationality, social status, sexual orientation, or religious affiliation, and controversies may arise from any given topic.

===Sexism===
{{Main article|Sexism}}
Sexism, also called gender discrimination, is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's [[Sex and gender distinction|sex or gender]]. Sexism can affect either gender, but it is particularly documented as affecting women and girls.&lt;ref name="Sexism"&gt;There is a clear and broad consensus among academic scholars in multiple fields that sexism refers primarily to discrimination against women, and primarily affects women. See, for example:
*{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=New Oxford American Dictionary |title=Sexism |access-date= |edition=3 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199891535}} Defines sexism as "prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Academic Edition |year=2015}} Defines sexism as "prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls." Notes that "sexism in a society is most commonly applied against women and girls.  It functions to maintain patriarchy, or male domination, through ideological and material practices of individuals, collectives, and institutions that oppress women and girls on the basis of sex or gender."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Cudd|first1=Ann E.|last2=Jones|first2=Leslie E.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=A Companion to Applied Ethics |year=2005 |publisher=Blackwell |location=London}} Notes that "'Sexism' refers to a historically and globally pervasive form of oppression against women."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Masequesmay|first=Gina|editor-last=O'Brien|editor-first=Jodi|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society |year=2008 |publisher=SAGE}} Notes that "sexism usually refers to prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls." Also states that "sexism is an ideology or practices that maintain patriarchy or male domination." 
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hornsby |first=Jennifer|editor-last=Honderich|editor-first=Ted|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |edition=2 |year=2005|publisher=Oxford}} Defines sexism as "thought or practice which may permeate language and which assume's women's inferiority to men."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Collins Dictionary of Sociology  |year=2006 |publisher=Harper Collins}} Defines sexism as "any devaluation or denigration of women or men, but particularly women, which is embodied in institutions and social relationships."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Palgrave MacMillan Dictionary of Political Thought |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan}} Notes that "either sex may be the object of sexist attitudes... however, it is commonly held that, in developed societies, women have been the usual victims."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Love, Courtship, and Sexuality through History, Volume 6: The Modern World |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood}} "Sexism is any act, attitude, or institutional configuration that systematically subordinates or devalues women.  Built upon the belief that men and women are constitutionally different, sexism takes these differences as indications that men are inherently superior to women, which then is used to justify the nearly universal dominance of men in social and familial relationships, as well as politics, religion, language, law, and economics."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Foster |first=Carly Hayden |editor-last=Kurlan|editor-first=George Thomas|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Political Science |title=Sexism |year=2011 |publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9781608712434}} Notes that "both men and women can experience sexism, but sexism against women is more pervasive."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Johnson|first=Allan G.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell |location= |id= }} Suggests that "the key test of whether something is sexist... lies in its consequences: if it supports male privilege, then it is by definition sexist. I specify 'male privilege' because in every known society where gender inequality exists, males are privileged over females."
*{{cite book |last=Lorber |first=Judith |year=2011 |title=Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=5}} Notes that "although we speak of gender inequality, it is usually women who are disadvantaged relative to similarly situated men."
*{{cite book |last1=Wortman |first1=Camille B. |last2=Loftus |first2=Elizabeth S. |last3=Weaver |first3=Charles A |title=Psychology |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1999}} "As throughout history, today women are the primary victims of sexism, prejudice directed at one sex, even in the United States."
&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion of such sentiments, and actual gender differences and stereotypes continue to be controversial topics. Throughout history, women have been thought of as being subordinate to men, often being ignored in areas like the academia or belittled altogether. Traditionally, men were thought of as being more capable than women, mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="Dovidio"&gt;Dovidio, John, Peter Glick, and Laurie Rudman. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CDSyHPt98E0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On the Nature of Prejudice]''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 108. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of social psychology, prejudice studies like the "Who Likes Competent Women" study led the way for gender-based research on prejudice.&lt;ref name="Dovidio" /&gt; This resulted in two broad themes or focuses in the field: the first being a focus on attitudes toward [[gender equality]], and the second focusing on people's beliefs about men and women.&lt;ref name="Dovidio" /&gt; Today, studies based on sexism continue in the field of psychology as researchers try to understand how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors influence and are influenced by others.

===Nationalism===
{{Main article|Nationalism}}
Nationalism is a sentiment based on common cultural characteristics that binds a population and often produces a policy of national independence or [[separatism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nationalism "Nationalism"], dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests a "shared identity" amongst a nation's people that minimizes differences within the group and emphasizes perceived boundaries between the group and non-members.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackwell |first1=Judith |first2=Murray |last2=Smith |first3=John |last3=Sorenson |title=Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science |location=Toronto |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2003 |pages=31–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the assumption that members of the nation have more in common than they actually do, that they are "culturally unified", even if injustices within the nation based on differences like status and race exist.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt; During times of conflict between one nation and another, nationalism is controversial since it may function as a buffer for criticism when it comes to the nation's own problems since it makes the nation's own hierarchies and internal conflicts appear to be natural.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt; It may also serve a way of rallying the people of the nation in support of a particular political goal.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt; Nationalism usually involves a push for conformity, obedience, and solidarity amongst the nation's people and can result not only in feelings of public responsibility but also in a narrow sense of community due to the exclusion of those who are considered outsiders.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt; Since the identity of nationalists is linked to their allegiance to the state, the presence of strangers who do not share this allegiance may result in hostility.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt;

===Classism===
{{Main article|Classism}}
Classism is defined by [[dictionary.com]] as "a biased or discriminatory attitude on distinctions made between social or economic classes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/classism "Classism"], dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of separating people based on class is controversial in itself. Some argue that [[economic inequality]] is an unavoidable aspect of society, so there will always be a ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Judith, Murray Smith, and John Sorenson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zUbvP87QKX0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science]''. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2003. 145. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some also argue that, even within the most [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] societies in history, some form of ranking based on social status takes place. Therefore, one may believe the existence of social classes is a natural feature of society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Blackwell, Judith, Murray Smith, and John Sorenson. ''Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science''. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2003. 146. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue the contrary. According to [[Anthropology|anthropological]] evidence, for the majority of the time the human species has been in existence, humans have lived in a manner in which the land and resources were not privately owned.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Also, when social ranking did occur, it was not antagonistic or hostile like the current class system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This evidence has been used to support the idea that the existence of a social class system is unnecessary. Overall, society has neither come to a consensus over the necessity of the class system, nor been able to deal with the hostility and prejudice that occurs because of the class system.

===Sexual discrimination===
{{Main article|Sexual discrimination|Homophobia}}
One's sexual orientation is the "direction of one's sexual interest toward members of the same, opposite, or both sexes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+orientation "Sexual Orientation"], dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Like most minority groups, [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]s and [[Bisexuality|bisexuals]] are not immune to prejudice or stereotypes from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexual preferences; a term for such intense hatred based upon one's sexual orientation is ''[[homophobia]]''.

Due to what social psychologists call the vividness effect, a tendency to notice only certain distinctive characteristics, the majority population tends to draw conclusions like gays flaunt their sexuality.&lt;ref name="Anderson, Kristin 2010"&gt;Anderson, Kristin. ''Benign Bigotry: The Psychology of Subtle Prejudice''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010. 198. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Such images may be easily recalled to mind due to their vividness, making it harder to appraise the entire situation.&lt;ref name="Anderson, Kristin 2010"/&gt; The majority population may not only think that homosexuals flaunt their sexuality or are "too gay", but may also erroneously believe that homosexuals are easy to identify and label as being gay or lesbian when compared to others who are not homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Kristin. ''Benign Bigotry: The Psychology of Subtle Prejudice''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010. 200. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of [[heterosexual privilege]] seems to flourish in society. Research and questionnaires are formulated to fit the majority; i.e., [[Heterosexuality|heterosexuals]]. This discussion of whether heterosexuals are the privileged group and whether homosexuals are a minimized group is controversial. Research shows that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a powerful feature of many labor markets. For example, controlling for human capital, studies show that gay men earn 10% - 32% less than heterosexual men in the United States, and that there is significant discrimination in hiring on the basis of sexual orientation in many labor markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tilcsik | first1 = A | year = 2011 | title = Pride and Prejudice: Employment Discrimination against Openly Gay Men in the United States | url = | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 117 | issue = 2| pages = 586–626 | pmid = 22268247 | doi=10.1086/661653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism===
Racism is defined as the belief that physical characteristics determine cultural traits, and that racial characteristics make some groups superior.&lt;ref name="Blackwell37"&gt;Blackwell, Judith, Murray Smith, and John Sorenson. ''Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science''. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2003. 37–38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; By separating people into [[Racial hierarchy|hierarchies]] based upon their race, it has been argued that unequal treatment among the different groups of people is just and fair due to their [[Genetics|genetic]] differences.&lt;ref name="Blackwell37" /&gt; Racism can occur amongst any group that can be identified based upon physical features or even characteristics of their culture.&lt;ref name="Blackwell37" /&gt; Though people may be lumped together and called a specific race, everyone does not fit neatly into such categories, making it hard to define and describe a race accurately.&lt;ref name="Blackwell37" /&gt;

[[Scientific racism]] began to flourish in the eighteenth century and was greatly influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[evolution]]ary studies, as well as ideas taken from the writings of philosophers like [[Aristotle]]; for example, Aristotle believed in the concept of "[[Natural slavery|natural slaves]]".&lt;ref name="Blackwell37" /&gt; This concept focuses on the necessity of hierarchies and how some people are bound to be on the bottom of the pyramid. Though racism has been a prominent topic in history, there is still debate over whether race actually exists,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} making the discussion of race a controversial topic. Even though the concept of race is still being debated, the effects of racism are apparent. Racism and other forms of prejudice can affect a person's behavior, thoughts, and feelings, and social psychologists strive to study these effects.

===Religious discrimination===
{{Main article|Religious discrimination}}

While various religions teach their members to be tolerant of those who are different and to have compassion, throughout history there have been [[Religious war|wars]], [[pogrom]]s and other forms of violence motivated by hatred of religious groups.&lt;ref name="Dovidio, John 2005"&gt;Dovidio, John, Peter Glick, and Laurie Rudman. ''On the Nature of Prejudice''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 413. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern world, researchers in western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic countries have done various studies exploring the relationship between religion and prejudice; thus far, they have received mixed results. A study done with US college students found that those who reported religion to be very influential in their lives seem to have a higher rate of prejudice than those who reported not being religious.&lt;ref name="Dovidio, John 2005"/&gt; Other studies found that religion has a positive effect on people as far as prejudice is concerned.&lt;ref name="Dovidio, John 2005"/&gt; This difference in results may be attributed to the differences in religious practices or religious interpretations amongst the individuals. Those who practice "institutionalized religion", which focuses more on social and political aspects of religious events, are more likely to have an increase in prejudice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dovidio, John, Peter Glick, and Laurie Rudman. ''On the Nature of Prejudice''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 414. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who practice "interiorized religion", in which believers devote themselves to their beliefs, are most likely to have a decrease in prejudice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Linguistic discrimination===
{{Main article|Linguistic discrimination}}

Individuals or groups may be treated unfairly based solely on their use of language. This use of language may include the individual's [[native language]] or other characteristics of the person's speech, such as an [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]], the size of [[vocabulary]] (whether the person uses complex and varied words), and [[syntax]]. It may also involve a person's ability or inability to use one language instead of another.
In the mid-1980s, [[linguistics|linguist]] Tove Skutnabb-Kangas captured this idea of discrimination based on language as the concept of linguicism. Kangas defined linguicism as the ideologies and structures used to "legitimate, effectuate, and reproduce unequal division of power and resources (both material and non-material) between groups which are defined on the basis of language."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove, and Phillipson, Robert, {{"'}}Mother Tongue': The Theoretical and Sociopolitical Construction of a Concept". In Ammon, Ulrich (ed.) (1989), ''Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties'', p. 455. Berlin, New York: Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co. {{ISBN|3-11-011299-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurological discrimination===
{{Main article|Neurodiversity}}
{{See also|Ableism}}
Broadly speaking, attribution of low social status to those who do not conform to [[neurotypical]] expectations of personality and behaviour. This can manifest through assumption of 'disability' status to those who are high functioning enough to exist outside of diagnostic criteria, yet do not desire to (or are unable to) conform their behaviour to conventional patterns. This is a controversial and somewhat contemporary concept; with various disciplinary approaches promoting conflicting messages what normality constitutes, the degree of acceptable [[Differential psychology|individual difference]] within that category, and the precise criteria for what constitutes medical disorder. This has been most prominent in the case of high-functioning autism,&lt;ref name="Silberman, Steve 2015"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WRpPDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false NeuroTribes: The legacy of autism and how to think smarter about people who think differently]''. Allen &amp; Unwin. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where direct cognitive benefits increasingly appear to come at the expense of social intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination may also extend to other high functioning individuals carrying pathological phenotypes, such as those with [[ADHD|attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar spectrum disorders]]. In these cases, there are indications that perceived (or actual) socially disadvantageous cognitive traits are directly correlated with advantageous cognitive traits in other domains, notably creativity and divergent thinking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet these strengths might become systematically overlooked. The case for "neurological discrimination" as such lies in the expectation that one's professional capacity may be judged by the quality of ones social interaction, which can in such cases be an inaccurate and discriminatory metric for employment suitability.

Since there are moves by some experts to have these higher-functioning extremes reclassified as extensions of human personality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| pages=873–883}}&lt;/ref&gt; any legitimisation of discrimination against these groups would fit the very definition of prejudice, as medical validation for such discrimination becomes redundant. Recent advancements in [[behavioural genetics]] and [[neuroscience]] have made this a very relevant issue of discussion, with existing frameworks requiring significant overhaul to accommodate the strength of findings over the last decade.

==Multiculturalism==
{{Main article|Multiculturalism}}
Humans have an evolved propensity to think categorically about social groups, manifested in cognitive processes with broad implications for public and political endorsement of multicultural policy, according to psychologists [[Richard J. Crisp]] and Rose Meleady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1219009 |title=Adapting to a Multicultural Future |year=2012 |last1=Crisp |first1=Richard J. |last2=Meleady |first2=Rose |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=336 |issue=6083 |pages=853–5 |pmid=22605761|bibcode=2012Sci...336..853C }}&lt;/ref&gt; They postulated a cognitive-evolutionary account of human adaptation to social diversity that explains general resistance to multiculturalism, and offer a reorienting call for scholars and policy-makers who seek intervention-based solutions to the problem of prejudice.

==Reducing prejudice==

===The contact hypothesis===
The [[contact hypothesis]] predicts that prejudice can only be reduced when in-group and out-group members are brought together.&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 2010"&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. M. (2010). ''Social Psychology'' (7th edition). New York: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there are six conditions that must be met to reduce prejudice, as were cultivated in [[Elliot Aronson]]'s [[jigsaw (teaching technique)|"jigsaw" teaching technique]].&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 2010"/&gt; First, the in- and out-groups must have a degree of mutual interdependence. Second, both groups need to share a common goal. Third, the two groups must have equal status. Fourth, there must be frequent opportunities for informal and interpersonal contact between groups. Fifth, there should be multiple contacts between the in- and the out-groups. Finally, [[social norm]]s of equality must exist and be present to foster prejudice reduction.

===Empirical research===
Academics Thomas Pettigrew and Linda Tropp conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of 515 studies involving a quarter of a million participants in 38 nations to examine how intergroup contact reduces prejudice. They found that three [[Mediation (statistics)|mediators]] are of particular importance: Intergroup contact reduces prejudice by (1) enhancing knowledge about the outgroup, (2) reducing anxiety about intergroup contact, and (3) increasing [[empathy]] and perspective-taking. While all three of these mediators had mediational effects, the mediational value of increased knowledge was less strong than anxiety reduction and empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pettigrew |first1= Thomas F. |last2= Tropp |first2= Linda R. |year= 2008 |title= How does intergroup contact reduce prejudice?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19839">'''"Quality of Working Life"''' ('''QWL''') is a term that had been used to describe the broader [[employment|job]]-related experience an individual has.

==Models and components==
Various authors and researchers have proposed models of quality of working life, (also referred to as quality of worklife) which include a wide range of factors. Selected models are reviewed below.

Hackman and Oldham (1976)&lt;ref&gt;Hackman J &amp; Oldham G (1974) The Job Diagnostic Survey. New Haven: Yale University.&lt;/ref&gt; drew attention to what they described as psychological growth needs as relevant to the consideration of Quality of working life. Several such needs were identified :
* Skill variety,
* Task Identity, 
* Task significance, 
* Autonomy  
* Feedback.
{{see also|Job characteristic theory}}

They suggested that such needs have to be addressed if employees are to experience high quality of working life.

In contrast to such theory based models, Taylor (1979)&lt;ref&gt;Taylor J C in Cooper, CL and Mumford, E (1979) The quality of working life in Western and Eastern Europe. ABP&lt;/ref&gt; more pragmatically identified the essential components of quality of working life as basic extrinsic job factors of wages, hours and working conditions, and the intrinsic job notions of the nature of the work itself. He suggested that a number of other aspects could be added, including :
* individual power, 
* employee participation in the management, 
* fairness and equity, 
* social support, 
* use of one’s present skills, 
* self-development, 
* a meaningful future at work, 
* social relevance of the work or product, 
* effect on extra work activities.

Taylor suggested that relevant quality of working life concepts may vary according to organisation and employee group.

Warr and colleagues (1979),&lt;ref name="Warretal"&gt;Warr, P, Cook, J and Wall, T (1979) Scales for the measurement of some work attitudes and aspects of psychological well being. Journal of Occupational Psychology. 52, 129-148.&lt;/ref&gt; in an investigation of quality of working life, considered a range of apparently relevant factors, including :
* work involvement, 
* intrinsic job motivation, 
* higher order need strength, 
* perceived intrinsic job characteristics, 
* [[job satisfaction]], 
* [[life satisfaction]], 
* [[happiness]], and 
* self-rated anxiety.

They discussed a range of correlations derived from their work, such as those between work involvement and job satisfaction, intrinsic job motivation and job satisfaction, and perceived intrinsic job characteristics and job satisfaction. In particular, Warr et al. found evidence for a moderate association between total job satisfaction and total [[life satisfaction]] and [[happiness]], with a less strong, but significant association with self-rated anxiety.

Thus, whilst some authors have emphasised the workplace aspects in quality of working life, others have identified the relevance of personality factors, psychological well being, and broader concepts of [[happiness]] and [[life satisfaction]].

Factors more obviously and directly affecting work have, however, served as the main focus of attention, as researchers have tried to tease out the important influences on quality of working life in the workplace.

Mirvis and Lawler (1984)&lt;ref&gt;Mirvis, P.H. and Lawler, E.E. (1984) Accounting for the Quality of Work Life. Journal of Occupational Behaviour. 5. 197-212.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that quality of working life was associated with satisfaction with wages, hours and working conditions, describing the “basic elements of a good quality of work life” as :
* safe work environment, 
* equitable wages, 
* equal employment opportunities  
* opportunities for advancement.
* opportunities to learn and grow
* protection of individual rights  

Baba and Jamal (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Baba, VV and Jamal, M (1991) Routinisation of job context and job content as related to employees quality of working life: a study of psychiatric nurses. Journal of organisational behaviour. 12. 379-386.&lt;/ref&gt; listed what they described as typical indicators of quality of working life, including: 
* job satisfaction, 
* job involvement, 
* work role ambiguity, 
* work role conflict, 
* work role overload, 
* job stress, 
* organisational commitment and 
* turn-over intentions.

Baba and Jamal also explored routinisation of job content, suggesting that this facet should be investigated as part of the concept of quality of working life.

Some have argued that quality of working life might vary between groups of workers. For example, Ellis and Pompli (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Ellis N &amp; Pompli A 2002 Quality of working life for nurses. Commonwealth Dept of Health and Ageing. Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt; identified a number of factors contributing to job dissatisfaction and quality of working life in nurses, including: 
* poor working environments, 
* resident aggression, 
* workload, inability to deliver quality of care preferred, 
* balance of work and family, 
* [[shiftwork]], 
* lack of involvement in decision making, 
* professional isolation, 
* lack of recognition, 
* poor relationships with supervisor/peers, 
* role conflict, 
* lack of opportunity to learn new skills.

Sirgy et al. (2001)&lt;ref name="Sirgyetal"&gt;Sirgy, M. J., Efraty,, D., Siegel, P &amp; Lee, D. (2001). A new measure of quality of work life (QoWL) based on need satisfaction and [[Knowledge spillover|spillover]] theories. Social Indicators Research, 55, 241-302.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the key factors in quality of working life are:
* need satisfaction based on job requirements, 
* need satisfaction based on work environment, 
* need satisfaction based on supervisory behaviour, 
* need satisfaction based on ancillary programmes, 
* organizational commitment.

They defined quality of working life as satisfaction of these key needs through resources, activities, and outcomes stemming from participation in the workplace. Needs as defined by the psychologist, [[Abraham Maslow]], were seen as relevant in underpinning this model, covering health &amp; safety, economic and family, social, esteem, actualisation, knowledge and aesthetics, although the relevance of non-work aspects is play down as attention is focussed on quality of work life rather than the broader concept of [[quality of life]].

These attempts at defining quality of working life have included theoretical approaches, lists of identified factors, correlational analyses, with opinions varying as to whether such definitions and explanations can be both global, or need to be specific to each work setting.

Bearfield, (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Bearfield, S (2003)Quality of Working Life. Aciirt Working paper 86. University of Sydney. www.acirrt.com&lt;/ref&gt; used 16 questions to examine quality of working life, and distinguished between causes of dissatisfaction in professionals, intermediate clerical, sales and service workers, indicating that different concerns might have to be addressed for different groups.

The distinction made between job satisfaction and dissatisfaction in quality of working life reflects the influence of job satisfaction theories. Herzberg at al., (1959)&lt;ref&gt;Herzberg F, Mausner B, &amp; Snyderman B., (1959) The Motivation to Work. New York:Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; used “Hygiene factors” and “Motivator factors” to distinguish between the separate causes of job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction. It has been suggested that Motivator factors are intrinsic to the job, that is; job content, the work itself, responsibility and advancement. The Hygiene factors or dissatisfaction-avoidance factors include aspects of the job environment such as interpersonal relationships, salary, working conditions and security. Of these latter, the most common cause of job dissatisfaction can be company policy and administration, whilst achievement can be the greatest source of extreme satisfaction.

Nanjundeswaraswamy and Swamy (2013) used 9 components to measure quality of worklife of employees in private technical institutions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T S Nanjundeswaraswamy, Swamy D R|year=2013|title=QUALITY OF WORKLIFE OF EMPLOYEES IN PRIVATE TECHNICAL INSTITUTION|journal=International Journal for Quality Research|volume=7|issue=3|pages=3–14|url=https://www.academia.edu/10946375/QUALITY_OF_WORKLIFE_OF_EMPLOYEES_IN_PRIVATE_TECHNICAL_INSTITUTIONS|issn= 1800-6450}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Work environment
*Organization culture and climate
*Relation and co-operation
*Training and development
*Compensation and Rewards
*Facilities
*Job satisfaction and Job security
*Autonomy of work
*Adequacy of resources

Male employees are more satisfied than female employees the chi square test confirms that all the demographic factors like gender, designation, salary, department, experience are independent of quality of worklife of employees in private technical institution. Study also reveals that there is a significant association between QWL of Teaching and Non teaching staffs. From the correlation analysis it is find that Adequacy of Resources are more correlated and Training &amp; Development are less correlated with teaching staffs perception towards quality of worklife and in case of non teaching staffs Compensation &amp; Rewards are more correlated and Work Environment are less correlated with QWL.

An individual’s experience of satisfaction or dissatisfaction can be substantially rooted in their perception, rather than simply reflecting their “real world”. Further, an individual’s perception can be affected by relative comparison – am I paid as much as that person - and comparisons of internalised ideals, aspirations, and expectations, for example, with the individual’s current state (Lawler and Porter, 1966).&lt;ref name="Lawler&amp;Porter"&gt;Lawler III E and Porter L, (1966). Managers pay and their satisfaction with their pay. Personnel Psychology. XIX 363-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, where it has been considered, authors differ in their views on the core constituents of Quality of Working Life (e.g. Sirgy, Efraty, Siegel &amp; Lee, 2001&lt;ref name="Sirgyetal"/&gt; and Warr, Cook &amp; Wall, 1979).&lt;ref name="Warretal"/&gt;

It has generally been agreed however that Quality of Working Life is conceptually similar to well-being of employees but differs from job satisfaction which solely represents the workplace domain (Lawler, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, E. E. (1982). Strategies for improving the quality of work life. American Psychologist, 37, 2005, 486-493.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quality of Working Life is not a unitary concept, but has been seen as incorporating a hierarchy of perspectives that not only include work-based factors such as job satisfaction, satisfaction with pay and relationships with work colleagues, but also factors that broadly reflect [[life satisfaction]] and general feelings of well-being (Danna &amp; Griffin, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Danna, K. &amp; Griffin, R. W. (1999). Health and well-being in the workplace: A review and synthesis of the literature. Journal of Management, 25, 357-384.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, work-related stress and the relationship between work and non-work life domains (Loscocco &amp; Roschelle, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Loscocco, K. A. &amp; Roschelle, A. N. (1991). Influences on the Quality of Work and Nonwork Life: Two Decades in Review. Journal of Vocational Behavior, 39, 182-225.&lt;/ref&gt; have also been identified as factors that should conceptually be included in Quality of Working Life.

==Measurement==
There are few recognised measures of quality of working life, and of those that exist, few have evidence of validity and reliability, although the '''Brief Index of Affective Job Satisfaction''' has been systematically developed to be reliable and is rigorously psychometrically validated.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E.R|author2=Phua, F.T.T. |title=A Brief Index of Affective Job Satisfaction|journal=Group &amp; Organization Management|year=2012|volume=37|issue=3|pages=275–307|doi=10.1177/1059601111434201 |url=http://gom.sagepub.com/content/37/3/275}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''Brief Index of Affective Job Satisfaction''' (BIAFJS) is a 4-item, purely affective as opposed to cognitive, measure of overall affective job satisfaction that reflects quality of working life.  The BIAJS differs from other job satisfaction measures in being comprehensively validated not just for internal consistency reliability, temporal stability, convergent and criterion-related validities, but also for cross-population invariance by nationality, job level, and job type. Reported internal consistency reliabilities range between .81 and .87.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Statistical analysis of the '''Work-Related Quality of Life scale (WRQoL)''',&lt;ref name="VanLaarEdwardsEaston"&gt;Van Laar, D, Edwards, J &amp; Easton, S (2007). The Work-Related Quality of Life scale for healthcare workers. Journal of Advanced Nursing, Volume 60, Number 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;325–333&lt;/ref&gt; provides support for the psychometric structure of this instrument. The WRQoWL measure &lt;ref&gt;Easton, S. &amp; Van Laar, D. (2013) User Manual for the Work-Related Quality of Life (WRQoL) Scale. University of Portsmouth. UK. http://www.qowl.co.uk/researchers/WRQoL%20User%20manual%20v38%20ebook%2003%20Nov14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; uses six core factors to explain most of the variation in an individuals quality of working life: Job and Career Satisfaction; Working Conditions; General Well-Being; Home-Work Interface; Stress at Work and Control at Work.

The '''Job &amp; Career Satisfaction (JCS) scale''' of the Work-Related Quality of Life scale (WRQoL) is said to reflect an employee’s feelings about, or evaluation of, their satisfaction or contentment with their job and career and the training they receive to do it. Within the WRQoL measure, JCS is reflected by questions asking how satisfied people feel about their work.  It has been proposed that this Positive Job Satisfaction factor is influenced by various issues including clarity of goals and role ambiguity, appraisal, recognition and reward, personal development career benefits and enhancement and training needs.

The '''General well-being (GWB) scale''' of the Work-Related Quality of Life scale (WRQoL),&lt;ref name="VanLaarEdwardsEaston"/&gt; aims to assess the extent to which an individual feels good or content in themselves, in a way which may be independent of their work situation. It is suggested that general well-being both influences, and is influenced by work. Mental health problems, predominantly depression and anxiety disorders, are common, and may have a major impact on the general well-being of the population. The WRQoL GWB factor assesses issues of mood, depression and anxiety, [[life satisfaction]], general [[quality of life]], optimism and [[happiness]].

The '''WRQoL Stress at Work sub-scale (SAW)''' reflects the extent to which an individual perceives they have excessive pressures, and feel stressed at work. The WRQoL SAW factor is assessed through items dealing with demand and perception of stress and actual demand overload. Whilst it is possible to be pressured at work and not be stressed at work, in general, high stress is associated with high pressure.

The '''Control at Work (CAW) subscale''' of the WRQoL scale addresses how much employees feel they can control their work through the freedom to express their opinions and being involved in decisions at work. Perceived [[job control (workplace)|control at work]] as measured by the Work-Related Quality of Life scale (WRQoL)&lt;ref name="VanLaarEdwardsEaston"/&gt; is recognized as a central concept in the understanding of relationships between stressful experiences, behaviour and health. Control at work, within the theoretical model underpinning the WRQoL, is influenced by issues of communication at work, decision making and decision control.

The '''WRQoL Home-Work Interface scale (HWI)''' measures the extent to which an employer is perceived to support the family and home life of employees. This factor explores the interrelationship between home and work life domains. Issues that appear to influence employee HWI include adequate facilities at work, flexible working hours and the understanding of managers.

The '''Working Conditions scale''' of the WRQoL assesses the extent to which the employee is satisfied with the fundamental resources, working conditions and security necessary to do their job effectively. Physical working conditions influence employee health and safety and thus employee Quality of working life. This scale also taps into satisfaction with the resources provided to help people do their jobs.

==Applications==
Regular assessment of Quality of Working Life can potentially provide organisations with important information about the welfare of their employees, such as job satisfaction, general well-being, work-related stress and the home-work interface. Studies in the UK University sector have shown a valid measure of Quality of Working Life exists&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J., Van Laar, D.L. &amp; Easton, S. (2009). The Work-Related Quality of Life (WRQoL) scale for Higher Education Employees. Quality in Higher Education. 15: 3, 207-219.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used as a basis for effective interventions.

Worrall and Cooper (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Worrall, L. &amp; Cooper, C. L. (2006). The Quality of Working Life: Managers’ health and well-being. Executive Report, Chartered Management Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that a low level of well-being at work is estimated to cost about 5-10% of Gross National Product per annum, yet Quality of Working Life as a theoretical construct remains relatively unexplored and unexplained within the organisational psychology research literature.

A large chunk of most peoples’ lives will be spent at work. Most people recognise the importance of sleeping well, and actively try to enjoy the leisure time that they can snatch. But all too often, people tend to see work as something they just have to put up with, or even something they don’t even expect to enjoy.

Some of the factors used to measure quality of working life pick up on things that don’t actually make people feel good, but which seem to make people feel bad about work if those things are absent. For example, noise – if the place where someone works is too noisy, they might get frequent headaches, or find they cannot concentrate, and so feel dissatisfied. But when it is quiet enough they don’t feel pleased or happy - they just don’t feel bad. This can apply to a range of factors that affect someone's working conditions.

Other things seem to be more likely to make people feel good about work and themselves once the basics are OK at work. Challenging work (not too little, not too much) can make them feel good. Similarly, opportunities for career progression and using their abilities can contribute to someone's quality of working life.

A publication of the [[National Institute of Clinical Excellence]] (NICE)&lt;ref&gt;[[National Institute of Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) public health guidance 22; [http://www.nice.org.uk/PH22 Promoting mental wellbeing through productive and healthy working conditions].&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises the core role of assessment and understanding of the way working environments pose risks for psychological wellbeing through lack of control and excessive demand. The emphasis placed by NICE on assessment and monitoring wellbeing springs from the fact that these processes are the key first step in identifying areas for improving quality of working life and addressing risks at work.

A '''rabbit punch''' is a [[punch (strike)|blow]] to the back of the head or to the base of the [[skull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/rabbit-punching-boxing-3702.html |title=What Is Rabbit Punching in Boxing? |first=Matthew |last=Lee |publisher=AZCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered especially dangerous because it can damage the [[cervical vertebrae]] and subsequently the [[spinal cord]], which may lead to serious and irreparable [[spinal cord injury]].  A rabbit punch can also detach the victim's brain from the brain stem,{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} which can kill instantly.

The punch's name is derived from the use of the technique by [[hunter]]s to kill [[rabbit]]s with a quick, sharp [[strike (attack)|strike]] to the back of the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Langer |first=Richard |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040501011125/http://www.motherearthnews.com/menarch/archive/issues/015/015-018-01.htm |title=Extract from "Grow it!" |publisher=''www.motherearthnews.com'' |url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/menarch/archive/issues/015/015-018-01.htm |archivedate=2004-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2014, soccer referee John Bieniewicz was punched in the neck by Baseel Abdul Amir Saad, an upset player in an amateur match he was officiating in [[Livonia, Michigan]], a suburb of Detroit. Bieniewicz died two days later of his injuries, and Saad was charged with second-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/man-accused-of-murder-in-michigan-referee-death-due-in-court/ |title=Man accused of fatally punching Mich. referee due in court |date= July 30, 2014 |publisher= [[Associated Press]] |accessdate= August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bieniewicz’s autopsy showed that the force of the impact on the left side of his neck just below the base of his skull had resulted in a rare injury with twisted and torn arteries around the base of his skull, knocking him out before he hit the ground. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.freep.com/article/20140731/NEWS02/307310121 |title=Judge: Man should've known punch could kill soccer ref |date= July 31, 2014   |publisher= [[Detroit Free Press]] |accessdate= November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1690">'''Radical compassion''' is a term coined by the philosopher [[Khen Lampert]], in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Lampert, K., Compassionate Education: Prolegomena for Radical Schooling, University-Press of Amer., 2003; {{ISBN|978-0-7618-2641-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His '''theory of radical compassion''' appeared in ''Traditions of Compassion: from Religious Duty to Social-Activism'' (2006).&lt;ref name="Lampert_2006"&gt;Lampert K., Traditions of Compassion: From Religious Duty to Social Activism, Palgrave-Macmillan, 2006; {{ISBN|978-1-4039-8527-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lampert identifies [[compassion]] as a special case of [[empathy]], directed towards the "other's" distress. Radical compassion is a specific type of general compassion, which includes the inner imperative to change reality in order to alleviate the pain of others. This state of mind, according to Lampert's theory, is universal, and stands at the root of the historical cry for social change.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I have noted that compassion, especially in its radical form, manifests itself as an impulse. This manifestation stands in stark opposition to the underlying premises of the Darwinist theories, which regard the survival instinct as determining human behavior, as well to the Freudian logic of the Pleasure Principle, which refutes any supposedly natural tendency on the part of human beings to act against their own interests and proposes viewing such an inclination as the product of cultural conditioning..."&lt;ref name="Lampert_2006"/&gt;{{rp|160}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Reproductive suppression''' involves the prevention or inhibition of [[reproduction]] in otherwise healthy adult individuals.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wasser | first1 = S.K. | last2 = Barash | first2 = D.P | year = 1983 | title = Reproductive suppression among female mammals: implicaitons for biomedicine and sexual selection theory | url = | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 58 | issue = 4| pages = 513–538 | doi=10.1086/413545}}  Quote is from p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes delayed sexual maturation ([[puberty]]) or inhibition of sexual receptivity, facultatively increased interbirth interval through delayed or inhibited [[ovulation]] or spontaneous or induced abortion, abandonment of immature and dependent offspring,  mate guarding, selective destruction and [[worker policing]] of eggs in some [[Eusociality|eusocial]] insects  or cooperatively breeding birds, and [[infanticide]] (see also [[infanticide (zoology)]]), and [[infanticide in carnivores]]) of the offspring of subordinate females either by directly killing by dominant females or males in mammals  or indirectly through the withholding of assistance with infant care in [[marmoset]]s and some carnivores.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;Saltzman, W., Leidl, K.J., Salper, O.J., Pick, R.R., Abbott, D.H.

The ''Reproductive Suppression Model'' argues that "females can optimize their lifetime [[reproductive success]] by suppressing reproduction when future [physical or social] conditions for the survival of offspring are likely to be greatly improved over present ones".&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; When intragroup competition (competition between individuals belonging to the same group) is high it may be beneficial to suppress the reproduction of others, and for subordinate females to suppress their own reproduction until a later time when social competition is reduced. This leads to reproductive skew within a social group, with some individuals having more offspring than others. The cost of reproductive suppression to the individual is lowest at the earliest stages of a reproductive event and reproductive suppression is often easiest to induce at the pre-ovulatory or earliest stages of pregnancy in mammals, and greatest after a birth. Therefore, [[Neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrine]] cues for assessing reproductive success should evolve to be reliable at early stages in the ovulatory cycle.
Reproductive suppression occurs in its most extreme form in eusocial insects such as termites, hornets and bees and the mammalian [[naked mole rat]] which depend on a complex division of labor within the group for survival and in which specific genes, epigenetics and other factors are known to determine whether individuals will permanently be unable to breed or able to reach reproductive maturity under particular social conditions,&lt;ref name=ref4&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Korb | first1 = J. | last2 = Weil | first2 = T. | last3 = Hoffman | first3 = K. | last4 = Foster | first4 = K.R. | last5 = Rehli | first5 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A gene necessary for reproductive suppression in termites | url = | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5928| page = 758 | doi=10.1126/science.1170660 | pmid=19423819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref5&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jarosch | first1 = A. | last2 = Stole | first2 = E. | last3 = Crewe | last4 = Moritz | first4 = R.F.A. | year = 2011 | title = Alternative splicing of a single transcription factor drives selfish reproductive behavior in honeybee workers (''Apis mellifera'') | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 108 | issue = 37| pages = 15282–15287 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1109343108| pmid = 21896748 | pmc = 3174643 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref6&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Faulkes | first1 = C.G. | last2 = Bennet | first2 = N.C. | year = 2001 | title = Family values: group dynamics and social control of reproduction in African mole-rates | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 184–190 | doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02116-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cooperatively breeding fish, birds and mammals in which a [[breeding pair]] depends on helpers whose reproduction is suppressed for the survival of their own offspring.&lt;ref name=ref7&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koenig | first1 = W.D. | last2 = Mumme | first2 = R.L. | last3 = Stanback | last4 = Pitelka | first4 = F.A. | year = 1995 | title = Patterns and consequences of egg destruction among joint-nesting acorn woodpeckers | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 607–621 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80123-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref8&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hradecky | first1 = P | year = 1985 | title = Possible pheromonal regulation of reproduction in wild carnivores | doi = 10.1007/BF00988206 | pmid = 24309850 | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 241–250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref9&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Creel | first1 = S.R. | last2 = Creel | first2 = N.M. | year = 1991 | title = Energetics, reproductive suppression and obligate communal breeding in carnivores | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 263–270 | doi=10.1007/bf00175099}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref10&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Doolan | first1 = S.P. | last2 = MacDonald | first2 = D.W. | year = 1997 | title = Band structure and failures of reproductive suppression in a cooperatively breeding carnivore, the slender-tailed meerkat (''Suricata suricatta'') | url = | journal = Behaviour | volume = 134 | issue = 11| pages = 827–848 | doi=10.1163/156853997x00179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref11&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garber | first1 = P.A. | year = 1997 | title = One for all and breeding for one: cooperation and competition as a tamarin reproductive strategy | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 187–199 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6505(1997)5:6&lt;187::aid-evan1&gt;3.0.co;2-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref12&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clutton-Brock | first1 = T.H. | last2 = Brotherton | first2 = P.N.M. | last3 = Smith | first3 = R.

==Pre-fertilization mechanisms of reproductive suppression==

===Environmental cues===

====Food shortages (resource availability)====
Female mammals experience delays in the onset of puberty or increase their interbirth intervals in response to environmental conditions that are associated with low abundance and poor quality of foods. Nutritional stress is apparently linked to the female endocrine system and ovulatory [[Pheromone|pheromonal]] cycle. For example, [[Orangutan]]s (''Pongo pygmaeus'') experience high [[ketone]] (due to fat burning) and low [[estrogen]] levels during times of low food availability and poor food quality, but low ketone and high estrogen levels that stimulates onset of the ovulation during the fruit masting seasons that occurs about every four years on Sumatra.&lt;ref name=ref18&gt;Knott, Cheryl 1998 Orangutans in the wild. National Geographic August 1998. http://www.timlaman.com/#/national-geographic-articles/98Aug-Orangutans&lt;/ref&gt;[18]  Since adult female orangutans are solitary, interference by other females can be ruled out as influencing their temporary reproductive suppression and facultatively long interbirth intervals.  [[Polygynandrous]] [[yellow baboon]]s (''Papio cynocephalus'') in Kenya were far less likely to ovulate or conceive during periods of drought or extreme heat, especially if they live in large groups, resulting in longer interbirth intervals during periods of nutritional and thermal stress.&lt;ref name=ref19&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beehner | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Onderdonk | first2 = D.A. | last3 = Alberts | first3 = S.C. | last4 = Altmann | first4 = J. | year = 2006 | title = The ecology of conception and pregnancy failure in wild baboons | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 741–750 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arl006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref20&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beehner | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Lu | first2 = A. | year = 2013 | title = Reproductive suppression in female primates: a review | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 226–238 | doi=10.1002/evan.21369| pmid = 24166923 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High population density====
High population density is one of the environmental factors that can lead to reproductive suppression. When population density is high, subordinate individuals may experience reproductive suppression that they would not have experiences otherwise. For example, when high numbers of yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus) females are simultaneously in estrous at Mikumi National Park, Tanzania dominant females form coalitions that attack subordinate females, leading to a disruption in their reproductive cycle and failure to conceive.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; This places constraints on the number of offspring born in a single generation. Since infant mortality in Amboseli yellow baboons depends in part on the number and ages of other infants born into the group, pre-ovulatory females that are most susceptible to stress-induced delay or inhibition of ovulation are the most frequent targets of female coalition attacks. Female attackers are often in advanced stages of pregnancy, and have the most to lose if the number of infants in the group reaches an unsustainable level. A similar study of [[Chacma baboon]]s (''Papio ursinus'') noted high levels of female-female aggression around the mating season when the number of ovulating females was high (indicated by sexual swellings) and that aggression directed toward suppressing the mating opportunities of ovulating females.&lt;ref name=ref21&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huchard | first1 = E. | last2 = Cowlishaw | first2 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Female-female aggression around mating: an extra cost of sociality in a multimale primate society | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 1003–1011 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arr083}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among [[elephant seal]]s (Mirounga) high neonatal mortality occurs when the number of pups born in a season is high, with deaths resulting from injury and starvation.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; To counteract loss of their pups elephant seals conceive next year's offspring immediately after giving birth to this year's young, but delay implantation for 4 months. Female striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) in monogamous social groups do not experience reproductive suppression, but those living in communally breeding groups with high population density and large numbers of old breeding females do.&lt;ref name=ref16 /&gt;

===Social cues===

====Stress induced by aggression from dominant to subordinate individuals====
Chronic physiological stress resulting from aggression by dominant toward subordinate individuals is thought to be a major cause of delayed maturation and suppressed ovulation in subordinate individuals of a wide range of species.&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref22&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowman | first1 = L. | last2 = Dilley | first2 = S.R. | last3 = Keverne | first3 = E.B. | year = 1978 | title = Suppression of oestrogen-induced LH surges by social subordination in talapoin monkeys | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 275 | issue = 5675| pages = 56–58 | doi=10.1038/275056a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref23&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnold | first1 = W. | last2 = Dittami | first2 = J. | year = 1997 | title = Reproductive suppression in male alpine marmots | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 53–66 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1996.0277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref24&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hacklander | first1 = K. | last2 = Mostl | first2 = E | last3 = Arnold | first3 = W. | year = 2003 | title = Reproductive suppression in female Alpine marmots (Marmota marmot) | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 65 | issue = 6| pages = 1133–1140 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2003.2159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to stress the HPA axis (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis) is activated, producing high concentrations of circulating adrenal glucocorticoids (GC) which, when chronically present, negatively influence an animal's health and can lead to reproductive suppression in male [[marmot]]s (''Marmota marmota''), and blocks of ovulatory cycles of female talapoin monkeys (''Miopithecus talapoin''), meerkats (''Suricata suricatta'') and marmots.&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref22 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref23 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref24 /&gt;

In [[cooperative breeding|cooperatively breeding]] meerkats (Suricata suricatta) the dominant breeding female is the oldest and heaviest female who is highly aggressive toward subordinate females during the [[breeding season]] and temporarily evicts subordinate females from the group.&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt; Evicted subordinates suffer repeated attacks during the later stages of the breeding female's pregnancy and showed GC levels two times higher than normal. Approximately 3 days after their birth, subordinate females return to the group to help rear the breeding female's pups, at which time the dominant female is no longer aggressive toward them. By inducing the stress response in subordinates the breeding female disrupts the ovulatory cycle and prevents mating of the subordinate females, or causes the pregnancies of subordinates to fail if they do occur. If her social group is small the breeding female evicts all subordinate females, but if it is large she targets older females, pregnant females and non-kin.&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt;

However, reproductive suppression through stress does not apply to many species including orangutans for which subordinate males have lower GC levels than dominant ones,&lt;ref name=ref25&gt;Maggioncalda, A.N. &amp; Sapolsky, R.M.

====Pheromonal suppression by breeding female====
Pheromonal suppression of subordinate male and female reproduction is implicated as the mechanism by which dominant breeding pairs suppress the reproduction of non-breeders in communally and cooperatively breeding species, especially in the absence of stress as an explanation.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt; Wolves (''Canis lupus''), coyotes (''Canis latrons'') and hunting dogs ''(Lycaon pictus'') live in packs with a dominant breeding pair that does most of the territorial urine [[scent marking]] in the group. During the breeding season the dominant male urinates over the dominant female's urine, possibly to hide the female's reproductive status from other males. Pheromones in urine are implicated as a possible mechanism to shut down the subordinate's reproductive cycle. Only the dominant pair mate and have young, producing one litter per year. Subordinate females either do not exhibit estrous hormonal changes or they occur irregularly. Occasionally a subordinate animal leaves the pack and forms a new mating pair when it then exhibits of the territorial urine marking and mating behavior that was suppressed when living in the presence of the dominant breeding pair.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;

Yellow, banded and dwarf mongooses live in families similar to wolf packs with scent marking  done almost exclusively by the dominant pair. Dwarf mongooses show synchronous estrous but only the dominant female regularly gives birth.  Subordinate females do not conceive or abort early, but do lactate after the dominant female gives birth and participate in communal nursing. When the subordinate females leave the parental pack they will become fully reproductively active in new groups they help establish. In captivity more than one dwarf mongoose in a group can give birth but the young of subordinates do not survive. However, if the size of their cage is increased and density is lower, reproductive activity of subordinates resumes. As in wolves, pheromonal control over the reproductive cycle of the mongoose is implicated as the mechanism for reproductive suppression.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;
The house mouse (''Mus musculus'') is territorial with a single dominant male marking its territorial boundary with urine while subordinate males do not urine mark.&lt;ref name=ref30&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bronson | first1 = F.H. | year = 1979 | title = The reproductive ecology of the house mouse | url = | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 265–299 | doi=10.1086/411295}}&lt;/ref&gt; A female's rate of urine marking is elevated in response to a dominant male's urine marking, and his urine contains pheromones that accelerate her ovulation.  The presence of a dominant adult male and his urine are crucial for young females to initiate puberty.  Females isolated from males often do not experience puberty or have unstable ovulatory cycles. Contact with the urine of a dominant female signals a young prepubescent female to delay the onset of puberty. When housed with only an adult male, female mice reach puberty within 25 days, but puberty will not occur until 40–50 days if they are housed with adult females. Being grouped with other females suppresses the young female's serum LH and prolactin. Exposure to the male elevates their LH levels followed by increased serum estradiol. Female mice have a short ovulatory cycle when housed with males and a long cycle when housed with only other females.&lt;ref name=ref30 /&gt;

Queen pheromones are among the most important chemical messages regulating insect societies but are yet to be isolated.&lt;ref name="ref31"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holman | first1 = L. | last2 = Lanfear | first2 = R. | last3 = d'Ettorre | first3 = P. | year = 2013 | title = The evolution of queen pheromones in the ant genus Lasius | url = | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 26 | issue = 7| pages = 1549–1558 | doi=10.1111/jeb.12162| pmid = 23662630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  in natural colonies of the Saxon wasp, ''Dolichovespula saxonica'', queens emit reliable chemical cues of their true fertility, but as the queen's signals decrease incidences of worker reproduction increases.&lt;ref name="ref32"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Zweden | first1 = J.S. | last2 = Bonckaert | first2 = W. | last3 = Wenseleers | first3 = T. | last4 = d'Ettorre | first4 = P | year = 2013 | title = Queen signaling in social wasps | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 68 | issue = 4| pages = 976–986 | doi=10.1111/evo.12314| pmid = 24219699 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In colonies of ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'', the queen can control oogenesis and worker egg laying by regulating concentrations of juvenile hormone (JH) in workers. This is likely achieved through queen pheromones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roseler, P. F.  | year= 1977 | title = Juvenile hormone control of oogenesis in bumblebee workers, ''B. terrestris'' | journal = Journal of Insect Physiology | volume = 23 | issue= 8 | pages = 985–992 | doi=10.1016/0022-1910(77)90126-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social self-inhibition hypothesis====
Game theory is employed to suggest that subordinates suppress their own reproduction to avoid the social cost imposed on them if they reproduce, including expulsion from the group and infanticide against their progeny by dominant breeding individuals.&lt;ref name=ref28 /&gt; Forced dispersal from the group may be extremely dangerous, involving high levels of predation and difficulty finding food and sleeping sites.  In the absence of stress or pheromones as a mechanism, a "self-inhibition"model was proposed that suggests subordinates can choose to inhibit their own reproduction in cooperatively breeding groups in order to remain flexible and share in the group's productivity. When group members are closely related, independent breeding opportunities are poor, and detection of mating and pregnancy is high, subordinates choose to suppress their own reproduction.&lt;ref name=ref28 /&gt;
The self-inhibition model has been applied to female common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). When they are introduced into a new group, female marmosets are immediately subordinate, experience a drop in chrorionic gonadotrophin (CG) and within the first four days and stops ovulating.&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref33&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abbott | first1 = D.H. | last2 = Saltzman | first2 = W. | last3 = Schultz-Darken | first3 = N.J. | last4 = Smith | first4 = T.E. | year = 1997 | title = Specific neuroendocrine mechanisms not involving generalized stress mediate social regulation of female reproduction in cooperatively breeding marmoset mankeys | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 219–238 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb51923.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subordinate female ovaries are smaller than dominants and secrete little estrogen.&lt;ref name=ref33 /&gt; Older female marmosets are less subject to ovulatory self-restraint and the scent of an unfamiliar dominant female does not affect their ovulation. However, continued exposure to the dominant female may represent a social, rather than biological, cue that causes the subordinates to shut down their ovulation.&lt;ref name=ref33 /&gt;

===Mate guarding===
[[File:Yellow mongoose 1.jpg|thumb|Yellow mongoose 1]]
Limiting access to reproductive partners through mate guarding is a form of reproductive suppression. In the banded mongoose (Mungus mungo) the oldest males have the most offspring. Yet mating in this species is highly promiscuous.&lt;ref name=ref34&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nichols | first1 = H.J. | last2 = Amos | first2 = W. | last3 = Cant | first3 = M.A. | last4 = Bell | first4 = M.B.V. | last5 = Hodge | first5 = S.J. | year = 2010 | title = Top males gain high reproductive success by guarding more successful females in a cooperatively breeding mongoose | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 80 | issue = 4| pages = 649–657 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.06.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older males increase their reproductive success by mate guarding the oldest most fertile females since they cannot guard all the females in the group.&lt;ref name=ref34 /&gt; Therefore, successfully breeding older males are highly selective in their mate guarding and exert mate selection. Mate guarding is also a mechanism of reproductive suppression of subordinates in mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) in which males over the age of 8 mate-guard, with alpha males performing 94% of the mate-guarding and being responsible for siring 69% of the offspring.&lt;ref name=ref35&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Setchell | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Charpentier | first2 = M. | last3 = Wickings | first3 = J. | year = 2005 | title = Mate guarding and paternity in mandrills: factors influencing alpha male monopoly | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 70 | issue = 5| pages = 1105–1120 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.02.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic determinism of reproductive despotism - eusocial insects and the naked mole rat with suppression at birth===
[[Eusociality|Also known as eusociality]]Ovary activation in honeybee workers is inhibited by pheromones from the queen.&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt; In the Cape honeybee social parasites that are of the worker caste enter the colony and kill the resident queen, activate their own ovaries and parthenogenetically produce diploid female offspring (thelytoky) – behaviors that are all linked to a single locus on chromosome 13.  The parasites produced queen-like  pheromones falsely signally the presence of a queen suppressing the reproduction of worker's native to the colony and policing or destroying these eggs.&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt; Alternative slicing of a gene homologous to the gemini transcription factor of Drosophila controls worker sterility. Knocking out an exon resulted in rapid worker ovary activation. A 9 nucleotide deletion from the normal altruistic worker genome may turn a honeybee into a parasite.&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt;
As for many eusocial insects, termite workers are totipotent and rarely produce offspring although they are capable of reproduction when the breeding pair dies. Researchers hypothesized that the gene Neofem2, which is involved in cockroach communication, plays a critical role in queen-worker communication. They experimentally took the king or queen out of the colony. Some workers displayed pre-mating head butting behavior and can go on to become reproductive while others did not. However, when the Neofem2 gene was suppressed butting behavior did not occur, indicating that the gene is essential in allowing the queen to suppress worker reproduction.&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt; Neofem2 may play a role in cockroach egg pheromones.&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt;

Helping to rear the dominant females young may be the only way they can ensure an individual's survival.

==Post-fertilization mechanisms==

===Destruction of eggs including worker policing===
Destroying eggs such that only one female's eggs survive is documented in cooperatively breeding birds such as acorn woodpeckers (''Melanerpes formicivorus'').&lt;ref name=ref7 /&gt; About 25% of acorn woodpecker groups contain two or more joint-nesting females that cooperate to raise young, but cooperative female destroy each other's eggs prior to laying their own. These eggs are eaten by other members of the group, including the mother.
In Cape honeybees (''Apis mellifera capensis'') the multiple mating of the queen and existence of half-siblings creates sub-families within the colony. Sometimes the queen fails to control worker reproduction. In response workers remove eggs laid by other workers leading to less than 1% of offspring being worker laid.&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt; Worker Policing of worker eggs occurs in the European hornet (Vespa crabo) honeybees and wasps.&lt;ref name=ref36&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foster | first1 = K.R. | last2 = Gulliver | first2 = J. | last3 = Ratneiks | first3 = F.L.W. | year = 2002 | title = Worker policing in the European hornet Vespa crabro | url = | journal = Insectes Soc. | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 41–44 | doi=10.1007/s00040-002-8277-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref37&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foster | first1 = K.R. | last2 = Ratnieks | first2 = F.L.W. | year = 2001 | title = Convergent evolution of worker policing by egg eating in the honeybee and common wasp | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 268 | issue = 1463| pages = 169–174 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1346| pmc = 1088587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spontaneous abortion===
Social stress and resource limitation can lead to high rates of spontaneous abortion as a mechanism of reproductive suppression. Meerkats subordinate females that have conceived prior to being evicted from the group by the breeding female during the breeding season fail to carry their pregnancies as a result of increased stress (higher GC levels) and reduced access to food and other resources.&lt;ref name=ref12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt; Evicted females regularly copulate with males from neighboring groups Subordinate females have low conception rates and increased abortion rates in response to low food availability and high predation risk.&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt; Dwarf mongooses show synchronous estrous but only the dominant female regularly bears young. If subordinate females do manage to conceive they abort the pregnancy.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;

===Infanticide in cooperatively breeding species of subordinate offspring by the breeding female===
[[Infanticide (zoology)|Infanticide]] is a mechanism of reproductive success that occurs in many species. Alpha female dwarf mongooses and African wild dogs kill offpring other than their own, but alpha males do not use infanticide to enforce reproductive suppression.&lt;ref name=ref27 /&gt; This may occur because the breeding alpha may have sired a rare subordinate's offspring. Subordinate females time their rare pregnancies such that they give birth several days after the alpha female to reduce the risk of infanticide.
Pregnant suborordinate meerkats are known to kill the pups of the dominant breeding female.&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt; No dominant female pups have ever been observed killed after their 4th day of life. Evicted subordinate females are kept out for 3 days after the breeding female gave birth.
Eight infanticides involving the killing of a subordinate female's offspring by the breeding female have been observed in wild common marmosets, as well as two instances of infanticide in which the subordinate female bred and then killed the  breeding female's babies.&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt;  Infanticidal marmoset females are often in the last trimester of pregnancy, but postpartum females don't commit infanticide.

===Brood parasitism and quasi-parasitism in birds===
[[File:Senegal Coucal -Centropus senegalensis -on tree.jpg|thumb|Senegal Coucal - ''Centropus senegalensis'' - on tree]]
[[Brood parasite|Brood parasitism]] is the process by which a female lays her eggs in a conspecific female's nest. Parasitic female moorhens (Gallinula chloropus) are known to lay one to six eggs in their neighbor's nests.&lt;ref name=ref40&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McRae | first1 = S. B. | last2 = Burke | first2 = T. | year = 1996 | title = Intraspecific brood parasitism in the moorhen: parentage and parasite-host relationships determined by DNA fingerprinting | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 115–129 | doi=10.1007/s002650050224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases the male paired with the conspecific female has been involved in extra-pair copulations with the parasitic mother. This causes maternity uncertainty for the female as not all species can readily identify their own eggs from another's, which imposes fitness costs of raising an offspring that is not her own. In some cases females will lay eggs in another's nest that were conceived by another male entirely. This process is known as quasi-parasitism and induces fitness costs on both the male and female of the parasitized nest who cannot be certain of paternity or maternity. This is a problem for white-fronted bee-eaters (Merops bullockoides), where it has been found through analysis of enzyme polymorphisms that approximately 9–12% of offspring are unrelated to one parent or none.&lt;ref name=ref41&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wrege | first1 = P. H. | last2 = Emlen | first2 = S. T. | year = 1987 | title = Biochemical determination of parental uncertainty in white-fronted bee-eaters | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 153–160 | doi=10.1007/bf00299728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reproductive strategy of brood-parasitism is not only an intraspecies problem, as parasitic mothers will use the nests of one to 240 different host species.&lt;ref name=ref42&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lanyon | first1 = S. M. | year = 1992 | title = Interspecific brood parasitism in blackbirds (''Icterinae''): A phylogenetic perspective | url = | journal = Science | volume = 255 | issue = 5040| pages = 77–79 | doi=10.1126/science.1553533}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fitness costs that these interactions impose strains on host parents to displace time, effort, and resources into offspring that are not their own, and are believed to reduce the hosts reproductive success by up to 50%.&lt;ref name=ref43&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Langmore | first1 = N. E. | last2 = Hunt | first2 = S. | last3 = Kilner | first3 = R. M. | year = 2003 | title = Escalation of a coevolutionary arms race through host rejection of brood parasitic young | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 422 | issue = 6928| pages = 157–160 | doi=10.1038/nature01460 | pmid=12634784}}&lt;/ref&gt; But time lost is not the greatest cost to some host species. Hosts that raise Cuculus and Chrysococcyx cuckoos lose all their offspring as the cuckoos kill them with mandibular hooks.&lt;ref name=ref44&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = N. B. | last2 = Bourke | first2 = A. F. | last3 = de L Brooke | first3 = M. | year = 1989 | title = Cuckoos and parasitic ants: interspecific brood parasitism as an evolutionary arms race | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 4 | issue = 9| pages = 274–278 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(89)90202-4| pmid = 21227369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some other species do not directly kill a hosts' young, they often kill them indirectly through competition for food leading to eventual starvation.&lt;ref name=ref44 /&gt; 
Why then do host species tolerate parasitic offspring? Several hypotheses have been tested to answer this question. One theory known as the quasi-parasitism hypothesis suggested that parasitic females were exchanging extra-pair copulations with host males for access to lay their eggs in the nest. This theory was denounced by DNA fingerprinting revealing that many offspring were sired by only the parasitic mother's mate and not the mate of the host female.&lt;ref name=ref40 /&gt; Another theory was that this interaction fell under kin selection, and that perhaps the parasites and hosts were closely related and there was an inclusive fitness benefit to hosts. While this theory has not been completely denounced in some species like moorhens, it does not fully explain why then interspecific parasitism perseveres.&lt;ref name=ref40 /&gt; The most widely accepted hypothesis is that hosts are deceived and cannot differentiate their own eggs or offspring. The deception model explains a coevolutionary arms race between hosts and parasites that has led to further adaptations in deception and host parasitism defense strategies. Parasitic cuckoos have developed a system for potentially successful parasitism by quickly laying a small mimetic egg during the hosts' laying period.&lt;ref name=ref44 /&gt; Some parasitic mothers go as far to eject the eggs of hosts before laying their own eggs in the nest, which has been suggested to increase the efficiency of which their eggs are incubated and raised, all the while providing them with a meal in the process.&lt;ref name=ref44 /&gt; Brood parasitism has been shown to be a coevolutionary arms race between hosts and parasites with new adaptations of egg recognition being selected for in hosts, and new strategies of trickery and deception being selected for in parasites to exploit hosts.&lt;ref name=ref43 /&gt;

'''Samuel Bagnall''' (6 February 1892 – 1946) was an English [[association football|footballer]] who played for [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield Town]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. Playing [[outside right]], he was known for his pace, being described as a "better sprinter than a footballer."&lt;ref name="blades whos who"&gt;{{cite book|author=Denis Clarebrough &amp; Andrew Kirkham|title=Sheffield United Who's Who|publisher=Hallamshire Press|year=2008|page=38|isbn=978-1-874718-69-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
Born in [[Neepsend]], [[Sheffield]], Bagnall made his breakthrough at nearby [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield Town]] but was quickly transferred to his home-town club [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for a fee of £152 in April 1913 (although the Blades later informed the Football League that the fee had been £350.)&lt;ref name="blades whos who" /&gt; He also ran sprint events, winning the sprint at the 1913 Players' Union Sports competition.&lt;ref name="telegraph1914"/&gt;

Despite commanding a large fee for the time he failed to make an impact on the first team at [[Bramall Lane]], making only seven appearances in just over a season before he was released at the outset of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="blades whos who" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Bagnall saw active service during the war, being wounded in his left shoulder and arm while serving in France, and was subsequently discharged in 1916. It was initially feared he would be permanently disabled, but he recovered enough to take up a job at Welbeck Colliery and played for [[Welbeck Welfare F.C.|their football team]].&lt;ref name="blades whos who" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sam Bagnall|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001914/19161216/009/0002|accessdate=8 August 2017|work=[[Sheffield Star Green 'Un]]|date=16 December 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, he took part in a charity footrace at [[Hyde Park, Sheffield|Hyde Park]], organised by the Park Ex-Serviceman to raise funds for a new sports pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Footballer–Pedestrians – Well-Known Players to Compete at Hyde Park Gala|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001914/19210416/106/0006|accessdate=8 August 2017|work=[[Sheffield Star Green 'Un]]|date=16 April 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sarkoy''' are the people of the planet [[Sarkovy]], featured in ''[[Star King]]'' and ''[[The Palace of Love]]'', two of the [[Demon Princes]] novels of [[Jack Vance]]. Sarkoy mainly inhabit the steppes of their somewhat bleak and unforgiving planet.

==Habits and customs==
Sarkoy have a highly formalised and structured society and place great value upon etiquette. A breach of certain manners may earn a death sentence; "dishonouring a fetish" is one such crime and "throwing sour milk upon his grandmother" is another (both offences quoted in [[The Palace of Love]]). The cruelty of the Sarkoy can be judged by the popularity of the sport of ''harbite'', in which the ''harikap'', a semi-intelligent animal, is tormented to death in a number of imaginative ways including being set on fire. (When [[Kirth Gersen]] ironically enquires of [[Star King#Sivij Suthiro|Sivij Suthiro]] what the Sarkoy will do for entertainment when they have exterminated the ''harikap'', Suthiro responds blandly that they always have each other.)

==The Sarkoy poisoners==
Their most notable characteristic is that practically every inhabitant of the planet is skilled to a greater or lesser degree in the art of assassination by poison. An adept of this art is known as a '''venefice''' and it is rumoured that a Master Venefice can kill his quarry merely by walking past him. This may be an exaggeration, but perhaps not a flagrant one. Many venefices pride themselves on their ability to develop poisons out of substances previously considered harmless, and an expert can transmit toxins or plague germs on contact, even a contact so slight as to go unnoticed. A skilled venefice typically keeps his fingernails hardened and sharpened such that they can cut paper at a touch (in order to deliver subcutaneous poison); a still more skilled practitioner can poison one merely by passing him paper to show off this 'paper trick'.

In ''[[The Palace of Love]]'' Master Edelrod explains to [[Kirth Gersen]] that to avoid this fate a venefice will try to acquire immunity to the poisons that may be used against him and also exercises great caution in all his personal dealings (going so far as pre-emptively poisoning any rivals). In this way he will "live to become an old man" (a Sarkoy expression).

A trade Guild exists to regulate the trafficking of poisons and act as a professional body for the venefices. Breaking its rules is a serious matter and the offender may be sentenced to "cooperate" with the Guild, whereby other Guild members test new poisons upon the unfortunate (see ''[[The Palace of Love]]'' for an example: the offender had sold fixed-rate poison at a discount).

==Cluthe==
Referred to several times in the series, the poisonous or infective agent known as ''cluthe'' is one of the most famous and dreaded substances at the venefice's disposal. Tristano the Earthman, when beaten by Gersen in a fight, is willing to stand physical torture and permanent maiming and disfigurement rather than spill secrets and be put to death by cluthe (as Suthiro would be ordered to kill him). Other opponents whom Gersen encounters readily agree to inform on their employer merely on the understanding that Gersen will kill them by shooting rather than by cluthe.

It is not quite consistent in either its application or its effects on the two occasions that Gersen himself uses it; in ''Star King'', Gersen induces Suthiro to accept a piece of paper from him and uses the opportunity to infect him with cluthe (whether by an imperceptible touch of his own or by contaminating the paper is not clear), whereas in ''The Face'', he kills Lens Larque by slapping him with a cluthe-laced glove. Larque dies within minutes, racked by hideous internal and external convulsions, whereas Suthiro exhibits no effects whatever until meeting Gersen a day later, though his exceedingly rapid decline thereafter suggests that he had failed to notice that he was ill, possibly on account of his arrogant assumption that no-one could have poisoned him.

While visiting Sarkovy in ''The Palace of Love'', Gersen is advised to restock his supplies of cluthe, as when not fresh it is merely debilitating or even inconveniencing and not fatal.

Other poisons mentioned include alpha, beta, black-tox, furux, mervan, tox meratis, twitus, ulgar, and vole.

==Religion==
Sarkoy generally worship Godogma, who carries a flower and a flail and walks on wheels. Evidently he is viewed as one who gathers the souls of the dead, and the Sarkoy view death with apparent fatalism; however, when Kirth Gersen remarks to Suthiro that "One never likes to hasten Godogma", Suthiro agrees and remarks that on Sarkoy there are a thousand popular aphorisms to this effect.

==Gersen's association with the Sarkoy==
During a visit to the planet, Gersen displays a familiarity with and tolerant acceptance of Sarkovy's unlovely customs. He also has friends in high places, as the mere mention of a venefice named Coudirou is enough to open doors for him. Most probably this is because Coudirou is enough of a master of his craft to kill anyone who crosses him, and the other Sarkoy naturally assume that Gersen would never dare to drop his name casually unless he really did know him well. The previous mention of Coudirou in ''Star King'' implied that Gersen was at some point a student of his, and Gersen himself is no slouch as a poisoner.

'''Semelparity''' and '''iteroparity''' are two classes of possible reproductive strategies available to living organisms.  A species is considered semelparous if it is characterized by a single reproductive episode before death, and iteroparous if it is characterized by multiple reproductive cycles over the course of its lifetime.  Some [[Botany|botanists]] use the parallel terms [[monocarpy]] and [[polycarpy]]. (See also [[plietesials]].)

In truly semelparous species, death after reproduction is part of an overall strategy that includes putting all available resources into maximizing reproduction, at the expense of future life (see "[[#Trade-offs|Trade-offs]]", below). In any iteroparous population there will be some individuals who die between their first and second reproductive episodes, but unless this is part of a syndrome of programmed death after reproduction, this would not be called semelparity.

This distinction is also related to the difference between [[annual plant|annual]] and [[perennial plant|perennial]] plants.  An annual is a plant that completes its life cycle in a single season, and is usually semelparous. Perennials live for more than one season and are usually (but not always) iteroparous.&lt;ref&gt;Gotelli, Nicholas J. (2008). ''A Primer of Ecology.'' Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-87893-318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semelparity and iteroparity are not, strictly speaking, alternative strategies, but extremes along a continuum of possible modes of reproduction. Many organisms considered to be semelparous can, under certain conditions, separate their single bout of reproduction into two or more episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Facultative Second Oviposition as an Adaptation to Egg Loss in a Semelparous Crab Spider|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01126.x/abstract|journal = Ethology|date = 2005-12-01|issn = 1439-0310|pages = 1126–1138|volume = 111|issue = 12|doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01126.x|first = Kyoko|last = Futami|first2 = Shin-ichi|last2 = Akimoto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changing reproductive effort within a semelparous reproductive episode|url = http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/8/1323|journal = American Journal of Botany|date = 2014-08-01|issn = 0002-9122|pmid = 25156981|pages = 1323–1331|volume = 101|issue = 8|doi = 10.3732/ajb.1400283|first = P.

==Overview==

===Semelparity===

[[File:Oncorhynchus nerka 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Oncorhynchus|Pacific salmon]] is an example of a semelparous organism]]The word semelparity was coined by evolutionary biologist Lamont Cole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cole|first=Lamont C.|title=The Population Consequences of Life History Phenomena|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=June 1954|volume=29|issue=2|pages=103–137|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2817654?uid=3739920&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102442342007|accessdate=June 22, 2013|doi=10.1086/400074}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comes from the Latin ''semel'' 'once, a single time' and ''pario'' 'to beget'. This differs from&amp;nbsp;iteroparity&amp;nbsp;in that iteroparous species are able to have multiple reproductive cycles and therefore can mate more than once in their lifetime. Semelparity is also known as "big bang" reproduction, since the single reproductive event of semelparous organisms is usually large as well as fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Ricklefs and Gary Leon Miller (1999). ''Ecology.'' Macmillan {{ISBN|0-7167-2829-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A classic example of a semelparous organism is Pacific salmon (''[[Oncorhynchus]]'' spp.), which lives for many years in the ocean before swimming to the freshwater stream of its birth, spawning, and dying. Other semelparous animals include many insects, including some species of butterflies, cicadas, and [[mayfly|mayflies]], many [[arachnids]], and some molluscs such as some species of [[squid]] and [[octopus]].

Semelparity also occurs in [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]] and [[capelin]], but is very rare in vertebrates other than bony fish.

This form of lifestyle is consistent with&amp;nbsp;[[R/K selection theory|r-selected]]&amp;nbsp;strategies as many offspring are produced and there is low parental input, as one or both parents die after mating.

===Iteroparity===

[[File:Sow with piglet.jpg|thumb| An iteroparous organism is one that can undergo many reproductive events throughout its lifetime. The [[pig]] is an example of an iteroparous organism]]The term iteroparity comes from the Latin ''itero'', to repeat, and ''pario'', to beget.  An example of an iteroparous organism is a human—though people may choose to have only one child (or even none), humans are biologically capable of having offspring many times over the course of their lives.

Iteroparous vertebrates include all birds, most reptiles, virtually all mammals, and most fish. Among invertebrates, most mollusca and many insects (for example, mosquitoes and cockroaches) are iteroparous.  Most perennial plants are iteroparous.

==Models==

===Trade-offs===
It is a biological precept that within its lifetime an organism has a limited amount of energy/resources available to it, and must always partition it among various functions such as collecting food and finding a mate.  Of relevance here is the trade-off between [[fecundity]], growth, and survivorship in its [[life history theory|life history]] strategy. These trade-offs come into play in the evolution of iteroparity and semelparity.  It has been repeatedly demonstrated that semelparous species produce more offspring in their single fatal reproductive episode than do closely related iteroparous species in any one of theirs.  However, the opportunity to reproduce more than once in a lifetime, and possibly with greater care for the development of offspring produced, can offset this strictly numerical benefit.

===Models based on non-linear trade-offs===

[[File:reproductive effort iteroparous.svg|thumb|right|Iteroparous reproductive effort]]
One class of models that tries to explain the differential evolution of semelparity and iteroparity examines the shape of the trade-off between offspring produced and offspring forgone.  In [[economic]] terms, offspring produced is equivalent to a [[cost-benefit analysis|benefit]] function, while offspring forgone is comparable to a [[cost]] function.  The reproductive effort of an organism—the proportion of energy that it puts into reproducing, as opposed to growth or survivorship—occurs at the point where the distance between offspring produced and offspring forgone is the greatest.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Moorcroft, "Life History Strategies" (lecture, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 9 February 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  The accompanying graph shows the offspring-produced and offspring-forgone curves for an iteroparous organism:  
[[File:reproductive effort semelparous.jpg|thumb|right|Semelparous reproductive effort]]

In the first graph, the [[marginal cost]] of offspring produced is decreasing (each additional offspring is less "expensive" than the average of all previous offspring) and the marginal cost of offspring forgone is increasing.  In this situation, the organism only devotes a portion of its resources to reproduction, and uses the rest of its resources on growth and survivorship so that it can reproduce again in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Roff, Derek A. (1992). ''The Evolution of Life Histories''. Springer {{ISBN|0-412-02391-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is also possible (second graph) for the marginal cost of offspring produced to ''increase'', and for the marginal cost of offspring forgone to decrease.  When this is the case, it is favorable for the organism to reproduce a single time. The organism devotes all of its resources to that one episode of reproduction, so it then dies. This mathematical/graphical model has found only limited quantitative support from nature.

===Bet-hedging models===
A second set of models examines the possibility that iteroparity is a [[Bet-hedging (biology)|hedge]] against unpredictable juvenile survivorship (avoiding putting all one's eggs in one basket).  Again, mathematical models have not found empirical support from real-world systems.  In fact, many semelparous species live in habitats characterized by high (not low) environmental unpredictability, such as deserts and early successional habitats.

===Cole's paradox and demographic models===

The models that have the strongest support from living systems are demographic. In Lamont Cole's classic 1954 paper, he came to the conclusion that: {{Quote|For an annual species, the absolute gain in intrinsic population growth which could be achieved by changing to the perennial reproductive habit would be exactly equivalent to adding one individual to the average litter size.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont C. Cole. "The Population Consequences of Life History Phenomena." ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 29, no. 2 (June 1954): 103-137&lt;/ref&gt;}}
For example, imagine two species—an iteroparous species that has annual litters averaging three offspring each, and a semelparous species that has one litter of four, and then dies.  These two species have the same rate of population growth, which suggests that even a tiny fecundity advantage of one additional offspring would favor the evolution of semelparity. This is known as Cole's paradox.

In his analysis, Cole assumed that there was no mortality of individuals of the iteroparous species, even seedlings. Twenty years later, Charnov and Schaffer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charnov | first1 = E.L. | last2 = Schaffer | first2 = W.M. | year = 1973 | title = Life history consequences of natural selection: Cole's result revisited | url = http://repository.unm.edu/bitstream/1928/1696/2/AN1973.pdf| journal = American Naturalist | volume = 107 | issue = | pages = 791–793 | doi=10.1086/282877}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that reasonable differences in adult and juvenile mortality yield much more reasonable costs of semelparity, essentially solving Cole's paradox.  An even more general demographic model was produced by Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = T.P. | year = 1981 | title = A general model of comparative fecundity for semelparous and iteroparous life histories | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 118 | issue = | pages = 27–36 | doi=10.1086/283798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These demographic models have been more successful than the other models when tested with real-world systems. It has been shown that semelparous species have higher expected adult mortality, making it more economical to put all reproductive effort into the first (and therefore final) reproductive episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = T.P. | year = 1990 | title = The evolution of semelparity in Mount Kenya lobelias | url = | journal = Evolutionary Ecology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 157–171 | doi=10.1007/bf02270913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lesica | first1 = P. | last2 = Young | first2 = T.P. | year = 2005 | title = Demographic model explains life history evolution in Arabis fecunda | url = | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 471–477 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2005.00972.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In Dasyuridae ====

===== Small Dasyuridae =====

[[File:Phascogale calura close.jpg|thumb|''Phascogale calura'']]
Semelparous species of [[Dasyuridae]] are typically small and carnivorous, with the exception of the northern quoll (''[[Northern quoll|Dasyurus hallucatus]]''), which is large. Species with this reproductive strategy include members of the genus&amp;nbsp;''[[Antechinus]],&amp;nbsp;[[Brush-tailed phascogale|Phascogale tapoatafa]]''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''[[Red-tailed phascogale|Phascogale culura]]''. The males of all three groups exhibit similar characteristics that classify them as semelparous. First, all of the males of each species disappear immediately after the mating season. Also, males that are captured and isolated from others live for 2 to 3 years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woolley|first=Patricia|date=1966-01-01|title=Reproduction in Antechinus spp. and other Dasyurid marsupials|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282331976_Reproduction_in_Antechinus_spp_and_other_Dasyurid_marsupials|journal=Symposia of the Zoological Society of London|volume=15|pages=281–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; If these captured males are allowed to mate, they die immediately after the mating season, like those in the wild. Their behavior also changes drastically before and after the mating season. Before mating, males are extremely aggressive and will fight with other males if placed close together. Males that are captured before they are allowed to mate remain aggressive through the winter months. After the mating season, if allowed to mate, males become extremely lethargic and never regain their aggressiveness even if they survive to the next mating season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other changes that occur post-mating include fur degradation and testicular degeneration. During adolescence, male fur is thick and becomes dull and thin after mating, but regains its original condition if the individual manages to survive past the mating season. The fur on the scrotum completely falls off and does not grow back, even if the male survives months after the first mating season. As the marsupial ages, its testicles grow until they reach a peak size and weight at the beginning of the mating season. After the individual mates, the weight and size of the testes and scrotum decrease. They remain small and do not produce&amp;nbsp;[[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]]&amp;nbsp;later in life, if maintained in a laboratory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 1966 Woolley study on&amp;nbsp;''Antechinus spp.''&amp;nbsp;noticed that males were only able to be maintained past mating in the laboratory and no senile males were found in the wild, suggesting that all males die shortly after mating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== Corticosteroid concentration and increased male mortality =====

[[File:Antechinus stuartii.jpg|thumb|''Antechinus stuartii'']]
Studies on&amp;nbsp;''[[Brown antechinus|Antechinus stuartii]]''&amp;nbsp;reveal that male mortality is highly correlated to stress and&amp;nbsp;[[Adrenocortical hormone|andrenocortica]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l activity. The study measured the&amp;nbsp;[[corticosteroid]]&amp;nbsp;concentration in males in the wild, males injected with cortisol, males injected with saline, and females in the wild. While both males and females exhibit high levels of corticosteroid concentration in the wild, this proves fatal only to males due to females having a higher maximum high affinity corticosteroid binding capacity (MCBC).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=A.J.|last2=McDonald|first2=I.R.|last3=Lee|first3=A.K.|title=Stress and mortality in a small marsupial (Antechinus stuartii, Macleay)|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-6480(80)90122-7|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=188–200|doi=10.1016/0016-6480(80)90122-7|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, free corticosteroid in the&amp;nbsp;[[Blood plasma|plasma]]&amp;nbsp;of male&amp;nbsp;''A. stuartii''&amp;nbsp;rises sharply, while it remains constant in females. High levels of free corticosteroid, resulting from mating in wild males and injected cortisol in laboratory males, resulted in&amp;nbsp;[[Peptic ulcer disease|stomach ulcers]],&amp;nbsp;[[Gastrointestinal bleeding|gastrointestinal hemorrhaging]], and&amp;nbsp;[[liver abscess]]es, all of which increased mortality. These side effects were not found in the males that were injected with saline,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; strengthening the hypothesis that high free corticosteroids results in higher morality in male&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurids''. A similar study on&amp;nbsp;''Phascogale calura''&amp;nbsp;showed that similar&amp;nbsp;[[endocrine system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;changes happen in&amp;nbsp;''P. calura''&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;''A. stuartii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=A. J.|date=July 1987|title=Stress and mortality in the red-tailed phascogale, Phascogale calura (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae)|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|volume=67|issue=1|pages=85–100|issn=0016-6480|pmid=3623073|doi=10.1016/0016-6480(87)90208-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports stress-induced mortality as a characteristic of small&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurid''&amp;nbsp;semelparity.

===== Large Dasyuridae =====

[[File:Dasyurus hallucatus -Queensland-8.jpg|thumb|''Dasyurus hallucatus'']]
''[[Northern quoll|Dasyurus hallucatus]]'', or the northern quoll, is a large&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurid''&amp;nbsp;and exhibits increased male mortality after the mating season. Unlike smaller&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurids'', male die-off in&amp;nbsp;''D. hallucatus''&amp;nbsp;is not due to endocrine system changes and there was no&amp;nbsp;[[Spermatogenesis|spermatogenic failure]]&amp;nbsp;after the mating season ended.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If male&amp;nbsp;''D. hallucatus''&amp;nbsp;survive past their first mating season, they may be able to engage in a second mating season. While the individuals in a 2001 study mostly died from vehicles or predation, researchers found evidence of physiological degradation in males, similar to the physiological degradation in small&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurids.''&amp;nbsp;This includes fur loss, parasite infestations, and weight loss. As the mating period went on, males became increasingly&amp;nbsp;[[Anemia|anemic]], but the anemia was not due to&amp;nbsp;[[ulcer]]ation&amp;nbsp;or gastrointestinal bleeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lack of elevated cortisol levels during mating periods in&amp;nbsp;''D. hallucatus''&amp;nbsp;means that there is no current universal explanation for the mechanism behind increased male mortality in&amp;nbsp;''Dasyuridae.''&amp;nbsp;Post-reproductive [[senescence]]&amp;nbsp;has also been proposed as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn, A. "Living slow and dying young: senescence in marsupials."&amp;nbsp;''Marsupial Biology: Recent Research, New Perspectives. University of New South Wales Press, Sydney''&amp;nbsp;(1997): 163-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In opossums ====

===== Grey slender mouse opossum (''Marmosa incana'') =====
[[File:Flickr - ggallice - Mouse opossum.jpg|thumb|''Mouse opossum'']]
The [[Marmosa|mouse opossum]] exhibits a semelparous reproductive strategy in males and females. Males disappear from their&amp;nbsp;[[Endemism|endemic area]]&amp;nbsp;after the reproductive season (February–May). Males found months later (June–August) are of lighter body weight and the molar teeth are less worn down, suggesting these males belong to a different generation. There is a drop off in the female population, but during the months of July and August, evidence of a gap between generations like the male gap. There is also lower body weight and less molar wear observed in females found after August. This is further supported by the evidence that females that reproduce are not observed the following year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lucia, Maria. "Annual age structure and reproductive patterns in Marmosa incana (Lund, 1841)(Didelphidae, Marsupialia)." (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; This species has been compared to a similarly related species&amp;nbsp;''[[Robinson's mouse opossum|Marmosa robinsoni]]''&amp;nbsp;and like&amp;nbsp;''M. incana''&amp;nbsp;in order to answer what would happen if a female that has reproduced were to survive to the next mating season.&amp;nbsp;''M. robinsoni''&amp;nbsp;has a&amp;nbsp;[[Estrous cycle|monoestrus]]&amp;nbsp;reproductive cycle, like&amp;nbsp;''M. incana'', and females are no longer fertile after 17 months so it is unlikely that females that survive past the drop off in female populations would be able to reproduce a second time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Catita (Gracilinanus microtarsus) - Leonardo Merçon.jpg|thumb|''Gracilinanus microtarsus'']]
Other mouse opossums

''[[Brazilian gracile opossum|Gracilinanus microtarsus]]'', or the Brazilian gracile opossum, is considered to be partially semelparous because male mortality increases significantly after the mating season, but some males survive to mate again in the next reproductive cycle. The males also exhibit similar physiological degradation demonstrated in&amp;nbsp;''Antechinus''and other semelparous&amp;nbsp;[[marsupial]]s&amp;nbsp;such as fur loss and increase of infection from parasites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martins|first=Eduardo G.|last2=Bonato|first2=Vinícius|last3=da-Silva|first3=Cibele Q.|last4=Reis|first4=Dos|last5=F|first5=Sérgio|date=2006-10-17|title=Partial Semelparity in the Neotropical Didelphid Marsupial Gracilinanus microtarsus|url=https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/87/5/915/900694|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=87|issue=5|pages=915–920|doi=10.1644/05-mamm-a-403r1.1|issn=0022-2372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semelparity in fish ===

==== Pacific salmon ====
Highly elevated cortisol levels mediate the post-spawning death of semelparous ''[[Oncorhynchus]]'' Pacific salmon by causing tissue degeneration, suppressing the immune system, and impairing various homeostatic mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-629060-8.50017-5|title=SALMONIDS AND ANNUAL FISHES: DEATH AFTER SEX|last=Dickhoff|first=Walton W.|pages=253–266|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-629060-8.50017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After swimming for such a long distance, salmon expend all of their energy on reproduction. One of the key factors in salmon rapid [[senescence]] is that these fish do not feed during reproduction so body weight is extremely reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morbey|first=Yolanda E.|last2=Brassil|first2=Chad E.|last3=Hendry|first3=Andrew P.|title=Rapid Senescence in Pacific Salmon|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/full/10.1086/491720|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=166|issue=5|pages=556–568|doi=10.1086/491720|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to physiological degradation, pacific salmon become more lethargic as mating goes on, which makes some individuals more susceptible to predation because they have less energy to avoid predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gende|first=Scott M.|last2=Quinn|first2=Thomas P.|last3=Hilborn|first3=Ray|last4=Hendry|first4=Andrew P.|last5=Dickerson|first5=Bobette|date=2004-03-01|title=Brown bears selectively kill salmon with higher energy content but only in habitats that facilitate choice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12762.x/abstract|journal=Oikos|language=en|volume=104|issue=3|pages=518–528|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12762.x|issn=1600-0706}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also increases mortality rates of adults post-mating.

=== Semelparity in insects ===
[[File:Gypsy Moth (35955436354).jpg|thumb|Gypsy Moth]]
Traditionally,&amp;nbsp;semelparity was usually defined within the time frame of a year. Critics of this criterion note that this scale is inappropriate in discussing patterns of insect reproduction because many insects breed more than once within one annual period, but generation times of less than one year. Under the traditional definition, insects are considered semelparous as a consequence of time scale rather than the distribution of reproductive effort over their adult life span.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fritz|first=Robert S.|last2=Stamp|first2=Nancy E.|last3=Halverson|first3=Timothy G.|date=1982|title=Iteroparity and Semelparity in Insects|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=120|issue=2|pages=264–268|doi=10.1086/283987|jstor=2461222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to resolve this inconsistency, Fritz ''et. al'' define semelparous insects as "Insects that lay a single [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch of eggs]] in their lifetime and deposit them at one place are clearly semelparous or big bang reproducers. Their entire reproductive effort is committed at one time and they die shortly after [[Oviparity|oviposition]]".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Semelparous insects are found in [[Lepidoptera]], [[Mayfly|Ephemeroptera]], [[Earwig|Dermaptera]], [[Plecoptera]], [[Strepsiptera]], [[Caddisfly|Trichoptera]], and [[Homoptera]].

==== Examples in Lepidoptera ====
Females of certain families of Lepidoptera, like the [[Lymantria dispar|Gypsy Moth]] of ''[[Bagworm moth|Psychidae]],'' have reduced mobility or [[Aptery|apterous]] so the insects' dispersal is in the larval stage, as opposed to in the adult stage. In iteroparous insects, major dispersal occurs in the adult stage. All semelparous Lepidopterans share similar characteristics: Larva only feed in restricted periods of the year because of the nutritional state of their host plants (as a result, they are [[univoltine]]), initial food supply is predictably abundant, and larval host plants are abundant and adjacent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Death most commonly occurs by starvation. In the case of the gypsy moth, adults do not possess an active digestive system and cannot feed, but can drink moisture. Mating occurs fairly rapidly after adults emerge from their [[pupa]]l form and, without a way to digest food, the adult moths die after about a week.&lt;ref&gt;The Gypsy Moth: Research Toward Integrated Pest Management, United States Department of Agriculture, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary advantages to semelparity ==

=== Current evolutionary advantages hypothesis ===
[[File:Agile Antechinus (Antechinus agilis) showing offspring inside.jpg|thumb|''Antechinus agilis'' showing offspring inside pouch]]
The evolution for semelparity in both sexes has occurred many times in plants, invertebrates, and fish. It is rare in mammals because mammals have obligate maternal care due to&amp;nbsp;[[internal fertilization]]&amp;nbsp;and incubation of offspring and nursing young after birth, which requires high maternal survival rate after fertilization and offspring&amp;nbsp;[[weaning]]. Also, female mammals have relatively low reproductive rate compared to invertebrates or fish because they invest a lot of energy in maternal care. However, male reproductive rate is much less constrained in mammals because only females bear young. Males that die after one mating season can still produce a large number of offspring if he invests all of his energy in intense matings with many females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Diana O.|last2=Dickman|first2=Christopher R.|last3=Jones|first3=Menna E.|last4=Blomberg|first4=Simon P.|date=2013-10-29|title=Sperm competition drives the evolution of suicidal reproduction in mammals|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/44/17910|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=110|issue=44|pages=17910–17914|doi=10.1073/pnas.1310691110|issn=0027-8424|pmid=24101455|pmc=3816400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution in mammals ====
Scientists have hypothesized that natural selection has allowed semelparity to evolved in&amp;nbsp;''Dasyuridae''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''Didelphidae''&amp;nbsp;because of certain ecological constraints. Female mammals ancestral to this these groups may have shortened their mating period to coincide with peak prey abundance. Because this window is so small, the females of these species exhibit a reproduction pattern where the&amp;nbsp;[[Estrous cycle|estrous]]&amp;nbsp;of all females occurs simultaneously. Selection would then favor aggressive males due to increased competition between males for access to females. Since the mating period is so short, it is more beneficial for males to expend all their energy on mating, even more so if they are unlikely to survive to the next mating season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braithwaite|first=Richard W.|last2=Lee|first2=Anthony K.|date=1979|title=A Mammalian Example of Semelparity|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=113|issue=1|pages=151–155|doi=10.1086/283372|jstor=2459950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution in fish ====
[[File:Dead salmon in spawning season.jpg|thumb|Dead salmon after spawning]]
Reproduction is costly for [[Fish migration|anadromous]] [[Salmonidae|salmonids]] because their life history requires transition from saltwater to freshwater streams and long migrations, which can be physiologically taxing. The transition between cold oceanic water to warm freshwater and steep elevation changes in Northern Paciﬁc rivers could explain the evolution of semelparity because it would be extremely difficult to return to the ocean. A noticeable difference between semelparous fish and iteroparous salmonids is that egg size varies between the two types of reproductive strategies. Studies show that egg size is also affected by migration and body size. Egg number, however shows little variation between semelparous and iteroparous populations or between resident and anadromous populations for females of the same body size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=HUL Access/2.0|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/ele.12607/abstract|doi=10.1111/ele.12607}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current hypothesis behind this reason is that iteroparous species reduce the size of their eggs in order to improve the mother's chances survival, since she invests less energy in gamete formation. Semelparous species do not expect to live past one mating season, so females invest a lot more energy in gamete formation resulting in large eggs. Anadromous salmonids may also have evolved semelparity to boost the nutrition density of the [[Spawn (biology)|spawning grounds]]. The most productive Pacific salmon spawning grounds contain the most carcasses of spawned adults. The dead bodies of the adult salmon decompose and provide nitrogen and phosphorus for [[algae]] to grow in the nutrient-poor water. [[Zooplankton]] then feed on the algae, and newly-hatched salmon feed on the zooplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-0677-4_7|title=Freshwaters of Alaska|last=Kline|first=Thomas C.|last2=Goering|first2=John J.|last3=Piorkowski|first3=Robert J.|date=1997|publisher=Springer, New York, NY|isbn=9781461268666|series=Ecological Studies|pages=179–204|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0677-4_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution in insects ====
[[File:Earwig guarding eggs.jpg|thumb|Earwig guarding eggs]]
An interesting trait has evolved in semelparous insects, especially in those that have evolved from [[Parasitism|parasitic]] ancestors, like in all subsocial and [[Eusocial insect|eusocial]] [[Aculeata|aculeate]] [[Hymenoptera]]. This is because larvae are morphologically specialized for development within a host's innards and thus are entirely helpless outside of that environment. Females would need to invest a lot of energy in protecting their eggs and hatched offspring. They do this through such behaviors as egg guarding. Mothers that actively defend offspring, for example, risk injury or death by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TALLAMY|first=DOUGLAS W.|last2=BROWN|first2=WILLIAM P.|title=Semelparity and the evolution of maternal care in insects|url=https://doi.org/10.1006/anbe.1998.1008|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=57|issue=3|pages=727–730|doi=10.1006/anbe.1998.1008|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not beneficial in an iteroparous species because the female risks dying and not reaching her full reproductive potential by not being able to reproduce in all reproductive periods in her lifetime. Since semelparous insects only live for one reproductive cycle, they can afford to expend energy on maternal care because those offspring are her only offspring. An iteroparous insect does not need to expend energy on the eggs of one mating period because it is likely that she will mate again. There is ongoing research in maternal care in semelparous insects from lineages not descended from parasites to further understand this relationship between semelparity and maternal care.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">In [[comparative genomics]], a '''sequence graph''', also called an '''alignment graph''', '''breakpoint graph''', or '''adjacency graph''', is a [[bidirected graph]] in which the vertices represent segments of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and the edges represent adjacency between segments in a genome. &lt;ref&gt;Alekseyev, Max A., and Pavel A. Pevzner. “Breakpoint Graphs and Ancestral Genome Reconstructions.” Genome Research 19.5 (2009): 943–957. PMC. Web. 20 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The segments are labeled by the DNA string they represent, and each edge connects the tail end of one segment with the head end of another segment. Each adjacency edge is labelled by a (possibly empty) string of DNA. Traversing a connected component of segments and adjacency edges (called a ''thread'') yields a sequence, which typically represents a genome or a section of a genome. The segments can be thought of as synteny blocks, with the edges dictating how to arrange these blocks in a particular genome, and the labelling of the adjacency edges representing bases that are not contained in synteny blocks. 

==Applications==
===Multiple sequence alignment===
Sequence graphs can be used to represent [[multiple sequence alignment|multiple sequence alignments]] with the addition of a new kind of edge representing [[homology (biology)|homology]] between segments. &lt;ref&gt;Paten B, Zerbino DR, Hickey G, Haussler D. A unifying model of genome evolution under parsimony. BMC Bioinformatics. 2014;15:206. doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-206. &lt;/ref&gt; For a set of genomes, one can create an acyclic breakpoint graph with a thread for each genome. For two segments &lt;math&gt;(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(c,d)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; represent the endpoints of the two segments, homology edges can be created from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; or from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; - representing the two possible orientations of the homology. The advantage of representing a multiple sequence alignment this way is that it is possible to include inversions and other structural rearrangements that wouldn't be allowable in a matrix representation.
===Representing variation===
If there are multiple possible paths when traversing a thread in a sequence graph, multiple sequences can be represented by the same thread. This means it is possible to create a sequence graph that represents a population of individuals with slightly different genomes - with each genome corresponding to one path through the graph. These graphs have been proposed as a replacement for the reference human genome. &lt;ref&gt;Paten, B., Novak, A., Haussler, D. 2014, arXiv:1404.5010&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Spiritual but not religious'''" ('''SBNR''') also known as "'''Spiritual but not affiliated'''" ('''SBNA''') is a popular phrase and initialism used to self-identify a [[life stance]] of [[spirituality]] that takes issue with [[organized religion]] as the sole or most valuable means of furthering spiritual growth. Historically, the words ''religious'' and ''spiritual'' have been used synonymously to describe all the various aspects of the concept of religion,{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} but in contemporary usage spirituality has often been associated with the interior life of the individual,&lt;ref&gt;Carette and King, Selling Spirituality, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} placing an emphasis upon the well-being of the "mind-body-spirit",&lt;ref name="Heelas2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Heelas|title=Spiritualities of Life: New Age Romanticism and Consumptive Capitalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-J0e2L-w_oC|date=21 January 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-0111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63}} while ''religion'' refers to organizational or communal dimensions.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}}

==Origins and demography==
Historically, the words ''religious'' and ''spiritual'' have been used synonymously to describe all the various aspects of the concept of religion.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} However, religion is a highly contested term with scholars such as [[Russell T. McCutcheon|Russell McCutcheon]] arguing that the term "religion" is used as a way to name a "seemingly distinct domain of diverse items of human activity and production".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Will Your Cognitive Anchor Hold in the Storms of Culture?|url = http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org/content/78/4/1182|journal = Journal of the American Academy of Religion|date = 2010-12-01|issn = 0002-7189|pages = 1182–1193|volume = 78|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/jaarel/lfq085|first = Russell T.|last = McCutcheon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[Religious studies|Religious Studies]] cannot even agree on one definition for religion and since spirituality overlaps with it in many ways it is difficult to reach a consensus for a definition for spirituality as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Critical Theory and the Importance of Religious Studies|url = http://bulletin.equiof SBNRnoxpub.com/2012/12/critical-theory-and-the-importance-of-religious-studies/|website = Bulletin for the Study of Religion|accessdate = 2015-12-06|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Linda Mercandante, the concept of religion is a [[social construct]], since in other eras, religion, culture, and even national identity were often inseparable. And as for spirituality, this is an old concept with a new usage.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} Previous to today’s era, what people today call spirituality was often called piety.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} Mercadante sees religion as a complex adaptive network of myths, symbols, rituals and concepts that simultaneously figure patterns of feeling, thinking, and acting and disrupt stable structures of meaning and purpose.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} When understood in that way, religion not only involves ideas and practices that are manifestly religious but also includes a broad range of cultural phenomena not ordinarily associated with religion.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} Many people use spirituality to refer to their interior life of faith and religion to mean the necessary communal and/or organizational part.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} Mercadante sees both spirituality and religion as consisting of four basic components: beliefs, desire, rituals, and behavioural expectations, but across the field of Religious Studies the definitions vary.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}}}} 

Although the specific expression was used in one scholarly, anthropological paper back in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lU9SAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22spiritual+but+not+religious%22&amp;dq=%22spiritual+but+not+religious%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwio54bYsK_MAhUQ22MKHdl9C1UQ6AEILjAE|title=Publications in Anthropology, 1960.}}&lt;/ref&gt; SBNR as a movement in America was first named and delineated by author [[Sven Erlandson]] in his 2000 book "Spiritual but not Religious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Erlandson|first1 = Sven|title = Spiritual but Not Religious: A Call to Religious Revolution in America.|date = 2000|publisher = iUniverse|location = Bloomington|isbn = 059501108X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tst.edu/about/spiritual-not-religious&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://reflectorgsu.com/spiritual-but-not-religious-the-movement/&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon possibly started to emerge as a result of a new Romantic movement that began in the 1960s, whereas the relationship between the two has been remotely linked to [[William James]]' definition of religious experience, which he defines as the "feelings, acts and experiences of individual
their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenneson|first1=Philip D.|title=What’s in a Name? A Brief Introduction to the "Spiritual But Not Religious"|journal=Liturgy|date=July 2015|volume=30|issue=3|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romantic movements tend to lean away from traditional religion and resemble spiritual movements in their endorsement of mystical, unorthodox, and exotic ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Owen|title=Spiritual but Not Religious: The Influence of the Current Romantic Movement|journal=Anglican Theological Review|date=January 2006|volume=88|issue=3|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen Thomas also states that the ambiguity and lack of structure present in Romantic movements are also present within spiritual movements.

According to a study conducted by Pew Research Center in 2012, the number of Americans who do not identify with any religion has increased from 15% in 2007 to 20% in 2012, and this number continues to grow. One fifth of the US public and a third of adults under the age of 30 are reportedly unaffiliated with any religion but identify as being spiritual in some way. Of these religiously unaffiliated Americans, 37% classify themselves as spiritual but not religious, while 68% say they do believe in God, and 58% feel a deep connection to the Earth.&lt;ref name="Nones on the Rise"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funk|first1=Cary|last2=Smith|first2=Greg|title="Nones" on the Rise: One-in-Five Adults Have No Religious Affiliation|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/10/NonesOnTheRise-full.pdf|website=pewforum.org|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased popular and scholarly attention to "spirituality" has been related by scholars like [[Kenneth Pargament|Pargament]] to sociocultural trends towards deinstitutionalization, individualization, and [[globalization]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Marler|first1 = Penny Long|last2 = Hadaway|first2 = C. Kirk|title = "Being Religious" or "Being Spiritual" in America: A Zero Sum Proposition?|journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date = June 2002|volume = 41|issue = 2|doi=10.1111/1468-5906.00117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generational replacement has been understood as a significant factor of the growth of religiously unaffiliated individuals. Significant differences were found between the percentage of those considered younger [[Millennials]] (born 1990{{ndash}}1994) as compared with [[Generation X]]ers (born 1965{{ndash}}1980), with 34% and 21% reporting to be religiously unaffiliated, respectively.&lt;ref name="Nones on the Rise"/&gt;

Demographically, research has found that the religiously unaffiliated population is younger, predominately male, and 35% are between the ages of 18 and 29. Conversely, only 8% of religiously unaffiliated individuals are 65 and older. Among those unaffiliated with organized religion as a whole, 56% are men and 44% are women.&lt;ref name="Nones on the Rise"/&gt;

Another possible explanation for the emergence of SBNR is linguistic. Owen Thomas highlights the fact that  spirituality movements tend to be localized to English and North American cultures. The meaning of the term "spirit" is more narrow in English than that of other languages, referring to all of the uniquely human capacities and cultural functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Owen|title=Spiritual but Not Religious: The Influence of the Current Romantic Movement|journal=Anglican Theological Review|date=January 2006|volume=88|issue=3|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, according to Siobhan Chandler, to appreciate the "god within" is not a twentieth century notion with its roots in 1960s counter culture or 1980s New Age, but spirituality is a concept that has pervaded all of history.{{sfn|Chandler|2013}}

== Characteristics of SBNR==

===Anti-institutional and personal===
According to Abby Day, some of those who are critical of religion see it as rigid and pushy, leading them to use terms such as [[Atheism|atheist]], [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] to describe themselves.&lt;ref name="Ashgate"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last = Day|editor1-first = Abby|title = Social identities between the sacred and the secular|date = 2013|publisher = Ashgate|location = Burlington|isbn = 978-1-4094-5677-3|edition = New edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many people, SBNR is not just about rejecting religion outright, but not wanting to be restricted by it.&lt;ref name="Ashgate"/&gt; 

According to Linda Mercadante, SBNRs take a decidedly anti-dogmatic stance against religious belief in general. They claim not only that belief is non-essential, but that it is potentially harmful or at least a hindrance to spirituality.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}}

According to Philip D. Kenneson, many of those studied who identify as SBNR feel a tension between their personal spirituality and membership in a conventional religious organization. Most of them value curiosity, intellectual freedom, and an experimental approach to religion. Many go as far to view organized religion as the major enemy of authentic spirituality, claiming that spirituality is private reflection and private experience—not public ritual.{{sfn|Kenneson|2015|p=5}} To be "religious" conveys an institutional connotation, usually associated with Abrahamic traditions: to attend worship services, to say Mass, to light Hanukkah candles. To be "spiritual," in contrast, connotes personal practice and personal empowerment having to do with the deepest motivations of life.{{sfn|Kenneson|2015|p=5}} As a result, in cultures that are deeply suspicious of institutional structures and that place a high value on individual freedom and autonomy, spirituality has come to have largely positive connotations, while religion has been viewed more negatively.{{sfn|Kenneson|2015|p=5}} 

According to Robert Fuller, the SBNR phenomenon can be characterized as a mix of intellectual progressivism and mystical hunger, impatient with the [[piety]] of established churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Fuller|first1 = Robert C.|title = Spiritual, but not religious: Understanding unchurched America.|date = 2001|publisher = Oxford University Press|location = New York|isbn = 0195146808|pages = 12|edition = [Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Wuthnow, spirituality is about much more than going to church and agreeing or disagreeing with church doctrines. Spirituality is the shorthand term used in Western society to talk about a person's relationship with God.{{sfn|Wuthnow|2007}} For many people, how they think about religion and spirituality is certainly guided by what they see and do in their congregations.{{sfn|Wuthnow|2007}} At a deeper level, it involves a person's self-identity—feeling loved by God, and these feelings can wax and wane.{{sfn|Wuthnow|2007}}

===Categorization of SBNRs===
Linda A. Mercadante categorizes SBNRs into five distinct categories:{{sfn|Mercadante|2014|p=35-67}} 
# "[[Dissenter]]s" are the people who, for the most part, make a conscious effort to veer away from institutional religion. "Protesting dissenters" refers to those SBNRs who have been 'turned off' religious affiliation because of adverse personal experiences with it. "Drifted Dissenters" refers to those SBNRs who, for a multitude of reasons, fell out of touch with organized religion and chose never to go back. "Conscientious objector dissenters" refers to those SBNRs who are overtly skeptical of religious institutions and are of the view that religion is neither a useful nor necessary part of an individual's spirituality. 
# "Casuals" are the people who see religious and/or spiritual practices as primarily functional. Spirituality is not an organizing principle in their lives. Rather they believe it should be used on an as-needed basis for bettering their health, relieving stress, and for emotional support. The spirituality of "Casuals" is thus best understood as a "therapeutic" spirituality that centers on the individual's personal wellbeing.
# "Explorers" are the people who seem to have what Mercandante refers to as a "spiritual wanderlust". These SBNRs find their constant search for novel spiritual practices to be a byproduct of their "unsatisfied curiosity", their desire for journey and change, as well as feelings of disappointment. Explorers are best understood as "spiritual tourists" who take comfort in the destination-less journey of their spirituality and have no intentions of ultimately committing to a spiritual home.
# "Seekers" are those people who are looking for a spiritual home but contemplate recovering earlier religious identities. These SBNRs embrace the "spiritual but not religious" label and are eager to find a completely new religious identity or alternative spiritual group that they can ultimately commit to.
# "Immigrants" are those people who have found themselves in a novel spiritual realm and are trying to adjust themselves to this newfound identity and its community. "Immigrants" can be best understood as those SBNRs who are "trying on" a radically new spiritual environment but have yet to feel completely settled there. It is important to note that for these SBNRs, although they are hoping to become fully integrated in their newfound spiritual identities, the process of acclimation is difficult and often disconcerting.

===Practices===
{{See also|Spirituality|New Age}}

SBNR is related to [[feminist]] spiritual and religious thought and ecological spiritualities,{{sfn|Fuller|2001|p=76-100}} and also to [[Neo-Pagan|Neo-Paganism]], [[Wicca]], [[Shaman]]ic, [[Druid]]ic, [[New Age Gaian|Gaia]]n and [[ceremonial magic]] practices.{{sfn|Fuller|2001|p=76-100}} Some New Age spiritual practices include [[astrology]], [[Ouija]] boards, [[Tarot]] cards, the ''[[I Ching]],'' and [[science fiction]].{{sfn|Fuller|2001|p=76-100}} A common practice of SBNRs is [[meditation]], such as [[mindfulness]] and [[Transcendental Meditation]].{{sfn|Fuller|2001|p=76-100}}

==Criticism==
Some representatives of organized religion have criticized the practice of spirituality without religiosity. Lillian Daniel, a liberal Protestant minister, has characterized the SBNR worldview as a product of secular American consumer culture, far removed from community and "right smack in the bland majority of people who find ancient religions dull but find themselves uniquely fascinating".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Christians need the church: An interview with Lillian Daniel|url = http://jonathanmerritt.religionnews.com/2013/08/13/answering-the-spiritual-but-religious-an-interview-with-lillian-daniel/|website = On Faith &amp; Culture|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Martin (Jesuit)|James Martin]], a Jesuit priest, has called the SBNR lifestyle "plain old laziness",&lt;ref name=CNN2010-dangers&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/personal/06/03/spiritual.but.not.religious/index.html | work=[[CNN.com]] | title=Are there dangers in being 'spiritual but not religious'? | date=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "spirituality without religion can become a self-centered complacency divorced from the wisdom of a community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bustedhalo.com/features/spiritual-but-not-religious-not-so-fast/2| title= Spiritual but not religious - Not so fast!: Making the case for moving beyond your own personal God| first= James| last= Martin| authorlink= James Martin (Jesuit)| date= 2010-03-11| work= [[Busted Halo]]: an online magazine for spiritual seekers| accessdate= 2010-09-19| quote= "Spirituality without religion can become a self-centered complacency divorced from the wisdom of a community."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics contend that within the "Spiritual but not Religious" worldview, self-knowledge and self-growth have been problematically equated with knowledge of God, directing a person's focus inward. As a result, the political, economic, and social forces that shape the world are neglected and left untended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spiritual, but Not Religious: Understanding Unchurched America|last = Fuller|first = Robert|publisher = Oxford|year = 2001|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some scholars have noted the relative spiritual superficiality of particular SBNR practices. Classical mysticism within the world's major religions requires sustained dedication, often in the form of prolonged asceticism, extended devotion to prayer, and the cultivation of humility. In contrast, SBNRs in the Western world are encouraged to dabble in spiritual practices in a way that is often casual and lacking in rigor or any reorganization of priorities. Sociologist Robert Wuthnow suggests that these forms of mysticism are "shallow and inauthentic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spiritual, but Not Religious: Understanding Unchurched America|last = Fuller|first = Robert|publisher = Oxford|year = 2001|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics take issue with the intellectual legitimacy of SBNR scholarship. When contrasted with professional or academic theology, spiritual philosophies can appear unpolished, disjointed, or inconsistently sourced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spiritual, but Not Religious: Understanding Unchurched America|last = Fuller|first = Robert|publisher = Oxford|year = 2001|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong and Vinsky challenge SBNR discourse that posits religion as "institutional and structured" in contrast to spirituality as "inclusive and universal" (1346).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Speaking from the Margins: A Critical Reflection on the ‘Spiritual-but-not-Religious’ Discourse in Social Work|last = Wong|first = Yuk-Lin Renita|date = 2009|journal = British Journal of Social Work|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Vinsky|first2 = Jana&lt;!--|pages = 1343–1359--&gt;|pages = 1352–1354}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that this understanding makes invisible the historical construction of "spirituality", which currently relies on a rejection of EuroChristianity for its own self-definition. According to them, Western discourses of "spirituality" appropriate indigenous spiritual traditions and "ethnic" traditions of the East, yet racialized ethnic groups are more likely to be labeled "religious" than "spiritual" by white SBNR practitioners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wong and Vinsky assert that through these processes, colonial [[othering]] is enacted through SBNR discourse.

'''''The Wandering Jew''''' is a 1933 British fantasy drama film produced by the [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]]-[[Twickenham Film Studios]]. It is the story of a Jew (played by [[Conrad Veidt]]) who is forced to wander the Earth for centuries because he rebuffed [[Jesus]] while he was carrying his cross.

Other cast members included a very young [[Peggy Ashcroft]], [[Francis L. Sullivan]], and [[Felix Aylmer]].

==Plot==
The plot follows the [[The Wandering Jew|eponymous character's]] epic journey. He is finally burnt at the stake by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. As he burns, he is forgiven by God and finally allowed to die. The story bears a resemblance to the legend of the [[Flying Dutchman]].

==Portrayal of Jews==
Unlike the [[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|antisemitic propaganda film produced by the Nazis in 1940]], this film portrayed Jews in a favorable light as the victims of unjustified persecution throughout history, in the [[Spanish Inquisition]], for example. The Nazi propaganda film, by contrast, was  intended as violently anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Saul|last= Friedlander|year=2008|title='The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews 1939-1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3928">'''Widow inheritance''' (also known as '''bride inheritance''') is a cultural and social practice whereby a [[widow]] is required to [[Marriage|marry]] a male relative of her late husband, often his brother. Examples of widow inheritance can be found in ancient and [[biblical]] times in the form of [[levirate marriage]].

The practice was meant as a means for the widow to have someone to support her and her children financially, and to keep her late husband's wealth within the family bloodline. At the time it was initiated, women were responsible for the house chores and men were the providers, therefore if the woman lost her husband, she would have no one to provide for the remaining family. Because her in-laws would not want someone outside of the family's blood line to inherit her late husband's estate, she was required to marry within the family.

This can have various forms and functions in different cultures, serving in relative proportions as a [[social protection]] for, and control over, the widow and her children. She may have the ''right'' to require her late husband's [[extended family]] to provide her with a new man, or conversely she might have the ''obligation'' to accept the man put forward by the family, with no real prospect of turning him down, if her birth family will not accept her back into their home.

The custom is sometimes justified on the basis that it ensures that the wealth does not leave the [[patrilineal]] family. It is also sometimes justified as a protection for the widow and her children.

== Widow inheritance by region ==
A form of widow inheritance existed in ancient [[Judaism]], where it is known as [[levirate marriage]] (see ''[[yibbum]]'').

=== Africa ===
It is common in certain African groups, for example the [[Dinka]] or Jieng of [[South Sudan]], and [[Luo (family of ethnic groups)|Luo]] in [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]] around [[Lake Victoria]]. Households headed by widows are often one of the poorest groups. Under customary law, it is assumed widows and their children will be taken care of by the deceased's kin. When there is a [[will and testament]], often all property is left to the children with the stipulation that the wife be taken care of. With no will, a widow is allowed 25% of the estate and the children inherit the remaining 75%.

In 1998, a study by FAO/IFAD in [[Ghana]] found that women's access to land was primarily through their husbands. When a husband dies, and the wife has no children, or only daughters, women are likely to lose all rights to the land. Often, the deceased's family do not take care of the widow and her children, and widow inheritance was identified as a major obstacle to household food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Uganda, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire - The situation of widows|url = http://www.ifad.org/gender/learning/challenges/widows/55.htm|website = www.ifad.org|accessdate = 2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Asia ===
Among [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] communities, the code known as [[Pashtunwali]] often involves widows to be remarried, even against their will, to her dead husband's brother or cousin. The Taliban campaigned against the practice as being against Shariah Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/special-report/2006/12/19/honour-among-them|title=Honour among them|publisher=Economist Magazine|accessdate=11 November 2018|date=19 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datamationfoundation.org/women3.htm Datamation Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;
