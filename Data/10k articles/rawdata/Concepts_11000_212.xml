      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10260">In the [[psychoanalysis]] of [[Sigmund Freud]], '''afterwardsness''' is a "mode of belated understanding or retroactive attribution of sexual or traumatic meaning to earlier events... [from the German word] ''Nachträglichkeit'', translated as deferred action, retroaction, [[:fr:après-coup|après-coup]], afterwardsness".&lt;ref&gt;Teresa de Lauretis, ''Freud's Drive: Psychoanalysis, Literature and Film'' (Basingstoke 2008), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; As summarized by another scholar, 'In one sense, Freud's theory of deferred action can be simply stated: memory is reprinted, so to speak, in accordance with later experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development of the term==

===Freud===
The psychoanalytical concept of "afterwardsness" ({{lang-de|Nachträglichkeit}}) appeared initially in [[Freud]]'s writings in the 1890s in the commonsense form of the German adjective-adverb "afterwards" or "deferred" (''nachträglich''): as Freud wrote in the unfinished and unpublished "A Project for a Scientific Psychology" of 1895, 'a memory is repressed which has only become a trauma ''after the event'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jean Laplanche, ''Life and Death in Psychoanalysis'' (London 1976), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; However the 'theory of deferred action had already been [publicly] put forward by Freud in the ''Studies on Hysteria'' (1895)',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991), p. 278n&lt;/ref&gt; and in a paper of 1896 'he elaborates on the idea of ''deferred action'': the pathogenic effect of a traumatic event occurring in childhood...[manifesting] retrospectively when the child reaches a subsequent phase of sexual development'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London 2006), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The same idea would feature prominently a couple of decades later in his study of the "Wolf Man": 'The effects of the scene were deferred, but...had the same effect as though it were a recent experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991), pp. 276–7&lt;/ref&gt; 'Thus although he never offered a definition, much less a general theory, of the notion of deferred action, it was indisputably looked on by Freud as part of his conceptual equipment'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Laplanche and J.-B. Pontalis, in Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacan===
It was [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] who brought the term back from obscurity after Freud's death—his translation in the French language as the "[[:fr:après-coup|après-coup]]" fits into the context of his "return to Freud" ("rapport de Rome", 1953)—and certainly French [[psychoanalysis]] has since taken the lead in its explication. Lacan himself claimed in his Seminar that "the real implication of the ''nachträglich'', for example, has been ignored, though it was there all the time and had only to be picked up,"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; while writing in Ecrits of "'deferred action' (''Nachtrag''), to rescue another of these terms from the facility into which they have since fallen...they were unheard of at that time."&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1996), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean Laplanche===
After Lacan's ''après-coup'',  [[Jean Laplanche]]’s contribution to the concept of the afterwardsness signifies something very  different:&lt;ref&gt;See particularly: [[Jean Laplanche]], "Sa reviviscence en France", "Chez Lacan avec [[Heidegger]]" in: Jean Laplanche, ''Problématiques VI. L'après-coup'', Paris, PUF, 2006, p. 16-22.&lt;/ref&gt; with Jean Laplanche and in the relation to Freud (theory of the seduction, ''neurotica''), Lacan's "Other" loses its capital letter of the "[[The Symbolic|Symbolic]]", that links [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] to French [[structuralism]] ([[Saussure]]'s [[linguistics]], [[Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[ethnology]]), and that links also Lacan ''afterwards'' in the history of the ideas (from the 1960s on)—by "inversion in the opposite direction" (a "destiny of the [[drive theory|drive]]" in psychoanalytic theory)—to the [[:fr:French theory|French theory]] at the place of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;Roseline Bonnellier, "De ''[[Hölderlin]] et la question du père'' à la ''[[:fr:théorie de la séduction généralisée|théorie de la séduction généralisée]]'' de [[:fr:Jean Laplanche|Jean Laplanche]]: Avancée paradoxale de la traduction d’''Œdipe'' en psychanalyse ", thèse du Doctorat de psychologie, Université Paris-XIII, 2007, 1050 pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roseline Bonnellier, ''Sous le soleil de [[Hölderlin]]: Oedipe en question - Au premier temps du complexe était la fille'', Paris, L'Harmattan, Collection "Études psychanalytiques" (dirigée par Alain Brun et Joël Bernat), février 2010, 360 pages, {{ISBN|978-2-296-10411-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Afterwardsness"  becomes the key concept in Laplanche’s "[[theory of the general seduction]]" (''[[:fr:théorie de la séduction généralisée|théorie de la séduction généralisée]]'') and  of the corresponding importance of 'the act of ''psychic translation''... of [enigmatic] deposits by the other'&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Elliott, ''Social Theory since Freud'' (London 20040 p. 13 and p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;—an approach which develops further Freud's letter 52/112 (to [[Wilhelm Fliess]]). In his "Notes on Afterwardsness" (1992), based on a conversation of [[Jean Laplanche]] with [[Martin Stanton]],&lt;ref&gt;''Jean Laplanche: Seduction, Translation, Drives'', A dossier compiled by John Fletcher and Martin Stanton, Translations by Martin Stanton, Psychoanalytic Forum, Institute of Contemporary Arts London, 1992, p. 217-223.  {{ISBN|0-905263-68-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an excellent definition of ''afterwardsness'' in Laplanche's sense, including the category  of the ''enigmatic message'', that highlights Laplanche's contribution to [[Freud]]'s concept:
{{cquote | Freud's concept of afterwardsness contains both great richness and great ambiguity between retrogressive and progressive directions. I want to account for this problem of the directional to and fro by arguing that, right at the start, there is something that goes in the direction from the past to the future, and in the direction from the adult to the baby, which I call the implantation of the enigmatic message. This message is then retranslated following a temporal direction which is sometimes progressive and sometimes retrogressive (according to my general model of translation).&lt;ref&gt;Jean Laplanche in ''Jean Laplanche: Seduction, Translation, Drives'', A dossier compiled by John Fletcher and Martin Stanton, Translations by Martin Stanton, Psychoanalytic Forum, Institute of Contemporary Arts London, 1992, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Deferred obedience==
Closely related for Freud to deferred action was [[deferred obedience]]: again, 'a ''deferred'' effect...a "deferred obedience" under the influence of [[psychological repression|repression]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Standard Edition X'' (London 1955), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for instance Freud explored the different phases of a man's infantile attitude to his father: 'As long as his father was alive it showed itself in unmitigated rebelliousness and open discord, but immediately after his death it took the form of a [[neurosis]] based on abject submission and deferred obedience to him'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Totem and Taboo'' he generalised the principle and 'depicted the social contract also as based on posthumous obedience to the father's authority'&lt;ref&gt;Jose Bruner, ''Freud and the Politics of Psychoanalysis'' (2001), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;—offset at times by its converse, occasional [[Carnival]]-like licence such as 'the memorial festival of the totem meal, in which the ''restrictions'' of deferred obedience no longer held'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julia Kristeva]]/Jeanine Herman, ''The Sense and Non-Sense of Revolt'' (Columbia 2001), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Akhdam''', '''Akhdam''' or '''Achdam''' ("the servants," singular '''Khadem''', meaning "servant" in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; also called ''Al-Muhamasheen'', "the marginalized ones") is a minority social group in [[Yemen]]. Although the Akhdams are Arabic-speaking Muslims just like any other Yemeni,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = YEMEN: Akhdam people suffer history of discrimination|url = http://www.irinnews.org/report/25634/yemen-akhdam-people-suffer-history-of-discrimination|website = IRINnews|accessdate = 2015-11-28|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are considered to be at the very bottom of the supposedly abolished [[caste]] ladder, are [[social segregation|socially segregated]], and are mostly confined to menial jobs in the country's major cities.&lt;ref name=nyt2008&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/world/middleeast/27yemen.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss  Robert F. Worth, "Languishing at the Bottom of Yemen’s Ladder", ''New York Times,'' (February 27 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to official estimates, the Akhdam numbered between 500,000 and 3,500,000 individuals.&lt;ref name="Yfbo"/&gt;

==Origins ==
[[File:The caves of Al-Akhdam in Sanaa in 1942.jpg|thumb|The caves of Al-Akhdam in Sanaa in 1942]]
[[File:Akhdam man Taizz.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Akhdam man or Khadem in [[Ta'izz]]]]
The exact origins of Al-Akhdam are uncertain. One popular belief holds that they are descendants of [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] [[Sudan]]ese people who accompanied the [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinian]] army during the latter's occupation of Yemen in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period. Once the Abyssinian troops were finally expelled at the start of the Muslim era, some of the Sudanese migrants are said to have remained behind, giving birth to the Akhdam people. This belief, however, was denied and described as a myth by Hamud al-Awdi, a professor of sociology at Sana University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Zooming into the Past|url = http://www.biyokulule.com/Yemen_akhdam.htm|website = www.biyokulule.com|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Societal Discrimination in Yemen ==
Anthropologists such as Vombruck postulate that [[History of Yemen|Yemen's history]] and social hierarchy that developed under various regimes, including the [[Imams of Yemen#History|Zaydi Imamate]], had created a hereditary caste-like society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Being worthy of protection.

=== Social Conditions ===
The Al-Akhdam community suffers from extreme discrimination, persecution, and social exclusion from the mainstream Yemeni society.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Yemen - International Dalit Solidarity Network|url = http://idsn.org/countries/yemen/|website = International Dalit Solidarity Network|accessdate = 2015-11-28|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contempt for the Akhdam people is expressed by a traditional Yemeni proverb: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Clean your plate if it is touched by a dog, but break it if it's touched by a Khadem.″&lt;/blockquote&gt;Though their social conditions have improved somewhat in modern times, Al-Akhdam are still stereotyped by mainstream Yemeni society; they have been called lowly, dirty and immoral.&lt;ref name="abadjian"&gt;{{cite news|title=In Yemen, lowest of the low|author =Marguerite Abadjian|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|date=April 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermarriages between the conventional Yemeni society with the Akhdam community are taboo and virtually prohibited, as the Al-Akhdam are deemed as [[Untouchability|untouchables]].&lt;ref name="Lehmann"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lehmann|first=Hermann|year=1954|title=Distribution of the sickle cell trait|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2973326/pdf/eugenrev00050-0031.pdf|journal=Eugenics Review|volume=46|issue=2|pages=113–116|pmc=2973326|pmid=21260667|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Men who do marry into the community risk banishment by their families.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Economic Status ===
In the face of extreme societal discrimination, the Al-Akhdam people are forced to work menial and dirty jobs such as sweeping, shoe-making and the cleaning of latrines, vocations for which they are still known to this day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those who are unemployed, most of whom are women,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; usually resort to begging.&lt;ref name="nyt2008" /&gt;

Even the Akhdam people who are employed are not spared from discrimination. Akhdam street sweepers are rarely granted contracts even after decades of work, despite the fact that all Yemeni civil servants are supposed to be granted contracts after six months.&lt;ref name="nyt2008" /&gt; They receive no benefits, and almost no time off.&lt;ref name="nyt2008" /&gt;

The Akhdam reside in slum districts that are generally isolated from the rest of Yemeni society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is hardly possible for the Akhdam people to afford shelter with even the most basic amenities such as electricity, running water and sewage system.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Untouchables of Yemen|url = http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/14260|website = Al Akhbar English|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, Akhdam generally live in small huts haphazardly built of wood and cloth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Health Conditions ===
Due to [[poverty]] and the unsanitary living conditions, the Akhdam people are vulnerable to preventable diseases. The death rates from preventable diseases are worse than the nationwide average in Yemen.&lt;ref name="nyt2008" /&gt; Many Al-Akhdam children suffer from diseases such as dyspnoea, malaria and polio, and the death rate is high.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reported infant mortality rate is also described as "appalling".&lt;ref name="nyt2008" /&gt; Out of the deaths reported in an Akhdam shantytown over a year, about a half were children under the age of 5, a quarter of whom were in the first month of life.&lt;ref name="nyt2008" /&gt;

Studies by Al-Serouri et al. further report a poorer understanding of HIV risks amongst the Al-Akhdam community. Accordingly, group members also have higher reported rates and risks of contracting HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = AIDS awareness and attitudes among Yemeni young people living in high-risk areas|authors= Al-Serouri A. W., Anaam M., Al-Iryani B., Al Deram A. &amp; Ramaroson, S. |date = 2010|journal = Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=242–250|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary Reforms ===
Many [[NGO]]s and charitable organizations from other countries such as [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE International]] are reportedly working toward improving the living circumstances of the Akhdam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080107135359/http://www.yementimes.com/99/iss01/l%26d.htm ''Yemen Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; Such initiatives include the building of a chicken farm, sanitation projects, the provision of electricity and classes aimed at eradicating illiteracy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The extent of these efforts, however, is disputed, most notably by Huda Sief.&lt;ref name="hudaseif"&gt;Huda Seif (2005), ''The Accursed Minority: The Ethno-Cultural Persecution of Al-Akhdam in the Republic of Yemen'', Muslim World Journal of Human Rights, Vol. 2, Issue 1, Art. 9, (pages 10, 29)&lt;/ref&gt; Government corruption also means that monetary aid intended for the Akhdam is often misused or stolen.&lt;ref name="nyt2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Akhdam: A look into lives of Yemen’s untouchables - Khaleej Times|url = http://www.khaleejtimes.com/article/20140122/ARTICLE/301229903/1016|website = www.khaleejtimes.com|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government officials, while admitting an historical disdain for the Akhdam among conventional Yemeni society, insist that there is no official discrimination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Yemeni government has occasionally built shelters for the Akhdam,&lt;ref name="nyt2008" /&gt; although it is reported that 30% of Akhdam who received such state housing sold it, choosing instead to return to their original neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite the supposed absence of official discrimination, many Akhdam claim that officials often block their attempts to seek state services at schools and hospitals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A significant step forward was achieved with the formation of a political party to represent them and possibly alleviate their conditions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Yemeni revolt in 2011 had also roused many Akhdam people to participate in the uprising by appearing regularly in the demonstrations and sit-ins that filled the mains squares of the capital city Sanaa and Taiz.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many had hoped that the revolt would help end the cycle of racism that has placed them at the bottom of the social ladder.

==Distribution==

'''Attentional blink''' ('''AB''') is a phenomenon that reflects the temporal costs in allocating selective attention. 
The AB is typically measured by using [[rapid serial visual presentation]] (RSVP) tasks, where participants often fail to detect a second salient target occurring in succession if it is presented between 180-450 ms after the first one. Also, the AB has been observed using two backward-masked targets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ward | first1 = R. | last2 = Duncan | first2 = J. | last3 = Shapiro | first3 = K. | year = 1997 | title = Effects of similarity, difficulty, and nontarget presentation on the time course of visual attention | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 59 | issue = 4| pages = 593–600 | doi=10.3758/bf03211867}}&lt;/ref&gt; and auditory stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnell | first1 = K.

==Research==
The precise adaptive significance behind the attentional blink is unknown, but it is thought to be a product of a two-stage visual processing system attempting to allocate episodic context to targets. In this two-stage system, all stimuli are processed to some extent by an initial parallel stage, and only salient ones are selected for in-depth processing, in order to make optimum use of limited resources at a late serial stage.&lt;ref name="Chun1995"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0096-1523.21.1.109 |vauthors=Chun MM, Potter MC |title=A two-stage model for multiple target detection in rapid serial visual presentation |journal=J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=109–27 |date=February 1995 |pmid=7707027 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/xhp/21/1/109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One curious aspect of attentional blink is that it usually includes "lag 1 sparing", meaning that targets presented ''very'' close together in time (at "lag 1" or consecutively in the RSVP stream) are not affected by the attentional blink, even though items presented at slightly greater lags are significantly impaired. In attentional blink, participants in experiments have trouble reporting multiple targets that are in succession to one another, and will only report one accurately when these targets are presented to them 200ms to 500ms apart according to a study by Visser et al. (2015) .&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, Aug 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; These targets are denoted as T1, T2, etc. The phenomena lag-1 sparing refers to the performance of T2 as opposed to what precedes it, T1. T2 performance was originally hypothesized to be reported far less often and less accurately by participants than T1, because the attention of the participant would still be on T1 while T2 was presented immediately afterwards. Visser also thought that the participants would be too focussed on finding the first target that they would miss the second target completely. However, participants actually did better identifying T2 than they were at identifying T1 when the targets were separated by one or two distractors, denoted also as lags.&lt;ref name="Experimental Psychology 2015. pp. 462-478"&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, Vol 41(2), Apr, 2015. pp. 462-478.&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible explanation for lag-1 sparing is that this phenomenon is heavily interconnected with attentional blink, but does not operate on the same cognitive mechanisms and requires different stimuli to occur. Specifically, for lag-1 sparing to occur, it needs visual input as practice targets. These targets can be numbers or letters presented in rapid succession. When the first target, T1, is presented, it creates an attentional window because of its novelty, meaning that it attracts and holds more attention by the participant. The novelty that wears off between T1 and T2 creates a “boost” in attention and opens a metaphorical window for faster cognition. Participants now know what and how to look for targets, so they find targets more quickly. This attentional widow remains open long enough for T2 to be presented and processed at a much higher rate because of shared characteristics to T1. Targets are normally presented in less than .5 of a second from each other. Lag-1 sparing also occurred regardless of how information was visually presented. Of two RSVP streams— where T1 location was known in the first stream and unknown in the second stream, lag-1 sparing occurred whether T2 was in the same stream as T1, or in a different stream than T1.&lt;ref name="Experimental Psychology 2015. pp. 462-478"/&gt;

There is as yet no conclusive explanation for the phenomenon of lag 1 sparing, although it is thought to be related to the first parallel stage of the two-stage system of stimulus selection and processing.

According to the LC-NE hypothesis,&lt;ref name="Nieuwenhuis2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nieuwenhuis S, Gilzenrat MS, Holmes BD, Cohen JD |title=The role of the locus coeruleus in mediating the attentional blink: a neurocomputational theory |journal=J Exp Psychol Gen |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=291–307 |date=August 2005 |pmid=16131265 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.134.3.291 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/xge/134/3/291}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a salient, or meaningful stimulus is presented, [[neurons]] in the [[locus coeruleus]] release [[norepinephrine]], a neurotransmitter that benefits the detection of the stimulus. The effect of this release lasts for 100 ms after the salient stimulus is presented and benefits the second target when presented immediately after the first one, accounting for lag 1 sparing. Eventually the neurons in the locus coeruleus enter a refractory period, due to the auto-inhibitory effect of norepinephrine. According to the hypothesis, targets presented during this refractory period cannot trigger a release of norepinephrine, resulting in the attentional blink. The episodic distinctiveness hypothesis of the ST2 model&lt;ref name="Bowman2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bowman H, Wyble B |title=The simultaneous type, serial token model of temporal attention and working memory |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=38–70 |date=January 2007 |pmid=17227181 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.114.1.38 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/rev/114/1/38}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the attentional blink reflects a limitation of the visual system attempting to allocate unique episodic contexts to the ephemeral target stimuli presented in RSVP.

The attentional blink can be moderated by changes in visual similarity between targets and distractor stimuli, but it can also be affected by ''conceptual'' similarities, suggesting that stimuli are processed to quite a deep level preconsciously, with much of the resulting information discarded before it reaches consciousness.

The attentional blink is related to, but distinct from the phenomenon of [[repetition blindness]].

Attentional Blink can be used in other studies and experiments as a way to measure attention. A study conducted by Morrison et al. 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=Amanda S.|last2=Brozovich|first2=Faith A.|last3=Lakhan-Pal|first3=Shreya|last4=Jazaieri|first4=Hooria|last5=Goldin|first5=Philippe R.|last6=Heimberg|first6=Richard G.|last7=Gross|first7=James J.|date=2016-03-01|title=Attentional blink impairment in social anxiety disorder: Depression comorbidity matters|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|volume=50|pages=209–214|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2015.08.006|issn=1873-7943|pmid=26370394|pmc=4679612}}&lt;/ref&gt; used AB to measure attentional differences in people with mental disorders such as depression and social anxiety disorder. Measuring AB in the subjects was effective in showing that subjects with those disorders have more difficulty recognizing T2 than others. Another study used the magnitude of AB in order to see whether positive moods affected temporal attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacLean|first=Mary H.|last2=Arnell|first2=Karen M.|last3=Busseri|first3=Michael A.|date=2010-12-01|title=Dispositional affect predicts temporal attention costs in the attentional blink paradigm|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699930903417897|journal=Cognition and Emotion|volume=24|issue=8|pages=1431–1438|doi=10.1080/02699930903417897|issn=0269-9931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotion==
When AB is tested, most often the stimuli presented are inanimate objects. But research shows that not only do inanimate stimuli effect AB but human faces do as well.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eagles|first=Sarah|last2=Murphy|first2=Karen|date=2016-08-01|title=Inverted, Upright, and Blurred Faces Are Not Immune to the Attentional Blink|url=http://pec.sagepub.com/content/45/8/893|journal=Perception|language=en|volume=45|issue=8|pages=893–909|doi=10.1177/0301006616643665|issn=0301-0066}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the hypothesis that configural and featural information are processed by separate channels, thus avoiding AB, human faces in all different configurations, are still processed and affected by AB.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An important factor which influences the AB is the role of emotions. Research has shown that when the second target (T2) in RSVP is an emotionally relevant stimulus it is more likely to be perceived during the attentional blink. The attentional blink is not only modulated by emotional relevance of (T2) but also by the emotional relevance of (T1). In short: when (T1) is emotionally relevant the AB is lengthened, when (T2) is emotionally relevant then the AB is reduced. This research suggests that emotion mediates attention.&lt;ref name="(Schwabe &amp; Wolf, 2010)."&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwabe L, Wolf OT |title=Emotional modulation of the attentional blink: Is there an effect of stress? |journal=Emotion |volume=10 | issue = 2 |pages=283–288|date=April 2010|pmid= |doi= 10.1037/a0017751}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson AK, Phelps EA |title=Lesions of the human amygdala impair enhanced perception of emotionally salient events |journal=Nature |volume=411 |issue=6835 |pages=305–9 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11357132 |doi=10.1038/35077083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sex of the stimuli presented also influences the AB. In a study, it was shown that emotions that are more often than not prescribed to different sexes, were more quickly identified. Not only that, but when the attentional blink would occur, whether it be at lag 1 or lag 2, and how deep of a blink it was, could be manipulated by the sex of and the emotion expressed by T1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stebbins|first=Hilary E.|last2=Vanous|first2=Jesse B.|date=2015-08-01|title=The influence of stimulus sex and emotional expression on the attentional blink|journal=Emotion (Washington, D.C.)|volume=15|issue=4|pages=511–521|doi=10.1037/emo0000082|issn=1931-1516|pmid=26098728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been studies using images as emotional stimuli. Emotionally negative pictures preceding the target by 2 items were found to induce greater deficits in processing the target stimuli than neutral pictures did. Thus, it seems that emotional information can elicit attentional biases which temporarily prevent awareness of actively sought out stimuli.&lt;ref name="Most2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Most S, Chun M, Widders D, Zald D |title=Attentional rubbernecking: Cognitive control and personality in emotion-induced blindness |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin and Review | volume=12 |issue=4 | pages=654–61 |doi=10.3758/BF03196754 |pmid=16447378 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meditation==
A study conducted by Heleen Slagter, Richard Davidson and colleagues, suggests that [[meditation]], particularly [[vipassana]], may reduce the duration of attentional blink. In an experiment, 17 people received three months of intensive training in meditation. Those 17 along with 23 meditation novices performed an attention task in which they successively picked out two numbers embedded in a series of letters. The novices exhibited attentional blink and missed the second number. In contrast, all the trained meditators consistently picked out both numbers. This indicated meditation practice can improve focus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=434D7C62-E7F2-99DF-37CC9814533B90D7 Biello, David (October 2007) ''Searching for God in the Brain'' Scientific American]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011195305/http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=434D7C62-E7F2-99DF-37CC9814533B90D7 |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=meditation-enhances-attention-video Scientific American video blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===The Inhibition Theory===
Raymond et al. (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raymond|first=J.E.|author2=Shapiro, K.L.|author3=Arnell, K.M.|title=Temporary suppression of visual processing in an RSVP task: An attentional blink?|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|volume=18|pages=849–860|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.18.3.849|pmid=1500880|issue=3|date=August 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest that the attentional blink is produced by perceptual uncertainty amongst the target (T1) and following target (T2). They suggest that this confusion happens at some point in the target identification processes. When confusion is eliminated, attentional blink isn’t observed. The researchers also suggested that one way to eliminate confusion is to have items that cannot be named.

===The Interference Theory===
Shapiro et al. (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=K.L.|author2=Raymond, J.E.|author3=Arnell, K.M.|title=Attention to visual pattern information produces the attentional blink in RSVP|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1994|volume=20|pages=357–371|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.20.2.357}}&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest that an interference model may better explain the attentional blink effects than the inhibition model. In this model, the attentional blink is thought to take place because of an out of place item which is selected out of the series because of the interference within the items in the series. Shapiro proposes that the amount of interference increases or decreases with the length of the series.

===The Delay of Processing Theory===
Giesbrecht and Di Lollo (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giesbrecht|first=B|author2=Di Lollo, V.|title=Beyond the attentional blink: Visual marking by object substitution|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=1454–1466|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.24.5.1454}}&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest that the attentional blink over target 2 results when the person is busy processing target 1. It is suggested that anything increasing the difficulty of processing of the first target will result in a greater attentional blink.

===The Attentional Capacity Theory===
Duncan et al. (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=J|author2=Martens, S.|author3=Ward, R.|title=Restricted attention capacity within but not between sensory modalities|journal=Nature|year=1996|volume=387|pages=808–810|pmid=9194561|doi=10.1038/42947|issue=6635}}&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest that the target 1 takes over parts of our attentional capacity, leading to a deficit of processing or recognizing target 2 when presented immediately after target 1. This theory suggests that the time for which target 1 continues to occupy attentional capacity is related directly to the difficulty of processing target 2.

===The Two-Stage Processing Theory===
Chun &amp; Potter (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chun|first=D.M.|author2=Potter, M.C.|title=A two-stage model for multiple target detection in rapid serial visual presentation|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1995|volume=21|pages=109–127|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.21.1.109|pmid=7707027}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that quickly processing a series of items requires two back to back stages. The first stage is the initial rapid-detection. Here, the possible targets are noticed. The second stage is the capacity-limited in which items are taken in order to report later. Stage 2 occurs after the acknowledgement of targets in Stage 1. Here, stage 2 must finishing processing target 1, until then, target 2 will not be recognized in stage 2. If there is a situation where the second target comes in the first stage, the highway to stage two is delayed. Attentional blinking occurs when the second target is in stage 1 which causes a delay. The attentional blink mirror a restriction in the process of combining information from an unstable representation to a stable representation (Johnson &amp; Proctor, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Addie |title=Attention: Theory &amp; Practice |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wwu4W_aO8oAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Attention:+Theory+%26+Practice&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fYWPUq21F8zhsAS59oCgBw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=SAGE |location=Thousand Oaks, California |isbn=9780761927617 |author2=Proctor, Robert |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3661">In [[mathematics]], a '''bitopological space''' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] endowed with ''two'' [[Topological space|topologies]]. Typically, if the set is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and the topologies are &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; then the bitopological space is referred to as &lt;math&gt;(X,\sigma,\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Continuity==

A [[map (mathematics)|map]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f:X\to X'&lt;/math&gt; from a bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; to another bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X',\tau_1',\tau_2')&lt;/math&gt; is called '''continuous''' or sometimes '''pairwise continuous''' if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] both as a map from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X',\tau_1')&lt;/math&gt; and as map from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X',\tau_2')&lt;/math&gt;.

==Bitopological variants of topological properties==
Corresponding to well-known properties of topological spaces, there are versions for bitopological spaces.
* A bitopological space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (X,\tau_1,\tau_2)&lt;/math&gt; is '''pairwise compact''' if each cover &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \{U_i\mid i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle U_i\in \tau_1\cup\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;, contains a finite subcover. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \{U_i\mid i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; must contain at least one member from &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and at least one member from &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;

{{selfref|For the blocking policy on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy]].}}

On the [[Internet]], a '''block''' or '''ban''' is a technical measure intended to restrict access to information or resources. Blocking and its inverse, unblocking, may be implemented by the owners of computers using software.&lt;ref name="Westfall"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.airsassociation.org/services-new/airs-knowledge-network-n/airs-articles/item/119-internet-blocking |title=Internet Blocking |first=Joseph |last=Westfall |year=2012 |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|including China]] and Singapore, block access to certain news information.&lt;ref name="Westfall"/&gt; In the United States, the [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] requires schools receiving federal funded discount rates for Internet access to install [[Content-control software|filter software]] that blocks obscene content, pornography, and, where applicable, content "harmful to minors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fcc.gov/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act |title=Children's Internet Protection Act &amp;#124; FCC.gov  |work=fcc.gov |year=2012 |accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blocking may also refer to denying access to a web server based on the [[IP address]] of the client machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/access.html |title=Access Control - Apache HTTP Server|work=httpd.apache.org |year=2012 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain websites, including [[social networking service|social networks]] such as [[Facebook]] or editable databases like [[Wikimedia project]]s and other [[wiki]]s, users can apply blocks (based in either IP number or account) on other users deemed undesirable to prevent them from performing certain actions. Blocks of this kind may occur for several reasons and produce different effects: in social networks, users can unrestrictedly block other users, typically by preventing them from sending messages or viewing the blocker's information or profile. Privileged users can apply blocks that affect the access of the undesirables to the entire website.

Blocking is used by [[Internet_forum#Moderators|moderators]] and administrators of social media and forums to deny access to users that have broken their rules and will likely do so again, in order to ensure a peaceful and orderly discussion place. Common reasons for blocking are [[spamming]], [[trolling]], and [[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]]. Some criticize cases of the use of bans by administrators of large websites, such as [[Twitter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/07/20/twitter-bans-milo-yiannopoulos-for-good-while-cracking-down-on-abuse/ |title=Twitter bans conservative writer Milo Yiannopoulos for good, while cracking down on abuse|year=2016 |accessdate=15 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that these bans may be politically or financially motivated. However, websites have a legal right to decide who is allowed to post, and users often respond by [[Foot voting|"voting with their feet"]] and going to a place where the administrators see their behavior as acceptable.

==Effects==
Blocked users may be completely unable to access all or part of a site's content, which is usually the case when censoring or filtering mechanisms are responsible for the block. Under a [[Stealth banning|stealth ban]], a user is given the false impression that their content is still being posted to the site, when in reality it is being hidden from all other users.

==Evasion==

Ban evasion is the act of attempting to get around a ban, whether temporary or permanent, on a website.

Alternate accounts set up by people evading bans from websites are referred to as [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppets]]. Typically, if someone is caught evading a ban with a sockpuppet, the sockpuppet account is banned. If the original ban was temporary, it may be extended or even made permanent. Sometimes, the user's [[IP address]] may be banned as well so the user cannot access the site or create new accounts. Some sites may remove all but a few traces of the ban-evader. [[TV Tropes]] and [[Wikipedia]], for example, may mass-delete any pages created by a ban-evader.

Ban evasion can be detected by tracing a user's IP address. If two accounts are using the same IP address, it could be a sign of ban evasion. Also, the use of a [[VPN]], shown by rapid, drastic changes of IP address by the same user in a short period of time, can also be a sign that the user was trying to get around a ban. Ban evasion can also be spotted if posts or other contributions from two accounts look the same or similar, or on sites where the same email can be associated with multiple accounts, identical or similar emails can be a sign of ban evasion. Users who have been permanently banned for ban evasion may not be able to appeal their ban, which is the case on sites such as TV Tropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/WhatToDoIfYouAreSuspended|title=What to Do If You Are Suspended / Administrivia|website=Tvtropes.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When creating sockpuppets, ban evaders use a variety of tactics to disguise the fact that the new account was created by a previously banned user, such as using new names, an alternate email address, [[Virtual private network|VPNs]] or [[proxy server]]s to mask their IP address, changing their IP address (sometimes only needing to rely on a dynamic IP address to automatically change it after a time), or using the site from public Internet access locations such as schools and libraries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6080">In [[mathematics]], a '''bundle''' is a generalization of a [[fiber bundle]] dropping the condition of a local product structure. The requirement of a local product structure rests on the bundle having a [[topological space|topology]]. Without this requirement, more general objects can be considered bundles. For example, one can consider a bundle π: ''E''→ ''B'' with ''E'' and ''B'' [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. It is no longer true that the [[preimage]]s &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; must all look alike, unlike fiber bundles where the fibers must all be [[isomorphic]] (in the case of [[vector bundle]]s) and [[homeomorphic]].

== Definition ==
A bundle is a triple {{math|(''E'', ''p'', ''B'')}} where {{math|''E'', ''B''}} are sets and {{math|''p'':''E''→''B''}} a map.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Husemoller|1994}} p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{math|''E''}} is called the '''total space'''
*{{math|''B''}} is the '''base space''' of the bundle
*{{math|''p''}} is the '''projection'''

This definition of a bundle is quite unrestrictive. For instance, the [[empty function]] defines a bundle. Nonetheless it serves well to introduce the basic terminology, and every type of bundle has the basic ingredients of above with restrictions on {{math|''E'', ''p'', ''B''}} and usually there is additional structure.

For each {{math|''b'' ∈ ''B'', ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b'')}} is the '''fibre''' or '''fiber''' of the bundle over {{math|''b''}}.

A bundle {{math|(''E*'', ''p*'', ''B*'')}} is a '''subbundle''' of {{math|(''E'', ''p'', ''B'')}} if {{math|''B*'' ⊂ ''B'', ''E*'' ⊂ ''E''}} and {{math|''p*'' {{=}} ''p''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''E*''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

A [[Section (fibre bundle)|cross section]] is a map {{math|''s'':''B'' → ''E''}} such that {{math|''p''(''s''(''b'')) {{=}} ''b''}} for each {{math|''b'' ∈ ''B''}}, that is, {{math|''s''(''b'') ∈ ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b'')}}.

== Examples ==
*If {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''B''}} are [[smooth manifold]]s and {{math|''p''}} is smooth, [[Surjective function|surjective]] and in addition a [[Submersion (mathematics)|submersion]], then the bundle is a [[fibered manifold]]. Here and in the following examples, the smoothness condition may be weakened to continuous or sharpened to analytic, or it could be anything reasonable, like continuously differentiable ({{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}), in between.
*If for each two points {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the base, the corresponding fibers {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are [[homotopy equivalent]], then the bundle is a [[fibration]].
*If for each two points {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the base, the corresponding fibers {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are [[homeomorphic]], and in addition the bundle satisfies certain conditions of ''local triviality'' outlined in the pertaining linked articles, then the bundle is a [[fiber bundle]]. Usually there is additional structure , e.g. a [[group structure]] or a [[Vector space#Definition|vector space structure]], on the fibers besides a topology. Then is required that the homeomorphism is an isomorphism with respect to that structure, and the conditions of local triviality are sharpened accordingly.
*A [[principal bundle]] is a fiber bundle endowed with a right [[group action]] with certain properties. One example of a principal bundle is the [[frame bundle]].
*If for each two points {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the base, the corresponding fibers {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are [[vector space]]s of the same dimension, then the bundle is a [[vector bundle]] if the appropriate conditions of local triviality are satisfied. The [[tangent bundle]] is an example of a vector bundle.

==Bundle objects==
More generally, bundles or '''bundle objects''' can be defined in any [[category (mathematics)|category]]: in a category '''C''', a bundle is simply an [[epimorphism]] π: ''E'' → ''B''.  If the category is not [[concrete category|concrete]], then the notion of a preimage of the map is not necessarily available. Therefore these bundles may have no fibers at all, although for sufficiently well behaved categories they do; for instance, for a category with [[pullback (category theory)|pullbacks]] and a [[initial object|terminal object]] 1 the points of ''B'' can be identified with morphisms ''p'':1→''B'' and the fiber of ''p'' is obtained as the pullback of ''p'' and π. The category of bundles over ''B'' is a subcategory of the [[slice category]] ('''C'''↓''B'') of objects over ''B'', while the category of bundles without fixed base object is a subcategory of the [[comma category]] (''C''↓''C'') which is also the [[functor category]] '''C'''², the category of [[morphism]]s in '''C'''.

The category of smooth vector bundles is a bundle object over the category of smooth manifolds in '''Cat''', the [[category of small categories]].  The [[functor]] taking each manifold to its [[tangent bundle]] is an example of a section of this bundle object.

&lt;!--NOTE: If you intend to add any information about the caduceus as a medical symbol, please read this article and 'Rod of Asclepius' article in their entirety first, as there is much confusion between the two. Any uncited contribution referring to the caduceus as a medical symbol will be removed per WP:CITE and WP:V.--&gt;
[[File:Caduceus.svg|thumb|upright|Modern depiction of the caduceus as the symbol of commerce]]
[[File:Hermes Ingenui Pio-Clementino Inv544.jpg|thumb|upright|''Hermes Ingenui''&lt;ref&gt;It is unclear whether the inscription refers to a patron who paid for the statue, or to the sculptor of the statue.&lt;/ref&gt; carrying a winged ''caduceus'' upright in his left hand. A Roman copy after a Greek original of the 5th century BCE ([[Museo Pio-Clementino]], [[Rome]]).]]

The '''caduceus''' (☤; {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|dj|uː|ʃ|ə|s|,_|-|s|i|ə|s}}; [[Latin]] ''cādūceus'', from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κηρύκειον}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|kērū́keion}}'' "herald's wand, or staff")&lt;ref&gt;The Latin word ''{{lang|la|cādūceus}}'' is an adaptation of the Greek word, itself derived from {{lang|grc|κῆρυξ}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|kêrux}}'' "messenger, herald, envoy". Liddell and Scott, ''Greek-English Lexicon''; Stuart L. Tyson, "The Caduceus", ''The Scientific Monthly'', '''34'''.6, (1932:492–98) p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; is the staff carried by [[Hermes]] in [[Greek mythology]] and consequently by [[Hermes Trismegistus]] in Greco-Egyptian mythology. The same staff was also borne by heralds in general, for example by [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], the messenger of [[Hera]]. It is a short staff entwined by two [[Serpent (mythology)|serpents]], sometimes surmounted by wings.  In Roman iconography, it was often depicted being carried in the left hand of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the messenger of the gods, guide of the dead, and protector of merchants, shepherds, gamblers, liars, and thieves.&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, Spawforth, ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', third ed., Oxford 1996, p. 690 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some accounts suggest that the oldest known imagery of the caduceus have their roots in a Mesopotamian origin with the Sumerian god [[Ningishzida]] whose symbol, a staff with two snakes intertwined around it, dates back to 4000 B.C. to 3000 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman, "The Quest for Hermes Trismigestus", 2011, Chapter 3, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a symbolic object, it represents Hermes (or the Roman Mercury), and by extension trades, occupations, or undertakings associated with the god. In later [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], the caduceus provided the basis for the [[Astrological symbols|astrological symbol]] representing the [[Mercury (planet)|planet Mercury]]. Thus, through its use in [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and [[astronomy]] it has come to denote the [[Mercury (planet)|planet]] and [[Mercury (element)|elemental metal]] of the same name. It is said the wand would wake the sleeping and send the awake to sleep. If applied to the dying, their death was gentle; if applied to the dead, they returned to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension of its association with Mercury and Hermes, the caduceus is also a recognized symbol of commerce and negotiation, two realms in which balanced exchange and reciprocity are recognized as ideals.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the Unicode standard, where the "staff of Hermes" signifies "a commercial term or commerce"; see also: Walter J. Friedlander, ''The Golden Wand of Medicine: A History of the Caduceus Symbol in Medicine'', Greenwood, 1992, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As one specialized study of symbolism notes, "In modern times the caduceus figures as a symbol of commerce, since [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] is the god of commerce. M. Oldfield Howey, ''The Encircled Serpent: A Study of Serpent Symbolism in All Countries And Ages'', New York, 1955, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This association is ancient, and consistent from the Classical period to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;"The name of the god Mercury cannot be disassociated from the word ''merx'', which means merchandise. Such was the sentiment of the ancients" Yves Bonnefoy (Ed.), Wendy Doniger (Trans.), ''Roman and European Mythologies'', University of Chicago Press, 1992, p. 135; "Mercury was the Roman name for the Greek god Hermes. His Latin name was apparently derived from merx or mercator, a merchant." Michael E. Bakich, ''The Cambridge Planetary Handbook'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 85; Latin ''merx'' is the root of the English words Commerce, Market, Mart, Mercantile, Mercenary, Mercer, Merchant and Mercury, as can be seen by referring to any dictionary including etymological information.&lt;/ref&gt; The caduceus is also used as a symbol representing printing, again by extension of the attributes of Mercury (in this case associated with writing and eloquence).

The caduceus is often incorrectly used [[Caduceus as a symbol of medicine|as a symbol of healthcare organizations and medical practice]], particularly in [[North America]], due to confusion with the traditional medical symbol, the [[Rod of Asclepius]], which has only one snake and is never depicted with wings.

==Origin and comparative mythology==
{{further information|Serpent worship}}
[[File:Lekythos of Hermes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hermes hastens bearing his ''kerukeion'', on an [[Attica|Attic]] [[lekythos]], c. 475 BC, attributed to the [[Tithonos Painter]]]]
[[File:Longane, Sicily.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|Bronze caduceus of a lost civilisation that developed along the ancient [[Longanus]] river in Sicily]]

[[File:Winged goddess Cdm Paris 392.jpg|thumb|Iris with the caduceus in detail from an Attic [[red-figure]] [[pelike]], middle of fifth century BC ([[Agrigento]], Sicily)]]

It is thought that this symbol's long lasting association with the medical profession stems from early use of twigs to draw out long bodied inter muscular parasitic worms by wrapping them slowly around the twig so as not to break them or allow them to escape back into the body, a successful treatment still in use today, see [[Dracunculiasis]].{{Citation needed|reason=This has no citation, and sounds like it might be false or at best the thought of a single researcher|date=March 2018}}

The term ''kerukeion'' denoted any herald's staff, not necessarily associated with Hermes in particular.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', third edition, ed. Hornblower and Spawforth, ''s.v.'' "Hermes".&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of the cult of Hermes, [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] (1909) assumed that the two snakes had simply developed out of ornaments of the shepherd's crook used by heralds as their staff.&lt;ref&gt;Farnell, ''[[The Cults of the Greek States]]'', vol. 5, p. 20, cited in Tyson 1932:494.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been rejected by later authors pointing to parallel iconography in the Ancient Near East. It has been argued that the staff or wand entwined by two snakes was itself representing a god in the pre-anthropomorphic era. Like the [[herma|herm]] or [[priapus]], it would thus be a predecessor of the anthropomorphic Hermes of the classical era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. L. Frothingham|title=Babylonian Origin of Hermes the Snake-God, and of the Caduceus I|work=American Journal of Archaeology|volume= 20, No. 2 (April–June, 1916)|pages= 175–211| jstor=497115}} Frothingham characterizes Farnell's simplistic view of the origin of the symbol as a "frivolous and futile theory".&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The serpent-staff is in origin a symbolic depiction of the [[world pillar]] and the [[world serpent]].
The addition of a second serpent in the staff of Hermes is usually connected to an element of [[hermaphroditism]].

===Ancient Near East===
[[File:Caduceus on Mauryan coin.jpg|thumb|Caduceus symbol on a [[punch-marked coin]] of king [[Ashoka]] in [[India]], third to second century BC]]

[[William Hayes Ward]] (1910) discovered that symbols similar to the classical caduceus sometimes appeared on [[Mesopotamian cylinder seals]]. He suggested the symbol originated some time between 3000 and 4000 BC, and that it might have been the source of the Greek caduceus.&lt;ref&gt;William Hayes Ward, ''The Seal Cylinders of Western Asia'', Washington, 1910&lt;/ref&gt; A.L. Frothingham incorporated Dr. Ward's research into his own work, published in 1916, in which he suggested that the prototype of Hermes was an "Oriental deity of Babylonian extraction" represented in his earliest form as a snake god. From this perspective, the caduceus was originally representative of Hermes himself, in his early form as the Underworld god [[Ningishzida]], "messenger" of the "Earth Mother".&lt;ref&gt;A.L. Frothingham, "Babylonian Origins of Hermes the Snake-God, and of the Caduceus", in ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 20, No. 2, pp. 175–211&lt;/ref&gt;
The caduceus is mentioned in passing by [[Walter Burkert]]&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' 1985: II.2.8, p. 158; Burkert notes H. Frankfort, in ''Iraq'', '''1''' (1934:10) and E.D. van Buren, in ''Archiv für Orientforschung'', '''10''' (1935/36:53-65).&lt;/ref&gt; as "really the image of copulating snakes taken over from Ancient Near Eastern tradition".

In Egyptian iconography, the [[Djed]] pillar is depicted as containing a snake in a frieze of the [[Dendera Temple complex]].

===India===
The caduceus also appears as a symbol of the [[punch-marked coins]] of the [[Maurya Empire]] in India, in the third or second century BC. Numismatic research suggest that this symbol was the symbol of the Buddhist king [[Ashoka]], his personal "[[Mudra]]".&lt;ref&gt;Damodar Dharmanand Kosambi, ''Indian Numismatics'', Orient Longman, New Delhi 1981, p. 73 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=favxZII9WtwC&amp;pg=PA73 online]).&lt;/ref&gt; This symbol was not used on the pre-Mauryan punch-marked coins, but only on coins of the Maurya period, together with the [[arched-hill symbol|three arched-hill symbol]], the "peacock on the hill", the [[triskelis]] and the [[Taxila]] mark.&lt;ref&gt;Kailash Chand Jain, ''Malwa Through the Ages. From the Earliest Time to 1305 A.D.'', Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi et al. 1972, p. 134 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=_3O7q7cU7k0C&amp;pg=PA134 online]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical antiquity==
===Mythology===
[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Vettii - Ixion.jpg|thumb|Punishment of [[Ixion]]: in the center is [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] holding the caduceus and on the right [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] sits on her throne. Behind her [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]] stands and gestures. On the left is [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] ([[blond]] figure) standing behind the wheel, manning it, with Ixion already tied to it. [[Nephele]] sits at Mercury's feet; a Roman fresco from the eastern wall of the [[triclinium]] in the [[House of the Vettii]], [[Pompeii]], [[Pompeian Styles|Fourth Style]] (60–79 AD).]]

The [[Homeric hymn]] to Hermes relates how Hermes offered his lyre fashioned from a tortoise shell as compensation for the [[cattle raid|cattle he stole]] from his half brother [[Apollo]]. Apollo in return gave Hermes the caduceus as a gesture of friendship.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson 1932:494.&lt;/ref&gt;
The association with the serpent thus connects Hermes to [[Apollo]], as later the serpent was associated with [[Asclepius]], the "son of Apollo".&lt;ref&gt;Deldon Anne McNeely ''Mercury rising: women, evil, and the trickster gods'', Spring Publications, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-88214-366-8}}, p. 90.
"Homer tell us that Hermes' caduceus, the golden wand, was acquired by Hermes from Apollo in exchange for the tortoise-lyre; later the caduceus changed hands again from Hermes to Apollo's son, Asclepius."&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of Apollo with the serpent is a continuation of the older [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] [[dragon]]-slayer motif. [[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher]] (1913) pointed out that the serpent as an attribute of both Hermes and Asclepius is a variant of the "pre-historic semi-chthonic serpent hero known at Delphi as [[Python (mythology)|Python]]", who in classical mythology is slain by Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=S. Davis (citing W. H. Roscher, ''Omphalos'' (1913))|title=Argeiphontes in Homer – The Dragon-Slayer, ''Greece &amp; Rome'' Vol. 22, No. 64 (Feb., 1953), pp. 33–38|jstor= 640827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Greek [[Etiology|myth of origin]] of the caduceus is part of the story of [[Tiresias]],&lt;ref name=blayney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drblayney.com/Asclepius.html|title=The Caduceus vs the Staff of Asclepius|last=Blayney|first=Keith|date=September 2002|accessdate=2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; who found two snakes copulating and killed the female with his staff.  Tiresias was immediately turned into a woman, and so remained until he was able to repeat the act with the male snake seven years later.  This staff later came into the possession of the god Hermes, along with its transformative powers.

Another myth suggests that Hermes (or Mercury) saw two serpents entwined in mortal combat. Separating them with his wand he brought about peace between them, and as a result the wand with two serpents came to be seen as a sign of peace.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson 1932:495&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, [[Livy]] refers to the ''caduceator'' who negotiated peace arrangements under the diplomatic protection of the caduceus he carried.&lt;ref&gt;Livy: [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]], 31,38,9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
In some vase paintings ancient depictions of the Greek ''kerukeion'' are somewhat different from the commonly seen modern representation. These representations feature the two snakes atop the staff (or rod), crossed to create a circle with the heads of the snakes resembling horns. This old graphic form, with an additional crossbar to the staff, seems to have provided the basis for the graphical [[sign of Mercury]] (☿) used in  [[Greek astrology]] from Late Antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;"Signs and Symbols Used In Writing and Printing", p 269, in ''Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language'', unabridged, New York, 1953. Here the symbol of the planet Mercury is indicated as "the caduceus of Mercury, or his head and winged cap".&lt;/ref&gt;

Caduceus is encoded in [[Unicode]] at code point U+2624: ☤.

===Symbol of commerce===
A simplified variant of the caduceus is to be found in dictionaries, indicating a “commercial term” entirely in keeping with the association of Hermes with commerce. In this form the staff is often depicted with two winglets attached and the snakes are omitted (or reduced to a small ring in the middle).&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the Unicode standard, where the "staff of Hermes" signifies "a commercial term or commerce".&lt;/ref&gt; The Customs Service  of the former [[German Democratic Republic]]  employed the caduceus, bringing its implied associations with thresholds, translators, and commerce, in the service medals they issued their staff. The caduceus is also the symbol of the Customs Agency of Bulgaria. The emblem of the China Customs is a caduceus crossing with a golden key.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zhengzhou.customs.gov.cn/publish/portal106/tab1641/module5966/info3560.htm 海关关徽].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''Clifford–Klein form''' is a [[double coset]] space

:&amp;Gamma;\''G''/''H'',

where ''G'' is a [[Semisimple Lie group|reductive]] [[Lie group]], ''H'' a closed subgroup of ''G'', and Γ a [[discrete subgroup]] of G that acts [[properly discontinuously]] on the [[homogeneous space]] ''G''/''H''.  A suitable discrete subgroup Γ may or may not exist, for a given ''G'' and ''H''. If Γ exists, there is the question of whether Γ\''G''/''H'' can be taken to be a [[compact space]], called a '''compact Clifford–Klein form'''.

When ''H'' is  itself compact, classical results show that a compact Clifford–Klein form exists. Otherwise it may not, and there are a number of negative results.

{{Globalize/Australia|date=December 2010}}
A '''Club Championship''' system is a sports competition where more than one team is fielded by clubs in the competition. An example of its use is in club [[rugby football|rugby]] and cricket competitions in [[Australia]] where clubs may have several grades.

A club championship is useful because it allows a comparison of the entire club's strength against another, rather than merely looking at, for example, first grade results. Because it allows a comparison of the entire club's strength, club championships are often used where there is a promotion/relegation system in place.

This means that a club which is strong throughout the grades will be in a better position than one which has only one or two strong teams. In a club championship system each grade's results are weighted, with the higher grades receiving more points, preventing clubs from flooding their lower grades with top players at the end of a season and shoring up their club championship results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4490">[[Image:Cone.svg|right|thumb|250px|Cone of a circle. The original space is in blue, and the collapsed end point is in green.]]
In [[topology]], especially [[algebraic topology]], the '''cone''' ''CX'' '''of a [[topological space]]''' ''X'' is the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]]:

:&lt;math&gt;CX = (X \times I)/(X \times \{0\})&lt;/math&gt;

of the [[product topology|product]] of ''X'' with the [[unit interval]] ''I'' = [0, 1]. 
Intuitively, this construction makes ''X'' into a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] and collapses one end of the cylinder to a [[point (topology)|point]].

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Compact space|compact]] subspace of [[Euclidean space]], the cone on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[union (set theory)|union]] of segments from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to any fixed point &lt;math&gt; v \not\in X &lt;/math&gt; such that these segments intersect only by &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; itself. That is, the topological cone agrees with the geometric cone for compact spaces when the latter is defined. However, the topological cone construction is more general.

==Examples==
Here we often use geometric cone (defined in the introduction) instead of the topological one. The considered spaces are compact, so we get the same result up to homeomorphism.

* The cone over a point ''p'' of the real line is the interval {''p''} x [0,1].
* The cone over two points {0,1} is a "V" shape with endpoints at {0} and {1}.
* The cone over a closed interval ''I'' of the real line is a filled-in [[triangle]] (with one of the edges being ''I''), otherwise known as a 2-simplex (see the final example). 
* The cone over a [[polygon]] ''P'' is a pyramid with base ''P''.
* The cone over a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] is the solid [[cone (geometry)|cone]] of classical geometry (hence the concept's name).
* The cone over a [[circle]] given by
::&lt;math&gt;\{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb R^3 \mid x^2 + y^2 = 1 \mbox{ and } z=0\}&lt;/math&gt;
is the curved surface of the solid cone:
::&lt;math&gt;\{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb R^3 \mid x^2 + y^2 = (z-1)^2 \mbox{ and } 0\leq z\leq 1\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:This in turn is homeomorphic to the closed [[disc (mathematics)|disc]].
* In general, the cone over an [[n-sphere]] is homeomorphic to the closed (''n''+1)-[[ball (mathematics)|ball]].
* The cone over an ''n''-[[simplex]] is an (''n''+1)-simplex.

==Properties==

All cones are [[path-connected space|path-connected]] since every point can be connected to the vertex point. Furthermore, every cone is [[contractible]] to the vertex point by the [[homotopy]]

:''h''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''s'') = (''x'', (1&amp;minus;''t'')''s'').

The cone is used in algebraic topology precisely because it embeds a space as a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of a contractible space.

When ''X'' is [[compact space|compact]] and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (essentially, when ''X'' can be embedded in Euclidean space), then the cone ''CX'' can be visualized as the collection of lines joining every point of ''X'' to a single point. However, this picture fails when ''X'' is not compact or not Hausdorff, as generally the [[quotient topology]] on ''CX'' will be [[finer topology|finer]] than the set of lines joining ''X'' to a point.

== Cone functor ==
The map &lt;math&gt;X\mapsto CX&lt;/math&gt; induces a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;C:\mathbf{Top}\to\mathbf {Top}&lt;/math&gt; on the [[category of topological spaces]] '''Top'''. If &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;is a continuous map, then &lt;math&gt;Cf : CX \to CY&lt;/math&gt;is defined by &lt;math&gt;(Cf)([x,t])=[f(x),t]&lt;/math&gt;, where square brackets denote equivalence classes.

==Reduced cone==
If &lt;math&gt;(X,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[pointed space]], there is a related construction, the '''reduced cone''', given by 
:&lt;math&gt;(X\times [0,1]) / (X\times \left\{0\right\}
\cup\left\{x_0\right\}\times [0,1])&lt;/math&gt;

where we take the basepoint of the reduced cone to be the equivalence class of  &lt;math&gt;(x_0,0)&lt;/math&gt;. With this definition, the natural inclusion  &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto (x,1)&lt;/math&gt; becomes a based map.  This construction also gives a functor, from the category of pointed spaces to itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8564">In [[differential geometry]], one can attach to every point ''x'' of a [[smooth manifold|smooth (or differentiable) manifold]] a [[vector space]] called the '''cotangent space''' at ''x''. Typically, the cotangent space is defined as the [[dual space]] of the [[tangent space]] at ''x'', although there are more direct definitions (see below). The elements of the cotangent space are called '''cotangent vectors''' or '''tangent covectors'''.

==Properties==
All cotangent spaces on a connected manifold have the same [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]], equal to the dimension of the manifold. All the cotangent spaces of a manifold can be "glued together" (i.e. unioned and endowed with a topology) to form a new differentiable manifold of twice the dimension, the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.

The tangent space and the cotangent space at a point are both real vector spaces of the same dimension and therefore [[isomorphic]] to each other via many possible isomorphisms. The introduction of a [[Riemannian metric]] or a [[symplectic form]] gives rise to a [[natural isomorphism]] between the tangent space and the cotangent space at a point, associating to any tangent covector a canonical tangent vector.

==Formal definitions==

===Definition as linear functionals===

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''x'' be a point in ''M''. Let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' be the [[tangent space]] at ''x''. Then the cotangent space at ''x'' is defined as the [[dual space]] of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'':
:''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' = (''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
Concretely, elements of the cotangent space are [[linear functional]]s on ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''. That is, every element α ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' is a [[linear map]]
:&amp;alpha; : ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' &amp;rarr; '''F'''
where '''F''' is the underlying [[field (mathematics)|field]] of the vector space being considered. For example, the field of [[real number]]s. The elements of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' are called cotangent vectors.

===Alternative definition===

In some cases, one might like to have a direct definition of the cotangent space without reference to the tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of [[equivalence class]]es of smooth functions on ''M''. Informally, we will say that two smooth functions ''f'' and ''g'' are equivalent at a point ''x'' if they have the same first-order behavior near ''x'', analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions ''f'' and ''g'' have the same first order behaviour near ''x'' if and only if the derivative of the function ''f''-''g'' vanishes at ''x''. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near ''x''.

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''x'' be a point in ''M''. Let ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; be the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of all functions in C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') vanishing at ''x'', and let ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; be the set of functions of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_i f_i g_i\,&lt;/math&gt;, where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are real vector spaces and the cotangent space is defined as the [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

This formulation is analogous to the construction of the cotangent space to define the [[Zariski tangent space]] in algebraic geometry. The construction also generalizes to [[locally ringed space]]s.

==The differential of a function==

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''f'' ∈ C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') be a [[smooth function]]. The differential of ''f'' at a point ''x'' is the map
:d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'')
where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]] at ''x'', thought of as a derivation. That is &lt;math&gt;X(f)=\mathcal{L}_Xf&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lie derivative]] of ''f'' in the direction ''X'', and one has d''f''(''X'')=''X''(''f'').  Equivalently, we can think of tangent vectors as tangents to curves, and write
:d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;gamma;&amp;prime;(0)) = (''f'' o &amp;gamma;)&amp;prime;(0)
In either case, d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a linear map on ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' and hence it is a tangent covector at ''x''.

We can then define the differential map d : C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') → ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' at a point ''x'' as the map which sends ''f'' to d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Properties of the differential map include:

# d is a linear map: d(''af'' + ''bg'') = ''a'' d''f'' + ''b'' d''g'' for constants ''a'' and ''b'',
# d(''fg'')&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(''x'')d''g''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''g''(''x'')d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;,

The differential map provides the link between the two alternate definitions of the cotangent space given above. Given a function ''f'' ∈ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (a smooth function vanishing at ''x'') we can form the linear functional d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; as above. Since the map d restricts to 0 on ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (the reader should verify this), d descends to a map from ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to the dual of the tangent space, (''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. One can show that this map is an isomorphism, establishing the equivalence of the two definitions.

==The pullback of a smooth map==

Just as every differentiable map ''f'' : ''M'' → ''N'' between manifolds induces a linear map (called the ''pushforward'' or ''derivative'') between the tangent spaces
:&lt;math&gt;f_{*}^{}\colon T_x M \to T_{f(x)} N&lt;/math&gt;
every such map induces a linear map (called the ''[[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]'') between the cotangent spaces, only this time in the reverse direction:
:&lt;math&gt;f^{*}\colon T_{f(x)}^{*} N \to T_{x}^{*} M&lt;/math&gt;
The pullback is naturally defined as the dual (or transpose) of the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]]. Unraveling the definition, this means the following:
:&lt;math&gt;(f^{*}\theta)(X_x) = \theta(f_{*}^{}X_x)&lt;/math&gt;
where θ ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''f''(''x'')&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''N'' and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''. Note carefully where everything lives.

If we define tangent covectors in terms of equivalence classes of smooth maps vanishing at a point then the definition of the pullback is even more straightforward. Let ''g'' be a smooth function on ''N'' vanishing at ''f''(''x''). Then the pullback of the covector determined by ''g'' (denoted d''g'') is given by
:&lt;math&gt;f^{*}\mathrm dg = \mathrm d(g \circ f).&lt;/math&gt;
That is, it is the equivalence class of functions on ''M'' vanishing at ''x'' determined by ''g'' o ''f''.

==Exterior powers==

The ''k''-th [[exterior power]] of the cotangent space, denoted Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M''), is another important object in differential geometry. Vectors in the ''k''th exterior power, or more precisely sections of the ''k''-th exterior power of the [[cotangent bundle]], are called [[differential form|differential ''k''-forms]]. They can be thought of as alternating, [[multilinear map]]s on ''k'' tangent vectors. 
For this reason, tangent covectors are frequently called ''[[one-form]]s''.

{{confused|alternate history}}

'''Counterfactual history''', also sometimes referred to as '''virtual history''', is a form of [[historiography]] that attempts to answer "[[wikt:what if|what if]]" questions known as [[counterfactuals]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bunzl, "Counterfactual History: A User's Guide," ''American Historical Review'' (2004) 109#3 pp. 845–858 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/530560 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Black and MacRaild provide this definition: "It is, at the very root, the idea of conjecturing on what did not happen, or what might have happened, in order to understand what did happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy Black|author2=Donald M. MacRaild|title=Studying History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQZeAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=125|isbn=9780230364929}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method seeks to explore history and historical incidents by means of extrapolating a timeline in which certain key historical events did not happen or had an outcome which was different from that which did in fact occur. It has produced a [[literary genre]] which is variously called [[alternate history|alternative history]], [[speculative fiction|speculative history]], or hypothetical history.&lt;ref name = "Arnold" /&gt;

One goal is to estimate the relative importance of a specific event, incident or person. For instance, to the counterfactual claim "What would have happened had [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] drunk [[coffee]] instead of [[tea]] on the afternoon he committed suicide?", the timeline would have remained unchanged—Hitler in all likelihood still would have committed suicide on April 30, 1945, regardless of what he had to drink that afternoon. However, to the counterfactual "What would have happened had Hitler died in the [[20 July plot|July 1944 assassination attempt]]?", all sorts of possibilities become readily apparent, starting with the assumption that the German generals, had they been able to consolidate power over remaining Nazi functionaries such as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] and [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], would probably have sued for peace, bringing an early end to [[World War II]]. (Historians generally feel popular support for the Party was still very strong in July 1944, and the party apparatus of Himmler, Goebbels, [[Albert Speer|Speer]], [[Martin Bormann|Bormann]], [[Hermann Göring|Göring]] etc. would survive even an assassination of Hitler.) Thus, the counterfactual brings into sharp relief the question of how important Hitler was as an individual and how his personal fate shaped the course of the war and, ultimately, of world history.

==Development==
Although there are [[Victorian era|Victorian]] examples of counterfactual history, it was not until the very late 20th century that the exploration of counterfactuals in history was to begin in earnest.

An early example is ''[[If It Had Happened Otherwise]]'' (1931) which features a contribution by [[Winston Churchill]] who examined what would have happened had [[Robert E. Lee]] won at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 |title=If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg |first=Winston |last=Churchill |authorlink=Winston Churchill |publisher=The Churchill Centre |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105132718/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 |archivedate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this volume is notable for featuring imagined histories by serious historians, the histories are presented in narrative form (in most cases with a fairly whimsical tone) without any analysis of the reasoning behind these scenarios, so they fall short of modern standards for serious counterfactual history and are closer to the fictional [[alternate history]] genre.

A significant foray into treating counterfactual scenarios seriously was made by the economic historian [[Robert Fogel]]. In his 1964 book ''[[Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History]]'', Fogel tried to use quantitative methods to imagine what the U.S. economy would have been like in 1890 had there been no railroads.&lt;ref name="eh.net"&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History – Book Reviews ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228010214/http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml |date=2006-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fogel hypothesizes that, in the absence of the railroad, America’s large canal system would have been expanded and its roads would have been improved through pavement; both of these improvements would take away from the social impact of the railroad. He estimates that “the level of per capita income achieved by January 1, 1890 would have been reached by March 31, 1890, if railroads had never been invented.”&lt;ref name="eh.net"/&gt;

Few further attempts to bring counterfactual history into the world of academia were made until the 1991 publication of ''[[Plausible Worlds|Plausible Worlds: Possibility and Understanding in History and the Social Sciences]]'' by the Cambridge sociologist [[Geoffrey Hawthorn]], who carefully explored three different counterfactual scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Frederic |last=Smoler |title=Past Tense |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/past-tense |journal=American Heritage |date=September 1999 |volume=50 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work helped inspire ''[[Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals]]'' (1997), a collection of essays exploring different scenarios by a number of historians, edited by the historian [[Niall Ferguson]]. Ferguson has become a significant advocate of counterfactual history, using counterfactual scenarios to illustrate his objections to deterministic theories of history such as [[Marxism]], and to put forward a case for the importance of contingency in history, theorizing that a few key changes could result in a significantly different modern world. A series of [[What If? (essays)|"What If?"]] books edited by [[Robert Cowley]] presented dozens of essays by historians or prominent writers about "how a slight turn of fate at a decisive moment could have changed the very annals of time."&lt;ref name = "Arnold"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/books/making-books-the-what-ifs-that-fascinate.html?src=pm|title=Making books: The 'What Ifs' that fascinate|last=Arnold|first=Martin|date=December 21, 2000|work=New York Times|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that a counterfactual is not as much a matter of what happened in the past but it is the disagreement about which past events were most significant. For example, William Thompson employs a sequence of counterfactuals for eight lead economies that have driven [[globalization]] processes for almost a thousand years. From [[Song dynasty]] in China to [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]], and claims that each actor in succession played an unusually critical role in creating a structure of leadership that became increasingly global in scope across time.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson. W. The Lead Economy Sequence in World Politics (From Sung China to the United States): Selected Counterfactuals. Journal of Globalization Studies. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2010. pp. 6–28 [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/126971/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences from alternate history===
Counterfactual history is neither [[historical revisionism]] nor [[alternate history]].

Counterfactual history distinguishes itself through its interest in the very incident that is being negated by the counterfactual, thus seeking to evaluate the event's relative historical importance. Such historians reason arguments for each change, outlining changes in broad terms only, as befits a mere byproduct of the exercise.

An alternate history writer, on the other hand, is interested precisely in the hypothetical scenarios that flow from the negated incident or event. A fiction writer is thus free to invent very specific events and characters in the imagined history.

The line is sometimes blurred as historians may invent more detailed timelines as illustrations of their ideas about the types of changes that might have occurred. But it is usually clear what general types of consequences the author thinks are reasonable to suppose would have been likely to occur, and what specific details are included in an imagined timeline only for illustrative purposes.

The line is further blurred by novelists such as [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], whose alternate-history novel ''[[The Years of Rice and Salt]]'' has a character talking of historians' use of counterfactuals, within the novel's alternate history. He dismisses this as "a useless exercise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/riceandsalt.htm|title=Kim Stanley Robinson: The Years of Rice and Salt – an infinity plus review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Most historians regard counterfactual history as perhaps entertaining, but not meeting the standards of mainstream historical research due to its speculative nature. Advocates of counterfactual history often respond that all statements about [[causality]] in history contain implicit counterfactual claims—for example, the claim that a certain military decision helped a country win a war presumes that if that decision had not been made, the war would have been less likely to be won, or would have been longer.

Since counterfactual history is such a recent development, a serious, systematic critique of its uses and methodologies has yet to be made, as the movement itself is still working out those methods and frameworks.

Aviezer Tucker has offered a range of criticism of this approach to the study of the past both in his review of Ferguson's ''Virtual History in History and Theory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/0018-2656.00090 |title=Historiographical Counterfactuals and Historical Contingency |journal=History and Theory |volume=38 |number=2 |pages=264–276 |date=May 1999 |last=Tucker |first=Aviezer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his book ''Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1171466/?site_locale=en_GB |title=Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography |last=Tucker |first=Aviezer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-83415-5 |doi=10.2277/0521834155}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has [[Richard J. Evans]] in his book ''Altered Pasts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/altered-pasts-counterfactuals-in-history-by-richard-j-evans/2012202.article|title=Altered Pasts: Counterfactuals in History, by Richard J.

{{Jainism}}
Jain texts assign a wide range of meaning to the [[Sanskrit]] '''''dharma''''' or [[Prakrit]] '''''dhamma'''''. It is often translated as “religion” and as such, [[Jainism]] is called ''Jain Dharma'' by its adherents. 

In Jainism, the word ''Dharma'' is used to refer the following:
#Religion
#Dharma as a [[dravya (Jainism)|dravya]] (substance or a reality) (the principle of motion)
#The true nature of a thing
#Ten virtues like forgiveness, etc. also called ten forms of Dharma

== Religion ==
Usage of the word ''dharma'' in reference to the religion.

===Ahimsa as Dharma===

{{Main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}

According to Jain texts, Ahimsa is the greatest Dharma (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः [ahiṃsā paramo dharmaḥ]: "non-violence is the highest religion") and there is no religion equal to the religion of non-violence.

=== Dharma bhāvanā ===
Jain texts prescribe meditation on twelve forms of reflection (''bhāvanā'') for those who wish to stop the influx of ''karmas'' that extend transmigration.{{sfn|C.R. Jain|1929|p=52}} One such reflection is ''Dharma bhāvanā''-
{{quote|The faith promulgated by Jina is characterized by non- injury, based on truth, with humility as its root, forbearance as its strength, safeguarded by celibacy, dominated by quietism and characterized by restraint and non-attachment as its support. Without attaining it living beings have been wandering in the beginningless mundane existence, undergoing sufferings and misery owing to the rise of inauspicious karmas. If true faith is attained, one is bound to achieve emancipation, after enjoying several kinds of worldly prosperity and distinction. This is contemplating what is stressed in religion. This promotes constant devotion to religion. (12){{sfn|Jain|2012|p=154}}}}

=== Conduct ===

In Jainism, the ''dharma'' (conduct or path) of the householder ([[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvaka]]) is distinguished from the conduct of an ascetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra |author2=Sagarmal Jain |others=T.K. Tukol; K.K. Dixit (trans.) | title =Samaṇ Suttaṁ | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }} verse  296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acarya Haribhadra, Dharmabindu&lt;/ref&gt; Sravaka-dharma is the religious path for the virtuous householders, where charity and worship are the primary duties. The dharma of a householders consists of observance of twelve vows i.e. five minor vows and seven disciplinary vows.
Sramana-dharma is the religious path of the virtuous ascetics, where mediatation and study of scriptures is their primary duty. The religion of monks consists of five ''[[Mahavrata]]s'' or great vows. They are endowed with right faith, right knowledge and right conduct and engaged in complete self-restraint and penances.

==The nature of a substance==
According to Jainism, Universe and its constituents are uncreated and everlasting. These constituents behave according to the natural laws and their nature without interference from external entities. Dharma or true religion according to Jainism is ''vatthu sahāvo dhammo'' translated as "the intrinsic nature of a substance is its true dharma."

==Dharma substance==
Dharma is one of the  six substances constituting the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra |author2=Sagarmal Jain |others=T.K. Tukol; K.K. Dixit (trans.) | title =Samaṇ Suttaṁ | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }} Verse 624&lt;/ref&gt; These substances are – Dharma  (medium of motion),  Adharma (medium of rest), Akasa (space), kala (time), Pudgala (matter) and Jiva (soul). Since Dharma as a substance extends and pervades entire universe, it is also known as Dharmastikaya. It helps the matter and souls in movement. It itself is not motion, but is a medium of motion. Adharma is opposite of Dharma i.e. it assists the substances like soul and matter to rest.

==Samyaktva - Rationality of perception, knowledge and conduct==
{{Main|Ratnatraya}}
According to Jainism, ''[[Samyak darsana]]'' (Rational Perception), ''Samyak jnana'' (Rational Knowledge) and ''Samyak caritra'' (Rational Conduct) collectively also known as ''Ratnatraya'' or the "Three Jewels of Jainism" constitute the path to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Kuhn  | first =Hermann  | title =Karma, The Mechanism : Create Your Own Fate  | publisher =Crosswind Publishing  | year =2001  | location =Wunstorf, Germany  | isbn =3-9806211-4-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samyak Darsana''' or rational perception is the rational faith in the true nature of every substances of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Samyak Jnana''' or rational knowledge is the right knowledge of true and relevant knowledge of the reality, the tattvas. It incorporates the two principles of  [[Anekantvada]] or non-absolutism and [[Syadvada]] or relativity of truth. Right knowledge must be free from three main defects: doubt, delusion, and indefiniteness. '''Samyak Caritra''' or rational conduct is the natural conduct of a (soul) living being. It consists in following austerities, engaging in right activities and observance of vows, carefulness and controls.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra |author2=Sagarmal Jain |others=T.K. Tukol; K.K. Dixit (trans.) | title =Samaṇ Suttaṁ | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }} Verse 262 - 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ten Virtues as Dharma==

According to the Jain text, [[Tattvarthsutra]], following are the ten virtues (''das-dharma'').{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=146}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra |author2=Sagarmal Jain |others=T.K. Tukol; K.K. Dixit (trans.) | title =Samaṇ Suttaṁ | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }} verse 84&lt;/ref&gt;-
#Supreme forgiveness
#Supreme humility
#Supreme straightforwardness
#Supreme truthfulness
#Supreme purity
#Supreme self-restraint
#Supreme penance
#Supreme renunciation
#Supreme non-possessiveness
#Supreme celibacy

'''Elder rights''' are the [[rights]] of the aged, who in the [[United States]] are not recognized as a constitutionally [[protected class]].&lt;ref name=mitchellreview&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kohn|first1=Nina|title=The Lawyer's Role in Fostering an Elder Rights Movement|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|date=2010|volume=37|page=51|url=http://web.wmitchell.edu/law-review/wp-content/uploads/Volume37/documents/Kohn.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Common rights issues faced by elders include age-related job [[discrimination]] (such as forced age of retirement), lack of access to medical treatments because of age or age-related obstacles, societal perceptions of ability/disability due to age,&lt;ref name="mitchellreview"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and vulnerability to abuse, including financial, physical, psychological, social, and sexual&lt;ref name=srv&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Rights – Elder Abuse|url=http://seniorsrights.org.au/your-rights/|website=Senior Rights Victoria|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of diminished capacity and lack of access to/ability to use technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protecting Elders' Rights|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/caringforyourparents/handbook/legalissues/protectingeldersrights.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elder rights movement==
The concept of a unique set of needs and rights of the elderly started in 1930s during the [[Great Depression]] with the main focus being on the need for a national pension program to provide financial security to the no longer working elderly.&lt;ref name=walls&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walls|first1=David|title=Elders Rights Movement|url=http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/wallsd/elders-rights-movement.shtml|publisher=Sonoma State University|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous rival plans (the [[Townsend Plan]], the [[McClain Movement]], the [[Ham and Eggs Movement]]) were made to address the issue.  Eventually, as part of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], the [[Social Security Act]] was passed to meet the need.

As the [[population ageing|population aged]] and the aged grew wealthier throughout the second half of the twentieth century, their political influence increased.&lt;ref name='walls'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as the [[American Association of Retired Persons]] and government bodies such as the [[Administration on Aging]] were created to meet their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pratt|first1=Henry|title=The Gray Lobby: Politics of Old Age|date=1976|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues far beyond simple financial security became the focus{{snd}}[[Maggie Kuhn]], angered over her mandatory retirement at 65, launched the [[Gray Panthers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laursen|first1=Eric|title=Gray Panthers|url=http://www.globalaging.org/elderrights/us/2009/panthers.htm|website=Global Action on Aging|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Elder Law Foundation]] was created out of concern that elderly might have unique legal needs.&lt;ref name="nelf"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 reauthorization of the [[Older Americans Act]] included a project called [[Choices for Independence]] to develop consumer-directed community-based (as opposed to congregate segregated choices such as traditional nursing homes) long-term care options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elder Rights Background Documents|url=http://www.globalaging.org/elderrights/us/index.htm|website=Global Action on Aging|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Employee Monitoring''' is the act of employers [[surveillance|surveying]] [[employee]] activity through different surveillance methods. Organizations engage in employee monitoring for different reasons such as to track [[Performance management|performance]], to avoid legal liability, to protect [[trade secrets]], and to address other security concerns. This practice may impact [[Job satisfaction|employee satisfaction]] due to its impact on the [[privacy|privacy of the employees]]. Among organizations, the extent and methods of employee monitoring differ.[1]

== Surveillance Methods ==

Due to the use of company computers, telephones, workspaces, and software, employers can have access to the daily activities of their employees. These devices are used to monitor the organizations' employees. Common methods of monitoring include software monitoring, telephone tapping, video surveillance, email monitoring, and location monitoring.

'''Software monitoring''' can occur if employees use company computers for their work, companies often utilize employee monitoring software that allows them to track what their employees are doing on the computers. Such as, what the speed of typing is, what mistakes are made, what applications were used, and what specific keys were pressed.

{{Main articles|Employee monitoring software}}

'''Telephone tapping''' can be used to recover employees' phone call details and conversations. These can be recorded during monitoring. The number of calls, the duration of each call, and the idle time between calls, can all go into an automatic log for analysis by the company.&lt;ref&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/231233456&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main articles|Telephone tapping}}

'''Video surveillance''' can provide video feed of employee activities that are passed through to a central location where they are monitored live by another person. These can be recorded and stored for future reference which some believe is the most accurate way to monitor employees. "This is a benefit because it provides an unbiased method of performance evaluation and prevents the interference of a manager's feelings in an employee's review (Mishra and Crampton, 1998)." Management can review the performance of an employee by checking the surveillance to detect and potentially prevent problems.[1]

{{Main articles|Video Surveillance}}

'''Email monitoring''' gives employers the ability to look at email messages sent or received by their employees. Emails can be viewed and recovered even if they had been previously deleted. In the United States, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act provides some privacy protections regarding monitoring of employees' email messages and other electronic communications. See Electronic Communications Privacy Act § Employee Privacy.

{{Main articles|Email Surveillance}}

'''Location monitoring''' can occur and be used for employees that do not work in a static location. Supervisors may choose to track their location. Common examples of companies that use location monitoring are delivery and transportation industries. In some of these cases, the employee monitoring is incidental as the location is tracked for other purposes, that can help improve customer satisfaction. Employees' phone call details and conversations can be recorded during monitoring. The number of calls, the duration of each call, and the idle time between calls, can all go into an automatic log for analysis by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SHERMAN |first=MARK |title=GOV'T OBTAINS WIDE AP PHONE RECORDS IN PROBE |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-obtains-wide-ap-phone-records-probe |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514001309/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-obtains-wide-ap-phone-records-probe |archivedate=May 14, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Key logging''', or keystroke logging, is a process that records the keys a user is typing on the keyboard in order. These programs can also capture screenshots when triggered by predefined keywords. Some see it as violating workplace privacy and it's also notorious for being used with malicious intent. Loggers collect and store passwords, bank account information, private messages, credit card numbers, PIN numbers, and usernames.

==Legality==
Employee monitoring often is in conflict with [[workplace privacy|employees' privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mishra, J. M. |author2= Crampton, S. M. |last-author-amp=yes |year=1998|title=Employee monitoring: Privacy in the workplace?|journal=SAM Advanced Management Journal (07497075)|volume=63 |issue=3 |page=4|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-21160636.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monitoring often collects work-related activities, but it can also collect employee's personal information that is not linked to their work. Monitoring in the workplace may put employers and employees at odds because both sides are trying to protect personal interests. Employees want to maintain their privacy while employers want to ensure company resources aren't misused. In any case, companies can maintain ethical monitoring policies by avoiding indiscriminate monitoring of employees' activities.&lt;ref&gt; Burks, F. ''Ethical Issues &amp; Employer Monitoring Internet Usage''. Chron.com, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The employee needs to understand what is expected of them while the employer needs to establish that rule.

With employee monitoring, there are many guidelines that one must follow and put in place to protect the company and the individual. Some following cases are ones that have shaped the certain rules and regulations that are in effect today. For instance, in Canada, it is illegal to perform invasive monitoring, such as reading an employee's emails, unless it can be shown that it is a necessary precaution and there are no other alternatives. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rules-employees-have-right-to-privacy-on-work-computers/article4625660/&lt;/ref&gt; In Maryland, everyone in the conversation must give consent before the conversation can be recorded. The state of California requires that the monitored conversations have a beep at certain intervals or there must be a message informing the caller that the conversations may be recorded. However, this does not inform the company representative which calls are being recorded. Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Colorado and New Jersey have laws relating to when a conversation can be recorded. "Lawyers generally advise that one way for businesses to avoid liability for monitoring employees’ online activities is to take all necessary steps to eliminate any reasonable expectation of privacy that employees may have concerning their use of company email and other communications systems." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiakm.org/ojakm/articles/2013/volume1_2/OJAKM_Volume1_2pp44-55.pdf], Yerby, Johnathan. "Legal and Ethical Issues of Employee Monitoring." ''Online Journal of Applied Knowledge Management''. &lt;/ref&gt; Businesses makes employee monitoring a known tool that supervisors use to avoid any potential legal issues that may arise. They will announce this during new hire orientation, in a staff meeting, or even in a workplace contract that employees sign either at the time of hire or after a form of misconduct.

==Legal Uses==

Businesses use employee monitoring for various reasons. The follow is a list that includes, but is not limited to:

* Find needed business information when the employee is not available.
* Protect [[data security|security]] of proprietary information and data.
* Prevent or investigate possible criminal activities by employees.
* Prevent personal use of employer facilities.
* Check for violations of company policy against sending an offensive or pornographic email.
* Investigate complaints of [[workplace harassment|harassment]].
* Check for illegal software.

According to Computer Monitoring: The Hidden War Of Control,"The employer of today has the ability and legal right to read e-mail, review files stored on a company computer, examine computer usage, and track individual employee computer activities. The idea of anonymous actions is an illusion. Every action between a network and the computers connected to it can be tracked. Every action by an individual worker on a computer can be tracked, analyzed and used against the employee. The protections and freedoms guaranteed by the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] are there to protect the individual from the Government and do not generally apply to the normal employee/employer relationship."&lt;ref&gt;Kevin, P. P., &amp; Tammy, Y. A. (2011). Computer monitoring: The hidden war of control. International Journal of Management and Information Systems, 15(1), 49-58. Retrieved from http://journals.cluteonline.com/index.php/IJMIS/article/view/1595&lt;/ref&gt; To benefit the business, employers have the ability to monitor employees whenever they feel is necessary.

==Legal Issues==
In January 2016, European Court of Human Rights issued a landmark ruling in the case of Bărbulescu v Romania (61496/08) regarding monitoring of employees’ computers. The employee Mr. Bărbulescu accused the employer of violating his rights to ‘private life’ and ‘correspondence’ set in the Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"itemid":["001-159906"]}/|author=EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, JUDGMENT |title= CASE OF BĂRBULESCU v. ROMANIA (Application no. 61496/08) |date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
But the Court stated that the employer had every right to monitor the employee’s computer in this case due to the fact that such monitoring was implemented to ensure that there is no breach of company policy. This historic ruling has confirmed that it is not unreasonable for employers to monitor their employees’ computer activity and such monitoring does not violate their human rights.

A year later, in July 2017, German court also ruled that computer monitoring of employees is reasonable but the use of keylogging software is excessive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/companies-cant-use-keyloggers-to-spy-on-employees-says-german-court/|author=Catalin Cimpanu|title= Companies Can't Use Keyloggers to Spy on Employees, Says German Court |date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Employee monitoring software developers warn that in each case it is still recommended to advise a legal representative and the employees should give a written agreement with such monitoring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clevercontrol.com/companies-monitor-employees/#Problems_with_Law |title= How Companies Monitor Their Employees |date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of instances are a case by case situation and is hard to treat all the issues and problems as one. With the ever growing laws, employers shape their guidelines around the new rules and regulations that are formed in court cases.

==Financial benefits==
Employee Monitoring can be used to monitor the safety and productivity of the employees but it also may help businesses financially. From the dishonest unethical employee who steals time and money from the business to the redefining of unprofitable processes in monitoring employee actions, employee monitoring allows for the growth of financial profits from a small investment. The monitoring of employees can help in the protection of employees and it can help as protection in litigation by employees for job-related issues such as failing to perform, illegal activities and harassment claims. According to the American Management Association, almost half (48%) of the companies surveyed use video monitoring to counter theft, violence, and sabotage. Only 7% use video surveillance to track employees' on-the-job performance. Most employers notify employees of anti-theft video surveillance (78%) and performance-related video monitoring (89%), (Retrieved from the article The Latest on Workplace Monitoring and Surveillance on humanresources.about.com)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Training Solutions for Individuals, Organizations and Government Agencies |url=http://humanresources.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;zTi=1&amp;sdn=humanresources&amp;cdn=money&amp;tm=27&amp;f=00&amp;su=p284.13.342.ip_p554.23.342.ip_&amp;tt=2&amp;bt=4&amp;bts=4&amp;zu=http%3A//www.amanet.org/ }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in ''Labour Economics'', it has been argued that forbidding employers to track employees' on-the-job performance can make economic sense according to efficiency wage theory, while surveillance to prevent illegal activities should be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Workplace surveillance, privacy protection, and efficiency wages|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537104000764|journal = Labour Economics|date = 2005|pages = 727–738|volume = 12|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.labeco.2004.06.001|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An indirect way that companies can be affected financially through employee monitoring is that they can be sure they are billing clients correctly. According to "Business 2 Community", inaccurately billing clients is very possible because of the human error. These inaccuracies can cause a dispute between a company and a client which could eventually lead to the client terminating its business with the company. This sort of termination will not only hurt the company's revenue stream but also its reputation with other clients or potential clients. The suggested solution to this problem is a time tracking software to correctly monitor the number of hours a client spends with an employee. &lt;ref&gt; {https://www.business2community.com/human-resources/6-benefits-of-employee-monitoring-0134730}, Vessella, Victoria. "6 Benefits of Employee Monitoring." ''Business 2 Community''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnathan Yerby said, "The enormity of potential productivity loses, as reported by Court (2004), is approximately one million dollars
annually for a company with 500 employees surfing the Internet for just a half hour a day." &lt;ref&gt;{http://www.iiakm.org/ojakm/articles/2013/volume1_2/OJAKM_Volume1_2pp44-55.pdf], Yerby, Johnathan. "Legal and Ethical Issues of Employee Monitoring." ''Online Journal of Applied Knowledge Management''.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does employee monitoring prevent theft of money and resources, but it also prevents theft of time and to make sure people are doing what they are supposed to be doing in the workplace. This is used a lot during the Holidays with online shopping, as well as during [[March Madness]]. Employees will spend their time using their work time for personal uses and employee monitoring helps regulate this.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21045">'''Equation-free modeling''' is a method for [[multiscale computation]] and [[computer-aided analysis]]. It is designed for a class of complicated systems in which one observes evolution at a macroscopic, coarse scale of interest, while accurate models are only given at a finely detailed, microscopic, level of description. The framework empowers one to perform macroscopic computational tasks (over large space-time scales) using only appropriately initialized microscopic simulation on short time and small length scales. The methodology eliminates the derivation of explicit macroscopic [[evolution equation]]s when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form; hence the term equation-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last1=Kevrekidis |first1=I.G.|authorlink=Yannís G. Kevrekidis |last2=Samaey |first2=G. |year=2009 |title=Equation-free multiscale computation: algorithms and applications |journal=Annual Review of Physical Chemistry |volume=60 |pages=321–344 |doi=10.1146/annurev.physchem.59.032607.093610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
In a wide range of chemical, physical and biological systems, coherent macroscopic behavior emerges from interactions between microscopic entities themselves (molecules, cells, grains, animals in a population, agents) and with their environment. Sometimes, remarkably, a coarse-scale differential equation model (such as the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] for fluid flow, or a [[reaction-diffusion system]]) can accurately describe macroscopic behavior.  Such macroscale modeling makes use of general principles of conservation (atoms, particles, mass, momentum, energy), and closed into a well-posed system through phenomenological [[constitutive equations]] or [[equations of state]].  However, one increasingly encounters [[complex systems]] that only have known microscopic, fine scale, models. In such cases, although we observe the emergence of coarse-scale, macroscopic behavior, modeling it through explicit closure relations may be impossible or impractical. [[Non-Newtonian fluid]] flow, [[chemotaxis]], [[porous media]] transport, [[epidemiology]], brain modeling and neuronal systems are some typical examples.  Equation-free modeling aims to use such microscale models to predict coarse macroscale emergent phenomena.

Performing coarse-scale computational tasks directly with fine-scale models is often infeasible: direct simulation over the full space-time domain of interest is often computationally prohibitive. Moreover,  modeling tasks, such as numerical bifurcation analysis, are often impossible to perform on the fine-scale model directly: a coarse-scale steady state may not imply a steady state for the fine-scale system, since individual molecules or particles do not stop moving when the gas density or pressure become stationary. Equation-free modeling circumvents such problems by using short bursts of appropriately initialized fine-scale simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Kevrekidis, I.G. |year=2003 |title=Equation-free, coarse-grained multiscale computation: enabling microscopic simulators to perform system-level tasks |journal=Comm. Math. Sciences |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=715–762 |mr=2041455 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The coarse time-stepper==
Dynamic problems invoke the coarse time-stepper.   In essence, short bursts of computational experiments with the fine-scale simulator estimate local time derivatives. Given an initial condition for the coarse variables &lt;math&gt;U(t_k)&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt;, the coarse time-stepper involves four steps:

* Lifting, creates microscale initial conditions &lt;math&gt;u(t_k)&lt;/math&gt;, consistent with the macrostate &lt;math&gt;U(t_k)&lt;/math&gt;;
* Simulation, uses the microscale simulator to compute the microscale state &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; at over a short interval &lt;math&gt;t_k\leq t \leq t_k+\delta t&lt;/math&gt;;
* Restriction, obtains the macrostate &lt;math&gt;U(t_k+\delta t)&lt;/math&gt; from the fine-scale state &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt;;
* the Time-step, extrapolation of macrostate &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t_{k+1}=t_k+\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; predicts the state a macrotime in the future.

Multiple time steps simulates the system into the macro-future.
If the microscale model is stochastic, then an ensemble of microscale simulations may be needed to obtain sufficiently good extrapolation in the time step.  Such a coarse time-stepper may be used in many algorithms of traditional continuum numerical analysis, such as numerical bifurcation analysis, optimization, control, and even accelerated coarse-scale simulation.

Traditionally, algebraic formulae determine time derivatives of the coarse model. In our approach, the macroscale derivative is estimated by the inner microscale simulator, in effect performing a closure on demand.  A reason for the name ''equation-free'' is by analogy with matrix-free numerical linear algebra;&lt;ref&gt;C. T. Kelley. ''Iterative Methods for linear and nonlinear equations'', SIAM, Philadelphia, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; the name emphasizes that  macro-level equations are never constructed explicitly in closed form.

===Restriction===
The restriction operator often follows directly from the specific choice of the macroscale variables. For example, when the microscale model evolves an ensemble of many particles, the restriction typically computes the first few moments of the particle distribution (the density, momentum, and energy).

===Lifting===
The lifting operator is usually much more involved. For example, consider a particle model: we need to define a mapping from a few low order moments of the particle distribution to initial conditions for each particle. The assumption that a relation exists that closes in these low order, coarse, moments, implies that the detailed microscale configurations are functionals of the moments (sometimes referred to as slaving &lt;ref&gt;H. Haken. Slaving principle revisited. ''Physica D'', 97:95–103, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;).  We assume this relationship is established/emerges on time scales that are fast compared to the overall system evolution (see [[slow manifold]] theory and applications &lt;ref&gt;A. J. Roberts. Effectively model dynamics, deterministic and stochastic, across multiple space and time scales. In J. G. Hartnett and P. C. Abbott, editors, ''Frontiers of Fundamental and Computational Physics: 10th International Symposium'', volume 1246, pages 75–87. AIP, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Unfortunately, the closure (slaving relations) are algebraically unknown (as otherwise the coarse evolution law would be known).

Initializing the unknown microscale modes randomly introduces a lifting error: we rely on the separation of macro and micro time scales to ensure a quick relaxation to functionals of the coarse macrostates (healing). A preparatory step may be required, possibly involving microscale simulations constrained to keep the macrostates fixed.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Ryckaert, G. Ciccotti, and H. Berendsen. Numerical integration of the Cartesian equation of motion of a system with constraints: molecular dynamics of N-alkanes. ''J. Comput. Phys.'', 23:237, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; When the system has a unique fixed point for the unknown microscale details conditioned upon the coarse macrostates,  a constrained runs algorithm may perform this preparatory step using only the microscale time-stepper.&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Gear, T. J.  Kaper, I. G. Kevrekidis, and A. Zagaris. Projecting to a Slow Manifold: Singularly Perturbed Systems and Legacy Codes. ''SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems'' 4(3):711–732, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===An illustrative example===
A toy problem illustrates the basic concepts.  For example, consider the [[differential equation]] system for two variables &lt;math&gt;(U(t),u(t))&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dt}=-U-u+2\,,\quad \frac{du}{dt}=100(U^3-u).&lt;/math&gt;
Capital &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; denotes the presumed macroscale variable, and lowercase &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; the microscale variable. This classification means that we assume a coarse model of the form &lt;math&gt;dU/dt=G(U)&lt;/math&gt; exists, although we do not necessarily know what it is.   Arbitrarily define the lifting from any given macrostate &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;(U,u)=(U,0.5)&lt;/math&gt;. A simulation using this lifting and the coarse time-stepper is shown in the figure.
[[File:EquationFreeProjectiveIntegration.png|400px|thumb|Equation-free coarse time-stepper applied to the illustrative example differential equation system using &lt;math&gt;\delta t=0.1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U(0)=-1&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The solution of the differential equation rapidly moves to the [[slow manifold]]  &lt;math&gt;u\approx U^3&lt;/math&gt; for any initial data. The coarse time-stepper solution would agree better with the full solution when the 100 factor is increased. The graph shows the lifted solution (blue solid line) &lt;math&gt;(U,u)&lt;/math&gt;. At times &lt;math&gt;t=n\delta t&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is restricted and then lifted again, which here is simply setting &lt;math&gt;u(n\delta t)=0.5&lt;/math&gt;. The slow manifold is shown as a  red line. The right plot shows the time derivative of the restricted solution as a function of time (blue curve), as well as the time derivative &lt;math&gt;dU/dt&lt;/math&gt; (the coarse time derivative), as observed from a full simulation (red curve).

===On application to concrete multiscale problems===
The equation-free approach has been applied to many examples. The examples illustrate the various ways to construct and assemble the algorithmic building blocks.  Numerical analysis establishes the accuracy and efficiency of this approach. Additional numerical analysis  on other methods of this type has also been done.&lt;ref&gt;W. E and B. Engquist (2003). The heterogeneous multiscale methods ''Comm. Math. Sciences'' 1(1):87–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the equation-free paradigm to a real problem requires considerable care, especially defining the lifting and restriction operators, and the appropriate outer solver.

* The first challenge is to identify the macroscale observables.  They need to be complete enough so that the unknown microscale variables can be reliably reconstructed (lifted).  Physical arguments often the identify the macroscale observables.  Almost always one invokes densities, but there are some surprisingly simple examples where correlation functions are essential macroscale variables.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Young, A. J. Roberts, and G. Stuhne. Reproductive pair correlations and the clustering of organisms. Nature, 412:328–331, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; If not resorting to physical arguments, then modern data-mining or manifold learning techniques, such as Isomap or diffusion maps, may obtain the macroscale variables from microscale simulation.&lt;ref&gt;R. R. Coifman et al. (2005). Geometric diffusions as a tool for harmonic analysis and structure definition of data: Diffusion maps Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 102(21):7426–7431.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There should be a clear separation between the time-scales of the macroscale observables and the time-scales of the remaining microscale modes quasi-equilibrate given any macrostate.
* Knowing the macroscale observables might not be sufficient.  One strategy to obtain such information is the baby-bathwater scheme which uses only appropriately initialized simulations.&lt;ref&gt;J. Li, P. G. Kevrekidis, C. W. Gear and I. G. Kevrekidis (2003). Deciding the nature of the coarse equation through microscopic simulations: the baby-bathwater scheme ''SIAM Multiscale Modeling and Simulation'' 1(3):391–407.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coarse bifurcation analysis==
The recursive projection method&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Schroff and H.B. Keller (1993). Stabilization of unstable procedures: the recursive projection method ''SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis'' 30: 1099–1120.&lt;/ref&gt; enables the computation of [[bifurcation diagram]]s using legacy simulation code.  It also empowers the coarse time-stepper to perform equation-free bifurcation computations.  Consider the coarse time stepper in its effective form
:&lt;math&gt;\vec U^{n+1}=\vec S(\vec U^n,\lambda; \delta t),&lt;/math&gt;
which includes explicit dependence upon one or more parameters &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.  Bifurcation analysis computes [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibria]] or [[periodic orbit]]s, their stability and dependence upon parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

Compute a coarse equilibrium as a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the coarse time stepper
:&lt;math&gt;\vec U-\vec S(\vec U,\lambda; \delta t)=\vec 0.&lt;/math&gt;
In the equation-free context, the recursive projection method is the outer solver of this equation, and the coarse time-stepper enables this method to be performed using fine scale dynamics.

Additionally, for problems where the macroscale has continuous symmetries, one can use a template based approach &lt;ref&gt;C. Rowley and J. Marsden (2000). Reconstruction equations and the Karhunen–Loève expansion for systems with symmetry ''Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena'' 142: 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; to compute coarse [[self-similar]] or [[travelling wave]] solutions as fixed points of a coarse time-stepper that also encodes appropriate rescaling and/or shifting of space-time and/or solution.
For example, self-similar diffusion solutions may be found as the [[probability density function]] of detailed [[molecular dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Chen, P. Debenedetti, C.W. Gear, and I.G. Kevrekidis (2004). From molecular dynamics to coarse self-similar solutions: a simple example using equation-free computation ''Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics'' 120: 215–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to the recursive projection method is to use Newton—Krylov methods.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Kelley (1995). ''Iterative Methods for linear and nonlinear equations'' SIAM, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coarse projective integration==

The coarse time stepper accelerates simulation over large macroscale times. In the scheme described above, let the large macro-time-step &lt;math&gt;\Delta t\gg\delta t&lt;/math&gt;, and be on the time scale of the slow coarse dynamics.  Let the computed &lt;math&gt;U^n\approx U(n\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the coarse variable, and let the microscale simulation compute &lt;math&gt;U^{n,k}\approx U(n\Delta t+k\delta t)&lt;/math&gt; from a local time simulation with initial condition that the coarse variable &lt;math&gt;U(n\Delta t)=U^n=U^{n,0}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we approximate &lt;math&gt;U((n+1)\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt; via extrapolating over a gap by
:&lt;math&gt;U^{n+1}=U^{n,k}+(\Delta t-k\delta t)F(\vec U^n)&lt;/math&gt;
where, for example, simple linear extrapolation would be 
:&lt;math&gt;F(\vec U^n)=(U^{n,k}-U^{n,k-1})/\delta t&lt;/math&gt;
This scheme is the called coarse projective forward Euler, and is the simplest in the class.

The &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; steps taken before the extrapolation reflect that we must allow the system to settle onto a quasi-equilibrium (from the microscale point of view), so that we can make a reliable extrapolation of the slow dynamics.  Then the size of the projective integration step is limited by stability of the slow modes.&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Gear and I.G. Kevrekidis. Projective methods for stiff differential equations: problems with gaps in their eigenvalue spectrum . ''SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing'' 24(4):1091–1106, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher order versions of coarse projective integration can be formed, analogous to [[Adams–Bashforth method|Adams–Bashforth]] or [[Runge–Kutta]].&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Gear; I.G. Kevrekidis and  Theodoropoulos. Coarse integration/bifurcation analysis via microscopic simulators: micro-Galerkin methods ''Computers and Chemical Engineering'' 26: 941–963, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher order schemes for systems where the microscale noise is still apparent on the macroscale time step are more problematic.&lt;ref&gt;X. Chen, A. J. Roberts, and I. G. Kevrekidis. Projective integration of expensive multiscale stochastic simulation. In W. McLean and A. J. Roberts, editors, ''Proceedings of the 15th Biennial Computational Techniques and Applications Conference, CTAC-2010, volume 52 of ANZIAM J.'', pages C661–C677, Aug. 2011. http://journal.austms.org.au/ojs/ index.php/ANZIAMJ/article/view/3764&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patch dynamics==

The spatial analogue of projective integration is the gap-tooth scheme.
The idea of the gap-tooth scheme is to perform simulations of small patches of space, the teeth, separated by unsimulated space, the gaps.
By appropriately coupling the small patches of simulations we create a large scale, coarse level, simulation of the spatially extended system.
When the microscale simulator is computationally expensive the gap-tooth scheme empowers efficient large scale prediction.
Furthermore, it does this without us ever having to identify an algebraic closure for a large scale model.
&lt;ref&gt;Kevrekidis, I.G. et al. (2003). Equation-free, coarse-grained multiscale computation: enabling microscopic simulators to perform system-level tasks ''Comm. Math. Sciences'' 1(4): 715–762.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samaey, G.; Roose, D. and Kevrekidis, I.G. (2005). The gap-tooth scheme for homogenization problems ''SIAM Multiscale Modeling and Simulation'' 4: 278–306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts2007"&gt;Roberts, A.J. and Kevrekidis, I.G. (2007). General tooth boundary conditions for equation free modelling ''SIAM J. Scientific Computing'' 29(4): 1495–1510.&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of the gap-tooth scheme with coarse projective integration is called patch dynamics.

===Coupling boundary conditions===

The key to the gap-tooth and patch scheme is the coupling of the small patches across unsimulated space.
Surprisingly, the generic answer is to simply use classic Lagrange interpolation, whether in one dimension&lt;ref name="Roberts2007"/&gt; or multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Roberts, T. MacKenzie, and J. Bunder. A dynamical systems approach to simulating macroscale spatial dynamics in multiple dimensions. ''J. Engineering Mathematics'', 86(1):175–207, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  This answer is related to the coupling in [[holistic discretization]] and theoretical support provided by the theory of [[slow manifold]]s.
The interpolation provides value or flux boundary conditions as required by the microscale simulator.  
High order consistency between the macroscale gap-tooth/patch scheme and the microscale simulation is achieved through high order Lagrange interpolation.

However, commonly the microscale is a noisy particle based or [[agent-based model]].
In such cases the relevant macroscale variables are averages such as mass and momentum density. 
Then one generally has to form averages over a core of each tooth/patch, and apply the coupling condition over a finite action region on the edges of each tooth/patch.
The provisional recommendation is to make these regions as big as half the tooth/patch.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Bunder, A. J. Roberts, and I. Kevrekidis. Better buffers for patches in macroscale simulation of systems with microscale randomness. Technical report, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1415], Dec 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
That is, for efficiency one makes the microscale tooth/patch as small as possible, but limited by the need to fit in action and core regions big enough to form accurate enough averages.

===Lifting===

Patch dynamics is the combination of the gap-tooth scheme and coarse projective integration.  Just as for normal projective integration, at the start of each burst of microscale simulation, one has to create an initial condition for each patch that is consistent with the local macroscale variables, and the macroscale gradients from neighboring interpolated patches.  The same techniques suffice.

==Open problems and future directions==

Assumptions and choices about the macroscale evolution are crucial in the equation-free scheme.  The key assumption is that the variables we choose for the macroscale coupling must effectively close on the chosen macroscale.  If the chosen macroscale length is too small then more coarse scale variables may be needed: for example, in fluid dynamics we conventionally close the PDEs for density, momentum and energy; yet in high speed flow especially at lower densities we need to resolve modes of molecular vibration because they have not equilibrated on the time scales of the fluid flow.  Qualitatively the same considerations apply to the equation-free approach.

For many systems appropriate coarse variables are more-or-less known by experience.  However, in complex situations there is a need to automatically detect the appropriate coarse variables, and then use them in the macroscale evolution.  This needs much more research utilizing techniques from data mining and manifold learning.  In some problems it could be that as well as densities, the appropriate coarse variables also need to include spatial correlations, as in the so-called Brownian bugs.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Young, A. J. Roberts, and G. Stuhne. Reproductive pair correlations and the clustering of organisms. ''Nature'', 412:328–331, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The macroscale may have to be treated as a stochastic system, but then the errors are likely to be much larger and the closures more uncertain.

During the [[2018 World Cup]] in [[Russia]], anti-occupation stencil signed by Gagosh emerged in Tbilisi Old Town. The stencil presents the red [[FIFA]] cup placed upon red skulls with text in the bottom “Russia 2008”. On his official website, the author writes: “10 years before Russia2018, the world witnessed the Russia2008 away match in Georgia, played by artillery and troops with disregard for fair play. And still they have not been disqualified?!” &lt;ref&gt;[http://gagosh.org/russia2008/]. ''gagosh.org''.01 July 2018.

In August of 2018, for the 10 years of occupation Gagosh made another anti-occupational mural on the wall of [[National Parliamentary Library of Georgia]] named “Wall of August”. The mural is based on the [[Guernica]], prominent work of [[Picasso]] as it was created for the response to the bombing of [[Guernica]]  by [[Nazi]]’s. “The Wall of August” depicts several tragic themes that were shot during the war days of 2008. The mural conveys several metaphorical elements such as Russian military boots on the Georgian ornamented carpet, bear enters and leaves, the theme and bombs that repetitively contain the digits of 2,0,0,8. &lt;ref&gt;[http://gagosh.org/wall-of-august/].

[[File:Fourteen stages.JPG|thumb|Fourteen stages on the path to liberation]]
{{Jainism}}
'''{{IAST|Guṇasthāna}}''' ([[Sanskrit]]: "levels of virtue") are the fourteen stages of spiritual development and growth through which a soul gradually passes before it attains [[Moksha (Jainism)|''moksha'']] (liberation).&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jainism]], it is a state of soul from a complete dependence on ''[[Karma in Jainism|karma]]'' to the state of complete dissociation from it. Here the word ''virtue'' does not mean an ordinary moral quality, but it stands for the nature of soul — knowledge, belief and conduct.

== Overview ==
The fourteen ''Gunasthāna'' represents the soul's gradual manifestation of the innate qualities of knowledge, belief and conduct in a more and more perfect form.{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=95}}&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p. 186–219&lt;/ref&gt; Following are the stages of spiritual development:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r5opAwAAQBAJ|title=Acarya Pujyapada's Istopadesa – the Golden Discourse|isbn=9788190363969|author1=Jain|first1=Vijay K|date=2014-03-26|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p. 274–85&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fourteen stages==

;1. Mithyadristi
The first stage signifies gross ignorance.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=117}} If at this stage, a person meditates on his existence, there is a temporary suspension of the following:{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=41, 118}}
*The first three energies of ''darsanamohaniya karma'' (which obstructs right belief)
#''mithyātva''
#''samyaga mithyātva''
#''samyak prakriti''
* The ''anantdnubandhi'' (intensest) type of anger, pride, deceit and greed

;2. Sasādana

This ''gunasthāna'' represents the mental state of the soul in the process or act of falling from right faith. Here ''sā'' means "with" and sādana means "exhausted", hence that which is characterised by exhausted faith.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=118}}

;3. Misradrsti
''Misra'' literally means mixed. At this stage, a person hovers between certainty and doubt on Right belief.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=118}}

;4 Avirata samyagdrishti
When doubts of an individual are removed, he/she reaches this stage and becomes a ''samyagdrishti'' (true believer). The doubts may have been removed by meditation or the instruction of a spiritual teacher.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=119}}

;5. ''Deśavirata''
''Deśa'' means partial and ''virata'' means vow i.e. observance of the partial vows in pursuit of Right conduct.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=119}}

;6. Pramatta virata (slightly imperfect vows)
First step of life as a ''[[Jain muni]]'' (monk).{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=119}} The stage of complete self-discipline, although sometimes brought into wavering through negligence.

;7. Apramatta virata (perfect observance of vows)

;8. Apurva Karana
The stage of one in whom the passions are still occurring in a gross form.

;9. Annivrtti Karaņa (advanced thought activity)
The stage of one who practices the process called ''annivrtti karaņa''  and in whom however the passions are still occurring.

;10. Sukshma sāmprāya
The stage of one in whom the passions occur in a subtle form.

;11. Upaśānta-kasaya
The stage of one who has suppressed every passion but still does not possess omniscience.

;12. Kshina Moha (Destruction of delusion)
The stage of who has annihilated every passion but does not yet possess omniscience. According to the Jain text, ''[[Gommatsāra]] Jīvakanda'':{{quote|That possessionless saint (Nirgrantha), all of whose deluding, passions (Moha Kashaya) are destroyed, and whose thought is clear like the water kept in a pure vessel of crystal Jewel is said by the non-attached (Conquerors) (to be in the 12th stage of) destroyed-delusion, or delusionless (Kshina Kashaya).|Gommatsāra (62){{sfn|Jaini|1927|p=46}}}}

;13. Sayoga Kevali
''Sa'' means "with" and yoga refers to the three channels of activity, i.e., mind, speech and body.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=120}} ''Kevali'' is a term used to refer the omniscient beings (''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihantas]]''). This stage is characterised by the destruction of all inimical (''ghātiā'') ''karmas'' and attainment of omniscience.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=121}} 

;14. Ayoga Kevali
This is the last stage on the Path, and is followed by the soul's destruction of the ''aghātiā karmas''. Those who pass this stage are called ''siddha'' and become fully established in Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=121}}

==The destruction of causes of bondage==
The whole scheme of ''gunasthana'' in [[Jain philosophy]] is devised in a logical order according to the principle of decreasing sinfulness and increasing purity. At the first stage, all the five causes of bondage — Irrational beliefs (''[[mithyatva]]''), non-restraint (''avirati''), carelessness (''pramada''), passions (''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|kashaya]]'') and activities of mind, speech and body (''[[yoga]]'') — are in full operation.&lt;ref name="Kuhn, Hermann 2001 p. 87–88"&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; Irrational beliefs (''mithyatva'') are partially suppressed in the second and third stages, and are fully eliminated in the fourth stage. In stages five and six, non-restraint (''avirati'') is gradually eliminated in stages. From the seventh stage onwards, carelessness is removed and only passions and activity exercise their influence. From the eleventh to the thirteenth all the passions are eliminated and only activity is present. On the last stage, there is no activity, hence no binding of karma.&lt;ref name="Kuhn, Hermann 2001 p. 87–88"/&gt;

==The destruction of karmas==
Out of the four [[ghatiya karma]]s, darsana mohiniya karma (perception deluding karma) is destroyed first in the fourth stage of ''gunasthana''. Caritra mohiniya karma (conduct deluding karma) is destroyed next in the twelfth gunasthana. The remaining three ghatiya karmas (knowledge obstructing karma, perception obstructing karma and energy obstructing karma) are destroyed in the 13th stage and the rest four [[aghatiya karma]]s (life-span determining, body determining, status determining and feeling producing karmas) are destroyed in the 14th or the last stage of gunasthana.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Hansei'''''|反省||"self-reflection"}} is a central idea in [[Japan]]ese culture, meaning to acknowledge one's own mistake and to pledge improvement. This is similar to the German proverb ''Selbsterkenntnis ist der erste Schritt zur Besserung,'' where the closest translation to English would be "Self-awareness is the first step to improvement".

==Cultural meaning==
In the ''hansei'' process, the emphasis is on what went wrong and on creating clear plans for ensuring that it does not reoccur; this is done constantly and consistently. At [[Toyota]], even if you do a project successfully, there is still a ''hansei-kai'' (reflection meeting) to review what went wrong. If a manager or engineer claims that there were not any problems with the project, they will be reminded that “no problem is a problem” – in other words, you have not objectively and [[Critical thinking|critically]] evaluated the project to find opportunities for improvement. No problems indicate that you did not stretch to meet (or exceed) your expected capacity.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Cultural examples==
An example would be the actions of Japanese politicians involved in corruption. They apologize publicly for the inappropriate action, then remove themselves from public politics for a few years. They resume their career after a culturally accepted period of time where they learned their lesson.

In Japanese companies it is common practice for a manager to expect ''hansei'' from his subordinates in case of mistakes. The manager will publicly take the blame, while the department works on solving the problem.

==Other use==  
Hansei also incorporates the concept of greeting success with modesty and [[humility]]. To stop ''hansei,'' means to stop learning. With ''hansei,'' one never becomes convinced of one's own [[Superiority complex|superiority]], and feels that there is always more room, or need, for further improvement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10818">The '''Harrod–Domar model''' is a [[classical Keynesian]] model of [[economic growth]]. It is used in [[development economics]] to explain an economy's growth rate in terms of the level of saving and productivity of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. It suggests that there is no natural reason for an economy to have balanced growth. The model was developed independently by [[Roy Forbes Harrod|Roy F. Harrod]] in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2225181 | title=An Essay in Dynamic Theory | author=Harrod, Roy F. | journal=The Economic Journal | year=1939 | volume=49 | issue=193 | pages=14–33 | doi=10.2307/2225181}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Evsey Domar]] in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1905364 | title=Capital Expansion, Rate of Growth, and Employment | author=Domar, Evsey | journal=Econometrica | year=1946 | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=137–147 | doi=10.2307/1905364}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a similar model had been proposed by [[Gustav Cassel]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cassel |first=Gustav |url=https://mises.org/books/theorysocialeconomy_cassel.pdf |chapter=Capital and Income in the Money Economy |pages=51–63 |title=The Theory of Social Economy |location=New York |publisher=[[Augustus M. Kelley]] |year=1967 |origyear=1924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrod–Domar model was the precursor to the [[exogenous growth model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hagemann |first=Harald |year=2009 |title=Solow's 1956 Contribution in the Context of the Harrod-Domar Model |journal=History of Political Economy |volume=41 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=67–87 |doi=10.1215/00182702-2009-017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neoclassical economics|Neoclassical economists]] claimed shortcomings in the Harrod–Domar model—in particular the [[instability]] of its solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scarfe |first=Brian L. |chapter=The Harrod Model and the ‘Knife Edge’ Problem |pages=63–66 |title=Cycles, Growth, and Inflation: A Survey of Contemporary Macrodynamics |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1977 |isbn=0-07-055039-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—and, by the late 1950s, started an academic dialogue that led to the development of the [[Solow–Swan model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sato |first=Ryuzo |authorlink=Ryuzo Sato |title=The Harrod-Domar Model vs the Neo-Classical Growth Model |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=74 |issue=294 |year=1964 |pages=380–387 |jstor=2228485 |doi=10.2307/2228485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Solow |first=Robert M. |title=Perspectives on Growth Theory |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1994 |pages=45–54 |jstor=2138150 |doi=10.1257/jep.8.1.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Harrod–Domar model there are three kinds of growth: warranted growth, actual growth and natural rate of growth.

Warranted growth rate is the rate of growth at which the economy does not expand indefinitely or go into recession. Actual growth is the real rate increase in a country's GDP per year. (See also: [[Gross domestic product]] and [[Natural gross domestic product]]). Natural growth is the growth an economy requires to maintain full employment. For example, If the labor force grows at 3 percent per year, then to maintain full employment, the economy’s annual growth rate must be 3 percent.

==Mathematical formalism==
Let ''Y'' represent output, which equals income, and let ''K'' equal the capital stock.  ''S'' is total saving, ''s'' is the savings rate, and ''I'' is investment.  ''δ'' stands for the rate of depreciation of the capital stock. The Harrod–Domar model makes the following ''a priori'' assumptions:
{| border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="2"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\ Y=f(K)&lt;/math&gt;

| 1:  Output is a function of capital stock
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\ \frac{dY}{dK}=c \Rightarrow \frac{dY}{dK}=\frac{Y}{K}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2:  The marginal product of capital is constant; the production function exhibits constant returns to scale. This implies capital's marginal and average products are equal.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\ f(0)=0  &lt;/math&gt;
| 3:  Capital is necessary for output.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\ sY=S=I &lt;/math&gt;
| 4:  The product of the savings rate and output equals saving, which equals investment
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\ \Delta\ K=I- \delta\ K &lt;/math&gt;
| 5:  The change in the capital stock equals investment less the depreciation of the capital stock
|}

Derivation of output growth rate:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; c= \frac{dY}{dK}=\frac{Y(t+1) - Y(t)}{K(t) + sY(t) - \delta\ K(t) - K(t)} \\[8pt]
&amp; c= \frac{Y(t+1) - Y(t)}{sY(t) - \delta\ \frac{dK}{dY} Y(t)} \\[8pt]
&amp; c(sY(t) - \delta\ \frac{dK}{dY} Y(t))=Y(t+1) - Y(t) \\[8pt]
&amp; cY(t)\left(s - \delta\ \frac{dK}{dY}\right) = Y(t+1) - Y(t) \\[8pt]
&amp; cs - c \delta\ \frac{dK}{dY}=\frac{Y(t+1) - Y(t)}{Y(t)} \\[8pt]
&amp; s \frac{dY}{dK} - \delta\ \frac{dY}{dK} \frac{dK}{dY}=\frac{Y(t+1) - Y(t)}{Y(t)} \\[8pt]
&amp; s c - \delta\ = \frac{ \Delta Y}{Y}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

A derivation with calculus is as follows, using dot notation (for example, &lt;math&gt;\ \dot{Y} &lt;/math&gt;) for the derivative of a variable with respect to time.

First, assumptions (1)–(3) imply that output and capital are linearly related (for readers with an economics background, this proportionality implies a capital-[[Output elasticity|elasticity of output]] equal to unity). These assumptions thus generate equal growth rates between the two variables. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\ Y=cK \Rightarrow log(Y)=log(c)+log(K).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the marginal product of capital, ''c'', is a constant, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{d\log(Y)}{dt}=\frac{d\log(K)}{dt} \Rightarrow \frac{\dot{Y}}{Y}=\frac{\dot{K}}{K}. &lt;/math&gt;

Next, with assumptions (4) and (5), we can find capital's growth rate as,

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\dot{K}}{K}=\frac{I}{K}-\delta\ = s \frac{Y}{K}-\delta\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ \Rightarrow \frac{\dot{Y}}{Y} = s c - \delta\ &lt;/math&gt;

In summation, the savings rate times the marginal product of capital minus the depreciation rate equals the output growth rate. Increasing the savings rate, increasing the marginal product of capital, or decreasing the depreciation rate will increase the growth rate of output; these are the means to achieve growth in the Harrod–Domar model.

==Significance==

Although the Harrod–Domar model was initially created to help analyse the [[business cycle]], it was later adapted to explain economic growth. Its implications were that growth depends on the quantity of labour and capital; more investment leads to capital accumulation, which generates economic growth. The model carries implications for [[Less developed countries|less economically developed countries]], where labour is in plentiful supply in these countries but [[physical capital]] is not, slowing down economic progress. [[Less developed countries|LDC]]s do not have sufficiently high incomes to enable sufficient rates of saving; therefore, accumulation of physical-capital stock through investment is low.

The model implies that economic growth depends on policies to increase investment, by increasing saving, and using that investment more efficiently through technological advances.

The model concludes that an economy does not "naturally" find full employment and stable growth rates.

==Criticisms of the model==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|
{{original research|section|date=May 2014}}
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
}}
The main criticism of the model is the level of assumption, one being that there is no reason for growth to be sufficient to maintain full employment; this is based on the belief that the relative [[price]] of labour and capital is fixed, and that they are used in equal proportions. The model explains economic [[boom and bust]] by the assumption that [[investor]]s are only influenced by output (known as the [[accelerator principle]]); this is now  believed to be correct.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In terms of development, critics claim that the model sees economic growth and [[economic development|development]] as the same; in reality, economic growth is only a subset of development. Another criticism is that the model implies poor countries should borrow to finance investment in capital to trigger economic growth; however, history has shown that this often causes repayment problems later.

The endogeneity of savings:
Perhaps the most important parameter in the Harrod–Domar model is the rate of savings. Can it be treated as a parameter that can be manipulated easily by policy? That depends on how much control the policy maker has over the economy. In fact, there are several reasons  to believe that the rate of savings may itself be influenced by the overall level of per capita income in the society, not to mention the distribution of that income among the population.

'''Jakob Johann [[Baron]] von Uexküll''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʏkskʏl|lang}}; 8 September 1864 – 25 July 1944) was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] biologist who worked in the fields of muscular [[physiology]], animal behaviour studies, and the [[cybernetics]] of [[life]]. However, his most notable contribution is the notion of ''[[Umwelt]]'', used by [[Semiotics|semiotician]] [[Thomas Sebeok]] and philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]]. His works established [[biosemiotics]] &lt;ref&gt;Donald Favareau, ''Essential Readings in Biosemiotics'', Springer, 2010, 91-89.&lt;/ref&gt; as a field of research.

==Early life==
The son of [[Alexander Rudolf Karl von Uexküll|Alexander Baron von Uexküll]] and Sophie von Hahn, Jakob von Uexküll was born in the Keblas estate, [[Mihkli]], [[Governorate of Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://personen.digitale-sammlungen.de/baltlex/Blatt_bsb00000600,00507.html?prozent= Genealogisches ''Handbuch der baltischen Ritterschaften'', 1930, p. 490.]&lt;/ref&gt; His aristocratic family lost most of their fortune by expropriation during the Russian Revolution. Needing to support himself, Uexküll took a job as professor at the [[University of Hamburg]] where he founded the ''Institut für Umweltforschung''.&lt;ref name="Agamben 39"&gt;[[Giorgio Agamben]], ''The Open: Man and Animal'', trans. Kevin Attell, Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2004, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Umwelt==
{{main|Umwelt}}

Uexküll was particularly interested in how living beings [[Perception|perceive]] their [[Natural environment|environment]](s). He argued that organisms experience life in terms of species-specific, spatio-temporal, 'self-in-world' subjective reference frames that he called ''Umwelt'' (translated as ''surrounding-world'',&lt;ref&gt;Jakob von Uexküll, ''Theoretical Biology'', New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1926, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; ''phenomenal world''&lt;ref name=Uexküll1957&gt;Jakob von Uexküll, ''A Stroll Through the Worlds of Animals and Men: A Picture Book of Invisible Worlds''. In ''Instinctive Behavior: The Development of a Modern Concept'', edited and translated by Claire H. Schiller, New York: International Universities Press, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''self-world''&lt;ref name=Uexküll1957/&gt;, ''environment''&lt;ref&gt;Jakob von Uexküll, ''A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans: With A Theory of Meaning'', translated by Joseph D. O'Neil, Minneapolis/London: University of Minnesota Press, 2010, pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  - lit. German ''environment''). These ''Umwelten'' (plural of ''Umwelt'') are distinctive from what Uexküll termed the "[[Umgebung]]" which would be the living being's surroundings as seen from the likewise peculiar perspective or ''Umwelt'' of the human observer. ''Umwelt'' may thus be defined as the perceptual world in which an organism exists and acts as a subject. By studying how the senses of various organisms like  [[tick]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[amoebae]], [[jellyfish]] and [[sea worms]] work, he was able to build theories of how they experience the world. Because all organisms perceive and react to sensory data as signs, Uexküll argued that they were to be considered as living subjects. This argument was the basis for his biological theory in which the characteristics of biological existence ("life") could not simply be described as a sum of its non-organic parts, but had to be described as subject and a part of a sign system.

The [[biosemiotic]] turn in Jakob von Uexküll's analysis occurs in his discussion of the animal's relationship with its environment. The ''Umwelt'' is for him an environment-world which is (according to [[Giorgio Agamben]]), "constituted by a more or less broad series of elements [called] "carriers of significance" or "marks" which are the only things that interest the animal". Agamben goes on to paraphrase one example from Uexküll's discussion of a tick, saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...this eyeless animal finds the way to her watchpoint [at the top of a tall blade of grass] with the help of only its skin’s general sensitivity to light. The approach of her prey becomes apparent to this blind and deaf bandit only through her sense of smell. The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, works on the tick as a signal that causes her to abandon her post (on top of the blade of grass/bush) and fall blindly downward toward her prey. If she is fortunate enough to fall on something warm (which she perceives by means of an organ sensible to a precise temperature) then she has attained her prey, the warm-blooded animal, and thereafter needs only the help of her sense of touch to find the least hairy spot possible and embed herself up to her head in the cutaneous tissue of her prey. She can now slowly suck up a stream of warm blood."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, for the tick, the ''Umwelt'' is reduced to only three (biosemiotic) carriers of significance: (1) The [[odor]] of [[butyric acid]], which emanates from the [[sebaceous]] follicles of all [[mammals]], (2) The [[temperature]] of 37 degrees Celsius (corresponding to the [[blood]] of all mammals), (3) The hairiness of mammals.

==Theoretical biology==
{{Semiotics}}
von Uexküll anticipated many computer science ideas, particularly in the field of robotics, roughly 25 years before these things were invented.&lt;ref&gt;Lagerspetz, Kari Y. (2001): Jakob von Uexküll and the origins of cybernetics. ''Semiotica'' 134 (1/4): 643–651.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uexküll views organisms in terms of information processing. He argues every organism has an outer boundary which defines an '''Umwelt''' (German word generally meaning 'environment', 'surrounding world'). Rather than the general meaning, Uexküll's concept draws on the literal meaning of the German word, which is 'surround-world', to define the '''Umwelt''' as the subjectively perceived surroundings about which information is available to an organism through its senses.&lt;ref&gt;Chien, 2007, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a subjective ''weltanschauung'', or "world view", and is therefore fundamentally different from the [[black box]] concept, which is derived from the objective Newtonian viewpoint.

The organism has sensors that report the state of the ''Umwelt'' and effectors that can change parts of the ''Umwelt''. He distinguished the effector as the logical opposite of the sensor, or sense organ. Sensors and effectors are linked in a [[Feedback|feedback loop]]. Sensor input is processed by a ''Merkorgan'' and effectors are controlled by a ''Werkorgan''. The modern term 'sensorimotor' used in [[Enactivism|enactive theories of cognition]] encompasses these concepts.

He further distinguishes the ''Umgebung'' (that part of the ''Umwelt'' that represents distal features of the external world, in German 'that which is being given as surroundings') from the Innenwelt which is reported directly by sensors and is therefore the only unmediated reality immediately knowable to the organism. The relationship between the distal (mediated, transformed) features of the Umbegung and the proximal (untransformed, unmediated, primal) features of the Innenwelt must be learned by the organism in infancy. The nature of the Umbegung::Innenwelt relationship is relevant to the later theories of [[Embodied cognition]].

This is also similar to Kant's [[phenomenon]] and [[noumenon]] but derived logically from the properties of the sensors. What we now call a "feedback loop" he calls a "function-circle" and "circle" seems to be something like "system". He uses the term "melody" to mean something close to "algorithm". He coins around 75 technical terms, and a proper understanding of his book would require clearly defining them in modern terms and understanding their relations. He notices [[qualia]], comes close to object-oriented programming (page 98) uses the image of a helmsman which later showed up as "cybernetics" (page 291) and makes a good guess about DNA (page 127). He has a large number of ideas, although not expressed clearly in modern terms. His metaphysics is hyper-Kantian ("All reality is subjective appearance", page xv.) Space is a set of direction symbols. He rejects Darwin and says nothing of God. Organisms are based on something called "Plan", the origin of which we cannot know.

Uexküll was an advocate of [[non-Darwinian evolution]] and critic of Darwinism.&lt;ref&gt;Kreitler, Shulamith. (2013). ''Cognition and Motivation: Forging an Interdisciplinary Perspective''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 185-186. {{ISBN|978-0-521-88867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kalevi Kull]] noted that "despite his opposition to Darwinism, Uexküll was not anti-evolutionist".&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Brett. (2008). ''Onto-ethologies : The Animal Environments of Uexküll, Heidegger, Merleau-ponty, and Deleuze''. SUNY Press. p. 18. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7611-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Works by scholars such as [[Kalevi Kull]] connect Uexküll's studies with some areas of [[philosophy]] such as [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]]. Jakob von Uexküll is also considered a pioneer of [[Semiotics|semiotic]] biology, or [[biosemiotics]]. However, despite his influence (on the work of philosophers [[Max Scheler]],   [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Humberto Maturana]], [[Georges Canguilhem]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] (in their ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''), for example) he is still not widely known, and his books are mostly out of print in German and in English. A paperback French translation of ''Streifzüge durch die Umwelten von Tieren und Menschen'' [A stroll through the Umwelten of animals and humans] of 1934 is currently in print.  This book has been translated in English as ''A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans, with A Theory of Meaning'' by Jakob von Uexküll, translated by Joseph D. O'Neil, introduction by Dorion Sagan, University of Minnesota Press, 2011. The other available book is "Theoretical Biology", a reprint of the 1926 translation of "Theoretische Biologie" (1920). "Foray" is a popular introduction while "Theoretical Biology" is intended for an academic audience.

== Family ==
His sons were the physician [[Thure von Uexküll]] and journalist Gösta von Uexküll. His daughter was Sophie Luise Damajanti von Uexküll ('Dana'). His grandson is the writer [[Jakob von Uexkull]].

==In popular culture==
Uexküll's ideas about how organisms create their own concept of time are described in [[Peter Høeg|Peter Høeg's]] novel ''[[Borderliners]]'', and contrasted with [[Isaac Newton|Isaac Newton's]] view of time as something that exists independent of life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Høeg, ''Borderliners'', trans. Barbara Haveland (The Harvill Press, 1995), pp. 214–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tioman Rainforest.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Jungle on [[Tioman Island]], [[Malaysia]]]]
A '''jungle''' is land covered with dense vegetation dominated by trees. Application of the term has varied greatly over recent centuries and it has little scientific meaning.  Before the 1970s, various [[tropical forests]] were referred to as jungles but this terminology has fallen out of usage. Jungles in [[Western culture|Western]] literature can represent a less civilised or unruly space outside the control of civilisation, attributed to the jungle's association in [[colonial discourse]] with places colonised by Europeans.

==Etymology==
The word ''jungle'' originates from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Jangla'' ({{Lang-sa| जङ्गल}}), meaning uncultivated land. Although the Sanskrit word refers to dry land, it has been suggested that an Anglo-Indian interpretation led to its connotation as a dense "tangled thicket"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The jungle and the aroma of meats: an ecological theme in Hindu medicine. Volume 4 |author=Francis Zimmermann| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=1999| isbn= 81-208-1618-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have argued that a cognate word in [[Urdu]] did refer to forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Dialectical History of 'Jungle' in Pakistan: An Examination of the Relationship between Nature and Culture| author=Dove, Michael R. |journal=Journal of Anthropological Research |volume=48| issue= 3 |year=1992 |pages=231–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is prevalent in many languages of the [[Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Iranian Plateau]], where it is commonly used to refer to the plant growth replacing [[primeval forest]] or to the unkempt [[tropical vegetation]] that takes over abandoned areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Sir Henry Yule|Yule, Henry, Sir]]|title= Hobson-Jobson: A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical and discursive.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==
Because jungles occur on all inhabited landmasses and may incorporate numerous vegetation and land types in different climatic zones, the wildlife of jungles can not be straightforwardly defined.

==Varying usage==

===As dense and impenetrable vegetation===
[[File:Dry rainforest.jpg|thumb|left|Vine thicket, a typical impenetrable jungle, Australia]]
One of the most common meanings of ''jungle'' is land overgrown with tangled vegetation at ground level, especially in the [[tropics]]. Typically such vegetation is sufficiently dense to hinder movement by humans, requiring that travellers cut their way through.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/biomes/biomes_tropical_forests_page_1.html Tropical Forests&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010223155/http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/biomes/biomes_tropical_forests_page_1.html |date=2012-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/26634/forest/introf.htm Mysterious Journey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702005610/http://library.thinkquest.org/26634/forest/introf.htm |date=2012-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Nygren, A. 2006 Representations of Tropical Forests and Tropical Forest-Dwellers in Travel Accounts of ‘National Geographic', Environmental Values 15&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition draws a distinction between [[rainforest]] and jungle, since the understorey of rainforests is typically open of vegetation due to a lack of sunlight, and hence relatively easy to traverse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneonta.edu/faculty/baumanpr/geosat2/Central%20Africa%20I/Central%20Africa%20Part%20I.htm|title=Tropical Wet Realms Of Central Africa, Part I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/rainforest.htm|title=Rainforest Biomes|website=www.blueplanetbiomes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jungles may exist within, or at the borders of, rainforests in areas where rainforest has been opened through natural disturbance such as hurricanes, or through human activity such as logging.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kricher JC. 1997.

Jungle also typically forms along rainforest margins such as stream banks, once again due to the greater available light at ground level.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

[[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|Monsoon forests]] and [[mangrove]]s are commonly referred to as jungles of this type.

===As moist forest===
[[File:Fluss Dja Somalomo.JPG|thumb|Impenetrable jungle lining a river bank in rainforest, Cameroon]]

Because European explorers initially travelled through tropical rainforests largely by river, the dense tangled vegetation lining the stream banks gave a misleading impression that such jungle conditions existed throughout the entire forest. As a result, it was wrongly assumed that the entire forest was impenetrable jungle.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, T. (1983). ''The Amazon: The World's Wild Places''. Time-Life Books. New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oneonta.edu/faculty/baumanpr/geosat2/Central%20Africa%20I/Central%20Africa%20Part%20I.htm | title=Tropical Wet Realms of Central Africa, Part 1 | publisher=Oneonta.edu (State University of New York College at Oneonta) |year=2009 | accessdate=November 29, 2012 | author=Baumann, Paul R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This in turn appears to have given rise to the second popular usage of jungle as virtually any humid [[tropical forest]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Purser, B. 2003.

G. 1997: "First contact: colonial European preconceptions of tropical Queensland rainforest and its people". ''Journal of Historical Geography'' 23, 393–417.&lt;/ref&gt; but may extend to [[cloud forest]], temperate rainforest, and mangroves&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M\Iyengar, M. O. T.  1930 Jungle in Relation to Malaria in Bengal. Indian Journal of Medical Research 18:1&lt;/ref&gt; with no reference to the vegetation structure or the ease of travel.

The generic term "[[tropical forest]]" and "rainforest" have largely replaced "jungle" as the descriptor of humid tropical forests, a linguistic transition that has occurred since the 1970s. "Rainforest" itself did not appear in English dictionaries prior to the 1970s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Rogers, C. 2012 ''Jungle Fever: Exploring Madness and Medicine in Twentieth-Century Tropical Narratives''. Vanderbilt University Press, Nashville. {{ISBN|9780826518316}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "jungle" accounted for over 80% of the terms used to refer to tropical forests in print media prior to the 1970s; since then it has been steadily replaced by "rainforest",&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Slater, C (2003). In Search of the Rain Forest. Duke University Press&lt;/ref&gt; although "jungle" still remains in common use when referring to tropical rainforests.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== As metaphor ===
[[File:Jungle comics 128.jpg|thumb|upright|Use of the jungle to represent savageness and ferocity in popular culture.]]

As a metaphor, ''jungle'' often refers to situations that are unruly or lawless, or where the only law is perceived to be "survival of the fittest". This reflects the view of "city people" that forests are such places. [[Upton Sinclair]] gave the title ''[[The Jungle]]'' (1906) to his famous book about the life of workers at the Chicago Stockyards, portraying the workers as being mercilessly exploited with no legal or other lawful recourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dark Eden: the swamp in nineteenth-century American culture |series=Volume 43 of Cambridge studies in American literature and culture Structural Analysis in the Social Sciences|author=Miller, David Cameron |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=1989| isbn=0-521-37553-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[The Law of the Jungle]]" is also used in a similar context, drawn from [[Rudyard Kipling|Rudyard Kipling's]] ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' (1894)—though in the society of jungle animals portrayed in that book and obviously meant as a metaphor for human society, that phrase referred to an intricate code of laws which Kipling describes in detail, and not at all to a lawless chaos.

The word "jungle" itself carries connotations of untamed and uncontrollable nature and isolation from civilisation, along with the emotions that evokes: threat, confusion, powerlessness, disorientation and immobilisation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fearing, F. (1963) "The problem of metaphor" Southern Journal of Communication&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J. (1962)  "The Thin Red Line". Dell Publishing New York&lt;/ref&gt;  The change from "jungle" to "rainforest" as the preferred term for describing tropical forests as has been a response to an increasing perception of these forests as fragile and spiritual places, a viewpoint not in keeping with the darker connotations of "jungle".&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, C (2004). Marketing the ‘rain forest’: Raw Vanilla fragrance and the ongoing transformation of the jungle. Cultural Geographies 11:4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustavson, E. 2007 "Rhetoric: How Politicians Manipulate Language and the Media to Shape Public Thought" Hinckley Journal of Politics 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural studies|Cultural scholars]], especially [[post-colonial]] critics, often analyse the jungle within the concept of hierarchical domination and the demand western cultures often places on other cultures to conform to their standards of civilisation. For example: [[Edward Said]] notes that the [[Tarzan]] depicted by [[Johnny Weissmuller]] was a resident of the jungle representing the savage, untamed and wild, yet still a white master of it;&lt;ref name = Said&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Jungle Calling| title = Reflections on Exile: And Other Essays| series = Convergences Series| first = Edward W. | last = Said| publisher =  Harvard University Press| year = 2000| isbn = 9780674003026}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his essay "[[An Image of Africa]]" about ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' Nigerian novelist and theorist [[Chinua Achebe]] notes how the jungle and [[Africa]] become the source of temptation for white European characters like Marlowe and Kurtz.&lt;ref name =Achebe&gt;{{cite journal| first = Achebe| last = Chinua| title = An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' | journal = Massachusetts Review| edition = 18| year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Ehud Barak]] compared Israel to "a villa in the jungle" - a comparison which had been often quoted in Israeli political debates. Barak's critics on the left side of Israeli politics strongly criticised the comparison. For example, [[Uri Avnery]] charged that comparing "civilised" Israel with "a villa" and Israel's Arab neighbors with the "wild beasts" of the "jungle" tends to throw the blame for the absence of peace on the "wild" Arab and Palestinian side, and absolve Israel of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Uri Avnery, "Barak: A Villa in the Jungle", Gush Shalom website, July 7, 2007 [http://zope.gush-shalom.org/home/en/channels/avnery/archives_barak/],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akiva Eldar, "The price of a villa in the jungle", [[Ha'aretz]], Jan. 30, 2006 [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/the-price-of-a-villa-in-the-jungle-1.178800 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larry Derfner, "Ehud Barak to step down: On his de-evolution, and Israel's", +972 Magazine, November 26, 2012 [http://972mag.com/ehud-baraks-de-evolution-and-israels/60889/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang|fr|Jurisprudence constante}}''''' ([[French language|French]] for "stable jurisprudence", or literally, "constant jurisprudence") is a [[legal doctrine]] according to which a long series of previous decisions applying a particular legal principle or [[rule of law|rule]] is highly [[Precedent#Persuasive precedent|persuasive]] but not controlling in subsequent [[legal case|cases]] dealing with similar or identical issues of law&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in the case of French administrative law, see CE, July 13th 2016, ''[http://www.conseil-etat.fr/Decisions-Avis-Publications/Decisions/Selection-des-decisions-faisant-l-objet-d-une-communication-particuliere/CE-13-juillet-2016-departement-de-la-Seine-Saint-Denis Département de la Seine-Saint-Denis]'',
N° 388317, §5 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;.  This doctrine is recognized in most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s as well as in certain mixed jurisdictions, e.g., [[law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].

The rule of law applied in the ''{{lang|fr|jurisprudence constante}}'' directly compares with ''{{lang|la|[[stare decisis]]}}''. But the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] notes the principal difference between the two legal doctrines: a single [[legal opinion|court decision]] can provide sufficient foundation for ''{{lang|la|stare decisis}}'', however, "a
series of [[case law|adjudicated cases]], all in accord, form the basis for ''{{lang|fr|jurisprudence constante}}''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants = Willis-Knighton Med. Ctr. v.

{{Software development process}}

'''Lean software development''' is a translation of [[lean manufacturing]] principles and practices to the [[software development]] domain.  Adapted from the [[Toyota Production System]],&lt;ref&gt;Yasuhiro Monden (1998), ''Toyota Production System, An Integrated Approach to Just-In-Time'', Third edition, Norcross, GA: Engineering &amp; Management Press, {{ISBN|0-412-83930-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is emerging with the support of a pro-lean subculture within the [[Agile software development|Agile]] community. Lean offers a solid conceptual framework, values and principles, as well as good practices, derived from experience, that support agile organizations.

== Origin ==

The term '''lean software development''' originated in a book by the same name, written by Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck.&lt;ref name="1Poppendieck2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Poppendieck|author2=Tom Poppendieck|title=Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQk4S7asBi4C&amp;pg=PA182|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-15078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book restates traditional [[Lean manufacturing#Overview|lean principles]], as well as a set of 22 ''tools'' and compares the tools to corresponding agile practices.  The Poppendiecks' involvement in the [[Agile software development]] community, including talks at several Agile conferences &lt;ref&gt;Mary Poppendieck: "The role of leadership in software development"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypEMdjslEOI&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in such concepts being more widely accepted within the Agile community.

== Lean principles ==

Lean development can be summarized by seven principles, very close in concept to lean manufacturing principles:&lt;ref name="2Poppendieck2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Poppendieck|author2=Tom Poppendieck|title=Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQk4S7asBi4C&amp;pg=PA182|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-15078-3|pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eliminate waste ===
Lean philosophy regards everything not adding value to the customer as waste ([[muda (Japanese term)|''muda'']]).  Such waste may include:&lt;ref name="3Poppendieck2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Poppendieck|author2=Tom Poppendieck|title=Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQk4S7asBi4C&amp;pg=PA182|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-15078-3|pages=19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Partially done work
# [[Hierarchical organization|Extra processes]]
# [[Software bloat|Extra features]]
# [[Task switching (psychology)|Task switching]]
# Waiting
# Motion
# [[Software bug|Defects]]
# [[Management|Management activities]]

Industry research revealed these software development wastes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sedano|first1=Todd|last2=Ralph|first2=Paul|last3=Péraire|first3=Cécile|title=Software Development Waste|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313360479_Software_Development_Waste|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Building the wrong feature or product
# Mismanaging the backlog
# Rework
# Unnecessarily complex solutions
# Extraneous cognitive load
# Psychological distress
# Waiting/multitasking
# Knowledge loss
# Ineffective communication.
 
In order to eliminate waste, one should be able to recognize it. If some activity could be bypassed or the result could be achieved without it, it is waste. Partially done coding eventually abandoned during the [[software development process|development process]] is waste. Extra processes like paperwork and features not often used by customers are waste. Switching people between tasks is waste. Waiting for other activities, teams, processes is waste. Motion required to complete work is waste. Defects and lower quality are waste. Managerial overhead not producing real value is waste.

A [[value stream mapping]] technique is used to identify waste. The second step is to point out sources of waste and to eliminate them.  Waste-removal should take place iteratively until even seemingly essential processes and procedures are liquidated.

=== Amplify learning ===
Software development is a continuous learning process based on iterations when writing code. Software design is a problem solving process involving the developers writing the code and what they have learned. Software value is measured in fitness for use and not in conformance to requirements.

Instead of adding more documentation or detailed planning, different ideas could be tried by writing code and building. The process of user requirements gathering could be simplified by presenting screens to the end-users and getting their input. The accumulation of defects should be prevented by running tests as soon as the code is written.

The learning process is sped up by usage of short iteration cycles – each one coupled with refactoring and [[integration testing]]. Increasing feedback via short feedback sessions with customers helps when determining the current phase of development and adjusting efforts for future improvements. During those short sessions both [[customer representative]]s and the development team learn more about the domain problem and figure out possible solutions for further development. Thus the customers better understand their needs, based on the existing result of development efforts, and the developers learn how to better satisfy those needs.  Another idea in the communication and learning process with a customer is set-based development – this concentrates on communicating the constraints of the future solution and not the possible solutions, thus promoting the birth of the solution via dialogue with the customer.{{Jargon-statement|date=June 2018}}

=== Decide as late as possible ===
As [[software development]] is always associated with some uncertainty, better results should be achieved with a ''set-based'' or ''options-based'' approach, delaying decisions as much as possible until they can be made based on facts and not on uncertain assumptions and predictions. The more complex a system is, the more capacity for change should be built into it, thus enabling the delay of important and crucial commitments. The iterative approach promotes this principle – the ability to adapt to changes and correct mistakes, which might be very costly if discovered after the release of the system.

:With set-based development: If a new brake system is needed for a car, for example, three teams may design solutions to the same problem. Each team learns about the problem space and designs a potential solution. As a solution is deemed unreasonable, it is cut. At the end of a period, the surviving designs are compared and one is chosen, perhaps with some modifications based on learning from the others - a great example of deferring commitment until the last possible moment. Software decisions could also benefit from this practice to minimize the risk brought on by big up-front design. Additionally, there would then be multiple implementations that work correctly, yet are different (implementation-wise, internally). These could be used to implement fault-tolerant systems which check all inputs and outputs for correctness, across the multiple implementations, simultaneously.

An [[agile software development]] approach can move the building of options earlier for customers, thus delaying certain crucial decisions until customers have realized their needs better. This also allows later adaptation to changes and the prevention of costly earlier technology-bounded decisions. This does not mean that no planning should be involved – on the contrary, planning activities should be concentrated on the different options and adapting to the current situation, as well as clarifying confusing situations by establishing patterns for rapid action. Evaluating different options is effective as soon as it is realized that they are not free, but provide the needed flexibility for late decision making.

=== Deliver as fast as possible ===
In the era of rapid technology evolution, it is not the biggest that survives, but the fastest. The sooner the end product is delivered without major defects, the sooner feedback can be received, and incorporated into the next [[iteration]]. The shorter the iterations, the better the learning and communication within the team. With speed, decisions can be delayed. Speed assures the fulfilling of the customer's present needs and not what they required yesterday.  This gives them the opportunity to delay making up their minds about what they really require until they gain better knowledge. Customers value rapid delivery of a [[Quality (business)|quality]] product.

The [[Just in time (business)|just-in-time]] production ideology could be applied to [[software development]], recognizing its specific requirements and environment. This is achieved by presenting the needed result and letting the team organize itself and divide the tasks for accomplishing the needed result for a specific [[Iteration#Project management|iteration]]. At the beginning, the customer provides the needed input.  This could be simply presented in small cards or [[User story|stories]] – the developers estimate the time needed for the [[implementation]] of each card. Thus the work organization changes into [[Kanban cards|self-pulling system]] – each morning during a [[stand-up meeting]], each member of the team reviews what has been done yesterday, what is to be done today and tomorrow, and prompts for any inputs needed from colleagues or the customer. This requires transparency of the process, which is also beneficial for team communication.

=== Empower the team ===
There has been a traditional belief in most businesses about the [[decision-making]] in the organization – the managers tell the workers how to do their own job. In a "Work-Out technique", the roles are turned – the managers are taught how to listen to the [[Software developer|developers]], so they can explain better what actions might be taken, as well as provide suggestions for improvements.  The lean approach follows the Agile Principle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/|title=12 Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto - Agile Alliance|author=|date=4 November 2015|website=agilealliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; "find good people and let them do their own job,"&lt;ref name="LinesAmbler2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Lines|author2=Scott W. Ambler|title=Disciplined Agile Delivery: A Practitioner's Guide to Agile Software Delivery in the Enterprise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SLIkMhB2ew0C&amp;pg=PA54|year=2012|publisher=IBM Press|isbn=978-0-13-281013-5|pages=54–}}&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging progress, catching errors, and removing impediments, but not micro-managing.

Another mistaken belief has been the consideration of people as [[resources]]. People might be [[resources]] from the point of view of a statistical data sheet, but in [[software development]], as well as any organizational business, people do need something more than just the list of tasks and the assurance that they will not be disturbed during the completion of the tasks. People need motivation and a higher purpose to work for – purpose within the reachable reality, with the assurance that the team might choose its own commitments. The developers should be given access to the customer; the [[team leader]] should provide support and help in difficult situations, as well as ensure that scepticism does not ruin the team’s spirit.

=== Build integrity in ===
The customer needs to have an overall experience of the System. This is the so-called perceived integrity: how it is being advertised, delivered, deployed, accessed, how intuitive its use is, its price and how well it solves problems.

Conceptual integrity means that the system’s separate components work well together as a whole with balance between flexibility, maintainability, efficiency, and responsiveness. This could be achieved by understanding the problem domain and solving it at the same time, not sequentially. The needed information is received in small batch pieces – not in one vast chunk -  preferably by face-to-face communication and not any written documentation. The information flow should be constant in both directions – from customer to developers and back, thus avoiding the large stressful amount of information after long development in isolation.

One of the healthy ways towards integral architecture is [[refactoring]].  As more features are added to the original code base, the harder it becomes to add further improvements. Refactoring is about keeping simplicity, clarity, minimum number of features in the code. Repetitions in the code are signs of bad code designs and should be avoided. The complete and automated building process should be accompanied by a complete and automated suite of developer and customer tests, having the same versioning, synchronization and semantics as the current state of the System. At the end the integrity should be verified with thorough testing, thus ensuring the System does what the customer expects it to. Automated tests are also considered part of the production process, and therefore if they do not add value they should be considered waste.  Automated testing should not be a goal, but rather a means to an end, specifically the reduction of defects.

=== See the whole ===
Software systems nowadays are not simply the sum of their parts, but also the product of their interactions. Defects in software tend to accumulate during the development process – by decomposing the big tasks into smaller tasks, and by standardizing different stages of development, the root causes of defects should be found and eliminated. The larger the system, the more organizations that are involved in its development and the more parts are developed by different teams, the greater the importance of having well defined relationships between different vendors, in order to produce a system with smoothly interacting components. During a longer period of development, a stronger subcontractor network is far more beneficial than short-term profit optimizing, which does not enable win-win relationships.

Lean thinking has to be understood well by all members of a project, before implementing in a concrete, real-life situation. "Think big, act small, fail fast; learn rapidly"&lt;ref name="PoppendieckPoppendieck2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Poppendieck|author2=Tom Poppendieck|title=Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQk4S7asBi4C&amp;pg=PA182|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-15078-3|pages=182–}}&lt;/ref&gt; – these slogans summarize the importance of understanding the field and the suitability of implementing lean principles along the whole software development process. Only when all of the lean principles are implemented together, combined with strong "common sense" with respect to the working environment, is there a basis for success in [[software development]].

== Lean software practices ==

Lean software development practices, or what the Poppendiecks call "tools" are restated slightly from the original equivalents in [[Agile software development]].   Examples of such practices include:

* Seeing [[muda (Japanese term)|waste]]
* [[Value stream mapping]]
* [[Theory of constraints|Set-based development]]
* [[Kanban cards|Pull systems]]
* [[Queuing theory]]
* [[Motivation]]
* [[Measurements]]
* [[Test-driven development]]
* [[Trunk-based development]]

Since Agile Software Development is an umbrella term for a set of methods and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Agile Manifesto, Lean Software Development is considered an Agile Software Development Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/|title=What is Agile Software Development?|author=|date=29 June 2015|website=agilealliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lobbying''', '''persuasion''', or '''interest representation''' is the act of attempting to influence the actions, policies, or decisions of officials in their daily life, most often [[legislator]]s or members of [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]]. Lobbying is done by many types of people, associations and organized groups, including individuals in the [[private sector]], [[corporation]]s, fellow legislators or government officials, or [[advocacy group]]s (interest groups). Lobbyists may be among a legislator's constituencies, meaning a voter or bloc of voters within their [[electoral district]]; they may engage in lobbying as a business. Professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation, regulation, or other government decisions, actions, or policies on behalf of a group or individual who hires them. Individuals and [[nonprofit organization]]s can also lobby as an act of volunteering or as a small part of their normal job. Governments often define and regulate organized group lobbying that has become influential.

The ethics and morals involved with lobbying are complicated. Lobbying can, at times, be spoken of with [[contempt]], when the implication is that people with inordinate socioeconomic power are corrupting the [[law]] in order to serve their own interests. When people who have a duty to act on behalf of others, such as elected officials with a duty to serve their constituents' interests or more broadly the public good, can benefit by shaping the law to serve the interests of some private parties, a [[conflict of interest]] exists.  Many critiques of lobbying point to the potential for conflicts of interest to lead to agent misdirection or the intentional failure of an agent with a duty to serve an employer, client, or constituent to perform those duties.  The failure of government officials to serve the public interest as a consequence of lobbying by special interests who provide benefits to the official is an example of agent misdirection.&lt;ref&gt;Arab Lobby in the United States Handbook, 2015 edition, published by the Global Investment Center, USA ({{ISBN|1-4387-0226-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In a report carried by the [[BBC]], an [[OED]] [[lexicographer]] has shown that "lobbying" finds its roots in the gathering of [[Members of parliament#United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] and [[peerage|peers]] in the hallways ("lobbies") of the [[UK]] [[Houses of Parliament]] before and after parliamentary debates where members of the public can meet their representatives.&lt;ref name=BBC-Lobby&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82529.stm |title=BBC Definition of lobbying |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One story held that the term originated at the [[Willard InterContinental Washington|Willard Hotel]] in Washington, DC, where it was supposedly used by [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Ulysses S. Grant]] to describe the political advocates who frequented the hotel's lobby to access Grant—who was often there in the evenings to enjoy a cigar and brandy—and would then try to buy the president drinks in an attempt to influence his political decisions.&lt;ref name="NPR - A Lobbyist by Any Other Name"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5167187 NPR - A Lobbyist by Any Other Name?] - NPR discussion of Ulysses Grant and origins of the term lobbyist.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term may have gained more widespread currency in Washington, D.C. by virtue of this practice during the [[Grant Administration]], the [[OED English|OED]] cites numerous documented uses of the word well before Grant's presidency, including use in Pennsylvania as early as 1808.&lt;ref name="NPR - A Lobbyist by Any Other Name"/&gt;

The term "lobbying" also appeared in print as early as 1820:&lt;ref&gt;Deanna Gelak (previous president of the American League of Lobbyists) mentioned this in her book ''Lobbying and Advocacy: Winning Strategies, Resources, Recommendations, Ethics and Ongoing Compliance for Lobbyists and Washington Advocates'', TheCapitol.Net, 2008, LobbyingAndAdvocacy.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Other letters from Washington affirm, that members of the Senate, when the compromise question was to be taken in the House, were not only "lobbying about the Representatives' Chamber" but also active in endeavoring to intimidate certain weak representatives by insulting threats to dissolve the Union.

[[Lobby groups]] may concentrate their efforts on the legislatures, where laws are created, but may also use the judicial branch to advance their causes. The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], for example, filed suits in state and federal courts in the 1950s to challenge segregation laws. Their efforts resulted in the Supreme Court declaring such laws unconstitutional.

Lobbyists may use a legal device known as ''[[amicus curiae]]'' (literally: "friend of the court") briefs to try to influence court cases. Briefs are written documents filed with a court, typically by parties to a lawsuit. ''Amici curiae'' briefs are briefs filed by people or groups who are not parties to a suit. These briefs are entered into the court records, and give additional background on the matter being decided upon. Advocacy groups use these briefs both to share their expertise and to promote their positions.

The [[lobbying industry]] is affected by the [[Revolving door (politics) |revolving door]] concept, a movement of personnel between roles as legislators and regulators and roles in the [[industry (disambiguation) | industries]] affected by legislation and regulation, as the main asset for a lobbyist is contacts with and influence on government officials.{{cn|date=November 2018}} This climate is attractive for ex-government officials.{{cn|date=November 2018}} It can also mean substantial monetary rewards for lobbying [[firm]]s, and government projects and contracts worth in the hundreds of millions for those they represent.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Timothy J.

==Lobbying by country==

===Australia===
Over the past twenty years, lobbying in [[Australia]] has grown from a small industry of a few hundred employees to a multi-billion dollar per year industry. What was once the preserve of big multinational companies and at a more local level, property developers, for example [[Urban Taskforce Australia]], has morphed into an industry that would employ more than [[10,000]] people and represent every facet of human endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first=Julian|title=Lobbying In Australia: You Can’t Expect Anything to Change If You Don’t Speak Up|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Topics european lobbying.jpg|thumb|[[Wikimania 2009]], results of the discussion about possible contents of European lobbying]]

The first step to towards specialized regulation of lobbying in the European Union was a Written Question tabled by Alman Metten, in 1989. In 1991, Marc Galle, Chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, was appointed to submit proposals for a Code of conduct and a register of lobbyists. Today lobbying in the European Union is an integral and important part of decision-making in the EU. From year to year lobbying regulation in the EU is constantly improving and the number of lobbyists are increases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nesterovych|first=Volodymyr|date=2015|title=EU standards for the regulation of lobbying|url=https://www.academia.edu/37339449/EU_standards_for_the_regulation_of_lobbying|journal=Prawa Człowieka|volume=nr 18|pages=98, 106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to Austrian [[Member of the European Parliament]] ("MEP") [[Hans-Peter Martin]], the value of lobby invitations and offers each individual MEP receives can reach up to €10,000 per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[New Europe (newspaper)|New European]] |date=April 25, 2011 |url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/taming-brussels-lobby |title=Taming Brussels lobby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 there were around [[15,000]] lobbyists (consultants, lawyers, associations, corporations, NGOs etc.) in [[Brussels]] seeking to influence the EU’s legislation. Some [[2,600]] special interest groups had a permanent office in Brussels. Their distribution was roughly as follows: European trade federations (32%), consultants (20%), companies (13%), NGOs (11%), national associations (10%), regional representations (6%), international organizations (5%) and [[think tank]]s (1%), (Lehmann, 2003, pp iii).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/civil_society/interest_groups/docs/workingdocparl.pdf |format=PDF |title= Lobbying in the European Union: current rules and practices |first=Wilhelm |last=Lehman |year= 2003 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apertacontrada.it/2013/02/21/form-of-government-and-lobbies-in-uk-and-ue-a-comparative-perspective/  |first= Pier Luigi |last=Petrillo |authorlink=Pier Luigi Petrillo |title=Form of government and lobbying UK and UE, a comparative perspective |date=March 2013 |publisher=Apertacontrada.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, lobby organisations sometimes hire former EU employees (a phenomenon known as the revolving door) who possess inside knowledge of the EU institutions and policy process &lt;ref name="transparency.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://transparency.eu/access-all-areas/|title=Transparency International EU (2017) Access All Areas: when EU politicians become lobbyists.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by [[Transparency International]] EU published in January 2017 analysed the career paths of former EU officials and found that 30% of Members of the [[European Parliament]] who left politics went to work for organisations on the EU lobby register after their mandate and approximately one third of Commissioners serving under Barroso took jobs in the private sector after their mandate, including for [[Uber]], [[ArcelorMittal]], [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]]. These potential conflicts of interest could be avoided if a stronger ethics framework would be established at the EU level, including an independent ethics body and longer cooling-off periods for MEPs.&lt;ref name="transparency.eu"/&gt;

In the wake of the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal]] in Washington D.C. and the massive impact this had on the lobbying scene in the [[United States]], the rules for lobbying in the EU—which until now consist of only a non-binding code of conduct-—may also be tightened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/documents/comm/green_papers/pdf/com2006_194_en.pdf Green Paper on European Transparency Initiative] [[European Commission]], 2006.  Retrieved September 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====

There is currently no regulation at all for lobbying activities in France. There is no regulated access to the French institutions and no register specific to France, but there is one for the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/news/justice/091028_fr.htm |title=Pleins feux sur les lobbies dans l'UE (28 October 2009) |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2009-10-28 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; where French lobbyists can register themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pseudo * |url=http://www.dsmw.org/lobbying.html |title=Le lobbying passe aussi par le web (12 March 2012) |publisher=Dsmw.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the internal rule of the National Assembly (art. 23 and 79) forbids members of Parliament to be linked with a particular interest. Also, there is no rule at all for consultation of interest groups by the Parliament and the Government. Nevertheless, a recent parliamentary initiative (motion for a resolution) has been launched by several MPs so as to establish a register for representatives of interest groups and lobbyists who intend to lobby the MPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/10/38944365.pdf French National Assembly : Motion for a Resolution on Lobbying (21 November 2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325060849/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/10/38944365.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobbying in the United States describes paid activity in which special interests hire professional advocates to argue for specific legislation in decision-making bodies such as the [[United States Congress]]. Lobbying in the United States could be seen to originate from Amendment I of the Constitution of the United States, which states: Congress shall make no law…abridging the right of the people peaceably…to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Some lobbyists are now using social media to reduce the cost of traditional campaigns, and to more precisely target public officials with political messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/07/13/government-lobbyists-social-media/|title=Government Lobbyists Are More Nimble Than Ever|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of published studies showed lobbying expenditure is correlated with great financial returns.  For example, a 2011 study of the 50 firms that spent the most on lobbying relative to their assets compared their financial performance against that of the [[S&amp;P 500]] in the stock market concluded that spending on lobbying was a "spectacular investment" yielding "blistering" returns comparable to a high-flying [[hedge fund]], even despite the financial downturn of the past few years.&lt;ref name=twsM23&gt;{{cite news |author= Brad Plumer |title= The outsized returns from lobbying |work= [[The Washington Post]] |quote= ...Hiring a top-flight lobbyist looks like a spectacular investment ... |date= October 10, 2011 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-outsized-returns-from-lobbying/2011/10/10/gIQADSNEaL_blog.html |accessdate= 2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 [[meta-analysis]] of previous research findings found a positive correlation between corporate political activity and firm performance.&lt;ref name=tws2NovZ111&gt;{{cite news |author1=Lux, Sean |author2=Crook, T.

Foreign-funded lobbying efforts include those of [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel]], [[Saudi Arabia lobby in the United States|Saudi Arabia]], [[Turkish lobby in the United States|Turkey]], [[Egypt lobby in the United States|Egypt]], [[Pakistani lobby in the United States|Pakistan]], and [[China Lobby|China]] lobbies. In 2010 alone, foreign governments spent approximately $460 million on lobbying members of Congress and government officials.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rollcall.com/news/Lobbying_by_Foreign_Countries_Decreases-208745-1.html Lobbying by Foreign Countries Decreases]".

===Other countries===
Other countries where lobbying is regulated in parliamentary bills include:
*'''Canada''': Canada maintains a Registry of Lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocl-cal.gc.ca/eic/site/lobbyist-lobbyiste1.nsf/eng/h_nx00269.html |title=Lobbying Act, Regulations and Code of Conduct |date=September 10, 2010 |work= |publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying of Canada |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Politics of Israel#Interest groups|'''Israel''']] (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/lobby_eng.htm |title=Lobbies in the Knesset |publisher=Knesset.gov.il |date=1997-04-01 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''India''': In [[India]], where there is no law regulating the process, lobbying had traditionally been a tool for industry bodies (like FICCI) and other pressure groups to engage with the government ahead of the national budget. One reason being that lobbying activities were repeatedly identified in the context of corruption cases. For example, in 2010 , leaked audio transcripts of Nira Radia. Not only private companies but even Indian government has been paying a fee every year since 2005 to a US firm to lobby;{{citation need|date=August 2018}} for ex. to the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal. In India, there are no laws that defined the scope of lobbying, who could undertake it, or the extent of disclosure necessary. Companies are not mandated to disclose their activities and lobbyists are neither authorized nor encouraged to reveal the names of clients or public officials they have contacted. The distinction between Lobbying and bribery still remains unclear. In 2012, Walmart revealed it had spent $25 million since 2008 on lobbying to "enhance market access for investment in India." This disclosure came weeks after the Indian government made a controversial decision to permit FDI in the country's multi-brand retail sector.

*Ukraine: In 2009, a special working group of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine developed a draft law "On Lobbying". However, this bill was not introduced into the Parliament of Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nesterovych|first=Volodymyr|date=2010|title=Legalization, accreditation, control and supervisory activity concerning lobbyists and lobbying organizations: prospects for Ukraine|url=http://vlz.in.ua/uploads/File/pdf/St/2010-і/2010-1s/Nesterovich.pdf|journal=Power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15998">A '''mechanoreceptor''' is a [[sensory receptor]] that responds to mechanical pressure or distortion. Normally there are four main types in glabrous, or hairless, [[mammalian]] skin: [[lamellar corpuscle]]s, [[tactile corpuscle]]s, [[Merkel nerve ending]]s, and [[bulbous corpuscle]]s. There are also mechanoreceptors in hairy skin, and the hair cells in thoreceptors of primates like [[rhesus monkey]]s and other mammals are similar to those of humans and also studied even in early 20th century anatomically and neurophysiologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adrian ED, Umrath K | title = The impulse discharge from the pacinian corpuscle | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–54 | date = October 1929 | pmid = 16994055 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1929.sp002601 | pmc = 1402853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invertebrate mechanoreceptors include [[campaniform sensilla]] and [[slit sensilla]], among others.

==Mechanism of sensation==
In [[somatosensory]] [[sensory transduction|transduction]], the [[afferent neuron]]s transmit messages through [[synapse]]s in the [[dorsal column nuclei]], where second-order neurons send the signal to the [[thalamus]] and synapse with third-order neurons in the [[ventrobasal complex]]. The third-order neurons then send the signal to the [[somatosensory cortex]].

===Feedback===
More recent work has expanded the role of the cutaneous mechanoreceptors for feedback in [[fine motor control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johansson RS, Flanagan JR | title = Coding and use of tactile signals from the fingertips in object manipulation tasks | journal = Nature Reviews.

==Types==
[[File:Blausen 0809 Skin TactileReceptors.png|thumb|Tactile receptors.]]
In glabrous (hairless) skin, there are four principal types of mechanoreceptors, each shaped according to its function. The [[tactile corpuscle]]s (also known as Meissner corpuscles) respond to light touch, and adapt rapidly to changes in texture (vibrations around 50&amp;nbsp;Hz). The [[bulbous corpuscle]]s (also known as Ruffini endings) detect tension deep in the skin and [[fascia]]. The [[Merkel nerve ending]]s (also known as Merkel discs) detect sustained pressure. The [[lamellar corpuscle]]s (also known as Pacinian corpuscles) in the skin and fascia detect rapid vibrations (of about 200–300&amp;nbsp;Hz).

Receptors in [[hair follicle]]s sense when a [[hair]] changes position. Indeed, the most sensitive mechanoreceptors in humans are the [[hair cell]]s in the [[cochlea]] of the [[inner ear]] (no relation to the follicular receptors – they are named for the hair-like mechanosensory [[stereocilia]] they possess); these receptors [[Signal transduction|transduce]] [[sound]] for the brain.

Mechanosensory [[free nerve ending]]s detect touch, pressure, and stretching.

[[Baroreceptors]] are a type of mechanoreceptor sensory neuron that is excited by stretch of the blood vessel.

===Cutaneous=== &lt;!-- Cutaneous mechanoreceptors redirects here. --&gt;
Cutaneous mechanoreceptors respond to mechanical stimuli that result from physical interaction, including pressure and vibration. They are located in the skin, like other [[cutaneous receptors]]. They are all innervated by [[Aβ fibers]], except the mechanorecepting [[free nerve endings]], which are innervated by [[A delta fiber|Aδ fibers]]. Cutaneous mechanoreceptors can be categorized by morphology, by what kind of sensation they perceive, and by the rate of adaptation. Furthermore, each has a different [[receptive field]].

*The '''Slowly Adapting type 1 (SA1) mechanoreceptor''', with the [[Merkel corpuscle end-organ]], underlies the perception of form and roughness on the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson KO, Hsiao SS | title = Neural mechanisms of tactual form and texture perception | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 15 | pages = 227–50 | pmid = 1575442 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ne.15.030192.001303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have small receptive fields and produce sustained responses to static stimulation.
*The '''Slowly Adapting type 2 (SA2) mechanoreceptors''', with the [[Ruffini corpuscle end-organ]], respond to skin stretch, but have not been closely linked to either proprioceptive or mechanoreceptive roles in perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torebjörk HE, Ochoa JL | title = Specific sensations evoked by activity in single identified sensory units in man | journal = Acta Physiologica Scandinavica | volume = 110 | issue = 4 | pages = 445–7 | date = December 1980 | pmid = 7234450 | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-1716.1980.tb06695.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also produce sustained responses to static stimulation, but have large receptive fields.

====By sensation====
{{Further|Cutaneous receptor modalities}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}

====By rate of adaptation==== &lt;!--Rapidly adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors, Slowly adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors, rapidly adapting, intermediate adapting and slowly adapting redirect here--&gt;
Cutaneous mechanoreceptors can also be separated into categories based on their rates of adaptation.  When a mechanoreceptor receives a stimulus, it begins to fire impulses or [[action potential]]s at an elevated frequency (the stronger the stimulus, the higher the frequency).  The cell, however, will soon "adapt" to a constant or static stimulus, and the pulses will subside to a normal rate.  Receptors that adapt quickly (i.e. quickly return to a normal pulse rate) are referred to as "phasic".  Those receptors that are slow to return to their normal firing rate are called [[tonic (physiology)|tonic]]. Phasic mechanoreceptors are useful in sensing such things as texture or vibrations, whereas tonic receptors are useful for temperature and [[proprioception]] among others.

*'''Slowly adapting''': Slowly adapting mechanoreceptors include [[Merkel corpuscle end-organ|Merkel]] and [[Ruffini corpuscle end-organ]]s, and some [[free nerve endings]].
**Slowly adapting type I mechanoreceptors have multiple [[Merkel corpuscle end-organ]]s.
**Slowly adapting type II mechanoreceptors have single [[Ruffini corpuscle end-organ]]s.
*'''Intermediate adapting''': Some [[free nerve endings]] are intermediate adapting.
*'''Rapidly adapting''': Rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors include [[Meissner corpuscle end-organ]]s, [[Pacinian corpuscle end-organs]], [[hair follicle receptors]] and some [[free nerve endings]].
**Rapidly adapting type I mechanoreceptors have multiple [[Meissner corpuscle end-organ]]s.
**Rapidly adapting type II mechanoreceptors (usually called Pacinian) have single [[Pacinian corpuscle end-organs]].

====Receptive field====
Cutaneous mechanoreceptors with small, accurate [[receptive field]]s are found in areas needing accurate taction (e.g. the fingertips). In the fingertips and lips, innervation density of slowly adapting type I and rapidly adapting type I mechanoreceptors are greatly increased. These two types of mechanoreceptors have small discrete receptive fields and are thought to underlie most low-threshold use of the fingers in assessing texture, surface slip, and flutter. Mechanoreceptors found in areas of the body with less tactile acuity tend to have larger [[receptive fields]].

===Others===
Other mechanoreceptors than cutaneous ones include the [[hair cell]]s, which are [[sensory receptor]]s in the [[vestibular system]] of the [[inner ear]], where they contribute to the [[auditory system]] and [[equilibrioception]]. In addition to this, mechanoreceptors aid ''Dionaea muscipula Ellis'' (Venus Fly Trap) in capturing sizable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Daniel | last = Chamovitz | name-list-format = vanc | title = What a plant knows : a field guide to the senses |date=2012|publisher=Scientific American/Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=9780374533885|edition=1st |location=New York|oclc=755641050}}&lt;/ref&gt; prey effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkov AG, Forde-Tuckett V, Volkova MI, Markin VS | title = Morphing structures of the Dionaea muscipula Ellis during the trap opening and closing | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = e27793 | date = 2014-02-10 | pmid = 24618927 | pmc = 4091236 | doi = 10.4161/psb.27793 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also [[Juxtacapillary (J) receptors]], which respond to events such as [[pulmonary edema]], [[pulmonary embolism|pulmonary emboli]], [[pneumonia]], and [[barotrauma]].

====Ligamentous====
There are four types of mechanoreceptors embedded in ligaments. As all these types of mechanoreceptors are myelinated, they can rapidly transmit sensory information regarding joint positions to the central nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michelson JD, Hutchins C | title = Mechanoreceptors in human ankle ligaments | journal = The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. British Volume | volume = 77 | issue = 2 | pages = 219–24 | date = March 1995 | pmid = 7706334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Type I''': (small) Low threshold, slow adapting in both static and dynamic settings
*'''Type II''': (medium) Low threshold, rapidly adapting in dynamic settings
*'''Type III''': (large) High threshold, slowly adapting in dynamic settings
*'''Type IV''': (very small) High threshold pain receptors that communicate injury 
Type II and Type III mechanoreceptors in particular are believed to be linked to one's sense of [[proprioception]]

==Lamellar corpuscle==
{{main|Lamellar corpuscle}}
Lamellar corpuscles, or Pacinian corpuscles, are pressure receptors located in the skin and also in various internal organs. Each is connected to a sensory neuron.  
Because of its relatively large size, a single lamellar corpuscle can be isolated and its properties studied. Mechanical pressure of varying strength and frequency can be applied to the corpuscle by stylus, and the resulting electrical activity detected by electrodes attached to the preparation.

Deforming the corpuscle creates a generator potential in the sensory neuron arising within it. This is a graded response: the greater the deformation, the greater the generator potential. If the generator potential reaches threshold, a volley of action potentials (nerve impulses) are triggered at the first [[node of Ranvier]] of the sensory neuron.

Once threshold is reached, the magnitude of the stimulus is encoded in the frequency of impulses generated in the neuron. So the more massive or rapid the deformation of a single corpuscle, the higher the frequency of nerve impulses generated in its neuron.

The optimal sensitivity of a lamellar corpuscle is 250&amp;nbsp;Hz, the frequency range generated upon finger tips by textures made of features smaller than 200&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheibert J, Leurent S, Prevost A, Debrégeas G | title = The role of fingerprints in the coding of tactile information probed with a biomimetic sensor | journal = Science | volume = 323 | issue = 5920 | pages = 1503–6 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19179493 | doi = 10.1126/science.1166467 | arxiv = 0911.4885 | bibcode = 2009Sci...323.1503S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muscle spindles and the stretch reflex==

The [[knee jerk]] is the popularly known [[stretch reflex]] (involuntary kick of the lower leg) induced by tapping the knee with a rubber-headed hammer. The hammer strikes a [[tendon]] that [[insertion (anatomy)|inserts]] an [[extensor]] muscle in the front of the thigh into the lower leg. Tapping the tendon stretches the thigh muscle, which activates [[stretch receptor]]s within the muscle called [[muscle spindle]]s. Each muscle spindle consists of sensory nerve endings wrapped around special muscle fibers called [[intrafusal muscle fiber|spindle fiber]]s (also called intrafusal fibers). Stretching a spindle fiber initiates a volley of impulses in the sensory neuron (a [[Type Ia sensory fiber|I-a]] neuron) attached to it. The impulses travel along the sensory axon to the spinal cord where they form several kinds of synapses:

# Some of the branches of the I-a axons synapse directly with [[alpha motor neuron]]s.These carry impulses back to the same muscle causing it to contract. The leg straightens. 
# Some of the branches of the I-a axons synapse with inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord. These, in turn, synapse with motor neurons leading back to the antagonistic muscle, a flexor in the back of the thigh. By inhibiting the flexor, these interneurons aid contraction of the extensor. 
# Still other branches of the I-a axons synapse with interneurons leading to brain centers, e.g., the cerebellum, that coordinate body movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = John W. | last = Kimball | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/M/Mechanoreceptors.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110227051819/http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/M/Mechanoreceptors.html | archive-date = 27 February 2011 | title = Mechanoreceptors | work = Kimball's Biology Pages | date = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative pledge''' is a provision in a [[contract]] which prohibits a party to the contract from creating any [[security interest]]s over certain property specified in the provision.

Negative pledges often appear in security documents, where they operate to prohibit the person who is granting the security interest from creating any other security interests over the same property, which might compete with (or rank ''[[pari passu]]'' with) the security of the first [[secured creditor]] under the security document in which the negative pledge appears.

In Australia, negative pledge lending took off after a substantial deal by [[Hanson Australia|Pioneer Concrete]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trevor Sykes]], ''The Bold Riders'', second edition, 1996, {{ISBN|1-86448-184-6}}, pages 7-10&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a new way of lending, which allowed the banks to lend to corporations, something previously the domain of life insurers.

Negative pledge clauses are almost universal in modern unsecured commercial loan documents. The purpose is to ensure that a borrower, having taken out an [[unsecured loan]], cannot subsequently take out another loan with a different lender, securing the subsequent loan on the specified assets. If the borrower could do this, the original lender would be disadvantaged because the subsequent lender would have first call on the assets in an [[event of default]].

{{IPA notice}}
{{Catalan-Valencian cultural domain|image=[[File:Catalan dialects-en.png|220px|expanded=language]]}}

'''Northern Catalan''' ({{lang-ca|català septentrional}}, {{IPA-ca|kətəˈla səptəntɾiuˈnal|pron}}, also known as ''rossellonès'') is a [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[dialect]] mostly spoken in [[Northern Catalonia]], but also extending in the northeast part of [[Southern Catalonia]] in a transition zone with [[Central Catalan]].

Like other Eastern Catalan dialects, unstressed {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} are realized as schwa {{IPA|[ə]}}, and {{IPA|[u]}} substitutes unstressed {{IPA|/o/}}. It is has only five stressed vowel, the smallest number of any Catalan dialect: {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}.

There are some instances of historic stressed {{IPA|/o/}} that has changed to {{IPA|/u/}}: ''canigó'' &gt; ''canigú''.

As in [[Balearic dialect]], final ''a'' is not pronounced in words ending with ''ia'' if the stress is before the penultimate [[syllable]].

Some subdialects keep the singular masculine definite article ''lo'', as in [[North-Western Catalan]] and many varieties of [[Occitan language|Occitan]].

Northern Catalan has a large body of words imported from [[French language|French]] and Occitan. It also features some grammatical forms and structures that are typical of Occitan, such as the use of a lone post-verbal ''pas'', rather than a lone preverbal ''no'' to express basic negation (Northern Catalan ''canti pas'' vs. [[Central Catalan]] ''no canto'', 'I don't sing' or 'I'm not singing'); ''pas'' is also used in some other Catalan dialects for emphasis but always with ''no'' before the verb (Central Catalan ''no canto pas'', 'I do '''not''' sing' or 'I am '''not''' singing').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4722">In [[applied statistics]], a '''partial regression plot''' attempts to show the effect of adding another variable to a model that already has one or more independent variables. Partial regression plots are also referred to as '''added variable plots''', '''adjusted variable plots''', and '''individual coefficient plots'''.

When performing a [[linear regression]] with a single [[independent variable]], a [[scatter plot]] of the [[response variable]] against the independent variable provides a good indication of the nature of the relationship. If there is more than one independent variable, things become more complicated. Although it can still be useful to generate scatter plots of the response variable against each of the independent variables, this does not take into account the effect of the other independent variables in the model.

==Calculation==

Partial regression plots are formed by:
#Computing the residuals of regressing the response variable against the independent variables but omitting '''X'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
#Computing the residuals from regressing ''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; against the remaining independent variables
#Plotting the residuals from (1) against the residuals from (2). 
Velleman and Welsch&lt;ref name=VW&gt;

|doi = 10.2307/2683296

express this mathematically as:
:&lt;math&gt;
Y_{\bullet[i]}\mathrm{\ versus\ }X_{i\bullet[i]} 
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''Y''&lt;sub&gt;•[i]&lt;/sub&gt; = residuals from regressing Y (the response variable) against all the independent variables except Xi
:''X''&lt;sub&gt;i•[i]&lt;/sub&gt; = residuals from regressing ''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; against the remaining independent variables.

==Properties==

Velleman and Welsch&lt;ref name=VW/&gt; list the following useful properties for this plot:
#The least squares linear fit to this plot has the slope &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and intercept zero.
#The residuals from the least squares linear fit to this plot are identical to the residuals from the least squares fit of the original model (Y against all the independent variables including Xi).
#The influences of individual data values on the estimation of a coefficient are easy to see in this plot.
#It is easy to see many kinds of failures of the model or violations of the underlying assumptions (nonlinearity, [[heteroscedasticity]], unusual patterns). .

Partial regression plots are related to, but distinct from, [[partial residual plot]]s. Partial regression plots are most commonly used to identify data points with high [[leverage (statistics)|leverage]] and influential data points that might not have high leverage. Partial residual plots are most commonly used to identify the nature of the relationship between ''Y'' and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (given the effect of the other independent variables in the model). Note that since the [[simple correlation]] between the two sets of residuals plotted is equal to the [[partial correlation]] between the response variable and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, partial regression plots will show the correct strength of the linear relationship between the response variable and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. This is not true for partial residual plots. On the other hand, for the partial regression plot, the x-axis is not ''X''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. This limits its usefulness in determining the need for a transformation (which is the primary purpose of the partial residual plot).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2452">A '''peaceworker''' is an individual or member of an organization that undertakes to resolve violent conflict, prevent the rise of new violent conflicts, and rebuild societies damaged by war.

The term peaceworker is usually reserved for civilian, unarmed members of [[non-governmental organizations]]. Peacework is also carried out by many armed organizations such as the [[UN]], but armed personnel are seldom called peaceworkers.

== Peacework ==
Peaceworker duties include the following:
* Bringing conflicting parties together, opening channels of communication and helping to broker a ceasefire or peace agreement
* Monitoring voting booths, providing technical expertise and other forms of support in order to help ensure a free and fair electioneering environment
* Providing protective accompaniment of people at risk, monitoring borders and other actions for stabilizing preserve ceasefire agreements and preserving human life
* Reintegrating ex-combatants into society
* Promoting a respect for human rights within the local and national legal system, strengthening local institutions and civil society organizations that defend human rights

== Peaceworker Training ==
Peaceworker training and guidance is provided by organizations such as [[International Alert]]. University-provided [[Peace and conflict studies]] courses also provide valuable and relevant knowledge. As peace work can utilize a very wide variety of skills, it allows those with established, unrelated careers to take up peace work without having to abandon what they have already learned.

== Peaceworker organizations ==
Any organization dedicated to human rights, humanitarian aid and conflict management could be said to employ peace workers. The following is just a small sample of the dozens of organizations worldwide that provide these services.
* [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]]
* International Alert
* [[Peace Brigades International]]
* [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]]

'''Personal experience''' of a [[human being]] is the moment-to-moment [[experience]] and [[sensory awareness]] of internal and external [[event (philosophy)|events]] or a sum of experiences forming an empirical unity such as a period of life.

==History==
An early belief of some philosophers of [[Ancient Greece]] was that the [[mind]] was like a [[Analog recording|recording]] device and simply kept somehow-objective records of what the [[senses]] experienced. This was believed in the Western world into the 20th century until [[cognitive psychology]] experiments decisively proved that it was not true, and that many events were simply filled in by the mind, based on what "should be". This, among other things, explained why [[witness|eyewitness]] accounts of events often were so widely varied.

In [[Ancient Rome]] it was believed that personal experience was part of some divine or species-wide [[collective experience]]. This gave rise to notions of [[racial memory]], [[national mission]], and such notions as [[racism]] and [[patriotism]]. It was likely easier to create [[political movement]]s and military morale with such notions, than a strictly personal idea of experience. [[Carl Jung]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] were notable investigators of these ideas of collective experience in the 20th century.

During [[the Enlightenment]], there was rigorous investigation of these ideas. [[Immanuel Kant]] noted that it was only possible to explain "experience and its objects" as a consequence of each other: either experience makes those objects possible, or those objects make experience possible. This is seen today as [[Epistemological dualism|dualism]], and denying the possibility of a third thing making both experience and whatever reality its objects have, both possible. That thing could be a more universal [[cognition]], as proposed in some versions of [[Christianity]] or [[Gaia philosophy]].

'''Privation''' is the absence or lack of basic necessities, such as food and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/privation |title=The Free Dictionary - Privation |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
In psychology, privation occurs when a child has no opportunity to form a relationship with a parent figure, or when such relationship is distorted, due to their treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Angles on Applied Psychology | publisher=Nelson Thornes | year=2003 | pages=219 | isbn=978-0-7487-7259-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbdQf0P05ZkC&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;dq=privation%20psychology&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q=privation%20psychology&amp;f=false | last1=Russell | first1=Julia | last2=Jarvis | first2=Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is different to [[Social deprivation|deprivation]], which occurs when an established relationship is severed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Brain |first1=Christine |last2=Mukherji |first2=Penny |title=Understanding child psychology |publisher=Nelson Thornes |edition=New |date=7 June 2005 |ISBN=978-0-7487-9084-5 |pages=44–45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jhhYHW1ieQEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+Child+Psychology&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ztJrTvv_Cono-gaJttm4DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is understood that privation can produce social, emotional and intellectual problems for children; however, how inevitable such problems become as a result of privation, and the extent to which they can be reversed, remains an issue of debate among [[psychologist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Angles on Child Psychology | publisher=Nelson Thornes | year=2001 | pages=53 | isbn=978-0-7487-5975-0 | last1=Jarvis | first1=Matt | last2=Chandler | first2=Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In philosophy, privation may refer to the absence of a necessary quality in the universe. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} &lt;!-- who gives such a definition?--&gt;

For example, as part of [[Augustinian theodicy|his theodicy]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] denied the existence of [[evil]] as its own entity; rather, he described evil as a privation, or going wrong, of good, ''[[privatio boni]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Descartes and Augustine | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2002 | author=Menn, Stephen | isbn=978-0-521-01284-3 | page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] argued that privation is not necessarily a bad thing: it would be trivial to regard the privation of hair – [[baldness]] – as an evil.

'''Real Snail Mail''' is a webmail service created by artists Vicky Isley and Paul Smith aka [[boredomresearch]], which uses real live snails equipped with Radio Frequency Identification ([[RFID]]) tags to deliver electronic messages. The project was [[Commission (art)|commissioned]]  as part of the Tagged Exhibition in Space Media Arts, London in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/2006/10/realsnailmail-e.php Real snail email - we make money not art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/technology/061013_snail_mail.html Snail Mail with Real Snails | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and was developed during boredomresearchs’ research fellowship in the Computer Animation Research Centre at [[Bournemouth University]]. 

The installation version of Real Snail Mail was displayed at [[SIGGRAPH]]08 in [[Los Angeles]] (11–15 August 2008), at the British Science Festival (14–19 September 2009), and at [DAM]Berlin as part of boredomresearch’s solo exhibition, ‘Chasing Stillness’ (29 August - 24 October 2009).

== How it works ==

Each snail "agent" is fitted with a [[RFID]] tag on its shell.
Users of the service send a message via the Real Snail Mail website which is routed to the tank to await collection by a snail "agent".
As the snails wander around the tank, they come into range of a RFID reader, which assigns the e-mail message to the RFID tag.
The references to the electronic messages are then physically carried around the tank by the snails until one of them passes close to a second reader.
As soon as this happens, the second reader triggers the message to be forwarded over the net in the usual way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4397">{{for|the distinction between real purchasing power and nominal value|Real versus nominal value (economics)}}
The distinction between '''real value''' and '''nominal value''' occurs in many fields. From a philosophical viewpoint, nominal value represents an accepted condition, which is a goal or an approximation, as opposed to the real value, which is always present. 

==Measurement==
{{mergefrom|Nominal size|date=November 2018}}
{{see also|Nominal size}}

In measurement, a nominal value is often a value existing in name only;&lt;ref&gt;[[ASTM]] D3039, D4139, and others&lt;/ref&gt; it is assigned as a convenient designation rather than calculated by  [[data analysis]] or following usual [[rounding]] methods.  The use of nominal values can be based on [[de facto standard]]s or some [[technical standard]]s.

All real measurements have some variation depending on the [[accuracy and precision]] of the [[test method]] and the [[measurement uncertainty]].  The use of reported values often involves [[engineering tolerance]]s.

One way to consider this is that the real value often has the characteristics of an [[irrational number]]. In real-world measuring situations, improving the measurement technique will eventually begin yielding unpredictable least significant digits. For example, a 1-inch long [[gauge block]] will measure to be exactly 1&amp;nbsp;inch long until the measuring techniques reach a certain degree of precision. As techniques improve beyond this threshold, it will become clear that 1&amp;nbsp;inch is not the real value of the gauge block length, but some other number approximates it.

==Engineering==
In various subfields of [[engineering]], a nominal value is one for which the "name" for the value is close to, but not the same as, the actual value.  Some examples:

* For [[dimensional lumber]] in North America, a "two by four" is not 2&amp;nbsp;inches by 4&amp;nbsp;inches, but rather between 1⅜ and 1⅝ inches thick and between 3⅜ and 3⅝ inches wide, sized to the equivalent rough hewn piece of [[softwood]] for nominal structural design purposes. The ⅛-inch tolerances absorb the natural variation. 
* A machine is designed to operate at some particular condition, often stated on the device's nameplate.   For example, a [[pump]] is designed to deliver its nominal pressure and flow while operating at its nominal speed and power.   Actual operating conditions may vary.
* Electricity:
**[[Mains electricity]] is nominally 230 [[Volt|V]] in the [[European Union]], but is allowed to vary ±10%.  In North America, the nominal voltage is 120 V, with variance allowed from 114 V to 126 V (±5%). Voltage is also supplied at 208 V, 240 V and 480 V with similar tolerances. In general, electrical devices are designed to work with one nominal [[voltage]], which represents a band of possible actual voltages, [[power factor]] and [[Alternating current|AC]] waveform shapes.
** Traction power networks routinely operate well above the nominal voltage, but still within the tolerance. For example, a [[streetcar]] traction power could be rated 600 ±10% volts nominal, but the actual overhead line voltage would normally be close to 660 volts, only dropping near the nominal value in exceptional conditions.
** [[NiMH]] and [[NiCd]] [[rechargeable batteries]] have a nominal voltage of 1.2 V, but will actually supply real voltages ranging from about 1.45 V to 1.0 V during discharge.
** A solar panel designed to charge a "12 V [[lead–acid battery]]" will often be called a "12-volt panel", even though the actual voltage while charging (of both the panel and the battery) is around 14 V, and the [[open-circuit voltage]] of the solar panel is around 17 V.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.freesunpower.com/solarpanels.php "Basic Tutorials: Solar Panels"].
Retrieved 2014-06-25.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cases involve diameter, speed, and volume.

Sometimes the word "nominal" is misused in engineering contexts as a synonym for "normal" or "expected"; for example, ''The rotor resistances on all the other operating wheels are nominal.''&lt;ref name=JPL&gt;

'''Shop-ins''' were a form of public protest used briefly in 1964 as part of the [[Civil rights movement]]. 

Demonstrators would enter a store posing as customers, pile a basket or trolley high with groceries, take them through the checkout and then refuse to pay, leaving the goods piled at the checkout.&lt;ref name="Sarasota"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SrgeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8osEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7344,3644577&amp;dq=shop-ins&amp;hl=en ''Sarasota Journal: Shop-Ins Newest Weapon In Use By Demonstrators'', February 28th 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; The tactic was used primarily by the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] to protest against [[Lucky Stores]] hiring policies.&lt;ref name=Sarasota/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9xIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v-gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5721,3791531&amp;dq=shop-ins&amp;hl=en ''The Spokesman-Review: CORE goes shopping'' February 26th 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Research unit, Wharton School of Finance and Commerce; ''Report: The Racial policies of American industry'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972, {{ISBN|9780812290691}}, p118&lt;/ref&gt; Their 1964 protest ended after a meeting between CORE members and Lucky Stores' representatives, chaired by San Francisco mayor [[John F.

[[Image:tetrahedron.png|thumb|A regular 3-simplex or [[tetrahedron]]]]
In [[geometry]], a '''simplex''' (plural: '''simplexes''' or '''simplices''') is a generalization of the notion of a [[triangle]] or [[tetrahedron]] to arbitrary [[dimensions]].
Specifically, a '''''k''-simplex''' is a ''k''-dimensional [[polytope]] which is the [[convex hull]] of its ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]].  
More formally, suppose the ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 points &lt;math&gt;u_0,\dots, u_k \in \mathbb{R}^{k}&lt;/math&gt; are [[affinely independent]], which means &lt;math&gt; u_1 - u_0,\dots, u_k-u_0 &lt;/math&gt; are [[linearly independent]].
Then, the simplex determined by them is the set of points

:&lt;math&gt; C = \left\{\theta_0 u_0 + \dots +\theta_k u_k ~\bigg|~ \sum_{i=0}^{k} \theta_i=1 \mbox{ and } \theta_i \ge 0 \mbox{ for all } i\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a 2-simplex is a triangle, a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron, and a 4-simplex is a [[5-cell]].  A single [[point (geometry)|point]] may be considered a 0-simplex, and a [[line segment]] may be considered a 1-simplex. A simplex may be defined as the smallest [[convex set]] containing the given vertices.

A '''regular simplex'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Elte | first = E. L. | title = The Semiregular Polytopes of the Hyperspaces | publisher = University of Groningen | location = Groningen | year = 1912}} Chapter IV, five dimensional semiregular polytope&lt;/ref&gt; is a simplex that is also a [[regular polytope]]. A regular ''n''-simplex may be constructed from a regular (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex to all original vertices by the common edge length.

The '''standard simplex''' or '''probability simplex''' &lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;{{cite book|title=Convex Optimization|first1=Stephen P.|last1=Boyd|first2=Lieven|last2=Vandenberghe|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83378-3|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the simplex formed from the ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 standard unit vectors, or 

:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{k+1} : x_0 + \dots + x_k = 1, x_i \ge 0, i=0, \dots, k \}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[topology]] and [[combinatorics]], it is common to “glue together” simplices to form a [[simplicial complex]].  The associated combinatorial structure is called an [[abstract simplicial complex]], in which context the word “simplex” simply means any [[finite set]] of vertices.

==History==
The concept of a simplex was known to [[William Kingdon Clifford]], who wrote about these shapes in 1886 but called them "prime confines". 
[[Henri Poincaré]], writing about [[algebraic topology]] in 1900, called them "generalized tetrahedra".
In 1902 [[Pieter Hendrik Schoute]] described the concept first with the [[Latin]] superlative ''simplicissimum'' ("simplest") and then with the same Latin adjective in the normal form ''simplex'' ("simple").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/s.html|title=Simplex|work=Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics|first=Jeff|last=Miller|accessdate=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convex hull of any nonempty subset of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 points that define an ''n''-simplex is called a '''face''' of the simplex. Faces are simplices themselves. In particular, the convex hull of a subset of size ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 (of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 defining points) is an ''m''-simplex, called an '''''m''-face''' of the ''n''-simplex. The 0-faces (i.e., the defining points themselves as sets of size 1) are called the '''vertices''' (singular: vertex), the 1-faces are called the '''edges''', the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-faces are called the '''facets''', and the sole ''n''-face is the whole ''n''-simplex itself. In general, the number of ''m''-faces is equal to the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n+1}{m+1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, ''Regular polytopes'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the number of ''m''-faces of an ''n''-simplex may be found in column (''m'' + 1) of row (''n'' + 1) of [[Pascal's triangle]]. A simplex ''A'' is a '''coface''' of a simplex ''B'' if ''B'' is a face of ''A''. ''Face'' and ''facet'' can have different meanings when describing types of simplices in a [[simplicial complex]]; see [[Simplicial complex#Definitions|simplical complex]] for more detail.

The '''regular simplex''' family is the first of three [[regular polytope]] families, labeled by [[Coxeter]] as ''α&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the other two being the [[cross-polytope]] family, labeled as ''β&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the [[hypercube]]s, labeled as ''γ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. A fourth family, the [[hypercubic honeycomb|infinite tessellation of hypercubes]], he labeled as ''δ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The number of 1-faces (edges) of the ''n''-simplex is the ''n''-th [[triangle number]], the number of 2-faces of the ''n''-simplex is the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)th [[tetrahedron number]], the number of 3-faces of the ''n''-simplex is the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)th 5-cell number, and so on.

An (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-simplex can be constructed as a join (∨ operator) of an ''n''-simplex and a point,&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). An (''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-simplex can be constructed as a join of an ''m''-simplex and an ''n''-simplex. The two simplices are oriented to be completely normal from each other, with translation in a direction orthogonal to both of them. A 1-simplex is the join of two points: (&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) =&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). A general 2-simplex (scalene triangle) is the join of three points: (&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). An [[isosceles triangle]] is the join of a 1-simplex and a point: {&amp;nbsp;}&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). An [[equilateral triangle]] is 3&amp;middot;(&amp;nbsp;) or&amp;nbsp;{3}. A general 3-simplex is the join of 4 points: (&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). A 3-simplex with mirror symmetry can be expressed as the join of an edge and two points: {&amp;nbsp;}&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;). A 3-simplex with triangular symmetry can be expressed as the join of an equilateral triangle and 1 point: 3.( )∨( ) or {3}∨( ). A [[regular tetrahedron]] is 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) or {3,3} and so on.

In some conventions,&lt;ref&gt;Kozlov, Dimitry, ''Combinatorial Algebraic Topology'', 2008, Springer-Verlag (Series: Algorithms and Computation in Mathematics)&lt;/ref&gt; the empty set is defined to be a (−1)-simplex.  The definition of the simplex above still makes sense if ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1.  This convention is more common in applications to algebraic topology (such as [[simplicial homology]]) than to the study of polytopes.

== The standard simplex ==
[[Image:2D-simplex.svg|150px|thumb|right|The standard 2-simplex in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]
The '''standard ''n''-simplex''' (or '''unit ''n''-simplex''') is the subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; given by

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n = \left\{(t_0,\dots,t_n)\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}~\big|~\sum_{i = 0}^n t_i = 1 \text{ and } t_i \ge 0 \text{ for all } i\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The simplex Δ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; lies in the [[affine hyperplane]] obtained by removing the restriction ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0 in the above definition.

The ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 vertices of the standard ''n''-simplex are the points ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, where
:''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (1, 0, 0, ..., 0),
:''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0),
:&lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt;
:''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (0, 0, 0, ..., 1).
There is a canonical map from the standard ''n''-simplex to an arbitrary ''n''-simplex with vertices (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) given by
:&lt;math&gt;(t_0,\ldots,t_n) \mapsto \sum_{i = 0}^n t_i v_i&lt;/math&gt;
The coefficients ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are called the [[barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] of a point in the ''n''-simplex.  Such a general simplex is often called an '''affine ''n''-simplex''', to emphasize that the canonical map is an [[affine transformation]]. It is also sometimes called an '''oriented affine ''n''-simplex''' to emphasize that the canonical map may be [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation preserving]] or reversing.

More generally, there is a canonical map from the standard &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-simplex (with ''n'' vertices) onto any [[polytope]] with ''n'' vertices, given by the same equation (modifying indexing):
:&lt;math&gt;(t_1,\ldots,t_n) \mapsto \sum_{i = 1}^n t_i v_i&lt;/math&gt;
These are known as [[generalized barycentric coordinates]], and express every polytope as the ''image'' of a simplex: &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{n-1} \twoheadrightarrow P.&lt;/math&gt;

A commonly used function from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to the interior of the standard &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-simplex is the [[softmax function]], or normalized exponential function; this generalizes the [[standard logistic function]].

=== Examples ===

* Δ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the point {{nowrap|1= 1 in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
* Δ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the line segment joining (1,0) and (0,1) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[equilateral triangle]] with vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[regular tetrahedron]] with vertices (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0) and (0,0,0,1) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Increasing coordinates===
An alternative coordinate system is given by taking the [[indefinite sum]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s_0 &amp;= 0\\
s_1 &amp;= s_0 + t_0 = t_0\\
s_2 &amp;= s_1 + t_1 = t_0 + t_1\\
s_3 &amp;= s_2 + t_2 = t_0 + t_1 + t_2\\
&amp;\dots\\
s_n &amp;= s_{n-1} + t_{n-1} = t_0 + t_1 + \cdots + t_{n-1}\\
s_{n+1} &amp;= s_n + t_n = t_0 + t_1 + \cdots + t_n = 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
This yields the alternative presentation by ''order,'' namely as nondecreasing ''n''-tuples between 0 and 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_*^n = \left\{(s_1,\ldots,s_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n\mid 0 = s_0 \leq s_1 \leq s_2 \leq \dots \leq s_n \leq s_{n+1} = 1 \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Geometrically, this is an ''n''-dimensional subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (maximal dimension, codimension 0) rather than of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; (codimension 1). The facets, which on the standard simplex correspond to one coordinate vanishing, &lt;math&gt;t_i=0,&lt;/math&gt; here correspond to successive coordinates being equal, &lt;math&gt;s_i=s_{i+1},&lt;/math&gt; while the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] corresponds to the inequalities becoming ''strict'' (increasing sequences).

A key distinction between these presentations is the behavior under permuting coordinates – the standard simplex is stabilized by permuting coordinates, while permuting elements of the "ordered simplex" do not leave it invariant, as permuting an ordered sequence generally makes it unordered. Indeed, the ordered simplex is a (closed) [[fundamental domain]] for the action of the symmetric group on the ''n''-cube, meaning that the orbit of the ordered simplex under the ''n''! elements of the symmetric group divides the ''n''-cube into &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; mostly disjoint simplices (disjoint except for boundaries), showing that this simplex has volume &lt;math&gt;1/n!&lt;/math&gt; Alternatively, the volume can be computed by an iterated integral, whose successive integrands are &lt;math&gt;1,x,x^2/2,x^3/3!,\dots,x^n/n!&lt;/math&gt;

A further property of this presentation is that it uses the order but not addition, and thus can be defined in any dimension over any ordered set, and for example can be used to define an infinite-dimensional simplex without issues of convergence of sums.

===Projection onto the standard simplex===
Especially in numerical applications of [[probability theory]] a [[Graphical projection|projection]] onto the standard simplex is of interest. Given &lt;math&gt;\, (p_i)_i&lt;/math&gt; with possibly negative entries, the closest point &lt;math&gt;\left(t_i\right)_i&lt;/math&gt; on the simplex has coordinates 
:&lt;math&gt;t_i= \max\{p_i+\Delta\, ,0\},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is chosen such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_i\max\{p_i+\Delta\, ,0\}=1.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; can be easily calculated from sorting &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |arxiv=1101.6081|title=Projection Onto A Simplex |author=Yunmei Chen, Xiaojing Ye  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The sorting approach takes &lt;math&gt;O( n \log n)&lt;/math&gt; complexity, which can be improved to &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; complexity via [[Selection algorithm|median-finding]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = MacUlan | first1 = N. | last2 = De Paula | first2 = G. G. | doi = 10.1016/0167-6377(89)90064-3 | title = A linear-time median-finding algorithm for projecting a vector on the simplex of n | journal = Operations Research Letters | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 219 | year = 1989 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Projecting onto the simplex is computationally similar to projecting onto the &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; ball.

===Corner of cube===
Finally, a simple variant is to replace "summing to 1" with "summing to at most 1"; this raises the dimension by 1, so to simplify notation, the indexing changes:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_c^n = \left\{(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n~\big|~\sum_{i = 1}^n t_i \leq 1 \text{ and } t_i \ge 0 \text{ for all } i\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This yields an ''n''-simplex as a corner of the ''n''-cube, and is a standard orthogonal simplex. This is the simplex used in the [[simplex method]], which is based at the origin, and locally models a vertex on a polytope with ''n'' facets.

==Cartesian coordinates for regular ''n''-dimensional simplex in R&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;==
The coordinates of the vertices of a regular ''n''-dimensional simplex can be obtained from these two properties,
# For a regular simplex, the distances of its vertices to its center are equal.
# The angle subtended by any two vertices of an ''n''-dimensional simplex through its center is &lt;math&gt;\arccos\left(\tfrac{-1}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

These can be used as follows. Let vectors (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) represent the vertices of an ''n''-simplex center the origin, all [[unit vector]]s so a distance 1 from the origin, satisfying the first property. The second property means the [[dot product]] between any pair of the vectors is &lt;math&gt;-1/n&lt;/math&gt;. This can be used to calculate positions for them.

For example in three dimensions the vectors (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are the vertices of a 3-simplex or tetrahedron. Write these as

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ y_0 \\ z_0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_3 \\ y_3 \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Choose the first vector ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to have all but the first component zero, so by the first property it must be (1, 0, 0) and the vectors become

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_3 \\ y_3 \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

By the second property the dot product of ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with all other vectors is -{{frac|1|3}}, so each of their ''x'' components must equal this, and the vectors become

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_1 \\ z_1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_3 \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Next choose ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to have all but the first two elements zero. The second element is the only unknown. It can be calculated from the first property using the [[Pythagorean theorem]] (choose any of the two square roots), and so the second vector can be completed:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{\sqrt{8}}{3} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_2 \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ y_3 \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The second property can be used to calculate the remaining ''y'' components, by taking the dot product of  ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with each and solving to give

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{\sqrt{8}}{3} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \\ z_2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \\ z_3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

From which the ''z'' components can be calculated, using the Pythagorean theorem again to satisfy the first property, the two possible square roots giving the two results

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{\sqrt{8}}{3} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \\ \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \\ -\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This process can be carried out in any dimension, using ''n'' + 1 vectors, applying the first and second properties alternately to determine all the values.

=== Volume ===
The [[volume]] of an ''n''-simplex in ''n''-dimensional space with vertices (''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;
 \left|{1\over n!} \det
 \begin{pmatrix}
  v_1-v_0, &amp; v_2-v_0,&amp; \dots, &amp; v_n-v_0
 \end{pmatrix}\right|
&lt;/math&gt;

where each column of the ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' [[determinant]] is the difference between the [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] representing two vertices.&lt;ref&gt;A derivation of a very similar formula can be found in {{cite journal | last1 =  Stein | first1 = P. | year = 1966 | title = A Note on the Volume of a Simplex | journal = The American Mathematical Monthly | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 299–301 | publisher =  | jstor = 2315353 | doi =   10.2307/2315353 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common way of computing the volume of the simplex is via the [[Distance geometry#Cayley–Menger determinants|Cayley–Menger determinant]]. It can also compute the volume of a simplex embedded in a higher-dimensional space, e.g., a triangle in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Colins, Karen D. "Cayley-Menger Determinant." From MathWorld—A Wolfram Web Resource, created by Eric W. Weisstein. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cayley-MengerDeterminant.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the 1/''n''! it is the formula for the volume of an ''n''-[[parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]]. 
This can be understood as follows: Assume that ''P'' is an ''n''-parallelotope constructed on a basis &lt;math&gt;(v_0, e_1, \ldots, e_n)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^n&lt;/math&gt;.
Given a permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,\ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;, call a list of vertices &lt;math&gt;v_0,\ v_1, \ldots, v_n&lt;/math&gt; a ''n''-path if 
:&lt;math&gt;v_1 = v_0 + e_{\sigma(1)},\ v_2 = v_1 + e_{\sigma(2)},\ldots, v_n = v_{n-1}+e_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt; 
(so there are ''n''!&amp;nbsp;''n''-paths and &lt;math&gt;v_n&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the permutation). The following assertions hold:

If ''P'' is the unit ''n''-hypercube, then the union of the ''n''-simplexes formed by the convex hull of each ''n''-path is ''P'', and these simplexes are congruent and pairwise non-overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;Every ''n''-path corresponding to a permutation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the image of the ''n''-path &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0,\ v_0+e_1,\ v_0+e_1+e_2,\ldots v_0+e_1+\cdots + e_n&lt;/math&gt; by the affine isometry that sends &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0&lt;/math&gt;, and whose linear part matches &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle e_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle e_{\sigma(i)}&lt;/math&gt; for all&amp;nbsp;''i''. hence every two ''n''-paths are isometric, and so is their convex hulls; this explains the congruence of the simplexes. To show the other assertions, it suffices to remark that the interior of the simplex determined by the ''n''-path &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0,\ v_0+e_{\sigma(1)},\ v_0+e_{\sigma(1)}+e_{\sigma(2)}\ldots v_0+e_{\sigma(1)}+\cdots + e_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v_0 + (x_1+\cdots +x_n) e_{\sigma(1)} + \cdots + (x_{n-1}+x_n) e_{\sigma(n-1)} + x_n e_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 0&lt; x_i &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x_1+\cdots + x_n &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt; Hence the components of these points with respect to each corresponding permuted basis are strictly ordered in the decreasing order. That explains why the simplexes are non-overlapping. The fact that the union of the simplexes is the whole unit ''n''-hypercube follows as well, replacing the strict inequalities above by "&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \leq&lt;/math&gt;". The same arguments are also valid for a general parallelotope, except the isometry between the simplexes.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the volume of such a simplex is 

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{Vol}(P)}{n!} = \frac 1 {n!}.&lt;/math&gt;  

If ''P'' is a general parallelotope, the same assertions hold except that it is no more true, in dimension&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2, that the simplexes need to be pairwise congruent; yet their volumes remain equal, because the ''n''-parallelotop is the image of the unit ''n''-hypercube by the linear isomorphism that sends the canonical basis of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;e_1,\ldots, e_n&lt;/math&gt;. As previously, this implies that the volume of a simplex coming from a ''n''-path is:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\operatorname{Vol}(P)}{n!} = \frac{\det(e_1, \ldots, e_n)}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, given an ''n''-simplex &lt;math&gt;(v_0,\ v_1,\ v_2,\ldots v_n)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^n&lt;/math&gt;, it can be supposed that the vectors &lt;math&gt;e_1 = v_1-v_0,\ e_2 = v_2-v_1,\ldots e_n=v_n-v_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; form a basis of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^n&lt;/math&gt;. Considering the parallelotope constructed from &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_1,\ldots, e_n&lt;/math&gt;, one sees that the previous formula is valid for every simplex.

Finally, the formula at the beginning of this section is obtained by observing that 
:&lt;math&gt;\det(v_1-v_0, v_2-v_0,\ldots v_n-v_0) = \det(v_1-v_0, v_2-v_1,\ldots, v_n-v_{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

From this formula, it follows immediately that the volume under a standard ''n''-simplex (i.e. between the origin and the simplex in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;
{1 \over (n+1)!}
&lt;/math&gt;

The volume of a regular ''n''-simplex with unit side length is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\sqrt{n+1}}{n!\sqrt{2^n}}
&lt;/math&gt;

as can be seen by multiplying the previous formula by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, to get the volume under the ''n''-simplex as a function of its vertex distance ''x'' from the origin, differentiating with respect to ''x'', at &lt;math&gt;x=1/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (where the ''n''-simplex side length is 1), and normalizing by the length &lt;math&gt;dx/\sqrt{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; of the increment, &lt;math&gt;(dx/(n+1),\ldots, dx/(n+1))&lt;/math&gt;, along the normal vector.

The [[dihedral angle]] of a regular ''n''-dimensional simplex is cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(1/''n''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = The American Mathematical Monthly | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | volume = 109 | issue = 8 | date = October 2002 | pages = 756–758 | title = An Elementary Calculation of the Dihedral Angle of the Regular ''n''-Simplex | first1 = Harold R. | last1 = Parks | author1-link = Harold R.

Parks | author2 = Dean C. Wills | url = http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/11929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while its central angle is cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(-1/''n'').

===Simplices with an "orthogonal corner"===
An "orthogonal corner" means here that there is a vertex at which all adjacent edges are pairwise orthogonal. It immediately follows that all adjacent [[Face (geometry)|faces]] are pairwise orthogonal. Such simplices are generalizations of right triangles and for them there exists an ''n''-dimensional version of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:

The sum of the squared (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional volumes of the facets adjacent to the orthogonal corner equals the squared (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional volume of the facet opposite of the orthogonal corner.

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n |A_k|^2 = |A_0|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; A_1 \ldots A_n &lt;/math&gt; are facets being pairwise orthogonal to each other but not orthogonal to &lt;math&gt; A_0 &lt;/math&gt;, which is the facet opposite the orthogonal corner.

For a 2-simplex the theorem is the [[Pythagorean theorem]] for triangles with a right angle and for a 3-simplex it is [[de Gua's theorem]] for a tetrahedron 
with an orthogonal corner.

===Relation to the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-hypercube===
The [[Hasse diagram]] of the face lattice of an ''n''-simplex is isomorphic to the graph of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-[[hypercube]]'s edges, with the hypercube's vertices mapping to each of the ''n''-simplex's elements, including the entire simplex and the null polytope as the extreme points of the lattice (mapped to two opposite vertices on the hypercube). This fact may be used to efficiently enumerate the simplex's face lattice, since more general face lattice enumeration algorithms are more computationally expensive.

The ''n''-simplex is also the [[vertex figure]] of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-hypercube. It is also the [[Facet (geometry)|facet]] of the (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-[[orthoplex]].

===Topology===
[[Topology|Topologically]], an ''n''-simplex is [[topologically equivalent|equivalent]] to an [[ball (mathematics)|''n''-ball]]. Every ''n''-simplex is an ''n''-dimensional [[manifold with corners]].

===Probability===
{{Main article|Categorical distribution}}

In probability theory, the points of the standard ''n''-simplex in (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-space are the space of possible parameters (probabilities) of the [[categorical distribution]] on ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 possible outcomes.

===Compounds===
Since all simplices are self-dual, they can form a series of compounds;

* Two triangles form a [[hexagram]] {6/2}.
* Two tetrahedra form a [[compound of two tetrahedra]] or [[stellated octahedron]].
* Two 5-cells form a [[compound of two 5-cells]] in four dimensions.

== Algebraic topology&lt;!--'Singular n-simplex' redirects here--&gt; ==
In [[algebraic topology]], simplices are used as building blocks to construct an interesting class of [[topological space]]s called [[simplicial complex]]es. These spaces are built from simplices glued together in a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] fashion. Simplicial complexes are used to define a certain kind of [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] called [[simplicial homology]].

A finite set of ''k''-simplexes embedded in an [[open subset]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is called an '''affine ''k''-chain'''. The simplexes in a chain need not be unique; they may occur with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]. Rather than using standard set notation to denote an affine chain, it is instead the standard practice to use plus signs to separate each member in the set. If some of the simplexes have the opposite [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], these are prefixed by a minus sign. If some of the simplexes occur in the set more than once, these are prefixed with an integer count. Thus, an affine chain takes the symbolic form of a sum with integer coefficients.

Note that each facet of an ''n''-simplex is an affine (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-simplex, and thus the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of an ''n''-simplex is an affine ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1-chain. Thus, if we denote one positively oriented affine simplex as

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=[v_0,v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n]&lt;/math&gt;

with the &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt; denoting the vertices, then the boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of ''σ'' is the chain

:&lt;math&gt;\partial\sigma = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j [v_0,\ldots,v_{j-1},v_{j+1},\ldots,v_n].&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from this expression, and the linearity of the boundary operator,  that the boundary of the boundary of a simplex is zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^2\sigma = \partial ( ~ \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j [v_0,\ldots,v_{j-1},v_{j+1},\ldots,v_n]~ ) =0. &lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the boundary of the boundary of a chain is zero:  &lt;math&gt; \partial ^2 \rho =0 &lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, a simplex (and a chain) can be embedded into a [[manifold]] by means of smooth, differentiable map &lt;math&gt;f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, both the summation convention for denoting the set, and the boundary operation commute with the [[embedding]].  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;f(\sum\nolimits_i a_i \sigma_i) = \sum\nolimits_i a_i f(\sigma_i)&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are the integers denoting orientation and multiplicity.  For the boundary operator &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;, one has:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial f(\rho) = f (\partial \rho)&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is a chain. The boundary operation commutes with the mapping because, in the end, the chain is defined as a set and little more, and the set operation always commutes with the [[function (mathematics)|map operation]] (by definition of a map).

A continuous map &lt;math&gt;f:\sigma\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; to a [[topological space]] ''X'' is frequently referred to as a '''singular ''n''-simplex'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. (A map is generally called "singular" if it fails to have some desirable property such as continuity and, in this case, the term is meant to reflect to the fact that the continuous map need not be an embedding.)&lt;ref&gt;John M. Lee, ''Introduction to Topological Manifolds'', Springer, 2006, pp. 292–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algebraic geometry ==
Since classical algebraic geometry allows to talk about polynomial equations, but not inequalities, the ''algebraic standard n-simplex'' is commonly defined as the subset of affine (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional space, where all coordinates sum up to 1 (thus leaving out the inequality part). The algebraic description of this set is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^n := \left\{x \in \mathbb{A}^{n+1} ~\Big|~ \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} x_i - 1 = 0\right\},&lt;/math&gt;

which equals the [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]-theoretic description &lt;math&gt;\Delta_n(R) = \operatorname{Spec}(R[\Delta^n])&lt;/math&gt; with

:&lt;math&gt;R[\Delta^n] := R[x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}]\left/\left(\sum x_i -1\right)\right.&lt;/math&gt;

the ring of regular functions on the algebraic ''n''-simplex (for any ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;).

By using the same definitions as for the classical ''n''-simplex, the ''n''-simplices for different dimensions ''n'' assemble into one [[simplicial object]], while the rings &lt;math&gt;R[\Delta^n]&lt;/math&gt; assemble into one cosimplicial object &lt;math&gt;R[\Delta^\bullet]&lt;/math&gt; (in the category of schemes resp. rings, since the face and degeneracy maps are all polynomial).

The algebraic ''n''-simplices are used in higher [[K-theory]] and in the definition of higher [[Chow group]]s.

== Applications ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Simplices are used in plotting quantities that sum to 1, such as proportions of subpopulations, as in a [[ternary plot]].

In [[applied statistics#industrial|industrial statistics]], simplices arise in problem formulation and in algorithmic solution. In the design of bread, the producer must combine yeast, flour, water, sugar, etc. In such [[mixture]]s, only the relative proportions of ingredients matters: For an optimal bread mixture, if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled. Such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints, so that the nonnegative components sum to one, in which case the feasible region forms a simplex. The quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using [[response surface methodology]], and then a local maximum can be computed using a [[nonlinear programming]] method, such as [[sequential quadratic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[operations research]], [[linear programming]] problems can be solved by the [[simplex algorithm]] of [[George Dantzig]].

In [[geometric design]] and [[computer graphics]],  many methods first perform simplicial [[triangulation (topology)|triangulation]]s of the domain and then  [[interpolation|fit interpolating]] [[polynomial and rational function modeling|polynomials]] to each simplex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Vondran | first = Gary L. |date=April 1998 | title = Radial and Pruned Tetrahedral Interpolation Techniques | journal = HP Technical Report | volume = HPL-98-95 | pages = 1–32 | url = http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/98/HPL-98-95.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], the hydrides of most elements in the [[p-block]] can resemble a simplex if one is to connect each atom. [[Neon]] does not react with hydrogen and as such is [[Monatomic gas|a point]], [[fluorine]] bonds with one hydrogen atom and forms a line segment, [[oxygen]] bonds with two hydrogen in a [[Bent molecular geometry|bent]] fashion resembling a triangle, [[nitrogen]] reacts to form a [[Trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry|tetrahedron]], and [[carbon]] will form [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|a structure]] resembling a Schlegel diagram of the 5-cell. This trend continues for the heavier analogues of each element, as well as if the hydrogen is replaced by [[halogen]] atoms.

'''Social occultation''' occurs when a particular set of cultural [[values]] and [[beliefs]] combine with the operation of personal and [[mass media]] communication functions leads to ''lacunae'', or [[Blind spot (psychology)|blind spots]].

Intentional social occultation is the process of creating [[social invisibility]] while not completely denying the reality of a social circumstance, issue, or problem.  Social occultation is a dynamic of [[social constructionism]]. For example, the recent abuses by the USA military at [[Abu Ghraib]] prison in [[Iraq]] were made highly visible and resulted in shock and outrage in the USA. In contrast, the daily practices of humiliation and abuse in some prison settings in the USA get almost no public attention.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In various circumstances, certain social sub-groups and situations may have attention deflected away; this deflection may be institutionalized in [[media bias]].

As a dynamic of political or social [[Toleration|intolerance]], when segregation is not possible or desirable, social occultation may be found in individual [[behaviors]] and in organizational [[policies]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Outgroups]] have frequently sought visibility as a vehicle to address issues of concern.  For example, in 2004-2005 the incidence of violence to [[transgender]] people in Washington DC was a case where members of the outgroup considered public attention to be lacking.

Incidental neglect of an issue differs from deliberate posturing{{how?|date=April 2014}} (a [[Wiktionary:subversive|subversive]] process) to systematically ignore (in whole or part) the issue as a matter of political or social preference.

A '''social welfare model''' is a system of [[social welfare]] provision and its accompanying [[value system]]. It usually involves [[social policies]] that affect the welfare of a country's citizens within the framework of a market or mixed economy.

==Elements of a social welfare model==

===Taxation===
Taxation is concerned with how the state taxes the people, whether by a [[flat tax]], [[regressive tax]] or a [[progressive tax]] system. The most common guiding rule of taxation is to levy taxes by the ability to pay.

===Social insurance===
Social insurance is concerned with how the state implements [[social welfare|benefits]] for the unemployed, pensions, maternity and paternity leave and [[disabilities]].

===Public services===
Services such as [[health care]] can be almost entirely state funded, private [[insurance]]-based, or somewhere in-between. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] has an almost entirely publicly funded health service, the [[National Health Service]] (NHS), and [[Canada]] offers public health care offered at a [[province|provincial]] level. Conversely, in the [[United States]], individuals have to rely on health insurance policies in the event of hospitalization, and a minimal amount of state support for the poorer people exists. Another element can be [[public transport]], as some countries have nationalized rapid transit systems, while others have privatized them (in the UK for example, public transport has been privatised in [[Great Britain]] but not in [[Northern Ireland]]).

===Employment===
Economies with a more [[laissez-faire]] approach to employment will do nothing to provide job security. Other countries will rely on some degree of [[regulation]] to protect workers from arbitrary firings. A high degree of regulation such as expensive severance fees is often cited reason for making employers reluctant to hire and causing unemployment.

==Examples==

=== European welfare models ===
{{main|European social model}}

==== British Model====
Used by the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], and the [[South Asia|South Asian countries]] the British model tends to have a [[welfare state]] of roughly average size, relative to [[High income country|high-income]] [[OECD]] countries, but less comprehensive than those in [[Scandinavia]] and much of continental Europe. They have somewhat more poverty and higher inequality. Despite having a smaller welfare state than most Western European countries, the UK, Ireland and Canada do provide, among other things, universal single payer health care, redistribute income and guarantee an income at subsistence level.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Barr, N. (2004), ''Economics of the welfare state''. New York: Oxford University Press (USA).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Continental European ====
Used by [[Austria]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]], the Continental model has strict rules on job protection and a large amount of regulation in [[industry]]. However, the [[labour market]] has proven to be inflexible and slow to react to [[globalization]]. Generous insurance-based [[unemployment benefits]] and a well funded welfare state are used to reduce poverty and provide high quality health care. This model can generally be seen as middle ground between the British and Nordic models.

==== Mediterranean ====
Used by [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Portugal]], the [[Mediterranean]] model is similar to the Continental model, but focuses welfare on generous state-pensions. The labour market is inflexible with the same job protectionism as in the Continental model, but is not good at reducing poverty within the [[Working class|lower end]] of society.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==== The Nordic Model ====
The [[Scandinavian welfare model|Nordic Model]], mainly refers to Nordic countries  [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], [[Finland]] but some include the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;http://everything2.com/title/Nordic+model&lt;/ref&gt; also called 'Nordic corporatist' model because of strong influence of the [[corporatism|corporatist]] elements such as [[labor union]]s and [[employers' organization]]s, advocates a highly developed and government-funded welfare state which provides generous unemployment benefits among other resources for the general public. Labor markets are kept mobile with easy firing and hiring, and government taking care of those laid off with unemployment benefits and retraining. The equality of the Nordic model is achieved through progressive taxation. As a result of the policy, Sweden, Denmark and Norway have the lowest income disparities in the world. Nordic countries have been enjoying high economic and productivity growth, but most remarkably they consistently conquer top spots in [[Satisfaction with Life Index|world happiness surveys]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6360517.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-happiest-places-on-earth-are-heavily-taxed&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The United States of America ===
{{see also|American way of life}}
Before the Great Depression, the United States adhered to a social model that could be summarized by the term "rugged individualism": the understanding that because most people are capable of taking care of themselves, each person should be left to succeed or fail on their own, only fettered by the bounds of the law, and the government should be limited to protection of [[civil liberties]]. The United States had very little in the way of a [[social safety net]] for its citizens, with most people depending on their families and private social organizations if they were unable to provide for themselves; this partially explains the enduring greater emphasis on family and religion in American society and politics today than in other comparably developed countries in [[Western Europe]].

As a result of increased modernization in the late 19th century, this view changed in the emergence of the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive Movement]], which held that the government can and should have a greater role in regulating the economy, so as to promote a better life for all of its citizens. The biggest change came with President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], during which time the American government intervened extensively in the economy, guided often by [[Keynesian economics]]. New programs included relief for the poor, unemployed, and those who cannot work due to youth, old age, or disability.

However, since the [[Great Depression]], the United States has not followed other developed democracies in the establishment of a more comprehensive model for assuring its citizens' well being. One possible explanation for this is that the U.S was not affected in the same way by World War II as Europe was: while Europeans relied on strong centralized governments to help rebuild their economies after two world wars, the United States was enjoying a period of unprecedented economic growth due to its being one of the few industrialized countries on the planet whose productive capacity had not been destroyed by enemy nations. But now, with the rise of industrial and geo-political competition in Europe and Asia, growing income inequality, high energy prices, and mounting public debt, there is renewed debate over the role of government in modern society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21418">The word ‘dynamics’ appears frequently in discussions and writing about strategy, and is used in two distinct, though equally important senses.

The '''dynamics of strategy and performance''' concerns the ‘content’ of strategy – initiatives, choices, policies and decisions adopted in an attempt to improve performance, and the results that arise from these managerial behaviors.

The '''dynamic model of the strategy process''' is a way of understanding how strategic actions occur. It recognizes that [[strategic planning]] is dynamic, that is, strategy-making involves a complex pattern of actions and reactions. It is partially planned and partially unplanned.

A literature search shows the first of these senses to be both the earliest and most widely used meaning of ‘strategy dynamics’, though that is not to diminish the importance of the dynamic view of the strategy process.

== Static models of strategy and performance ==

The static assessment of strategy and performance, and its tools and frameworks dominate research, 
textbooks and practice in the field. They stem from a presumption dating back to before the 1980s that market and industry conditions determine how firms in a sector perform on average, and the scope for any firm to do better or worse than that average. E.g. the airline industry is notoriously unprofitable, but some firms are spectacularly profitable exceptions.

The ‘industry forces’ paradigm was established most firmly by [[Michael Porter]], (1980) in his seminal book ‘Competitive Strategy’, the ideas of which still form the basis of strategy analysis in many consulting firms and investment companies.
[[Richard Rumelt]] (1991) was amongst the first to challenge this presumption of the power of ‘industry forces’, and it has since become well understood that business factors are more important drivers of performance than are industry factors – in essence, this means you can do well in difficult industries, and struggle in industries where others do well. Although the relative importance of industry factors and firm-specific factors continues to be researched, the debate is now essentially over – management of strategy matters.

The increasing interest in how some businesses in an industry perform better than others led to the emergence of the ‘[[resource based view]]’ (RBV) of strategy ([[Birger Wernerfelt|Wernerfelt]], 1984;  Barney, 1991; [[Robert McQueen Grant|Grant]], 1991), which seeks to discover the firm-specific sources of superior performance – an interest that has increasingly come to dominate research.

== The need for a dynamic model of strategy and performance ==

The debate about the relative influence of industry and business factors on performance, and the RBV-based explanations for superior performance both, however, pass over a more serious problem. This concerns exactly what the ‘performance’ ''is'' that management seeks to improve. Would you prefer, for example, (A) to make $15m per year indefinitely, or (B) $12m this year, increasing by 20% a year, starting with the same resources?

Nearly half a century ago, [[Edith Penrose]] (1959) pointed out that superior profitability (e.g. return on sales or return on assets) was neither interesting to investors – who value the prospect of increasing future cash flows – nor sustainable over time. Profitability is not entirely unimportant – it does after all provide the investment in new resources to enable growth to occur. More recently, [[Rugman]] and [[Verbeke]] (2002) have reviewed the implications of this observation for research in strategy. [[Richard Rumelt]] (2007) has again raised the importance of making progress with the issue of strategy dynamics, describing it as still ‘the next frontier … underresearched, underwritten about, and underunderstood’.

The essential problem is that tools explaining why firm A performs better than firm B at a point in time are unlikely to explain why firm B is growing its performance more rapidly than firm A.

This is not just of theoretical concern, but matters to executives too – efforts by the management of firm B to match A’s profitability could well destroy its ability to grow profits, for example. A further practical problem is that many of the static frameworks do not provide sufficiently fine-grained guidance on strategy to help raise performance. For example, an investigation that identifies an attractive opportunity to serve a specific market segment with specific products or services, delivered in a particular way is unlikely to yield fundamentally different answers from one year to the next. Yet strategic management has much to do from month to month to ensure the business system develops strongly so as to take that opportunity quickly and safely.
What is needed, is a set of tools that explain how performance changes over time, and how to improve its future trajectory – i.e. a dynamic model of strategy and performance. 
&lt;!----------------------------------PICTURE------------------------------------&gt;
&lt;div style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:2.3em;text-align:center"&gt;[[Image:Why Where How performance over time.png|alt text {20}x{20}px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

==A possible dynamic model of strategy and performance==

To develop a dynamic model of strategy and performance requires components that explain how factors change over time. Most of the relationships on which business analysis are based describe relationships that are static and stable over time. For example, “profits = revenue minus costs”, or “market share = our sales divided by total market size” are relationships that are true. Static strategy tools seek to solve the strategy problem by extending this set of stable relationships, e.g. “profitability = some complex function of product development capability”.
Since a company’s sales clearly change over time, there must be something further back up the causal chain that makes this happen. One such item is ‘customers’ – if the firm has more customers now than last month, then (everything else being equal), it will have more sales and profits.

The number of ‘Customers’ at any time, however, cannot be calculated from anything else. It is one example of a factor with a unique characteristic, known as an ‘asset-stock’. This critical feature is that it accumulates over time, so “customers today = customers yesterday +/- customers won and lost”. This is not a theory or statistical observation, but is axiomatic of the way the world works. Other examples include cash (changed by cash-in and cash-out-flows), staff (changed by hiring and attrition), capacity, product range and dealers. Many intangible factors behave in the same way, e.g. reputation and staff skills.
Dierickx and Cool (1989) point out that this causes serious problems for explaining performance over time:
* ''Time compression diseconomies'' i.e. it takes time to accumulate resources.
* ''Asset Mass Efficiencies'' ‘the more you have, the faster you can get more’..
* ''Interconnectedness of Asset Stocks'' .. building one resource depends on other resources already in place.
* ''Asset erosion'' .. tangible and intangible assets alike deteriorate unless effort and expenditure are committed to maintaining them
* ''Causal ambiguity'' .. it can be hard to work out, even for the firm who owns a resource, why exactly it accumulates and depletes at the rate it does.

The consequences of these features is that relationships in a business system are highly non-linear. Statistical analysis will not, then, be able meaningfully to confirm any causal explanation for the number of customers at any moment in time. If that is true then statistical analysis also cannot say anything useful about any performance that depends on customers or on other accumulating asset-stocks – which is always the case.

Fortunately, a method known as [[system dynamics]] captures both the math of asset-stock accumulation (i.e. resource- and capability-building), and the interdependence between these components (Forrester, 1961; Sterman, 2000).
The asset-stocks relevant to strategy performance are resources [things we have] and capabilities [things we are good at doing]. This makes it possible to connect back to the resource-based view, though with one modification. RBV asserts that any resource which is clearly identifiable, and can easily be acquired or built, cannot be a source of competitive advantage, so only resources or capabilities that are valuable, rare, hard to imitate or buy, and embedded in the organization [the ‘VRIO’ criteria] can be relevant to explaining performance, for example reputation or product development capability. Yet day-to-day performance must reflect the simple, tangible resources such as customers, capacity and cash. VRIO resources may be important also, but it is not possible to trace a causal path from reputation or product development capability to performance outcomes without going via the tangible resources of customers and cash.

Warren (2002, 2007) brought together the specification of resources [tangible and intangible] and capabilities with the math of system dynamics to assemble a framework for strategy dynamics and performance with the following elements:
* Performance, ''P'', at time ''t'' is a function of the quantity of resources ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', discretionary management choices, ''M'', and exogenous factors, ''E'', at that time (Equation 1).
&lt;div
style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:2.3em;text-align:center"&gt;(1)	''P''(''t'') = f{''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')'', .. ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')'', ''M''(''t''), ''E''(''t'')} &lt;/div&gt;
* The current quantity of each resource ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' at time ''t'' is its level at time ''t-1'' plus or minus any resource-flows that have occurred between ''t-1'' and ''t'' (Equation 2).
&lt;div
style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:2.3em;text-align:center"&gt;(2)	''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'') = ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (''t-1'') +/- &lt;math&gt;\bigtriangleup&lt;/math&gt; ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t-1'' .. ''t'') &lt;/div&gt;
* The change in quantity of ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' between time ''t-1'' and time ''t'' is a function of the quantity of resources ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' at time ''t-1'', including that of resource ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' itself, on management choices, ''M'', and on exogenous factors ''E'' at that time (Equation 3).
&lt;div
style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:2.3em;text-align:center"&gt;(3)	&lt;math&gt;\bigtriangleup&lt;/math&gt; ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t-1'' .. ''t'') = f{''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t-1''), .. ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t-1''), ''M''(''t-1''), ''E''(''t-1'')} &lt;/div&gt;

This set of relationships gives rise to an ‘architecture’ that depicts, both graphically and mathematically, the core of how a business or other organization develops and performs over time. To this can be added other important extensions, including :
* the consequence of resources varying in one or more qualities or ‘attributes’ [e.g. customer size, staff experience]
* the development of resources through stages [disloyal and loyal customers, junior and senior staff]
* rivalry for any resource that may be contested [customers clearly, but also possibly staff and other factors]
* intangible factors [e.g. reputation, staff skills]
* capabilities [e.g. product development, selling]

== The Static Model of the Strategy Process ==

According to many introductory strategy textbooks, strategic thinking can be divided into two segments : strategy formulation and strategy implementation. Strategy formulation is done first, followed by implementation.

Strategy formulation involves:
# Doing a situation analysis: both internal and external; both micro-environmental and macro-environmental.
# Concurrent with this assessment, objectives are set. This involves crafting vision statements (long term), mission statements (medium term), overall corporate objectives (both financial and strategic), strategic business unit objectives (both financial and strategic), and tactical objectives.
#  These objectives should, in the light of the situation analysis, suggest a strategic plan. The plan provides the details of how to obtain these goals.
This three-step strategy formation process is sometimes referred to as determining where you are now, determining where you want to go, and then determining how to get there.

The next phase, according to this linear model is the implementation of the strategy. This involves:
* Allocation of sufficient resources (financial, personnel, time, computer system support)
* Establishing a chain of command or some alternative structure (such as [[cross-functional team]]s)
* Assigning responsibility of specific tasks or processes to specific individuals or groups
* Managing the process. This includes monitoring results, comparing to benchmarks and best practices, evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of the process, controlling for variances, and  making adjustments to the process as necessary.
* When implementing specific programs, this involves acquiring the requisite resources, developing the process, training, process testing, documentation, and integration with (and/or conversion from) legacy processes

==The Dynamic Model of the Strategy Process==

Several theorists have recognized a problem with this static model of the strategy process: it is not how strategy is developed in real life.  Strategy is actually a dynamic and interactive process. Some of the earliest challenges to the planned strategy approach came from [[Charles Lindblom|Linblom]] in the 1960s and [[James Brian Quinn|Quinn]] in the 1980s.

[[Charles Lindblom]] (1959) claimed that strategy is a fragmented process of serial and incremental decisions. He viewed strategy as an informal process of mutual adjustment with little apparent coordination.

[[James Brian Quinn]] (1978) developed an approach that he called "logical incrementalism". He claimed that strategic management involves guiding actions and events towards a conscious strategy in a step-by-step process. Managers nurture and promote strategies that are themselves changing. In regard to the nature of strategic management he says: "''Constantly integrating the simultaneous incremental process of strategy formulation and implementation is the central art of effective strategic management''." (page 145). Whereas Lindblom saw strategy as a disjointed process without conscious direction, Quinn saw the process as fluid but controllable.

Joseph Bower (1970) and [[Robert Burgelman]] (1980) took this one step further. Not only are strategic decisions made incrementally rather than as part of a grand unified vision, but according to them, this multitude of small decisions are made by numerous people in all sections and levels of the organization.

[[Henry Mintzberg]] (1978) made a distinction between deliberate strategy and emergent strategy. Emergent strategy originates not in the mind of the strategist, but in the interaction of the organization with its environment. He claims that emergent strategies tend to exhibit a type of convergence in which ideas and actions from multiple sources integrate into a pattern. This is a form of [[organizational learning]], in fact, on this view, organizational learning is one of the core functions of any business enterprise (See [[Peter Senge]]'s ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'' (1990).)

[[Constantinos Markides]] (1999) describes strategy formation and implementation as an ongoing, never-ending, integrated process requiring continuous reassessment and [[reform]]ation.

A particularly insightful model of strategy process dynamics comes from [[J. Moncrieff]] (1999). He recognized that strategy is partially deliberate and partially unplanned, though whether the resulting performance is better for being planned or not is unclear. The unplanned element comes from two sources : “emergent strategies” result from the emergence of opportunities and threats in the environment and “Strategies in action” are ad hoc actions by many people from all parts of the organization. These multitudes of small actions are typically not intentional, not teleological, not formal, and not even recognized as strategic. They are emergent from within the organization, in much the same way as “emergent strategies” are emergent from the environment. However, it is again not clear whether, or under what circumstances, strategies would be better if more planned.

In this model, strategy is both planned and emergent, dynamic, and interactive. Five general processes interact. They are strategic intention, the organization's response to emergent environmental issues, the dynamics of the actions of individuals within the organization, the alignment of action with strategic intent, and strategic learning.

The alignment of action with strategic intent (the top line in the diagram), is the blending of strategic intent, emergent strategies, and strategies in action, to produce strategic outcomes. The continuous monitoring of these strategic outcomes produces strategic learning (the bottom line in the diagram). This learning comprises feedback into internal processes, the environment, and strategic intentions.  Thus the complete system amounts to a triad of continuously self-regulating feedback loops. Actually, quasi self-regulating is a more appropriate term since the feedback loops can be ignored by the organization. The system is self-adjusting only to the extent that the organization is prepared to learn from the strategic outcomes it creates. This requires effective leadership and an agile, questioning, corporate culture. In this model, the distinction between strategy formation and strategy implementation disappears.

==Criticisms of Dynamic Strategy Process Models==

Some detractors claim that these models are too complex to teach. No one will understand the model until they see it in action. Accordingly, the two part linear categorization scheme is probably more valuable in textbooks and lectures.

Also, there are some implementation decisions that do not fit a dynamic model. They include specific project implementations. In these cases implementation is exclusively tactical and often routinized. Strategic intent and dynamic interactions influence the decision only indirectly.

&amp; \simeq F^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d} \\
&amp; \simeq F^{n_{\pi_1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_{\pi_d}} \\
&amp; \simeq F^{n_{\pi_1} n_{\pi_2}} \otimes F^{n_{\pi_3}} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_{\pi_d}} \\
&amp; \simeq F^{n_{\pi_1} n_{\pi_3}} \otimes F^{n_{\pi_2}} \otimes F^{n_{\pi_4}} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_{\pi_d}} \\
&amp; \,\,\,\vdots \\
&amp; \simeq F^{n_1 n_2 \ldots n_d},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\pi \in \mathfrak{S}_d&lt;/math&gt; is any permutation.

Via these (and other) isomorphisms, a tensor can be interpreted in several ways as an order-''k'' tensor with &lt;math&gt;k &lt; d&lt;/math&gt;. Let

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
\Pi_S : V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d &amp;\to V_{s_1} \otimes V_{s_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes V_{s_{|S|}} \\
v_1 \otimes v_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_d &amp;\mapsto v_{s_1} \otimes v_{s_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes v_{s_{|S|}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

denote the projection with &lt;math&gt;
S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k\} \subset [1,d]&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;
S_1 \sqcup S_2 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup S_\ell = [1,d]&lt;/math&gt; be a partition. Then, the &lt;math&gt; (S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_\ell)&lt;/math&gt;-flattening of a simple tensor &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A} = v_1 \otimes v_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_d&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}_{(S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_\ell)} := {} &amp; (\Pi_{S_1}\mathcal{A}) \otimes (\Pi_{S_2} \mathcal{A}) \otimes \cdots \otimes (\Pi_{S_\ell}\mathcal{A}) \\[4pt]
&amp; \in \left( \bigotimes_{s \in S_1} V_s \right) \otimes \cdots \otimes \left( \bigotimes_{s \in S_\ell} V_s \right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which may be interpreted as a tensor of order &lt;math&gt;
\ell &lt; d&lt;/math&gt; by ignoring the tensor product structure on &lt;math&gt;
\otimes_{s \in S_k} V_s&lt;/math&gt;. The standard way to ignore the tensor product structure consists of looking at &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A}_{(S_1,\ldots,S_\ell)}&lt;/math&gt; through an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;
\otimes_{s\in S_k} V_s \simeq F^{\prod_{s\in S_k} n_s}&lt;/math&gt;, in which case &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A}_{(S_1,\ldots,S_\ell)}&lt;/math&gt; is viewed as an element of &lt;math&gt;
F^{N_{S_1}} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{N_{S_\ell}}&lt;/math&gt;, where

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;
N_{S_k} := \prod_{s \in S_k} n_s&lt;/math&gt;.

For general tensors &lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{A} \in V_1 \otimes V_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_d&lt;/math&gt; the above definition is extended linearly as follows. Since every tensor admits a [[tensor rank decomposition]], we can define the &lt;math&gt;
(S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_\ell)&lt;/math&gt;-flattening of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;
\mathcal{A} = \sum_{i=1}^r \mathbf{a}_i^1 \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^d&lt;/math&gt;

as follows:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;
\mathcal{A}_{(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_\ell)} := \sum_{i=1}^r \left( \mathbf{a}_i^1 \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^d \right)_{(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_\ell)}. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===
For example, assume that a basis of &lt;math&gt;V_k&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{ v_1^k, v_2^k, \ldots, v_{n_k}^k \}&lt;/math&gt; and that the tensor is expressed with respect to this basis as &lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathcal{A} = \sum_{j_1, j_2, \ldots, j_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} v_{j_1}^1 \otimes v_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_{j_d}^{d}.&lt;/math&gt;Via the first isomorphism, we can represent &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathcal{A} = \sum_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} a_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_2}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d,&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{j}^k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''th standard basis vector of &lt;math&gt;F^{n_k}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking &lt;math&gt;
S_1 = [1,d]&lt;/math&gt; and a bijective map &lt;math&gt;
\mu : [1,n_1] \times \cdots \times [1,n_d] \to [1,n_1\cdots n_d] &lt;/math&gt;, we can construct an isomorphism between &lt;math&gt;
F^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
F^{n_1 \cdots n_d} &lt;/math&gt; by mapping &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{e}_{j_1}^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{e}_{j_d}^d \mapsto \mathbf{e}_{\mu(j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_d)}, &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{e}_j &lt;/math&gt; is the ''j''th standard basis vector of &lt;math&gt;
F^{n_1 \cdots n_d} &lt;/math&gt;. Via this identification, we have &lt;math&gt;
A_{(S_1)} = [ a_{\mu^{-1}(i)} ]_{i=1}^{n_1 \cdots n_d} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Vectorization ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in F^{n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d}&lt;/math&gt; be the coordinate representation of an abstract tensor with respect to a basis.
A '''vectorization''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;
(S_1)&lt;/math&gt;-reshaping wherein &lt;math&gt;
S_1 = [1,d]&lt;/math&gt;, so that the tensor is simply interpreted as a vector in &lt;math&gt;
F^{n_1 \cdots n_d}&lt;/math&gt;. A standard choice of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is such that 

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{vec}(\mathcal{A}) := \mathcal{A}_{(S_1)} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{1,1,\ldots,1} &amp; a_{2,1,\ldots,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{n_1,1,\ldots,1} &amp; a_{1,2,1,\ldots,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_d} \end{bmatrix}^T,&lt;/math&gt;

which is consistent with the way in which the colon operator in [[Matlab]] and [[GNU Octave]] reshapes a higher-order tensor into a vector.

== Flattenings == 
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in F^{n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d}&lt;/math&gt; be the coordinate representation of an abstract tensor with respect to a basis.
A '''standard factor-''k'' flattening''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;
(S_1, S_2)&lt;/math&gt;-reshaping in which &lt;math&gt;
S_1 = \{k\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
S_2 = [1,d] \smallsetminus S_1&lt;/math&gt;. Usually, a standard flattening is denoted by 

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_{(k)} := \mathcal{A}_{(S_1,S_2)} &lt;/math&gt;

These reshapings are sometimes called '''matricizations''' or '''unfoldings''' in the literature. A standard choice of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the one that is consistent with the reshape function in [[Matlab]] and [[GNU Octave]], namely

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_{(k)} := \begin{bmatrix} 
a_{1,1,\ldots,1,1,1,\ldots,1} &amp; a_{2,1,\ldots,1,1,1,\ldots,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_{k-1},1,n_{k+1},\ldots,n_d} \\
a_{1,1,\ldots,1,2,1,\ldots,1} &amp; a_{2,1,\ldots,1,2,1,\ldots,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_{k-1},2,n_{k+1},\ldots,n_d} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
a_{1,1,\ldots,1,n_k,1,\ldots,1} &amp; a_{2,1,\ldots,1,n_k,1,\ldots,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_{k-1},n_k,n_{k+1},\ldots,n_d}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Transposed Letter Effect''', in psychology, tests any effect on how a word is processed when two letters within the word are switched.

The phenomenon takes place when two letters in a word (typically called a base word) switch positions to create a new string of letters that form a new, [[non-word]] (typically called a transposed letter non-word or TL non-word). It is a form of [[priming (psychology)]] because the transposed letter non-word is able to activate the lexical representation of its base word. A non-word that is created by transposing letters in a base word is significantly more effective at being a prime for that base word than would be a prime created by exchanging letters from the base word with random letters that were not originally in the base word. For example, the TL non-word 'stduent' would be a more effective prime than would be the non-word 'stobent' for the base word student.

Priming is an effect of [[implicit memory]] where exposure to a certain stimulus, event, or experience affects responding to a different stimulus. Typically, the event causes the stimulus to become more salient. The transposed letter effect can be used as a form of priming.

==Relevance==
With any priming task the purpose is to test the initial stages of processing in order to better understand more complex processing. Psychologists use transposed-letter priming to test how people comprehend word meanings. From these findings, people can begin to understand how people learn, develop and understand language. Transposed-letter priming is used in a wide array of experiments and the reasons for using this method can depend on the particular hypothesis.

==Types==

===Close Transpositions===
Switching the position of adjacent letters in the base word is a close [[wikt:transposition|transposition]]. This type of transposition creates the greatest priming effect. For example, an effective prime for the word "computer" would be the TL non-word "comptuer".

===Distant Transpositions===
Forming a prime word by switching the position of nonadjacent letters in the base word is a distant transposition. There is significantly less priming effect in a distant transposition than a close transposition, no matter how distant the two letters are from each other.

==History==
The first study to test the transposed-letter effects was Burner and O’Dowd (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bruner, J. S. &amp; O’Dowd, D.|year=1958|title=A note on the informativeness of parts of words|journal=Language and Speech|volume=1|pages=98–101|doi=10.1177/002383095800100203}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their experiment did not use priming. They showed participants a word that had a two letter switched either at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the word and they had to determine what the English word was. They measured their response time. Bruner and O’Dowd found that the error at the beginning created the slowest response time, the end was the next slowest and the middle was the fastest. The conclusion to this data was that the beginning and the end were more important for word recognition than the middle. From there, the transposition letter effect was used to test how people process and recognize words using many tasks.

==Transposed Letter Effect in Baboons==
A study by Ziegler et al. (2013) demonstrated that baboons also show similar effects in regards to the transposed letter effect as humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ziegler J. C., Hannagan T., Dufau S., Montant M., Fagot J., Grainger J. | year = 2013 | title = Transposed-letter effects reveal orthographic processing in baboons | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 24 | issue = 8| pages = 1609–1611 | doi=10.1177/0956797612474322}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the study was to find evidence to suggest that baboons use orthographic processing when reading. Previous research has considered transposed letter effects as strong evidence for orthographic processing (Grainger, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Graigner J. (2008). Cracking the orthographic code: An introduction. Language and Cognitive Processing, 23(1), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Baboons were asked to classify strings of letters as either words or non-words by selecting certain shapes (for example, a circle for a word and a square for a non-word). The baboons were shown words they had previously learned and non-words. The non-words were created by using four-letter words, previously learned by the baboons, and either transposing the two middle letters or replacing the two middle letters with different letters (double substitute non-words). Baboons classified TL non-words as words significantly more often than double substitute non-words.

==Theories Effected by Transposed-Letter Priming Effects==

===Theories challenged by effects of transposed-letter priming===
There are a number of theories that have been challenged by the effects shown with transposition-letter priming. These theories mainly have to do with how letters are used to process words.

Slot-based coding theory states that each letter in a word is connected to a particular location, or slot, within that word. One of the major theories that predict letter slots is the interactive activation model created by [[James McClelland (psychologist)|McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] (1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McClelland J. L., Rumelhart D. E. | year = 1981 | title = An interactive activation model of context effects in letter perception: Part 1. an account of basic findings | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 88 | issue = 5| pages = 375–407 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.88.5.375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model assumes that people are letter-position specific when detecting words, so our recognition of words is based on what letters it contains, where the letters are placed within that word and the length of the word itself. Another example is the bayesian reader model created by Norris (2006) which also assumes that the letters in a word are associated with their specific location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Norris, D.|year=2006|title=The bayesian reader: Explaining word recognition as an optimal bayesian decision process|journal=Psychological Review|volume=113|issue=2|pages=327–357|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.113.2.327|pmid=16637764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many experiments (for example, Perea and Lupker, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Perea, M. &amp; Lupker, S. J., (2003). Transposed-letter confusability effects in masked form priming. In Kinoshita, S. &amp; Lupker, S. J., (Eds.) Masked Priming: The State of the Art (97-120). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown if you use transposed-letter priming, (for example, priming judge with jugde) you will see a priming effect but if the prime is a word where two letters are changed to other letter (for example, priming judge with jupfe) there is no priming effect. According to the two models discussed we would assume jugde is no more similar to judge than jupfe because the letters are not in the correct slots. In another experiment, TL non-words were more likely to be (incorrectly) classified as actual words than are nonsense control words (Andrews, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrews S | year = 1996 | title = Lexical retrieval and selection processes: Effects of transposed-letter confusability | url = | journal = Journal of Memory and Language | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 775–800 | doi=10.1006/jmla.1996.0040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew’s results are also inconsistent with the many slot-based coding models because even with two of the letters in the incorrect spot they read the word as if spelled correctly.

The parallel distributed processing model proposed by Seidenberg and McClelland (1989) also uses a portion of words but instead of letters they are a small group of letters in the same order as in the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seidenberg M. S., McClelland J. L. | year = 1989 | title = A distributed, developmental model of word recognition and naming (English) | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 96 | issue = 4| pages = 523–568 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.96.4.523 | pmid=2798649}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the word “judge” would have these groupings: _ju, jud, udg, dge, ge_. This predicts that if part of two words match there will be some priming, but this model still depends on the position of the letters to some extent, so it is not compatible with results from transposed-letter priming.

===Theories supported by effect of transposed-letter priming===
There are a number of theories that are supported by the results shown by the transposed-letter effect.

The SERIOL model (sequential encoding regulated by inputs to oscillations within letter units) described by Whitney (2001) explains processing of words as five levels, or nodes: retinal level, feature level, letter level, bigram level and word level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Whitney C | year = 2001 | title = How the brain encodes the order of letters in a printed word: The SERIOL model and selective literature review | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 221–243 | doi=10.3758/bf03196158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the bigram level, the letters detected are turned into a number of pairs. For example, the word “cart” has the bigrams ca, ar, rt, ar, at and ct. The bigrams that more closely represent the location of letters in the words are given more weight. The pairs are then used to form the word. Within this model, letter location is still a factor but is not a defining feature of word processing, so the transposed-letter effect is consistent with this model.

In the SOLAR model (self-organizing lexical acquisition and recognition) described by Davis (1999) each letter is associated with its own level of activation.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, C. J. (1999). The self-organising lexical acquisition and recognition (SOLAR) model of visual word recognition (Doctoral dissertation). University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; The first letter in the word has the highest level of activation and so on until the last word has the lowest level of activation. In this model, position does describe the level of activation for that particular letter but because the activation is successive, two letters beside each other would have a similar activation level. The SOLAR model is consistent with the results of the transposed-letter effect priming because with this effect experiments have shown priming when two adjacent letters are switched but not when two letters farther apart in the word are switched.

Transposed-letter priming was used by Christianson, Johnson and Rayner (2005) on compound words to test the role of morphemes in word processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Christianson K., Johnson R. L., Rayner K. | year = 2005 | title = Letter transpositions within and across morphemes (English) | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 1327–1339 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.31.6.1327}}&lt;/ref&gt; They switched the letters either within the morphemes (for example, snowball to snowblal) or between morphemes (for example, snowball to snobwall) in the primes and found a greater priming effect within the morphemes than between. This supported the theory that morphemes are used during the processing of compound words because the priming effect was only reduced when the letters were switched over the morpheme boundary and were unable to separate into their separate parts.

'''View''' or '''position''' ([[Pali]] ''{{IAST|diṭṭhi}}'', [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|dṛṣṭi}}'') is a central idea in [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Fuller|2005|page=1}} In Buddhist thought, a view is not a simple, abstract collection of propositions, but a charged interpretation of experience which intensely shapes and affects thought, sensation, and action.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus 2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan|last=Lusthaus|title=Buddhist Phenomenology|url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/buddhist_phenomenology_-_a_pholosophical_investigation_of_yogacara_buddhism_and_the_cheng_wei-shih_lun.pdf|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=242, n. 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having the proper mental attitude toward views is therefore considered an integral part of the Buddhist path, as sometimes correct views need to put into practice and incorrect views abandoned, and sometimes all views are seen as obstacles to enlightenment.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|pages=1–2}}

== Positions ==
[[File:Jungle Landscape.jpg|alt=jungle in India|thumb|255x255px|In describing the highly diverse intellectual landscape of his day, the Buddha is said to have referred to "the wrangling of views, the jungle of views".&lt;ref name="Harvey 2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Harvey|title=Buddhist Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NoLAHXt4PRMC|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2000|pages=239–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Views are produced by and in turn produce [[sankhara|mental conditioning]]. They are symptoms of conditioning, rather than neutral alternatives individuals can dispassionately choose.&lt;ref name="Lusthaus 2002" /&gt; The Buddha, according to [[Pali Canon|early texts]], having attained the state of [[Nibbana|unconditioned mind]], is said to have "passed beyond the bondage, tie, greed, obsession, acceptance, attachment, and lust of view."{{sfn|Fuller|2005|page=2}}

Those who wish to experience [[nirvana]] must free themselves from everything binding them to the world, including philosophical and religious doctrines.&lt;ref name="Skirbekk 2001"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Gunnar|last1=Skirbekk|first2=Nils|last2=Gilje|title=A history of Western thought: from ancient Greece to the twentieth century|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=NoLAHXt4PRMC|edition=7th|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2001|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right view|Right view]] as the first part of the Noble Eightfold Path leads ultimately not to the holding of correct views, but to a detached form of cognition.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|page=2}}

== Understanding karma ==
{{See also|Noble Eightfold Path}}
The term "right view" (''{{IAST|samyak-dṛuṣṭi}}'' / ''{{IAST|sammā-diṭṭhi}}'') or "right understanding" is basically about having a correct attitude towards one's social and religious duties. This is explained from the perspective of the system of [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] and the [[samsara|cycle of rebirth]].{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=88}} Used in an ethical context, it entails that our actions have consequences, that death is not the end, that our actions and beliefs also have consequences after death, and that the Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and [[Buddhist cosmology|the other world]] (heaven and underworld or hell).{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=12; 77-79}}{{sfn|Velez de Cea|2013|p=54}}{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=88}} Originating in the pre-Buddhist [[Brahmanical]] concerns with [[yajna|sacrifice rituals]] and [[Asceticism#Hinduism|asceticism]], in early texts the Buddha shifts the emphasis to a karmic perspective, which includes the entire religious life. The Buddha further describes such right view as beneficial, because whether these views are true or not, people acting on them (e.i. leading a good life) will be praised by the wise.{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=88}} They will also act in a correct way. If the views do turn out to be true, and there is a next world after death, such people will experience the good karma of what they have done when they were still alive. This is not to say that the Buddha is described as uncertain about right view: he, as well as other accomplished spiritual masters, are depicted as having "seen" these views by themselves as reality.&lt;!--p=88--&gt; Although devotees may not be able to see these truths for themselves yet, they are expected to develop a "pro-attitude" towards them.&lt;!--p=89--&gt;{{sfn|Collins|1990|pp=88–9}} Moral right view is not just considered to be adopted, however. Rather, the practitioner endeavors to live following right view, such practice will reflect on the practitioner, and will eventually lead to deeper insight into and wisdom about reality.{{sfn|Fuller|2005|p=41}}

According to Indologist Tilmann Vetter, right view came to explicitly include karma and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|Rebirth]], and the importance of the [[Four Noble Truths]], when "insight" became central to Buddhist [[soteriology]].{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=77}} This presentation of right view still plays an essential role in Theravada Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Harvey 2000" /&gt;

== Understanding doctrine ==
A second meaning of right view is an initial understanding of points of doctrine such as the [[Four Noble Truths]], [[anatman|not-self]] and [[Dependent Origination]],&lt;!--pp=89-90--&gt; combined with the intention to accept those teachings and apply them to oneself.&lt;!--pp=92, 95--&gt; Thirdly, a "supramundane" right view is also distinguished, which refers to a more refined, intuitive understanding produced by meditative practice. Thus, a gradual path of self-development is described, in which the meaning of right view gradually develops.&lt;!--pp=91-2--&gt; In the beginning, right view can only lead to a good rebirth, but at the highest level, right view can help the practitioner to attain to liberation from the cycle of existence.&lt;!--p=120--&gt;{{sfn|Collins|1990|pp=89–92, 95, 120}}

Buddhist Studies scholar Paul Fuller believes that although there are differences between the different levels of right view, all levels aim for emotional detachment. The wisdom of right view at the moral level leads to see the world without [[lobha|greed]], [[Dvesha|hatred]] and [[moha (Buddhism)|delusion]].{{sfn|Fuller|2005|p=42}}

Misunderstanding objects as self is not only seen as a form of wrong view, but also as a manifestation of desire, requiring a change in character.{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=119}}

== No views ==
The Buddha of the [[early Buddhism|early discourses]] often refers to the negative effect of attachment to speculative or fixed views, dogmatic opinions, or even correct views if not known to be true by personal verification. In describing the highly diverse intellectual landscape of his day, he is said to have referred to "the wrangling of views, the jungle of views".&lt;ref name="Harvey 2000" /&gt; He assumed an unsympathetic attitude toward speculative and religious thought in general.&lt;ref name="Skirbekk 2001"/&gt; In a set of poems in the early text [[Sutta Nipata]], the Buddha states that he himself has no viewpoint. According to Steven Collins, these poems distill the style of teaching that was concerned less with the content of views and theories than with the psychological states of those who hold them.{{sfn|Collins|1990|p=129}}{{elucidate|date=December 2017}}

{{More citations needed|date =January 2009}}

'''Visual thinking''', also called '''visual/spatial learning''' or '''picture thinking''' is the phenomenon of thinking through [[visual processing]].{{sfn|Deza|2009|p=526}}

Visual thinking has been described as seeing words as a series of pictures.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} It is common in approximately 60–65% of the general population.{{sfn|Deza|2009|p=526}}

"Real picture thinkers", those who use visual thinking almost to the exclusion of other kinds of thinking, make up a smaller percentage of the population. Research by child development theorist Linda Kreger Silverman suggests that less than 30% of the population strongly uses visual/spatial thinking, another 45% uses both visual/spatial thinking and thinking in the form of words, and 25% thinks exclusively in words. According to Kreger Silverman, of the 30% of the general population who use visual/spatial thinking, only a small percentage would use this style over and above all other forms of thinking, and can be said to be true "picture thinkers".{{sfn|Silverman|2005}}

==Research and theoretical background==
The Dutch [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|nonprofit organization]] the "Maria J. Krabbe Stichting Beelddenken" conducts research on "beelddenken". The "Maria J. Krabbe Stichting" has developed a test, named the "Ojemann wereldspel", to identify children who rely primarily on visual-spatial thinking. In this test, children are asked to build a village with toy houses and then replicate it a few days later. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boekinbeeld.be/beeldenken-signaleren.htm Signaleren van beelddenken bij kinderen met het ojemann wereldspel]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], there is a strong and growing interest in the phenomenon of 'true' "picture thinking", or "beelddenken".{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} As a result of increased media coverage during the last few years, there is an acceptance of its existence by the general public,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} despite criticism from Dutch psychologists and development theorists, principally N. van Woerden and R. Wiers.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Several websites and foundations are dedicated to "beelddenken".&lt;ref&gt;[http://beelddenken.startpagina.nl/ Startpagina "beelddenken"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stichtingbeelddenken.nl/ Stichting beelddenken ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-verbal thought==
{{See also|Cognitive psychology|Cognitive science|Nonverbal communication|}}
	
Thinking in mental images is one of a number of other recognized forms of non-verbal thought, such as [[Kinesthetic learning|kinesthetic]], musical and mathematical thinking.

===Linguistics===
{{Main|Linguistics}}

A common assumption is that people think in language, and that language and thought influence each other.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Linguistics]] studies how language is used and acquired.

The strong version of the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] in [[linguistics]] states that language determines thought, and that linguistic categories alone limit and determine cognitive categories. Although Whorf himself framed linguistic relativity in terms of "habits of mind" rather than determinism, the revolutionary nature of his hypothesis was met with much misinterpretation and criticism. In 1969, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay rejected the strong hypothesis using a [[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution|color terminology study]].{{sfn|Berlin|1969}}

[[Steven Pinker]] notes that we are not born with language, so that it is not likely that we are engineered to think in words alone.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, ''The Language Instinct''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple intelligences===
{{Main|Theory of multiple intelligences}}

Gardner's multiple intelligences theory recognises various forms of intelligence, namely spatial, linguistic, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denig|first=S. J.|date=2004|title=Multiple Intelligences and learning styles: Two complementary dimensions|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.614.828&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=Teachers College Record|volume=106|pages=96–111|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9620.2004.00322.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's theory is discussed and cited in many of David A Sousa's 'How the Brain learns' series of books, including 'How the Gifted Brain learns' and 'How the Special Needs Brain Learns'.  Areas of competence may be reinforcing, but also mutually exclusive. In today's society the link between IQ and education has weakened, but the idea of educated and intelligent has become synonymous, interchangeable; reinforced by verbalizers being better able to internalize information, advocate systems and design jobs that monetarily reward strengths, a cycle that is self-perpetuating.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Split-brain research===
{{Main|Split-brain}}

According to [[Roger Sperry]] the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere perform different tasks. The left and right hemisphere may be simultaneously conscious in different, even mutually conflicting, mental experiences that run in parallel. The right [non-verbal] hemisphere perceives, thinks, remembers, reasons, wills and emotes, all at a characteristically human level.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Research which builds on Sperry's split brain research is reinforced by [[anecdotal evidence]], which supports the premise that different architectures lend themselves to one of the channels, at the expense of the others.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Spatial-temporal reasoning and spatial visualization ability===
{{Main|Spatial–temporal reasoning|Spatial visualization ability}}

Spatial-temporal reasoning is the ability to visualize special patterns and mentally manipulate them over a time-ordered sequence of spatial transformations.{{sfn|Deza|2009|p=526}} Spatial visualization ability is the ability to manipulate mentally two- and three-dimensional figures.{{sfn|Deza|2009|p=526}}

Spatial-temporal reasoning is prominent among visual thinkers as well as among [[Kinesthetic learning|kinesthetic learners]] (those who learn through movement, physical patterning and doing) and logical thinkers (mathematical thinkers who think in patterns and systems) who may not be strong visual thinkers at all.{{sfn|Deza|2009|p=526}}

===Photographic memory===
{{Main|Eidetic memory}}

[[Eidetic memory]] (photographic memory) may co-occur in visual thinkers as much as in any type of thinking style as it is a memory function associated with having vision rather than a thinking style.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Eidetic memory can still occur in those with visual [[agnosia]], who, unlike visual thinkers, may be limited in the use of visualization skills for mental reasoning.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Psychologist E.R Jaensch states that eidetic memory apart of visual thinking has to do with eidetic images fading between the line of the after image and the memory image.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} A fine relationship may exist between the after image and the memory image, which causes visual thinkers from not seeing the eidetic image but rather drawing upon perception and useful information.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Individuals diagnosed with agnosia, may not be able to perform mental reasoning.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Learning styles===
{{Main|Learning styles}}

The acknowledgement and application of different cognitive and [[learning styles]], including visual, kinesthetic, musical, mathematical and verbal thinking styles, are a common part of many current teacher training courses.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Those who think in pictures have generally claimed to be best at visual learning.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Empirical research shows that there is no evidence that identifying a student's "learning style" produces better outcomes. There is significant evidence that the widespread "meshing hypothesis", the assumption that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student's learning style, is invalid.{{sfn|Pashler|2008}}{{sfn|Felder|2007}} Well-designed studies "flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis".{{sfn|Pashler|2008}}
{{Disputed inline|Adapting_to_learning_style_produces_no_better_outcomes_--_contradictory|date=April 2017}}

== Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) in teaching==
VTS allows teachers to teach reading with the use of complex visuals, rather than the print and individual text forms used in the past.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cappello|first=Marva|last2=Walker|first2=Nancy T.|date=2016-11-01|title=Visual Thinking Strategies: Teachers' Reflections on Closely Reading Complex Visual Texts Within the Disciplines|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/trtr.1523/abstract|journal=The Reading Teacher|language=en|volume=70|issue=3|pages=317–325|doi=10.1002/trtr.1523|issn=1936-2714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concurrency with dyslexia and autism==

===Dyslexia===
{{Main|Dyslexia}}

Research suggests that dyslexia is a symptom of a predominant visual/spatial learning.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (1896), Hinselwood (1900), Orton (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan used the term 'word blindness,' in 1896. Hinselwood expanded on 'word blindness' to describe the reversing of letters and similar phenomena in the 1900s.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Orton suggested that individuals have difficulty associating the visual with the verbal form of words, in 1925.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further studies, using technologies (PET and MRI), and wider and varied user groups in various languages, support the earlier findings.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Visual-spatial symptoms ([[dyslexia]], [[developmental coordination disorder]], [[Auditory processing disorder|auditory processing disorder (APD)]] and the like) arise in non-visual and non-spatial environments and situations; hence, visual/spatial learning is aggravated by an [[education system]] based upon information presented in [[written text]] instead of presented via [[multimedia]] and [[Hands-on learning|hands-on experience]].

===Autism===
{{See also|Autism|Nonverbal learning disorder}}

Visual thinking has been argued by [[Temple Grandin]] to be an origin for delayed speech in people with [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandin.com/inc/visual.thinking.html THINKING IN PICTURES: Autism and Visual Thought&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that visual thinking has some necessary connection with autism.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Functional imaging studies on people with autism have supported the hypothesis that they have a cognitive style that favors the use of visuospatial coding strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahyoun|first=Chérif P.|author2=John W. Belliveau |author3=Isabelle Soulières |author4=Shira Schwartz |author5=Maria Mody |title= Neuroimaging of the Functional and Structural Networks Underlying Visuospatial versus Linguistic Reasoning in High-Functioning Autism|url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2795068/pdf/nihms-147125.pdf|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2010|volume=48|pages=86–95|doi= 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.08.013|accessdate=10 March 2013 |pmc=2795068 |pmid=19698726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and design education==
Concepts related to visual thinking have played an important role in art and design education over the past several decades, but this has not always been the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpi.state.wi.us/standards/pdf/art&amp;design.pdf Wisconsin’s Model Academic Standards for Art and Design Education]&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Greece, Plato tended to place an emphasis on music to aid cognition in the education of heroes because of its mathematical tendencies and "harmonies of the cosmos". On the other hand, visual images, paintings in particular, caused the reliances on "illusionary images"&lt;ref name="Arnheim 1969"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnheim|first=Rudolf|title=Visual Thinking|year=1969|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520018710}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the Western world, children begin primary school with abstract thought and shapes, but as we grow older, according to Rudolf Arnheim, "arts are reduced to a desirable supplement"&lt;ref name="Arnheim 1969"/&gt; The general world trend in the late twentieth century caused an emphases towards scientific, mathematical, and quantitative approach to education, and art education is often refuted because it is based on perception. It is qualitative and subjective which makes it difficult to measure and evaluate.

However, fundamentals in visual thinking lay the ground work for many design disciplines such as art and architecture. Two of the most influential aspects of visual composition in these disciplines are patterns and color. Patterns are not only prevalent in many different aspects of everyday life, but it is also telling about our interpretation of the world. In addition, there are now studied approaches to how color should be used in design where "the functional aesthetics of colour can be reduced to a small number of guidelines and lists the main properties needed to make design decisions leading to visual clarity".&lt;ref name= Ware&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Colin|title=Visual thinking for design|year=2008|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=Burlington, Mass.|isbn=978-0123708960|edition=[Repr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, techniques in art and design can open up pathways to stimulate the thought process and problem solving. Sketches offer an unrestrained way to get thoughts down on paper through the "abstract representations of ideas and idea structures".&lt;ref name= Ware/&gt;  In this way, sketching not only helps to generate ideas, but also to reflect and edit them as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tovey, M.|first=Porter, S.|last2=Newman, R.|date=March 2003|title=Sketching, concept development and automotive design|url=|journal=Design Studies|volume=24 |issue=2|pages=135–153|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an effective means of communication, especially for architects and engineers, for translating ideas from designer to client. Despite all the advantages of integrating art and visuals into education, it is a difficult skill to master. Those who can are well versed in visual analysis. It takes a lot of practice to have sketches evolve from "meaningless scribbles" to a complex "thinking tool".&lt;ref name= Ware/&gt;

'''&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;WhyIStayed''' became a trending hashtag in November 2014 in defense of [[Domestic Violence|domestic abuse]] victims after a media release of security camera footage that appeared to show [[NFL]] player, [[Ray Rice#Domestic Violence|Ray Rice]], punching his then-fiancee, Janay Rice, sparked public conversation on why Janay and other victims of abuse choose to stay in abusive relationships. The [[hashtag]] was started by writer and domestic abuse survivor [[Beverly Gooden]] via [[Twitter]] in an effort to "change the tone of the conversation."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/09/living/rice-video-why-i-stayed/|title=Meredith Vieira Explains #WhyIStayed|website=cnn.com|last1=Grinberg|first1=Emanuella|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began to trend nationally five hours after its creation&lt;ref name="Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/news/beyond-ray-rice-whyistayed-hashtag-personalizes-domestic-violence-1D80137572|title=Beyond Ray Rice: #WhyIStayed personalizes domestic violence|website=today.com|last1=Serico|first1=Chris|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used more than 46,000 times that day, according to the Web analytics tool, [[Topsy (analytics)|Topsy]].&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/09/10/why-i-stayed-hashtag-twitter-ray-rice/15385027/|title=#WhyIStayed: Powerful Stories of Domestic Violence|website=usatoday.com|last1=Lee|first1=Jolie|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''#WhyILeft''' was a later addition to the Twitter conversation.

== Background ==
Beverly Gooden's rationale for staying with her husband was that it was step one in her move to eventually leave her abusive relationship; Janay Rice, on the other hand, expressed that she has no intention of divorcing her now-husband and does not view herself as an abuse victim.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/11913473/janay-rice-gives-own-account-night-atlantic-city|title=Janay Rice, in her own words|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of media attention after the release of the tape, Janay came out in support of Ray on [[Instagram]], writing, "To make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret every day is a horrible thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3308901/janay-rice-ray-rice-nfl-baltimore-ravens/|title=Janay Rice Instagrams a statement defending her husband and criticizing the media and NFL|website=Time|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the pull to stay together for the sake of their daughter, Rayven, Janay argued that the violent night in [[Atlantic City]] was an anomaly in their relationship. In an interview with [[ESPN]], she said, "As angry as I was, I knew it was something that we could move on from because I know Ray."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She added that the violence was not one-sided; Janay was the one to initiate it, slapping Ray before he assaulted her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She stressed that she hopes people can see the love that the two have for one another despite one isolated incident, and how much they have grown because of it.

On November 8, 2014, creator [[Beverly Gooden]] posted the following message to her website to elaborate on her inspiration for #WhyIStayed:

"The internet exploded with questions about [Janay Rice] … why didn't she leave? Why did she marry him? Why did she stay? I can't speak for Janay Rice, but I can speak for Beverly Gooden. Why did I stay? … Leaving was a process, not an event. And sometimes it takes a while to navigate through the process. I believe in storytelling. I believe in the power of shared experience. I believe that we find strength in community. That is why I created this hashtag. I hope those tweeting using #WhyIStayed find a voice, find love, find compassion, and find hope."&lt;ref name="Today" /&gt;

Stories of why victims stayed varied from feeling unable to leave out of fear to not knowing that abuse was abnormal. Victims left because they realized their lives were in jeopardy, they started to believe they deserved better, and/or they wanted to protect their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/national/domestic-abuse-the-spotlight-with-whyistayed-and-whyileft-hashtag-campaigns/EPLRCWUFgJ4XEZD4DQUn6M/|title=Domestic abuse in the spotlight with #WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft...|last=Desk|first=Cox Media Group National Content|website=ajc|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
In response to #WhyIStayed/#WhyIleft, Janay said she was thankful that her experience with domestic violence instigated the movement. Despite the difficulty of enduring the scrutiny that comes from the publicization of a private moment, Janay said that the fact that it began a conversation about abuse was a silver lining.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The hashtag gained significant attention from national media, as well as from the [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]] via Twitter. The organization thanked all who were sharing their stories with #WhyIStayed and informed users about their services.&lt;ref name="Today" /&gt;

== Misuse of the hashtag ==
After #WhyIStayed became a trending topic on [[Twitter]], it was mistakenly used by the [[DiGiorno|DiGiorno's Pizza]] Twitter handle as a marketing effort. They tweeted, "#WhyIStayed You had pizza."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abc7chicago.com/sports/twitter-backlash-when-digiorno-uses-whyistayed-to-sell-pizzas-after-ray-rice-scandal/301149/|title=Twitter backlash when DiGiorno uses #WhyIStayed to sell pizzas after Ray Rice scandal|date=2014-09-09|work=ABC7 Chicago|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administrator for the account later removed the tweet and apologized for the mistake, claiming that no one had looked into the implication of the trending hashtag before taking to Twitter. While many Twitter users brushed over the error, others were deeply angered as they believed DiGiorno was making light of an incredibly serious topic. In response, DiGiorno answered every negative tweet with personal messages conveying their apologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katrina-sands/a-lesson-in-crisis-commun_b_5794122.html|title=A Lesson in Crisis Communications, Courtesy of DiGiorno|last=Sands|first=Katrina|date=2014-09-10|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiGiorno has since removed the original tweet—but not before screenshots were taken to verify the event.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3308861/digiorno-social-media-pizza/|title=DiGiorno Used a Hashtag About Domestic Violence to Sell Pizza|website=time.com|last1=Stampler|first1=Laura|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2014/09/09/whyistayed-digiorno-and-other-corporate-disasters/|title=#WhyIStayed, DiGiorno, and Other Corporate Disasters|website=washingtonpost.com|last1=Petri|first1=Alexandra|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
