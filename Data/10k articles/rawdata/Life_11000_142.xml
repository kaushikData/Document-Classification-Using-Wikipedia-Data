{{nihongo|'''Abe no Yoritoki'''|安倍頼時}} (died 28 August 1057) was the head of the [[Abe clan]] of [[Emishi]] who were allowed to rule the six Emishi districts (Iwate, Hienuki, Shiwa, Isawa, Esashi and Waga) in the Kitakami Basin from Morioka to Hiraizumi in what is now Iwate Prefecture.

==Background==
The clan emerged from the Appi River basin in what is now Hachimantai City, Iwate Prefecture, early in the 9th century. They provided a number of generals and governors throughout the 9th and 10th centuries. By monopolizing the gold, iron and horse trade in northern Honshū the family became enormously wealthy. They were also innovative in designing a new type of stockade which could withstand a long siege.

The 9th and 10th centuries saw a weakening of central power as a new land management system of tax-immune estates, or shoen, took hold.

==Campaign==
Yoritoki and the Abes came into conflict with the Minamoto clan as it began to expand north into Abe territory. The Abe clan began to raid territories south of their border. In 1051 Yoritoki led an army of Emishi into northern Miyagi and defeated a government army at Onikiribe that had been sent to stop the raids. This event triggered the Former Nine Years' War ([[Zenkunen War]]).

[[Minamoto no Yoriyoshi]] was then deputized as the new ''[[Chinjufu Shogun]]'' and sent to chastise Yoritoki in 1053. In 1056 Yoritoki's eldest son, Sadato, began skirmishing with the Minamotos. War erupted in 1057 and Yoritoki was killed in battle by a stray arrow.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd, Joyce. (1982). Lessons from History: the Tokushi Yoron, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoritoki's sons continued fighting for a time but were finally overwhelmed by combined Minamoto and Kiyowara armies in 1062.&lt;ref name=Sansom&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sansom |first=George |title=A history of Japan to 1334 |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1958 |ISBN=0804705232 |pages=249–251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Yoritoki was the father of -
* [[Abe no Sadato]] (1019–1062) who occupied the Kuriyagawa Stockade;
* [[Abe no Munetō]] (1032–1108) who was based at the Isawa Stockade;
* [[Abe no Masato]] who occupied the Kurosawa Stockade;
* [[Abe no Norito]] who stayed at the Koromo Stockade with his father;
* a daughter who married [[Taira no Nagahira]];
* a daughter who married [[Fujiwara no Tsunekiyo]]. Through this daughter Yoritoki became the grandfather of [[Fujiwara no Kiyohira]], the founder of the [[Northern Fujiwara]] dynasty.

Yoritoki is also one of the distant forefathers of [[Shinzō Abe]], the prime minister of Japan, through Munetō.

'''Alcira Soust Scaffo''' (4 March 1924 – 30 June 1997) was a [[Uruguay]]an teacher and poet who lived in [[Mexico]] for more than two decades. During the occupation of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) by the [[Mexican Army]] in 1968, she remained hidden for 15 days in a bathroom at the university. This episode became a notable anecdote of the [[Mexico 68]] movement, and was also included in [[Roberto Bolaño]]'s novels.

==Biography==
Alcira Soust Scaffo was the youngest of three sisters in a middle class family. From an early age she excelled academically, managing to become a schoolteacher at 20. She obtained an interim assistantship at Escuela Granja No. 43 in Chileno Grande, on the north coast of the [[Río Negro (Uruguay)|Río Negro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://garciamadero.blogspot.com/2009/05/ronda-de-la-nina-sola-cuando-alcira-fue.html |title=Ronda de la niña sola. Cuando Alcira fue mima |trans-title=Rounds of the Lone Girl. When Alcira was Mima |last=Yacobazzo |first=Marlene |work=[[Brecha (newspaper)|Brecha]] |language=Spanish |date=26 May 2009 |access-date=17 November 2017 |via=Archivo Bolaño}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s she settled in Mexico. She received a scholarship from the Center for Regional Cooperation for Adult Education in Latin America and the Caribbean (''Centro de Cooperación Regional para la Educación de Adultos en América Latina y el Caribe''; CREFAL) to attend the training course for Fundamental Education Specialists in [[Pátzcuaro]], Michoacán. This was attended by three other compatriots, including {{ill|Miguel Soler|es}}, who would lead CREFAL years later.

At CREFAL, Soust worked with indigenous and peasant communities. At the conclusion of the course she wrote an essay on the importance of recreation entitled "Recreation in the structure of personality", which would be the first thesis published by CREFAL.&lt;ref name=Sorprende&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2017/06/15/cultura/a04n1cul |title=Sorprende cómo Alcira Soust 'dejó tanta huella en México' |trans-title=Surprise How Alcira Soust 'Left Such a Mark in Mexico' |last=Mateos-Vega |first=Mónica |work=[[La Jornada]] |page=4 |language=Spanish |date=15 June 2017 |access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the course, Soust got an extension of the scholarship to study muralism with [[Rufino Tamayo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.lajornadamaya.mx/2017-06-15/Rivindicando-a-la-poeta-Alcira-Soust-Scaffo |title=Rivindicando a la poeta Alcira Soust Scaffo |trans-title=Reclaiming the Poet Alcira Soust Scaffo |last=Mateos-Vega |first=Mónica |work=[[La Jornada]] Maya |language=Spanish |date=15 June 2017 |access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 she married a doctor, from whom she separated in 1962.

==1968 incident at UNAM==
In 1968, Alcira Soust resided and worked on the UNAM campus. In the absence of a stable job, she lived on small tasks that were given by some professors of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters (mainly translations of French), with the help of her friends, and through the drawings and poems that she delivered at will or simply gave away.

She had connected with the poets of the Mexico City scene, where she became friends with [[José Revueltas]]. Soust is the basis for the character of Auxilio Lacouture from the novel ''[[The Savage Detectives]]'', in which Roberto Bolaño recreated the literary environment of that time.&lt;ref name=joven&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/entrada-de-opinion/2017/08/1/la-joven-que-se-oculto-del-ejercito-en-los-banos-de-la-unam |title=La joven que se ocultó del ejército en los baños de la UNAM |trans-title=The Young Woman Who Hid from the Army in the UNAM Bathrooms |last=Villa Román |first=Elisa |work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]] |language=Spanish |date=1 August 2017 |access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, and later in ''[[Amulet (novel)|Amulet]]'', Soust's resistance is reconstructed literarily during the invasion of UNAM by the Mexican Army.&lt;ref name=Sorprende/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/subnotas/4753-799-2008-08-10.html |title=Los reales infra-visceralistas |work=[[Página/12]] |language=Spanish |date=10 August 2008 |access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university campus was invaded and occupied by the army on 18 September 1968. Some witnesses maintain that Soust helped students to escape and put verses of [[León Felipe]] on the loudspeakers as a peaceful protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Alcira Soust, la poeta de Bolaño en busca de la verdadera Auxilio Lacouture |trans-title=Alcira Soust, Bolaño's poet in search of the true Auxilio Lacouture |last=Bajter |first=Ignacio |work=Quimera Revista de Literatura |number=305 |pages=70-76 |language=Spanish |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of being imprisoned led her to hide in a bathroom in the Humanities Tower, where she remained for the 15 days that the occupation lasted.&lt;ref name=joven/&gt;

This fact transformed her into a legend of the student movement, which came to consider her the Uruguayan that "resisted" the military occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.laizquierdadiario.com.mx/Alcira-la-poeta-del-68-mexicano-entre-Roberto-Bolano-y-Jose-Revueltas?var_ajax_redir=1 |title=Alcira, la poeta del 68 mexicano: entre Roberto Bolaño y José Revueltas |trans-title=Alcira, the Mexico 68 Poet: Between Roberto Bolaño and José Revueltas |last=Méndez Moissen |first=Sergio Abraham |work=La Izquierda |language=Spanish |date=10 November 2015 |access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Uruguay in 1988==
Sout returned to Uruguay in 1988. She arrived in Montevideo in a fragile state of health, with a letter to her family detailing her delicate psychological situation. At first, she maintained contact with her relatives, who supported her financially on many occasions. Eventually, she completely lost the link, despite a search by her family, which failed to reestablish contact.

Alcira Soust died on 30 June 1997 at age 74, due to a respiratory infection, at the [[Hospital de Clínicas "Dr. Manuel Quintela"|Hospital de Clínicas]] in Montevideo.&lt;ref name=joven/&gt;

The plot centers on a former slave after the [[American Civil War]], her haunting by a [[poltergeist]], and the visitation of her [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] daughter whom she murdered out of desperation to save her from a slave owner. Despite being a [[box office bomb]],&lt;ref name="moviefone" /&gt; ''Beloved'' received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] for [[Colleen Atwood]], and both Danny Glover and [[Kimberly Elise]] received praise for their performances.

==Plot==
Sethe is a former [[slave]] living on the outskirts of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] shortly after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. An angry [[poltergeist]] terrorizes Sethe and her three children, causing her two sons to run away forever. Eight years later, Sethe ([[Oprah Winfrey]]) lives alone with her daughter, Denver ([[Kimberly Elise]]). Paul D. ([[Danny Glover]]), an old friend from Sweet Home, the [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] Sethe had escaped from years earlier, finds Sethe's home, where he drives off the angry spirit that inhabits it. Afterwards, Paul D. proposes that he should stay and Sethe responds favorably. Shortly after Paul D. moves in, a clean and seemingly mentally handicapped young woman ([[Thandie Newton]]) named Beloved finds her way into Sethe's yard and is taken in by her.

Denver is initially happy to have Beloved around, but learns that she is Sethe's [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] daughter. Nonetheless, she chooses not to divulge Beloved's origins to Sethe. One night, Beloved, aware that Paul D. dislikes her, immobilizes him with a spell and proceeds to rape him. Paul D. resolves to tell Sethe what happened, but instead tells what has happened to a co-worker, Stamp Paid ([[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]]). Stamp Paid, who has known Sethe for many years, pulls a newspaper clipping featuring Sethe and tells her story to the illiterate Paul D.

Years ago, Sethe was raped by the nephews of Schoolteacher, the owner of Sweet Home. She complained to Mrs. Garner, Schoolteacher's sister-in-law, who confronted him. In retaliation, Schoolteacher and his nephews brutally whip Sethe, leaving a "tree" of keloid scars on her back. Heavily pregnant with her fourth child, Sethe planned to escape. Her other children were sent off earlier to live with Baby Suggs, Sethe's mother-in-law, but Sethe stayed behind to look for her husband, Halle ([[Hill Harper]]). Sethe was assaulted while searching for him in the barn. The Schoolteacher's nephews held her down, raped her and forcibly took her breast milk.

When Halle failed to comply, Sethe ran off alone. She crossed paths with Amy Denver, a white girl who treated Sethe's injuries and delivered Sethe's child, whom Sethe named Denver after Amy. Sethe eventually reached Baby Suggs' home, but her initial happiness was short-lived when Schoolteacher came to claim Sethe and her children. In desperation, Sethe slits her older daughter's throat, and attempts to kill her other children. Stamp Paid manages to stop her and the disgusted Schoolteacher departs.

Paul D., horrified by the revelation and suddenly understanding the origin of the poltergeist, confronts Sethe. Sethe justifies her decision without apology, claiming that her children would be better off dead than enslaved. Paul D. departs shortly thereafter in protest. After Paul D.'s departure, Sethe realizes that Beloved is the reincarnation of her dead daughter. Feeling elated yet guilty, Sethe spoils Beloved with elaborate gifts while neglecting Denver. Beloved soon throws a destructive tantrum and her malevolent presence causes living conditions in the house to deteriorate. The women live in squalor and Sethe is unable to work, having become physically and mentally drained by Beloved's parasitic nature. Denver becomes depressed yet, inspired by a memory of her grandmother's confidence in her, she eventually musters the courage to leave the house and seek employment.

After Denver attains employment, women from the local church visit Sethe's house at the request of her new co-worker to perform an [[exorcism]]. Their motive for doing so is partly tempered with guilt; years before, they failed to warn Sethe of Schoolteacher's impending arrival. The women from the church comfort the family, and they are praying and singing loudly when Denver's new employer arrives to pick her up for work. Sethe sees him and, reminded of Schoolteacher's arrival, tries to attack him with an icepick, but is subdued by Denver and the women. During the commotion, Beloved disappears completely and Sethe, freed from Beloved's grip, becomes permanently bedridden.

Some months later, Paul D. encounters Denver at the marketplace. He notices she has transformed into a confident and mature young woman. When Paul D. later arrives at Sethe's house, he finds her suffering from a deep malaise. He assures Sethe that he and Denver will now take care of her. Sethe tells him that she doesn't see the point, as Beloved, her "best thing", is gone. Paul D. disagrees, telling Sethe that she herself is her own best thing.

===Praise for Winfrey===
During promotion of the film, [[Thandie Newton]] said to Vogue magazine, "Here we were working on this project with the heavy underbelly of political and social realism, and she managed to lighten things up ... I've worked with a lot of good actors, and I know Oprah hasn't made many films. I was stunned. She's a very strong technical actress and it's because she's so smart. She's acute. She's got a mind like a razor blade."&lt;ref&gt;(''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' October 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Critical reception was positive, with a 78% "fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 67 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beloved (1998)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1057370-beloved/|work=Rotten Tomatoes by Flixster|publisher=Flixster, Inc.|accessdate=2013-12-29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102212724/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1057370-beloved/|archivedate=2014-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, however, was a failure at the box office and could not come close to surpassing its $80 million budget.  According to BoxOfficeMojo.com and TheNumbers.com, the movie grossed only $8,165,551 on its opening weekend,&lt;ref name="thenumbers" /&gt; ranking #5 and being beat out by the horror movie ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' which ranked #2 and grossed approx $11,830,855 the same weekend. Winfrey has gone on public record stating that she ate 30 pounds of [[macaroni and cheese]] when she was informed the Saturday after the movie opened that "we got beat by something called Chucky."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2011/01/12/exp.Piers.Oprah.Biggest.Failure.cnn | work=CNN | title=CNN.com Video | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117105619/http://www.cnn.com/video/?%2Fvideo%2Fbestoftv%2F2011%2F01%2F12%2Fexp.Piers.Oprah.Biggest.Failure.cnn | archivedate=2011-01-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oprah also claimed that ''Beloved'''s failure at the box office was the worst moment in her career and brought her into a major depression. "It was the only time in my life that I was ever depressed, and I recognised that I (was) depressed because I've done enough shows (on the topic). 'Oh, this is what people must feel like who are depressed.'"&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

Director Jonathan Demme has commented, "''Beloved'' only played in theaters for four weeks. It made $22 million dollars -- I think that's a lot of money. And the only reason it left theaters after a month was because the Disney corporation that released the picture wanted all the ''Beloved'' theaters -- where we were doing very well, in a number of situations. The Walt Disney company wanted those theaters for [[Adam Sandler|Adam Sandler's]] ''[[The Waterboy|Waterboy]]''. So, we were told that they were gonna bring us back at the end of the year, and they didn't. But the picture did very respectfully. It was in the top ten its whole life."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first=Jonathan|last=Demme|work=Reelblack}} {{YouTube|oK6vM8dZJyg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Box office records have shown that Beloved remained in theaters into the holiday season, and by December 27, 1998, had grossed $22,746,521.&lt;ref name="thenumbers" /&gt; The film later returned to theaters for two weeks in March 1999, grossing an additional $1,000.&lt;ref name="thenumbers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Beloved#tab=box-office|title=Beloved:Theatrical Performance|work=The Numbers|accessdate=2014-10-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071322/http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Beloved#tab=box-office|archivedate=2014-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also no longer listed in the top ten on the box office chart by the November 6–8 weekend and had dropped to the rank of 12 on the chart by this point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1998&amp;wknd=45&amp;p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for November 6-8, 1998 - Box Office Mojo|author=|date=|website=www.boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916013613/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1998&amp;wknd=45&amp;p=.htm|archivedate=16 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Winfrey reflected on the film, saying: "To this day I ask myself, was it a mistake? Was it a mistake to not try and make [it] a more commercial film? To take some things out and tell the story differently so that it would be more palatable to an audience? Well, if you wanted to make a film that everybody would see, then that would be a mistake. But at the time, I was pleased with the film that we did because it represented to me the essence of the ''Beloved'' book."&lt;ref name="moviefone" /&gt;

'''Benedikt syndrome''', also called '''Benedikt's syndrome''' or '''paramedian midbrain syndrome''', is a rare type of posterior circulation [[stroke]] of the [[brain]], with a range of neurological symptoms affecting the [[midbrain]], [[cerebellum]] and other related structures.

==Signs and symptoms==
It is characterized by the presence of an  [[Oculomotor nerve palsy|oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy]] and cerebellar [[ataxia]] including tremor and involuntary choreoathetotic movements.  [[Neuroanatomy|Neuroanatomical]] structures affected include CNIII nucleus, [[Red nucleus]], [[corticospinal tract]]s, [[brachium conjunctivum]], and the [[superior cerebellar peduncle]] decussation. It has a very similar cause, morphology and signs and symptoms to [[Weber's syndrome]]; the main difference between the two being that Weber's is more associated with [[hemiplegia]] (i.e. paralysis), and Benedikt's with [[hemiataxia]] (i.e. disturbed coordination of movements). It is also similar to [[Claude's syndrome]], but is distinguishable in that Benedikt's has more predominant tremor and choreoathetotic movements while Claude's is more marked by the ataxia.

==Causes==
[[Moritz Benedikt|Benedikt]] syndrome is caused by a [[lesion]] ( [[infarction]], [[hemorrhage]], tumor, or [[tuberculosis]]) in the [[tegmentum]] of the midbrain and cerebellum. Specifically, the median zone is impaired. It can result from occlusion of the [[posterior cerebral artery]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15607218 |date=Jan 2005 |vauthors=Akdal G, Kutluk K, Men S, Yaka E |title=Benedikt and "plus-minus lid" syndromes arising from posterior cerebral artery branch occlusion |volume=228 |issue=1 |pages=105–107 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2004.09.029 |journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; or paramedian penetrating branches of the basilar artery.&lt;ref&gt;AMA citation: Greenberg DA, Simon RP.

Accessed July 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=July 2017}}

==Treatment==

[[Deep brain stimulation]] may provide relief from some symptoms of Benedikt syndrome, particularly the tremors associated with the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18826349 |date=Oct 2008 |vauthors=Bandt SK, Anderson D, Biller J |title=Deep brain stimulation as an effective treatment option for post-midbrain infarction-related tremor as it presents with Benedikt syndrome |volume=109 |issue=4 |pages=635–639 |doi=10.3171/JNS/2008/109/10/0635 |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Onesource|date=February 2015}}

'''Bonaventure Baron, [[Order of Friars Minor|O.F.M.]]''' (christened Bartholomew Baron; 1610 – 18 March 1696) was a distinguished [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Franciscan]] friar and a noted theologian, philosopher, teacher and writer of Latin prose and verse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02303c.htm Bonaventura Baron profile], newadvent.org; accessed 25 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Baron was born at [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]]. His  mother, one of 14 children, was a sister of the Irish Jesuit priest, Father Ambrose Baron.  Franciscan friar and historian Father [[Luke Wadding]] was another of Baron's uncles. His brother, [[Geoffrey Baron (rebel)|Geoffrey]] acted for the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederates]] in their negotiations with the continental rulers.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

Bartholomew Baron joined the [[Franciscan]] community of Clonmel, pursued his studies in philosophy at the [[Old University of Leuven]]. Afterwards he proceeded to the [[Irish College of St Isidore]] in [[Rome]], founded by his uncle, Father Wadding. Upon the completion of his theological courses, he was appointed professor and devoted himself specially to a defense of the [[Scotism|Scotist]] system then generally assailed. During his stay in Rome he published numerous works on theology, philosophy and history, all listed below.{{cn|date=July 2015}} 

Ordained in 1634, he took the religious name Bonaventure. Around 1651 he left Rome, and went first to a house of his Order at [[Schwaz]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], and then to [[Salzburg]], where he was kindly received by Archbishop Guidobald. He was sent as [[commissary]] into Habsburg Hungary (about 1656), was again in Schwaz (1661), went to [[Paris]], taught for some time at [[Würzburg]], where he published a volume of his "Opuscula" (1668), taught theology at [[Lyon]] in southern France and finally returned to Italy. It is said that representations were made to secure his appointment to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly|Archbishopric of Cashel]], but that he declined the office. He was appointed [[historiographer]] in 1676 by [[Cosmo I de' Medici]], [[Grand-duke of Tuscany]] and was elected a member of the [[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Academy of Florence]].{{cn|date=July 2015}}
 
He died on 18 March 1696, and was buried at St Isidore in Rome, where his tomb with the inscription, written by John de Burgo, a [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the college, still exists. Two contemporary oil paintings of him have come down to us: one is in the Franciscan friary in Clonmel, the other in a Franciscan friary in Dublin. There is also a fresco of Bonaventure in the ''[[atrium (architecture)|aula]]'' of St. Isidore's College in Rome.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

==Writings==
While under the [[patronage]] of the Grand Duke he published the "Trias Tuscia", in honor of three remarkable religious of [[Tuscany]], and in the same year the "Orbes Medicei". {{cn|date=February 2015}}
 
His principal works are:
* "Panegyrici Sacroprophani" (Rome, 1643; Lyon, 1656)
* "Obsidio et expugnatio Arcis Duncannon sub Thoma Preston"
* "Praelusiones Philosophicae" (Rome, 1651; Lyon, 1661); "[[Boethius|Boetius]] Absolutus" (Rome, 1653)
* "[[John Duns Scotus|Scotus]] defensus et amplificatus" (3 volumes, Cologne, 1664)
* "Cursus Theologicus" (6 volumes, 1670)
* "Opuscula" (4 volumes of 'small works', 1666–71)
* "Annales Ordinis Sanctae Trinitatis pro redemptione captivorum ab anno 1198 usque ad annum 1297" (Rome, 1864), his last work, a history of the [[Order for Redemption of Captives]] (Trinitarians), from 1198 till 1297.

'''Brnjača''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Брњача}}; {{circa}} 1253–{{floruit}} 1264) was a Serbian princess, the daughter of King [[Stefan Uroš I]] (r. 1243–76) and Queen [[Helen of Anjou]]. Her brothers were [[Stefan Dragutin]] (r. 1276–82) and [[Stefan Milutin]] (r. 1282–1321). 

The oldest depiction of her, when she was ca. 12 years old{{sfn|Purković|1956}} is in the 1264{{sfn|Vranjski Glasnik|1970|p=265}} [[fresco]] of the burial of Queen [[Anna Dandolo]] (d. 1258) at the monastery of [[Sopoćani]] (the endowment of her father), shown with a low [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], and clothing closed up to the throat, similar to the male clothing, decorated with pearls on [[Piping (sewing)|piping]],{{sfn|Vasić|1979|p=37}} although her appearance is anachronistic.  She is depicted on a fresco in the [[narthex]] of [[Visoki Dečani]] dating to ca. 1345, alongside later Nemanjić members [[Simeon Uroš]] and [[Teodora-Evdokija]].{{sfn|Blagojević|Petković|1989}} She is depicted in the [[Nemanjić family tree (art)|Nemanjić family tree]] fresco of Visoki Dečani,{{sfn|Ćirković|Mihaljčić|1999|p=256}} which dates to ca. 1350 and is one of the most notable examples of the Nemanjić family trees.{{sfn|Đurić|1978}} She was a nun,{{sfn|Blagojević|Petković|1989}} and did not marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevanović|2004}}, {{harvnb|Kandić|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried at the [[Gradac Monastery]] (the endowment of her mother), in a tomb below her mother's [[sarcophagus]].{{sfn|Strizović|2004|p=126}}

The Old Serbian spelling of her name, as found on the Visoki Dečani family tree fresco, was {{Script|Cyrs|БРЬНЧA}}. Her name is variously rendered Brnjača (Брњача), Brnča (Брнча&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Purković|1956|p=31}}, {{harvnb|Blagojević|Petković|1989|p=227}}, {{harvnb|Stevanović|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Brnjča (Брњча{{sfn|Purković|1956|p=31}}), Bereniče (Берениче{{sfn|Vasić|1979|p=37}}), Prnjača (Прњача{{sfn|Purković|1956|p=31}}), and Prnča (Прнча{{sfn|Blagojević|Petković|1989|p=227}}). Her name is unusual.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Purković|1956|p=31}}, {{harvnb|Ćirković|Mihaljčić|1999|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; D. Kostić wrote on the reading of her name, etymological similarities and possible combinations. He noted similarity with the placename Brnjak, and Slavic male name Prnjak, but was also inclined that it was derived from Veronica.{{sfn|Purković|1956|p=31}} M. Purković said that it perhaps was a diminutive of Bernarde or Bernardine.{{sfn|Purković|1956|p=31}} It was earlier believed that ''Brnjača'' was the nickname of her mother (named so due to the main estate of her feudal state, [[Brnjak]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Srećković|first=Pantelija|title=Istorija srpskoga naroda: Vreme kraljevstva i carstva (1159-1367)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UG88AAAAMAAJ|year=1888|publisher=Kraljevsko-srpska drž. štamparija|quote=&lt;!--Јелену, познату у нашој историји под именом „краљица Брњача."

'''Celera''' is a subsidiary of [[Quest Diagnostics]] which focuses on genetic sequencing and related technologies. It was founded in 1998 as a business unit of [[Applera]], spun off into an independent company in 2008, and finally acquired by [[Quest Diagnostics]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.celera.com/celera/pr_1305673632 Quest Diagnostics Successfully Completes Acquisition of Celera, May 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally headquartered in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], [[Maryland]] (relocated to [[Alameda, California]]), it was established in May 1998 by [[PE Corporation]] (later renamed to [[Applera]]), with Dr. J. [[Craig Venter]] from [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] (TIGR) as its first president. While at TIGR, Venter and [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smith]] led the first successful effort to [[sequencing|sequence]] an entire organism's [[genome]], that of the ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' [[bacterium]]. Celera was formed for the purpose of generating and commercializing genomic information.  Its stock is a [[tracking stock]] of Applera, along with the tracking stock of Applera's larger [[Applied Biosystems]] Group business unit.

Celera sequenced the human genome at a fraction of the cost of the public project, approximately $3 billion of taxpayer dollars versus about $300 million of private funding. However, a significant portion of the human genome had already been sequenced when Celera entered the field, and thus Celera did not incur any costs with obtaining the existing data, which was freely available to the public from [[GenBank]]. Celera's use of the shotgun strategy spurred the public HGP to change its own strategy, leading to a rapid acceleration of the public effort.

Critics of initial efforts by Celera Genomics to hold back data from sections of genome they sequenced for commercial exploitation felt that it would retard progress in science as a whole.  These critics pointed to the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] policy for gene sequences from the publicly funded [[Human Genome Project]].  Later, the company changed their policy and made their sequences available for non-commercial use but set a maximum threshold for amount of sequence data that a researcher could download at any given time.

The rise and fall of Celera as an ambitious competitor of the [[Human Genome Project]] is the main subject of the book ''The Genome War'' by [[James Shreeve]], who followed Venter around for two years in the process of writing the book. A view from the public effort's side is that of [[Nobel laureate]] Sir [[John Sulston]] in his book ''The Common Thread: A Story of Science, Politics, Ethics and the Human Genome''. Anthropologist Paul Rabinow also based his 2005 book ''A Machine to Make a Future'' on Celera.

[[File:Molech babylon.jpg|thumb|500 px|Babylonian [[cylinder seal]] representing child sacrifice]]

'''Child sacrifice''' is the [[ritual]]istic killing of [[child]]ren in order to please or appease a [[god]] or [[supernatural]] beings in order to achieve a desired result. As such, it is a form of [[human sacrifice]]. The practice has received considerable opposition throughout history, and it has often become a target for those engaged in [[criticism of religion]].
Child sacrifice is thought to be an extreme extension of the idea that, the more important the object of sacrifice, the more devout the person giving it up is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Sacrificium.html|title=LacusCurtius • Greek and Roman Sacrifices (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Columbian cultures==
{{Main|Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures}}

===Aztec culture===
[[File:Aztec ritual for flooding.jpg|thumb|250 px| 1499, the [[Aztecs]] performing child sacrifice to appease the angry gods who had flooded [[Tenochtitlan]]]]
[[Archeologist]]s have found remains of 42 children. It is alleged that these remains were sacrificed to [[Tlaloc]] (and a few to [[Ehécatl]], [[Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Huitzilopochtli]]) in the offerings of the [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]] by the [[Aztecs]] of pre-Columbian [[Mexico]]. Human sacrifice was an everyday activity in Tenochtitlan and children were not exempt. They, in particular, were offered to Tláloc, the god of rain. Bernardino de Sahagún, a religious man left writings that describe such sacrifices, compiled from the first-hand accounts of natives who had lived in Tenochtitlan in the times before it fell. Hernán Cortés himself also mentioned child sacrifices in his letters to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Carlos I of Spain]].

===Inca culture===
The [[Inca]] culture sacrificed children in a ritual called ''[[qhapaq hucha]]''. Their frozen corpses have been discovered in the [[South America]]n mountaintops. The first of these corpses, a female child who had died from a blow to the skull, was discovered in 1995 by Johan Reinhard.&lt;ref&gt;http://gallery.sjsu.edu/sacrifice/precolumbian.html - "Pre-Columbian Andean Sacrifices"&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods of sacrifice included [[strangulation]] and simply leaving the children, who had been given an intoxicating drink, to lose consciousness in the extreme cold and low-oxygen conditions of the mountaintop, and to die of [[hypothermia]].

=== Maya culture ===
In [[Maya civilization|Maya]] culture, people believed that supernatural beings had power over their lives and this is one reason that child sacrifice occurred.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mortuary Landscapes of the Classic Maya|last=Scherer|first=Andrew|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifices were essentially to satisfy the supernatural beings. This was done through ''k'ex'', which is an exchange or substitution of something.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through ''k’ex'' infants would substitute more powerful humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was thought that supernatural beings would consume the souls of more powerful humans and infants were substituted in order to prevent that.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Infants are believed to be good offerings because they have a close connection to the spirit world through [[liminality]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ardren|first=Traci|date=2015|title=Burial and the Social Imaginary of Childhood|url=|journal=Social Identities in the Classic Maya Northern Lowlands: Gender, Age, Memory, and Place|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that parents in Maya culture would offer their children for sacrifice and depictions of this show that this was a very emotional time for the parents, but they would carry through because they thought the child would continue existing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is also known that infant sacrifices occurred at certain times. Child sacrifice was preferred when there was a time of crisis and transitional times such as famine and drought.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is archaeological evidence of infant sacrifice in tombs where the infant has been buried in urns or ceramic vessels. There have also been depictions of child sacrifice in art. Some art includes pottery and [[stele]]s as well as references to infant sacrifice in mythology and art depictions of the mythology.

===Moche culture===
The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] of northern [[Peru]] practiced mass sacrifices of men and boys.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080506113520/http://www.exn.ca/mummies/story.asp?id=1999041452 – [[Discovery Channel - Archive.org]] article&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timoto-Cuica culture===
The [[Timoto-Cuicas]] offered human sacrifices. Until colonial times children sacrifice persisted secretly in [[Laguna de Urao]] ([[Mérida (state)|Mérida]]). It were described by the chronicler [[Juan de Castellanos]], who cited that feasts and human sacrifices were done in honour of [[Icaque]], an Andean prehispanic goddess.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saber.ula.ve/bitstream/123456789/18495/1/articulo3.pdf De los timoto-cuicas a la invisibilidad del indigena andino y a su diversidad cultural&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://issuu.com/bnahem/docs/revista_digital_timoto_cuicas Timoto-Cuicas&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Near East==

===Tanakh (Hebrew Bible)===
References in the Tanakh point to an awareness of human sacrifice in the history of [[ancient Near Eastern]] practice. The king of [[Moab]] gives his firstborn son and heir as a whole burnt offering (''olah'', as used of the Temple sacrifice). In the book of the prophet [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]], the question is asked, 'Shall I give my firstborn for my sin, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Micah|6:7|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and responded to in the phrase, 'He has shown all you people what is good. And what does Yahweh require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.'&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Micah|6:8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tanakh also implies that the [[Ammon (nation)|Ammonites]] offered child sacrifices to [[Moloch]].{{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Leviticus Leviticus 20:2}}

====Ban in Leviticus====
In Leviticus 18:21, 20:3 and Deuteronomy 12:30-31, 18:10, the [[Torah]] contains a number of imprecations against and laws forbidding child sacrifice and human sacrifice in general. The [[Tanakh]] denounces human sacrifice as barbaric customs of [[Baal]] worshippers (e.g. Psalms 106:37).
[[James Kugel]] argues that the Torah's specifically forbidding child sacrifice indicates that it happened in Israel as well.&lt;ref&gt;" It was not just among Israel's neighbors that child sacrifice was countenanced, but apparently within Israel itself. Why else would biblical law specifically forbid such things – and with such vehemence?" However, [[Chananya Goldberg]] argues that such a point is illogical - for if it were to be accepted, one would be forced to assume that, within Israel, people killed, stole and injured with impunity. [[James Kugel]] (2008). ''How to Read the Bible'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark S. Smith]] argues that the mention of "Topeth" in Isaiah 30:27–33 indicates an acceptance of child sacrifice in the early Jerusalem practices, to which the law in Leviticus 20:2–5 forbidding child sacrifice is a response.&lt;ref&gt;" Smith also cites Ezekiel 20:25-26 as an example of where Yahweh refers to "the sacrifice of every firstborn". These passages indicate that in the seventh century child sacrifice was a Judean practice performed in the name of YHWH...In Isaiah 30:27-33 there is no offense taken at the tophet, the precinct of child sacrifice. It would appear that the Jerusalemite cult included child sacrifice under Yahwistic patronage; it is this that Leviticus 20:2-5 deplores." [[Mark S. Smith]] (2002). ''The early history of God: Yahweh and the other deities in ancient Israel'', pp. 172–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have stated that at least some [[Israelites]] and Judahites believed child sacrifice was a legitimate religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;
*Susan Nidditch (1993). ''War in the Hebrew Bible: A Study in the Ethics of Violence'', Oxford University Press, p. 47. "While there is considerable controversy about the matter, the consensus over the last decade concludes that child sacrifice was a part of ancient Israelite religion to large segments of Israelite communities of various periods." However, no mainstream Jewish sources allow child-sacrifice, even in theory. All mainstream Jewish sources state, or imply, that such an act is abhorrent.
*[[Susan Ackerman (biblical scholar)|Susan Ackerman]] (1992). ''Under Every Green Tree: Popular Religion in Sixth-Century Judah'', Scholars Press, p. 137. "the cult of child sacrifice was felt in some circles to be a legitimate expression of Yawistic faith."
*Francesca Stavrakopoulou (2004). "King Manasseh and Child Sacrifice: Biblical Distortions of Historical Realities', p283. "Though the Hebrew Bible portrays child sacrifice as a foreign practice, several texts indicates that it was a native element of Judahite deity-worship."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Binding of Isaac====
{{main|Binding of Isaac}}
Genesis relates the [[binding of Isaac]], him to present his son, [[Isaac]], as a sacrifice on [[Moriah|Mount Moriah]]. No reason is given within the text. Abraham agrees to this command without arguing. The story ends with an [[angel]] stopping Abraham at the last minute and making Isaac's sacrifice unnecessary by providing a ram, caught in some nearby bushes, to be sacrificed instead. [[Francesca Stavrakopoulou]] has speculated that it is possible that the story "contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac". Rabbi A.I. Kook, first Chief Rabbi of Israel, stressed that the climax of the story, commanding Abraham not to sacrifice Isaac, is the whole point: to put an end to the ritual of child sacrifice, which contradicts the morality of a perfect and giving (not taking) monotheistic God.&lt;ref&gt;"Olat Reiya", p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Irving Greenberg the story of the [[binding of Isaac]], symbolizes the prohibition to worship God by [[human sacrifices]], at a time when [[human sacrifices]] were the norm worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Greenberg. 1988. The Jewish Way: Living the Holidays. New York : Summit Books. p.195.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gehenna and Tophet====
{{main|Tophet}}
The most extensive accounts of child sacrifice in the Hebrew Bible refer to those carried out in [[Gehenna]] by two kings of Judah, [[Ahaz]] and [[Manasseh]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher B. Hays Death in the Iron Age II &amp; in First Isaiah 2011 p181 "Efforts to show that the Bible does not portray actual child sacrifice in the Molek cult, but rather dedication to the god by fire, have been convincingly disproved. Child sacrifice is well attested in the ancient world, especially in times of crisis."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Book of Judges}}
In the [[Book of Judges]], the figure of [[Jephthah]] makes a vow to God, saying, "If you give the Ammonites into my hands, whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord’s, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering" (as worded in the [[New International Version]]). Jephthah succeeds in winning a victory, but when he returns to his home in [[Mizpah in Gilead (Judges)|Mizpah]] he sees his daughter, dancing to the sound of [[timbrel]]s, outside.  After allowing her two months preparation, Judges 11:39 states that Jephthah kept his vow. According to the [[meforshim|commentators of the rabbinic Jewish tradition]], Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life, fulfilling the vow that she would be devoted to the Lord.&lt;ref name="Radak-MD"&gt;[[David Kimhi|Radak]], [[Book of Judges]] 11:39; ''Metzudas Dovid'' ibid&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st-century CE Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]], however, understood this to mean that Jephthah burned his daughter on Yahweh's altar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=Athalya|author-link=Athalya Brenner|title=Judges: a feminist companion to the Bible|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84127-024-1|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=De4itoIYD9oC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=josephus++Jephthah++++burned++daughter+altar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Yg_6TtiIKI-68gOVray9AQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=josephus%20%20Jephthah%20%20%20%20burned%20%20daughter%20altar&amp;f=false|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [[pseudo-Philo]], late first century CE, wrote that Jephthah offered his daughter as a burnt offering because he could find no sage in Israel who would cancel his vow. In other words, this story of human sacrifice is not an order or requirement by God, but the punishment for those who vowed to sacrifice humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Bible Commentary|author1=Carol Ann Newsom |author2=Sharon H.

===Phoenicia and Carthage===
{{See also|Religion in Carthage}}
Neighbors criticized Carthage for their child sacrifice practices. [[Plutarch]] (ca. 46–120 AD), [[Tertullian]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], and [[Diodorus Siculus]] mention this practice; however, [[Livy]] and [[Polybius]] do not. The ancestors of Carthage, Canaanites, were also mentioned performing child sacrifices in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and by some Israelites, at a place called the [[Tophet]] ("roasting place").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theancientworld.net/civ/carthage_culture.html|title=The Carthaginians - Culture|website=www.theancientworld.net|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these sources suggest that babies were roasted to death on a heated bronze statue. According to Diodorus Siculus, "There was in their city a bronze image of Cronus extending its hands, palms up and sloping toward the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire."(Bib. Hist. 20.14.6)

Sites within [[Carthage]] and other [[Phoenicia]]n centers revealed the remains of young children in large numbers; some historians{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} interpret this as evidence for frequent and prominent child sacrifice to the god [[Baal-hamon]].

The accuracy of such stories is disputed by some modern historians and archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05146/510878.stm Carthage tries to live down image as site of infanticide&lt;/ref&gt;  At Carthage a large cemetery exists that combines the bodies of both very young children and small animals, and those who assert child sacrifice have argued that if the animals were sacrificed, then so too were the children.&lt;ref name="plosone.org"&gt;Skeletal Remains from Punic Carthage Do Not Support Systematic Sacrifice of Infants http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009177&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent archaeology however, has produced a detailed breakdown of the ages of the buried children and, based on this and especially on the presence of prenatal individuals – that is, [[still birth]]s – it is also argued that this site is consistent with burials of children who had died of natural causes in a society that had a high [[infant mortality rate]], as Carthage is assumed to have had. That is, the data support the view that Tophets were cemeteries for those who died shortly before or after birth, regardless of the cause of death.&lt;ref name="plosone.org"/&gt;

Greek, Roman and Israelite writers refer to Phoenician child sacrifice. However, some historians have disputed this interpretation, suggesting instead that these were resting places for children miscarried or who died in infancy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Skeptics suggest that the bodies of children found in Carthaginian and Phoenician cemeteries were merely the cremated remains of children that died naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GUfAW0dEcrQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Phoenicians&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=child%20sacrifice&amp;f=false|title=The Phoenicians|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergio Ribichini has argued that the Tophet was "a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were "offered" to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead".&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Ribichini, "Beliefs and Religious Life" in Moscati, Sabatino (ed), ''The Phoenicians'', 1988, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; The few Carthaginian texts which have survived make absolutely no mention of child sacrifice, though most of them pertain to matters entirely unrelated to religion, such as the practice of agriculture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

According to Stager and Wolff, in 1984, there was a consensus among scholars that Carthaginian children were sacrificed by their parents, who would make a vow to kill the next child if the gods would grant them a favor: for instance that their shipment of goods were to arrive safely in a foreign port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{cquote|the lady Tanit ...&amp;nbsp;. The hands of the statue extended over a brazier into which the child fell once the flames had caused the limbs to contract and its mouth to open ...&amp;nbsp;.

Later commentators have compared the accounts of child sacrifice in the Old Testament with similar ones from Greek and Latin sources speaking of the offering of children by fire as sacrifices in the [[Punic]] city of [[Carthage]], which was a Phoenician colony. [[Cleitarchus]] in his "Scholia" of Plato's Republic mentions the practice:

{{cquote|There stands in their midst a bronze statue of Kronos, its hands extended over a bronze brazier, the flames of which engulf the child. When the flames fall upon the body, the limbs contract and the open mouth seems almost to be laughing until the contracted body slips quietly into the brazier. Thus it is that the ‘grin’ is known as ‘[[Sardonicism|sardonic laughter]],’ since they die laughing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This reference also seems to clarify that the statue itself was not made to move by the flames, but rather the burnt and shriveled body of the victim was contorted by them.

[[Diodorus Siculus]] too references this practice:

{{cquote|[[Himilcar]], on seeing how the throng was beset with superstitious fear, first of all put a stop to the destruction of the monuments, and then he supplicated the gods after the custom of his people by sacrificing a young boy to Cronus and a multitude of cattle to Poseidon by drowning them in the sea [...] in former times they had been accustomed to sacrifice to this god the noblest of their sons, but more recently, secretly buying and nurturing children, they had sent these to the sacrifice.&lt;ref name="roger-pearse.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2012/05/31/sacrifices-of-children-at-carthage-the-sources/|title=Sacrifices of children at Carthage – the sources at Roger Pearse|work=Roger Pearse|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Plutarch]] in ''De superstitione'' also mentions the practice in Carthage:
{{cquote|they themselves offered up their own children, and those who had no children would buy little ones from poor people and cut their throats as if they were so many lambs or young birds.&lt;ref name="roger-pearse.com"/&gt;}}

These all mention the burning of children as offerings to [[Cronus]] or [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], that is to [[Ba`al Hammon|Ba'al Hammon]], the chief god of Carthage (see [[Interpretatio graeca|Interpretatio Graeca and Interpretatio Romana]] for clarification).

Claims concerning Moloch and child sacrifice may have been made for negative-propaganda effect.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The Romans and Israelites describe child sacrifice as a practice of their "evil" enemies. Some scholars think that, after the Romans finally defeated Carthage and totally destroyed the city, they engaged in postwar propaganda to make their arch-enemies seem cruel and less civilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dakotascba.com/Archaeology-3.php|title=Dakotas CB Arena|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question of whether Phoenician child sacrifice was real or a myth continues to be discussed in academic circles, including the work of [[M'hamed Hassine Fantar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSAO&amp;Volume=3&amp;Issue=6&amp;ArticleID=11|title=Were living Children Sacrificed to the Gods?

==Pre-Modern Europe==
The [[Minoan civilization]], located in ancient [[Crete]], is widely accepted as the first civilization in [[Europe]]. An expedition to [[Knossos]] by the [[British School of Athens]], led by [[Peter Warren (archaeologist)|Peter Warren]], excavated a mass grave of sacrifices, particularly children, and unearthed evidence of cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Castleden, Minoans.

The murder of children for body parts with which to make muti, for purposes of witchcraft, still occurs in South Africa. [[Muti murders]] occur throughout South Africa, especially in rural areas. Traditional healers or witch doctors often grind up body parts and combine them with roots, herbs, seawater, animal parts, and other ingredients to prepare potions and spells for their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vincent|first1=Louise|title=New magic for new times: muti murder in democratic South Africa|journal=Studies of Tribes and Tribals|date=2008|volume=Special Volume No. 2|pages=43–53|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/06-Special%20Volume-Journal/S-T%20&amp;%20T-00-Special%20Volumes/T%20&amp;%20T-SV-02-Hlth-Nut-Problems-Web/T%20&amp;%20T-SV-02-043-08-05-Vincent-Louise/T%20&amp;%20T-SV-02-043-08-05-Vincent-Louise-Tt.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uganda===
{{Main|Child sacrifice in Uganda}}

In the early 21st century Uganda has experienced a revival of child sacrifice. In spite of government attempts to downplay the issue, an investigation by the [[BBC]] into human sacrifice in [[Uganda]] found that ritual killings of children are more common than Ugandan authorities admit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Whewell]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8441813.stm "Witch-doctors reveal extent of child sacrifice in Uganda"], BBC News, 7 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; There are many indicators that politicians and politically connected wealthy businessmen are involved in sacrificing children in practice of traditional religion, which has become a commercial enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Chris 2011.

The '''Dark Judges''' are recurring villains in the ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' science fiction comic strip in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[comic book|comic]] ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''. They also appear in the 2003 computer game ''[[Judge Dredd: Dredd Vs. Death]]''. They are '''[[Judge Death]]''', '''Judge Fire''', '''Judge Fear''', and '''Judge Mortis'''. Later storylines added the "Sisters of Death" ('''Phobia''' and '''Nausea''') to their ranks. Former [[Judge Kraken]] was also a Dark Judge for a brief time during the ''Necropolis'' story.

==History==
The Dark Judges were originally a group of four lawkeepers from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel dimension]].  They were led by [[Judge Death]], who had determined that all crime was committed by the living - thus, by his logic, all life was a crime. The other three were slavishly devoted to him and his philosophy, and the four went around killing people on whatever justification they could find (Judge Fire sentenced a whole school to death for noise pollution). The society of the parallel universe they inhabited placed very little value on human life and many inhabitants were sadistic and violent, but even by the standards of their people the Dark Judges were vicious.

Things changed when Death encountered Phobia and Nausea (the future ''Sisters of Death'') in a cave. The Sisters were [[destructive cult|death cult]]ists and mass murderers with [[supernatural]] powers, and Death fell in love; the three of them committed acts on victims that he admitted sickened even him. With their help, he and his acolytes were able to become [[undead]] beings, thus being 'pure' to judge without hypocrisy. The Sisters would themselves become ethereal beings with hideous magical powers. The Dark Judges subsequently murdered the entire population of their world.

Dimension-travelling visitors chanced upon the now 'Deadworld' and found the Dark Judges. After 'judging' (i.e., killing) them and taking their dimension jumping warp devices, Judge Death travelled to [[Mega-City One]], against the opinions of his colleagues, in order to 'dispense justice'. Death was eventually defeated by the combined efforts of [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judges]] Dredd and [[Judge Anderson|Anderson]], his body having been destroyed, and his spirit form held inside Judge Anderson, herself encased in the miracle plastic [[List of technology in Judge Dredd#Boing!|Boing]] on display in the Justice Department's Hall of Heroes.

Having sensed Death's peril, his comrades Fear, Fire and Mortis crossed the dimension warp to rescue him. Released from imprisonment and with a new body created, the four Dark Judges continued their 'judgement' upon Mega-City One claiming thousands of victims. Dredd and Anderson intervened, and pursued the Dark Judges back to Deadworld using a Dimension Jump Globe liberated from the Dark Judges. There, the spirits of the Dark Judges' millions of victims flowed through Anderson and seemingly extinguished their spirits forever.

However, the Dark Judges were not destroyed but merely weakened, and four years later, Judge Anderson was duped into returning to Deadworld, where she was forced to resurrect them. Armed with [[Teleportation|teleporter]] technologies, the four returned to Mega-City One, leaving Anderson for dead. Anderson survived, however, and used the dimension warp technology against the Dark Judges, consigning them to limbo, the void between dimensions. This is where they were to remain for the next few years.

Following Judge Dredd's resignation and his replacement by the ex-[[Judge]] [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]] (recounted in the Judge Dredd stories ''[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#"Tale of the Dead Man"|Tale of the Dead Man]]'' and ''Countdown to [[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]]'' respectively), the sisters of Death - Phobia and Nausea - used their powers to influence Kraken and rescue the Dark Judges from Limbo.  With the Mega-City One judge force under their control, the Dark Judges created [[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]] - the city of the dead, killing 60 million citizens. Judges Dredd, Anderson and [[Judge McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]], together with a handful of [[Judge (2000 AD)#Training|cadet judges]], returned via [[Undercity (Judge Dredd)|The Undercity]] to defeat them - returning the Sisters of Death to Deadworld, imprisoning Fear, Fire and Mortis within secure containment, and executing Kraken, who had become a fifth Dark Judge.

Judge Death eluded capture by hiding in the burial pits of the [[Cursed Earth]] and departed for another dimension, but was eventually captured by Dredd with the aid of [[Batman]] (see ''[[Judgement on Gotham]]''). Judge Death would escape several other times, with the most significant being when the Joker (see below) dimension-jumped to Mega-City One and freed the four prisoners when they were being transferred to a more secure prison. They entered a sealed hedonist community and slaughtered their way through it before Dredd, Anderson, and Batman could stop them again.

In 2124, Death was released again - after a series of child murders to bring out Anderson, he beat her into a coma so she couldn't track him, infected her with the supernatural Half-Life virus, and escaped into the Cursed Earth. He then went on a killing spree and searched for [[weapons of mass destruction]], finally taking out [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] before seemingly being destroyed by the angry ghosts of his victims. However, the Sisters of Death - now with three extra members - attacked again in 2127, striking blocks with poltergeist activity and plagues before Psi-Division drove them back; and during Death's time in the Cursed Earth, he created another undead killer named Mordechai to carry on after him.

In 2134, during a major Soviet-backed attack on Mega-City One, Soviet sleeper agent Judge Haldane used a forged warrant to enter the Dark Judge containment vault and open the containment vessels. He stole the imprisoned Fear, Fire, and Mortis, and with another sleeper agent he gave the Dark Judges physical form again. (They promptly killed the agents, to Haldane's horror.)&lt;ref&gt;Progs 1779-1781, "[[Day of Chaos]]: Eve Of Destruction"&lt;/ref&gt; They were later captured by genius serial killer [[PJ Maybe]].&lt;ref&gt;''2000 AD'' #1786&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Death was freed from Hell by the Sisters of Death.&lt;ref&gt;''2000 AD'' #1912&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the home of PJ Maybe and rescued his brothers. They escaped from Earth on a spaceship, the ''Mayflower'', and killed most of the passengers and crew. They were pursued by Dredd and Anderson, who managed to defeat them and left them stranded in space.&lt;ref&gt;''2000 AD'' #2015 and #1912-1921&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character details==
The Dark Judges are [[undead]], and as such, cannot be conventionally killed. Their true forms are [[incorporeal]] spirits that must inhabit corpses in order to cause physical harm. This involves obtaining recently deceased cadavers, which are subsequently processed by machinery that produces "dead fluids." These fluids bring the corpses to "full ripeness," prefatory for the spirits to inhabit and animate. The incarnate Dark Judges are emaciated, [[zombie]]-like humanoids with sharp claws that frequently serve for them to injure their victims. All four speak with a hiss.

Once incarnated, the Dark Judges don uniforms (or "robes of office") which reflect their identities. The uniforms are variants of the traditional [[Judge (2000 AD)|judge]] uniforms, with specific modifications based upon the judges' personalities.

'''[[Judge Death]]''' wears a [[helmet]] similar to that of a traditional Judge, with a modified visor resembling a [[portcullis]]. His mouth is pulled into a rictus. In place of the Judges' eagle-shaped shoulder [[pauldrons]], Death sports a [[pterodactyl]] on his right shoulder; his left shoulder and elbow pads are festooned with bones. His jacket is fastened with crude stitches rather than a zipper, and his badge and belt buckle are each shaped like a human skull with extended fangs, the latter is also adorned with bat wings. Death most often kills his victims by reaching directly into their chests (in an intangible state) and squeezing their hearts until they burst, without ever breaking the skin.

[[Image:Gazeintofist.jpg|thumb|400px|"Gaze into the fist of Dredd!" - artwork by [[Brian Bolland]]]]
'''Judge Fear''' is an imposing figure who wears a black [[great helm]] accented with large, bat-like wings. When passing judgement, he opens his helmet's faceplate and frightens the accused to death with whatever lies within, whilst reciting his catch phrase, "Gaze into the face of Fear!" The actual face under the helmet has only been revealed twice: once as a mass of eyeballs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/851294-judge_fear_5.png |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423211727/http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/851294-judge_fear_5.png |archivedate=2018-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on another occasion as several grotesque mandibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/851295-judge_fear_6.png |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423211727/http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/851295-judge_fear_6.png |archivedate=2018-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No explanation has been given as to whether these monstrosities are indicative of Fear's physical face, or if they are simply manifestations of his victims' fears. Fear sports an assortment of tools on his belt, notably miniature [[animal trapping|bear traps]], which he is known to throw at his enemies in order to immobilize them; and an enormous padlock which he uses to secure his victims' potential exit routes. His belt buckle is a [[shrunken head]]. In "Die laughing" the shrunken head was revealed to be an explosive weapon, similar in effect to a hand grenade, when Judge Fear used it in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Batman. He wears a heavy black cape with large, bear trap shoulder [[pauldrons]]. In Progs. 421 and 423, Judge Fear is seen to exhibit powers similar to Judge Death's "phasing" ability, thrusting his hands through victims' bodies.

'''Judge Fire''' is immersed head-to-toe in ethereal [[flame]]. He wears no helmet, and instead has a human skull for a head. He wields a flame-spewing [[trident]]. He earned the name "Judge Fire" when he was still alive, after he burned down a school for violating noise regulations.

'''Judge Mortis''' is in a perpetual state of disintegration, and his touch can cause spontaneous decay at a rapid rate. His head is a sheep skull and he has a bony tail. His uniform's right shoulder pauldron is a bird skeleton, and his left shoulder is protected by a perforated mantle. His badge is a stylized sheep skull with his name emblazoned in wood. Like Fire and Fear, Mortis spent his early years as a rookie Judge at Law School, Deadworld's equivalent to [[Mega-City One]]'s [[Academy of Law]], and graduated after [[Judge Death|Sidney De'ath]]. He developed an admiration for Sidney's methods and beliefs, and shares his comrades' zeal for passing arbitrary death sentences. He is sometimes employed by Judge Death to prepare the Dark Judges' host bodies.

===Additional characters===

* '''Nausea''' is a haglike, decayed humanoid with an assortment of gory tentacles, claws and eyeballs on her right shoulder and elbows. Her left shoulder has two apparently live human heads on it. Her badge is a human skull, much like Death's. Both she and Phobia have supernatural and psychic powers, including the power to increase decay and darken the sun in areas. As spectral beings, they cannot be physically damaged and need only a psychic anchor in Mega-City One to attack.
* '''Phobia''' looks much like her sister, but has an extended proboscis and live heads as earrings. Her right shoulder is covered by a large scorpion, and her elbows and knees by spiders. Snakes wrap around her arms. Her left shoulder is a mass of worms, and her badge is a spider.

The undead incarnations of Nausea and Phobia normally only appear as [[spirit]]s, although they do appear in their mortal form in the Judge Death [[prequel]] story, ''Young Death: Boyhood of a Superfiend''.

* '''[[Judge Kraken]]''' (using the name '''Dredd'''), while a Dark Judge, was appropriately decayed. He suffered the loss of his right hand by inadvertently trying to use another judge's [[Lawgiver (Judge Dredd)|lawgiver]], thereby setting off its self-destruct mechanism. He wore the usual Judge's uniform, though it was cracked and deformed. Unlike the others, he was forcibly turned into a Dark Judge by Death and made to kill people against his will, while being allowed his normal feeling and remorse as "a final twist of the knife".
* '''Pustula''', '''Ephemera''' and '''Dementia''' are three "cousins" of the Sisters. Pustula is an obese, boil and pus-ridden monster who spreads the "blisteria-101" virus, which turns its victims, including robots, into a mass of boils. Ephemera is a naked ghostly figure with a mane of hair, who creates heavy [[poltergeist]] activity. Dementia resembles a normal human, naked, and surrounded by bats - covering her breasts and genitalia - and toxic mud on her hands, who inspires waves of suicidal dementia. Where they came from is unknown.
* '''Half Life''' was a formerly human victim of the Sisters, before being turned into an insect-headed, poison-spreading monster. His toxic, disease-ridden spirit was turned into a psychic virus, one that Judge Death infected Anderson's mind with when he defeated her in 2124. When modified by the insane Judge Fauster of [[Psi Division]]'s Department of Magic, it became a psychic infection, inspiring a wave of mass murder across Mega-City One.
* '''Mordechai''', while not said to be a Dark Judge, was another one of Death's creations and possessed similar powers and motive. A walking corpse, he possessed telekinesis and plants rotted at his passing. He considered himself working for the Cursed Earth itself, keeping it free of life.

In February 2014, IDW announced that nine new Dark Judges were to premiere in a forthcoming Judge Dredd title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/11/judge-dredd-takes-on-judge-death-and-the-dark-judges|title=Judge Dredd Takes on Judge Death and The Dark Judges|first=Joshua|last=Yehl|date=11 February 2014|website=ign.com|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324105051/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/11/judge-dredd-takes-on-judge-death-and-the-dark-judges|archivedate=24 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IDW Dredd is usually considered non-canonical.  The new judges were:

* '''Judge Choke''', a skeleton surrounded by fog that choked its victims.
* '''Judge Sleep''', a female dark judge that put her victims into an endless sleep.
* '''Judge Stigmata''', a humanoid covered in cuts and carrying a knife in its stomach who induced its victims to self-harm.
* '''Judge Burroughs''', a mole-like creature that created tunnels that destroyed buildings.
* '''Judge Sludge''', capable of spraying victims in a thick ooze.
* '''Judge Fistula''', a walking, talking tumor that stabbed victims with extruded tendrils.
* '''Judge Skinner''', a humanoid with transparent skin who could magically remove its victims's skins.
* '''Judge Metastasis''', a conglomerate being composed of many victims, each of whom it summoned to join the whole, forming a human-shaped giant.
* '''Judge Blank''', a creature of pure void that could teleport victims.  Judge Blank was not in league with the others and was implied to be Judge Anderson.

The ''Dreams of Deadworld''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/08/the-dark-judges-returning-to-2000ad-for-dreams-of-deadworld.html flickeringmyth.com] "The Dark Judges returning to 2000 AD for Dreams of Deadworld"&lt;/ref&gt; arc in the September 2015 2000 ADs introduced dark judges that existed on Deadworld prior to a coup by Death and his three lieutenants.  They were:

* '''Judge Reaper''', a large, male human with a dark, empty face.
* '''Sister Despair''', a female who teams up with Judge Reaper.
* '''Judge Omen''', who was [[Precognition|precognitive]].
* '''Judge Flyblown''', an obese man with [[digitigrade]] legs.
* '''Judge Ossify''', a misshapen giant with protruding bones.
* '''Sister Bedlam''', a female with a vertically-oriented mouth.
* '''Judge Silence''', who held his hands over his mouth and said nothing.
* '''Judge Scourge''', who attacked with spike-studded tentacles.

==The Joker as a Dark Judge==
For a very brief time, DC comic's [[Joker (comics)|"The Joker"]] character was a Dark Judge, in the original graphic novel ''Die Laughing'' (1998). The Joker helped free the original Dark Judges in exchange for immortality. He received his payment by having his spirit merged into a corpse (which was not quite the "immortality" he'd sought), creating "Judge Joker". As a Dark Judge, the Joker could kill masses of people with his laugh, which caused human heads to explode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everydayislikewednesday.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/the-batmanjudge-dredd-collection-part-4.html Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817091039/http://everydayislikewednesday.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/the-batmanjudge-dredd-collection-part-4.html |date=2016-08-17 }} at Every Day is Like Wednesday website (retrieved 4 July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

His tenure was a brief one, as he quickly became bored with slaughter simply for its own sake and did not share the original Dark Judge's fanatical zeal for their "sacred mission" of purging all life. The Joker was restored to his normal, mortal form upon returning to [[Gotham City]] via a defective dimensional jump device.

==Deadworld Judges==

The Judges of Deadworld wore similar uniforms to those of Mega-City One judges, coloured black with red trim; and a pterodactyl device on the right shoulderpad. They were brutal and a law unto themselves: a recruitment poster exhorted candidates to join the Judges and offered such incentives as ''"Beat people up. Kill anyone you like (within reason). Good rates of pay. Plenty of graft. Vicious nature a plus. [[Luncheon Voucher|LUNCHEON VOUCHERS]]."''&lt;ref&gt;''Young Death: Boyhood of a Superfiend'', [[Judge Dredd Megazine]] issues 1-12&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly they easily attracted psychopaths such as the future Dark Judges; and in their last days applied the death penalty for even the slightest of misdemeanors. When the Dark Judges seized power, the Deadworld Judges were inspired to join them and assisted in the massacre of the entire population before being killed themselves.

Deadworld, despite having a Judge system and having some degree of future tech, did not possess [[City Block (Judge Dredd)|City Block]]s or most of the features the Mega-Cities do, instead being very much like 20th Century Earth. Dreaming was considered abnormal and dangerous, and those who dreamt repeatedly were often Psis, who were rounded up by the Judges. Instead of the Academy of Law, they had Law School overseen by a Principal. Trainee Judges would spend a day in court, sentencing minor offenders (a young Death would be told that it would be "fine" to sentence a minor offender to death and borderline acceptable to kill two or three).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10839">In October 2015, 19-year-old '''Lucas Leonard''' from [[Chadwicks, New York]], died from injuries sustained during an hours-long 'counseling' session at his church, the Word of Life Christian Church in [[New Hartford, New York|New Hartford]], [[Oneida County, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/nyregion/brother-who-survived-beating-at-new-york-church-to-testify-against-relative.html&lt;/ref&gt; Both he and his brother (who survived, albeit with severe injuries), were repeatedly beaten by parishioners during the session, and among those indicted in connection with the beating were Leonard's own parents and older sister.

==Background==
The Chadwicks Word of Life Christian Church reportedly started out as an ordinary [[Pentecostal]] church before becoming ever more cult-like after pastor Jerry Irwin retook control and began shaming and controlling other members. One of Irwin's relatives accused Lucas of having been involved in [[witchcraft]] and [[Afro-American religion|voodoo]], but these accusations were refuted by police.&lt;ref name="cult1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/ex-members-church-where-teens-beaten-talk-decline-142926191.html|title=Ex-members of church where teens were beaten talk of decline|first=Mary|last=Esch|date=13 October 2015|work=[[Yahoo!

==Incident==
On the night of October 11, 2015, following a Sunday church meeting, Leonard was allegedly subject to an all-night counseling session in the church attended by about 30 parishioners, including his parents and older sister. The meeting was reportedly held after Leonard expressed a desire to leave the church.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; Lucas and his 17-year-old brother, Christopher, were allegedly beaten continuously.&lt;ref name="inquis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whip"/&gt; According to witness testimony, the session lasted 14 hours and ended when the parishioners thought Lucas was dead.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; Lucas died in hospital the next day.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Autopsy results revealed "multiple contusions from blunt-force trauma to the torso and extremities", including blows to the genital area.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/16/us/new-york-church-assault-case/|title=Police: Teen killed in N.Y. church assault wanted out|first1=Ray |last1=Sanchez|first2=Lawrence |last2=Crook|date=17 October 2015|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indictments and investigation==
A grand jury handed down indictments to Leonard's parents, Bruce and Deborah Leonard, for first-degree manslaughter; it also indicted four other church members, including Leonard's older sister, Sarah Ferguson.&lt;ref name="inquis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cny"/&gt; Animals subsequently rescued from Lucas' parents' house were found to have been living in neglect, and the house was foul-smelling and full of garbage.&lt;ref name="animals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/animals-rescued-from-trash-strewn-home-of-parents-charged-in-church-beating/|title=Animals rescued from trash-strewn home of parents charged in church beating|author=CBS/AP|date=19 October 2015|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbors described the church as isolated from the local community and as a cult, with one saying that "church members used to build fires on the roofs, and there was chanting and weird rituals", and that dogs howled all night inside the church but were never seen outside.&lt;ref name="inquis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2503378/word-of-life-church-cult-accusations-arise-after-teens-horrific-beating-death/|title=Word of Life Church: Cult Accusations Arise After Teen's Horrific Beating Death|first=Christian|last=Savoy|date=18 October 2015|work=Inquisitr News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cult expert [[Rick Ross (deprogrammer)|Rick Ross]] said "This is an old-school group...It’s typical in many ways. They’re very isolated, they've cocooned their members and homeschooled the children. Besides a web site to sell pedigree [[Yorkshire terrier|yorkies]], they were very isolated. That’s a common characteristic in cults to make sure they are the only ones influencing the member’s judgements."&lt;ref name="inquis"/&gt; A former member said that parents were routinely encouraged to beat their children as punishment for getting bad grades.&lt;ref name="nodenom"/&gt;

Following the incident, the pastor of the unrelated Word Of Life [[Assembly of God]] Church in [[Baldwinsville, New York]], began receiving threatening phone calls from people confusing his church with the one in Chadwicks.&lt;ref name="baldwinsville"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localsyr.com/news/local-news/baldwinsville-pastor-distances-church-from-chadwicks-word-of-life|title=Baldwinsville Pastor Distances His Church From Chadwicks' Word Of Life|author=[[WSYR-TV]]|date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chadwicks church, despite being Pentecostal, is not affiliated with Assembly of God or any other denomination, and is not overseen by any larger organization.&lt;ref name="nodenom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2015/11/05/ex-member-church-at-center-of-murder-probe-was-complete-hell.html|title=Ex-Member: NY Church At Center Of Murder Probe Was "Complete Hell"|work=WBNS-10 TV|author=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The townspeople held a prayer vigil outside the church on October 20. The organizers of the prayer vigil also called for Word of Life to be shut down.&lt;ref name="vigil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/crime/index.ssf/2015/10/mourners_call_for_new_hartford_church_closure_at_prayer_vigil.html|title=Mourners call for New Hartford church closure at prayer vigil|first=Patrick|last=Lohmann|date=20 October 2015|work=Syracuse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
Lucas's surviving brother, Christopher Leonard, began testifying in court starting on October 21. He said that during the beating, he was punched in the stomach, then struck on the genitals and other parts of his body with a {{convert|4|ft}}&lt;ref name="whip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/crime/index.ssf/2015/10/christopher_leonard_family_beat_me_with_4-foot_whip_made_of_a_cord.html|title=New Hartford church victim: Family beat me with 4-foot whip made of a cord|first=Patrick|last=Lohmann|date=21 October 2015|work=Syracuse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "whip" made from an electrical cord. Later on, he was forced to wear ear plugs and ear muffs, and to sit in a corner. He said the church's pastor, Tiffany Irwin, was responsible for organizing the counseling session during which the beating took place.&lt;ref name="chris2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/teen-recounts-deadly-beating-inside-secretive-church-n448746|title=Teen Recounts Deadly Beating Inside Secretive Church|author=Associated Press|date=21 October 2015|publisher=[[NBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chris"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/21/us-new-york-church-idUSKCN0SF18J20151021|title=Teenager describes fatal beating at upstate New York church|first=TG |last=Branfalt Jr.|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he saw his brother lying motionless on the floor, Christopher attempted to give him CPR but stopped once he realized Lucas was dead.&lt;ref name="whip"/&gt;

On October 23, a family court hearing was held to determine who should have custody of the Leonards' seven other underage children, aged between 2 and 15.&lt;ref name="cny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnycentral.com/news/local/fate-of-7-leonard-children-uncertain|title=Fate of Leonard children uncertain|author=[[WSTM-TV|CNY Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''digital strategy''' is a form of&amp;nbsp;[[strategic management]] and a business answer or response to a digital question,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.gartner.com/dave-aron/2013/11/12/the-difference-between-it-strategy-and-digital-strategy/|title=The Difference Between IT Strategy and Digital Strategy - Dave Aron|date=2013-11-12|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; often best addressed as part of an overall [[business strategy]]. A digital strategy is often characterized by the application of new technologies to existing business activity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/blogs-digital-what-is-digital-strategy|title=What Is A Digital Strategy? - Accenture|website=www.accenture.com|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or a focus on the enablement of new digital capabilities to their business&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/global/home/what-we-think/digitization/digital-strategy-capabilities|title=Digitization {{!}} Digital strategy and capabilities to win in a digitized world {{!}} PwC’s Strategy&amp;|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as those created by the&amp;nbsp;[[Information Age]]&amp;nbsp;and often as a result of advancements in digital technologies such as&amp;nbsp;[[Digital computers|computers]],&amp;nbsp;[[Digital data|data]],&amp;nbsp;[[telecommunication]]s,&amp;nbsp;[[Internet]], etc.). As is the case with its&amp;nbsp;[[business strategy]]&amp;nbsp;parent, a digital strategy can be formulated and implemented through a variety of different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Business_Strategy/Approaches_to_Strategic_Management|title=Business Strategy/Approaches to Strategic Management - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formulation often includes the process of specifying an organization's vision, goals, opportunities and related activities in order to maximize the business benefits of digital initiatives to an organization. These can range from an enterprise focus, which considers the broader opportunities and risks digital can create and often includes&amp;nbsp;[[customer intelligence]], collaboration, new product/market exploration, sales and service optimization,&amp;nbsp;[[Enterprise architecture|enterprise technology architectures and processes]], innovation and governance; to more marketing and customer-focused efforts such as web sites, mobile,&amp;nbsp;[[E-commerce|eCommerce]], social, site and&amp;nbsp;[[search engine optimization]], and advertising.

==Overview==
The digital strategy is part of the business strategy and experts maintain that it cannot be effective or successful if built independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Marketing Strategy: An Integrated Approach to Online Marketing|last=Kingsnorth|first=Simon|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|year=2016|isbn=9780749474706|location=London|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that it represents how the business strategy is influenced by leveraging digital resources to create differential value.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=10th European Conference on Information Systems Management: ECISM 2016|last=Silva|first=Paulo|last2=Guerreiro|first2=Antonio|last3=Quaresma|first3=Rui|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International Ltd.|year=2016|isbn=9781911218050|location=Reading, UK|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, it reshapes traditional organizational strategies into modular, distributed, cross-functional, and global business processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There, are numerous approaches to conducting digital strategy, but at their core, all go through four steps:&lt;ref name="mash1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Macala|title=How to Develop Your Digital Strategy|url=http://mashable.com/2012/09/05/how-to-digital-strategy/|accessdate=2 November 2013|newspaper=Mashable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#identifying the opportunities and/or challenges in a business where online assets can provide a solution;
#identifying the unmet needs and goals of the external stakeholders that most closely align with those key business opportunities and/or challenges;&lt;ref&gt;Center for Digital Strategies (2003): ''[http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/digital/Programs/CorporateEvents/EnablingCustFocusdOrg/Overview_Article.pdf Enabling a Customer-Focused Organization: Thought Leadership Summit on Digital Strategies]'',  Center for Digital Strategies at the Tuck School of Business and Cisco Systems&lt;/ref&gt; 
#developing a vision around how the online assets will fulfill those business and external stakeholder needs, goals, opportunities and challenges,&lt;ref&gt;Quinn (2006):  ''[http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/digital/PressHits/SCMQA.pdf Ready for the Digital Future?]'',pg. 30-31, Supply Chain Management Review.&lt;/ref&gt; and 
#prioritizing a set of online initiatives which can deliver on this vision.
Within each of those stages, a number of techniques and analyses may be employed.

===Identifying the key opportunities and/or challenges in a business===
*Stakeholder interviews
Includes one-on-one interviews, group interviews and workshops with a company's senior management, marketing and sales, operations and service stakeholders with a goal of understanding the business strategy, challenges and opportunities, products, organization, processes, supply chain and vendors, distributors, customers, and competitive landscape, as well as the potential role of their online assets.

*[[Competitor analysis]]
Includes evaluations of a company's main competitors and potential substitutes with the goal of understanding a company's strengths and weaknesses relative to their competitors and potential substitutes.  While this often includes steps found in traditional marketing competitor analysis, such as products, prices, etc.  Competitor analysis includes two unique items:

:#[[Heuristic evaluation]]: An evaluation by an expert of the usability and user experience of a company's online assets compared and contrasted to those of its competitors and potential substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen (2004):  ''[http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040119.html How Big is the Difference Between Websites?]'', Jakob Nielsen''s Alertbox.&lt;/ref&gt;
:#Features/functionality analysis: An evaluation of the features and functionality provided by a company's online assets, compared and contrasted to those of its competitors and potential substitutes.

*[[Financial analysis]]
An analysis of a company's financial data (which may include everything from public financial statements to private ERP data) with the goal of understanding the financial impact (positive and negative) that certain changes would have on a company.

*Bridge between business challenges and digital roadmap 
ASSIMPLER Blueprinting - The Business Blueprinting of the organization is designed based on the ASSIMPLER framework. ASSIMPLER stands for Availability, Scalability, Security, Interoperability, Maintainability, Performance, Low cost of ownership, Extendability and Reliability - applied to business services and processes. The framework helps model the business expectations and challenges to be addressed through the Digital Strategy.

===Identifying the unmet needs and goals of external stakeholders (consumers of online assets)===
*External stakeholder interviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalstrategies.tuck.dartmouth.edu/cds-uploads/case-studies/pdf/Norwegian.pdf | title=Case Studies | publisher=Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth | work=Vincent L. Lacorte Case Studies | date=2013 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | author1=Sibley, Dave | author2=Johnson, Eric | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503055333/http://digitalstrategies.tuck.dartmouth.edu/cds-uploads/case-studies/pdf/Norwegian.pdf | archivedate=3 May 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Includes one-on-one interviews and focus groups with a company's external stakeholders, with a goal of understanding external stakeholders behaviours, needs, goals and perceptions of the company and their industry both in the broadest business context as well as specifically online.  In addition to standard marketing strategy methodologies and questions ([[Quantitative marketing research|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative marketing research|qualitative]]), external stakeholder interviews for Digital Strategy may include [[usability testing]], an analysis of how effectively external stakeholders can use the online assets developed by a company for their intended purposes.  In digital strategy this is used to uncover usability barriers that may prevent the online vision being achieved.

*[[Ethnography|Ethnographic research]]
An analysis of external stakeholder behaviors in their environment, for example:  field observations of shoppers in a store.  In addition to standard ethnographic research, digital strategy research may include video recording of an external stakeholder using their computers or specific computer applications or web sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hbr.org/2009/03/ethnographic-research-a-key-to-strategy/ | title=Ethnographic Research: A Key to Strategy | publisher=Harvard Business Review | date=March 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | author=Anderson, Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Web analytics]]&lt;ref name="mash1"/&gt;
An analysis of the usage patterns of a company's online assets with the goal of better understanding external stakeholder behavior as well as identifying strengths and weakness of the company's current online offerings.  This may include understanding how many people are visiting a web site, what are the most popular pages, what are the most popular paths, where are people coming from, where do they drop off, how long do they stay, etc.

*Performance assessment: Review of effectiveness of current digital technologies.
*[[Path analysis (computing)|Funnel analysis]]
A specific methodology for web analytics where the company's online assets are modeled as a sales funnel, with a visit or impression representing a new lead, a certain page or action in the web site considered a conversion (such as a user hitting the purchase confirmation page) and specific pages in the web site representing specific stages of the sales funnel.  The goal of the analysis is to provide insight into the overall conversion rate as well as the key weak points of the funnel (the stages in which the largest percentages of users drop out of the funnel).&lt;ref&gt;Extra Paycheck Blog (2014):  ''[http://blog.extra-paycheck.com/wealthy-affiliate-review/ Online Business Training]'', Online Marketing.&lt;/ref&gt; This may also involve analysis of a company's [[search engine optimization]] situation and changes in online traffic pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.blissdrive.com/internet-marketing-tips/the-evolution-of-seo-how-digital-marketing-has-changed-in-the-last-5-years/ | title=The Evolution of SEO: How Digital Marketing Has Changed in the Last 5 Years | publisher=BlissDrive | date=27 March 2014 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | author=Fong, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Analytical [[Customer relationship management|CRM]]
An analysis of a company's customer databases and information repositories with the goal of segmenting customers into homogeneous groups across one or more dimensions of behavior, demographics, value, product or marketing message affinity, etc.  In digital strategy this often includes the online customer registration database which companies use to provide access to their customer specific, protected areas.

*[[Multichannel marketing|Multichannel]] analysis
An analysis of a customer's behavior (such as their purchase or service behavior) that looks across all of the different channels, in which customers interact with a company's products or information.  There are lots of different ways to do this; a representative example would be, a company focuses on the customer purchase process (how a customer becomes aware of a product, how a customer develops the intent to purchase a product, and how a customer actually purchases the product).  The analysis would look at which channels (for example:  phone, catalog, retail store, web site, 3rd party search engine, etc.) a customer uses at which stage of the purchase process, attempting to understand why each channel is used, each channel's relative [[Attribution (marketing)|attribution]] and evaluating the company's strengths or weaknesses in that particular channel for the particular stage of the process.&lt;ref&gt;Bean (2001):  ''[http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/digital/Research/ExecutivePublications/ApplicationOfTechnology.pdf The Application of Technology to Marketing:  A Twenty Year Perspective]'',pg. 5, Center for Digital Strategies at the Tuck School of Business.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Statistical survey]]s
An approach to the collection of external stakeholder feedback in a quantitative manner from a large population.  In digital strategy, surveys may be used to validate or invalidate key questions raised in more qualitative exercises such as external stakeholder interviews and focus groups.  Depending on the breadth of the survey population and the degree of variation within the population, survey results may be segmented to form homogeneous groups across one or more dimensions of behavior, demographics, value, product or marketing message affinity, etc.  Surveys are often conducted online using web surveys, e-mail lists, or 3rd party panels, although phone surveys or other offline methods may sometimes be used when there are questions as to the online savviness of a particular target population.

===Developing a vision and prioritizing a set of online initiatives===
*[[Business plan]] or [[Business case|case]]
A spreadsheet with supporting documentation that quantifies the investments and returns over time, resulting from the execution of the online strategy.  The Business plan also defines the Key Performance Indicators [[Key performance indicator|(KPIs)]] that will be used to measure and evaluate the success of the online strategy.

*Technical assessment
A design of a technical architecture which will meet the needs of the business vision and conform to the business plan and roadmap.  This is often done as a [[gap analysis]] where the current technical architecture is assessed.  A future technical architecture, which meets the needs of the online vision, is designed.  The gaps between the current state and future state are identified, and a series of initiatives or projects to fill those gaps are developed and sequenced.

*Organizational and process assessment
Similar to a technical assessment, organizational and process assessments look at the changes that need to be made to an organization and its processes in order to achieve the online vision.  They may involve a series of [[business process reengineering]] projects focused on the areas of an organization most affected by the online initiatives.

*[[IT portfolio management|Portfolio management]]
A way of prioritizing various initiatives by comparing their cost of implementation with their expected business benefits.  This is often done by creating a two by two matrix where cost of implementation runs along the x-axis (from high cost to low cost) and expected business benefit runs along the y-axis, from low benefit to high benefit.  Individual initiatives or projects are then plotted on the matrix in terms of their calculated costs and benefits.  Priorities are then determined according to which projects will provide the greatest benefit for the lowest cost.

*Online media plan
A plan detailing the allocation of media spending across online media (such as [[search engine marketing]], [[banner advertising]], and [[affiliate marketing]]) usually as part of the customer acquisition or retention elements of the digital strategy. Since the late 2000s, [[social media]] has become increasingly important in engaging with customers both for marketing and customer support purposes, especially benefiting smaller businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jasper (2015): ''[http://digitalmarketingmagazine.co.uk/articles/the-increasing-importance-of-real-time-marketing/2437 The Increasing Importance of Real-Time Marketing]''. Digitalmarketingmagazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Proof of concept
Graphical representations or an outline of key ideas or processes of the digital strategy.  These are often created in order to better communicate a key concept or to build excitement among stakeholders when building consensus or socializing a digital strategy.

*Roadmap
A high-level project plan which details the durations and dependencies of all the initiatives in the digital strategy.  The roadmap will often include checkpoints to assess the progress and success of the digital strategy, over time.

*Measurement plan
A description of the [[key performance indicators]] used to measure the effectiveness of the digital strategy as well as the process for collecting and sharing this information.  The measurement plan usually covers the financial, operational, and e-business metrics and their relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Kim (2006):  ''[http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/0,7211,39552,00.html#heading4 Reinventing The Marketing Organization:  Customer Groups Should Trump Channels, Products, Or Geography]''. Forrester.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns (2006): ''[http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/0,7211,40808,00.html Leaders Take A Strategic Approach To Web Analytics]''. Forrester.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Governance model
The organizational structure, roles, and process description of the operational entity that will manage the initiatives in a digital strategy.  The governance model describes who is responsible for what, how decisions are made, how issues are escalated, and how information on the performance of the projects is communicated within the organization.

==Personas==
As of 2007, a trend in digital strategy is the use of [[persona (marketing)|personas]] as a framework for using customer information to prioritize online initiatives.  Personas are character sketches which represent a typical member of one customer segment and highlights their needs, goals and behaviors.  Because it is representative of a customer segment, it allows decision makers to prioritize various features based on the needs of the segment.  Because it is a character sketch, it is sometimes easier for decision makers to internalize the key needs of the segment than it would be by reading large quantities of information.  A typical approach is to create the segment based on customer analysis such as customer interviews, ethnographic research, and statistical surveys.  Then assemble key decision makers or stakeholders, present the findings of the personas, and use them to kick start a brainstorming session around different online initiatives which can meet the personas needs and goals.

==Execution==
Historically, execution of a business or digital strategy is done as a big bang, with large initiatives such as site redesigns and transactional systems taking 6–12 months to develop and often an additional 6–12 months before they deliver any results.  As of 2007, a trend has emerged where companies adopt a more iterative approach to rolling out their strategies, one which leverages a series of smaller tests, which are carefully measured and analyzed and used to modify or optimize the digital strategy.  An example of this test-measure-optimize-scale approach is that a company might take some key pages on their site and test a number of versions of those pages with different marketing messages, design approaches, user experience optimizations, navigation optimizations, and even new features and functions using a [[multivariate analysis|multivariate]] or A/B test.  The company would then identify the page which had the best combination of changes in terms of some key business metric (such as conversion), analyzing the results to understand which changes were most instrumental in affecting the high conversion rate, and applying those learnings to future pages and future tests ([[conversion optimization]]).  

The advantage of this approach is that in the long run, it tends to be more successful in delivering business results, because each step is measured and adjusted for.  In addition, it tends to favor smaller (less risky, less expensive) steps rather than larger (more risky, more expensive) initiatives before getting the payback.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport (2006):  ''Competing on Analytics'', Harvard Business Review, January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The disadvantage is that over time this approach tends to converge on a solution ([[local optimum]]), not necessarily the best solution ([[global optimum]]) that might have been reached if a company starts from scratch instead of building each step on the previous one.  Another disadvantage is that although this solution tends to favor smaller, more incremental changes, there is often a larger up front cost to setting up all the measurement systems and staffing a company with the right analysts and change processes to react to these tests in a timely and effective manner.  As a result, companies often adopt a mix of big bang efforts augmented by some smaller, more iterative efforts as part of their overall strategy.  A person who is primarily focused on digital strategy may be referred to as a [[digital architect]] or digital strategist and a person who executes a digital strategy may be referred to as a [[digital marketing engineer]].

There are also several challenges when developing and implementing a digital strategy. This include human factors, particularly knowledge, skills, and attitudes, which impede full engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Context Sensitive Health Informatics: Human and Sociotechnical Approaches|last=Beuscart-Zephir|first=Marie Catherine|last2=Jaspers|first2=Monique|last3=Kuziemsky|first3=Craig|last4=Nohr|first4=Christian|last5=Aarts|first5=Jos|publisher=IOS Press|year=2013|isbn=9781614992929|location=Amsterdam|pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital strategy vs. online strategy==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2010}}
The two terms, "digital strategy" and "online strategy", tend to be thrown out somewhat interchangeably. However, there is some consensus{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} around the differences between digital strategy and online strategy.  According to some,{{who|date=May 2014}} digital strategy refers to the strategy a company takes to become a digital company, where digital connotes deeper interactions with their customers, more customized and personalized offerings and interactions, data driven decision making, and organizational models and processes that are more reactive to changes in the company's environment. Online is a subset of digital, as there may be digital assets which are not online. In this context, a company may use the term online strategy to be limited to the development of plans to deploy their online assets to maximize business results and digital strategy to be the more transformative step of changing the organization, although the latter is also referred as a [[Digital_transformation | digital transformation strategy]]. &lt;ref&gt; Matt, Christian; Hess, Thomas; Benlian, Alexander (2015).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6869">The '''dybbuk box''', or '''dibbuk box''' (in the Hebrew language known as {{hebrew|קופסת דיבוק}}, or ''Kufsat Dibbuk''), is a [[wine]] [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] which is said to be [[Haunted (possession)|haunted]] by a [[dybbuk]].  A dybbuk is a restless, usually malicious, [[spirit]] believed to be able to haunt and even possess the living. The box gained notoriety when it was auctioned on [[eBay]] with an accompanying [[Horror fiction|horror story]] written by Kevin Mannis, and is the original inspiration for the 2012 film ''[[The Possession]]''.
If a [[dybbuk]] box is burned, the box will take a long time to burn, but as it is burned, the [[dybbuk]] is fully released and cannot be returned to the box.

==Legend and historicity==
The term "dybbuk box" was first created and used by Kevin Mannis to describe a wine cabinet in the item information for an eBay auction and as the subject of his original story describing paranormal events which he attributed to the box. Mannis, a writer and creative professional by trade, owned a small antiques and furniture refinishing business in Portland, Oregon at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kevin Mannis |title=The Dybbuk Box, A.K.A.

It had belonged to a survivor of the [[Holocaust]] in German-occupied Poland named Havaleh, who had escaped to Spain and purchased it there before her immigration to the United States.&lt;ref name="Jewish"&gt;{{cite news|author = Max Gross|title = A Box Full of Bad Luck: Haunted Wine Cabinet Goes to Highest Bidder|quote = |publisher = [[The Jewish Daily Forward]]|date = February 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Havaleh's granddaughter told Mannis that the box had been bought in Spain after the Holocaust. Upon hearing that the box was a family heirloom, Mannis offered to give the box back to the family but the granddaughter insisted that he take it. "We don't want it," she said. She told him the box had been kept in her grandmother's sewing room and was never opened because a dybbuk was said to live inside it.&lt;ref name="Jewish" /&gt;

Upon opening the box, Mannis wrote that he found that it contained two 1920s pennies, a lock of blonde hair bound with cord, a lock of black/brown hair bound with cord, a small statue engraved with the Hebrew word "Shalom", a small golden wine goblet, one dried rose bud, and a single candle holder with four octopus-shaped legs.

Numerous owners of the box have reported that strange phenomena accompany it. In his story, Mannis wrote that he experienced a series of horrific nightmares shared with other people while they were in possession of the box or when they stayed at his home while he had it. His mother suffered a stroke on the same day he gave her the box as a birthday present—October 31. Every owner of the box has reported that smells of cat urine or jasmine flowers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Leslie Gornstein|title = A jinx in a box?; Maybe mischievous spirits do haunt this Jewish scroll cabinet, or maybe it's just another Web-spawned legend run wild.|quote = |publisher = Los Angeles Times|date = July 25, 2004|url =https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/669324261.html?dids=669324261:669324261&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+25%2C+2004&amp;author=Leslie+Gornstein&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=A+jinx+in+a+box%3F%3B+Maybe+mischievous+spirits+do+haunt+this+Jewish+scroll+cabinet%2C+or+maybe+it%27s+just+another+Web-spawned+legend+run+wild.&amp;pqatl=google |accessdate = October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;Collis, Clark.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3536">'''Ecological self''' is central to the school of ''Experiential [[Deep Ecology]]'', which, based on the work of Norwegian philosopher [[Arne Næss]], argues that through the process of self-actualisation, one transcends the nations of the individuated "egoic" self and arrives at a position of an ecological self.  So long as one is working within the narrower concept of self, Næss argues, environmentally responsible behaviour is a form of altruism, a "doing good for the other", which historically has been a precarious ethical basis, usually involved in exhorting others to "be good".  Næss argues that in his [[Ecosophy]], the enlargement of the ego-self to the eco-self results in environmentally responsible behaviour as a form of self-interest.

[[Warwick Fox]] argued that Næss's philosophy was based upon a variety of "transpersonal ecology" in which self-interest was firmly embedded within the interest of the ecommunity ecosphere of which the self was eternally embedded&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Warwick (1990). ''Toward a Transpersonal Ecology: Developing New Foundations for Environmentalism''. (Boston and London: Shambhala Publications).&lt;/ref&gt;

As deep ecologist [[John Seed]] has stated, "Deep ecology critiques the idea that we are the crown of creation, the measure of all being: that the world is a pyramid with humanity rightly on top, merely a resource, and that nature has instrumental value only".&lt;ref&gt;Seed, John, (2004). "The Ecological Self". (''EarthLight Magazine'' 53, Spring 2005 Vol. 14, No. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of the Ecological Self goes beyond [[anthropocentrism]], which, by contrast locates human concerns as the exclusive source of all value.  It draws upon the Land Ethic of [[Aldo Leopold]].  Leopold argued that within conventional ethics, the land itself was considered only as property, occupying a role analogous to slavery in earlier societies that permitted the ownership of people.  By comparison a land ethic enlarges the boundary of moral concern to include "soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land".  The basis of such a non-[[anthropocentric]] ethic, according to Leopold was that "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo "The Land Ethic", in ''A Sand County Almanac''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Like [[Thomas Berry]] and [[Brian Swimme]], ecological philosopher [[Freya Mathews]]&lt;ref&gt;Mattews, Freya (1991) ''The Ecological Self'' (Routledge)&lt;/ref&gt; argues that in considering the ecological self, we need to look beyond the present to the ''"[[deep time]]"'' of ages past, in the evolution of life and the creation of the cosmos, in order to consider the real roots of human consciousness.  Experiential deep ecologist [[Joanna Macy]] speaks of the Ecological Self in her book "World as Lover, World as Self",&lt;ref&gt;Macy, Joanna (2005), "World as Lover, World as Self" (Parallax Press)&lt;/ref&gt; and uses the concept in her work on "Deep Time".&lt;ref&gt;Joanna R. Macy, Molly Young Brown (1998), "Coming Back to Life : Practices to Reconnect Our Lives, Our World"; New Society Publishers (1998); {{ISBN|0-86571-391-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:edith-craig.jpg|thumb|right|Edith Craig]]
'''Edith Ailsa Geraldine Craig''' (9 December 1869 – 27 March 1947) was a prolific theatre director, producer, costume designer and early pioneer of the [[women's suffrage]] movement in England.  She was the daughter of actress [[Ellen Terry]] and the progressive English architect-designer [[Edward William Godwin]], and the sister of [[theatre practitioner]] [[Edward Gordon Craig]].

As a lesbian, an active campaigner for women's suffrage, and a woman working as a theatre director and producer, Edith Craig has been recovered by feminist scholars as well as theatre historians.&lt;ref&gt;Dymkowski (1992); Cockin (1998), among others; and Gandolfi (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Craig lived in a [[ménage à trois]] with the dramatist [[Christabel Marshall]] and the artist [[Clare Atwood|Clare 'Tony' Atwood]] from 1916 until her death.&lt;ref name=strange&gt;Holroyd (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page?|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;Rubin, Martin. [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/23/entertainment/et-book23 "''A Strange Eventful History: The Dramatic Lives of Ellen Terry, Henry Irving, and Their Remarkable Families'' by Michael Holroyd"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 23 March 2009, accessed 18 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilmore&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Am4bzJUW5cQC&amp;pg=PA90 Jill Rudd &amp; Val Gough (editors) ''Charlotte Perkins Gilmore: Optimist Reformer'' University of Iowa Press, p. 90 (1999) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Law&gt;Law, Cheryl.

==Early years==
Edith 'Edy' Craig, like her younger brother Edward, was illegitimate, as her mother, Ellen Terry, was still married to her first husband [[George Frederic Watts]] when she eloped with [[Edward William Godwin|Godwin]] in 1868. Edith Craig was born the following year at Gusterwoods Common in [[Hertfordshire]], and was given the surname 'Craig' to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Michael R. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36460 "Terry, Dame Ellen Alice (1847–1928)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 4 January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pa.essortment.com/actressellente_rdpq.htm Profile of Terry by Amanda Hodges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517111736/http://pa.essortment.com/actressellente_rdpq.htm |date=17 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived in Fallows Green, [[Harpenden]] in Hertfordshire, designed by Godwin, until 1874. The couple separated in 1875. In 1877 Terry married her second husband, Charles Wardell, an actor with the stage name Charles Kelly with whom she had worked. He became a father figure for the children leading to Craig taking the name Wardell. However, in 1907 Terry married her third husband, [[James Carew]], whom Edith Craig did not like.

Craig was educated at Mrs Cole's school, a co-educational institution in [[Earls Court]] in London, and at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]. Craig made her first appearance on the stage in 1878 during the run of ''Olivia'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]]. She trained as a pianist under Alexis Hollander in [[Berlin]], Germany, from 1887 to 1890. She also occasionally studied under [[Elizabeth Malleson]] of Dixton Manor Hall, [[Winchcombe]], Gloucestershire.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Katharine Cockin, "Craig, Edith Ailsa Geraldine (1869–1947)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39083, accessed 10 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre career==
[[File:terry-craig.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ellen Terry]] and Edith Craig onstage at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] c.1895]]
Craig joined the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] company as a costume designer and actress, touring America in 1895 and 1907 under the stage name Ailsa Craig. Edith was noted for her expertise in historically accurate costumes and began to gain recognition for them. Like her younger brother, Craig appeared with [[Henry Irving]] in a number of plays, including ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'' (1895). In 1895 her performances in [[Arthur Wing Pinero|Pinero]]'s ''Bygones'' and [[Charles Reade]]'s ''The Lyons Mail'' respectively were praised by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Eleonora Duse]]. [[George Bernard Shaw]] was a family friend of Craig's, he wrote several roles specifically for her. In Bernard Shaw's play ''[[Candida (play)|Candida]]'', it is believed that the role of Prossy was created for Craig, who originally played the role.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Craig also acted in plays by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]], toured with [[Mrs Brown-Potter]] and the Independent Theatre. In 1899, Irving employed her to make the costumes for his production of ''Robespierre'', which led to her going into business as a dressmaker as Edith Craig &amp; Co in Covent Garden until 1903. After Ellen Terry left the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] and went into management, Craig accompanied her on her tours in the English provinces and America as her stage-director, and from then play-production became her chief occupation.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Craig founded the Pioneer Players (1911–1925), a theatre society based in London.&lt;ref name=Cockin1&gt;Cockin (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page?|date=October 2015}} The Pioneer Players were known for producing formerly banned plays, plays on social humanism, women's suffrage and feminism and, from 1915, foreign plays in English. The plays in translation allowed the group to reach beyond the Actresses Franchise League and to be accepted into mainstream English theatre. Craig's mother, Ellen Terry, was president of the society. Craig served as the managing director / stage director, and her partner, Chris St. John, served as the secretary. An advisory committee included [[George Bernard Shaw]] and the President [[Gabrielle Enthoven]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in the Theatre'', 8th edition 1936, ed. John Parker&lt;/ref&gt; The Pioneer Players has been described by some critics as a women's theatre company, increasing women's opportunities in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svPeople?person_id=craied The Orlando Project of Women Writers]&lt;/ref&gt; for whom Craig produced approximately 150 plays.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

After the Pioneer Players finally closed, Craig produced plays for the Little Theatre movement at [[York]], [[Leeds]], [[Letchworth]] and [[Hampstead]]. In 1919, she was an important figure in the British Drama League (BDL), which had been formed to promote amateur theatre throughout the United Kingdom, and to encourage a lasting peace after [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Cockin2&gt;Cockin, Katharine. [http://www.english.heacademy.ac.uk/explore/publications/magazine/wordplay2/cockin.htm "Dame Ellen Terry and Edith Craig: Suitable Subjects for Teaching"], ''Wordplay'', English Subject Centre Magazine, Issue 2, October 2009, accessed 18 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Later Craig directed plays at the Everyman Theatre Hampstead and Leeds Art Theatre.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;Cockin (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page?|date=October 2015}} In 1929, the year after Ellen Terry's death, Craig converted the Elizabethan barn adjacent to Terry's house at [[Smallhythe Place]] into a theatre which she named The Barn Theatre. Here she produced [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] every year to commemorate the anniversary of her mother's death. Craig also appeared in a number of [[silent film]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2287499/ Craig on the [[Internet Movie Database]]]&lt;/ref&gt; including ''[[Fires of Fate (1923 film)|Fires of Fate]]'' (1923).

Craig was involved in many [[women's suffrage|suffrage]] groups, and sold newspapers on behalf of that cause in the street. After she met a woman selling newspapers for the Women's Freedom she became a member and worked at branch level for that group. She did not fully understand the meaning of suffragism, but formed strong opinions about it quickly. She stated that's "[she] grew up quite firmly certain that no self-respecting woman could be other than a suffragist". Craig used her theatrical experience on behalf of the [[Actresses' Franchise League]] and was also involved in various suffrage productions. She directed ''A Pageant of Great Women'', a play she devised with the writer and actor [[Cicely Hamilton]], which was performed across the United Kingdom before large audiences. ''A Pageant'' followed the concept of a [[morality play]] in which the main character, Woman, is confronted by the antagonist, Prejudice, who believes that men and women are not equal. Justice presides over the debate between Prejudice and Woman, as groups of great women process on stage as evidence of women's achievements in art, government, education, spiritual matters and battle.&lt;ref&gt;Cockin (2005), pp. 527–42&lt;/ref&gt; Craig directed each production of this play, bringing the three professional actors to perform Woman, Justice and Prejudice and the historically accurate costumes with her to each venue. Craig frequently played the role of [[Rosa Bonheur]], a lesbian artist.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
[[File:craig-atwood-marshall.jpg|thumb|right|Edith Craig, [[Clare Atwood]] and [[Christabel Marshall]] at [[Smallhythe Place]]]]
The composer [[Martin Shaw (composer)|Martin Shaw]] proposed to Craig in 1903, and she accepted. However, the marriage was prevented by [[Ellen Terry]], out of jealousy for her daughter's affection, and by [[Christabel Marshall]], who wrote under the pseudonym Christopher St. John, with whom she lived from 1899 until they were joined in 1916 by the artist [[Clare Atwood|Clare 'Tony' Atwood]], living in a [[ménage à trois]] until Craig's death in 1947.&lt;ref name=strange/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilmore/&gt;&lt;ref name=Law/&gt; Her lesbian lifestyle was looked down upon by her family. Her brother Edward said Edith's sexuality was a result of her "hatred of men, initiated by the hatred of her father". Craig became involved in several books about her mother and [[George Bernard Shaw]] which created a rift in the relationship with her brother, who asked Craig not to write about their mother, and specifically not to share the details of the family's innermost problems. [[Edward Gordon Craig]]'s book ''Ellen Terry and her Secret Self'' (1931) explicitly objected to ''Ellen Terry and Bernard Shaw: a Correspondence'' (1931) edited by Christopher St. John. In 1932 Craig co-edited with St. John ''Ellen Terry's Memoirs'' in which she replied to her brother's representation of their mother. Also in 1932 Craig adopted Ruby Chelta Craig.&lt;ref&gt;Cockin (1998), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Craig was reconciled with her brother some time before her death.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

On the death of her mother Craig committed her life to preserving her mother's legacy. She opened the family home, [[Smallhythe Place]] in Kent, England to the public. From 1939 she was supported in running the house by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. On her death she left Smallhythe Place to the National Trust as a memorial to her mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellenterryarchive.hull.ac.uk/ Ellen Terry and Edith Craig Database]&lt;/ref&gt; Craig died of [[coronary thrombosis]] and chronic [[myocarditis]] on 27 March 1947 at Priest's House, [[Smallhythe Place]] while planning a Shakespeare festival in honour of her mother. Her body was cremated. Marshall and Atwood are buried alongside each other at St John the Baptist's Church, [[Small Hythe]]. Craig's ashes were supposed to be buried there as well, but at the time of Marshall and Atwood's deaths, the ashes got lost and a memorial was placed in the cemetery instead.&lt;ref&gt;Rachlin, Ann. ''Edy was a Lady''. Troubador Publishing (2011), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Edith Craig suffered from acute arthritis especially in her hands.  In her younger days, this painful condition prevented her from becoming a professional musician. She attended the Royal Academy of Music and held a certificate in piano from Trinity College. In her later years, after the death of her mother, Craig dictated her memoirs to her friend Vera Holme, known as Jacko. Jacko wrote them down in a quarto notebook that was "lost in an attic" for decades and then sold to [[Ann Rachlin]] in 1978. They included Craig's reminiscences of her childhood and life with her mother, Edward Gordon Craig and Henry Irving. Rachlin published them in her book ''Edy was a Lady'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Rachlin (2011), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virginia Woolf]] is said to have used Edith Craig as a model for the character of Miss LaTrobe in her novel ''[[Between the Acts]]'' (1941).&lt;ref name=Cockin2/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1391">'''Gellius Egnatius''' (died 295 BC) was the leader in clan Varriani, of the [[Samnites]] during the [[Third Samnite War]], which broke out in 298 BC. By the end of the second campaign the Samnites appeared completely defeated, however in the following year Gellius Egnatius marched into [[Etruria]], and roused the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] to a close co-operation against Rome. This had the effect of withdrawing Roman troops from [[Samnium]] for a period of time; but the forces of the confederates were defeated by the combined armies of consuls [[Lucius Volumnius Flamma Violens]] and [[Appius Claudius Caecus]].

In the fourth campaign in 295 BC Egnatius induced the [[Gauls]] and the [[Umbrians]] to join the confederacy; but due to the withdrawal of the Etruscans and the Umbrians, the Gauls and the Samnites fell back beyond the [[Apennines]], and were met by the Romans near the town of [[Sentinum]]. [[Battle of Sentinum|A decisive battle]], marked by the heroic devotion of [[Publius Decius Mus (312 BC)|P. Decius Mus]], ensured that the Samnites were defeated and their leader Egnatius was slain.

'''Electronic tagging''' is a form of [[surveillance]] which uses an electronic device, fitted to the person. For example, an [[ankle monitor]] is used for people who have been sentenced to electronic monitoring by a court, or are required to wear a tag upon release from prison. It is also used in healthcare settings with people with dementia and in immigration contexts in some jurisdictions. If the device is based on [[Global Positioning System|GPS technology]], it is usually attached to a person by a probation officer, [[law enforcement]] or a private monitoring services company field officer, and is capable of tracking the wearer's location wherever there is the satellite signal to do so. Electronic monitoring tags can be also used in combination with curfews to confine defendants or offenders to their home as a condition of bail, as a stand-alone order or as a form of early release from prison. The combination of electronic monitoring with a curfew usually relies on [[radio frequency]] (RF) technology, which differs from GPS technology.

==Background==

===Conceptual history===
The use of home detention as a means of confinement and control within the home can be traced back to biblical times when the Romans placed [[Paul the Apostle]], under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibbs |first1=Anita |last2=King |first2=Denise |year=2003 |title=The electronic ball and chain? The operation and impact of home detention with electronic monitoring in New Zealand |journal=[[Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Criminology]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |doi=10.1375/acri.36.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Presidio-modelo2.JPG|thumb|Panopticon: Presidio Modelo prison, inside one of the buildings, 2005]]
In the 18th century, the English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] designed the [[Panopticon]], a hypothetical prison.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"&gt;Wood (2010){{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the Panopticon (the name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "all-seeing"), the prisoners are arranged in a ring of cells surrounding their guard, who is concealed in a tower in the center. The idea is that the guard controls the prisoners through his presumed observation: they constantly imagine his eyes on them, even when he's looking elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"/&gt;

{{Quotation|"[T]he persons to be inspected should always feel themselves as if under inspection ... for the greatest proportion of time possible, each man should actually be under inspection."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bentham, The Panopticon Writings 41 (Miran Bozovic ed., 1995) (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Bentham promoted the concept of the Panopticon for much the same reasons that spur [[criminal]]-[[justice]] innovation today{{when|date=June 2017}}—a ballooning prison population and the need for a cheap solution with light manpower demands. when the modern prison emerged,{{when|date=June 2017}} it, too, was promoted as a reform, a positive replacement for corporal or [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"/&gt;

Early prison reformers—many of them [[Quakers]] bent on repentance and redemption— had suggested that cutting people off from the rest of the world would bring them closer to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schenwar|first1=Maya|title=The Quiet Horrors of House Arrest, Electronic Monitoring, and Other Alternative Forms of Incarceration|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/house-arrest-surveillance-state-prisons|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The word "penitentiary" comes, of course, from "penitence.") Whereas the guard in Bentham's day had only two eyes, today's watcher can be virtually all-seeing, thanks to [[GPS]] monitoring technology.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"/&gt;

=== Development ===
In 1964, Ralph Kirkland Schwitzgebel (family name later shortened to "Gable") headed a research team at the Science Committee on Psychological Experimentation at [[Harvard]] University. The technologies of electronic monitoring have their roots in his (1968) experiments with prototype electronic monitoring devices. Schwitzgebel and William S. Hurd were granted patent #3,478,344 and published an article informing how such monitoring devices could be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gable|first1=Ralph K.|last2=Gable|first2=Robert S.|title=Electronic Monitoring: Positive Intervention Strategies|journal=Federal Probation|date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He developed a one-kilogram Radio Telemetry Device that could be worn by a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Black|Smith|2003|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device transmitted signals to a modified missile-tracking unit up to 400 metres away, which determined the wearer's location on a screen.&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"&gt;{{harvp|Black|Smith|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvard researchers invented and assessed a prototype monitoring system to use upon juvenile offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Gable, Left to Their Own Devices: Should Manufacturers of Offender Monitoring Equipment be Liable for Design Deject?, 2009 U. ILL. J.L. TECH. &amp; POLY 333, 335&lt;/ref&gt; The public responded unfavorably on the whole, fearing that the devices were overly intrusive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Even in 1966 it was noted that, in theory, the system could be modified to gather and transmit physiological data such as pulse rates, blood alcohol levels, brain waves, or information on other bodily functions of the wearer and, conversely, that information or stimulation could be sent back to the person wearing the transmitting device. It could also be easily adapted to serve as a listening device or two-way radio. The system was tested on volunteers who included students, parolees and mental patients, and experiments along these lines exploring its possibilities were conducted. in 1969 Schwitzgebel was granted a patent in relation to the system.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1978, in diversion from its criminal justice application, a company called BI Incorporated began selling systems that allowed dairy farmers to dispense feed to their cows automatically. The company fitted a [[radio-frequency]] tag on each cow's ear so that when the cow approached the feed dispenser, a sensor in the latter caused it to drop a ration of fodder. If the same cow returned, the sensor recognized the unique signal of the tag and prevented the cow from getting a second helping until after enough time had passed for her to digest the first.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1981, writer [[Tom Stacey]] took to the British [[Home Office]] a proposal for the electronic tagging of offenders to track their movements, or fix a home curfew, using cellular radio telephone technology. Stacey had been briefly imprisoned abroad in his former role as a foreign correspondent and had for several years served as a "Prison Visitor" in England. In a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' on 6 October 1982 he outlined the proposal and immediate founded the ''Offender's Tag Association'', composed of electronic scientists, [[penologist]]s and prominent citizens. The term 'tagging' thus entered the British English vocabulary in the penal context.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} 
In March 1983, the ''Offender's Tag Association'' held a national press conference.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Later in 1983, a district court judge in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], Jack Love, persuaded Michael Goss, a computer salesperson, to develop a system to monitor five offenders. He sentenced offenders in what is considered the first court-sanctioned use of electronic monitoring at home.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Judge Love was supposedly inspired to act based upon a storyline in a ''[[Spider-Man]]'' comic, specifically the [[The Amazing Spider-Man|newspaper comic strip version]] where the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] puts an electronic bracelet on the superhero primarily to follow his movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/qitranscripts/408.htm QI Transcript, Season 4 Episode 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012153155/http://freewebs.com/qitranscripts/408.htm |date=12 October 2007 }} [[QI]], Transcript on qitranscripts.com; Broadcast 2006; Accessed 25 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the widespread adoption of [[cellular network|cellular]] and [[broadband]] Internet networks in the US in the mid-1990s, electronic monitoring devices were typically home-based, dependent on a dedicated land line, and able to report only whether or not the criminal being tracked, was remaining at home. This was useful for criminals on work-release, [[parole]], or [[probation]], for example [[DWI]] offenders who were allowed to leave home to go to work during daytime hours but had to return home and remain there after a certain time of the evening.

Since the mid-1990s, more recent technology such as GPS and cellular networks have permitted courts to order more specific restrictions, such as permitting a registered child sex offender to leave his home at any time of day, but alerting authorities if they come within 100 metres of a school, park, or playground.

== How it works ==

=== Big picture ===
[[Trilateration]] is the process of determining absolute or relative locations of points by measurement of distances, using the geometry of [[circle]]s, [[sphere]]s or [[triangle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/605329/trilateration Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2-Dimension trilateration ====
If someone in the [[United States]] completely lost track of where he last was, asked directions in a nearby town and a local tells that he was 625 miles from [[Boise]], [[Idaho]], he could be anywhere on a circle around Boise that has a radius of 625 miles. If he then asked another person and was told that he was 690 miles from [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], he could combine this with the Boise information in two circles that intersect. He would know that he was at one of the two intersection points. If a third person told him that he was 615 miles from [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]], he could then eliminate the other options, because the third circle would only intersect with one of these points. The same concept works in three-dimensional space, as well, where there is only spheres instead of circles.
&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brian|first1=Marshall|last2=Harris|first2=Tom|title=How GPS Receivers Work|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/travel/gps.htm|publisher=How Stuff Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 3-Dimension trilateration ====
[[File:Navstar-2F.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Artist's impression of a Navstar-2F satellite in orbit.]]

If someone knows he is 10 miles from satellite A in the sky, he could be anywhere on the surface of a huge, imaginary sphere with a 10-mile radius. If he also knows he is 15 miles from satellite B, he could overlap the first sphere with another, larger sphere. If he then also knows the distance to a third satellite, he could get a third sphere, which intersects with this circle at two points.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

The Earth itself can act as a fourth sphere—only one of the two possible points will actually be on the surface of the planet, so one can eliminate the sphere in space. The GPS receiver figures both of these things out by analyzing high-frequency, low-power radio signals from the GPS satellites.

Radio waves are [[electromagnetic]] energy, which means they travel at the speed of light (about 186,000 miles per second, 300,000&amp;nbsp;km per second in a vacuum). The receiver can figure out how far the signal has traveled by timing how long it took the signal to arrive.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

The correct time value will cause all of the signals that the receiver is receiving to align at a single point in space. So the receiver sets its clock to that time value, and it then has the same time value that all the atomic clocks in all of the satellites have. When you measure the distance to four located satellites, you can draw four spheres that all intersect at one point. Three spheres will intersect even if your numbers are way off, but four spheres will not intersect at one point if you've measured incorrectly. The receiver does this constantly whenever it's on, which means it is nearly as accurate as the expensive atomic clocks in the satellites.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

In order for the distance information to be of any use, the receiver also has to know where the satellites actually are. Things like the pull of the moon and the sun do change the satellites' orbits very slightly, but the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] constantly monitors their exact positions and transmits any adjustments to all GPS receivers as part of the satellites' signals.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

For one thing, this method assumes the radio signals will make their way through the atmosphere at a consistent speed, the speed of light. Problems can also occur when radio signals bounce off large objects, such as skyscrapers, giving a receiver the impression that a satellite is farther away than it actually is. The station then broadcasts a radio signal to all DGPS-equipped receivers in the area, providing signal correction information for that area.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

The most essential function of a GPS receiver is to pick up the transmissions of at least four satellites and combine the information in those transmissions with information in an electronic almanac, all in order to figure out the receiver's position on Earth.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

Once the receiver makes this calculation, it can compute the latitude, longitude and altitude (or some similar measurement) of its current position.
One can use maps stored in the receiver's memory, connect the receiver to a computer, which can hold more detailed maps in its memory, or one can on a detailed map of an area find one´s way using the receiver's latitude and longitude readouts. A standard GPS receiver will not only place one´s position on a map at any particular location, but also trace one´s path across a map as one moves. If the receiver is switched on, it can stay in constant communication with GPS satellites to see how one´s location is changing.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

===Small picture===
The portable device is operatively coupled to a monitoring system through a wireless telephone network. The portable device transmits periodically encrypted location information as well as status information across the wireless network to the monitoring system. The monitoring system tracks the location of the individual and alerts the appropriate authorities when the individual violates a rule, such as a condition for parole. The portable device increases the time between transmissions when the individual is within a specified home location and reduces the time between transmissions when outside the specified location.&lt;ref name="Brian_Harris"/&gt;

As a fail-safe against any technological glitch, whether accidental or malicious, a leading Electronic Monitoring operator is immensely proud of its backup systems, which boast an ultra-secure data room and extreme redundancy: For example, if a toxic-gas cloud were to wipe out the town of Anderson, the last act of the staff there would be to flip the switches diverting all call traffic to BI's corporate office in Boulder, Colorado, where a team capable of taking over instantly in case of disaster is always on duty.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"/&gt;

== Other designs ==

=== Medical and health use ===
The use of electronic monitoring in medical practice, especially as it relates to the tagging of the elderly and people with [[dementia]], is capable of generating controversy, and media attention.&lt;ref name="BBC_Alzheimers"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Electronic tagging for Alzheimer's |date=27 September 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2284537.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elderly people in care homes can be tagged with the same electronic monitors used to keep track of young offenders. For persons suffering from dementia, electronic monitoring might be beneficially used to prevent them from wandering away.&lt;ref name="BBC_Alzheimers"/&gt; The controversy in its medical use relates to two arguments, one as to the safety of the patients, and the other, as to their privacy and human rights.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Louw 2002"&gt;Julian C Hughes and Stephen J Louw, ‘Electronic Tagging of People with Dementia who Wander: Ethical Considerations are Possibly more Important than Practical Benefits' (2002) 325(7369) British Medical Journal 847﹘848 &lt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1124366/ PubMed]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At over 40%, there is a high prevalence of wandering amongst patients with dementia. Of the several methods deployed to keep them from wandering, it is reported that 44% of wanderers with dementia have been kept behind closed doors at some point.&lt;ref&gt;McShane R et al, ‘Getting Lost in Dementia: A Longitudinal Study of a Behavioral Symptom' (1998) 5 International Psychogeriatrics 239﹘245&lt;/ref&gt; Other solutions have included constant surveillance, use of makeshift alarms and, the use of various drugs that carry the risk of adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Louw 2002"/&gt;

Opinions as to the propriety of electronic tagging of the elderly and persons with dementia vary. Carers welcome the idea of electronic tracking devices so long as it allows wanderers to be found more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;McShane R et al, ‘The Feasibility of Electronic Tracking Devices in Dementia: A Telephone Survey and Case Series' (1998) 13 International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry 556﹘563.&lt;/ref&gt; Some persons argue that a little liberty can be sacrificed in order to achieve safety and any concern about privacy only has force when we imagine that the person involved is trying to hide.&lt;ref&gt;McShane R, Hope T and Wilkinson J, ‘Tracking Patients Who Wander: Ethics and Technology' (1994) 343 Lancet 1274.&lt;/ref&gt; The thinking behind this argument is that, for wandering persons with severe dementia, being electronically tagged and monitored carries less stigma than being found half dressed, in the middle of the night, on a highway.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Louw 2002"/&gt; On the other side of the argument, it is contended that even in mild dementia, the need to protect a patient's right to privacy must be maintained. Even though electronic tagging and monitoring increases liberty, in a sense, it may potentially decrease the autonomy of the patient. Tracking may only settle the anxiety of Carers and family without necessarily attending to the needs of the person with dementia. What is important is to determine if persons with dementia have the capacity to make decisions, and if they do, their decisions should be respected. Where the person lacks the capacity, decisions need to be made in their best interest. Best interest in this sense does not simply mean the person's best medical interest. Deciding on their best interest will require careful inquiry, negotiation, and judgment.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Louw 2002"/&gt;

=== Commercial use ===
On an iPhone, "Location Services" allows location-based apps and websites (including Maps, Camera, Safari, and other Apple and third-party apps) to use information from Global Positioning System (GPS) networks to determine your approximate location.&lt;ref&gt;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202588&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==

The use of ankle bracelets, or other electronic monitoring devices, have proven to be effective in research studies and even deterred crime. As such, they benefit society. When applied early, they may save otherwise habitual offenders from a life of crime.&lt;ref name="Stuart S Yeh, 2010"&gt;Stuart S Yeh,[http://www.antoniocasella.eu/nume/YEH_2010.pdf ‘Cost-benefit analysis of reducing crime through electronic monitoring of parolees and probationers'] (2010) 38 Journal of Criminal Justice 1090﹘1096.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors have been identified as necessary to render electronic monitoring effective: appropriately selecting offenders, robust and appropriate technology, fitting tags promptly, responding to breaches promptly, and communication between the criminal justice system and contractors.The Quaker Council for European Affairs thinks that for electronic monitoring to be effective, it should serve to halt a developing criminal career.&lt;ref name="Quaker Council for European Affairs 2010"&gt;Quaker Council for European Affairs,[http://www.qcea.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/rprt-alternatives-en-jan-2010.pdf ‘Investigating Alternatives to Imprisonment'] (2010) .&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Audit Office in England and Wales commissioned a survey to examine the experiences of electronically monitored offenders and the members of their family. The survey revealed that there was common agreement amongst survey respondents that electronic monitoring was a more effective punitive measure than fines, and that it was generally more effective than community service. An interviewed offender is credited with saying: ‘You learn more about other crimes [in prison] and I think it gives you a taste to do other crimes because you've sat listening to other people'.&lt;ref&gt;National Audit Office, [http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/05-06/0506800.pdf ‘The Electronic Monitoring of Adult Offenders: Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General'] (1 February 2006) Appendix 4, accessed 30 May 2015, .&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Padgett, Bales and Bloomberg study ===

In 2006, Kathy Padgett, William Bales and Thomas Bloomberg conducted a well–controlled, large scale evaluation of 75,661 Florida offenders placed on home detention from 1998 to 2002.,&lt;ref name="Stuart S Yeh, 2010"/&gt; a small percentage of whom were made to wear an electronic monitoring device, which allowed comparison between those who were electronically monitored and those who were not. The study controlled for  factors thought to influence the success or failure of community supervision: the type of placement, type of electronic monitoring device (GPS or radio frequency), criminal history, offender characteristics, type of primary offence committed by each offender, court- ordered conditions of supervision, the number of weeks absconded, weeks in treatment etc. with a total of 62 variables.&lt;ref name="Padgett"&gt;Kathy Padgett, William Bales and Thomas Blomberg, [http://www.antoniocasella.eu/nume/Padgett_electronic_2006.pdf ‘Under Surveillance: An Empirical Test of the Effectiveness and Consequences of Electronic Monitoring'](2006) 5(1) Criminology and Public Policy 61–91 .&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers incorporated time-varying independent variables in the estimation of maximum-likelihood coefficients, and also applied proportional-hazards survival analysis to adjust for right-censoring.&lt;ref name="Padgett"/&gt; As of 2010, compared to other studies, no previous study of electronic monitoring controlled such an array of variables nor involved such a large sample.&lt;ref name="Stuart S Yeh, 2010"/&gt;

Regarding their rate of compliance, violent offenders monitored by GPS were 91.2% less likely to abscond than those offenders not monitored at all.  Electronic monitoring also effectively prevented offenders from committing new offences while being monitored: monitored offenders were 94.7% less likely to commit new offences than unmonitored offenders. The researchers found ‘no clear evidence that, overall, the decision to monitor offenders on home confinement with enhanced electronic control mechanisms results in ‘front-end' [[net-widening]]. In other words, offenders sentenced to home confinement with EM seem to have posed a significantly higher risk to public safety and would have had a higher likelihood of receiving a prison sentence if not for the availability of EM as an enhanced control mechanism.' In the end, GPS monitored offenders are 90.2% less likely than offenders on home confinement without EM to be revoked for a technical violation.&lt;ref name="Padgett"/&gt;

Another major advantage is the fact that wide deployment of electronic monitoring may lead to reduced prison populations. This is most likely where monitoring is used as an alternative to prison, rather than to enhance existing non-custodial orders. Major cost savings may be achieved through building fewer prisons as well as reducing the cost of administering custodial sentences.

Another is the possibility of improving rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. Electronic monitoring may allow more offenders to maintain employment and contact with their families. It also avoids any negative psychological effects of incarceration, although of course the wearing of a device carries its own psychological pressures.

===GPS jamming===
In late 2009, satellite-positioning receivers for a new navigation system at [[Newark airport]] in New Jersey were suffering brief daily breaks in reception.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Matyszczyk [http://www.cnet.com/au/news/truck-driver-has-gps-jammer-accidentally-jams-newark-airport/ Truck driver has GPS jammer, accidentally jams Newark airport]  Cnet, 12 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Economist|first1=The|title=No Jam Tomorrow|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18304246|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Something was interfering with the signals from orbiting global positioning system (GPS) satellites. A driver who passed by on the nearby New Jersey Turnpike each day used a cheap GPS jammer in his truck. Jammers prevent tracking devices from determining (and then reporting) its location.

Some truck companies use [[fleet management]] software integrated with GPS in vehicles to monitor whether their drivers ever break speed limits, and in response, some delivery drivers buy illegal GPS jammers to subvert the system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10228874/GPS-jammer-costs-driver-32000-after-interfering-with-plane-signals.html GPS-jammer-costs-driver-32000-after-interfering-with-plane-signals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820114756/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10228874/GPS-jammer-costs-driver-32000-after-interfering-with-plane-signals.html |date=20 August 2014 }} Telegraph Media Group, UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Collier [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/taxi-driver-fined-over-use-of-illegal-gps-jammer-in-fare-scam/story-fni0fee2-1226799269681 Taxi driver fined over use of illegal GPS jammer in fare scam] HeraldSun, Australia January 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Grubb [http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/illegal-mobile-phone-and-gps-jammer-crackdown-by-regulator-yields-results-20130716-2q2oo.html Illegal mobile phone and GPS jammer crackdown by regulator yields results] July 17, 2013, The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
A number of criticisms of the technology exist - some "[[Law and order (politics)|Tough on Crime]]" groups argue that electronic tagging perceived as lenient, while other groups argue that the technology enables [[Net-widening]], where non-prison bound individuals are subject to increased monitoring.

Electronic monitoring does not physically restrain a person and dangerous offenders are still able to offend before authorities can intervene. Home detention with electronic monitoring is perceived by some people as lenient.&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"/&gt;

As early as 1988, the Penal Affairs Committee of the Religious Society of Friends ([[Quakers]]), wrote a briefing in its Green Paper strongly opposing the adoption of electronic monitoring in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Penal Affairs Committee|1988|pp=13–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee noted all the claims made in favour of electronic monitoring but insisted that all such claims could be ‘either demolished or rendered invalid' by arguments against it. The major argument or criticism against it was that on the basis of past experience, electronic monitoring would not absolutely be used on people at risk of custody, but on people who would otherwise have been granted probation or community service. This would lead to a widening of the net of control rather than reducing prison population; it would undermine constructive and supportive interventions. The Penal Committee concluded that the degrading monitoring of fellow human beings, electronically, was morally wrong and unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Penal Affairs Committee|1988|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the system was inherently ‘retributive and punitive' and the wearing of an ankle monitor would be stigmatizing for women offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Nellis, ‘Quakers, Penal Reform and the Challenge of Electronically Monitoring Offenders' (2011) 25 (1–2) International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 95﹘105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US in 1990, Ronald Corbett and Gary T. Marx criticised the use of electronic monitoring in a paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the [[American Society of Criminology]], [[Baltimore]]. In the paper, which was later published in the Justice Quarterly, the authors described ‘the new surveillance' technology as sharing some ethos and the information-gathering techniques found in maximum-security prisons thereby allowing them to diffuse into the broader society. They remarked that ‘we appear to be moving toward, rather than away from, becoming a "maximum-security society."'&lt;ref name="Corbett_Marx"&gt;Ronald Corbett and Gary T. Marx, ‘Critique: No Soul In The New Machine: Technofallacies In The Electronic Monitoring Movement' (1991) 8 (3) Justice Quarterly [http://web.mit.edu/gtmarx/www/critique.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors acknowledged the data-mining capacity of electronic monitoring devices when they stated that ‘data in many different forms, from widely separated geographical areas, organizations, and time periods, can easily be merged and analyzed.'&lt;ref name="Corbett_Marx"/&gt;

In 2013, it was reported that many electronic-monitoring programs throughout the US were not staffed appropriately.&lt;ref name="Osher"&gt;Christopher N Osher, ‘Electronic Monitoring of Colorado Parolees has Pitfalls', [[The Denver Post]] (Online), 6 September 2013 [http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_23420684/electronic-monitoring-colorado-parolees-has-pitfalls &lt;http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_23420684/electronic-monitoring-colorado-parolees-has-pitfalls&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; George Drake, a consultant who worked on improving the systems said ‘Many times when an agency is budgeted for electronic-monitoring equipment, it is only budgeted for the devices themselves.' He added that the situation was ‘like buying a hammer and expecting a house to be built. It's simply a tool, and it requires a professional to use that tool and run the program.' Drake warned that programs can get out of control if officials don't develop stringent protocols for how to respond to alerts and don't manage how alerts are generated: ‘I see agencies with so many alerts that they can't deal with them,' Drake said. ‘They end up just throwing their hands up and saying they can't keep up with them.' In [[Colorado]], a review of alert and event data, obtained from the Colorado Department of Corrections under an open-records request, was conducted by matching the names of parolees who appeared in that data with those who appeared in jail arrest records. The data revealed that 212 parole officers were saddled with the duty of responding to nearly 90,000 alerts and notification generated by electronic monitoring devices in the six months reviewed.&lt;ref name="Osher"/&gt;

According to an analysis in the Journal of Law and Policy, most of those placed on electronic monitors haven't committed serious or violent offenses and, were it not for monitoring, "at least some of these populations would not in fact be incarcerated or otherwise under physical control." Eighty-nine percent of probation officers surveyed by the Justice Department felt that "offenders' relationships with their significant others changed because of being monitored." Both officers and those monitored observed that the ankle band had a distinct impact on children. As one parent testified, "When it beeps, the kids worry about whether the probation officer is coming to take me to jail. The kids run for it when it beeps."

== Jurisdictions ==

=== USA ===

The U.S. correctional system is overwhelmed by the over-incarceration of nonviolent offenders such as drug users. Private-prison corporations themselves have begun to expand into the "alternatives" industry. The GEO Group now has an array of "community reëntry services" and treatment programs.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stillman|first1=Sarah|title=Get Out of Jail Inc.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/get-out-of-jail-inc|accessdate=Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it acquired the country's largest electronic-monitoring firm, BI Incorporated, for $415 million.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"/&gt; For the most part, these companies deal not with felony probationers ("probation" as it is usually understood) but with people whose offenses are often too minor to merit jail time. The system is known as "offender-funded" justice.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"/&gt;

Jack Long, a Georgia attorney, filed a habeas petition on behalf of a client who, after stealing a two-dollar can of beer from a convenience store, was ordered to spend a year wearing an ankle bracelet operated by a company called [[Sentinel Offender Services]].&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"/&gt; The man wound up owing more than a thousand dollars to the company in fees and late-payment penalties, and started selling his blood plasma to keep pace. Dozens of probationers are jailed because of electronic-monitoring bills, most of which were not authorized by any legal statute.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2014"/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

Electronic monitoring of a curfew has become an integral part of the criminal justice system in the [[United Kingdom]], used at various stages of criminal cases used to monitor compliance with a curfew, requiring the curfewee to remain in their home for a specified number of hours a day or exclusion from specified areas (such as victim's homes and football grounds).

Those subject to electronic monitoring may be given curfews as part of [[Bail]] conditions, sentenced under the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] in England and Wales (with separate legislation applying in Scotland). Alternatively offenders may be released from a prison on a [[Home Detention Curfew]]. Released prisoners under home detention allowed out during curfew hours only for:
#A wedding or funeral (service only) of a close relative
#A job interview
#Acting as a witness in court
#Emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offendersfamilieshelpline.org/index.php/hdc/ Home Detention Curfew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, electronic monitoring may be used for those subject to a curfew given under the [[Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011]] (previously known as [[Control order]] under the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24803069&lt;/ref&gt;)

Since electronically monitored curfews were rolled out throughout England and Wales their use has increased sharply, from 9,000 cases in 1999-2000 to 53,000 in 2004-05. In 2004-05, the Home Office spent £102.3 million on the electronic monitoring of curfews and electronically monitored curfews are considered cheaper than custody.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nao.org.uk/report/the-electronic-monitoring-of-adult-offenders/&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety days in [[Detention (imprisonment)|custody]] (e.g., a prison) costs approximately five times more than the same amount of time on an electronically monitored curfew order.

Typically, offenders are fitted with an electronic tag around their ankle which sends a regular signal to a receiver unit installed in their home. Some systems are connected to a [[landline|fixed telephone line]] in the case where a [[GSM|GSM signal]] is not available, whilst most arrangements utilise the mobile phone system to communicate with the monitoring company. If the tag is not functioning or within range of the base station during curfew hours, or if the base is disconnected from the power supply, or the base station is moved then the monitoring company are alerted, who in turn, notify the appropriate authority such as the [[Police|Law enforcement in the United Kingdom]], [[National Probation Service]] or [[Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/criminology/msc/unit8/page_21.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Policy Exchange thinktank examined the use of electronic monitoring in England and Wales and made comparisons with technologies and models seen in other jurisdictions, particularly the United States. The report was critical of the Ministry of Justice's model of a fully privatised service - which gave little scope for police or probation services to make use of electronic monitoring. The report, Future of Corrections, also criticised the cost of the service, highlighting an apparent differential between what the UK taxpayer was charged and what could be found in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Corrections-Exploring-Electronic-Monitoring/dp/1907689273|title=Future of Corrections: Exploring the Use of Electronic Monitoring|last=Geoghegan|first=Rory|last2=Miller|first2=Chris|date=2012-10-01|publisher=Policy Exchange|isbn=9781907689277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of publication the Ministry of Justice was completing a procurement exercise for a new generation of GPS tags - and the report described the exercise as flawed, calling on electronic monitoring to be commissioned locally via Police and Crime Commissioners.

Subsequently, there were a number of scandals in relation to electronic monitoring in England and Wales, with a criminal investigation opened by the Serious Fraud Office into the activities of Serco and G4S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfo.gov.uk/2013/11/04/g4s-serco-investigation-2/|title=G4S and Serco investigation|date=2013-11-04|website=Serious Fraud Office|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the investigation, Serco agreed to repay £68.5 million to the taxpayer and G4S agreed to repay £109 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2015/06/25/moj-paid-g4s-serco-millions-for-electronic-tagging-during-fr|title=MoJ paid G4S &amp; Serco millions for electronic tagging during fraud investigation|last=Dunt|first=Ian|newspaper=politics.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duopoly were subsequently stripped of their contract, with Capita taking over the contract. In 2017, another criminal investigation saw police make a number of arrests in relation to allegations that at least 32 criminals on tag had paid up to £400 to Capita employees in order to have 'loose' tags fitted, allowing them to remove their tags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/arrests-after-criminals-paid-163400-to-get-loose-electronic-tags-10755416|title=Criminals 'paid £400' for loose electronic tags|newspaper=Sky News|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monitoring of sex offenders via electronic tagging is currently in debate due to certain rights offenders have in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/aug/12/larry-murphy-electronic-tagging Electronic tagging of offenders raises rights concerns], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 12 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic tagging has begun being used on psychiatric patients, prompting concern from mental health advocates who state that the practice is demeaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackmentalhealth.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=789&amp;Itemid=117 GPS tracking mental health patients - human rights concerns], BMH UK, 22 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scotland]], those convicted of a serious sexual or violent crime, and are determined to pose a serious danger to the community, are to be given a sentence, known as an [[Order for Lifelong Restriction]], which means that the offender will be detained indefinitely, until the [[Parole Board for Scotland]] determines that the offender no longer poses a risk to the safety of others. If the offender is released on [[parole]], he or she is to be electronically tagged and kept under close supervision by the Scottish Parole Board for the remainder of the offender's life.

=== Australia ===

==== Pre-trial ====
In [[Western Australia]], The Bail Act 1982 (WA) specifically provides for electronic monitoring at the pre-trial stage. The Act allows only judicial officers to impose a home detention. This is done after first obtaining a suitability report, from a corrections officer, on accused persons aged over 17. The accused person may then be required to wear a device or permit the installation of a device in the place where he/she is required to remain.

In most Australian jurisdictions, the generally broad discretion available when imposing bail conditions may permit electronic monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Nacro Youth Crime 2002, "Electronic monitoring of children remanded on bail or to local authority accommodation", Youth Crime Briefing, June&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in section 11(2) of the South Australian Bail Act 1985, the bail authority may 'impose a condition requiring an accused person to remain at his or her residence except for authorised activities such as employment.'&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"/&gt; The Supreme Court of South Australia, it is thought,&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"/&gt; may have interpreted this as authority to order electronically monitored bail, at least where the applicant is willing.&lt;ref&gt;R v Blayney [2002] SASC 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Primary sentencing ====
The [[Northern Territory]] and Western Australia have laws that specifically authorize electronic monitoring as a primary sentencing option for home detention. The ''Sentencing Act 1995'', of the Northern Territory, provides that a 'court which sentences an offender to a term of imprisonment may make an order suspending the sentence on the offender entering into a home detention order'. Such offenders may be required to 'wear or have attached an approved monitoring device in accordance with the directions of the Commissioner, and allow the placing, or installation in, and retrieval from, the premises or place specified in the order of such machine, equipment or device necessary for the efficient operation of the monitoring device'.&lt;ref&gt;Section 44 (3) (b), ''Sentencing Act 1995'' (NT).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Australia, the ''Sentencing Act 1995'' provides that a court may impose an intensive supervision order with a curfew requirement. The offender is required to submit to surveillance or monitoring as ordered;&lt;ref&gt;Section 75 (1) (b) ''Sentencing Act 1995'' (WA)&lt;/ref&gt; wear a device or have a device installed in his or her home.&lt;ref&gt;Section 75 (10) (a) &amp; (b) ''Sentencing Act 1995'' (WA)&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic monitoring 'may only be imposed for a term of six months or less'.

In [[New South Wales]], although the law does not specifically authorise electronic monitoring, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), however, grants the court the power to 'impose such conditions as it considers appropriate on any home detention order made by it'.&lt;ref&gt;Section 82 (1), ''Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999'' (NSW)&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, electronic monitoring is used to enforce these home detention orders.&lt;ref&gt;Keay, N. 2000, "Home detention: An alternative to prison?" Current Issues in Criminal Justice, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 98-105.&lt;/ref&gt; The general powers of court may also allow electronic monitoring in other States and Territories.&lt;ref name="Black_Smith"/&gt;

In August 2010, Brazil awarded a GPS Offender Monitoring contract to kick start its monitoring of offenders and management of the Brazilian governments early release programme&lt;ref&gt;[http://latinamerica.tmcnet.com/topics/brazil/articles/96256-securealert-signs-first-ever-gps-offender-monitoring-contract.htm SecureAlert Signs First-Ever GPS Offender Monitoring Contract in Brazil], TMCnet, 23 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
Electronic monitoring as a pilot project was started in March 2012, involving 150 offenders, mostly prisoners serving life terms. The project was rolled out to reduce the South Africa's prison population. It consequently would also reduce the taxpayer's burden on correctional facilities.&lt;ref name="DCS"&gt;Dept. of Correctional services: Rep of South Africa, South Africa's first ever Electronic of a Remand Detainee, 15/04/2014.&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa locks up more people than any other country on the continent.&lt;ref name="DCS"/&gt;

Dr. '''Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran''' is the former [[Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner|Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner for the County of Los Angeles]]. In 2016, he again took over this position on an interim basis.

==Education and early career==
Sathyavagiswaran graduated from [[Loyola College, Chennai]] in 1965 and [[Stanley Medical College]] in 1971. In 1972 he immigrated to the United States, where he interned at the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn. From 1972 to 1973 he trained in [[anatomic pathology|anatomical]] and [[clinical pathology|clinical]] pathology at [[St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center|St. Luke's Hospital]] of [[Columbia University]]. From 1973 to 1977 he was the senior [[residency (medicine)|resident]] in medicine at Brooklyn Cumberland Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Who's Who among Asian Americans, 1994-95|year=1994|publisher=Gale Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Los Angeles County Coroner==
In 1977 he joined the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. He worked his way up to the position of chief of forensic medicine. In 1990 he was passed over in favor of [[J. Lawrence Cogan]] for the position of  Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner.&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Richard|title=No. 2 Man Selected as County Coroner|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-12/local/me-1747_1_county-coroner|accessdate=November 30, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sathyavagiswaran was appointed Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner in 1992. The [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]]' first selection, Dr. Joshua Perper of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]], declined the job due to Los Angeles' high housing costs. The Board's second choice, Dr. Yong-Myun Rho of [[Queens, New York]], thrice failed the state medical exam. Sathyavagiswaran was then selected over Cogan after the Board of Supervisors received a letter signed by several deputy medical examiners requesting the County to consider the in house candidates rather than  outsiders.&lt;ref name=Simon /&gt;

He was the medical examiner during the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]] and testified during the criminal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/16/us/trying-on-bloody-gloves-simpson-finds-them-tight.html|title=Trying on Bloody Gloves, Simpson Finds Them Tight|date=1995-06-15|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=2009-06-17|first=Kenneth B.|last=Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt; and civil trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns9.htm|title=Coroner lays out detailed theories of killings|date=1996-10-18|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2009-06-17|author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sathyavagiswaran also testified in the trials of [[Dean Carter]] and [[Phil Spector]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/4354129/Phil-Spectors-second-mudrer-trial-Defence-presents-case.html|title=Phil Spector's second mudrer trial: Defence presents case|date=2009-01-27|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the wrongful death suit brought against the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] by the family of [[North Hollywood shootout|Emil Matasareanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WITNESS+SOFTENS+TESTIMONY+POLICE+GOT+AID+FOR+ANOTHER+MAN+THEY+THOUGHT...-a083420888|title=WITNESS SOFTENS TESTIMONY POLICE GOT AID FOR ANOTHER MAN THEY THOUGHT WAS A SUSPECT.|date=2000-02-24|publisher=Los Angeles Daily News|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sathyavagiswaran supervised the autopsy on the body of [[Michael Jackson]] on June 26, 2009.

Following the unexpected resignation of Sathyavagiswaran′s Successor Dr. Mark Fajardo in March 2016, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to appoint Sathyavagiswaran as interim coroner even though he  retired 3 years earlier..&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20160315/la-county-names-interim-coroner-amid-department-turmoil&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''list of terrorist incidents''' that have not been carried out by a [[State (polity)|state]] or its forces (see [[state terrorism]] and [[state-sponsored terrorism]]). Assassinations are listed at [[List of assassinated people]].

[[Definitions of terrorism]] vary, so incidents listed here are restricted to those that:
* are not approved by the legitimate authority of a recognized state
* are illegally perpetrated against people or property
* are done to further political, religious, or ideological objectives

[[Image:Mikołaj Kurowski.PNG|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Mikołaj Kurowski&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[Image:POL COA Szreniawa alt.svg|150px|thumb|Szreniawa coat of arms]]
'''Mikołaj Kurowski''' of [[Szreniawa Coat of Arms|Szreniawa]] of [[Kurów]] (died 1411) was a chancellor of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and a Catholic hierarch. He held the posts of the [[bishop of Poznań]], [[bishop of Włocławek]] and an [[archbishop of Gniezno]]. Releasing the name or adoptive Mirosław.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.pl/imgres?imgurl=http://www.archidiecezja.pl/www/thumb.php%3Fimg%3D/upload/pics/kurowski.jpg%26w%3D150%26h%3D150&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.archidiecezja.pl/pl/historia/arcybiskupi/poczet_arcybiskupow_gnieznienskich.html&amp;usg=__qqFTAXhmMztdGY4OHA7rCNGAy1c=&amp;h=150&amp;w=150&amp;sz=6&amp;hl=pl&amp;start=33&amp;sig2=vpoCAypbF-JeKlzRyhm0rQ&amp;itbs=1&amp;tbnid=W1iNimHDM7aFpM:&amp;tbnh=96&amp;tbnw=96&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3DBiskup%2BKurowski%26start%3D20%26hl%3Dpl%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:pl:official%26gbv%3D2%26ndsp%3D20%26tbs%3Disch:1&amp;ei=xSMWTL_4DI-FOIOTsPgL List of Archbishops of Gniezno]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Kurów near [[Bochnia]], he was a son to the [[castellan]] of [[Żarnów]] [[Klemens Kurowski]]. In 1385 he received the title of [[Bachelor of Arts]] at the [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]]. For another ten years he continued his studies there and in 1395 he received the title of ''[[magister artium]]''. During his stay in Bohemia he became friends with some of the most prominent Polish politicians of the era to come, among them [[Paweł Włodkowic]] and [[Andrzej Łaskarz]]. Upon his return to Poland he was ordained a priest. At the same time he started a political career as a clerk in the royal chancellery in [[Kraków]].

He quickly advanced through the ranks of both religious and lay hierarchy and in 1395 he was ordained a bishop of Poznań. In 1399, thanks to the support of King [[Jogaila|Władysław II of Poland]], he became the royal chancellor and bishop of Wrocław. An active politician, he spent more time in the capital than in distant capital of Silesia. In 1402 he yet again changed the bishopry and became the archbishop of Gniezno. As a diplomat, he took part in the Polish-Teutonic negotiations at [[Raciąż]] in 1404 and the council of [[Nowy Korczyn]]. He was also twice a member of the Polish embassy to the Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Order]] and, as the [[primate of Poland]], he held the post of a regent during the king's absence.

During the [[battle of Grunwald]] he fielded a banner of his own. After the battle he was one of the authors of the [[Peace of Thorn (1411)]] and the negotiations with [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]].

He was heavily wounded on 7 September 1411, in the effect of an accident with his horse, and died later that day. Kurowski was buried in the Cathedral of Gniezno.

'''Munir Said Thalib''' (8 December 1965 &amp;ndash; 7 September 2004) was an Indonesian activist. The founder of the Kontras human rights organisation and laureate of the 2000 [[Right Livelihood Award]], Munir was assassinated in 2004 while travelling to [[Utrecht University]] to pursue a Master's degree in [[international law]] and human rights.&lt;ref name="munirBBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5405952.stm Munir murder conviction quashed] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of Indonesia's most famous human rights and anti-[[Political corruption|corruption]] activists.

==Political activist career==
Munir was born into a family of [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] [[Arab]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] origins,&lt;ref&gt;Komisi Untuk Orang Hilang dan Tindak Kekerasan, ''Bunuh Munir!: Sebuah Buku Putih'' (2006) ...Munir, atau lengkapnya Munir bin Thalib dibesarkan dalam keluarga muslim keturunan Arab. Kakek moyangnya adalah imigran dari Hadhramaut (Yaman) yang ratusan...&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Kathiri]]. He studied law at [[Brawijaya University]] in [[Malang]] in the province of [[East Java]], and later started off his career in 1989 as a [[legal aid]] officer in the East Java provincial capital, [[Surabaya]]. He became one of Indonesia's leading [[human rights]] campaigners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramadhan|first=Hamzah|title=Munir Museum Brings Human Rights Issues to East Java|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/blogs/munir-museum-brings-human-rights-issues-to-east-java/|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=Jakarta Globe|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and faced intimidation, including death threats. He accused the [[Indonesian military]] of human rights violations in [[East Timor]] and in the troubled provinces of [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] and [[Aceh]], and accused them of running a criminal network involved in illegal tree logging and [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] smuggling.

He once fractured his hand whilst saving an elderly labourer from being beaten by security officials.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pitaloka|first1=Dyah Ayu|title=Remembering Munir — Human Rights Defender, Brother, Husband, Father and Friend|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/remembering-munir-human-rights-defender-brother-husband-father-friend/|accessdate=7 September 2014|work=Jakarta Globe|date=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (Kontras).&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tibke|first1=Patrick|title=Jokowi’s Challenge – Part 3: An end to impunity or same old injustices?|url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/126339/jokowis-challenge-part-3-an-end-to-impunity-or-same-old-injustices/|accessdate=6 September 2014|work=Asian Correspondent|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last position was executive director of Indonesian Human Rights Monitor (IMPARSIAL), another Indonesian human rights NGO.

In 2001, while he was investigating [[Kopassus]]'s role in kidnappings, a bomb package was delivered to his house.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Assassination and aftermath==
Munir was [[Arsenic poisoning|poisoned with arsenic]] on a flight from [[Jakarta]] to [[Amsterdam]] on 7 September 2004. He was travelling on state-owned airline [[Garuda Indonesia]]. It was concluded from Munir's autopsy and eyewitnesses during the trial that he had died two hours before arrival in [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol International Airport]]. He took the arsenic during his flight transit in Singapore, or sometime near that time. In Singapore, [[Pollycarpus Priyanto]], a Garuda pilot at the time and the prime suspect in Munir's trial, left the flight and then went back to Indonesia. Originally he departed from Indonesia by [[deadheading (aviation)|deadheading]], with a fake document which allowed him to fly on another flight which was not his scheduled flight. Munir began to suffer acute diarrhea and bouts of vomiting shortly after his flight took off from Singapore to Amsterdam. The cabin crew informed the pilot in command that a passenger was sick, and a doctor who happened to be on the plane was asked to provide medical assistance. However, Munir died around two hours before the plane landed at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/detailweekly.asp?fileid=20040908.@01 |title=Rights campaigner Munir dies on plane |work=The Jakarta Post |date=8 September 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041116123612/http://www.thejakartapost.com/detailweekly.asp?fileid=20040908.@01 |archivedate=16 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the results of the autopsy were released two months later, on 12 November, [[Netherlands Forensic Institute|the Netherlands Forensic Institute]] revealed that Munir's body contained a level of arsenic almost three times the lethal dose. This was later confirmed by [[Indonesian National Police|Indonesian police]].

There were three suspects; Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto, a former pilot who allegedly gave up his business class seat to Munir during the flight, and two flight attendants. It is alleged that Priyanto placed the [[arsenic]] in Munir's orange juice, upon orders from Garuda's chief executive at that time, Indra Setiawan. 

Indonesian president [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] proclaimed that he will make sure that Munir's killers are brought to justice and quickly convened an independent investigation. However support and resources for the investigation waned, senior officials refused to comply, and the findings were never released.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Secretary Kerry's Trip to Indonesia Should Promote Human Rights|url=http://0-search.proquest.com.www.elgar.govt.nz/docview/1439503188?accountid=40858|accessdate=7 September 2014|work=Targeted News Service|date=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto was found guilty of Munir's murder by an Indonesian court and sentenced to fourteen years imprisonment. Munir's supporters claim that Priyanto was acting on orders and that this was not brought out during the court case.

In October 2006, the [[Supreme Court of Indonesia]] [[Void (law)|invalidated]] the conviction against Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto, citing insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="munirBBC" /&gt; However, in April 2007, police presented new evidence to prosecutors implicating Priyanto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=New Munir evidence handed over | date=15 April 2007 | publisher= | url =http://www.thejakartapost.com/detailnational.asp?fileid=20070414.H09&amp;irec=8 | work =Jakarta Post | pages = | accessdate = 15 April 2007 | language = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104951/http://www.thejakartapost.com/detailnational.asp?fileid=20070414.H09&amp;irec=8 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Indra Setiawan and his deputy, Rohainil Aini, faced trial for providing Pollycarpus with fake documents to board Munir's flight from Jakarta to Singapore. They would have faced a possible death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Forbes | title=Ex-Garuda chiefs charged over murder | date=10 October 2007 | work=Sydney Morning Herald| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/10/09/1191695910401.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were both convicted and imprisoned for Munir's murder, and have appealed their convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Denied letter, activists to push to reopen Munir case|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/01/05/denied-letter-activists-push-reopen-munir-case.html|accessdate=6 September 2013|newspaper=Jakarta Post|date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a Jakarta court found that Garuda was negligent in refusing to perform an emergency landing, and ordered the company to pay 600 million [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]] in compensation to Munir's widow. When Garuda appealed this decision, the supreme court increased the compensation to an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judicial Commission tells Garuda to pay|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/02/20/judicial-commission-tells-garuda-pay.html|accessdate=6 September 2013|newspaper=Jakarta Post|date=20 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018012805/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/02/20/judicial-commission-tells-garuda-pay.html|archivedate=18 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garuda then failed to pay the compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court summons Garuda over Munir death compensation|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/14/court-summons-garuda-over-munir-death-compensation.html|accessdate=6 September 2013|newspaper=Jakarta Post|date=14 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018012944/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/14/court-summons-garuda-over-munir-death-compensation.html|archivedate=18 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Pollycarpus was released from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/29/munir-s-murderer-released-parole.html|title=Munir’s murderer released on parole|work=thejakartapost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State Intelligence Agency (BIN) involvement in assassination==
Top-level [[Indonesian State Intelligence Agency]] (BIN) officials were implicated in Munir's murder. The chief of police at the time, [[Sutanto]], allegedly knew of the BIN involvement. A BIN deputy chairman, [[Muchdi Purwopranjono]], was tried and acquitted for the murder in what has been internationally condemned as a "[[Show trial|sham trial]]".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Prosecutors accused Muchdi of ordering the killing out of anger over Munir’s criticisms of his [[Kopassus]] leadership.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osman|first1=Nurfika|title=WikiLeaks US Cables Point to BIN Role in Munir Murder|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/wikileaks-us-cables-point-to-bin-role-in-munir-murder/|accessdate=6 September 2014|work=Jakarta Globe|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the murder Priyanto made at least 26 calls to Muchdi, and a number of calls to a confidential BIN line.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

A [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] alleged that former BIN chief [[A. M. Hendropriyono]] "chaired two meetings at which Munir’s assassination was planned" and that a witness at those meetings told police that "only the time and method of the murder changed from the plans he heard discussed; original plans were to kill Munir in his office."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; When Hendropriyono was first appointed to the BIN it was bitterly condemned by Munir, who was guiding an investigation into Hendropriyono's role in human rights abuses for a prosecution.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Muchdi and Hendropriyono were both summoned for questioning by a presidential fact-finding team, but they refused to comply with the investigation. Recommendations by the team for Hendropriyono’s prosecution were completely ignored by the police and the attorney general’s office.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 2014, Hendropriyono admitted to journalist [[Allan Nairn]] that he bore "command responsibility" for the assassination, and he was ready to accept being put on trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=As Indonesia’s New President Takes Office, Cabinet Includes Officials Tied to Atrocities of Old|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2014/10/28/as_indonesias_new_president_takes_office|website=Democracy Now|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous honours==
Munir was posthumously awarded the [[Train Foundation]]'s [[Civil Courage Prize]], which recognizes "extraordinary heroes of conscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilcourageprize.org/honorees.htm |title=Honorees |author= |year=2010 |work= |publisher=Civil Courage Prize |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a museum in [[Malang]] was opened in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ayu Pitaloka|first=Dyah|title=New Museum Brings Munir’s Cases, Death To Public View|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/new-museum-brings-munirs-cases-death-to-public-view/|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=Jakarta Globe|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Munir was married to [[Suciwati]], a labour rights activist at the time. They had two children. His wife is pursuing the investigation of Munir's assassination and works to keep Munir's case and human rights at the centre of Indonesian politics.&lt;ref name=bbc20110524&gt;{{cite news|last=Hegarty|first=Stephanie|title=Indonesian human rights widow fights for justice|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13432359|newspaper=BBC|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2011, '''Leiby Kletzky''', a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Jews|Jewish]] boy, was kidnapped as he walked home from his school day camp in the mainly Hasidic neighborhood of [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Boro Park]], [[Brooklyn]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Kletzky's disappearance sparked an all-out search by New York City police and a block-by-block search by up to 5,000 [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] volunteers from New York and other states coordinated by the Brooklyn South [[Shomrim (volunteers)|Shomrim]] volunteer civilian patrol.

His [[Dismemberment|dismembered]] body was found in the [[Kensington, Brooklyn, New York|Kensington]] apartment of Levi Aron, aged&amp;nbsp;35, and in a dumpster in another Brooklyn neighborhood, [[Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn|Greenwood Heights]], on Wednesday morning July&amp;nbsp;13. Videos from [[Closed-circuit television|surveillance cameras]] along the boy's route showed him meeting a man outside a dentist's office and then apparently getting into his car. The dentist's reception records led police to Aron at his apartment, where he showed them parts of the boy - and told them where he had dumped the rest of the body. The kidnapping and murder of the eight-year-old boy shocked the insular Brooklyn Hasidic community, whose streets are considered relatively safe.

Aron gave a 450-word handwritten confession to police after his arrest, but pleaded not guilty at his first court hearing. Before the case went to trial, on August 9, 2012 Aron pleaded guilty to one charge of second-degree murder and one charge of second-degree kidnapping as part of a [[plea bargain]] agreement worked out between prosecutors and defense attorneys. On August 29, Judge Neil Firetog sentenced Aron to 40 years to life in prison. Aron would be eligible for [[parole]] in 2051, which includes credit for time served.

The case drew drawn comparisons to the 1979 kidnapping of six-year-old [[Etan Patz]] from nearby [[SoHo]], who was snatched while walking to his school bus for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/a-new-horror-recalls-another/ |title=A New Horror Recalls Another |last=Haberman |first=Clyde |date=14 July 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==

===Search===
Kletzky's mother called the Brooklyn South Shomrim volunteer civilian patrol to report a missing child at 6:14&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="press"/&gt; Brooklyn South Shomrim, which says it receives 10 calls of missing children per day,&lt;ref name="kilg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/in-hasidic-areas-first-call-for-help-isnt-to-911/?scp=8&amp;sq=kletzky%20video&amp;st=cse |title=For Hasidim, First Call for Help Often Isn't to 911

By 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., Shomrim contacted the New York City Police Department, which declared a Level 1 search, something normally undertaken after a child is missing for 24 hours.

Meanwhile, Yaakov German, a [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobover]] Hasid and father of Kletzky's yeshiva rebbi,&lt;ref name="press"/&gt; went door-to-door on Tuesday morning with his son to examine videos from surveillance cameras posted in stores and offices along the boy's route. The videos showed that after leaving his school at 1205 44th Street, between 12th and 13th Avenues, at about 5:05&amp;nbsp;p.m., Kletzky missed his turn at 13th Avenue and continued down 44th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/07/15/2011-07-15_i_just_cant_stand_to_see_something_like_this_happening_in_our_community_how_his_.html |title=Amateur sleuth Yaakov German helps cops catch Levi Aron and solve murder of Leiby Kletzky

On 18th Avenue, the boy was seen talking to a man who then crossed the street and entered a dentist's office. When the man came out, Kletzky followed him and appeared to get into his car.&lt;ref name="press"/&gt;

After examining the videos, police located the dentist, who alerted his receptionist, the wife of community political operative [[Simcha Eichenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaer, Matthew (December 4, 2011) [https://www.nymag.com/news/features/levi-aron-2011-12/index4.html "A Monster Among the 'Frum'"], ''New York Magazine''.

Eichenstein sent it to his wife, at home with her small children. “Of course,” she told her husband. She couldn’t remember the man’s name, but she was sure she had seen him. “He came in to pay a bill. He was the last one in the office."&lt;/ref&gt; She gave them the name and address of the suspect who had come in to pay his bill that day.&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt; After midnight on Tuesday, police also managed to identify the car in the surveillance video as a 1990 gold Honda Accord.&lt;ref name="irish"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Irish-American-cop-cracked-murder-of-8-year-old-Brooklyn-boy-Leiby-Kletzky-126055488.html |title=Irish American cop cracked murder of 8-year-old Brooklyn boy Leiby Kletzky

===Confession===
According to a 450-word handwritten statement in which he confessed to killing the boy, Aron claimed that Kletzky had asked him for directions and accepted a ride, saying he wanted to be dropped off at a bookstore. Aron suggested that they drive together to a wedding in [[Monsey, New York]]; they returned around 11:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. Aron claimed that he planned to return the boy to his family on Tuesday, but when he saw the missing child posters the next day, he said he "panicked", returned to the apartment, and smothered the boy with a towel. Then he dismembered the body and stuffed it into bags, which he placed in a suitcase and left in a dumpster in another neighborhood.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/07/14/national/main20079404.shtml |title=NYC boy spent hours with suspect before murder |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011 |publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yeshiva"/&gt;

A video from the security camera at the Ateres Charna wedding hall in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] confirmed that Aron was at the wedding, but no sign is seen of Kletzky.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304521304576446433004865952 |title=Suspect Recounts Time With Child |last1=Gardiner |first1=Sean |last2=Hollander |first2=Sophia |date=15 July 2011 |accessdate=1 August 2011 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A color surveillance video taken later that night at a [[Sunoco]] gas station on the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] showed Aron and Kletzky getting out of Aron's car and going into the bathroom.

There was no evidence that the victim had been sexually abused.&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt; Aron was unknown to Kletzky before meeting the boy on the street.&lt;ref name="yeshiva"/&gt; Child abductions by strangers are extremely rare in New York State, with none of the 20,000 children who went missing in 2010 having been taken by a stranger, according to state statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com./article/SB10001424052702304911104576444431957206902.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Missing Brooklyn Boy Found Dead: 8-Year-Old Was Victim of 'Totally Random' Abduction |first1=Sean |last1=Gardiner |first2=Eileen |last2=Markey |first3=Andrew |last3=Grossman |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perpetrator==
Levi Aron is an Orthodox Jew&lt;ref name="name"/&gt; who grew up in Brooklyn. His father, Jack,&lt;ref name=inbred/&gt; works at the Hasidic-owned B&amp;H Photo in Brooklyn;&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; his mother, Basya,&lt;ref name=inbred/&gt; died five or six years previously.&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; Aron lived in the attic apartment of his parents' three-family home on the corner of Avenue C and East 2nd Street in the Kensington neighborhood. He was married twice; in 2004 he married Diana Diunov, an Israeli woman, and in 2007 he married Deborah M. Parnell of [[Tennessee]], a divorced mother of two whom he had met online and with whom he moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], where he worked as a security guard. Both marriages ended in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/nyregion/suspect-pleads-not-guilty-in-leiby-kletzkys-death-and-offers-account.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion |title=Police Sort Through Suspect's Account as He Pleads Not Guilty in Killing |last1=Barron |first1=James |last2=Baker |first2=Al |work=The New York Times |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aron worked as a clerk at a hardware-supply company in Brooklyn. He was described by his coworkers as quiet and socially awkward.&lt;ref name="local"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/07/13/co-workers-suspect-in-leiby-kletzky-murder-acted-normal-during-investigation/ |title=Acquaintances: Suspect In Leiby Kletzky Murder Showed No Warning Signs |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2011 |publisher=CBS New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aron had injured his head when he was hit by a car while riding his bike at the age of 9 and suffered problems stemming from that accident. It is believed that this caused extreme shyness and neurotic behaviors with Aron in later life.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; He had no prior arrest record. He had been served with an Order of Protection in January 2007 and had received a fine for a seat belt violation and one speeding ticket. In Brooklyn, authorities cited a summons for public urination.&lt;ref name="Ya'ar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/145716 |title=Who is Levi Aron, Accused Killer of Leiby Kletzky? |date=14 July 2011 |last=Ya'ar |first=Chana |publisher=Arutz Sheva |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==

===Defense attorneys' statements===
Aron appeared in Brooklyn Criminal Court on July 14, 2011, and pleaded not guilty. At the hearing, his lawyer stated that Aron "suffers from hallucinations" and "hears voices".&lt;ref name="Prokupecz"/&gt; The court ordered Aron to be sent to the prison ward at [[Bellevue Hospital Center]] for a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/breaking_news/kletzky_murder_suspect_bellevue_psychiatric_tests |title=Kletzky Murder Suspect In Bellevue For Psychiatric Tests |last=Magnus |first=Cynthia |date=15 July 2011 |accessdate=17 July 2011 |work=Jewish Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Aron had been hospitalized, his lawyers stated that he was "seeking to quiet the voices in his head by listening to music". They also described his demeanor as "abnormal".&lt;ref name="Prokupecz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/125761373.html |title=Accused Killer Quiets Voices in Head With Music, Lawyers Say |first1=Jonathan |last1=Dienst |first2=Shimon |last2=Prokupecz |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=18 July 2011 |publisher=[[NBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, another of Aron's attorneys, Howard Greenberg, sparked outrage when he remarked of his client, "Look, everybody knows when blood relations have offspring, there can be genetic defects... There's inbreeding in that community" &amp;ndash; the latter referring to the Hasidic Jewish community of New York City.&lt;ref name=inbred&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/inbred_outrage_94xSKANEEIE5BmhY4Z1rCJ|title='Inbred' Outrage |first=Jose|last=Martinez|work=New York Post|date=22 December 2011|accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopsy findings===
On July 20, 2011, the [[Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York|office of the New York City medical examiner]] released autopsy results revealing that Kletzky had ingested a lethal mix of four different drugs and had then been [[Asphyxia#Smothering|smothered]]. The cause of death was determined to be intoxication from a combination of [[cyclobenzaprine]] (a [[muscle relaxant]]), [[quetiapine]] (an [[antipsychotic]]), and [[hydrocodone]] and [[Paracetamol|acetaminophen]] (two [[analgesic]]s), followed by smothering. Upon release of the autopsy results, the case was officially ruled a [[homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/07/20/general-us-missing-boy_8575270.html |title=Kidnapped NYC boy was given drugs, then smothered |author=Associated Press |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=20 July 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 2011, the New York City medical examiner's office revealed that Kletzky had ingested a fifth drug, [[Duloxetine]], which is used for [[generalized anxiety disorder]] and as an [[antidepressant]]. The blood tests revealing this drug took a few weeks to process at an outside lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/General+News/99555/EXCLUSIVE%3A-Blood-Tests-Reveal-5th-Drug-Was-Given-To-Leiby-Kletzy-Before-Being-Killed.html |title=EXCLUSIVE: Blood Tests Reveal 5th Drug Was Given To Leiby Kletzy Before Being Killed |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2011 |work=Yeshiva World News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indictment===
Hours after the autopsy results were released on July 20, a Brooklyn [[grand jury]] indicted Aron on eight counts of murder and kidnapping &amp;ndash; including two counts of [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees of murder in the United States|first-degree murder]], three counts of second-degree murder, two counts of first-degree kidnapping, and one count of second-degree kidnapping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/143295/leiby-kletzky-s-accused-killer-indicted-on-felony-murder-charges/ |title=Leiby Kletzky's Accused Killer Indicted on Felony Murder Charges |last=Anderson |first=Tetiana |work=NY1 |date=July 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004191855/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/143295/leiby-kletzky-s-accused-killer-indicted-on-felony-murder-charges/ |archivedate=October 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; – which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/nyregion/leiby-kletzky-was-drugged-before-being-suffocated-official-says.html |title=Brooklyn 8-Year-Old Was Drugged, Then Suffocated, Medical Examiner Says

A day after the indictment was handed down, one of Aron's lawyers, Gerard Marrone, resigned from the case, saying that he could not represent the defendant as "the allegations were too horrific". Attorney Jennifer McCann joined Pierre Bazile for the defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903461104576462632375189412 |title=Defense Shifts in Kletzky Murder |date=23 July 2011 |accessdate=23 July 2011 |last=Gardiner |first=Sean |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8262876 |title=Attorneys of suspect in Leiby Kletzky murder quits |date=22 July 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2011 |publisher=WABC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was prosecuted by the Kings County (Brooklyn) District Attorney's Office. The lead prosecutor was veteran Assistant District Attorney Julie B. Rendelman of the Homicide Bureau. Ms. Rendelman was the attorney who successfully prosecuted Horace Moore for the stabbing murder of NYC bus driver Edwin Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/10/07/man-found-guilty-in-bus-drivers-stabbing-death/ |title=News Man Found Guilty In Bus Driver's Stabbing Death|date=7 October 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2013 |publisher=WCBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also assigned to the case was Assistant District Attorney Linda Weinman.

===Arraignment===
Aron was declared competent to stand trial in an [[arraignment]] at the New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on August 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/levi-aron-ruled-competent-for-trial-in-leiby-kletzky-murder/ |title=Levi Aron Called Fit for Trial in Leiby Kletzky Murder |last=Robbins |first=Liz |work=The New York Times |date=4 August 2011 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results of the psychiatric evaluation, obtained by [[Associated Press]], indicate that Aron was diagnosed with an [[adjustment disorder]]. The suspect was said to be "confused and apathetic", with a "'practically blank' personality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macon.com/2011/08/10/1661250/ap-exclusive-child-slaying-suspect.html |title=AP Exclusive: Child-slaying suspect has disorder |last=Long |first=Colleen |date=10 August 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2011 |work=[[Associated Press]] }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the psychologist [[Apperception|apperceived]] him as reserved, apathetic, sad and cooperative, and diagnosed a [[schizoid personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brooklyn slaying suspect has "schizoid" disorder|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/brooklyn-slaying-suspect-has-schizoid-disorder/|work=CBS News|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Crime Classification Manual: A Standard System for Investigating and Classifying Violent Crime|date=2013|isbn=1118419847|page=https://www.google.com/search?q=isbn%3A1118419847+Levi+Aron&amp;btnG=Search&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1118419847}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coscarelli|first=Joe|title=Levi Aron Has a Personality Disorder|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/08/levi_aron_has_a_personality_di.html|work=NY Mag|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details also emerged that Aron had a younger sister who died while institutionalized for [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jnPmDC0_98GUdk_dnwBo0KX3tRKQ?docId=28fdbe63dd9045dc862c3467f3bcbbe4 |title=Clarification: Dismembered Boy story |author=Associated Press |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aron was held at [[Rikers Island]] on round-the-clock [[suicide watch]]. He gave his first media interview to the ''[[New York Post]]'' on August 12, 2011. He did not refer to Kletzky by name, and kept referring to the smothering and dismembering of the boy as "the incident". He did not explain why he took and kept the boy, saying, "He looked familiar. I thought I knew him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/08/12/2011-08-12_butcher_talks_li_panicked_sez_killer_who_wont_apologize_licalls_leibys_brutal_sl.html |title=Leiby Kletzky killer Levi Aron won't apologize for brutal slaughter, calls murder 'the incident' |last=Blau |first=Reuven |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=12 August 2011 |work=[[New York Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2011, the State Supreme Court justice assigned to the case, Justice Neil J. Firetog, chided Aron's lawyers in court for discussing the case on their [[Facebook]] pages, accused them of leaking the court-ordered psychological examination to the press, and questioned their ability to handle such a complex case given their lack of experience. Pierre Bazile, who passed the bar in 2007, had defended only one homicide case, while Jennifer McCann had defended six cases, three of them ending in acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/nyregion/judge-criticizes-levi-arons-defense-lawyers.html |title=Lawyers Defending Suspect in Boy's Death Are Scolded |last=Robbins |first=Liz |work=The New York Times |date=23 August 2011 |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-questions-experience-of-defense-lawyers-in-nyc-case-of-dismembered-boy/2011/08/24/gIQA6hm8aJ_story.html |title=Judge questions experience of defense lawyers in NYC case of dismembered boy |author=Associated Press |date=24 August 2011 |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A veteran criminal defense lawyer, Howard Greenberg, subsequently joined the defense team [[pro bono]] to offset the judge's criticism of lack of experience.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/veteran-lawyer-joins-defense-team-for-trial-in-killing-of-brooklyn-boy/ |last=Robbins |first=Liz |title=Veteran Lawyer Joins Defense Team in Leiby Kletzky Case |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=24 October 2011 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-trial hearing===
On October 24, 2011, Aron appeared at a brief hearing in the State Supreme Court via video conferencing.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt; Outside the courtroom, his lawyers claimed that police forced Aron to write his 450-word confession, stating that he was not sane enough to be aware of his actions.

In November 2011, the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court denied Aron's counsel's request to move the trial to [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] or [[The Bronx]] in light of unfavorable media coverage in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/11/08/3090181/levi-aron-to-be-tried-in-brooklyn |title=Trial of Leiby Kletzky's accused killer staying in Brooklyn |date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011 |work=Forward |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113050218/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/11/08/3090181/levi-aron-to-be-tried-in-brooklyn |archivedate=November 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it reserved the right to allow the defense to re-apply for a [[change of venue]] after the jury pool was questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_man_who_allegedly_killed_boy_kNvQFF77diidBl1kcKXzwI |title=B'klyn man who allegedly killed boy will face trial in borough |last=Gorta |first=William J. |work=New York Post |date=7 November 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012 Aron appeared in court via video conferencing while his attorneys scheduled a new trial date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdEf9VjVEb4 | title=Murder Suspect Levi Aron Back In Court | work=News 12 Brooklyn | date=March 13, 2012 | accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 he appeared before the court again via videoconferencing; the video showed that he had gained at least {{convert|50|lb}} since his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_butcher_gains_at_least_pounds_jjSmc6AO0tegrFDcy2UF4L |title='B'klyn Butcher' gains at least 50 pounds at Rikers |first=Jose |last=Martinez |date=25 May 2012 |accessdate=3 July 2012 |work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plea bargain agreement===
On August 1, 2012, it was reported that prosecutors had struck a deal with the defense in which Aron would plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of at least 40 years to life in prison.&lt;ref name="expect"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/nyregion/levi-aron-expected-to-plead-guilty-to-killing-leiby-kletzky.html | title=Guilty Plea Is Expected in the Killing of Brooklyn Boy, 8 |first=Mosi |last=Secret| work=The New York Times | date=August 1, 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kletzky family supported this decision, wanting to avoid reliving the murder if the case went to trial.&lt;ref name="expect"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/08/09/brooklyn-man-sentenced-to-in-boys-murder/ |title=Brooklyn Man Pleads Guilty in Boy's Murder |first=Pervais |last=Shallwani |date=August 9, 2012 |accessdate=August 9, 2012 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9, 2012, Aron changed his plea to guilty of one charge of second-degree murder and one charge of second-degree kidnapping at Brooklyn Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/nyregion/levi-aron-is-sentenced-to-40-years-in-killing-of-leiby-kletzky-8.html |title=Man Who Killed and Dismembered a Lost Boy, 8, Gets 40 Years to Life|first=C.J. |last=Hughes |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=2 September 2012 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He answered a series of questions from the judge in which he admitted to killing Leiby Kletzky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8767192 |title=Levi Aron Pleads Guilty in Leiby Kletzky Murder |date=August 9, 2012 |accessdate=August 9, 2012 |work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 29, 2012, Judge Neil Firetog sentenced Aron to 25 years to life on the second-degree murder charge and 15 years to life on the second-degree kidnapping charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/leiby_monster_put_away_B0fTdbXKL3RvWFtVpXv35K |title=Levi Aron sentenced to 40 years to life for murder of Orthodox Jewish boy Leiby Kletzky |first1=Josh |last1=Saul |first2=Antonio |last2=Antenucci |first3=Leonard |last3=Greene|work=New York Post |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aron would be eligible for [[parole]] in 2051, which includes credit for time served.&lt;ref name="sentence"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/08/29/brooklyn-man-sentenced-to-40-years-in-boys-killing/ |title=Brooklyn Man Sentenced to 40 Years in Boy's Killing |first1=Pervaiz |last1=Shallwani |first2=Tania |last2=Karas |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil lawsuits===
On August 17, 2011, Nachman Kletzky filed a $100 million civil lawsuit against Aron in Brooklyn Supreme Court, seeking damages for the "abduction, kidnapping, torture, murder and dismemberment" of his son. On August 23, Kletzky filed a $100 million civil suit against Aron's father, Jack, for neglecting to monitor his son or protect Leiby while the latter was in his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904332804576538933681883412?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Victim's Parents Sue Alleged Killer |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 30, 2011 |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |last=Shallwani |first=Pervaiz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/29/slain-boys-father-sues-accused-killer-and-his-father/ |last=Robbins |first=Liz |work=The New York Times |date= August 29, 2011 |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |title=Slain Boy's Father Sues Accused Killer and His Father}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed legislation==

{{Anchor|Leiby's Initiative}}In the wake of the murder, State Assemblymen [[Dov Hikind]] and [[Peter Abbate]] and [[New York State Senate|State Senator]] [[Diane Savino]] said they would introduce a bill called "Leiby's Initiative", which would grant a $500 annual [[tax credit]] to any [[New York City]] property owner who installs and maintains surveillance cameras on their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/07/15/lawmakers-propose-tax-credit-for-surveillance-camera-installation-after-brooklyn-tragedy/ |title='Leiby's Initiative': Lawmakers To Propose $500 Tax Credit For Surveillance Camera Installation |publisher=CBS New York |date=July 15, 2011 |accessdate=July 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Leiby's Law}}New York City Councilman [[David G. Greenfield|David Greenfield]] has said he would propose "Leiby's Law," a bill under which businesses could volunteer to be designated as safe places for children who are lost or otherwise in trouble. Employees would undergo background checks and business owners would put a green sticker in their store windows so children know it is a safe place to get help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/07/21/2011-07-21_leibys_law_would_provide_safe_places_for_children_who_are_lost_or_in_trouble.html |title='Leiby's Law' would provide safe places for children who are lost or in trouble |publisher=NY Daily News |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 16, 2011, the Brooklyn District Attorney's office announced a similar program called "Safe Stop". So far, 76 stores have signed up to display a green "Safe Haven" sticker in their windows to help lost children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2011/08/17/2011-08-17_safe_haven_for_kids_storeowners_to_post_signs_on_windows.html |title=Storeowners post 'Safe Stop' signs on windows to help lost kids |last=Rizzo |first=Lillian |date= August 17, 2011 |accessdate= August 18, 2011 |work=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|The Leiby Kletzky Security Initiative}}In September 2013, Assemblyman Dov Hikind and [[Majority Leader of the New York State Senate|State Senate Majority Leader]] [[Dean Skelos]] announced the implementation of the Leiby Kletzky Security Initiative, which will provide the installation of 100 security cameras on public lampposts throughout the [[Midwood, Brooklyn|Midwood]] and Borough Park neighborhoods. Paid for by a $1 million state grant, the cameras will be maintained by Secure Watch 24, a private security firm and [[Limited liability company|LLC]] controlled by [[Agudath Israel of America]].

{{anchor|"Leiby Forever" song}}In early August, Hasidic singer [[Lipa Schmeltzer]] released a ballad called "Leiby Forever" and a seven-minute music video showing home movies of Kletzky growing up.

'''Niels Christian Hertzberg''' (16 January 1941 - 1 March 2013) was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] sports official.

He was the secretary-general of the [[Norwegian Handball Federation]] from 1984 to 2003. He was credited as having the strongest influence on the development of the Norwegian Handball Federation. He was also married to former national team coach for women, [[Marit Breivik]]. He died in March 2013 in their vacation home in Brazil, most probably from a fall accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Niels Hertzberg er død|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=2 March 2013|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Politiet: - Ingen tegn til at Hertzberg ble drept|agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]]|date=4 April 2013|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Niels Christian Hertzberg|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=23 March 2013|author=Johannessen, Karl-Arne|authorlink=Karl-Arne Johannessen|author2=Langerud, Erik |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-fatal offences against the person''',  under [[English law]], are generally taken to mean offences which take the form of an attack directed at another person, that do not result in the death of any person. Such offences where death occurs are considered [[Homicide in English law|homicide]], whilst [[Sexual offences in the United Kingdom|sexual offences]] are generally considered separately, since they differ substantially from other offences against the person in theoretical basis and composition. Non-fatal offences against the person mainly derive from the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], although no definition of assault or battery is given there.

[[Offences against the person]] include minor forms of [[battery (crime)|battery]] (any unlawful touching of another person); its complimentary offence, [[assault]] (causing the apprehension of a battery, even when one has not yet occurred); and various more serious offences which are based on assault and battery (together called "common assault"). This includes [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]], where the victim suffers injuries such as bruising or skin abrasions (the converse being an injury that is "transient and trifling"); wounding (a piercing of all layers of the skin); and causing grievous bodily harm (injuries more serious than in actual bodily harm, for example broken bones). The latter two offences may be committed "with intent", meaning there is an additional ''[[mens rea]]'' component that makes the defendant more culpable for their actions. Whilst [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] is sufficient for most offences against the person &amp;ndash; that the defendant foresaw the risk of the proscribed injury occurring without necessarily intending it to happen &amp;ndash; this is insufficient for crimes of intent.

==General characteristics==
[[File:Non-fatal offences against the person graph.png|thumb|right|250px|Number of recorded crimes (2009&amp;ndash;10). Categories approximate non-fatal offences against the person.]]
Common to all crimes against the person is the infringement of the right to [[bodily integrity]]. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no [[harm principle|physical harm]] actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the [[right to liberty]].&lt;ref name="simester425"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the [[right to privacy]] under Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="simester425"/&gt; The central statute on this topic is [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.&lt;ref name="simester425"/&gt;

In the context of the [[inchoate offences in English law|law of attempts]], the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] advises that "where the evidence demonstrates that the suspect intended to cause an injury that is substantially more serious than that (if any) which was in fact caused, prosecutors should consider the circumstances of the case as a whole as well as the relevant sentencing guideline to determine the appropriate charge." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/ |title=Offences Against The Person |accessdate=5 July 2013 |publisher=Crown Prosecution Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assault and battery==
A distinction is drawn between the offence of [[assault]] and that of [[battery (crime)|battery]]. Assault is the ''apprehension'' of the possibility of immediate unlawful violence, and battery that of the ''infliction'' of such violence. Several proposals, including one from the [[Criminal Law Revision Committee]] in 1980 have proposed merging the offences. However, the distinction was confirmed in ''[[DPP v Little]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1992] QB 645 (DC)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992. There, the [[conflation]] of assault and battery was criticised as [[Duplicity (law)|duplicitous]].&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith412"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; If D throws a punch at V, who dodges, this is likely to be an assault but not a battery; if V is attacked from behind, this may constitute a battery without an assault.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 426&amp;ndash;427.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith413"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt; Actions which constitute ordinary daily life are not considered assault or battery, for example, jostling on a crowded train.&lt;ref name="simester428"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "common assault" is used to refer to either a technical assault or a battery.&lt;ref name="smith412"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cpscharging"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/#P92_3540 |title=Offences against the Person, incorporating the Charging Standard |publisher=[[Crown Prosecution Service]] |year=2009 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assault===
{{main|Common assault}}
Assault is a [[summary offence]] in England and Wales, with the case heard only at a [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]].&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith415"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''R v Little'' considered assault a statutory offence, none of the statutes referred to contain any definition of assault.&lt;ref name="smith413"/&gt; The ''[[actus reus]]'', endorsed in ''[[R v Ireland]]'',&lt;ref name="ireland" group="c"&gt;[1998] AC 147&lt;/ref&gt; is any act by D that causes V to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 427&amp;ndash;428.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "force" rather than "violence" is used by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS).&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt; As a definition, this has proven stable, but its interpretation has varied.&lt;ref name="simester428"/&gt; The force must be unlawful &amp;ndash; outside the realm of [[Self-defence in English law|defensive]] or preventative force, for example. Consent of the victim may be enough to prevent the commission of a crime. There is to debate as to whether lack of consent is an element of the ''actus reus'', making it inherent to the commission of a crime, or whether consent is a defence. [[Andrew Simester]] and [[Bob Sullivan (legal writer)|Bob Sullivan]] argue that the former is more correct, since lack on consent is vital to the crime; since the act may not constitute a harm even if enacted. The disregard for the victim's [[autonomy]] and privacy is the actionable part of the offence.&lt;ref name="simester428"/&gt; The victim need not be frightened by the apprehension of violence, merely not want the person concerned to do it.&lt;ref name="simester429"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault requires a positive act, not an [[omission (criminal law)|omission]]. Mere lawful presence in a location is not enough to satisfy the conduct requirement; illegal [[trespass to land|trespass]], however, is sufficient.&lt;ref name="simester429"/&gt; [[John Cyril Smith]] has suggested that wilfully refusing to retract an inadvertent act that causes the victim to apprehend violence may constitute an assault by omission.&lt;ref name="smith415"/&gt; It is arguable that there was once a rule that "mere words" could not constitute an assault, but the case of ''R v Ireland'' confirmed that even silent phone calls would be grounds for the charge of assault.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 429&amp;ndash;430.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elliott139"&gt;Elliott, Quinn (2006). p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[R. v Constanza]]'' added threatening letters to this category.&lt;ref name="elliott139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester430"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although assault involves a threat of an immediate battery, the perpetrator need not actually intend to carry out that battery.&lt;ref name="smith414"/&gt; It is enough that he, intentionally or recklessly, caused the victim to apprehend such an occurrence.&lt;ref name="simester430"/&gt; The term "immediate" has also been used in different ways. Following ''Ireland'', it seems likely that even where the victim knew the defendant was some distance away, this may be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Quinn (2006). p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Lord Steyn]] said there, "what, if not the possibility of imminent personal violence, was the victim terrified about?".&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 430&amp;ndash;431.&lt;/ref&gt; This would widen the crime of assault considerably. It is perfectly conceivable that the victim was fearful, but did not believe an attack was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; That she actually apprehended "immediate violence", rather than merely "immediately apprehended", is doubtful.&lt;ref name="smith414"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Constanza'', it was sufficient for the prosecution to show that the victim feared an attack in the future, which may have been imminent. It also suggested that the anticipated harm could be psychological rather than physical.&lt;ref name="elliott142"&gt;Elliott, Quinn (2006). p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Blake v Barnard]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;(1840) 9 C &amp; P 626; 173 [[English Reports|ER]] 985&lt;/ref&gt; established a rule that conditional threats could not amount to an assault. However, the court's reliance on ''[[Tuberville v Savage]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;(1669) 1 Mod Rep 3; 86 ER 684&lt;/ref&gt; was tenuous at best. Such threats would normally be considered assault.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 431&amp;ndash;432.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''mens rea'' requirement is that the defendant must have intend to, or recklessly, cause the victim to fear the possibility of immediate unlawful violence.&lt;ref name="simester432"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no authority that suggests that "intend" or "recklessly" ought to mean something from their normal meanings. ''[[Recklessness (law)|Cunningham recklessness]]'' &amp;ndash; that the defendant himself foresaw the risk of harm &amp;ndash; is applied.&lt;ref name="elliott142"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester432"/&gt; Assault is a crime of "basic intent" for the purposes of the [[Majewski test]] concerning [[Voluntary intoxication in English law|voluntary intoxication]].&lt;ref name="simester432"/&gt;

===Battery===
The defendant commits a [[Battery (crime)|battery]] if they intentionally or recklessly apply unlawful force to another, without their consent.&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester432"/&gt; It is subject to the same "everyday life" exception common to assault.&lt;ref name="simester432"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith416"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Cases have included kissing,&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Dungey (1864) 4 F&amp;F 99, 102; 176 ER 487&lt;/ref&gt; spitting&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Smith (1866) F&amp;F 1066; 176 ER 910&lt;/ref&gt; and cutting someone's hair without their consent.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Smith [2006] EWHC 94 (admin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 432&amp;ndash;433.&lt;/ref&gt; This also includes contact with the victim's clothing,&lt;ref name="simester433"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; a rule dating back to 1845 in ''[[R v Day]]''. It is not necessary that the victim feels the touching.&lt;ref name="smith416"/&gt;

The required [[causation (law)|causation]] may be quite oblique. As well as weaponry held in the hand, weaponry thrown is included, as is causing people to touch each other by creating a sense of panic.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Martin (1881) 8 QBD 54 (CCR)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simester433"/&gt; The general law on [[Omissions in English criminal law|liability for omissions]] also applies to batteries, for example those of the continuing act (as in ''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner|Fagan v MPC]]'') and of a [[duty of care]].&lt;ref name="simester433"/&gt; However, in ''R v Ireland''&lt;ref name="ireland" group="c"/&gt; the court ruled out psychological injury by means of a telephone as a form of battery, although it was not an important point in the case as other charges were brought.&lt;ref name="simester433"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith417"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; Poisoning is not a battery where there is no accompanying violence.&lt;ref name="smith417"/&gt;

The case of ''[[R v Brown]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1994] 1 AC 212&lt;/ref&gt; established a further requirement: hostility. This is not easily called an ''actus reus'' nor ''mens rea'' requirement. It was not clear what role it played in that case, but could apply to other cases as a way of clarifying the "everyday behaviour" guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been strongly criticised by [[Lord Goff]] and other judicial and academic writers. It could apply to future cases where the bodily harm was unintended or unforeseen.&lt;ref name="simester435"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''mens rea'' requirement for battery is similar to assault. It is the intention to apply unlawful force to another, or be reckless as to whether such force is applied.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; It employs ''[[Recklessness (law)|Cunningham recklessness]]'' &amp;ndash; that the defendant must have foreseen the risk of the infliction of unlawful force upon V.&lt;ref name="simester435"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). pp. 418&amp;ndash;419.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, at least, combining the ''mens rea'' of battery with the ''actus reus'' of assault, or vice versa, is not a crime.&lt;ref name="smith419"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Majewski test]] is applied to cases of voluntary intoxication, as battery is also a crime of "basic intent" in this scenario.&lt;ref name="simester435"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith419"/&gt;

==Assault occasioning actual bodily harm==
[[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] carries a maximum sentence of 5 years under section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.&lt;ref name="simester435"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/47 |title=Offences Against the Person Act 1861: Section 47 |work=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[triable either way]].&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith436"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; Both assault (fear of violence) and battery (infliction of violence) are included,&lt;ref name="simester436"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is possible to consider section 47 as creating two offences &amp;ndash; one involving an assault, and one a battery.&lt;ref name="smith436"/&gt; "Occasioning" is generally taken to mean "causing" although [[John Gardner (lawyer)|John Gardner]] has argued that it is wider than that.&lt;ref name="simester436"/&gt; In discussing causation, 'frightened' people are not expected to act entirely rationally; instead, a relevant test is that of ''[[R v Roberts]]''.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;56 Cr App R 95 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt; There, any conduct of the victim short of "daft" could be considered caused by the defendant's actions.&lt;ref name="simester436"/&gt; Only the seriousness of the injury separates an assault from an assault occasioning actual bodily harm.&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt;

The concept of "actual bodily harm" is wide. Almost all injuries are included &amp;ndash; for example, [[bruising]] or [[Abrasion (medical)|skin abrasion]]s. Injuries are not included if they are "transient or trifling",&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Donovan [1934] 2 KB 498 CCA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt; but this did not cover even momentary unconsciousness.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;T v DPP [2003] EWHC 266 (admin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simester436"/&gt; The wide range of injuries give prosecutors considerable discretion about which charge to bring against a defendant.&lt;ref name="simester436"/&gt; Psychological injury is included,&lt;ref name="smith437"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; so long as it forms a recognised medical condition.&lt;ref name="simester436437"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 436&amp;ndash;437.&lt;/ref&gt; Mere fright or anxiety is insufficient for actual bodily harm.&lt;ref name="smith437"/&gt; It is limited only by the need for an actual assault or battery to have taken place.&lt;ref name="simester436437"/&gt;

There is no separate ''mens rea'' element from the assault or battery, making this a crime of [[constructive liability]].&lt;ref name="smith436"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester437"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been defended by John Gardner, a proponent of the [[moral threshold]] theory.&lt;ref name="simester437"/&gt; However, this is opposed by Simester and Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 437&amp;ndash;438.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maliciously wounds or inflicts grievous bodily harm==
{{main|Grievous bodily harm}}
Section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 criminalises "whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously wound or inflict any grievous bodily harm upon any other person, either with or without any weapon or instrument".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/20 |title=Offences Against the Person Act 1861: Section 20 |work=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty, five years, is the same as that for actual bodily harm, but a section 20 offence is considered more serious by the courts and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]].&lt;ref name="simester438"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt; A judge is free on the facts of the case to allow a jury find a defendant guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm where a defendant is charged with a section 20 offence.&lt;ref name="smith438"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''actus reus'' is the wound or infliction of grievous bodily harm (GBH). A "wound" is something that breaks all layers of the [[skin]], and must have an external component &amp;ndash; [[internal bleeding]], however serious, is not a wound.&lt;ref name="simster438439"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 438&amp;ndash;439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith439"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; Serious wounds would also fall under grievous bodily harm, but some qualifying wounds (a pin prick, for example) are very minor.&lt;ref name="simster438439"/&gt; Some wounds would therefore not qualify as grievous bodily harm.&lt;ref name="smith439"/&gt;

The phrase "really serious harm" was used to describe grievous bodily harm in ''R v Metheram''.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1961] 3 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simester438"/&gt; The case of ''R v Grundy''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1977] Crim LR 543&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that injuries should be taken in their totality; that many small injuries may form a serious harm.&lt;ref name="simster438439"/&gt; ''R v Bollom''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[2004] 2 Cr App R 50&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed the ''Grundy'' approach, and also showed that grievous bodily harm against a child was likely to require less bodily harm than that against an adult. ''[[R v Burstow]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1998] AC 147&lt;/ref&gt; extended "bodily harm" to include psychological trauma if it formed a recognised serious mental condition. Simester ''et al'' said that this could have wide-reaching consequences, but it is unlikely to be taken to include commonplace occurrences (relationship breakups, verbal cruelty, broken promises) &amp;ndash; in ''Burstow'', the conduct included a prolonged and intense campaign of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time, ''[[R v Clarence]]'' was taken as an authority on the meaning of "inflict", which the court took to mean "an assault or battery of which a wound or grievous bodily harm is the manifest immediate and obvious result".&lt;ref group="c"&gt;(1888) 22 QBD 23&lt;/ref&gt; This narrow definition was extended in ''R v Martin''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;(1881) 8 QBD 54&lt;/ref&gt; and ''R v Halliday''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1886&amp;ndash;90] All ER 1028&lt;/ref&gt; to include, for example, injuries sustained during an attempt of the victim to flee.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; An injury is said to be "inflicted" if it is the result of an impact or percussion set in motion by the defendant; the injury must relate directly to the impact or percussion, but the impact or percussion may be an indirect effect of the defendant's actions.&lt;ref name="simester441"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; ''R v Burstow'' established that "inflict" was a near synonym of cause: in [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope]]'s view, they were synonymous, except that the outcome of the former must be unpleasant.&lt;ref name="smith441"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; This was applied in ''[[R v Dica]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[2004] QB 1257&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[R v Konzani]]'',&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[2005] EWCA Crim 706&lt;/ref&gt; two cases of [[Criminal transmission of HIV|knowingly risking passing on HIV]] without explicit consent.&lt;ref name="simester441"/&gt;

The ''mens rea'' element is that of "malice", which means either intention or recklessness.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 441&amp;ndash;442.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cunningham recklessness'' is applied.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Savage [1992] 1 AC 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith441"/&gt; However, for the purposes of recklessness, foresight of even minor harm is sufficient &amp;ndash; it does not require foresight of serious harm.&lt;ref name="smith441"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester442"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been criticised since it breaks the correspondence principle, that the ''mens rea'' should match the ''actus reus'' of an offence.&lt;ref name="simester442"/&gt;

==Wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent==
The crime of [[Grievous bodily harm#Section 18|wounding with intent]] is created by section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. It reads, since amended, as:
"Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously by any means whatsoever wound or cause any grievous bodily harm to any person... with intent...  to do some...  grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist or prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any person...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/18 |title=Offences Against the Person Act 1861: Section 18 |work=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates four forms of the offence: unlawfully and maliciously wounding, with intent to either do grievous bodily harm (1) or resist arrest (2); and unlawfully and maliciously causing grievous bodily harm, with intent to either do grievous bodily harm (3) or resist arrest (4).&lt;ref name="simester442"/&gt; Thus forms (1) and (3) differ from section 20 offences mainly in that there is a specific intention to cause serious harm rather than some harm, and they are therefore the more serious charges. On an [[indictment]] under section 18, the jury is open to convict under section 20 or section 47 if properly directed.&lt;ref name="smith438"/&gt;

"Wounding" and "causing grievous bodily harm" are defined in the same way as they are in the crime of maliciously wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm. Grievous bodily harm includes serious psychological trauma and serious infection; however, these are less controversial here because of the inclusion of intent.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 442&amp;ndash;443.&lt;/ref&gt; Intent narrows the crime considerably, and the term "inflict" is not used.&lt;ref name="simester443"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; In form (3), intent can be simply decided in the case of a direct attack, or "virtual certainty", with knowledge of the virtual certainty &amp;ndash; the ''[[R v Woollin|Woollin]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Woollin [1999] AC 82 (HL)&lt;/ref&gt; principle.&lt;ref name="simester443"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; In form (1), where an injury does not amount to grievous bodily harm, intent to cause grievous bodily harm (in the advancement of a different cause) must be shown. Practically, the "virtual certainty" clause cannot come into force, since grievous bodily harm was not actually caused, by definition.&lt;ref name="simester443"/&gt; In forms (2) and (4), the concept of "malice" has a role to play that it does not in (1) and (3). The defendant must foresee the risk of wounding or grievous bodily harm, where the core intent is to resist arrest. The defendant cannot be reckless to the resisting of arrest, it must be an intention.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 443&amp;ndash;444.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the requirement to resist a ''lawful'' arrest, the defendant only lacks the required ''mens rea'' if he believes in facts which, if true, would make the arrest unlawful; not just that he believes the facts as they are make the arrest illegal &amp;ndash; a [[mistake of fact]] suffices, a [[mistake of law]] does not.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other offences and issues==
There also exist alternative forms of aggravated assault in English law, for example: assault or battery with intent to resist arrest (as above, the arrest must be lawful); and assault on, resistance to, and obstruction of [[constable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). pp. 426&amp;ndash;436.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], it is also possible to commit a racially aggravated assault. This is where the commission of the assault in combination to hostility towards the victim, based on their race or believed race, or association with a race. "Race" includes skin colour, nationality, citizenship, and ethnic or national origins.&lt;ref name="smith437"/&gt; Administering poison, either contrary to section 23 or 24 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, is also an offence; as is false imprisonment &amp;ndash; including unlawful arrest, kidnap and hostage situations.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). pp. 443&amp;ndash;457.&lt;/ref&gt;  Legislation aimed at the possession or use of firearms may also come into this category, as may [[bomb hoax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). pp.457&amp;ndash;465.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also offences of aggravated assault, created under the Offences against the Person Act 1861, that now go almost completely unused: for example, assaulting or obstructing a clergyman in the discharge of his duties, and assaulting a [[magistrate]] or other person in the exercise of his duties concerning the preservation of a vessel in distress or a wreck.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;

An assault is not caused if a defendant threatens to shoot the victim, but the victim is aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, it would be the ''actus reus'' of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for [[attempted assault]]. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.&lt;ref name="smith415"/&gt;

'''Osterby Man''' or the '''Osterby Head''' ({{lang-da|Østerbymanden}}) is a [[bog body]] of which only the skull and hair survive. It was discovered in 1948 by [[peat]] cutters to the southeast of [[Osterby, Rendsburg-Eckernförde|Osterby]], Germany. The hair is tied in a [[Suebian knot]]. The head is at the State Archaeological Museum at [[Gottorf Castle]] in [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein]].

==Find circumstances==
The head was discovered on 26 May 1948 by Otto and Max Müller of Osterby, who were cutting peat on their father's land, at {{coord|54|26|51|N|09|46|09|E}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kersten]], "Ein Moorleichenfund von Osterby bei Eckernförde", ''Offa. Berichte und Mitteilungen zur Urgeschichte, Frühgeschichte und Mittelalterarchäologie'' 8 (1949) 1&amp;ndash;2, p. 1, Fig. 1 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found approximately {{convert|65|to|70|cm|ftin}} beneath the current ground level. The head was wrapped in fragments of a deerskin cape, which Max Müller noticed protruding from the peat. The find was reported to the museum in Schleswig; despite intensive searching by the brothers and others, no more of the body has been found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Glob|P. V. Glob]], tr. [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]], ''[[The Bog People|The Bog People: Iron-Age Man Preserved]]'', 1971, repr. New York: New York Review Books, 2004, {{ISBN|9781590170908}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5e0tkA6gGT8C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Osterby+Man&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5Jt5UrGcN8iWiAKzg4CYDQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Osterby%20Man&amp;f=false p. 116].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and analysis==
The skull was wrapped in fragments of a deerskin cape and had been damaged by striking with a blunt object before being sunk in the bog.

===Anthropology===
The skull had been broken into several pieces. The acids in the bog have decalcified the bone, which has shrunk somewhat and is dark brown. The hair and small sections of scalp are well preserved,&lt;ref&gt;James M. Deem, ''Bodies from the Bog'', Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1998, {{ISBN|9780395857847}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DppwAMTs5skC&amp;pg=PT9&amp;lpg=PT9&amp;dq=osterby+head&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A6t3sS8G1F&amp;sig=62P8wsbSoXag0qEhe8-AAhIcXRQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PuPlSeK3BtPonQfL7sCyCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPT9,M1 n.p.]&lt;/ref&gt; but the skin and other soft tissues of the face have disappeared. There is a large wound on the left side of the head, which may have been fatal: the skull had been depressed by a blow with a blunt object over an area approximately {{convert|12|cm|in}} in diameter, and the bone of the left temple was shattered with splinters penetrating the brain area.&lt;ref name=Eternity159&gt;[[Wijnand van der Sanden]], tr. Susan J. Mellor, ''Through Nature to Eternity: The Bog Bodies of Northwest Europe'', Amsterdam: Batavian Lion, 1996, {{ISBN|9789067074186}}, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/bog/iron-09.html Osterby Man, A.D. 1-100, Found near Osterby, Germany in 1948], "The Perfect Corpse: Bog Bodies of the Iron Age", ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'', retrieved 5 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The skull had also been deformed by the weight of the peat above it, but the facial area was generally well preserved. Skeletal evidence suggests a man 50 to 60 years of age. Hack marks on the second [[cervical vertebra]] show that the head was cut off.&lt;ref name=Eternity159/&gt; The skull was stabilised for exhibition by filling with [[gypsum]].

The hair is thin and slightly wavy, {{convert|28|cm|in}} long. It has been coloured a reddish brown by the acids in the bog; microscopic analysis showed that it had been dark blond and that the man had had some white hairs.&lt;ref&gt;Glob, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5e0tkA6gGT8C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Osterby+Man&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5Jt5UrGcN8iWiAKzg4CYDQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=originally%20been%20a%20blond%20colour%2C%20not%20particularly%20light&amp;f=false p. 117].&lt;/ref&gt;  In a re-examination in 2005, [[Isotope analysis|isotopic analysis]] showed that at least during his last year of life, the man ate meat remarkably rarely, and did not eat seafood. [[Parasitology|Parasitological]] analysis of the hair showed no [[head lice]], unusual for the time.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Catherine Gill-Robinson, ''The Iron Age bog bodies of the Archaeologisches Landesmuseum, Schloss Gottorf, Schleswig, Germany'', PhD Dissertation, University of Manitoba, 2005, Ottawa: Library and Archives Canada, [2006], {{ISBN|9780494122594}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Osterby Man Suebian-Knot.jpg|thumb|Side view showing Suebian knot]]

===Hairstyle===
The hair is unusually well preserved and is tied above the right temple in a [[Suebian knot]]. [[Tacitus]] describes this in Chapter 38 of his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' as a characteristic of free men among the Germanic tribe of [[Suebi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Todd]], ''The Early Germans'', 1992, repr. Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley, 2009, {{ISBN|9781405137560}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p5QdmV3zNpIC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=Osterby+Man&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5Jt5UrGcN8iWiAKzg4CYDQ&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Osterby%20Man&amp;f=false p. 112].&lt;/ref&gt; The knot appears in several Roman depictions and on at least one other bog body, [[Dätgen Man]] (who wore his on the back of his head).&lt;ref&gt;Van der Sanden, ''Through Nature to Eternity'', p. 145; diagram of how it was tied, Ill. 202, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Osterby has featured the Suebian knot on its coat of arms since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/LA/DE/06Wappenlandschaft/0604Wappenrolle/0604Wappenrolle_node.html?Aktion=Datenblatt&amp;ID=38 Gemeinde Osterby, Kreis Rendsburg-Eckernförde] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108235005/http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/LA/DE/06Wappenlandschaft/0604Wappenrolle/0604Wappenrolle_node.html?Aktion=Datenblatt&amp;ID=38 |date=2013-11-08 }}, Kommunale Wappenrolle, State of Schleswig-Holstein State Archives {{de icon}}, retrieved 5 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skin cape===
The skull was wrapped in fragments of a garment, measuring approximately {{convert|40|by|53|cm|in}}, consisting of [[Tanning (leather)|tanned]] pieces of leather sewn together. Microscopic analysis suggested on the basis of the hairs that they were from [[roe deer]]. The neck opening was lined with a strip of leather about {{convert|1|cm|in}} wide. All seams had been sewn with small stitches in [[catgut]]. Some appeared to be repairs. Textile archaeologists identified the garment as a skin cape; similar cloaks or capes have been found with other archaeological finds, including [[Elling Woman]], [[Haraldskær Woman]], [[Dröbnitz Girl]], [[Kayhausen Boy]] and [[Jührdenerfeld Man]].

===Treatment===
Peter Löhr performed the anthropological analysis, which determined that the skull had shrunk while immersed in the bog. For his doctoral dissertation, he performed experiments on it involving repeated soaking and drying and detailed measurements; in his view, soaking caused it to swell to almost its original dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Löhr, "Die Moorleiche von Osterby. Die experimentelle Schrumpfung von Schädeln", Anthropologisches Institut der Universität Kiel, 1950 (PhD dissertation) {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Löhr's data included markedly shrunk teeth and the complete lower jaw associated with the skull, which has a protruding chin. However, more recent analysis has shown that in his original preparation of the skull for exhibition, [[Karl Schlabow]] added an unrelated lower jaw.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Brock, [http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/windeby-geheimnis-der-moorleichen-gelueftet-a-466195.html "Windeby: Geheimnis der Moorleichen gelüftet"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 17 February 2007 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating===
The Suebian knot indicates the man died in the Late [[Iron Age]] or the Roman period, and [[radiocarbon dating]] likewise indicates a date between 75 and 130 [[Common Era|CE]];&lt;ref&gt;Van der Sanden, ''Through Nature to Eternity'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johannes van der Plicht, Wijnand van der Sanden, A. T. Aerts and H. J. Streurman, [http://cio.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2004/JArchaeolScivdPlicht/2004JArchaeolScivdPlicht.pdf "Dating bog bodies by means of 14C-AMS"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917083915/http://cio.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2004/JArchaeolScivdPlicht/2004JArchaeolScivdPlicht.pdf |date=2011-09-17 }}, ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 31.4, 2004, pp. 471&amp;ndash;91, p. 480.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the hair sample used was taken from [[Alfred Dieck]]'s private collection and may thus be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;Wijnand van der Sanden, "C14-Datierungen von Moorleichen aus Niedersachsen und Schleswig-Holstein", ''Die Kunde'' N.F. 46 (1995), 137&amp;ndash;55 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Other Iron Age bog bodies have also been beheaded;&lt;ref name=Eternity159/&gt; the body of Dätgen Man, who also had a Suebian knot, was found several metres from his head. The beheading together with the fractured skull indicates deliberate execution by multiple methods. It is impossible to determine whether Osterby Man was sunk in the bog as a judicial punishment or a sacrifice, or whether his body was also deposited in the bog; but it has been suggested that his relatively advanced age may indicate an honorable death.&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society'' 69&amp;ndash;70 (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?ei=X6R5UvaEEMegjALVjoHgBA&amp;id=epCBAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Osterby+Man&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+In+view+of+his+age%2C+he+may+have+been+an+elder+or+even+a+religious+leader p. 302].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Transhumanism}}
The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] provides an overview of and a topical guide to transhumanism:

'''[[Transhumanism]]''' &amp;ndash; international [[school of thought|intellectual and cultural movement]] that affirms the possibility and desirability of fundamentally transforming the [[human condition]] by developing and making widely available [[technology|technologies]] to [[life extension|eliminate aging]] and to greatly [[human enhancement|enhance human]] intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"&gt;
{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of [[emerging technologies|emerging]] and [[hypothetical technology|hypothetical technologies]] that could overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as study the [[technoethics|ethical matters]] involved in developing and using such technologies.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt; They predict that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into beings with such greatly expanded abilities as to merit the label "[[posthuman]]".&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2005"/&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Classification of transhumanism ==
Transhumanism can be described as all of the following:

* Branch of [[philosophy]] &amp;ndash; study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.
** Branch of [[humanism]] &amp;ndash; philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence (rationalism, empiricism) over established doctrine or faith (fideism). In modern times, humanist movements are typically aligned with secularism, and today "Humanism" typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency, and looking to science instead of religious dogma in order to understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 2002 ''[[Amsterdam Declaration|Humanism]]'' issued by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]], or the [[British Humanist Association]]'s [http://humanism.org.uk/humanism definition of Humanism]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Max More: "Transhumanism shares many elements of humanism, including a respect for reason and science, a commitment to progress, and a valuing of human (or transhuman) existence in this life. [...] Transhumanism differs from humanism in recognizing and anticipating the radical alterations in the nature and possibilities of our lives resulting from various sciences and technologies."
* [[Life stance]] &amp;ndash; one's relation with what they accept as being of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|ultimate importance]]. It involves the presuppositions and theories upon which such a stance could be made, a [[belief system]], and a commitment to working it out in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. As treated in ''[[The Intentional Stance]] by [[Daniel Dennett]] {{ISBN|0-262-54053-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Social movement]] &amp;ndash; type of group action. Large, sometimes informal, grouping of individuals or organizations which focus on specific political or social issues. In other words, members of a social movement carry out, resist or undo a social change.
* [[World view]] &amp;ndash; fundamental cognitive orientation of an individual or society encompassing the entirety of the individual or society's knowledge and [[Perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. A world view can include natural philosophy; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, emotions, and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary B. |last=Palmer |title=Toward A Theory of Cultural Linguistics |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1996 |page=114 |isbn=978-0-292-76569-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the framework of ideas and beliefs forming a global description through which an individual, group or culture watches and interprets the [[world (philosophy)|world]] and interacts with it.

== Transhumanist values ==

=== Neophilia{{cn|date=September 2018}} ===
[[Neophilia]] &amp;ndash; strong affinity for novelty and change. Transhumanist neophiliac values include:
* [[Posthumanism]] &amp;ndash; desire to become [[posthuman]].
* [[Proactionary principle]] &amp;ndash; ethical and decision-making principle formulated by the transhumanist philosopher Max More, pertaining to people's freedom to innovate, and the value of protecting that freedom.
* [[Singularitarianism]] &amp;ndash; technocentric ideology and social movement defined by the belief that a technological singularity—the creation of a superintelligence—will likely happen in the medium future, and that deliberate action ought to be taken to ensure that the Singularity benefits humans.
* [[Technophilia]] &amp;ndash; strong enthusiasm for technology, especially new technologies such as personal computers, the Internet, mobile phones and home cinema. The term is used in sociology when examining the interaction of individuals with their society, especially contrasted with technophobia.

=== Survival ===
[[Self-preservation|Survival]] &amp;ndash; survival, or self-preservation, is behavior that ensures the survival of an organism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/self-preservation&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost universal among living organisms. Humans differ from other animals in that they use technology extensively to improve chances of survival and increase [[life expectancy]].
* [[Global catastrophic risk]] &amp;ndash; hypothetical future event with the potential to inflict serious damage to human well-being on a global scale. Some such events could destroy or cripple modern civilization. Other, even more severe, scenarios threaten permanent human extinction. In transhumanist thought, existential risks are to be actively avoided, with the notable exception of the technological singularity.
* [[Human extinction]] &amp;ndash; end of the species ''Homo sapiens sapiens''.  Usually considered bad.  Though opinions vary depending on whether humans are succeeded by progeny species or entities, such as posthumans or strong AI. If there are posthumans, people wouldn't be extinct, just their human predecessors.  If all that remained was strong AI, sentience wouldn't be extinct, just biological sentience. 
* [[Longevity]] &amp;ndash; the length of one's life
** [[Immortality]] &amp;ndash; unable to die or be killed, which scientifically speaking is theoretically impossible.  A related term is [[biological immortality]], which refers to forms of life immune to the effects of aging, which technically are not immortal in the general sense.  It is not yet known if biological immortality is possible for humans.
** [[Indefinite lifespan]] &amp;ndash; hypothetical longevity of humans (and other life-forms) under conditions in which aging is effectively and completely prevented and treated. Their lifespans would be "indefinite" (that is, they would not be "immortal"), because protection from the effects of aging on health does not guarantee survival (from accidents, natural disasters, war, etc.).
** [[Rejuvenation (aging)|Rejuvenation]] &amp;ndash; distinct from life extension. Life extension strategies often study the causes of aging and try to oppose those causes in order to slow aging. Rejuvenation is the reversal of aging and thus requires a different strategy, namely repair of the damage that is associated with aging or replacement of damaged tissue with new tissue. Rejuvenation can be a means of life extension, but most life extension strategies do not involve rejuvenation.

=== Transhumanist ideologies ===
{{Main|Transhumanism#Currents}}
* [[Extropianism]] &amp;ndash; early school of transhumanist thought characterized by a set of principles advocating a [[Proactionary principle|proactive approach]] to human evolution.&lt;ref name="More 1990-2003"&gt;{{cite journal| author = More, Max| title = Principles of extropy| date = 1990–2003| url = http://extropy.org/principles.htm| accessdate = 2006-02-16| authorlink = Max More| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131015142449/http://extropy.org/principles.htm| archivedate = 2013-10-15| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an evolving framework of values and standards for continuously improving the human condition. Extropians believe that advances in science and technology will some day let people live indefinitely. An extropian may wish to contribute to this goal, e.g. by doing research and development or volunteering to test new technology.
* [[Immortalism]] &amp;ndash; moral ideology based upon the belief that [[Immortality#Technological immortality|technological immortality]] is possible and desirable, and advocating research and development to ensure its realization.&lt;ref name=imminst&gt;{{cite web|title=Immortality Institute|url=http://www.imminst.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Postgenderism]] &amp;ndash; social ideology which, though not currently possible, seeks the voluntary elimination of [[gender]] in the human species through the application of advanced biotechnology and [[reproductive technology|assisted reproductive technologies]].&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dvorksy | first = George | authorlink = George Dvorsky | title = Postgenderism: Beyond the Gender Binary| year = 2008 | url = http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2008/03/postgenderism-beyond-gender-binary.html| accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Singularitarianism]] &amp;ndash; moral ideology based upon the belief that a [[technological singularity]] is possible, and advocating deliberate action to affect it and ensure its safety.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kurzweil | first = Raymond | title = [[The Singularity Is Near|The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology]] | publisher = Viking Adult| year = 2005 | isbn = 0-670-03384-7| oclc = 224517172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Technogaianism]] &amp;ndash; ecological ideology based upon the belief that emerging technologies can help restore Earth's environment, and that developing safe, [[clean technology|clean]], [[alternative technology]] should therefore be an important goal of [[environmentalist]]s.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hughes, James| title = [[Citizen Cyborg]]: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future| publisher = Westview Press| year = 2004| isbn = 0-8133-4198-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transhumanist politics ===

[[Transhumanist politics]]
* [[Democratic transhumanism]] &amp;ndash; political philosophy synthesizing [[liberal democracy]], [[social democracy]], [[radical democracy]] and transhumanism.&lt;ref name="Hughes A2002"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Hughes, James|    title = Democratic Transhumanism 2.0|    year = 2002 |   url = http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/DemocraticTranshumanism.htm| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Libertarian transhumanism]] &amp;ndash; political philosophy synthesizing libertarian capitalism and transhumanism.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hughes | first = James | title = The politics of transhumanism | year = 2002 | url = http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm | accessdate=2006-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Transhumanist rights ====
* [[Cognitive liberty]] &amp;ndash; freedom of sovereign control over one's own consciousness. It is an extension of the concepts of freedom of thought and self-ownership.
* [[Morphological freedom]] &amp;ndash; proposed [[civil right]] of a [[person]] to either maintain or [[body modification|modify his or her own body]], on his or her own terms, through [[informed consent|informed, consensual]] recourse to, or refusal of, available therapeutic or enabling [[medical technology]].&lt;ref name="Carrico 2006"&gt;{{cite paper|    author = [[Dale Carrico|Carrico, Dale]]|    title =  The Politics of Morphological Freedom|    year = 2006 |   url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2006/08/politics-of-morphological-freedom.html| accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of transhumanism ==
The term "transhumanism" is largely credited as being coined by [[Sir Julian Huxley]] in 1957, a zoologist and prominent [[humanism|humanist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huxley|first1=Julian|title=Religion Without Revelation|date=1957|publisher=New American Library|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23234243M/Religion_without_revelation|accessdate=2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Preludes to transhumanism
** [[Renaissance humanism]] &amp;ndash; cultural and educational reform during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries, as a response to the challenge of Mediæval scholastic education, emphasizing practical, pre-professional and -scientific studies. Rather than train professionals in jargon and strict practice, humanists sought to create a citizenry (sometimes including women) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity.
** [[Age of Enlightenment]] &amp;ndash; elite cultural movement of intellectuals in 18th century Europe that sought to mobilize the power of reason in order to reform society and advance knowledge. It promoted intellectual interchange and opposed intolerance and abuses in church and state.
** [[Russian cosmism]] &amp;ndash; past philosophical and cultural movement that emerged in Russia in the early 20th century. It entailed a broad theory of natural philosophy, combining elements of religion and ethics with a history and philosophy of the origin, evolution and future existence of the cosmos, and an expanding role of humankind within it.
* [[Transhumanism#History|Emergence of transhumanism]]

== Current technological factors ==
* [[Human condition]] – the irreducible part of humanity that is inherent and not connected to gender, race, class, etc.; the experiences of being human in a social, cultural, and personal context. Transhumanism aims to radically improve the human condition. The present human condition is highly technological, and is becoming more so.
* [[Noosphere]] &amp;ndash; "sphere of human thought".&lt;ref&gt;Georgy S. Levit: [http://www2.uni-jena.de/biologie/ehh/personal/glevit/Teilhard.pdf The Biosphere and the Noosphere Theories of V. I. Vernadsky and P. Teilhard de Chardin: A Methodological Essay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050517081543/http://www2.uni-jena.de/biologie/ehh/personal/glevit/Teilhard.pdf |date=2005-05-17 }}. International Archives on the History of Science/Archives Internationales D'Histoire des Sciences, 50 (144) - 2000: S. 160-176&lt;/ref&gt; In the original theory of [[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky|Vernadsky]], the noosphere (sentience) is the third in a succession of phases of development of the Earth, after the [[geosphere]] (inanimate matter) and the [[biosphere]] (biological life).  The noosphere includes technological endeavor.
* [[Technological change]] &amp;ndash; overall process of invention, innovation and diffusion of technology (including processes).
** Rate of technological change
*** [[Accelerating change]] &amp;ndash; perceived increase in the rate of technological (and sometimes social and cultural) progress throughout history, which may suggest faster and more profound change in the future. While many have suggested accelerating change, the popularity of this theory in modern times is closely associated with various advocates of the technological singularity, such as Vernor Vinge and Ray Kurzweil.
**** [[Moore's law]] &amp;ndash; the observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years. The law is named after Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore, who described the trend in his 1965 paper.
** Management of technological change
*** [[Differential technological development]] &amp;ndash; strategy proposed by transhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom in which societies would seek to influence the sequence in which emerging technologies developed. On this approach, societies would strive to retard the development of harmful technologies and their applications, while accelerating the development of beneficial technologies, especially those that offer protection against the harmful ones.
** Influences on technological change
*** Ideologies promoting technological change
**** [[Innovation economics]] &amp;ndash; growing economic theory that emphasizes entrepreneurship and innovation. Innovation economics is based on two fundamental tenets: that the central goal of economic policy should be to spur higher productivity through greater innovation, and that markets relying on input resources and price signals alone will not always be as effective in spurring higher productivity, and thereby economic growth.
**** [[Singularitarianism]] &amp;ndash; technocentric ideology and social movement defined by the belief that a technological singularity (TS), that is, the creation of a superintelligence, will likely happen in the medium future, and that deliberate action ought to be taken to ensure that the Singularity benefits humans. Singularitarians endeavor to bring about the TS.
*** [[Innovation]] &amp;ndash; application of better solutions (in the form of new ideas, new devices or new processes) that meet new requirements, inarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more effective products, processes, services, technologies, or ideas that are readily available to markets, governments and society.

=== Emerging technologies of interest to transhumanists ===
{{See also|List of emerging technologies}}
[[Emerging technologies]] &amp;ndash; contemporary advances and innovation in various fields of technology, prior to or early in their [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion]]. They are typically in the form of progressive developments intended to achieve a competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;International Congress Innovation and Technology XXI: Strategies and Policies Towards the XXI Century, &amp; Soares, O. D. D. (1997). Innovation and technology: Strategies and policies. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;  Transhumanists believe that humans can and should use technologies to become [[posthuman|more than human]]. Emerging technologies offer the greatest potential in doing so. Examples of developing technologies that have become the focus of transhumanism include:
* [[Anti-aging]] &amp;ndash; another term for "life extension".
* [[Outline of artificial intelligence|Artificial intelligence]] &amp;ndash; intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it. AI textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents",&lt;ref name="Definition of AI"&gt;
Definition of AI as the study of [[intelligent agents]]:
** [[Swarm intelligence]] &amp;ndash;
* {{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|loc=[http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/ci/ch1.pdf p. 1]}}, which provides the version that is used in this article. Note that they use the term "computational intelligence" as a synonym for artificial intelligence.

[[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|McCarthy]]'s definition of AI:
* {{Harvnb|McCarthy|2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Augmented reality]] &amp;ndash; live, direct or indirect, view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. As a result, the technology functions by enhancing one’s current perception of reality. By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one.
* [[Biomedical engineering]] &amp;ndash;  application of engineering principles and design concepts to biology and medicine, to improve healthcare diagnosis, monitoring and therapy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospects.ac.uk/p/types_of_job/biomedical_engineer_job_description.jsp Biomedical engineer] prospects&lt;/ref&gt; Applications include the development of biocompatible prostheses, clinical equipment, micro-implants, imaging equipment such as MRIs and EEGs, regenerative tissue growth, pharmaceutical drugs and therapeutic biologicals.
** [[Neural engineering]] &amp;ndash; discipline that uses engineering techniques to understand, repair, replace, enhance, or otherwise exploit the properties of neural systems. Neural engineers are uniquely qualified to solve design problems at the interface of living neural tissue and non-living constructs. Also known as "neuroengineering".
*** [[Neurohacking]] &amp;ndash; colloquial term encompassing all methods of manipulating or interfering with the structure and/or function of neurons for improvement or repair.
* [[Outline of biotechnology|Biotechnology]] &amp;ndash; field of applied biology that uses living organisms and bioprocesses in engineering, technology, medicine, and manufacturing, among other fields. It encompasses a wide range of procedures for modifying living organisms for human purposes. Early examples of biotechnology include domestication of animals, cultivation of plants, and breeding through artificial selection and hybridization.
** [[Bionics]] &amp;ndash; in medicine, this refers to the replacement or enhancement of organs or other body parts by mechanical versions. Bionic implants differ from mere prostheses by mimicking the original function very closely, or even surpassing it.
*** [[Cyborg]] &amp;ndash; being with both biological and artificial (e.g. electronic, mechanical or robotic) parts.
** [[Brain-computer interface]] &amp;ndash; direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device. BCIs are under development to assist, augment, or repair human cognitive and sensory-motor functions. Sometimes called a direct neural interface or a brain–machine interface (BMI).
** [[Cloning]] &amp;ndash; in biotechnology, this refers to processes used to create copies of DNA fragments (molecular cloning), cells (cell cloning), or organisms.
*** [[Therapeutic cloning]] &amp;ndash; application of somatic-cell nuclear transfer (a laboratory technique for creating a clonal embryo using an ovum with a donor nucleus) in [[regenerative medicine]].
* [[Cognitive science]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary scientific study of mind and its processes. It examines what cognition is, what it does and how it works. It includes research on how information is processed (in faculties such as perception, language, memory, reasoning, and emotion), represented, and transformed in behaviour, (human or other animal) nervous system or machine (e.g., computer). It includes research on artificial intelligence.
* [[Computer-mediated reality]] &amp;ndash; ability to add to, subtract information from, or otherwise manipulate one's perception of reality through the use of a [[wearable computer]] or hand-held device&lt;ref&gt;[http://wearcam.org/mr.html "Wearable, Tetherless, Computer-Mediated Reality"], Technical Report #260, M.I.T. Medial Lab Perceptual Computing Section, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; such as a smart phone.
* [[Cryonics]] &amp;ndash; low-temperature preservation of humans and animals who can no longer be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and resuscitation may be possible in the future. Cryopreservation of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology.
* [[Cyberware]] &amp;ndash; hardware or machine parts implanted in the human body and acting as an interface between the central nervous system and the computers or machinery connected to it. Research in this area is a protoscience.
* [[Head-mounted display]] (HMD) &amp;ndash; display device, worn on the head or as part of a helmet, that has a small display optic in front of one (monocular HMD) or each eye (binocular HMD).
* [[Human enhancement technologies]] (HET) &amp;ndash; techniques used to treat illness or disability, or to enhance human characteristics and capacities.&lt;ref name="Enhancement Technologies Group 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Enhancement Technologies Group|    title = Writings by group participants|  year = 1998 |   url = http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucbtdag/bioethics/writings/index.html| accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition, coined in 1991, is for a category of handheld devices that provide personal information manager functions and packet switched wireless data communications capabilities over wireless wide area networks such as cellular networks. These devices are now commonly referred to as smartphones or wireless PDAs.
* [[Personal development]] &amp;ndash; includes activities that improve awareness and identity, develop talents and potential, build human capital and facilitates employability, enhance quality of life and contribute to the realization of dreams and aspirations. The concept is not limited to self-help, but includes formal and informal activities for developing others, in roles such as teacher, guide, counselor, manager, coach, or mentor.  Finally, as personal development takes place in the context of institutions, it refers to the methods, programs, tools, techniques, and assessment systems that support human development at the individual level in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Aubrey, ''Managing Your Aspirations: Developing Personal Enterprise in the Global Workplace''  McGraw-Hill 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-07-131178-6}}, page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Technological evolution]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Directed evolution]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Extropy]] &amp;ndash; opposing concept of entropy. It poses that culture and technology will aid the universe in developing in an orderly progressive manner. So extropy is the tendency of systems to grow more organized.
* [[Intelligence explosion]] &amp;ndash; possible outcome of humanity building artificial general intelligence (AGI), and hypothetically a direct result of such a technological singularity, in that AGI would be capable of recursive self-improvement leading to rapid emergence of ASI (artificial superintelligence), the limits of which are unknown.
* [[Megatrajectory]] &amp;ndash; theoretical concept in [[evolutionary biology]] that describes paradigmatic developmental stages (major evolutionary milestones) and potential directionality in the [[evolution]] of [[life]]. A theorized megatrajectory that hasn't occurred yet is [[postbiological evolution]] triggered by the emergence of [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]] and several other similarly complex technologies.
* Participant evolution &amp;ndash; process of deliberately redesigning the human body and brain using technological means, rather than through the natural processes of mutation and natural selection, with the goal of removing "biological limitations."
** [[Liberal eugenics]] &amp;ndash; use of reproductive and genetic technologies where the choice of enhancing human characteristics and capacities is left to the individual preferences of parents acting as consumers, rather than the public health policies of the state.
*** [[Procreative beneficence]] &amp;ndash;
*** [[Procreative liberty]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Posthumanity]] &amp;ndash; all persons technologically evolved from humans, but that are no longer human. Post humanity might include:
** [[Posthuman]]s&lt;ref name="World Transhumanist Association 2002-2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[World Transhumanist Association]] &amp;ndash; | title = The transhumanist FAQ | date = 2002–2005 | url = http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/FAQv21.pdf | accessdate = 2006-08-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061231225013/http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/FAQv21.pdf | archivedate = 2006-12-31 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; in transhumanism, they are hypothetical [[future]] beings "whose basic capacities so radically exceed those of present humans as to be no longer unambiguously [[human]] by our current standards."&lt;ref name="World Transhumanist Association 2002-2005"/&gt; A being technologically evolved from humans.
*** [[Superhuman]]s &amp;ndash; humans with extraordinary and unusual capabilities enabling them to perform feats well beyond anything that an ordinary person could conceivably achieve, even through long-time training and development. Superhuman can mean an improved human, for example, by genetic modification, cybernetic implants, nanotechnology, or as what humans might eventually evolve into thousands or millions of years later into the distant future.
**** [[Posthuman God]]s &amp;ndash; posthumans, being no longer confined to the parameters of human nature, might grow physically and mentally so powerful as to appear god-like by human standards.&lt;ref name="World Transhumanist Association 2002-2005"/&gt;
**** [[Übermensch]] &amp;ndash; concept of the superhuman in the philosophy of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Nietzsche had his character Zarathustra posit the Übermensch as a goal for humanity to set for itself in his 1883 novel Thus Spoke Zarathustra (German: Also Sprach Zarathustra).
* [[Sociocultural_evolution#Technological_perspectives|Sociocultural evolution from a technological perspective]] &amp;ndash; evolution transitioning from one basis to new forms, such as evolution through biology, then through cognition, then through culture, then through technology, including the possibility of a fusion between biology and technology.
* [[Technological convergence]] &amp;ndash; tendency for different technological systems to evolve towards performing similar tasks. Convergence can refer to previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications), and video that now share resources and interact with each other synergistically.
** [[Technological_convergence#Converging_technological_fields|NBIC]] &amp;ndash; acronym signifying the converging of [[Nanotechnology|'''N'''anotechnology]], [[Biotechnology|'''B'''iotechnology]], [[Information technology|'''I'''nformation technology]] and [[Cognitive science|'''C'''ognitive science]]

* [[Technological singularity]] (TS) &amp;ndash; hypothetical future emergence of superintelligence through technological means. This could be achieved through the development of artificial intelligence as smart as humans ([[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]). Once computers become as capable as humans, they would be recursive, that is, they could improve themselves through redesign and modification. They could also conceivably mass-produce successively more capable models of artificially intelligent computers and robots. Another route might be through the fusion of a human and a computer, resulting in a being with rapid recursive improvement potential.  Therefore, the technological singularity is seen as an intellectual event horizon, beyond which the future becomes difficult to forecast. Nevertheless, proponents of the singularity typically anticipate an "intelligence explosion", leading quickly to the development of superintelligence, and resulting in technological and sociological change so rapid that mere humans would not be able to keep up with it. Does the TS hold promise for human civilization, or peril?
** Promise
*** [[Friendly artificial intelligence]] &amp;ndash; if the technological singularity were to be achieved through the development of strong AI that was friendly to humans and held the well-being of the human race in primary focus, human civilization may be improved in progressively more fantastic ways, rather than come to an abrupt end.
*** Utopia &amp;ndash; ''see [[#Utopia|Utopia]], below''
** Peril
*** [[AI takeover]] &amp;ndash; upon its emergence, artificial general intelligence may quickly become the dominant form of intelligence on Earth
*** [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence]] &amp;ndash; in that strong AI has the potential to wipe out the human species, as would a comet hitting the Earth, the technological singularity is an existential risk. ''See also [[#Survival|Survival]], above''

{{anchor|Utopia}}
* [[Utopia]] – an idyllic society, one of the goals of transhumanism.
** [[Techno-utopia]] &amp;ndash; hypothetical ideal society, in which laws, government, and social conditions are solely operating for the benefit and well-being of all its citizens, set in the near- or far-future, when advanced science and technology will allow these ideal living standards to exist; for example, post scarcity, transformations in human nature, the abolition of suffering and even the end of death.
** [[Techno-utopianism]] &amp;ndash; any ideology based on the belief that advances in science and technology will eventually bring about a utopia, or at least help to fulfill one or another utopian ideal.
* [[Omega Point]] &amp;ndash; term coined by the French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955) to describe a maximum level of complexity and consciousness towards which he believed the universe was evolving.

=== Hypothetical technologies ===
[[Hypothetical technology]] &amp;ndash; technology that does not exist yet, but the development of which could potentially be achieved in the future. It is distinct from an emerging technology, which has achieved some developmental success. A hypothetical technology is typically not proven to be impossible.  Many hypothetical technologies have been the subject of science fiction.
* [[Artificial general intelligence]] &amp;ndash; hypothetical artificial intelligence that demonstrates human-like intelligence – the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a primary goal of artificial intelligence research and an important topic for science fiction writers and futurists. Artificial general intelligence is also referred to as ''strong AI'',&lt;ref name="K"&gt;{{Harv|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} or see [http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/08/advanced_human_.html Advanced Human Intelligence] where he defines strong AI as "machine intelligence with the full range of human intelligence."&lt;/ref&gt; ''full AI''&lt;ref&gt;[http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/The-Age-of-Artificial-Intellige The Age of Artificial Intelligence: George John at TEDxLondonBusinessSchool 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; or as the ability to perform "general intelligent action".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|Simon|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong AI is the focus and hypothesized cause of the technological singularity.
** [[Friendly artificial intelligence]] &amp;ndash; artificial intelligence (AI) that has a positive rather than negative effect on humanity. Friendly AI also refers to the field of knowledge required to build such an AI. AIs may be harmful to humans if steps are not taken to specifically design them to be benevolent. Doing so effectively is the primary goal of Friendly AI.

* [[Human cloning]] &amp;ndash; creation of a genetically identical copy of a human. It does not usually refer to monozygotic multiple births nor the reproduction of human cells or tissue. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning; human clones in the form of identical twins are commonplace, with their cloning occurring during the natural process of reproduction.
* [[Mind uploading]] &amp;ndash; hypothetical process of transferring or copying a conscious mind from a brain to a non-biological substrate by scanning and mapping a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer would have to run a simulation model so faithful to the original that it would behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishably.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;

** [[Molecular assembler]]s &amp;ndash; as defined by K. Eric Drexler, is a "proposed device able to guide chemical reactions by positioning reactive molecules with atomic precision". Some biological molecules such as ribosomes fit this definition, because they receive instructions from messenger RNA and then assemble specific sequences of amino acids to construct protein molecules. However, the term "molecular assembler" usually refers to theoretical human-made devices.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16.1200008392334px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;Drexler, K.

* [[Space colonization]] &amp;ndash; concept of permanent human habitation outside of Earth. Although hypothetical at the present time, there are many proposals and speculations about the first space colony. It is a long-term goal of some national space programs. Also called "space settlement", "space humanization", and "space habitation".
* [[Superintelligence]] &amp;ndash; hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. For example, a supercomputer with mental capacity exceeding the brainpower and cognitive abilities of all the people of Earth combined, while developing itself even further.

== Transhumanism in fiction ==
[[Transhumanism in fiction]] &amp;ndash; Many of the tropes of science fiction can be viewed as similar to the goals of transhumanism. Science fiction literature contains many positive depictions of technologically enhanced human life, occasionally set in utopian (especially techno-utopian) societies. However, science fiction's depictions of technologically enhanced humans or other posthuman beings frequently come with a cautionary twist. The more pessimistic scenarios include many dystopian tales of human bioengineering gone wrong.

'''Robotman''' is a Golden Age [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]. He first appeared in ''Star-Spangled Comics'' #7 (April 1942) and was created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Leo Nowak (artist)|Leo Nowak]]. Despite his name, Robotman is not a [[robot]]; he is a [[cyborg]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Robert Crane''' is a scientist whose brain was placed inside a robotic body after he had been fatally shot. Since Crane had to be legally dead for his assailants to be charged with murder, he created a civilian identity as Paul Dennis, accomplished with lifelike face mask and gloves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Rozakis|Rozakis, Bob]], "Heroes Who Wouldn't Die!," ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #116, December 1974-January 1975, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; As Robotman, he was a member of the [[World War II]]-era team, the [[All-Star Squadron]]. He also fought crime solo with help from his canine sidekick, Robotdog. His stories were mostly lighthearted in nature, featuring whimsical situations and plenty of comedy relief (usually provided by Robotdog).

In 1951, Crane helped Charles McNider, the original [[Doctor Mid-Nite]], make the devices McNider needed to become [[Starman (comics)|Starman]]. McNider used the devices in that guise for a half a year and then gave them to [[Starman (comics)|David Knight]], a Starman from the future who used them for the rest of the year before returning to the future and dying there.

Robotman was revealed to have been one of several other heroes involved in the first meeting of the charter members of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] prior to the official forming of the team, an event which was suppressed from the public record.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Englehart|Englehart, Steve]], [[Dick Dillin]], &amp; [[Frank McLaughlin (comics)|Frank McLaughlin]], "The Origin of the Justice League&amp;mdash;Minus One!," ''Justice League of America'', #144, July 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robotman's career came to an end by unique means. His former lab assistant, Charles Grayson, discovered that he was dying of a brain disease which left the rest of his tissues unharmed. He therefore bequeathed his body to Robotman to give him the possibility of a new life. Robotman had been trapped in suspended animation after being caught in a rockslide. His mechanical body shut down to preserve his brain, and it took twenty years for enough power to build up for him to reactivate and free himself. A power surge revived him, and after adjusting to being twenty years in the future, he learned what Grayson had done for him and gladly regained the humanity he'd thought lost forever.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Rozakis|Rozakis, Bob]], [[Alex Saviuk]] &amp; [[Vince Colletta]], "Whatever Happened to Robotman?," ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #31, March 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Wells|first = John|title = Flashback: Whatever Happened to...?|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue = 64|pages = 51–61|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No longer a [[cyborg]], he resurfaced in the first issues of ''[[Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.]]'' and lent [[Pat Dugan]] some components of his own disassembled [[robot]]ic body in order to perfect the S.T.R.I.P.E. suit of armor.

==Other versions==

===Elseworlds===
In the [[Elseworlds]] series ''[[The Golden Age (comics)|The Golden Age]]'', Robotman figures prominently as a troubled hero and later villain. The series depicts that after [[World War II]]  Robotman purposefully ignores his humanity, developing an inhuman mental state, focusing on being a robot. He is depicted stopping a robbery with deadly force, and later being approached by [[Tex Thomson|Tex Thompson]] (Mr. America), the current form of the [[Ultra-Humanite]]. It is unsaid what the Ultra-Humanite promises or uses to recruit Robotman, but Robotman becomes his unquestioning servant, committing murder, and often staying close to Thompson during his political appearances. Thompson even berates him without any objections from Robotman. Publicly, Robotman is hailed as one of the few heroes to go public and serve with Thompson. In the final battle Robotman brutally kills [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]] before she reveals Thompson is the Ultra-Humanite. An enraged [[Hourman]] rips off one of Robotman's arms and finishes Miss America's public accusation. While the other heroes face Dynaman, a transformed [[Dan the Dyna-Mite]], [[Paula Brooks]] (a reformed villain, the [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tigress]]) and Lance Gallant ([[Captain Triumph]]), who had become lovers over the course of the story, confront and defeat Robotman. During their fight Robotman states he always knew the Ultra-Humanite was in Tex Thompson's body and that he does not care. In the end, Gallant, refusing to transform into Captain Triumph, shoves one of the Tigress' wooden crossbow bolts further into Robotman's head. This causes Robotman to explode and fatally electrocutes Gallant, much to the Tigress' and Gallant's deceased brother's sorrow.

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Robert Crane is a human scientist, never becoming a Robotman in World War II. Recently Robert's government services are shutting the Project M down of [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]] and the [[Creature Commandos]].&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Frankenstein and the Creatures of the Unknown'' #1 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era, Robert Crane is still alive and now a doctor, and he helps the government revive G.I. Robot to join the soldiers to eliminate Frankenstein and the Creatures of the Unknown after they escape from the lab facility.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Frankenstein and the Creatures of the Unknown'' #2 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sapayoa''' or '''broad-billed sapayoa''' (''Sapayoa aenigma'') is a [[suboscine]] [[passerine]] found in lowland [[rainforest]]s in Panama and north-western South America. As the epithet ''aenigma'' ("the [[wiktionary:enigma|enigma]]") implies, its relationships have long been elusive. It is easy to overlook, but appears to be common in a wide range and is not considered threatened by the [[IUCN]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BLI (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The sapayoa was [[Species description|formally described]] by the German ornithologist [[Ernst Hartert]] in 1903 under the present [[binomial name]] ''Sapayoa aenigma''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last=Hartert | first=Ernst | author-link=Ernst Hartert | year=1903 | title=On a remarkable new oligomyodian genus and species from Ecuador | journal=Novitates Zoologicae | volume=10 | pages=117–118 | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15771199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has always been considered a [[monotypic]] genus, '''''Sapayoa''''', and historically regarded as a New World [[suboscine]]; in particular, it was assigned to the manakin family ([[Pipridae]]). However, the [[species]] was listed as ''[[incertae sedis]]'' (position uncertain) in the [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]], because
&lt;blockquote&gt;"preliminary DNA-DNA hybridization comparisons ... indicate that this species is either a relative of the Old World [[Eurylaimidae]] or a sister group of all other [[Tyrannidae|Tyrannida]], as suggested by earlier biochemical studies .... In any event, it is not a close relative of manakins or any other recent tyrannoid."&lt;ref&gt;Sibley &amp; Munroe (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recent research suggests that it is not a New World suboscine at all, but an Old World suboscine. In 2004, it was shown that the sapayoa is an outlier to the New World suboscines.&lt;ref&gt;Chesser (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier analysis based on [[nDNA]] [[myoglobin]] [[intron]] 2 and [[GAPDH]] intron 11 [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data, the authors found the sapayoa 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"as a deep branch in the group of [[broadbill]]s and [[pitta]]s of the Old World tropics."&lt;ref name = fjeldsaetal2003&gt;Fjeldså et al. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, the sapayoa would be the last surviving New World species of a lineage that evolved in [[Australia-New Guinea]] when [[Gondwana]] was in the process of splitting apart. The sapayoa's ancestors are hypothesized to have reached South America via the [[Western Antarctica]] Peninsula.

Nowadays, the sapoyoa is sometimes placed in the family [[Eurylaimidae]] with the broadbills.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Banks et al. (2008), Remsen et al. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Others tentatively place the sapayoa in the [[asity]] family Philepittidae&lt;ref&gt;Kemp &amp; Sherley (2003), though it is not clear whether it was Kemp and Sherley or Perrins who decided to include the broad-billed sapayoa in the Philepittidae.&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise found only in Madagascar and sometimes included in the broadbill family.

However, the divergence between the broadbills and the sapayoa found in the 2003 study is only slightly less deep than that between the sapayoa and the pittas.&lt;ref name = fjeldsaetal2003 /&gt; It is even possible though unlikely that the present species is actually closer to the pittas than to the broadbills. Consequently, it is now placed in its own monotypic [[family (biology)|family]], '''Sapayoidae'''.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Irestedt et al. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ioc&gt;{{cite web| editor1-last=Gill | editor1-first=Frank | editor1-link=Frank Gill (ornithologist) | editor2-last=Donsker | editor2-first=David | year=2017 | title=NZ wrens, broadbills &amp; pittas | work=World Bird List Version 7.2 | url=http://www.worldbirdnames.org/bow/nz_wrens/ | publisher=International Ornithologists' Union | accessdate=29 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The sapayoa is a small, olive-colored bird, somewhat paler below and with a yellowish throat.  Its [[Morphology (biology)|habitus]] resembles a bigger, longer-tailed, broader-billed female [[manakin]].

'''Scott Edgar Dyleski''' (born October 30, 1988 in [[San Francisco, California]]) was convicted of murdering his neighbor, Pamela Vitale, the wife of prominent [[Lawyer|attorney]] [[Daniel Horowitz]].  He received the maximum penalty allowed by the law, [[life in prison without parole]].  As a juvenile at the time of the murder, he did not qualify for the [[death penalty]]. The murder was committed on October 15, 2005, when Dyleski was 16 years old.  He is currently serving his sentence in [[California State Prison, Corcoran]].

==Background==
Dyleski was born in [[San Francisco, California]] to Kenneth Dyleski and Esther Fielding. His parents separated when he was three years old, and Dyleski was reared by his mother. During elementary school, Dyleski moved with his mother to [[Lafayette, California]], and began living in the home of another family, with whom they had long been friends. Dyleski attended Lafayette public schools, including [[Acalanes High School]], where he dressed in uncommon clothing such as trench coats and was described as "a nice kid" by a fellow student.

==Murder==
On October 15, 2005, Dyleski's neighbor Pamela Vitale was found murdered in her home. She was found lying in the entryway just inside the front door and had been [[Bludgeon (weapon)|bludgeon]]ed to death. Five days later, on October 20, 2005, Dyleski was arrested on suspicion of committing the murder.

==Trial==
Initially, Dyleski was represented by attorney Thomas McKenna. He later asked to be removed from the case, because he defended the driver of a car that killed Dyleski's sister and another passenger in 2002. Dyleski was then represented by Ellen Leonida, a public defender.&lt;ref name="mom"/&gt; Dyleski pleaded not guilty.

Investigators believe Dyleski and his friend, Robin Croen, planned to grow [[marijuana]] in Scott Dyleski's closet, with Dyleski in charge of raising money, according to Croen, who was granted immunity for testifying. He testified that Dyleski used stolen [[credit card]] information belonging to his neighbors and used the cards to order lighting equipment. He also testified that his role in the credit card scam was researching what equipment to order. Croen actually constructed{{clarify|date=March 2012}} order forms from websites that he claims he then sent to Dyleski. According to prosecutors, one of Dyleski's orders used the credit card information for Karen Schneider, but mistakenly used Vitale's address as the address to bill, and his own address as the ship-to address. The lighting company refused to process the order, suspecting it was fraudulent. Dyleski told Croen that he would "take care of it"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/08/22/MNG3MKN3GE5.DTL | title=Prosecutor: Vitale unintended target | first=Henry K. | last=Lee | date=2006-08-22 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, subsequently, he made one more attempt by calling the credit card company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/View?id=dhbz29t9_2cpkmdgck|title=Dyleski Justices Opnion Direct Appeal A115725|work=Google Docs|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities believe Dyleski was surprised by Vitale during a burglary of her home. However, Dyleski's girlfriend, Jena Reddy testified at trial that Dyleski had talked about beating and breaking the necks of children and was curious about how the human body would function without certain organs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Girlfriend-Dyleski-talked-about-torturing-2514732.php&lt;/ref&gt; They said he killed Vitale by striking her numerous times in the head, possibly with a rock, and then carved a symbol into her back. During the trial, prosecutor Harold Jewett tried to establish that the symbol found on the victim's back closely resembled the letter "H" in the word "hate" from a bumper sticker reading "I'm for the separation of Church and Hate", which was seized from Dyleski's bedroom.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The coroner's autopsy report describes the marks on Vitale's back as an "H-shaped figure cut into skin of posterior torso"&lt;ref name= "H-shaped"&gt;courttv.com, [http://www.courttv.com/news/horowitz/docs/autopsy.html?page=6 "Pamela Vitale's Autopsy and Toxicology Reports", page 6].&lt;/ref&gt; and "3 intersecting superficial incisions... forming an H-shaped pattern with extension".&lt;ref name= "H-shaped pattern with extension"&gt;courttv.com [http://www.courttv.com/news/horowitz/docs/autopsy.html?page=8 "Pamela Vitale's Autopsy and Toxicology Reports", page 8].&lt;/ref&gt;  Other reports indicate that the symbol was a [[Cross of Lorraine]].&lt;ref name="twh"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pitzl-Waters|first1=Jason|title=Are You Involved in Wicca or Goth?|url=http://wildhunt.org/2006/07/are-you-involved-in-wicca-or-goth.html|website=The Wild Hunt|publisher=Wild Hunt, Inc.|accessdate=18 July 2017|date=2006-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grace|first1=Nancy|title=16-Year-Old Accused of Killing Pamela Vitale Arraigned|url=http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0510/21/ng.01.html|website=cnn.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=18 July 2017|date=2005-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, judge Mary Ann O'Malley ruled that prosecutors had enough evidence for trial. Dyleski was arraigned on an additional charge of [[burglary|first-degree residential burglary]] and he entered a new plea of not guilty to all the charges. His mother was accused of helping her son destroy evidence, but the charge was dropped under the condition that she testify truthfully.&lt;ref name="mom"&gt;[http://www.nbc11.com/news/5193063/detail.html "Accused Killer's Mother Arrested In Vitale Case"], ''NBC11.com'', October 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Burglary was not presented as a motive during the trial and, in fact, it was stated that nothing had been taken. At trial, Daniel Horowitz said he had never gone through his wife's financial records to see if anything was amiss.

Jury selection began in July 2006 in the courtroom of judge Barbara Zuniga, who became the trial judge after defense attorney Ellen Leonida made a [[peremptory challenge]] against judge Mary Ann O'Malley on the grounds that the jurist was "prejudiced against the interest of the defendant". Attorneys provided contrasting views of Dyleski in their opening statements. Prosecutor Harold Jewett said Dyleski identified with [[Goth subculture|gothic]] symbols and art that depicted violence and stabbed and beat Vitale. Leonida described her client as a gentle kid whose friends know he isn't a killer and instead valued human and animal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/08/23/BAGF5KNFKI1.DTL&amp;feed=rss.news | title=MARTINEZ / Clash of details as Dyleski case heads to jury | first=Henry K. | last=Lee | date=2006-08-23 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, the [[Nickelodeon]] animated television series ''[[Invader Zim]]'' was cited. The prosecution asserted that the defendant had a fascination with images of body parts. They drew attention to comments he had made after watching the episode "Dark Harvest", in which the alien Zim collects human organs in an attempt to appear more human. Witnesses for the defense said that the comments were made in jest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/08/21/BAG51KMGAT5.DTL | title=Two teens testify for Dyleski | publisher=[[San Francisco Gate]] | date=2006-08-21 | author=Lee, Henry K. | accessdate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of August attorneys gave closing arguments, capping several weeks of testimony. The prosecutor called to the stand Dyleski's housemates, mother, girlfriend, friend, a forensic pathologist, a DNA expert and several [[criminalist]]s. Lawyer [[Gloria Allred]] represented Jena Reddy, Dyleski's girlfriend. She told the jury that while Dyleski never admitted or denied killing his neighbor, he told her he would take the blame to protect her and his best friend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/10/02/scotus.allred.ap/index.html "Justices refuse to ungag Gloria Allred"], ''CNN.com'', October 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; DNA evidence showed Vitale's blood was found on Dyleski's belongings, the DNA of both Vitale and Dyleski was found on the [[ski mask]] worn during the murder, and his DNA was found on the bottom of her foot (17 out of 17 markers matched).&lt;ref&gt;Dearen, Jason. ''Oakland Tribune'', 16 August 2006 [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20060816/ai_n16643728 DNA Mix Traced To Victim and Dyleski]. Accessed 31 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A shoe print at the murder scene was determined by the jury to match shoes belonging to Dyleski. Jason Kwast, another criminalist, testified that the pattern of bloody footprints found on a plastic lid that was discovered in Vitale's house matched the pattern of the bottom of Land's End shoes belonging to Dyleski.&lt;ref&gt;KGO San Francisco (ABC 7).

[http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=local&amp;id=4461231 "Dyleski Trial: DNA Found On Clothing"] Accessed 31 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A chilling to-do list was purported to have been written by Dyleski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jR4CTqjYPISgsQOIk6WvDQ&amp;ved=0CBYQvwUoAQ&amp;q=Dyleski+to+do+list&amp;spell=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=e4e9934dc34913ea&amp;biw=1557&amp;bih=863|title=Google|publisher=|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonida called a number of Dyleski's friends to serve as character witnesses. Dyleski exercised his right to remain silent and did not testify. No [[DNA]] experts were called to rebut the prosecution's DNA evidence.

== Verdict ==
Scott Dyleski was found guilty of all the charges against him: first-degree murder, the special circumstance of murder in the commission of a first-degree residential burglary, first-degree residential burglary and an enhancement for using a dangerous weapon to bludgeon Vitale. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He was held in juvenile hall until his 18th birthday on October 30, 2006 (about one month after sentencing) and was then transferred to [[San Quentin Prison]]. He was kept out of the general population while his case was evaluated and was then transferred to [[Kern Valley State Prison]] several months later.  In 2009, the Court of Appeal justices upheld the conviction and noted, "The defendant in this case committed a truly heinous crime. Putting on a dark mask and gloves, and arming himself with a rock and a knife, he invaded the home of a complete stranger to him. Without any provocation, he viciously set upon Pamela Vitale, raining blow after blow on her as she tried to fight him off."  The court also noted that even as "Vitale  lay motionless and near death, defendant was still not done with her. He put away his rock and pulled out a knife. He pulled Vitale's T-shirt up and used the knife to draw some type of mark or symbol on Vitale's back. He then turned Vitale over and stabbed deep into her midsection, leaving a gaping wound in her abdomen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverda.org/dna_documents/dyleski.pdf|title=Court Opinion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''snuff film''', or '''snuff movie''', is "a movie in a purported genre of movies in which a person is actually [[murder]]ed or commits [[suicide]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[American Heritage Dictionary]], ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt; It may or may not be made for financial gain, but is supposedly "circulated amongst a jaded few for the purpose of entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Snuff films false |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/snuff.asp |date=October 31, 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some filmed records of executions and murders exist, but in those cases, the death was not specifically staged for financial gain or entertainment.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/snuff.htm|title=Barbara Mikkelson, "A Pinch of Snuff", Snopes.com, 31 Oct 2006, accessed 8 April 2007|work=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first known use of the term ''snuff movie'' is in a 1971 book by [[Ed Sanders]], ''The Family: The Story of Charles Manson's Dune Buggy Attack Battalion''. He alleges that [[Charles Manson|The Manson Family]] was involved in making such a film in California to record their murders.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LloT4dmu7xMC extract from book]&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun ''snuff'' originally meant the part of a candle wick that has already burned; the verb ''snuff'' meant to cut this off, and by extension to extinguish or kill.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1st ed, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; The word has been used in this sense in English slang for hundreds of years.

According to [[Geoffrey O'Brien]], "whether or not commercially distributed 'snuff' movies actually exist, the possibility of such movies is implicit in the stock [[B-movie]] motif of the mad artist killing his models, as in ''[[A Bucket of Blood]]'' [1959], ''[[Color Me Blood Red]]'' [1965], or ''Decoy for Terror'' [1967]" also known as ''Playgirl Killer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Geoffrey O’Brien|O’Brien, Geoffrey]] |date=1993|title=Horror for Pleasure|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]}} (April 22 issue), n.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of "snuff films" being made for profit became more widely known with the commercial film ''[[Snuff (film)|Snuff]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name="csicop.org"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/snuff_film_the_making_of_an_urban_legend/ |author=Stine, Scott Aaron |title=The Snuff Film: The Making of an Urban Legend |work=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=23.3 |date=1999 |accessdate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2p7i4oL6Dk |title=Do snuff movies exist? |series=Documentary, part 1 |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cook, David A. |title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in The Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam |page=233 |publisher=University of California Press |date=2000 |isbn= 0-520-23265-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low-budget [[exploitation film|exploitation]] horror film, originally titled ''Slaughter'', was directed by [[Michael and Roberta Findlay]]. In an interview decades later, Roberta Findlay said the film's distributor Allan Shackleton had read about snuff films being imported from [[South America]] and retitled ''Slaughter'' to ''Snuff'', to exploit the idea;&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypress.com/article-11831-the-curse-of-her-filmography.html |title=The Curse of Her Filmography: Roberta Findlay's grindhouse legacy |work=New York Press |date=July 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also added a new ending that depicted an actress being murdered on a film set.&lt;ref name="Lees"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.martinalees.co.uk/?p=43 |author=Lees, Martina |title=Death robe of secrecy hangs around snuff films |work=Beeld |date=October 18, 2003 |accessdate=December 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303094140/http://www.martinalees.co.uk/?p=43 |archivedate=March 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }} (originally in [[Afrikaans]])&lt;/ref&gt; The promotion of ''Snuff'' on its second release suggested it featured the murder of an actress: "The film that could only be made in South America... where life is CHEAP",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawkins, Joan |title=Cutting Edge: Art-Horror and The Horrific Avant-Garde |page=136 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |date=2000 |isbn=0-8166-3413-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but that was false advertising.&lt;ref name="Lees" /&gt; Shackleton put out false newspaper clippings that reported a citizens group's crusading against the film&lt;ref name="csicop.org" /&gt; and hired people to act as protesters to picket screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/23189619/Snuff |title=Snuff |website=Britannica Online Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False snuff films==

===The ''Guinea Pig'' films===
{{Main article|Guinea Pig (film series)}}
The first two films in the Japanese ''Guinea Pig'' series are designed to look like snuff films; the video is grainy and unsteady, as if recorded by amateurs. The sixth film in the series, ''Mermaid in a Manhole'', allegedly served as an inspiration for Japanese serial killer [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]], who murdered several preschool girls in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, actor [[Charlie Sheen]] became convinced that ''[[Flower of Flesh and Blood]]'' (1985), the second film in the series, depicted an actual homicide and contacted the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;  The Bureau initiated an investigation but closed it after the series'  producers released a "making of" film demonstrating the special effects used to simulate the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=McDowell, R. |title=Movies to Die For|work= The San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 7, 1994|page= A5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cannibal Holocaust''===
{{Main article|Cannibal Holocaust}}
The Italian director [[Ruggero Deodato]] was charged after rumors that the depictions of the killing of the main actors in his film ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980) were real. He was able to clear himself of the charges after the actors made an appearance in court.&lt;ref name="In the Jungle"&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Ruggero Deodato (interviewee) |date=2003 | title=In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium=Documentary | location=Italy | publisher=Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and the genuine deaths of six animals onscreen and one off screen, issues which find ''Cannibal Holocaust'' in the midst of controversy to this day. It has also been claimed that ''Cannibal Holocaust'' is banned in over 50 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Cannibal Holocaust 25th Anniversary Edition |orig-year=1980 |others=[[Ruggero Deodato]] |page=back cover |publisher=[[VIPCO (Video Instant Picture Company)]] |location=UK |id=VIP666SE |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this has never been verified. In 2006, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine named ''Cannibal Holocaust'' as the 20th most controversial film of all-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1202224.html | title=The 25 Most Controversial Films of All-Time | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | accessdate=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stay of execution''' is a court order to temporarily suspend the execution of a court judgment or other court order.  The word "execution" does not necessarily mean the [[death penalty]]; it refers to the imposition of whatever judgment is being stayed.  

A stay can be granted automatically by operation of law or conventionally, when the parties in a civil or criminal case agree that no execution shall occur for a certain period.&lt;ref&gt;"Legal Definition of Stay of Execution", fetched from [http://www.lectlaw.com/def2/s175.htm] on 13 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; If a party [[appeal]]s a decision, any judgment issued by the original court may be stayed until the appeal is resolved.

==Death penalty stays==
In cases where the [[death penalty]] has been imposed, a stay of execution is often sought to defer the [[execution]] of the convicted person. This may occur if new evidence is discovered that will [[exoneration|exonerate]] the convicted person or in attempts to have the sentence [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] to life imprisonment. In the [[United States]], all death sentences are automatically stayed pending a [[Capital punishment in the United States#Direct review|direct review]] by an appeals court. If the death sentence is found to have been legally sound, the stay is lifted.

One example of a stay of execution in the death penalty context was the [[James Autry]] case. Autry was already strapped down to the execution table in Texas on October 4, 1983 when the order came to stop the execution. He was executed a few months later, on March 14, 1984.

U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey granted a stay of execution on November 19, 2013 in response to a motion by the lawyers of the convicted [[Joseph Paul Franklin]] that use of the drug phenobarbital in a lethal injection would constitute cruel and unusual punishment.&lt;ref&gt;punishment.http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/19/justice/missouri-franklin-execution/&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, US Supreme Court upheld an appeal court's decision to lift the stay of execution. Franklin was put to death on November 20, 2013.

'''Takashi Koshimoto''' (越本 隆志, born January 5, 1971, in [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]], [[Japan]]) is a former [[Japan]]ese professional boxer in the [[featherweight]] (126 [[Pound (mass)|lb]]) division. He is a former [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] world featherweight champion.

== Childhood and early career ==
Koshimoto's parents divorced shortly after he was born, and Koshimoto was raised single-handedly by his father. He played baseball during his early teens, but took up boxing when his father founded a boxing gym in his local town. His father would be his trainer throughout his amateur and professional career. His amateur record was 6-6 (6 RSC).

== Professional career ==
Koshimoto made his debut in November 1992. In 1996, he won the Japanese featherweight title, which he defended 6 times before returning.

In January, 2001, he challenged [[Freddie Norwood]] for the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] featherweight title, but lost by 9th-round TKO. This was his first professional loss. Later that year, he won the OPBF featherweight title, which he defended 7 times before returning.

Koshimoto got his second world title shot on January 29, 2006, fighting [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] featherweight champion [[Injin Chi]]. He won by 12-round decision, becoming the oldest Japanese boxer to win a world title, at 35 years of age. Koshimoto was paid almost nothing for the fight, since his gym had funded all the money needed for the title match.

On July 30, 2006, he fought [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Youth Champion [[Rodolfo López]] for his first defense, losing by 7th-round TKO. Koshimoto was hospitalized after the fight, and promptly announced his retirement. His record was 39-2-2 (17KOs).

== Post retirement ==
His father and trainer, Hidetake Koshimoto, was head of the Fukuoka Boxing Gym, and he replaced his father after his retirement. He currently trains aspiring boxers at the gym.

'''''The Lucifer Principle''''' is a 1995 book by [[Howard Bloom]], in which the author argues that social groups, not individuals, are the primary "unit of selection" on [[gene]]s and human psychological development. He states that both competition between groups and competition between individuals shape the evolution of the [[genome]]. Bloom "explores the intricate relationships among genetics, human behavior, and culture" and argues that "evil is a by-product of nature's strategies for creation and that it is woven into our most basic biological fabric".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Bloom| first =Howard

It also focuses on competition between individuals for position in the '[[pecking order]]' and competition between groups for standing in pecking orders of groups.  The Lucifer Principle shows how ideas are vital in creating cohesion and cooperation in these pecking order battles. Says ''The Lucifer Principle'': "Superorganism, ideas and the pecking order...these are the primary forces behind much of human creativity and earthly good."

He claimed that "Arab pressure groups asked ever so politely that ''The Lucifer Principle'' be withdrawn from print and that nothing that I write be published again. They offered to boycott my publisher's products—all of them—worldwide. And they backed their warning with a call for my punishment in seventeen Islamic countries." Bloom states that the attorney for the [[Authors Guild]] wrote to his publishers, warning of an author boycott if the book was pulled from the shelves. The publishers asked Bloom to rewrite a chapter on Islamic violence, which led to the creation of 358 lines of footnotes attesting to the facts he presented within it,&lt;ref name=censorship/&gt; that what Bloom wrote about Islam in ''The Lucifer Principle'' is based on expertise. Bloom is a frequent guest on Iran's Press-TV, Iran's Alalam-TV, Saudi Arabia's KSA-2-TV, and even on Syria's Ekhbariya-TV.

'''''A Dissertation Concerning the Nature of True Virtue''''' is a work by American Christian [[Reformed theology|reformer]], [[theologian]], [[author]] and, [[pastor]] [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] originally published posthumously in 1765.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Edwards Center"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edwards.yale.edu/research/major-works/nature-of-true-virtue/|title=The Jonathan Edwards Center at Yale University|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was published jointly with ''[[A Dissertation Concerning the End for Which God Created the World]]''.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gwinn|first=Robert P.|title=The New [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|editor=McHenry, Robert|publisher=The [[University of Chicago]]|location=[[Chicago, Illinois]]|year=1993|volume=Four|pages=382|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{calvinism}}
In ''Virtue'', Edwards describes his views on the different levels of [[virtue]], specifically "common [[morality]]" and "true (saving) virtue."&lt;ref name="Jonathan Edwards Center" /&gt; [[God]], Edwards argues, had in mind as the end for his creation of the world His own [[Glory (religion)|glory]] and not human happiness. Thus, true virtue does not arise from self-love or from any earth-bound selflessness (these were two common views at the time) but from a desire to see God's glory displayed above all. Love of self, family, or nation is good only to the extent that it magnifies the glory of God.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt;

==History and impact==
''The Nature of True Virtue'', and its companion work, ''A Dissertation Concerning the End for Which God Created the World'', are still popular works today. Modern [[theologian]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]], who extensively studied the works of Edwards while at [[Seminary]], credits the work with awakening in him "a deep longing to be a good man."&lt;ref name="John Piper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Articles/ByDate/1978/2366_A_Personal_Encounter_with_Jonathan_Edwards/|title=A Personal Encounter with Jonathan Edwards|last=Piper|first=John|date=1978-11-01|work=The Reformed Journal|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Golet'' (SS-361)''', a [[Gato class submarine|''Gato''-class]] [[submarine]], was the only ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the [[Dolly Varden trout|golet]], a [[California]] [[trout]].  Her keel was laid down by the [[Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company]] of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin]].  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 1 August 1943 sponsored by Mrs. Wiley, wife of [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Alexander Wiley]] of [[Wisconsin]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 30 November 1943 with Lieutenant Commander James M. Clement in command.

''Golet'' was initially ordered with the ''Balao''-class. However, Manitowoc did not receive the drawings for this class from [[Electric Boat]] in time to build SS-361 through SS-364 to the new design, so they were built as ''Gato'' class. Thus, in some references, these boats are listed with the ''Balao'' class.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 1995, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

''Golet'' departed Manitowoc 19 December 1943 via the [[Mississippi River]] for [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], arriving 28 December. After shakedown training at [[Panama]] and final battle practice in [[Hawaii]]an waters, she departed [[Pearl Harbor]] on 18 March 1944 for her maiden war patrol off the [[Kurile Islands]] chain, Southern [[Hokkaidō]] and Eastern [[Honshū]], [[Japan]]. Severe combinations of fog, rain, and ice were encountered and only one ship worth a torpedo came into view. This enemy proved too fast for ''Golet'' to close to torpedo range; she returned to [[Midway Island]] on 3 May 1944.

Lieutenant Commander James S. Clark took command of ''Golet'', departed [[Midway Island]] on 28 May 1944 to patrol off northern [[Honshū]], [[Japan]], and was never heard from again.

''Golet'' had been scheduled to depart her area on 5 July and was expected at [[Midway Island]] about 12 July or 13 July. She failed to acknowledge a message sent her on 9 July and was presumed lost 26 July 1944.

Japanese antisubmarine records available after the war revealed that ''Golet'' was the probable victim of a Japanese antisubmarine attack made 14 June 1944. These records mention that the attack brought up cork, rafts, and other debris and a heavy pool of oil, all evidence of the sinking of a submarine.

The '''Whangdoodle''' is a [[legendary creature|fanciful creature]] in [[folklore]] and [[children's literature]], most notably used by British authors [[Roald Dahl]] and [[Julie Andrews]]. Popularized by a sermon parody attributed to William P. Brannan as "Where the lion roareth and the whangdoodle mourneth for her first-born," published in ''The Harp of a Thousand Strings: Or, Laughter for a Lifetime'' (1858).
Whangdoodle is also an earlier term for a "fanciful formation" or a "gadget . . . thing for which the correct name is not known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=whangdoodle&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roald Dahl books==

=== ''The Minpins'' ===
In [[Roald Dahl]]'s book ''[[The Minpins]]'', one of the main characters is warned by his mother against a forest where Whangdoodles live.

=== ''James and the Giant Peach'' ===
One of the firemen of the [[James and the Giant Peach|book]] refers to the [[centipede]] as a Whangdoodle.

=== ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' ===
In ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', [[Willy Wonka]] mentions that he saved the Oompa Loompas from Whangdoodles and various other monsters.

==The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles==
{{main article|The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles}}
A different Whangdoodle is described in the children's novel ''The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles'' by singer and actress Dame [[Julie Andrews]] (under her married name of Julie Edwards): an intelligent, ungulate-like character capable of changing color to suit its emotions, from whose hind legs grow a new and different set of bedroom slippers each year. It is introduced to the [[protagonist]]s Ben, Tom, and Lindy, and thus to the reader, by the geneticist 'Professor Savant', a scholar of the Whangdoodle and its secret domain. Attempting to visit both, the scientist and children are opposed by the [[antagonist]] 'Prock' (the Whangdoodle's second-in-command), until his resources are exhausted by their tenacity. With Prock persuaded to grant their passage, the children discover that the Whangdoodle is oppressed by want of a mate, and convince Savant to create the latter. With this done, the two Whangdoodles are wedded at a great celebration, and the children return to their home.

== The Big Rock Candy Mountain ==
Some versions of the song "[[Big Rock Candy Mountain|The Big Rock Candy Mountain]]" include a mention of a Whangdoodle singing in the titular [[hobo]]'s paradise. This is the case in the version written down and arranged by Charles and Ruth Seeger. This version is used in the Frederic Rzewski composition for violin, piano, and percussion, entitled 'Whangdoodles'.

'''Yusuf İsmail''' (1857 – July 4, 1898), also widely known as '''Youssouf Ishmaelo''', was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] professional wrestler who competed in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] as '''Yusuf Ismail the Terrible Turk''' during the 1890s. During his lifetime, his native Turks knew him as ''Şumnulu Yusuf [[Pehlivan]]''. However, writer [[Rıza Tevfik]] posthumously awarded him the honorific ''Koca'' ("great"), and thus he was later remembered as ''Koca Yusuf''.

Widely known for his massive size and brute strength, he was recognized as one of the top three strongmen in the world by Alan Calvert, pioneer of American [[weight training]], and photographer [[Edmond Desbonnet]] during the turn of the century. Prior to his arrival in the United States, he remained undefeated in his near four-year career and successfully challenged [[Evan Lewis (wrestler)|Evan "Strangler" Lewis]] for the [[American Heavyweight Championship]] in 1898. Yusuf Ismail was the original wrestler to be known as "the Terrible Turk", but several others, including [[Kızılcıklı Mahmut]] (promoted as his son)&lt;ref name="kizil"&gt;[http://10dakika.tv/index.php/portre/genel/714-kzlckl-mahmut-pehlivan.html Kızılcıklı Mahmut Pehlivan]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Armenian Americans|Armenian-American]] [[Bobby Managoff|Robert Manoogian]], also used the name throughout the first half of the 20th century.

== Biography ==
=== Early career and the "Turkish Invasion" ===
[[File:Yusuf İsmail.jpg|left|thumb|The members of the "Turkish invasion" (from left to right): Kara Osman, [[Nurullah Hasan]], French promoter Joseph Doublier, and Yusuf Ismail]]
Little is known of his early life prior to his first wrestling appearance in 1894, however, according to Scottish wrestling historian William Baxter, Yusuf Ismail was born Youssuf Ishmaelo in Bulgaria (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]) in 1857. In ''A Pictorial History of Wrestling'', the English wrestling writer Graeme Kent wrote that Yusuf Ismail was not Turkish, but French. Ismail first came to prominence when he won the [[Kırkpınar|Kırkpınar Tournament]] in 1887. [[Edmond Desbonnet]] claimed in his book ''Les Rois de la Lutte'' (1910) that the Turkish invasion began in 1894 after a wrestler named Joseph Doublier was defeated by a rival, Sabès. In search of someone who could defeat Sabès, Doublier visited Turkey and brought back three wrestlers: Kara Osman, [[Nurullah Hasan]], and the 6'2", 250-pound Yusuf Ismail. Doublier had also brought Katrancı Mehmet Pehlivan and Kurtdereli Mehmet Pehlivan to Paris a while before. In his Paris debut, Ismail defeated Sabès in four seconds. Sabès had attempted to use a front belt hold, but Ismail withstood the hold and pinned him using a chokehold.&lt;ref name="Noble"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2003-05-23-noble-en.html|title=The life and death of the Terrible Turk|accessdate=|author=Noble, Graham|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=2003-05-23|year=|month=|work=|publisher=[[Eurozine]]|pages=|language=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ismail spent the next three years in France, where he dominated opponents. A colorful figure, he was also known for his fierce pride. When rivals Antonio Pierri and Tom Cannon threatened to bring in a wrestler to defeat him, Ismail reportedly said he would cut his own throat if he was ever beaten. His match against another fellow Turk, [[Hergeleci İbrahim|Ibrahim Mahmut]], was said to be one of the "''most brutal bouts ever seen on the mat''" at the [[Cirque d'Hiver]] in Paris. Ismail became so enraged during the match that he tore at Mahmut's nostrils, broke his ribs, and twisted his arms. Although referee Tom Cannon had attempted to stop the match, only the intervention of a police inspector and six officers along with several spectators were able to separate the two. Kara Osman had been originally scheduled to face Ismail but had fallen ill, and Mahmut had taken his place. According to a rumor heard by French promoter Joseph Doublier, Osman had actually withdrawn from the match because he feared for his life because of an unspecified grudge between Ismail and himself.&lt;ref name="Noble"/&gt;

=== Tour of the United States ===
He continued to be managed by Doublier until 1898, when Antonio Pierri took him to New York. Taken on by promoter [[William A. Brady]], the two appeared at the London Theatre in New York, offering $100 to anyone who could stay in the ring with him for 15 minutes. George Bothner, a well known lightweight wrestler, was the only one to accept the challenge. Although outweighed by Ismail by at least 100 pounds, Bothner claimed that "there wasn't a man alive who could pin him on his back in 15 minutes" and accused Ismail of being an impostor "like so many other so-called terrors". Despite his bravado, Bothner was defeated by Ismail several days later and suffered a neck injury during the match. He described their encounter years later to [[Nat Fleischer]] in his book ''From Milo to Londos'' (1937):
{{Quote
|text = ''He was a modern Hercules and he knew how to apply his punishing strength, as he was as quick as a jungle cat and master of all holds. Youssuf came at me like a bull. He rushed me right off the mat into a bunch of chorus girls in the wing. The first thing I knew I found myself helpless. The Turk picked me up as if I was a kitten. Never before have I felt such terrible strength. Before I could give a wiggle or squirm he dashed me down on the boards with terrific force, knocking all the strength and wits out of me... They told me that after I had landed, Youssuf rolled me over with his foot, looked out over the audience, gave a contemptuous snort and walked off the stage. When I came to, I was a sadder, but wiser young man. Somehow or other I got into my clothes, hobbled out into the street and started to walk up Third Avenue towards my home. Youssuf had given my neck such a wrench that he almost tore it from my shoulders. It was several days before I could look in the direction I was headed''.

}}

He was undefeated prior to his arrival in New York until his disqualification in a match against [[European Greco-Roman Heavyweight Championship|World Greco-Roman Heavyweight Champion]] [[Ernest Roeber]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] on March 26, 1898.&lt;ref name="Sprechman"&gt;Sprechman, Jordan and Bill Shannon. ''This Day in New York Sports''. Champaigne, Illinois: Sports Publishing LLC, 1998. (pg. 86, 121) {{ISBN|1-57167-254-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ismail, who may have intentionally fouled himself, caused the crowd to riot when he pushed Roeber out of the ring, a raised platform, and caused him to fall headfirst onto the ground five feet below. Roeber was unconscious for several minutes, and many in the crowd believed he had been killed, causing spectators to charge into the ring. Only a small police guard under Chief of Police [[John H. McCullagh]] were able to block the crowd from entering.

Roeber was revived after a few minutes and examined by physicians for injuries. Having landed on his shoulder, it was announced that he had suffered a back injury and it was decided that he would not be able to continue. Referee Hugh Leonard awarded the match to Roeber and, with calls to "Kill the Turk" and threats of [[lynching]] from those in attendance, Ismail was escorted by police to his dressing room. Ismail's manager, William Brady, offered to stage an exhibition bout between Ismail and Tom Cannon, but McCullagh refused to allow the event to continue due to concerns of rioting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0DEFD71638E433A25754C2A9659C94699ED7CF|title=Yousouf Fouled Roeber; "The Terrible Turk," Angered by the German-American's Tactics, Pushed Him from the Platform.

Appleton and Company |year=1909 |pages=123–125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rematch between Ismail and Roeber was held at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]] on April 30. During the bout, the two began a shoving match, which caused their managers, William Brady and Martin Julian, to enter the ring. Brady and Julian, who also managed rival heavyweight boxing champions [[James J. Corbett|Jim Corbett]] and [[Bob Fitzsimmons]], began arguing over the management of their respective men. When Fitzsimmons attempted to intervene, several fans stormed the ring and referee Herman Wolff declared the match a no-contest before the event could once again end in a near-riot. Opera House management closed the venue to wrestling events soon after.&lt;ref name="Sprechman"/&gt;

Months later, Ismail defeated [[Evan Lewis (wrestler)|Evan "Strangler" Lewis]] for the [[American Heavyweight Championship]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Lewis was neither able to overcome Ismail's massive size and strength nor manage to use his [[Rear naked choke#"Sleeper Hold" in professional wrestling|sleeper hold]] during the match. Ismail had the $5,000 prize money converted to gold and carried it in a [[money belt]] along with the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brfwitness.org/?p=1281|title=The Bread Basket: The Terrible Turk|accessdate=|author=Brubaker, Paul W.|date=September–October 1985|work=|publisher=Brethren Revival Fellowship|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
Shortly after his victory over Lewis, Ismail took the first ship back to Europe, where he reportedly planned to open a [[coffee]] or [[bazaar]] in his native village near [[Shumen]]. It was on the ill-fated ''[[SS La Bourgogne]]'' that he was one of the 600 passengers who drowned when the ship sank on the morning of July 4, 1898. According to colorful accounts from the New York press, Ismail fell overboard while passengers were being evacuated to the lifeboats. Dragged underwater by the weight of his money belt, supposedly containing between $8,000 and $10,000 in gold coins, he drowned before the crew could get to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antekprizering.com/turkterribleobit.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110185817/http://www.antekprizering.com:80/turkterribleobit.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-01-10|title=Ismail Youssouf, "The Terrible Turk" Obituary|accessdate=|author=|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=1898-07-29|year=|month=|work=|publisher=Evening Wisconsin|pages=|language=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible but True''.
