The '''Absolute Infinite''' (''symbol'': Ω) is an extension of the idea of [[infinity]] proposed by [[mathematician]] [[Georg Cantor]].

It can be thought as a number which is bigger than any conceivable or inconceivable quantity, either finite or [[transfinite number|transfinite]].

Cantor linked the Absolute Infinite with [[God]],&lt;ref&gt;§3.2, {{cite journal

 | title=The role of the absolute infinite in Cantor's conception of set
 | journal=Erkenntnis
 | volume=42 | issue=3 |date=May 1995 | pages=375–402 | doi=10.1007/BF01129011 | quote=Cantor (1) took the absolute to be a manifestation of God [...] When the absolute is first introduced in Grundlagen, it is linked to God: "the true infinite or absolute, which is in God, admits no kind of determination" (Cantor 1883b, p. 175) This is not an incidental remark, for Cantor is very explicit and insistent about the relation between the absolute and God.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that it had various [[mathematical]] properties, including the [[reflection principle]]: every property of the Absolute Infinite is also held by some smaller object.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinity: New Research and Frontiers'' by Michael Heller and W. Hugh Woodin (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PVNbIGS37wMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cantor's view ==
Cantor said:

{{quote|The actual infinite was distinguished by three relations: first, as it is realized in the supreme perfection, in the completely independent, extraworldly existence, in Deo, where I call it absolute infinite or simply absolute; second to the extent that it is represented in the dependent, creatural world; third as it can be conceived in abstracto in thought as a mathematical magnitude, number or ordertype. In the latter two relations, where it obviously reveals itself as limited and capable for further proliferation and hence familiar to the finite, I call it ''[[Transfinite number|Transfinitum]]'' and strongly contrast it with the absolute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uni-siegen.de/fb6/phima/lehre/phima10/quellentexte/handout-phima-teil4b.pdf&lt;br/&gt;Translated quote from German: {{quote|Es wurde das Aktual-Unendliche (A-U.) nach drei Beziehungen unterschieden: erstens, sofern es in der höchsten Vollkommenheit, im völlig unabhängigen außerweltlichen Sein, in Deo realisiert ist, wo ich es Absolut Unendliches oder kurzweg Absolutes nenne; zweitens, sofern es in der abhängigen, kreatürlichen Welt vertreten ist; drittens, sofern es als mathematische Größe, Zahl oder Ordnungstypus vom Denken in abstracto aufgefaßt werden kann. In den beiden letzten Beziehungen, wo es offenbar als beschränktes, noch weiterer Vermehrung fähiges und insofern dem Endlichen verwandtes A.-U. sich darstellt, nenne ich es ''Transfinitum'' und setze es dem Absoluten strengstens entgegen.}}[Ca-a, p. 378].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to [[Richard Dedekind]] (text in square brackets not present in original):{{refn|''Gesammelte Abhandlungen'',&lt;ref&gt;''Gesammelte Abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen Inhalts'', Georg Cantor, ed. Ernst Zermelo, with biography by Adolf Fraenkel; orig. pub. Berlin: Verlag von Julius Springer, 1932; reprinted Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1962, and Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1980, {{ISBN|3-540-09849-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Georg Cantor, ed. Ernst Zermelo, Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1962, pp. 443–447; translated into English in ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931'', ed. Jean van Heijenoort, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1967, pp. 113–117.  These references both purport to be a letter from Cantor to Dedekind, dated July 28, 1899.  However, as [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] has discovered,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/home/services/pdfterms/?ID=516899 The Rediscovery of the Cantor-Dedekind Correspondence]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, I.

{{quotation|
A [[cardinal number|multiplicity]] is called [[well-ordered]] if it fulfills the condition that every sub-multiplicity has a first [[element (mathematics)|element]]; such a multiplicity I call for short a "sequence".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I envisage the system of all [ordinal] numbers and denote it ''Ω''.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The system ''Ω'' in its natural ordering according to magnitude is a "sequence".&lt;br /&gt;
Now let us adjoin 0 as an additional element to this sequence, and place it, obviously, in the first position; then we obtain a sequence ''Ω′'':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
0, 1, 2, 3, ... &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1, ..., &amp;gamma;, ...
&lt;br /&gt;
of which one can readily convince oneself that every number γ occurring in it is the type [i.e., order-type] of the sequence of all its preceding elements (including 0).  (The sequence ''Ω'' has this property first for ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1. [ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1 should be ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.])&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now ''Ω&amp;prime;'' (and therefore also ''Ω'') cannot be a consistent multiplicity. For if ''Ω&amp;prime;'' were consistent, then as a well-ordered set, a number ''δ'' would correspond to it which would be greater than all numbers of the system ''Ω''; the number ''δ'', however, also belongs to the system ''Ω'', because it comprises all numbers. Thus ''δ'' would be greater than ''δ'', which is a contradiction. Therefore:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''The system Ω of all [ordinal] numbers is an inconsistent, absolutely infinite multiplicity.''}}

== The Burali-Forti paradox ==
{{main|Burali-Forti paradox}}
The idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems [[paradoxical]] to many. This is related to [[Burali-Forti paradox|Cesare Burali-Forti's "paradox"]] which states that there can be no greatest [[ordinal number]]. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.

More generally, as noted by [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|A. W. Moore]], there can be no end to the process of [[set (mathematics)|set]] formation, and thus no such thing as the ''totality of all sets'', or the ''set hierarchy''.  Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the [[cumulative hierarchy|hierarchy]] and thus failing to contain every set.

A standard solution to this problem is found in [[Zermelo set theory|Zermelo's set theory]], which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property ''and lie in some given set'' (Zermelo's [[Axiom schema of specification|Axiom of Separation]]). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.

While this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed, [[naive set theory]] might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a [[Class (set theory)|class]] to describe arbitrary (possibly "large") entities, these predicates of the [[meta-language]] may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. For example, the class of all sets would be a [[proper class]]. This is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in [[set theory]] and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics such as [[New Foundations#How NF.28U.29 avoids the set-theoretic paradoxes|New Foundations]] by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].

'''Archetypal psychology''' was initiated as a distinct movement in the early 1970s by [[James Hillman]], a psychologist who trained in analytical psychology and became the first Director of the Jung Institute in Zurich. Hillman reports that archetypal psychology emerged partly from the [[Analytical psychology|Jungian tradition]] whilst drawing also from other traditions and authorities such as Henry Corbin, Vico and Plotinus.

Archetypal psychology relativizes and deliteralizes the notion of ego and focuses on what it calls the ''psyche'', or ''soul'', and the deepest patterns of psychic functioning, "the fundamental fantasies that animate all life" (Moore, in Hillman, 1991). Archetypal psychology likens itself to a polytheistic mythology in that it attempts to recognize the myriad fantasies and [[mythology|myths]] – gods, goddesses, demigods, mortals and animals – that shape and are shaped by our psychological lives. In this framework the ego is but one psychological fantasy within an assemblage of fantasies. Archetypal psychology is, along with the classical and developmental schools, one of the three schools of post-Jungian psychology outlined by [[Andrew Samuels]] (see Samuels, 1995).

==Influences==
The main influence on the development of archetypal psychology is [[Carl Jung]]'s [[analytical psychology]]. It is strongly influenced by [[Greek philosophy|Classical Greek]], [[Renaissance]], and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] ideas and thought. Influential artists, poets, philosophers and psychologists include: [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Henry Corbin]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[Petrarch]], and [[Paracelsus]]. Though all different in their theories and psychologies, they appear to be unified by their common concern for the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] – the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].

==C. G. Jung==
Carl Gustav Jung was a Swiss psychologist who was the first father of archetypal psychology. [[Jungian archetypes]] are thought patterns that find worldwide parallels in individuals or entire cultures. Archai appear in dreams, religions, the arts, and social customs in all people and they manifest impulsively in mental disorders.&lt;ref name="Hillman, J. 1985"&gt;Hillman, J. (1985). Archetypal psychology a brief account. Dallas, TX: Spring Publications&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jung archetypal ideas and patterns reside within the [[collective unconscious]], which is a blueprint inherent in every individual, as opposed to the personal [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]], which contains a single individual's [[Psychological repression|repressed]] ideas, desires and memories as described by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]. What differentiates Jungian psychology from archetypal psychology is that Jung believed archetypes are cultural, anthropological, and transcend the empirical world of time and place, and are not phenomenal. On the contrary, Archetypal psychology views archetypes to always be phenomenal.&lt;ref name="Hillman, J. 1985"/&gt;

==Henry Corbin==
[[Henry Corbin]], a French scholar and philosopher, is the second father of archetypal psychology. Corbin created the idea of the existence of the ''mundus imaginalis'' which is a distinct field of imaginable realities and offers an [[ontological]] mode of location of archetypes of the psyche.{{clarify|what is meant by "an ontological mode of location of archetypes of the psyche"?|date=June 2013}} The mundus imaginalis provided an evaluative and cosmic grounding for archetypes. The second contribution Corbin made to the field was the idea that archetypes are accessible to imagination and first present themselves as images, so the procedure of archetypal psychology must be rhetorical and poetic, without logical reasoning, and the goal in therapy should be to restore the patient's imaginable realities. Therefore, the goal of therapy is the middle ground of psychic realities, a development of a sense of soul. Also, according to Corbin, the method of therapy is the cultivation of imagination.&lt;ref name="Hillman, J. 1985"/&gt;

==Edward Casey==
[[Edward S. Casey]] is attributed with distinguishing archetypal psychology from other theories by explaining an image as a way of seeing rather than something seen. According to Casey an image is only perceived by imagining because an image is not what one sees but the way one sees. He also states that imagination is an activity of soul and not just a human faculty. An image appears to be more profound, more powerful, and more beautiful than the comprehension of it. This explains the drive behind the arts which provide disciplines that can actualize the complexity of the image.&lt;ref name="Hillman, J. 1985"/&gt;

==James Hillman==

Hillman (1975) sketches a brief lineage of archetypal psychology.
:''By calling upon Jung to begin with, I am partly acknowledging the fundamental debt that archetypal psychology owes him. He is the immediate ancestor in a long line that stretches back through Freud, [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]], [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Marsilio Ficino|Ficino]], [[Plotinus]], and [[Plato]] to [[Heraclitus]] – and with even more branches yet to be traced (p. xvii).''

===Polytheistic psychology===
Thomas Moore says of [[James Hillman]]'s teaching that he "portrays the psyche as inherently multiple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hillman|first=James|title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman.|year=1989|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-092101-3|pages=36|editor=Thomas Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hillman's archetypal/polytheistic view, the psyche or soul has many directions and sources of meaning – and this can feel like an ongoing state of conflict – a struggle with one's [[Daemon (mythology)|daimones]]. According to Hillman, "polytheistic psychology can give sacred differentiation to our psychic turmoil.…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hillman|first=James|title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman.|year=1989|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-092101-3|pages=41|editor=Thomas Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillman states that
:The power of myth, its reality, resides precisely in its power to seize and influence psychic life. The Greeks knew this so well, and so they had no depth psychology and psychopathology such as we have. They had myths. And we have no myths – instead, depth psychology and psychopathology. Therefore... psychology shows myths in modern dress and myths show our depth psychology in ancient dress."&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, J. (1990) ''Oedipus Variations: Studies in Literature and Psychoanalysis''. Spring p.90&lt;/ref&gt;
Hillman qualifies his many references to gods as differing from a literalistic approach saying that for him they are ''aides memoires'', i.e. sounding boards employed "for echoing life today or as bass chords giving resonance to the little melodies of life."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;SPRING Journal 56, p.5 (1994) Spring Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Hillman further insists that he does not view the pantheon of gods as a 'master matrix' against which we should measure today and thereby decry modern loss of richness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

===Psyche or soul===
{{Main|Psyche (psychology)|Soul}}
Hillman says he has been critical of the 20th century's psychologies (e.g. [[biological psychology]], [[behaviorism]], [[cognitive psychology]]) that have adopted a natural scientific philosophy and [[praxis (process)|praxis]]. His main criticisms include that they are reductive, materialistic, and literal; they are psychologies without psyche, without soul. Accordingly, Hillman's oeuvre has been an attempt to restore psyche to its proper place in psychology. Hillman sees the soul at work in imagination, fantasy, myth and metaphor. He also sees soul revealed in [[psychopathology]], in the symptoms of psychological disorders. Psyche-pathos-logos is the "speech of the suffering soul" or the soul's suffering of meaning. A great portion of Hillman's thought attempts to attend to the speech of the soul as it is revealed via images and fantasies.

Hillman has his own definition of soul. Primarily, he notes that soul is not a "thing", not an entity. Nor is it something that is located "inside" a person. Rather, soul is "a perspective rather than a substance, a viewpoint towards things… (it is) reflective; it mediates events and makes differences…"(1975). Soul is not to be located in the brain or in the head, for example (where most modern psychologies place it), but human beings are in psyche. The world, in turn, is the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|anima mundi]], or the world ensouled. Hillman often quotes a phrase coined by the Romantic poet John Keats: "call the world the vale of soul-making."

Additionally, Hillman (1975) says he observes that soul:
:refers to the deepening of events into experiences; second the significance of soul makes possible, whether in love or religious concern, derives from its special relationship with death. And third, by soul I mean the imaginative possibility in our natures the experiencing through reflective speculation, dream, image, fantasy&amp;mdash;that mode which recognizes all realities as primarily symbolic or metaphorical.

The notion of soul as imaginative possibility, in relation to the archai or root metaphors, is what Hillman has termed the "poetic basis of mind".

===Dream analysis===
{{Main|Dream analysis}}
Because Hillman's archetypal psychology is concerned with fantasy, myth, and image, it is not surprising that dreams are considered to be significant in relation to soul and soul-making. Hillman does not believe that dreams are simply random residue or flotsam from waking life (as advanced by physiologists), but neither does he believe that dreams are compensatory for the struggles of waking life, or are invested with "secret" meanings of how one should live (à la Jung). Rather, "dreams tell us where we are, not what to do" (1979). Therefore, Hillman is against the 20th century traditional interpretive methods of dream analysis. Hillman's approach is phenomenological rather than analytic (which breaks the dream down into its constituent parts) and interpretive/hermeneutic (which may make a dream image "something other" than what it appears to be in the dream). His dictum with regard to dream content and process is "Stick with the image."

Hillman  (1983) describes his position succinctly:
:For instance, a black snake comes in a dream, a great big black snake, and you can spend a whole hour with this black snake talking about the devouring mother, talking about anxiety, talking about the repressed sexuality, talking about the natural mind, all those interpretive moves that people make, and what is left, what is vitally important, is what this snake is doing, this crawling huge black snake that's walking into your life…and the moment you've defined the snake, you've interpreted it, you've lost the snake, you've stopped it.… The task of analysis is to keep the snake there.…

The snake in the dream does not become something else: it is none of the things Hillman mentioned, and neither is it a penis, as Hillman says Freud might have maintained, nor the serpent from the [[Garden of Eden]], as Hillman thinks Jung might have mentioned. It is not something someone can look up in a dream dictionary; its meaning has not been given in advance. Rather, the black snake is the black snake. Approaching the dream snake [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenologically]] simply means describing the snake and attending to how the snake appears as a snake in the dream. It is a huge black snake, that is given. But are there other snakes in the dream? If so, is it bigger than the other snakes? Smaller? Is it a black snake among green snakes? Or is it alone? What is the setting, a desert or a rain forest?  Is the snake getting ready to feed? Shedding its skin? Sunning itself on a rock? All of these questions are elicited from the primary image of the snake in the dream, and as such can be rich material revealing the psychological life of the dreamer and the life of the psyche spoken through the dream.

===''The Soul's Code''===
Hillman's book, ''The Soul's Code: In Search of Character and Calling'', outlines an "acorn theory of the soul." His theory states that each individual holds the potential for their unique possibilities inside themselves already, much as an acorn holds the pattern for an oak, invisible within itself. It argues against the parental fallacy whereby our parents are seen as crucial in determining who we are by supplying us with genetic material and behavioral patterns. Instead the book suggests for a reconnection with what is invisible within us, our [[daimon]] or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or acorn and the acorn's calling to the wider world of nature. It argues against theories which attempt to map life into phases, suggesting that this is counter-productive and makes people feel like they are failing to live up to what is normal. This in turn produces a truncated, normalized society of soulless mediocrity where evil is not allowed but injustice is everywhere – a society that cannot tolerate eccentricity or the further reaches of life experiences but sees them as illnesses to be medicated out of existence.

Hillman diverges from Jung and his idea of the Self. Hillman sees Jung as too prescriptive and argues against the idea of life-maps by which to try to grow properly.

Instead, Hillman suggests a reappraisal of each individual's childhood and present life to try to find the individual's particular calling, the acorn of the soul. He has written that he is the one to help precipitate a re-souling of the world in the space between rationality and psychology. He replaces the notion of growing up, with the myth of growing down from the [[womb]] into a messy, confusing earthy world. Hillman rejects formal logic in favour of reference to case histories of well known people and considers his arguments to be in line with the  ''[[puer aeternus]]'' or eternal youth whose brief burning existence could be seen in the work of romantic poets like [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] and in recently deceased young rock stars like [[Jeff Buckley]] or [[Kurt Cobain]]. Hillman also rejects [[causality]] as a defining framework and suggests in its place a shifting form of fate whereby events are not inevitable but bound to be expressed in some way dependent on the character of the soul or acorn in question.

==Psychopathology and therapy==
Psychopathology is viewed as the psyche's independent ability to create morbidity, disorder, illness, abnormality and suffering in any part of its behavior and to imagine and experience life  through a deformed perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, James. Re-Visioning Psychology. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975 [Harper Colophon edition, 1977].&lt;/ref&gt;

Archetypal psychology follows the following procedures for therapy:
*Regular meetings
*Face-to-face
*The therapist chooses the location
*A fee is charged
These procedures may be modified depending on the therapist and the client. In therapy both the therapist and client explore the client's  habitual behavior, feelings, fantasies, dreams, memories, and ideas. The goal of therapy is the improvement of the client and termination of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, James. Loose Ends: Primary Papers in Archetypal Psychology. New York/Zurich: Spring Publications, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Goals are not stated for therapy.&lt;ref name="Hillman, J. 1985"/&gt;

[[File:blackstones-ratio.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[William Blackstone]] with a quote of Blackstone's ratio.]]

In [[criminal law]], '''Blackstone's ratio''' (also known as '''the Blackstone ratio''' or '''Blackstone's formulation''') is the idea that:

{{quote|It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/blackstone-commentaries-on-the-laws-of-england-in-four-books-vol-2/simple|title=Commentaries on the laws of England|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As expressed by the English jurist [[William Blackstone]] in his seminal work, ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', published in the 1760s.

The idea subsequently became a staple of legal thinking in Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions and continues to be a topic of debate. There is also a long pre-history of similar sentiments going back centuries in a variety of legal traditions. The message that government and the courts must err on the side of innocence has remained constant.{{Citation needed|reason=This is both a sweeping declaration unlimited in time and unsupported by the text below, and unclear|date=October 2018}}

==In Blackstone's ''Commentaries''==
The phrase, repeated widely and usually in isolation, comes from a longer passage, the fourth in a series of five discussions of policy by Blackstone:

{{quote|Fourthly, all presumptive evidence of felony should be admitted cautiously, for the law holds that it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer. And Sir Matthew Hale in particular lays down two rules most prudent and necessary to be observed: 1. Never to convict a man for stealing the goods of a person unknown, merely because he will give no account how he came by them, unless an actual felony be proved of such goods; and, 2. Never to convict any person of murder or manslaughter till at least the body be found dead; on account of two instances he mentions where persons were executed for the murder of others who were then alive but missing.}}

The phrase was absorbed by the British legal system, becoming a maxim by the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt; Re Hobson, 1 Lew. C. C. 261, 168 Eng. Rep. 1034 (1831) (Holroyd, J.).&lt;/ref&gt; It was also absorbed into American common law, cited repeatedly by that country's Founding Fathers, later becoming a standard drilled into law students all the way into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;G. Tim Aynesworth, An illogical truism, Austin Am.-Statesman, April 18, 1996, at A14.  Specifically, it is "drilled into [first year law students'] head[s] over and over again."  Hurley Green, Sr., Shifting Scenes, Chi. Independent Bull., January 2, 1997, at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ben-franklin-blackstone.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]]'s version of Blackstone's Ratio is very commonly quoted]]
Other commentators have echoed the principle; [[Benjamin Franklin]] stated it as, "it is better 100 guilty Persons should escape than that one innocent Person should suffer".&lt;ref&gt;9 Benjamin Franklin, Works 293 (1970), Letter from Benjamin Franklin to Benjamin Vaughan (14 March 1785)&lt;/ref&gt;

Defending [[British Army|British soldiers]] charged with murder for their role in the [[Boston Massacre]], [[John Adams]] also expanded upon the rationale behind Blackstone's Ratio when he stated: 

{{quote|It is more important that innocence should be protected, than it is, that guilt be punished; for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world, that all of them cannot be punished.... when innocence itself, is brought to the bar and condemned, especially to die, the subject will exclaim, 'it is immaterial to me whether I behave well or ill, for virtue itself is no security.' And if such a sentiment as this were to take hold in the mind of the subject that would be the end of all security whatsoever}}

Given that Hale and Fortescue in English law had made similar statements previously, some kind of explanation is required for the enormous popularity and influence of the phrase across all the Anglo-Saxon legal systems. Cullerne Bown has argued that it "...can be seen as a new kind of buttress of the law that was required in a new kind of society." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1365712718798387|title=Killing Kaplanism: Flawed methodologies, the standard of proof and modernity|publisher=The International Journal of Evidence &amp; Proof}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quantitativejurisprudence.com|title="Quantitative Jurisprudence" blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic expressions of the principle==

The immediate precursors of Blackstone's Ratio in English law were articulations by [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]] (about 100 years earlier) and [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] (about 200 years before that), both influential jurists in their time.

Hale wrote, "for it is better five guilty persons should escape unpunished, than one innocent person should die." Fortescue's ''De Laudibus Legum Angliae'' (c. 1470) states that "one would much rather that twenty guilty persons should escape the punishment of death, than that one innocent person should be condemned and suffer capitally." &lt;ref name=Volokh&gt;Alexander Volokh, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 300 years before Fortescue, the Jewish legal theorist [[Maimonides]] wrote that "the Exalted One has shut this door" against the use of presumptive evidence, for "it is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death."&lt;ref name=Volokh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269-271 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein(Rabbi.)2006"&gt;{{cite book

Maimonides argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would progressively lead to convictions merely "according to the judge's caprice" and was expounding on both [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 23:7 (''"the innocent and righteous slay thou not''") and an Islamic text, [Jami'] of at-Tirmidhi.

[Jami'] of at-Tirmidhi quotes Muhammad as saying, "Avoid legal punishments as far as possible, and if there are any doubts in the case then use them, for it is better for a judge to err towards leniency than towards punishment".  Another similar expression reads, "Invoke doubtfulness in evidence during prosecution to avoid legal punishments".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hadith.al-islam.com/Page.aspx?pageid=192&amp;TOCID=951&amp;BookID=37&amp;PID=2650 ''Exegesis of Sunan at-Tirmidhi - the Book of Punishments''],  Abu `Isa Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi, 884 C.E.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other statements, some even older, which seem to express similar sentiments have been compiled by Volokh. A vaguely similar principle, echoing the number ten and the idea that it would be preferable that many guilty people escape consequences than a few innocents suffer them, appears as early as the narrative of the Cities of the Plain in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (at 18:23-32),&lt;ref name=Volokh&gt;Alexander Volokh, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
{{Biblesource | Genesis | 18:23 | WEB | text=Abraham drew near, and said, "Will you consume the righteous with the wicked? What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?}} ... {{Biblesource | Genesis | 18:32 | WEB | text=What if ten are found there?" He [The Lord] said, "I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."}}
}}

With respect to the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom,]] the text describes it as ultimately being destroyed, but only after the rescuing of most of [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s family, the aforementioned "righteous" among a city or overwhelming wickedness who, despite the overwhelming guilt of their fellows, were sufficient by their mere presence to warrant a "stay of execution" of sorts for the entire region, slated to be destroyed for being uniformly a place of sin. The text continues, 

{{quote|
{{Biblesource | Genesis | 19:27-28 | WEB | text=27 Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the Lord. 28 He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.}}

{{Biblesource | Genesis | 19:29 | WEB | text=29 So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.}}
}}

Similarly, on 3 October 1692, while decrying the [[Salem witch trials]], [[Increase Mather]] adapted Fortescue's statement and wrote, "It were better that Ten Suspected Witches should escape, than that one Innocent Person should be Condemned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits |year=1693 |page= 66 |url=http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/speccol/mather/mather.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In current scholarship==

Particularly in the United States, Blackstone’s ratio continues to be an active source of debate in jurisprudence. For example Daniel Epps and Laura Appleman exchanged arguments against and in favour of its continuing influence in the Harvard Law Review in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Consequences of Error in Criminal Justice |url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2015/02/the-consequences-of-error-in-criminal-justice/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Tragedy of Errors: Blackstone, Procedural Asymmetry, and Criminal Justice |url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2015/02/a-tragedy-of-errors-blackstone-procedural-asymmetry-and-criminal-justice/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints in politics==
[[Authoritarianism|Authoritarian]] personalities tend to take the opposite view; [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] is believed to have stated that "it is better that ten innocent men suffer than one guilty man escape".&lt;ref name=Volokh /&gt;  [[Pol Pot]] made similar remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Locard, Henri. ''Pol Pot's Little Red Book: The Sayings of Angkar''. Silkworm Books, 2004. pp. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] referenced this principle while saying that it is not applicable to the context of preventing terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.faz.net/s/Rub594835B672714A1DB1A121534F010EE1/Doc~E307DE59120324224ACCD7CA59A6F1C17~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html |title=Schäuble: Zur Not auch gegen Unschuldige vorgehen |publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|FAZ]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former American [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] said that his support of American use of "enhanced interrogation techniques"  against suspected terrorists was unchanged by the fact that 25% of CIA detainees subject to that treatment were later proven to be innocent, including one who died of hypothermia in [[CIA]] custody.  "I'm more concerned with bad guys who got out and released than I am with a few that in fact were innocent."  Asked whether the 25% margin was too high, Cheney responded, "I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective. ...  I'd do it again in a minute."&lt;ref&gt;  [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/12/cheney-alright-with-torture-of-innocent-people.html "Dick Cheney Simply Does Not Care That the CIA Tortured Innocent People"], ''[[New York Magazine]]''. December 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal columnist [[Ezra Klein]] supported California's SB 967 "Affirmative Consent" law with the same reasoning as Cheney's supported "enhanced interrogation techniques". While claiming the law was "terrible" and could be used to punish people who did not commit rape, Klein states "its overreach is precisely its value" and "ugly problems don't always have pretty solutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6966847/yes-means-yes-is-a-terrible-bill-and-i-completely-support-it|title="Yes Means Yes" is a terrible law, and I completely support it|first=Ezra|last=Klein|date=13 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Volokh cites an apparent questioning of the principle, with the tale of a Chinese professor who responds, "Better for whom?"&lt;ref name="Volokh"/&gt;

'''Cycle time variation''' is a metric and philosophy for continuous improvement with the aim of driving down the deviations in the time it takes to produce successive units on a production line.&lt;ref&gt;Schonberger, Richard J. (2001). Let's Fix It! Free Press. {{ISBN|0-7432-1551-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It supports organizations' application of [[lean manufacturing]] or [[lean production]] by eliminating wasteful expenditure of resources. It is distinguished from some of the more common applications by its different focus of creating a structure for progressively reducing the sources of internal variation that leads to [[workarounds]] and disruption causing these [[wastes]] to accumulate in the first place.  Although it is often used as an indicator of lean progress, its use promotes a structured approach to reducing disruption that impacts efficiency, quality, and value.&lt;ref name=breaking&gt;Ruffa, Stephen A.; Michael J. Perozzello (2000). ''Breaking the Cost Barrier: A Proven Approach to Managing and Implementing Lean Manufacturing''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-38136-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''De-anonymization''' is a strategy in data mining in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other sources of data to  the anonymous data source. The term became popular in 2006 when Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov entered a  hosted by Netflix, and applied their de-anonymization techniques to successfully identify Netflix data for a number of specific members.

More and more data are becoming publicly available over the Internet. These data are released after applying some anonymization techniques like removing  such as names, addresses and social security numbers to ensure the sources' privacy. This assurance of privacy allows the government to legally share limited data sets with third parties without requiring written permission. Such data has proved to be very valuable for researchers, particularly in health care. However, as the Netflix contest dramatically revealed so much of data is available, even after anonymization, that a specific individual’s identity could be re-discovered.

==Examples of de-anonymization==
*"Researchers at MIT and the , in Belgium, analyzed data on 1.5&amp;nbsp;million cellphone users in a small European country over a span of 15&amp;nbsp;months and found that just four points of reference, with fairly low spatial and temporal resolution, was enough to uniquely identify 95 percent of them. In other words, to extract the complete location information for a single person from an “anonymized” data set of more than a million people, all you would need to do is place him or her within a couple of hundred yards of a cellphone transmitter, sometime over the course of an hour, four times in one year. A few Twitter posts would probably provide all the information you needed, if they contained specific information about the person’s whereabouts."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55705">'''Enactivism''' argues that [[cognition]] arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting [[organism]] and its environment.&lt;ref name="Evan Thompson"/&gt; It claims that our environment is one which we selectively create through our capacities to interact with the world.&lt;ref name=Rowlands/&gt; "Organisms do not passively receive information from their environments, which they then translate into internal representations. Natural cognitive systems...participate in the generation of meaning ...engaging in transformational and not merely informational interactions: ''they enact a world''."&lt;ref name=Jaegher1/&gt; These authors suggest that the increasing emphasis upon enactive terminology presages a new era in thinking about cognitive science.&lt;ref name=Jaegher1/&gt; How the actions involved in enactivism relate to age-old questions about [[free will]] remains a topic of active debate.&lt;ref name=Manetti/&gt;

The term 'enactivism' is close in meaning to 'enaction', defined as "the manner in which a subject of perception creatively matches its actions to the requirements of its situation".&lt;ref name=Tascano0/&gt; The introduction of the term ''enaction'' in this context is attributed to  [[Francisco Varela]], [[Evan Thompson]], and [[Eleanor Rosch]],&lt;ref name=Tascano0/&gt;&lt;ref name=RWilson/&gt; who proposed the name to "emphasize the growing conviction that cognition is not the representation of a pre-given world by a pre-given mind but is rather the enactment of a world and a mind on the basis of a history of the variety of actions that a being in the world performs".&lt;ref name=Varela/&gt; This was further developed by Thompson and others,&lt;ref name="Evan Thompson"/&gt; to place emphasis upon the idea that experience of the world is a result of mutual interaction between the sensorimotor capacities of the organism and its environment.&lt;ref name=RWilson/&gt;

The initial emphasis of enactivism upon sensorimotor skills has been criticized as "cognitively marginal",&lt;ref name=ClarkA/&gt; but it has been extended to apply to higher level cognitive activities, such as social interactions.&lt;ref name="Jaegher1"/&gt; "In the enactive view,... knowledge is constructed: it is constructed by an agent through its sensorimotor interactions with its environment, co-constructed between and within living species through their meaningful interaction with each other. In its most abstract form, knowledge is co-constructed between human individuals in socio-linguistic interactions...Science is a particular form of social knowledge construction...[that] allows us to perceive and predict events beyond our immediate cognitive grasp...and also to construct further, even more powerful scientific knowledge."&lt;ref name=Rohde/&gt;

Enactivism is closely related to [[situated cognition]] and [[embodied cognition]], and is presented as an alternative to [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], [[computationalism]], and [[Cartesian dualism]].

==Philosophical aspects&lt;!--'Enaction (philosophy)' redirects here--&gt;==

Enactivism is one of  a cluster of related theories sometimes known as the ''4Es''.&lt;ref name=Gallagher/&gt; As described by [[Mark Rowlands]], mental processes are:
* '''Embodied''' involving more than the brain, including a more general involvement of bodily structures and processes.
* '''Embedded''' functioning only in a related external environment.
* '''Enacted''' involving not only neural processes, but also things an organism ''does''.
* '''Extended''' into the organism's environment.

Enactivism proposes an alternative to [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] as a philosophy of mind, in that it emphasises the interactions between mind, body and the environment, seeing them all as inseparably intertwined in mental processes.&lt;ref name=EThompson/&gt; The self arises as part of the process of an embodied entity interacting with the environment in precise ways determined by its physiology.   In this sense, individuals can be seen to "grow into" or arise from their interactive role with the world.&lt;ref name=Burman/&gt;
:"Enaction is the idea that organisms create their own experience through their actions. Organisms are not passive receivers of input from the environment, but are actors in the environment such that what they experience is shaped by how they act."&lt;ref name=Hutchins/&gt;

In ''The Tree of Knowledge'' Maturana &amp; Varela proposed the term ''enactive''&lt;ref name=Maturana/&gt; "to evoke the view of knowledge that what is known is brought forth, in contraposition to the more classical views of either cognitivism&lt;ref group=Note name=Cognitivism/&gt; or connectionism.&lt;ref group=Note name=Connectionism/&gt; They see enactivism as providing a middle ground between the two extremes of [[representationalism]] and [[solipsism]]. They seek to "confront the problem of understanding how our existence-the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] of our living- is coupled to a surrounding world which appears filled with regularities that are at every instant the result of our biological and social histories.... to find a ''via media'': to understand the regularity of the world we are experiencing at every moment, but without any point of reference independent of ourselves that would give certainty to our descriptions and cognitive assertions.  Indeed the whole mechanism of generating ourselves, as describers and observers tells us that our world, as the world which we bring forth in our coexistence with others, will always have precisely that mixture of regularity and mutability, that combination of solidity and shifting sand, so typical of human experience when we look at it up close."[''Tree of Knowledge'', p.&amp;nbsp;241]

Enactivism also addresses the [[hard problem of consciousness]], referred to by Thompson as part of the ''[[explanatory gap]]'' in explaining how consciousness and subjective experience are related to brain and body.&lt;ref name=EThompson2/&gt;  "The problem with the dualistic concepts of consciousness and life in standard formulations of the hard problem is that they exclude each other by construction".&lt;ref name=EThompson3/&gt; Instead, according to Thompson's view of enactivism, the study of consciousness or [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] as exemplified by [[Husserl]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] is to complement science and its objectification of the world. "The whole universe of science is built upon the world as directly experienced, and if we want to subject science itself to rigorous scrutiny and arrive at a precise assessment of its meaning and scope, we must begin by reawakening the basic experience of the world of which science is the second-order expression" (Merleau-Ponty, ''The phenomenology of perception'' as quoted by Thompson, p.&amp;nbsp;165). In this interpretation, enactivism asserts that science is formed or enacted as part of humankind's interactivity with its world, and by embracing phenomenology "science itself is properly situated in relation to the rest of human life and is thereby secured on a sounder footing."&lt;ref name=EThompson4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt;

Enaction has been seen as a move to conjoin [[representationalism]] with [[phenomenalism]], that is, as adopting a [[constructivist epistemology]], an epistemology centered upon the active participation of the subject in constructing reality.&lt;ref name=Mutelesi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiari/&gt; However, 'constructivism' focuses upon more than a simple 'interactivity' that could be described as a minor adjustment to 'assimilate' reality or 'accommodate' to it.&lt;ref name=Glaserfeld/&gt; Constructivism looks upon interactivity as a radical, creative, revisionist process in which the knower ''constructs'' a personal 'knowledge system' based upon their experience and tested by its viability in practical encounters with their environment. Learning is a result of perceived anomalies that produce dissatisfaction with existing conceptions.&lt;ref name=Glasersfeld2/&gt;

How does constructivism relate to enactivism? From the above remarks it can be seen that [[Ernst von Glasersfeld|Glasersfeld]] expresses an interactivity between the knower and the known quite acceptable to an enactivist, but does not emphasize  the structured probing of the environment by the knower that leads to the "perturbation relative to some expected result" that then leads to a new understanding.&lt;ref name=Glasersfeld2/&gt; It is this probing activity, especially where it is not accidental but deliberate, that characterizes enaction, and invokes ''affect'',&lt;ref name=Ward2/&gt; that is, the motivation and planning that lead to doing and to fashioning the probing, both observing and modifying the environment, so that "perceptions and nature condition one another through generating one another."&lt;ref name=Diettrich/&gt; The questioning nature of this probing activity is not an emphasis of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] and Glasersfeld.

Sharing enactivism's stress upon both action and embodiment in the incorporation of knowledge, but giving Glasersfeld's mechanism of viability an [[Introduction to evolution|evolutionary]] emphasis,&lt;ref name=Diettrich2/&gt; is [[evolutionary epistemology]]. Inasmuch as an organism must reflect its environment well enough for the organism to be able to survive in it, and to be competitive enough to be able to reproduce at sustainable rate, the structure and reflexes of the organism itself embody knowledge of its environment. This biology-inspired theory of the growth of knowledge is closely tied to [[universal Darwinism]], and is associated with evolutionary epistemologists such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Donald T. Campbell]], [[Peter Munz]], and [[Gary Cziko]].&lt;ref name=Gontier/&gt; According to Munz, "an organism is an ''embodied theory'' about its environment... Embodied theories are also no longer expressed in language, but in anatomical structures or reflex responses, etc."&lt;ref name=Gontier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Munz/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments of enactivism in the area of social neuroscience involve the proposal of ''The Interactive Brain Hypothesis''&lt;ref name=DiPaolo3&gt;
{{cite journal |url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00163/full |author1=Ezequiel Di Paolo |author2=Hanne De Jaegher |date=June 2012 |title= The Interactive Brain Hypothesis |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=7 |issue=6 |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2012.00163}}&lt;/ref&gt; where social cognition brain mechanisms, even those used in non-interactive situations, are proposed to have interactive origins.

===Enactive views of perception===
In the enactive view, perception "is not conceived as the transmission of information but more as an exploration of the world by various means. Cognition is not tied into the workings of an 'inner mind', some cognitive core, but occurs in directed interaction between the body and the world it inhabits."&lt;ref name=McGann2&gt;
{{cite book |title=Consciousness &amp; Emotion: Agency, conscious choice, and selective perception |page=184 |author1=Marek McGann |author2=Steve Torrance |chapter=Doing It and Meaning It: And the relation between the two  |isbn=9789027294616 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZk6AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184 |editor1=Ralph D. Ellis |editor2=Natika Newton }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alva Noë]] in advocating an enactive view of perception&lt;ref name=Noe&gt;
{{cite book |author=Alva Noë |title= Action in Perception |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFKvU2hPhxEC&amp;pg=PA1 |pages=1 ''ff'' |chapter=Chapter 1: The enactive approach to perception: An introduction |isbn=9780262140881 |year=2004 |publisher=MIT Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt; sought to resolve how we perceive three-dimensional objects, on the basis of two-dimensional input.  He argues that we perceive this solidity (or 'volumetricity') by appealing to patterns of sensorimotor expectations. These arise from our agent-active  'movements and interaction' with objects, or 'object-active' changes in the object itself. The solidity is perceived through our expectations and skills in knowing how the object's appearance would change with changes in how we relate to it. He saw all perception as an active exploration of the world, rather than being a passive process, something which happens to us.

Noë's idea of the role of 'expectations' in three-dimensional perception has been opposed by several philosophers, notably by [[Andy Clark]].&lt;ref name=ClarkA1/&gt; Clark points to difficulties of the enactive approach.  He points to internal processing of visual signals, for example, in the ventral and dorsal pathways, [[Two-streams hypothesis|the two-streams hypothesis]]. This results in an integrated perception of objects (their recognition and location, respectively) yet this processing cannot be described as an action or actions. In a more general criticism, Clark suggests that perception is not a matter of expectations about sensorimotor mechanisms guiding perception. Rather, although the limitations of sensorimotor mechanisms constrain perception, this sensorimotor activity is drastically filtered to fit current needs and purposes of the organism, and it is these imposed 'expectations' that govern perception, filtering for the 'relevant' details of sensorimotor input (called "sensorimotor summarizing").&lt;ref name=ClarkA1/&gt;

These sensorimotor-centered and purpose-centered views appear to agree on the general scheme but disagree on the dominance issue – is the dominant component peripheral or central. Another view, the closed-loop perception one, assigns equal a-priori dominance to the peripheral and central components. In closed-loop perception, perception emerges through the process of inclusion of an item in a motor-sensory-motor loop, i.e., a loop (or loops) connecting the peripheral and central components that are relevant to that item. The item can be a body part (in which case the loops are in steady-state) or an external object (in which case the loops are perturbed and gradually converge to a steady state). These enactive loops are always active, switching dominance by the need.

Another application of enaction to perception is analysis of the human hand. The many remarkably demanding uses of the hand are not learned by instruction, but through a history of engagements that lead to the acquisition of skills. According to one interpretation, it is suggested that "the hand [is]...an organ of cognition", not a faithful subordinate working under top-down instruction, but a partner in a "bi-directional interplay between manual and brain activity."&lt;ref name="Hutto"&gt;
{{cite book |title= Radicalizing Enactivism: Minds without content |author=[[Daniel D Hutto]], Erik Myin |pages=46 ''ff'' |chapter=A helping hand |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAj-96LlBuMC&amp;pg=PA46 |isbn= 9780262018548 |year=2013 |publisher=MIT Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Daniel Hutto]]: "Enactivists are concerned to defend the view that our most elementary ways of engaging with the world and others - including our basic forms of perception and perceptual experience - are mindful in the sense of being phenomenally charged and intentionally directed, despite being non-representational and content-free."&lt;ref name="Hutto2"&gt;
{{cite book |title= Radicalizing Enactivism: Minds without content |author1=Daniel D Hutto |author2=Erik Myin |pages=12–13  |chapter=Chapter 1: Enactivism: The radical line |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAj-96LlBuMC&amp;pg=PA12 |isbn= 9780262018548 |year=2013 |publisher=MIT Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Hutto calls this position 'REC' (&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;adical &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;nactive &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ognition): "According to REC, there is no way to distinguish neural activity that is imagined to be genuinely content involving (and thus truly mental, truly cognitive) from other non-neural activity that merely plays a supporting or enabling role in making mind and cognition possible."&lt;ref name="Hutto2" /&gt;

===Participatory sense-making===

[[Hanne De Jaegher]] and [[Ezequiel Di Paolo]] (2007)&lt;ref name="DeJaeger0"/&gt; have extended the enactive concept of sense-making&lt;ref name="EThompson3"/&gt; into the social domain. The idea takes as its departure point the process of interaction between individuals in a social encounter.&lt;ref name=DeJaegher_etal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hanne De Jaegher |author2=Ezequiel Di Paolo |author3=Shaun Gallagher |title= Can social interaction constitute social cognition? |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2010  |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=441–447 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.06.009 |pmid=20674467}}
&lt;/ref&gt; De Jaegher and Di Paolo argue that the interaction process itself can take on a form of autonomy (operationally defined). This allows them to define social cognition as the generation of meaning and its transformation through interacting individuals.

The notion of participatory sense-making has led to the proposal that interaction processes can sometimes play constitutive roles in social cognition (De Jaegher, Di Paolo, Gallagher, 2010).&lt;ref name="DeJaegher1"/&gt; It has been applied to research in [[social neuroscience]]''&lt;ref name="DiPaolo3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SchilbachTimmermans&gt;
{{cite journal |author1=Leonhard Schilbach |author2=Bert Timmermans |author3=Vasudevi Reddy |author4=Alan Costall |author5=Gary Bente |author6=Tobias Schlicht |author7=Kai Vogeley |title= Toward a second-person neuroscience |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |year=2013  |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=393–414 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X12000660}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' and [[autism]].''&lt;ref name="DeJaegher_autism"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hanne De Jaegher |title= Embodiment and sense-making in autism|journal=Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience |year=2012  |volume=7 |pages=15 |doi=10.3389/fnint.2013.00015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;''

In a similar vein, "an inter-enactive approach to agency holds that the behavior of agents in a social situation unfolds not only according to their individual abilities and goals, but also according to the conditions and constraints imposed by the autonomous dynamics of the interaction process itself".&lt;ref name=STorrance&gt;
{{cite journal |title=An Inter-Enactive Approach to Agency: Participatory Sense-Making, Dynamics, and Sociality |author1=Steve Torrance |author2=Tom Froese |url=http://sacral.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pdf/froese_humana_2011.pdf |journal=Human Mente |volume=15 |pages=21–53 |year=2011 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Torrance, enactivism involves five interlocking themes related to the question "What is it to be a (cognizing, conscious) agent?" It is:&lt;ref name=STorrance/&gt;
:1. to be a biologically autonomous ([[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]]) organism
:2. to generate ''significance'' or ''meaning'', rather than to act via...updated internal representations of the external world
:3. to engage in sense-making via dynamic coupling with the environment
:4. to 'enact' or 'bring forth' a world of significances by mutual co-determination of the organism with its enacted world
:5. to arrive at an experiential awareness via lived embodiment in the world.

Torrance adds that "many kinds of agency, in particular the agency of human beings, cannot be understood separately from understanding the nature of the interaction that occurs between agents." That view introduces the social applications of enactivism. "Social cognition is regarded as the result of a special form of action, namely ''social interaction''...the enactive approach looks at the circular dynamic within a dyad of embodied agents."&lt;ref name=FuchsT&gt;

Sattel |editor3=Peter Henningsen }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In [[cultural psychology]], enactivism is seen as a way to uncover cultural influences upon feeling, thinking and acting.&lt;ref name=Verheggen&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 8: Enactivism |author1=Cor Baerveldt |author2=Theo Verheggen |title=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WljI1r2e-SUC&amp;pg=PA165 |pages=165''ff'' |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396430.013.0009 |isbn=9780195396430 |date=May 2012 |quote= Whereas the enactive approach in general has focused on sense-making as an embodied and situated activity, enactive cultural psychology emphasizes the expressive and dynamically enacted nature of cultural meaning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baerveldt and Verheggen argue that "It appears that seemingly natural experience is thoroughly intertwined with sociocultural realities." They suggest that the social patterning of experience is to be understood through enactivism, "the idea that the reality we have in common, and in which we find ourselves, is neither a world that exists independently from us, nor a socially shared way of representing such a pregiven world, but a world itself brought forth by our ways of communicating and our joint action....The world we inhabit is manufactured of 'meaning' rather than 'information'.&lt;ref name=Baerveldt&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; "A core concept of social systems theory is derived from biological systems theory: the concept of ''autopoiesis''. Chilean biologist Humberto Maturana come up with the concept to explain how biological systems such as cells are a product of their own production." "Systems exist by way of operational closure and this means that they each construct themselves and their own realities."&lt;ref name=Moeller&gt;

:"Any domain of knowledge (or any problem within that domain of knowledge) can be represented in three ways: by a set of actions appropriate for achieving a certain result (enactive representation); by a set of summary images or graphics that stand for a concept without defining it fully  (iconic representation); and by a set of symbolic or logical propositions drawn from a symbolic system that is governed by rules or laws for forming and transforming propositions (symbolic representation)"

&lt;/ref&gt; In a cultural context, Vygotsky suggested that the kind of cognition that can take place is not dictated by the engagement of the isolated child, but is also a function of social interaction and dialogue that is contingent upon a sociohistorical context.&lt;ref name=Kincheloe&gt;

==Artificial intelligence aspects==
{{importance section|date=May 2014}}
{{main|Enactive interfaces}}
The ideas of enactivism regarding how organisms engage with their environment have interested those involved in [[Cognitive robotics|robotics]] and [[Human–computer interaction|man-machine interfaces]]. The analogy is drawn that a robot can be designed to interact and learn from its environment in a manner similar to the way an organism does that,&lt;ref name=Sandini&gt;
{{cite book |chapter=The ''iCub'' cognitive humanoid robot: An open-system research platform for enactive cognition |author1=Giulio Sandini |author2=Giorgio Metta |author3=David Vernon |title=50 Years of Artificial Intelligence: Essays Dedicated to the 50th Anniversary of Artificial Intelligence |editor1=Max Lungarella |editor2=Fumiya Iida |editor3=Josh Bongard |editor4=Rolf Pfeifer |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |isbn= 9783540772958}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and a human can interact with a computer-aided design tool or data base using an interface that creates an enactive environment for the user, that is, all the user's tactile, auditory, and visual capabilities are enlisted in a mutually explorative engagement, capitalizing upon all the user's abilities, and not at all limited to cerebral engagement.&lt;ref name=Bordegoni&gt;
{{cite book |title=Emotional Engineering: Service Development |chapter=§4.5.2 Design tools based upon enactive interfaces |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ow-UFDj15rUC&amp;pg=PA78 |pages=78 ''ff'' |isbn=9781849964234 |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |author=Monica Bordegoni |editor=Shuichi Fukuda}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In these areas it is common to refer to [[affordance]]s as a design concept, the idea that an environment or an interface affords opportunities for enaction, and good design involves optimizing the role of such affordances.&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Design of Everyday Things |edition=Revised and expanded |quote=An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVQPAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17 |year=2013 |page=11 |isbn=978-0465050659 |publisher=Basic Books |author=Don Norman |chapter=Affordances }}

&lt;/ref&gt; McGann, De Jaegher, and Di Paolo discuss how this work makes the dynamics of coupling between an agent and its environment, the foundation of enactivism, "an operational, empirically observable phenomenon."&lt;ref name=McGann3&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marek McGann |author2=Hanne De Jaegher |author3=Ezequiel Di Paolo |year= 2013 |title=Enaction and psychology |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=203–209 |url= https://www.academia.edu/4993021/Enaction_and_Psychology |doi= 10.1037/a0032935 |quote=Such modeling techniques allow us to explore the parameter space of coupling between agent and environment...to the point that their basic principles (the universals, if such there are, of enactive psychology) can be brought clearly into view.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the AI environment invents examples of enactivism using concrete examples that, although not as complex as living organisms, isolate and illuminate basic principles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26041">{{essay-like|date=February 2018}}The '''feminine beauty ideal''' is "the socially constructed notion that physical attractiveness is one of women's most important assets, and something all women should strive to achieve and maintain".&lt;ref&gt;Spade, J. Z., &amp; Valentine, C. G. (2008). The kaleidoscope of gender: Prisms, patterns, and possibilities. Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminine beauty ideals are rooted in [[heteronormative]] beliefs, and heavily influence women of all [[sexual orientations]]. The feminine beauty ideal, which also includes [[female body shape]], varies from culture to culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Voices Feminist Visions|last=Shaw and Lee|first=Susan and Janet|publisher=Mcgraw-Hill Education|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure to conform to a certain definition of "beautiful" can have drastic psychological effects. These ideals have been correlated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[eating disorder]]s, and low [[self-esteem]], starting from an [[adolescent]] age and continuing into adulthood.

==In fairy tales==
The feminine beauty ideal is portrayed in many children's [[fairy tale]]s.&lt;ref name="spade" /&gt; It has been common in the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tales for physical attractiveness in female characters to be rewarded.&lt;ref name="bakersperry"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker-Sperry | first1 = L. | last2 = Grauerholz | first2 = L. | year = 2003 | title = The pervasiveness and persistence of the feminine beauty ideal in children's fairy tales | url = | journal = Gender &amp; Society | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 711–726 | doi=10.1177/0891243203255605}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those fairy tales, "beauty is often associated with being white, economically privileged, and virtuous."&lt;ref name="bakersperry" /&gt;

The [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tales usually involve a beautiful heroine. In the story ''[[Snow White]]'', the protagonist Snow White is described as being "white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony wood" and "as beautiful as the light of day."&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, J. &amp; Grimm, W. (1857). Snow White. Berlin: Children's and Household Tales.&lt;/ref&gt; This fairy tale is defining beauty as being [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] with rosy cheeks and black hair. On the other hand, the [[antagonist]] of Brothers Grimm fairy tales is frequently described as ugly, relating beauty with goodness and ugliness with evil.&lt;ref name="bakersperry" /&gt; Ultimately, this correlation puts an emphasis on the virtue of being beautiful, as defined by fairy tales.

Starting almost 100 years after the Grimm Brothers wrote their fairy tales, the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] adapted these tales into animated feature films. About 40 percent of [[List of Walt Disney Pictures films|Disney films]] made from 1937-2000 had "only dominant cultural themes portrayed."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Towbin | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Haddock | first2 = S.A. | last3 = Zimmerman | first3 = T.S. | last4 = Lund | first4 = L.K. | last5 = Tanner | first5 = L.R. | year = 2004 | title = Images of gender, race, age, and sexual orientation in Disney feature-length animated films | url = | journal = Journal of Feminist Family Therapy | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 19–44 | doi=10.1300/j086v15n04_02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the majority of characters are white, "the expectation [is] that all people are or should be like this."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other common traits of female Disney characters are thin bodies with impossible bodily proportions, long, flowing hair, and large round eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unrealistic anatomies of Disney princesses revealed|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/unrealistic-anatomies-disney-princesses-revealed-article-1.1365387|website = NY Daily News|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constant emphasis on female beauty and what constitutes as being beautiful contributes to the overall feminine beauty ideal.

==In mass media==
[[Mass media]] is one of the most powerful tools for young girls and women to learn and also understand feminine beauty ideals. As mass media develops, the way people see feminine beauty ideals changes, as does how females view themselves. "The average teen girl gets about 180 minutes of media exposure daily and only about 10 minutes of parental interaction a day," says Renee Hobbs, EdD, associate professor of communications at Temple University.&lt;ref&gt;Heubeck, Girls and Body Image: Media's Effect, How Parents Can Help. WebMD. Retrieved October 26, 2013, from http://www.webmd.com/beauty/style/helping-girls-with-body-image&lt;/ref&gt; In most advertisements, female models are typically homogeneous in appearance. "Girls today are swamped by [ultra-thin] ideals not only in the form of dolls but also in comics, cartoons, TV, and advertising along with all the associated merchandising."&lt;ref name="Dittmar"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.42.2.283| title = Does Barbie make girls want to be thin?

Images of women can be virtually manipulated creating an ideal that is not only rare but also nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Networked bodies and extended corporealities: Theorizing the relationship between the body, embodiment, and contemporary new media.|last = White|first = Michele|date = 2009|journal = Feminist Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Encyclopedia of Gender in the Media'' states that "the postproduction techniques of airbrushing and computer-generated modifications 'perfect' the beauty myth by removing any remaining blemishes or imperfections visible to the eye."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Gender in Media|last = Kosut|first = Mary|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc. 2012|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Thousand Oaks, Calif :|pages = 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertisements for products "such as diets, cosmetics, and exercise gear [help] the media construct a dream world of hopes and high standards that incorporates the glorification of slenderness and weight loss."&lt;ref name="Groesz"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/eat.10005| title = The effect of experimental presentation of thin media images on body satisfaction: A meta-analytic review| journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders| volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 1–16| year = 2002| last1 = Groesz | first1 = L.

With a focus on an ideal physical appearance, the feminine beauty ideal distracts from female competency by prioritizing and valuing superficial characteristics related to beauty and appearance. When physical beauty is idealized and featured in the media, it reduces women to sexualized objects.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oppressive Beliefs at Play: Associations Among Beauty Ideals and Practices and Individual Differences in Sexism, Objectification of Others, and Media Exposure|journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly|date = 2010-09-01|issn = 1471-6402|pages = 365–379|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.2010.01582.x|first = Viren|last = Swami|first2 = Rebecca|last2 = Coles|first3 = Emma|last3 = Wilson|first4 = Natalie|last4 = Salem|first5 = Karolina|last5 = Wyrozumska|first6 = Adrian|last6 = Furnham}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates the message across mass media that one's body is inadequate apart from sex appeal and connects concepts of beauty and sex.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Perfection is achieved by celebrities through photoshopped images that hide every blemish or flaw while also editing body parts to create the "ideal" hourglass body type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://girlsempowermentnetwork.org/blog/media-today-unattainable-beauty-standards/|title=Media Today: Unattainable Beauty Standards|last1=Davis|first1=Cameron|website=Girls Empowerment Network|publisher=GENautsin|accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Dove Beauty and Confidence Report'' interviewed 10,500 females across thirteen countries and found that women's confidence in their body image is steadily declining - regardless of age or geographic location. Despite these findings, there is a strong desire to fight existing beauty ideals. In fact, 71% of women and 67% of girls want the media to do a better job of portraying different types of women. Studies done by [https://www.dove.com/us/en/home.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw_ODWBRCTARIsAE2_EvXfV2z63MzYDd9MrsO8AxoJM9mClWpDH2KOzUlazhewmQVCyh8Y7cUaAnPBEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds Dove] reveal low self esteem impacts women and girls' ability to release their true potential. 85% of women and 79% of girls admit they opt out of important life activities when they do not feel confident in the way they look. More than half of women (69%) and girls (65%) allude to pressure from the media and advertisements to become the world's version of beautiful, which is a driving force of appearance anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-dove-research-finds-beauty-pressures-up-and-women-and-girls-calling-for-change-583743391.html|title=New Dove Research Finds Beauty Pressures Up, and Women and Girls Calling for Change|website=CISION PR Newswire|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done by Dove have also revealed the following statistics: "4% of women consider themselves beautiful, 11% of girls globally are comfortable with describing themselves as beautiful, 72% of girls feel pressure to be beautiful, 80% of women agree that every woman has something about her that is beautiful, but do not see their own beauty, and that 54% of women agree that when it comes to how they look, they are their own worst beauty critic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dove.com/us/en/stories/about-dove/our-research.html|title=Our Research|website=Dove|publisher=Dove|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online space such as [[Instagram]] that is based on interactions through pictures creates a focus on one’s physical appearance.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiggemann|first=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|date=2016-03-31|title=‘Strong is the new skinny’: A content analysis of #fitspiration images on Instagram|url=https://doi-org.echo.louisville.edu/10.1177/1359105316639436|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=23|issue=8|pages=1003–1011|doi=10.1177/1359105316639436|issn=1359-1053}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to evidence gathered from a study focusing on general Instagram use in young women, researchers suggest Instagram usage was positively correlated with women’s [[self-objectification]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This same study also considered the effect of Instagram on the internalization of the Western beauty ideal for women, and the evidence gathered in the study agrees with the idea that Instagram use encourages women to internalize the societal beauty ideal of Western culture. Because users have the opportunity to shape and edit their photographs before sharing them, they can force them to adhere to the beauty ideal.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Viewing these carefully selected pictures shows the extent to which women internalize the Western beauty ideal.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In addition to researching the effects of general Instagram use, the study also researched the effects of "fitspiration" Instagram pages on young women's body image. “Fitspiration” pages aim to motivate the viewer through images of healthy eating and exercising.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Although these pages aim to be a positive way to promote a healthy lifestyle, they are also appearance-based and contain images of toned and skinny women.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fardouly|first=Jasmine|last2=Willburger|first2=Brydie K|last3=Vartanian|first3=Lenny R|date=February 2017|title=Instagram use and young women’s body image concerns and self-objectification: Testing mediational pathways|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F1461444817694499|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=1380–1395|doi=10.1177/1461444817694499|issn=1461-4448|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, there is a positive correlation to young women’s viewing "fitspiration" pages and a negative body image.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

A case study conducted about Instagram use and the Western feminine beauty ideal focused on the specific account @effyourbeautystandards, a body-positive Instagram page created by feminist plus-size model Tessa Holliday.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldeira|first=Sofia P.|last2=De Ridder|first2=Sander|date=2017-10-01|title=Representing diverse femininities on Instagram: A case study of the body-positive @effyourbeautystandards Instagram account|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/cjcs/2017/00000009/00000002/art00010;jsessionid=3d1f41r4fgcp.x-ic-live-01|journal=Catalan Journal of Communication &amp; Cultural Studies|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=321–337|doi=10.1386/cjcs.9.2.321_1|issn=1757-1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her page, Holliday instructed women to share pictures of themselves on Instagram with the hashtag #effyourbeautystandards.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Images posted with this hashtag would be selected by the account administrators and posted to the @effyourbeauutystandards page.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The evidence gathered in this case study suggested that while these selected pictures attempt to take an intersectional approach to the content women view on social media, they may still have an effect on how women view their bodies.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==Psychological effects==
Feminine beauty ideals have shown correlations to many psychological disorders, including lowered self-esteem and eating disorders. Western cultural standards of beauty and attractiveness promote unhealthy and unattainable body ideals that motivate women to seek perfection.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Since 1972, there has been a dramatic increase in the percentage of women in the United States who experience dissatisfaction with their bodies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balcetis | first1 = E. | last2 = Cole | first2 = S. | last3 = Chelberg | first3 = M.

M., Curran, D. J., &amp; Maier, S. L. (2012). Women, men, and society (6th ed.). Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been consistently found that perceived appearance is the single strongest predictor of global self-esteem among young adults.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Awareness of the ideal female shape is linked to increasingly negative self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through peer interaction and an environment of continual comparison to those portrayed in the media, women are often made to feel inadequate, and thus their self-esteem can decrease from their negative self-image. A negative body image can result in adverse psychosocial consequences, including depression, poor self-esteem, and diminished quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cash | first1 = T.

There is significant pressure for girls to conform to feminine beauty ideals, and, since thinness is prized as feminine, many women feel dissatisfied with their body shape. Body dissatisfaction has been found to be a precursor to serious psychological problems such as depression, social anxiety, and eating disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jefferson | first1 = D.

E. | year = 2009 | title = Appearance self-attitudes of African American and European American women: Media comparisons and internalization of beauty ideals | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 396–409 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2009.01517.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminine beauty ideal has influenced women, particularly younger women, to partake in extreme measures. Some of these extreme measures include  limiting their food intake, and participating in excessive physical activity to try to achieve what is considered the "ideal beauty standards". One aspect of the feminine beauty ideal includes having a thin waist, which is causing women to participate in these alarming behaviors. When trying to achieve these impossible standards, these dangerous practices are put into place.

== Across cultures ==
There have been many ideas over time and across different cultures of what the feminine beauty "ideal" is for a woman's body image. How well a woman follows these beauty ideals can also influence her social status within her culture. Physically altering the body has been a custom in many areas of the world for a long time. For example, decorating the body with tattoos is a symbol of attractiveness and status in the Japanese culture. The art of irezumi, or covering a woman's back with tattoos, is still practiced today in Japan. In Burma, Padung girls from the age of about five years, have metal rings put around their necks. Additional rings are added to the girl's neck every two years. This practice is done to produce a giraffe like effect in women. This practice is dying out, but these women would eventually carry up to 24 rings around their necks. A neck with many rings was considered the "ideal" image of physical beauty in this culture. In Europe, the corset has been used over time to create a tiny waistline. In Europe, a tiny waistline was considered "ideal" for beauty. A practice in China involved a girl's feet being bound at age six to create the "ideal" image of feet. The girl's feet were bound to become 1/3 the original size, which crippled the woman, but also gave her a very high social status and was much admired. After the revolution of 1911, this practice of foot binding was ended. The idea of what is considered the "ideal" of beauty for women varies across different cultural ideals and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=mo3shY_azw0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=evolution+of+the+feminine+beauty+ideal&amp;ots=Xt0gf13znd&amp;sig=mSwxpu4P7OktF5y8op7IC2mA1cE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title="The Feminine Ideal"|last=Thesander|first=Marianne|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd|year=1997|isbn=1861890044|location=London|pages=20–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been multiple "ideals for women" in France as well as other various cultures. A more common ideal is for females to have the "three white things". These "things" or traits refer to skin, teeth, and hands. There are also the "three black things" including the color of the person's eyebrows and eyelashes. This leaves three other areas to embark on color including the cheeks, lips, and nails.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, L. l. (2016). GOLD, CRIMSON AND IVORY: THE IDEAL FEMALE BEAUTY AND ITS MATERIAL CULTURE IN 16TH CENTURY ITALY AND FRANCE. Acta Academiae Artium Vilnensis, (80/81), 35-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary perspectives==

Ideas of feminine beauty may have originated from features that correlate with fertility and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11199-011-9938-z|title=Shape and Significance of Feminine Beauty: An Evolutionary Perspective|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|issue=9–10|pages=723–731|year=2011|last1=Singh|first1=Devendra|last2=Singh|first2=Dorian}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features include a figure where there is more fat distribution in the hip and thigh area, and vary between different cultures. Within Western cultures, having a smaller waist and bigger hips has a large influence. This differs in Eastern cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2093974|year=2007|author1=Singh|first1=D|title=Did the perils of abdominal obesity affect depiction of feminine beauty in the sixteenth to eighteenth century British literature?

{{Buddhism}}
The '''Four Noble Truths''' refer to and express the basic orientation of [[Buddhism]]{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=59}} in a short expression:{{sfn|Norman|2003}}{{refn|group=note|name="Moksha"}} we [[Taṇhā|crave]] and [[Upādāna|cling]] to [[Saṅkhāra#Conditioned things|impermanent states and things]],{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}} which are ''[[dukkha]]'',{{sfn|Khantipalo|2003|p=41}} "incapable of satisfying"&lt;ref group=web name="Sumedho-first"/&gt; and painful.&lt;ref group=web name="Sumedho-first" /&gt;{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}}{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=74-75}}{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=147}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-DL Four Truths" /&gt; This craving keeps us caught in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]'',{{refn|group=note|name="Samudaya"}} the endless cycle of repeated ''[[bhava]]'' ("becoming") and ''[[Jāti (Buddhism)|jāti]]'' (literally: "birth", interpreted as [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]), and the continued ''dukkha'' that comes with it.{{refn|group=note|name="Samsara"}} There is, however, a way to [[Moksha|end this cycle]],{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=45-46}}{{refn|group=note|name="Pleasure"}} namely by attaining ''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]]'', cessation of craving, whereafter birth and the accompanying ''dukkha'' will no longer arise again.{{refn|group=note|name="Nirodha"}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|p=304}} This can be accomplished by following the [[Noble Eightfold Path|eightfold path]],{{refn|group=note|name="Moksha"}} restraining oneself, cultivating discipline and wholesome states, and practicing [[mindfulness]] and ''[[Dhyana in Buddhism|dhyana]]''.{{sfn|Raju|1985|p=147–151}}{{sfn|Eliot|2014|p=39–41}}

In short form, the four truths are ''dukkha'', ''samudaya'' ("arising," "coming together"), ''nirodha'' ("cessation," "confinement"), and ''marga'', the path leading to cessation.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=219, 222}} As the "Four Noble Truths" ([[Sanskrit]]: ''catvāri āryasatyāni''; [[Pali]]: ''cattāri ariyasaccāni''), they are "the truths of the [[Arhat|Noble Ones]],"{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} the truths or realities which are understood by the "worthy ones"&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Arhat"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34073/arhat Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Arhat (Buddhism)'']&lt;/ref&gt; who have attained nirvana.{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=67}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Arhat" /&gt;

In the ''[[Buddhist texts|sutras]]'', Buddhist religious texts, the four truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=223-231}} They represent the awakening and liberation of the Buddha, but also the possibility of liberation for all sentient beings, describing how release from craving is to be reached.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=56}} In the [[Pali canon]] scriptures, the four truths appear in a "network of teachings,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} as part of "the entire ''[[Dharma#Buddhism|dhamma]]'' matrix,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86}} which have to be taken together.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} They provide a conceptual framework for introducing and explaining Buddhist thought, which has to be personally understood or "experienced".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} {{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=27-28}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-DL Four Truths"/&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gethin_framework"}}

The function of the four truths, and their importance, developed over time, when ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]'', or "liberating insight," came to be regarded as liberating in itself,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} instead of or in addition to the practice of ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'', meditation.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}} This "liberating insight" gained a prominent place in the sutras, and the four truths came to represent this liberating insight, as part of the enlightenment story of the Buddha.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}}

The four truths became of central importance in the [[Theravada]] tradition of Buddhism,{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55-56}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}} which holds to the idea that insight into the four truths is liberating in itself.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}} They are less prominent in the [[Mahayana]] tradition, which sees the higher aims of insight into ''[[sunyata]]'', emptiness, and following the [[Bodhisattva path]] as central elements in their teachings and practice.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179-3180}} The Mahayana tradition reinterpreted the four truths to explain how a liberated being can still be "pervasively operative in this world."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346-347}} Beginning with the exploration of Buddhism by [[Colonial India|western colonialists]] in the 19th century and the development of [[Buddhist modernism]], they came to be often presented in the west as the central teaching of Buddhism.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=72-73}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196}}

==The four truths==

===Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta===
The four truths are best known from their presentation in the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' text,{{refn|group=note|name="best-known"}} which contains two sets of the four truths,{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=295}}{{sfn|Norman|2003}} while various other sets can be found in the [[Pali Canon]], a collection of scriptures in the [[Theravadan]] Buddhist tradition.{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} According to the Buddhist tradition, the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', "Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion,"&lt;ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion - Majjhima Nikaya 56.11'']&lt;/ref&gt; contains the first teachings that the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] gave after attaining [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|full awakening]], and liberation from rebirth. According to [[L. S. Cousins]], many scholars are of the view that "this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date,"{{sfn|Cousins|2002|p=3}} and according to professor of religion Carol S. Anderson{{refn|group=note|Professor of religion, Kalamazoo College; Co-Editor of the Journal of Buddhist-Christian Studies.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://www.society-buddhist-christian-studies.org/partners/ ''Governing Board of the Society for Buddhist-Christian studies'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://www.society-buddhist-christian-studies.org/carol-anderson ''Carol Anderson'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} the four truths may originally not have been part of this sutta, but were later added in some versions.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=68}} Within this discourse, the four noble truths are given as follows ("bhikkus" is normally translated as "Buddhist monks"):
{{quote| Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the [[Skandha|five aggregates]] subject to clinging are suffering.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving [''[[taṇhā]]'', "thirst"] which [[Twelve Nidānas|leads to re-becoming]], accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for becoming, craving for disbecoming.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it is this noble eightfold path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.&lt;ref group=web name="BB"&gt;[http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebsut001.htm Bikkhu Bodhi (translator), ''Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta. Samyutta Nikaya LVI, 11. "Setting in Motion the Wheel of the Dhamma."'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to this sutra, with the complete comprehension of these four truths release from ''samsara'', the cycle of rebirth, was attained:
{{quote|Knowledge &amp; vision arose in me: 'Unprovoked is my release. This is the last birth. There is now no further becoming.&lt;ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"/&gt;}}

The comprehension of these four truths by his audience leads to the opening of the ''Dhamma Eye'', that is, the attainment of right vision:
{{quote|Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation.&lt;ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"/&gt;}}

===Mnemonic set===
According to [[K. R. Norman]], the Pali canon contains various shortened forms of the four truths, the "mnemonic set," which were "intended to remind the hearer of the full form of the NTs."{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=213}} The earliest form of the mnemonic set was "dukkham samudayo nirodho magga," without the reference to the [[Pali]] terms ''sacca''{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=219}} or ''arya'',{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}} which were later added to the formula.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}} The four mnemonic terms can be translated as follows:
# ''[[Dukkha]]'' - "incapable of satisfying,"&lt;ref group=web name="Sumedho-first"&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble4.htm Ajahn Sumedho, ''The First Noble Truth'']&lt;/ref&gt; "the unsatisfactory nature and the general insecurity of all [[Saṅkhāra#Conditioned things|conditioned phenomena]]"; "painful."{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}}{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}} ''Dukkha'' is most commonly translated as "suffering". According to Khantipalo, this is an incorrect translation, since it refers to the ultimately unsatisfactory nature of temporary states and things, including pleasant but temporary experiences.{{sfn|Khantipalo|2003|p=46}} According to Emmanuel, ''Dukkha'' is the opposite of ''sukha'', "pleasure," and it is better translated as "pain."{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}}
# ''[[Samudaya]]'' - "origin", "source", "arising", "coming to existence";&lt;ref group=web name=DigitalLibrary&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120611220213/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/DBLM/olcourse/sanskrit/heart/heart16.htm Digital Library &amp; Museum of Buddhist Studies, College of liberal Arts, Taiwan University: Samudaya]&lt;/ref&gt; "aggregate of the constituent elements or factors of any being or existence", "cluster", "coming together", "combination", "producing cause", "combination", "rising."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+samudaya&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for spoken Sanskrit, ''samudaya'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Full set===
This full set, which is most commonly used in modern expositions,{{refn|group=note|name="best-known"|For example:&lt;br&gt;
* Ven. Dr. Rewata Dhamma: The Four Noble Truths [...] are: 1. The Noble Truth of Suffering (''dukkha''); 2. The Noble Truth of the origin of suffering (''samudaya''); 3. The Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering (''nirodha''); 4. The Noble Truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering (''magga'').{{sfn|Dhamma|1997|p=55}}
* Bhikkhu Bodhi: "The Four Noble Truths are as follows: 1. The truth of Dukkha; 2. The truth of the origin of Dukkha; 3. The truth of the cessation of Dukkha; 4. The truth of the path, the way to liberation from Dukkha".&lt;ref group=web name=bodhi1/&gt;
* Geshe Tashi Tsering: "The four noble truths are: 1. The noble truth of suffering; 2. The noble truth of the origin of suffering; 3. The noble truth of the cessation of suffering and the origin of suffering; 4. The noble truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering and the origin of suffering."{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 246-250}}
* Joseph Goldstein: "The four noble truths are the truth of suffering, its cause, its end, and the path to that end.{{sfn|Goldstein|2002|p=24}}}} contains grammatical errors, pointing to multiple sources for this set and translation problems within the ancient Buddhist community. Nevertheless, they were considered correct by the Pali tradition, which didn't correct them.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}} According to K.R. Norman, the basic set is as follows:{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=219, 222}}
* idam dukkham, "this is pain"
* ayam dukkha-samudayo, "this is the origin of pain"
* ayam dukkha-nirodha, "this is the cessation of pain"
* ayam dukkha-nirodha-gamini patipada, "this is the path leading to the cessation of pain."  The key terms in the longer version of this expression, ''dukkha-nirodha-gamini Patipada'', can be translated as follows:
:* ''Gamini'': leading to, making for&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=pali&amp;query=g%C4%81min%C4%AB&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 Pali Text Society Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* ''Patipada'': road, path, way; the means of reaching a goal or destination&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#pq Access to Insight Glossary - pq]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative formulations===
According to L.S. Cousins, the four truths are not restricted to the well-known form where ''dukkha'' is the subject. Other forms take "the world, the arising of the world" or "the [[Asava|āsavas]], the arising of the āsavas" as their subject. According to Cousins, "the well-known form is simply shorthand for all of the forms."{{sfn|Cousins|2001|p=36}} "The world" refers to the [[saṅkhāra]]s, that is, all compounded things,&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/7.2-Rohitassa-S-s2.26-piya.pdf The Dharmafarers, ''Rhitassa Sutra'' (Samyutta Nikaya 2.26)]&lt;/ref&gt; or to the [[Ayatana|six sense spheres]].{{sfn|Choong|2000|p=84}}

The various terms all point to the same basic idea of Buddhism, as described in [[Skandha|five skandhas]] and [[Twelve Nidānas|twelve nidānas]]: sense-contact with objects leads to sensation, perception, [[Saṅkhāra]] ('inclinations', c.q. craving etc.), and consciousness. The ''Twelve Nidānas'' describe how this also leads to rebirth: from sensation comes craving, from craving comes karma, from karma comes rebirth. The aim of the Buddhist path is to reverse this causal chain: when there is no (response to) sensation, there is no craving, no karma, no rebirth.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=840}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=55-59}}

===Truths for the noble ones===
The Pali terms ''ariya sacca'' (Sanskrit: ''arya satya'') are commonly translated as "noble truths". This translation is a convention started by the earliest translators of Buddhist texts into English. According to K.R. Norman, this is just one of several possible translations.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} According to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]],{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}
{{quote|[T]here is no particular reason why the Pali expression ariyasaccani should be translated as 'noble truths'. It could equally be translated as 'the nobles' truths', or 'the truths for nobles', or 'the nobilising truths', or 'the truths of, possessed by, the noble ones' [...] In fact the Pali expression (and its Sanskrit equivalent) can mean all of these, although the Pali commentators place 'the noble truths' as the least important in their understanding.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}}}

The term "arya" was later added to the four truths.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}}{{sfn|Analayo|2013|p=15}} The term ''[[Arya (Buddhism)|ariya]]'' (Sanskrit: ''arya'') can be translated as "noble", "not ordinary", "valuable", "precious".{{refn|group=note|Ajahn Sucitto states: "So the four truths (ariya sacca) are generally called “noble” truths, although one might also translate ariya as “precious.” "{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|loc=Kindle Location 122}} }} "pure",{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Paul Williams:
{{quote|The Aryas are the noble ones, the saints, those who have attained 'the fruits of the path', 'that middle path the Tathagata has comprehended which promotes sight and knowledge, and which tends to peace, higher wisdom, enlightenment, and Nibbana'.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=52}}}}

The term ''[[satya|sacca]]'' (Sanskrit: ''[[satya]]'') is a central term in Indian thought and religion. It is typically translated as "truth"; but it also means "that which is in accord with reality", or "reality". According to [[Rupert Gethin]], the four truths are "four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}} They function as "a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gethin_framework"|Gethin: "The word satya (Pali sacca) can certainly mean truth, but it might equally be rendered as 'real' or 'actual thing'. That is, we are not dealing here with propositional truths with which we must either agree or disagree, but with four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening. [...] This is not to say that the Buddha's discourses do not contain theoretical statements of the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation, but these descriptions function not so much as dogmas of the Buddhist faith as a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}}} According to K.R. Norman, probably the best translation is "the truth[s] of the noble one (the Buddha)."{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} It is a statement of how things are seen by a Buddha, how things really are when seen correctly. It is the truthful way of seeing,{{refn|group=note|'"Truth", ''satya'' (Sanskrit), ''sacca'' (Pali), derived from ''sat'', being, how it is.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}}} Through not seeing things this way, and behaving accordingly, we suffer.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}{{refn|group=note|Contemporary Buddhist teacher [[Mingyur Rinpoche]] describes the four ''arya satya'' as "Four Pure Insights into the Way Things Are".{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Contemporary scholar Peter Harvey translates ''arya satya'' as "True Realities for the Spiritually Ennobled".{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=52}}}}

===Symbolic and propositional function===
[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Dharmacakra]], often used to represent the Noble Eightfold Path]]

According to Anderson, the four truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function:
{{quote|... the four noble truths are truly set apart within the body of the Buddha's teachings, not because they are by definition sacred, but because they are both a symbol and a doctrine and transformative within the sphere of right view. As one doctrine among others, the four noble truths make explicit the structure within which one should seek enlightenment; as a symbol, the four noble truths evoke the possibility of enlightenment. As both, they occupy not only a central but a singular position within the Theravada canon and tradition.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}}}}

As a symbol, they refer to the possibility of awakening, as represented by the Buddha, and are of utmost importance:
{{quote|[W]hen the four noble truths are regarded in the canon as the first teaching of the Buddha, they function as a view or doctrine that assumes a symbolic function. Where the four noble truths appear in the guise of a religious symbol in the ''Sutta-pitaka'' and the ''Vinaya-pitaka'' of the Pali canon, they represent the enlightenment experience of the Buddha and the possibility of enlightenment for all Buddhists within the cosmos.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55}}}}

As a proposition, they are part of the matrix or "network of teachings," in which they are "not particularly central,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} but have an equal place next to other teachings,{{sfn|Anderson|2011|p=127-128}} describing how release from craving is to be reached.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}} A long recognized feature of the Theravada canon is that it lacks an "overarching and comprehensive structure of the path to ''nibbana''."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=131}} The sutras form a network or matrix, and the four truths appear within this "network of teachings," which have to be taken together.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gethin_framework"}} Within this network, "the four noble truths are one doctrine among others and are not particularly central,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} but are a part of "the entire ''dhamma'' matrix."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86}} The four noble truths are be set and learnt in that network, learning "how the various teachings intersect with each other,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86-87}} and refer to the various Buddhist techniques, which are all explicitly and implicitly part of the passages which refer to the four truths.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=132}} According to Anderson,
{{quote|There is no single way of understanding the teachings: one teaching may be used to explain another in one passage; the relationship may be reversed or altered in other talks.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86}}}}

===''Dukkha'' and its ending===
As a proposition, the four truths defy an exact definition, but refer to and express the basic orientation of [[Buddhism]]:{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=59}} [[Upādāna|clinging and craving]] to temporary states and things is ultimately unsatisfactory and painful, ''dukkha'',{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=45-46}} and sustains ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]'', the repeated cycle of ''[[bhava]]'' (becoming, habitual tendencies) and ''[[Jāti (Buddhism)|jāti]]'' ("birth," interpreted as either [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], the coming to be of a new existence; or as the arising of the sense of self as a mental phenomenon).

To attain this state, all phenomena subject to birth – the [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|khandhas]] and [[Nidana|nidānas]] – must be transcended by means of [[Nekkhamma|non-attachment]].{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=71-72}}}}

The last sermon, the ''[[Maha-parinibbana Sutta]]'' (Last Days of the Buddha, Digha Nikaya 16)", states it as follows:
{{quote|[...] it is through not realizing, through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you [...] But now, bhikkhus, that these have been realized and penetrated, cut off is the craving for existence, destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming [rebirth], and there is no fresh becoming.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html ''Maha-parinibbana Sutta: Last Days of the Buddha'', translated by Sister Vajira &amp; Francis Story]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other interpretations===
According to Bhikkhu [[Buddhadasa]], "birth" does refer not to physical birth and death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the "emergence of the ego". According to Buddhadhasa,
{{quote|...dependent arising is a phenomenon that lasts an instant; it is impermanent. Therefore, Birth and Death must be explained as phenomena within the process of dependent arising in everyday life of ordinary people. Right Mindfulness is lost during contacts of the Roots and surroundings. Thereafter, when vexation due to greed, anger, and ignorance is experienced, the ego has already been born. It is considered as one 'birth'".&lt;ref&gt;Buddhadhasa, Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books6/Bhikkhu_Buddhadasa_Paticcasamuppada.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some contemporary teachers tend to explain the four truths psychologically, by taking ''dukkha'' to mean mental anguish in addition to the physical pain of life,{{sfn|Batchelor|2012|p=94}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2016|p=10}} and interpreting the four truths as a means to attain happiness in this life.{{sfn|Kingsland|2016|p=280}} In the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]] that emerged out of the Theravada Buddhism, freedom and the "pursuit of happiness" have become the main goals, not the end of rebirth, which is hardly mentioned in their teachings.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|pp=164-166}}{{refn|group=note|The Vipassana-movement originated in colonial Burma, in response to the British colonial regime. While traditional Theravada saw little room for meditation practice, a subordinate role for lay Buddhists, and the attainment of ''nirvana'' as impossible in our times, reformists advocated the practice of meditation by lay Buddhists, as a means to preserve the pre-colonial order, which centered around Buddhism. ''Nirvana'' was suddenly deemed attainable, also for lay Buddhists. The Burmese reformists had a profound influence in the Theravada world, and also in the USA since the 1970s, shaping the popular understanding of Buddhism.&lt;ref group=web name="Braun2014"&gt;Eric Braun (2014), [http://www.spiritrock.org/document.doc?id=5335 ''How colonialism sparked the global Vipassana movement'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also David Chapman (2011), [https://vividness.live/2011/07/07/theravada-reinvents-meditation/ ''Theravada reinvents meditation''].}}

Yet, though freedom and happiness is a part of the Buddhist teachings, these words refer to something different in traditional Asian Buddhism. According to Fronsdal, "when Asian teachers do talk about freedom, it is primarily in reference to what one is free from—that is, from greed, hate, delusion, grasping, attachment, wrong view, self, and most significantly, rebirth".{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=172}} ''Nibbana'' is the final freedom, and it has no purpose beyond itself. In contrast, freedom in the creative modern interpretation of Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path means living happily and wisely, "without drastic changes in lifestyle".{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=172}} Such freedom and happiness is not the goal of Four Noble Truths and related doctrines within traditional Buddhism, but the vipassana teachings in the West make no reference to traditional Theravada doctrines, instead they present only the pragmatic and experiential goals in the form of therapy for the audience's current lives.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|pp=172-174}} The creative interpretations are driven in part because the foundational premises of Buddhism do not make sense to audiences outside of Asia.{{refn|group=note|Stephen Batchelor states, "Such craving is at the root of greed, hatred, and bewilderment that prompt one to commit acts that cause one to be reborn after death in more or less favourable conditions in samsara. Although I have presented this formulation of the existential dilemma and its resolution in Buddhist terms, the same soteriological framework is shared by Hindus and Jains. (...) So embedded is this Indian soteriological framework in Buddhism that Buddhists might find it unintelligible that one would even consider questioning it. For to dispense with such key doctrines as rebirth, the law of kamma, and liberation from the cycle of birth and death would surely undermine the entire edifice of Buddhism itself. Yet for those who have grown up outside of Indian culture, who feel at home in a modernity informed by the natural sciences, to then be told that one cannot “really” practise the dharma unless one adheres to the tenets of ancient Indian soteriology makes little sense. The reason people can no longer accept these beliefs need not be because they reject them as false, but because such views are too much at variance with everything else they know and believe about the nature of themselves and the world. They simply do not work anymore, and the intellectual gymnastics one needs to perform to make them work seem casuistic and, for many, unpersuasive. They are metaphysical beliefs, in that (like belief in God) they can neither be convincingly demonstrated nor refuted."{{sfn|Batchelor|2012|p=89-90}}}}{{refn|group=note|name="Wallace"|B. Alan Wallace states, "The Theravada Buddhist worldview is originally based on the Pali Buddhist canon, as interpreted by the great fifth-century commentator Buddhaghosa and later Buddhist scholars and contemplatives. For the immigrant Theravada Buddhist laity, the central feature of this worldview is the affirmation of the reality of reincarnation and karma. The possibility of achieving nirvana is primarily a concern for Buddhist monastics, while the laity are more concerned with avoiding karma that would propel them to a miserable rebirth, and with accumulating meritorious karma that will lead to a favorable rebirth and, in the long run, to ultimate liberation. (...) As a direct result of their belief in the efficacy of karma, Theravada lay Buddhists commonly make offerings of food, goods, and money to the ordained Sangha. Such meritorious conduct is thought to lead to a better rebirth either for themselves or for their deceased loved ones, depending on how the merit is dedicated by the person who performs this service."{{sfn|Wallace|2002|p=36–37}}}} According to Spiro, "the Buddhist message is not simply a psychological message," but an eschatological message.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=42}}

{{See also|Pre-sectarian Buddhism}}

According to Anderson, "the four truths are recognized as perhaps the most important teaching of the Buddha."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55}} Yet, as early as 1935 [[Caroline Rhys Davids]] wrote that for a teaching so central to Theravada Buddhism, it was missing from critical passages in the Pali canon.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=ix}} According to Gethin, the four truths and the eightfold path are only two lists of "literally hundreds of similar lists covering the whole range of the theory and practice of ancient Buddhism."{{sfn|Gethin|2003|p=20}} The position of the four truths within the canon raises questions, and has been investigated throughout the 19th and 20th century.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=168-211}}

===Scholarly analysis of the oldest texts===
According to academic scholars, inconsistencies in the oldest texts may reveal developments in the oldest teachings.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=ix}}{{refn|group=note|name="development of teachings"}} While the Theravada-tradition holds that the Sutta Pitaka is "the definitive recension of the Buddha-word,"{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|1995a|p=13}} and Theravadins argue that it is likely that the sutras date back to the Buddha himself, in an unbroken chain of oral transmission,&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web | last1 =Payutto|first1=P.

Information of the oldest teachings of Buddhism, such as on the Four Noble Truths, has been obtained by analysis of the oldest texts and these inconsistencies, and are a matter of ongoing discussion and research.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}{{refn|group=note|According to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished regarding the possibility to retain knowledge of the oldest Buddhism:{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=vii}}
# "Stress on the fundamental homogeneity and substantial authenticity of at least a considerable part of the Nikayic materials;"{{refn|group=subnote|Well-known proponents of the first position are:&lt;br&gt;* [[A.K. Warder]]. According to A.K. Warder, in his 1970 publication "Indian Buddhism", from the oldest extant texts a common kernel can be drawn out,{{sfn|Warder|1999|loc=inside flap}} namely the [[Bodhipakkhiyādhammā]]. According to Warder, c.q. his publisher: "This kernel of doctrine is presumably common Buddhism of the period before the great schisms of the fourth and third centuries BC. It may be substantially the Buddhism of the Buddha himself, although this cannot be proved: at any rate it is a Buddhism presupposed by the schools as existing about a hundred years after the parinirvana of the Buddha, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was formulated by anyone else than the Buddha and his immediate followers."{{sfn|Warder|1999|loc=inside flap}}&lt;br&gt;* [[Richard Gombrich]]: "I have the greatest difficulty in accepting that the main edifice is not the work of a single genius.

# "Scepticism with regard to the possibility of retrieving the doctrine of earliest Buddhism;"{{refn|group=subnote|A proponent of the second position is Ronald Davidson: "While most scholars agree that there was a rough body of sacred literature (disputed)(sic) that a relatively early community (disputed)(sic) maintained and transmitted, we have little confidence that much, if any, of surviving Buddhist scripture is actually the word of the historic Buddha."{{sfn|Davidson|2003|p=147}}}}
# "Cautious optimism in this respect."{{refn|group=subnote|Well-known proponent of the third position are:&lt;br&gt;* J.W. de Jong: "It would be hypocritical to assert that nothing can be said about the doctrine of earliest Buddhism [...] the basic ideas of Buddhism found in the canonical writings could very well have been proclaimed by him [the Buddha], transmitted and developed by his disciples and, finally, codified in fixed formulas."{{sfn|Jong|1993|p=25}}&lt;br&gt;* Johannes Bronkhorst: "This position is to be preferred to (ii) for purely methodological reasons: only those who seek may find, even if no success is guaranteed."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1997|p=vii}}&lt;br&gt;* Donald Lopez: "The original teachings of the historical Buddha are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to recover or reconstruct."{{sfn|Lopez|1995|p=4}}}}}}

===Development===

====Growing importance====
According to Bronkhorst, the four truths may already have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, but did not have the central place they acquired in later buddhism.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} According to Anderson, only by the time of the commentaries, in the fifth century CE, did the four truths come to be identified in the Theravada tradition as the central teaching of the Buddha.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55-56}}{{refn|group=note|Anderson: "However, the four noble truths do not always appear in stories of the Buddha's enlightenment where we might expect to find them. This feature may indicate that the four noble truths emerged into the canonical tradition at a particular point and slowly became recognized as the first teaching of the Buddha. Speculations about early and late teachings must be made relative to other passages in the Pali canon because of a lack of supporting extratextual evidence. Nonetheless, it is still possible to suggest a certain historical development of the four noble truths within the Pali canon. What we will find is a doctrine that came to be identified as the central teaching of the Buddha by the time of the commentaries in the fifth century C.E."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55-56}}}} According to Anderson,
{{quote|... the four noble truths were probably not part of the earliest strata of what came to be recognized as Buddhism, but that they emerged as a central teaching in a slightly later period that still preceded the final redactions of the various Buddhist canons.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=21}}}}

According to Feer and Anderson, the four truths probably entered the Sutta Pitaka from the Vinaya, the rules for monastic order.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=74, 77}}{{refn|group=note|Anderson refers to Léon Feer, who already in 1870 "suggested the possibility that the four noble truths emerged into Buddhist literature through ''vinaya'' collections."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=183}} She also refers to Bareau, who noticed the consistency between the two versions in the ''Mahavagga'', part of the ''Vinaya'', and the ''Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta'' of the Buddha's enlightenment: "As Bareau noted, the consistency between these two versions of the Buddha's enlightenment is an indication that the redactors of the Theravada canon probably brought the two accounts into agreement with each other at a relatively late point in the formation of the canon.&lt;br /&gt;Leon Feer had already suggested in 1870 that the versions of the four noble truths found in the sutras and suttas were derived from the vinaya rescensions in the larger body of Buddhist literature; Bareau's conclusion builds on this claim."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=74}}}} They were first added to enlightenment-stories which contain the Four Jhanas, replacing terms for "liberating insight".{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=148}}{{refn|group=note|According to Schmithausen, in his often-cited article ''On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of 'Liberating Insight' and 'Enlightenment' in Early Buddhism'', the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}}} From there they were added to the biographical stories of the Buddha.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=17}}{{refn|group=note|Anderson refers to research by K.R.

====Substituting "liberating insight"====
Scholars have noted inconsistencies in the presentations of the Buddha's enlightenment, and the Buddhist path to liberation, in the oldest sutras. They offer that these inconsistencies show that the Buddhist teachings evolved, either during the lifetime of the Buddha, or thereafter.&lt;!--**START OF NOTE**--&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="development of teachings"|See:

Instead, they are a rather late theory on the content of the Buddha's enlightenment.{{sfn|Hirakawa|1990|p=28}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, the earliest Buddhist path consisted of a set of practices which culminate in the practice of ''dhyana'',{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} leading to a calm of mind and [[Sati (Buddhism)|awareness]] (mindfulness){{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=XXV}} which according to Vetter ''is'' the liberation which is being sought.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{refn|group=note|Note that ''dhyana'' is not the same as ''samatha'', the calming of the mind by one-pointedly concentration. While ''dhyana'' also leads to a calm of mind, it aids in developing mindfulness, which is necessary to be aware of the arising of disturbing, selfish, thoughts and emotions, and to counter them. Wynne: "...the Buddha taught a ‘middle way’ between pure meditation and cognitive practices. The states of absorption induced by meditation were considered useful and necessary, but in distinction from the meditative mainstream their ultimate aim was insight. For the Buddha it was vitally important that the meditative adept should apply his concentrative state to the practice of mindfulness (Sn 1070: ''satima''; Sn 1111: ''ajjhattañ ca bahiddha ca nabhinandato''; Sn 1113: ''ajjhattañ ca bahiddha ca natthi ti passato''), and work towards the attainment of insight. According to this view meditation alone, the goal of the meditative mainstream would have been harshly criticized in the earliest Buddhism."{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=105}}}} Later on, "liberating insight" came to be regarded as equally liberating.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} This "liberating insight" came to be exemplified by ''prajna'', or the insight in the "four truths,"{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} but also by other elements of the Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chpter 7}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, this growing importance of "liberating insight" was a response to other religious groups in India, which held that a liberating insight was indispensable for ''[[moksha]]'', liberation from rebirth.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxii, xxxiii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}{{refn|group=note|Tillmann Vetter: "Very likely the cause was the growing influence of a non-Buddhist spiritual environment·which claimed that one can be released only by some truth or higher knowledge. In addition the alternative (and perhaps sometimes competing) method of discriminating insight (fully established after the introduction of the four noble truths) seemed to conform so well to this claim."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiii}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Bronkhorst, this happened under influence of the "mainstream of meditation," that is, Vedic-Brahmanical oriented groups, which believed that the cessation of action could not be liberating, since action can never be fully stopped. Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions. By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating. What exactly was regarded as the central insight "varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}}} This change is reflected in the canon, where, according to Bronkhorst,
{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}

According to Vetter and Bonkhorst, the ideas on what exactly constituted this "liberating insight" was not fixed but developed over time.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chpter 7}} According to Bronkhorst, in [[Presectarian Buddhism|earliest Buddhism]] the four truths did not serve as a description of "liberating insight".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Initially the term ''prajna'' served to denote this "liberating insight." Later on, ''prajna'' was replaced in the suttas by the "four truths."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} This happened in those texts where practicing the four jhanas preceded the attainment of "liberating insight," and where this practice of the four jhanas then culminates in "liberating insight."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}} This "liberating insight" came to be defined as "insight into the four truths," which is presented as the "liberating insight" which constituted the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], or "enlightenment" of the Buddha. When he understood these truths he was "enlightened" and liberated,{{refn|group=note|"Enlightenment" is a typical western term, which bears its own, specific western connotations, meanings and interpretations.{{sfn|Cohen|2006}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}}} as reflected in Majjhima Nikaya 26:42: "his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=268}}

Bronkhorst points to an inconsistency, noting that the four truths refer here to the eightfold path as the means to gain liberation, while the attainment of insight into the four truths is portrayed as liberating in itself.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} According to Bronkhorst, this is an inconsistency which reveals a change which took place over time in the composition of the sutras.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} An example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42-43, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=102-103}}

According to Schmithausen, the four truths were superseded by ''[[pratityasamutpada]]'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the [[Anatta|non-existence of a substantial self or person]].{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}}. Schmithausen further states that still other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon:
{{quote|"that the five Skandhas are impermanent, disagreeable, and neither the Self nor belonging to oneself";{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26}} "the contemplation of the arising and disappearance (''udayabbaya'') of the five Skandhas";{{refn|group=note|Anguttara Nikaya II.45 (PTS)}} "the realisation of the Skandhas as empty (''rittaka''), vain (''tucchaka'') and without any pith or substance (''asaraka'').{{refn|group=note|Samyutta Nikaya III.140-142 (PTS)}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}}}

In contrast, Thanissaro Bikkhu presents the view that the four truths, [[pratityasamutpada]] and anatta are inextricably intertwined &lt;ref&gt;Wings to Awakening Part 3, https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part3.html#part3-h-1&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Acquiring the ''dhamma-eye'' and destroying the ''āsavās''===
In their symbolic function, the sutras present the insight into the four truths as the culmination of the Buddh's path to awakening. In the ''Vinayapitaka'' and the ''Sutta-pitaka'' they have the same symbolic function, in a reenactment by his listeners of the Buddha's awakening by attaining the ''dhamma-eye''. In contrast, here this insight serves as the starting point to path-entry for his audience.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=126, 132, 143}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2000|p=79, 80}} These sutras present a repeated sequence of events:{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=132-134}}
# ''Annupubbikathā'' ("graduated talk"), in which the Buddha explains the four truths; this talk frees the listener from the hindrances;
# This talk opens the ''dhammacakkhu'' ("dhamma eye"), and knowledge arises: "all that has the nature of arising has the nature of ending";{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=132}}{{refn|group=note|In effect to the exposition of the four truths, as presented in the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', the "dustless, stainless Dhamma eye" arose to Kondañña, stating: "Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."&lt;ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"/&gt;}}
# The request to become a member of the Buddhist order;
# A second talk by the Buddha, which destroys the ''āsavās'', impurities;
# The statement that "there are now ''x arahats'' in the world."

Yet, in other sutras, where the four truths have a propositional function, the comprehension of the four truths destroys the corruptions.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=146}} They do so in combination with the practice of the ''jhanas'' and the attainment of the divine eye, with which past lives and the working of rebirth are being seen.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=146-147}}

According to Anderson, following Schmithausen and Bronkhorst, these two presentations give two different models of the path to liberation, reflecting their function as a symbol and as a proposition.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=149}} Most likely, the four truths were first associated with the culmination of the path in the destruction of the ''āsavās'', where they substituted the unspecified "liberating insight"; as the canon developed, they became more logically associated with the beginning of the Buddhist path.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=149}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2000|p=79, 80}}

===Popularisation in the west===
According to Anderson there is a strong tendency within scholarship to present the four truths as the most essential teaching of Buddhism.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196}} According to Anderson, the four truths have been simplified and popularized in western writings, due to "the colonial project of gaining control over Buddhism."{{sfn|Crosby|2013}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=197}} According to Crosby, the Buddhist teachings are reduced to a "simple, single rationalized account," which has parallels in the reinterpretation of the Buddha in western literature.{{sfn|Crosby|2013}}

The presentation of the four truths as one of the most important teachings of the Buddha "has been [done] to reduce the four noble truths to a teaching that is accessible, pliable, and therefore readily appropriated by non-Buddhists."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=197}} There is a great variety of teachings in the Buddhist literature, which may be bewildering for those who are unaware of this variety.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196}} The four truths are easily accessible in this regard, and are "readily [understood] by those outside the Buddhist traditions."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196-197}} For example Walpola Rahula's ''What the Buddha Taught'', a widely used introductory text for non-Buddhists, uses the four truths as a framework to present an overview of the Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=197}}

According to Harris, the British in the 19th century crafted new representations of Buddhism and the Buddha.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=169}} 19th century missionaries studied Buddhism, to be more effective in their missionary efforts.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=120}} The Buddha was de-mystified, and reduced from a "superhuman" to a "compassionate, heroic human," serving "western historical method and the missionary agenda of situating the Buddha firmly below the divine."{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=169}} The four truths were discovered by the British by reading the Buddhist texts, and were not immediately granted the central position they later received.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=169}}

The writings of British missionaries show a growing emphasis on the four truths as being central to Buddhism, with somewhat different presentations of them.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=72-73}}{{refn|group=note| Whereas Gogerly wrote in 1861 "That sorrow is connected with existence in all its forms [and] [t]hat its continuance results from a continued desire of existence," Spencer Hardy wrote in 1866 that "there is sorrow connected with every mode of existence; that the cause of sorrow is desire."{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=72-73}} Childers, drawing on Gogerly and Hardy, writes that "existence is suffering; human passion (''tanhã'' - desire) is the cause of continued existence."{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=120}}}} This colonial project had a strong influence on some strands of Buddhism, culminating in socalled [[Protestant Buddhism]], which incorporated several essentially Protestant attitudes regarding religion, such as the emphasis on written texts.{{sfn|Gombrich|Obeyesekere|1988}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{refn|group=note|See David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/06/24/protestant-buddhism/ ''Protestant Buddhism''], [https://vividness.live/2011/06/28/a-new-world-religion/ ''A new World Religion''] and [https://vividness.live/2011/06/24/problems-with-scripture/ ''Problems with scripture''].}} According to Gimello, Rahula's book is an example of this Protestant Budhism, and "was created in an accommodating response to western expectations, and in nearly diametrical opposition to Buddhism as it had actually been practised in traditional Theravada."{{refn|group=note|Gimello (2004), as quoted in Taylor (2007).{{sfn|Taylor|2007|p=361}}}}

[[Hendrik Kern]] proposed in 1882 that the model of the four truths may be an analogy with classical Indian medicine, in which the four truths function as a medical diagnosis, and the Buddha is presented as a physician.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}{{refn|group=note|Kern's model:{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 909-911}}{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=52}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=42}}
# ''The truth of dukkha:'' identifying the illness and the nature of the illness (the [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]])
# ''The truth of origin:''  identifying the [[Cause (medicine)|causes of the illness]]
# ''The truth of cessation:'' identifying a cure for the illness (the [[prognosis]])
# ''The truth of the path:'' recommending a treatment for the illness that can bring about a cure (the [[Medical prescription|prescription]])}} Kern's analogy became rather popular,{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}{{refn|group=note|See,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 909-911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lopez|2001|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williams|2002|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} but "there is not sufficient historical evidence to conclude that the Buddha deliberately drew upon a clearly defined medical model for his fourfold analysis of human pain."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}

According to Anderson, those scholars who did not place the four truths at the center of Buddhism, either "located the four truths in a fuller reading of the Theravada canon and the larger context of South Asian literature," or "located the teaching within an experience of Buddhism as practiced in a contemporary setting."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=198}} According to Anderson, "these autors suggest a more complex reading of the four noble truths than those who locate the teaching as the key to or as a crucial element within the grand scheme of Buddhism."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=198}}

==Appearance within the discourses==
The developing Buddhist tradition inserted the four truths, using various formulations, at various sutras.{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} They are being used both as a symbol of all dhammas and the Buddha's awakening, and as a set of propositions which function within a matrix of teachings.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=86}} According to Anderson, there is no single way to understand the teachings; one teaching may be used to explain another teaching, and vice versa. The teachings form a network, which should be apprehended as such to understand how the various teachings intersect with each other.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=86-87}}

===Symbolic function===

====''Mahasaccaka Sutta''====
The ''Mahasaccaka Sutta'' ("The Greater Discourse to Saccaka", Majjhima Nikaya 36) gives one of several versions of the Buddha's way to liberation.{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26, "The Noble Search," also gives an account, which is markedly different, omitting the ascetic practices and the four truths.}} He attains the three knowledges, namely knowledge of his former lifes, knowledge of death and rebirth, and knowledge of the destruction of the taints,{{refn|group=note|Which keep one trapped in ''samsara''.}} the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995}} After going through the four dhyanas, and gaining the first two knowledges, the story proceeds:
{{quote|I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants [suffering ... origin ... cessation ... path] [intoxicants (''asava'') ... origin ... cessation ... path] My mind was liberated [...] the knowledge arose that it was liberated.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=102-103}}}}

Bronkhorst dismisses the first two knowledges as later additions, and proceeds to notice that the recognition of the intoxicants is modelled on the four truths. According to Bronkhorst, those are added the bridge the original sequence of "I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants. My mind was liberated", which was interrupted by the addition of the four truths. Bronkhorst points out that those do not fit here, since the four truths culminate in the knowledge of the path to be followed, while the Buddha himself is already liberated at that point.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=103-104}}

====''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta''====
[[File:Gandharan - Expounding the Law - Walters 2551.jpg|right|thumb|A relief depicting the first discourse of the Buddha, from the 2nd century (Kushan).&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21971 Expounding the Law], [[The Walters Art Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum. The Buddha's hand can be seen at right.]]

According to the Buddhist tradition, the first talk of [[Gautama Buddha]] after he attained [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] is recorded in the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' ("Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dhamma", Samyutta Nikaya 56.11). The ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' provides details on three stages in the understanding of each truth, for a total of twelve insights. The three stages for understanding each truth are:{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle loc. 3935-3939}}{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|pp=99-100}}{{sfn|Ajahn Sumedho|2002|loc=p. 9}}{{sfn|Moffitt|2002|loc=Kindle loc. 225-226}}{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 303-306}}
# ''sacca-ñāṇa'' - knowing the nature of the truth (e.g., acknowledgement, view, reflection)
# ''kicca-ñāṇa'' - knowing what needs to be done in connection with that truth (e.g., practice; motivation; directly experiencing)
# ''kata-ñāṇa'' - accomplishing what needs to be done (e.g., result, full understanding, knowing)

These three stages of understanding are emphasized particularly in the Theravada tradition, but they are also recognized by some contemporary Mahayana teachers.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 303-306}}{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hahn|1999|pp=28-46}}

According to Cousins, many scholars are of the view that "this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date."{{sfn|Cousins|2002|p=3}} According to Stephen Batchelor, the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' contains incongruities, and states that
{{quote|The First Discourse cannot be treated as a verbatim transcript of what the Buddha taught in the Deer Park, but as a document that has evolved over an unspecified period of time until it reached the form in which it is found today in the canons of the different Buddhist schools.{{sfn|Batchelor|2012|p=91}}}}

According to Bronkhorst this "first sermon" is recorded in several sutras, with important variations.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}} In the Vinaya texts, and in the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' which was influenced by the Vinaya texts, the four truths are included, and Kondañña is enlightened{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=69}} when the "vision of Dhamma"{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=1846}} arises in him: "whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."{{refn|group=note|Translation Bhikkhu Bodhi (2000), ''Samyutta Nikaya'', SN 56.11, p.1846. See also Anderson (2001), ''Pain and its Ending'', p.69.}} Yet, in the ''Ariyapariyesanā Sutta'' ("The Noble Search", Majjhima Nikaya 26) the four truths are not included,{{refn|group=note|MN 26.17 merely says "[']This will serve for the striving of a clansman intent on striving.' And I sat down there thinking: 'This will serve for striving.'{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=259}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi Majjhima Nikaya 36 then continuous with the extreme ascetic practices, which are omitted in MN 26.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=1216, note 403}} In verse 18, the Buddha has attained Nirvana, being secured from bondage by birth, ageing, sickness and death, referring to the truths of dependent origination and "the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all attachments, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=259-260}}}} and the Buddha gives the five ascetics personal instructions in turn, two or three of them, while the others go out begging for food. The versions of the "first sermon" which include the four truths, such as the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', omit this instruction, showing that
{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the subsequent destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}

According to Bronkhorst, this indicates that the four truths were later added to earlier descriptions of liberation by practicing the four dhyanas, which originally was thought to be sufficient for the destruction of the arsavas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}} Anderson, following Norman, also thinks that the four truths originally were not part of this sutta, and were later added in some versions.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=68}}{{refn|group=note|According to Cousins, Anderson misunderstands Norman in this respect, but does "not think that this misunderstanding of Norman's position critically affects Anderson's thesis. Even if these arguments do not prove that the four truths are definitely a later insertion in the Dhammacakkapavattana-sutta, it is certainly possible to take the position that the sutta itself is relatively late."{{sfn|Cousins|2002|p=3}}}}

According to Bronkhorst, the "twelve insights" are probably also a later addition, born out of unease with the substitution of the general term "prajna" for the more specific "four truths".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=106}}

====''Maha-parinibbana Sutta''====
According to the Buddhist tradition, the ''[[Maha-parinibbana Sutta]]'' (Last Days of the Buddha, Digha Nikaya 16) was given near the end of the Buddha's life. This sutta "gives a good general idea of the Buddha's Teaching:"&lt;ref group=web name="ati_Maha-parinibbana_Sutta"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html ''Maha-parinibbana Sutta: Last Days of the Buddha'', translated by Sister Vajira &amp; Francis Story]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Bhikkhus, it is through not realizing, through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you. What are these four? They are the noble truth of suffering; the noble truth of the origin of suffering; the noble truth of the cessation of suffering; and the noble truth of the way to the cessation of suffering. But now, bhikkhus, that these have been realized and penetrated, cut off is the craving for existence, destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming, and there is no fresh becoming."

Thus it was said by the Blessed One. And the Happy One, the Master, further said:
:Through not seeing the Four Noble Truths,
:Long was the weary path from birth to birth.
:When these are known, removed is rebirth's cause,
:The root of sorrow plucked; then ends rebirth.}}

===Propositional function===

====''Maha-salayatanika Sutta''====
The ''Maha-salayatanika Sutta'', Majjhima Nikaya 149:3 plus 149:9, give an alternative presentation of the four truths:
{{quote|When one abides inflamed by lust, fettered, infatuated, contemplating gratification, [...] [o]ne's bodily and mental troubles increase, one's bodily and mental torments increase, one's bodily and mental fevers increase, and one experiences bodily and mental suffering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...when one does not know and see as it actually is [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as condition, then one is inflamed by lust for the eye, for forms, for eye-consciousness, for eye-contact, for [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as condition [repeated for the nose, tongue, body, mind].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When one abides uninflamed by lust, unfettered, uninfatuated, contemplating danger [...] one's craving [...] is abandoned. One's bodily and mental troubles are abandoned, one's bodily and mental torments are abandoned, one's bodily and mental fevers are abandoned, and one experiences bodily and mental pleasure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...when one knows and see as it actually is [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as condition, then one is not inflamed by lust for the eye, for forms, for eye-consciousness, for eye-contact, for [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as condition [repeated for the nose, tongue, body, mind].{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=1137}}}}

==Emphasis within different traditions==

===Early Indian Buddhism===
The [[Ekavyāvahārika]] sect emphasized the transcendence of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], asserting that he was eternally enlightened and essentially non-physical. According to the Ekavyāvahārika, the words of the Buddha were spoken with one transcendent meaning, and the Four Noble Truths are to be understood simultaneously in one moment of insight.{{sfn|Rockhill |1884|pp=187-188}} According to the [[Mahīśāsaka]] sect, the Four Noble Truths should be meditated upon simultaneously.{{sfn|Potter|2004|p=106}}

===Theravada===
{{See also|Vipassana movement}}

According to Carol Anderson, the four truths have "a singular position within the Theravada canon and tradition."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}} The Theravada tradition regards insight in the four truths as liberating in itself.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}} As Walpola Rahula states, "when the Truth is seen, all the forces which feverishly produce the continuity of [[samsara]] in [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|illusion]] become calm and incapable of producing any more [[Karma in Buddhism|karma-formations]] [...] he is free from [...] the 'thirst' for becoming."&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Walpola Rahula:
* "When wisdom is developed and cultivated according to the Fourth Noble Truth (the next to be taken up), it sees the secret of life, the reality of things as they are. When the secret is discovered, when the Truth is seen, all the forces which feverishly produce the continuity of saṃsāra in illusion become calm and incapable of producing any more karma-formations, because there is no more illusion, no more ‘thirst’ for continuity."&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt; 
* "The remaining two factors, namely Right Thought and Right Understanding go to constitute Wisdom."&lt;ref group=web name="WP_ch5"&gt;Walpola Rahula, [https://sites.google.com/site/rahulawhatthebuddha/the-fourth-noble-truth Chapert 5. ''Magga'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Right Understanding is the understanding of things as they are, and it is the Four Noble Truths that explain things as they really are. Right Understanding therefore is ultimately reduced to the understanding of the Four Noble Truths. This understanding is the highest wisdom which sees the Ultimate Reality."&lt;ref group=web name="WP_ch5"/&gt;}} This liberation can be attained in one single moment, when the four truths are understood together.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}} Within the [[Theravada]] tradition, great emphasis is placed upon reading and contemplating ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|The Discourse That Sets Turning the Wheel of Truth]]'', and other suttas, as a means to study the four noble truths and put them into practice.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 275-280}} For example, Ajahn Sumedho states: 
{{quote|The ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', the Buddha's teaching on the Four Noble Truths, has been the main reference that I have used for my practice over the years. It is the teaching we used in our monastery in Thailand. The Theravada school of Buddhism regards this sutta as the quintessence of the teachings of the Buddha. This one sutta contains all that is necessary for understanding the Dhamma and for enlightenment."{{sfn|Ajahn Sumedho| 2002|p=5}}}}

Within the Theravada-tradition, three different stances on ''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]]'' and the question what happens with the ''Arhat'' after death can be found.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=77}}{{sfn|Hick|1994|p=436}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|[96-97}}{{sfn|Geisler|Amano|2004|p=32}} ''Nirvana'' refers to the cessation of the defilements and the resulting peace of mind and happiness (''khlesa-nirvana''); to the final dissolution of the five skandhas at the time of death (''skandha-nirvana'' or ''[[parinirvana]]''); and to a transcendental reality which is "known at the moment of awakening."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=77}}{{refn|group=note|Gethin: "(I) it is the extinguishing of the defilements of greed, hatred, and delusion; (2) it is the final condition of the Buddha and arhats after death consequent upon the extinction of the defilements; (3) it is the unconditioned realm known at the moment of awakening.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=77}}}} According to Gethin, "modern Buddhist usage tends to restrict 'nirvāṇa' to the awakening experience and reserve 'parinirvāṇa' for the death experience.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=76}} According to Geisler and Amano, in the "minimal Theravada interpretation", ''nirvana'' is a psychological state, which ends with the dissolution of the body and the total extinction of existence.{{sfn|Hick|1994|p=436}}{{sfn|Geisler|Amano|2004|p=32}} According to Geisler and Amano, the "orthodox Theravada interpretation" is that nirvana is a transcendent reality with which the self unites.{{sfn|Geisler|Amano|2004|p=32}} According to Bronkhorst, while "Buddhism preached liberation in this life, i.e. before death,"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|p=96}} there was also a tendency in Buddhism to think of liberation happening after death. According to Bronkhorst, this 
{{quote|...becomes visible in those canonical passages which distinguish between Nirvana - qualified in Sanskrit and pali as 'without a remainder of upadhi/upadi (anupadhisesa/anupadisesa) - and the 'highest and complete enlightenment'(anuttara samyaksambodhi/sammasambodhi). The former occurs at death, the latter in life.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=97}}}}

According to [[Walpola Rahula]], the cessation of ''dukkha'' is ''nirvana'', the ''summum bonum'' of Buddhism, and is attained in this life, not when one dies.&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt; ''Nirvana'' is "perfect freedom, peace, tranquility and happiness,"&lt;ref group=web&gt;Walpola Rahula, [https://sites.google.com/site/rahulawhatthebuddha/the-first-noble-truth ''What the Buddha Taught.

{{quote|... if Nirvāṇa is to be expressed and explained in positive terms, we are likely immediately to grasp an idea associated with those terms, which may be quite the contrary. Therefore it is generally expressed in negative terms."&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt;{{refn|group=subnote|According to Gombrich this distinction between [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] and cataphatic approaches can be found in all religions.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=150-152}}}}}} Rahula gives an overview of negative statements of ''nirvana,'' whereafter he states:
{{quote|Because Nirvana is thus expressed in negative terms, there are many who have got a wrong notion that it is negative, and expresses self-annihilation. Nirvāṇa is definitely no annihilation of self, because there is no self to annihilate. If at all, it is the annihilation of the illusion of the false idea of self.&lt;br&gt;
It is incorrect to say that Nirvāṇa is negative or positive. The ideas of ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ are relative, and are within the realm of duality. These terms cannot be applied to Nirvāṇa, Absolute Truth, which is beyond duality and relativity [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nirvāṇa is neither cause nor effect. It is beyond cause and effect. Truth is not a result nor an effect. It is not produced like a mystic, spiritual, mental state, such as dhyāna or samādhi. TRUTH IS. NIRVĀṆA IS.&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt;}}

Rahula refers to the ''Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta'' (the Majjhima-nikāya 140) for his interpretation of "Nirvāṇa as Absolute Truth," which, according to Rahula, says: 
{{quote|O bhikkhu, that which is unreality (mosadhamma) is false; that which is reality (amosadhamma), Nibbāna, is Truth (Sacca). Therefore, O bhikkhu, a person so endowed is endowed with this Absolute Truth. For, the Absolute Noble Truth (paramaṃ ariyasaccaṃ) is Nibbāna, which is Reality.’&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt;}}

While Jayatilleke translates ''amosadhamma'' as "ineffable,"{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2009|p=306}} Thanissaro Bhikkhu gives a somewhat different translation:
{{quote|His release, being founded on truth, does not fluctuate, for whatever is deceptive is false; Unbinding — the undeceptive — is true. Thus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for truth, for this — Unbinding, the undeceptive — is the highest noble truth.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.140.than.html ''Dhatu-vibhanga Sutta: An Analysis of the Properties'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to Rahula, [[Richard Gombrich]] states that:
{{quote|In proclaiming (in block capitals) that 'Truth is', Rahula has for a moment fallen into Upanisadic mode. Since truth can only be a property of propositions, which have subjects and predicates, and nirvana is not a proposition, it makes no sense in English to say that nirvana is truth. The confusion arises, perhaps, because the Sanskrit word satyam and the corresponding Pali word saccam can indeed mean either 'truth' or 'reality'. But in our language this will not work.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=156-157}}}}

Richard Gombrich also states that Rahula's book would more aptly be titled ''What [[Buddhagosa]] Taught''.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=156-157}}  According to David Kalupahana, Buddhagosa was influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, and introduced "the substantialist as well as essentialist standpoints of the Sarvastavadins and Sautrantikas."{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=208, 210}}}}&lt;!-- **END OF NOTE** --&gt; Jayatilleke also speaks of "the attainment of an ultimate reality."{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2009|p=306}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the "elimination of craving culminates not only in the extinction of sorrow, anguish and distress, but in the unconditioned freedom of nibbana, which is won with the ending of reapeated rebirth."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2011|p=10}}

According to Spiro, most (lay) Theravada Buddhists do not aspire for ''nirvana'' and total extinction, but for a pleasurable rebirth in heaven.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=76-77}} According to Spiro, this presents a "serious conflict" since the Buddhist texts and teaching "describe life as suffering and hold up nirvana as the ''summum bonum.''"{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=78}} In response to this deviation, "monks and others emphasize that the hope for nirvana is the only legitimate action for Buddhist action."{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=78}} Nevertheless, according to Spiro most Burmese lay Buddhists do not aspire for the extinction of existence which is ''nirvana''.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=78}}{{refn|group=note|name="Wallace"}}

According to [[B.R. Ambedkar]], the Indian Buddhist [[Dalit]] leader, the four truths were not part of the original teachings of the Buddha, but a later aggregation, due to Hindu influences.{{sfn|Karunyakara|2002|p=67}} According to Ambedkar, total cessation of suffering is an illusion; yet, the Buddhist Middle Path aims at the reduction of suffering and the maximizing of happiness, balancing both sorrow and happiness.{{sfn|Karunyakara|2002|p=67-68}}

===Mahayana===
The four truths are less prominent in the Mahayana traditions, which emphasize insight into [[Śūnyatā]] and the [[bodhisattva|Bodhisattva path]] as a central elements in their teachings.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179-3180}} If the sutras in general are studied at all, it is through various Mahayana commentaries.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=103}}

According to Makransky the Mahayana Bodhisattva ideal created tensions in the explanation of the four truths.{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=345}} In the Mahayana view, a fully enlightened Buddha does not leave ''samsara'', but remains in the world out of compassion for all sentient beings.{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346}} The four truths, which aim at ending ''samsara'', do not provide a doctrinal basis for this view, and had to be reinterpreted.{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346}} In the old view, ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|klesas]]'' and ''karma'' are the cause of prolonged existence. According to Makransky, "[t]o remove those causes was, at physical death, to extinguish one's conditioned existence, hence to end forever one's participation in the world (Third Truth)."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346}} According to Makransky, the question of how a liberated being can still be "pervasively operative in this world" has been "a seminal source of ongoing doctrinal tension over Buddhahood throughout the history of the Mahayana in India and Tibet."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346-347}}

====Tibetan Buddhism====
[[Atisha]], in his ''[[Bodhipathapradīpa]]'' ("A Lamp for the Path to Awakening"), which forms the basis for the [[Lamrim]] tradition, discerns three levels of motivation for Buddhist practitioners.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17}} At the beginning level of motivation, one strives toward a better life in ''samsara''.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17}} At the intermediate level, one strives to a liberation from existence in samsara and the end of all suffering.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17, 66-67}} At the highest level of motivation, one strives after the liberation  of all living beings.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17}} In his commentary on the text, Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche explains that the four truths are to be meditated upon as a means of practice for the intermediate level.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=66-67}}

According to [[Tashi Tsering (Jamyang Buddhist Centre)|Geshe Tashi Tsering]], within [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the four noble truths are studied as part of the Bodhisattva path. They are explained in Mahayana commentaries such as the ''[[Abhisamayalamkara]]'', a summary of and commentary on the [[Prajna Paramitra]] sutras, where they form part of the lower [[Hinayana]] teachings. The truth of the path (the fourth truth) is traditionally presented according to a progressive formula of [[Five Paths|five paths]], rather than as the eightfold path presented in Theravada.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 2187-2190}} According to Tsering, the study of the four truths is combined with the study of the [[sixteen characteristics]] of the four noble truths.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 741-743}}

Some contemporary Tibetan Buddhist teachers have provided commentary on the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' and the noble eightfold path when presenting the dharma to Western students.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 241}}{{sfn|Ringu Tulku|2005|pp=36-54}}{{sfn|Lama Surya Das|1997}}

====Nichiren Buddhism====
[[Nichiren Buddhism]] is based on the teaching of the Japanese priest and teacher [[Nichiren]], who believed that the [[Lotus Sūtra]] contained the essence of all of Gautama Buddha's teachings.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nichiren-shu.org.uk/septoctnewsletter.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031180446/http://www.nichiren-shu.org.uk/septoctnewsletter.html |archive-date=31 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third chapter of the Lotus Sutra states that the Four Noble Truths was the early teaching of the Buddha, while the Dharma of the Lotus is the "most wonderful, unsurpassed great Dharma."&lt;ref group=web &gt;[http://www.sokahumanism.com/nichiren-buddhism/Four_Noble_Truths_and_the_Lotus_Sutra.html Quote from Watson (1993), The Lotus Sutra]&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings on the four noble truths are a provisional teaching, which Shakyamuni Buddha taught according to the people’s capacity, while the Lotus Sutra is a direct statement of Shakyamuni’s own enlightenment.&lt;ref group=web name=nletter2&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=1039&amp;m=3&amp;q=four%20noble%20truths%20for%20voice-hearers Four Noble truths for Voice Hearers], see "Background" section&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Buddhism===
For many western Buddhists, the rebirth doctrine in the Four Noble Truths teaching is a problematic notion.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}{{sfn|Hayes|2013|p=172}}{{sfn|Lamb|2001|p=258}}&lt;ref group=web name="BB-rebirth"&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_46.html ''Does Rebirth Make Sense?'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also:&lt;br&gt;* [[James Ishmael Ford|James Ford]], [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2015/08/the-karma-and-rebirth-debate-within-contemporary-western-buddhism-some-links-to-follow.html ''The Karma and Rebirth Debate Within Contemporary Western Buddhism: Some Links to Follow'']&lt;br&gt;* Manon Welles, [http://aristocratsofthesoul.com/secular-buddhism-vs-traditional-buddhism-six-key-differences/ ''Secular Buddhism vs. Traditional Buddhism: 6 Key Differences'']&lt;br&gt;* Alan Peta, [http://www.alanpeto.com/buddhism/understanding-reincarnation-rebirth/ ''Reincarnation and Buddhism: Here We Go Again'']&lt;br&gt;* David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/06/16/the-making-of-buddhist-modernism/ ''The Making of Buddhist Modernism'']}} According to Lamb, "Certain forms of modern western Buddhism [...] see it as purely mythical and thus a dispensable notion."{{sfn|Lamb|2001|p=258}} According to Coleman, the focus of most vipassana students in the west "is mainly on meditation practice and a kind of down-to-earth psychological wisdom."{{sfn|Coleman|2002|p=110}}{{refn|group=note|According to Coleman, the goal in Theravada Buddhism "is to uproot the desires and defilements in order to attain nibbana (nirvana in Sanskrit) and win liberation from the otherwise endless round of death and rebirth. But few Western Vipassana teachers pay much attention to the more metaphysical aspects of such concepts as rebirth and nibbana, and of course very few of their students are celibate monks. Their focus is mainly on meditation practice and a kind of down-to-earth psychological wisdom. "As a result," one respected Vipassana teacher writes, "many more Americans of European descent refer to themselves as Vipassana students rather than as students of Theravada Buddhism."{{sfn|Coleman|2002|p=110}}}} According to [[Damien Keown]], westerners find "the ideas of [[karma]] and rebirth puzzling."{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}} According to Gowans, many Western followers and people interested in exploring Buddhism are skeptical and object to the belief in karma and rebirth foundational to the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}}{{refn|group=note|Gowans groups the objections into three categories. The first objection can be called "consistency objection", which asks if "there is no self (atman, soul), then what is reborn and how does karma work?". The second objection can be called "naturalism objection", which asks "can rebirth be scientifically proven, what evidence is there that rebirth happens". The third objection can be called "morality objection", which asks "why presume that an infant born with an illness, is because of karma in previous life" as seems implied by ''Majjhima Nikāya'' section 3.204 for example. Gowans provides a summary of prevaling answers, clarifications and explanations proffered by practicing Buddhists.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}}}} According to Konik,
{{quote|Since the fundamental problems underlying early Indian Buddhism and contemporary western Buddhism are not the same, the validity of applying the set of solutions developed by the first to the situation of the second becomes a question of great importance. Simply putting an end to rebirth would not necessarily strike the western Buddhist as the ultimate answer, as it certainly was for early Indian Buddhists.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}}}

According to Keown, it is possible to reinterpret the Buddhist doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths, since the final goal and the answer to the problem of suffering is [[nirvana]], and not rebirth.{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}} Some Western interpreters have proposed what is sometimes referred to as "naturalized Buddhism". It is devoid of rebirth, karma, nirvana, realms of existence, and other concepts of Buddhism, with doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths reformulated and restated in modernistic terms.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 91–94}}{{sfn|Prothero|1996|p=128}}{{refn|group=note|Prothereo describes how Theosophist [[Henry Steel Olcott]] (1832-1907) reinterpreted Buddhism: "In addition to a restatement of the Four Noble Truths and the Five Precepts for lay Buddhists, the fourteen propositions included: an affirmation of religious tolerance and of the evolution of the universe, a rejection of supernaturalism, heaven or hell, and superstition, and an emphasis on education and the use of reason."{{sfn|Prothero|1996|p=128}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Owen Flanagan, the proportion of people in North America that believe in heaven is about the same as the proportion of East and Southeast Asia who believe in rebirth. But, 'rebirth' is considered superstitious by many in the West while 'heaven' is not, adds Flanagan, though a reflective naturalistic approach demands that both 'heaven' and 'rebirth' be equally questioned".{{sfn|Flanagan|2011|p=2–3, 68–70, 79–80}} According to Donald S. Lopez, Buddhist movements in the West have reconstructed a "Scientific Buddha" and a "modern Buddhism" unknown in Asia, "one that may never have existed there before the late  19th-century".{{sfn|Lopez|2012|p=39-43, 57–60, 74-76, 122-124}}}} This "deflated secular Buddhism" stresses compassion, impermanence, causality, selfless persons, no Boddhisattvas, no nirvana, no rebirth, and a naturalists approach to well-being of oneself and others.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=39–42}}

According to Melford Spiro, this approach undermines the Four Noble Truths, for it does not address the existential question for the Buddhist as to "why live? why not commit suicide, hasten the end of ''dukkha'' in current life by ending life". In traditional Buddhism, rebirth continues the ''dukkha'' and the path to cessation of ''dukkha'' isn't suicide, but the fourth reality of the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=39–42}} The "naturalized Buddhism", according to Gowans, is a radical revision to traditional Buddhist thought and practice, and it attacks the structure behind the hopes, needs and rationalization of the realities of human life to traditional Buddhists in East, Southeast and South Asia.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 91–94}} According to Keown, it may not be necessary to believe in some of the core Buddhist doctrines to be a Buddhist, but the rebirth, karma, [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|realms of existence]] and cyclic universe doctrines underpin the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism.{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}}

Traditional Buddhist scholars disagree with these modernist Western interpretations. Bhikkhu Bodhi, for example, states that rebirth is an integral part of the Buddhist teachings as found in the sutras, despite the problems that "modernist interpreters of Buddhism" seem to have with it.&lt;ref group=web name="BB-rebirth"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: "Newcomers to Buddhism are usually impressed by the clarity, directness, and earthy practicality of the Dhamma as embodied in such basic teachings as the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the threefold training. These teachings, as clear as day-light, are accessible to any serious seeker looking for a way beyond suffering. When, however, these seekers encounter the doctrine of rebirth, they often balk, convinced it just doesn't make sense. At this point, they suspect that the teaching has swerved off course, tumbling from the grand highway of reason into wistfulness and speculation. Even modernist interpreters of Buddhism seem to have trouble taking the rebirth teaching seriously. Some dismiss it as just a piece of cultural baggage, "ancient Indian metaphysics," that the Buddha retained in deference to the world view of his age. Others interpret it as a metaphor for the change of mental states, with the realms of rebirth seen as symbols for psychological archetypes. A few critics even question the authenticity of the texts on rebirth, arguing that they must be interpolations.&lt;br&gt;A quick glance at the Pali suttas would show that none of these claims has much substance. The teaching of rebirth crops up almost everywhere in the Canon, and is so closely bound to a host of other doctrines that to remove it would virtually reduce the Dhamma to tatters. Moreover, when the suttas speak about rebirth into the five realms — the hells, the animal world, the spirit realm, the human world, and the heavens — they never hint that these terms are meant symbolically. To the contrary, they even say that rebirth occurs "with the breakup of the body, after death," which clearly implies they intend the idea of rebirth to be taken quite literally."&lt;ref group=web name="BB-rebirth"/&gt;}} [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], as another example, rejects the "modern argument" that "one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth." He states, "rebirth has always been a central teaching in the Buddhist tradition."&lt;ref group=web name="TB_Rebirth"&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/truth_of_rebirth.html ''The Truth of Rebirth. And Why it Matters for Buddhist Practice'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Thanissaro Bhikkhu: "A second modern argument against accepting the canonical accounts of what's known in awakening — and in particular, the knowledge of rebirth achieved in awakening — is that one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth. After all, all the factors leading to suffering are all immediately present to awareness, so there should be no need, when trying to abandon them, to accept any premises about where they may or may not lead in the future.&lt;br&gt;This objection, however, ignores the role of appropriate attention on the path. As we noted above, one of its roles is to examine and abandon the assumptions that underlie one's views on the metaphysics of personal identity. Unless you're willing to step back from your own views — such as those concerning what a person is, and why that makes rebirth impossible — and subject them to this sort of examination, there's something lacking in your path. You'll remain entangled in the questions of inappropriate attention, which will prevent you from actually identifying and abandoning the causes of suffering and achieving the full results of the practice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, the terms of appropriate attention — the four noble truths — are not concerned simply with events arising and passing away in the present moment. They also focus on the causal connections among those events, connections that occur both in the immediate present and over time. If you limit your focus solely to connections in the present while ignoring those over time, you can't fully comprehend the ways in which craving causes suffering: not only by latching on to the four kinds of nutriment, but also giving rise to the four kinds of nutriment as well.&lt;ref group=web name="TB_Rebirth"/&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|According to Konik: {{quote|No doubt, according to the early Indian Buddhist tradition, the Buddha's great discovery, as condensed in his experience of nirvana, involved the remembrance of his many former existences, presupposing as fact the reality of a never-ending process of rebirth as a source of deep anxiety, and an acceptance of the Buddha's overcoming of that fate as ultimate liberation.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}}}}}

According to Owen Flanagan, the Dalai Lama states that "Buddhists believe in rebirth" and that this belief has been common among his followers. However, the Dalai Lama's belief, adds Flanagan, is more sophisticated than ordinary Buddhists, because it is not the same as [[reincarnation]]--rebirth in Buddhism is envisioned as happening without the assumption of an "atman, self, soul", but rather through a "consciousness conceived along the [[anatta|anatman]] lines".{{sfn|Flanagan|2014|pp=233-234 with note 1}}{{refn|group=note|The Dalai Lama himself is regarded to be an incarnation of the thirteen previous Dalai Lamas, who are all manifestations of [[Avalokitasvara]].{{sfn|Chitkara|1998|p=39}}}} The doctrine of rebirth is considered mandatory in Tibetan Buddhism, and across many Buddhist sects.{{sfn|Flanagan|2014|pp=234-235 with note 5}}

According to Christopher Gowans, for "most ordinary Buddhists, today as well as in the past, their basic moral orientation is governed by belief in karma and rebirth".{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}} Buddhist morality hinges on the hope of well being in this lifetime or in future rebirths, with nirvana (enlightenment) a project for a future lifetime. A denial of karma and rebirth undermines their history, moral orientation and religious foundations.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}} According to Keown, most Buddhists in Asia do accept these traditional teachings, and seek better rebirth.{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}}{{refn|group=note|The vast majority of Buddhist lay people, states Kevin Trainor, have historically pursued Buddhist rituals and practices motivated with rebirth into Deva realm.{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=62}} Fowler and others concur with Trainor, stating that better rebirth, not nirvana, has been the primary focus of a vast majority of lay Buddhists. This they attempt through merit accumulation and good ''kamma''.{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=65}}{{refn|group=note|Merv Foweler: "For a vast majority of Buddhists in Theravadin countries, however, the order of monks is seen by lay Buddhists as a means of gaining the most merit in the hope of accumulating good karma for a better rebirth."{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=65}}}}{{sfn|Gowans|2004|p=169}}}}

Gone, for instance, were the doctrines of karma and rebirth, the traditional emphasis on renunciation of the world, the practice of meditation, and the experience of enlightenment. Gone too were any teachings that implied the existence of a trans-empirical realm (...). Most jarring, perhaps, especially among more traditional Buddhists, was the absence of the Four Noble Truths, which Ambedkar regarded as the invention of wrong-headed monks".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gay bashing''' and '''gay bullying''' is [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse]] against a person who is perceived by the aggressor to be  [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], including persons who identify as  [[heterosexual]].

A "[[Bashing (pejorative)|bashing]]" may be a specific incident, and one could also use the verb ''to bash'' (e.g. "I was gay bashed."). A verbal gay bashing might use sexual slurs, expletives, [[intimidation]], and threatened or actual violence. It also might take place in a political forum and include one or more common [[anti-gay slogan]]s.

Gay bullying involves intentional and unprovoked actions toward the victim, repeated negative actions by one or more people against another person, and an imbalance of physical or psychological power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=US Dept of Education |title=Bullying Myths and Facts |accessdate=October 2, 2010 |url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/training/bullying/bullying_pg3.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325204905/http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/training/bullying/bullying_pg3.html |archivedate=March 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar terms such as ''lesbian bullying'', ''[[queer]] bullying'', and ''queer bashing'' may also be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/violence-against-queer-people/9780813573151|title=Violence against Queer People|last=Meyer|first=Doug|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand section|date=December 2010}}

Gay bashing has occurred worldwide for many decades and continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas|last=Rogers|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/12/12/lgbt_bullying_interview/|title=Explaining American schools' gay bullying epidemic|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homophobia in the United States]] was especially serious in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when many gay people were forced out of government by boards set up by Presidents [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sears|first1=Brad|last2=Hunter|first2=Nan D.|last3=Mallory|first3=Christy|title=Documenting Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in State Employment|date=September 2009|publisher=The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy at UCLA School of Law|location=Los Angeles|page=5–3|url=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/5_History.pdf#page=3|quote=From 1947 to 1961, more than 5,000 allegedly homosexual federal civil servants lost their jobs in the purges for no reason other than sexual orientation, and thousands of applicants were also rejected for federal employment for the same reason. During this period, more than 1,000 men and women were fired for suspected homosexuality from the State Department alone—a far greater number than were dismissed for their membership in the Communist party. The Cold War and anti-communist efforts provided the setting in which a sustained attack upon gay men and lesbians took place. The history of this 'Lavender Scare' by the federal government has been extensively documented by historian David Johnson. Johnson has demonstrated that during this era government officials intentionally engaged in campaigns to associate homosexuality with Communism: 'homosexual' and 'pervert' became synonyms for 'Communist' and 'traitor.' LGBT people were treated as a national security threat, demanding the attention of Congress, the courts, statehouses, and the media.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As historian [[David K. Johnson]] explains:&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/404811in.html|publisher=University of Chicago Press|title=An interview with David K. Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The [[Lavender Scare]] helped fan the flames of the [[Red Scare]]. In popular discourse, [[communist]]s and homosexuals were often conflated. Both groups were perceived as hidden [[subculture]]s with their own meeting places, literature, cultural codes, and bonds of loyalty. Both groups were thought to recruit to their ranks the psychologically weak or disturbed. And both groups were considered immoral and godless. Many people believed that the two groups were working together to undermine the government.}}

Johnson concludes that Senator [[Joe McCarthy]], notorious for his attacks on alleged communists in government, was often pressured by his allies to denounce homosexuals in government, but he resisted and did not do so.&lt;ref name="uchicago" /&gt; Using rumors collected by [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], one [[Nevada]] publisher wrote in 1952 that both McCarthy and his chief counsel, [[Roy Cohn]], were homosexuals.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;After McCarthy called him an ex-Communist, [[Hank Greenspun]] wrote: "It is common talk among homosexuals in [[Milwaukee]] who rendezvous in the White Horse Inn that Senator Joe McCarthy has often engaged in homosexual activities." [[Las Vegas Sun]], October 25, 1952. McCarthy later explained he meant to call Greenspun an ex-convict (which was true), rather than an ex-Communist (which was false).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Washington Post]]'' editor [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]] said, "There was a lot of time spent investigating" these allegations, "although no one came close to proving it."  No reputable McCarthy biographer has accepted it as probable.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The allegations are specifically rejected in Richard Rovere, ''Senator Joe McCarthy'' (1969), p. 68; see also Robert D. Dean, ''Imperial Brotherhood: Gender and the Making of Cold War Foreign Policy'' (2001) p. 149 (includes Bradlee quote); Kyle A. Cuordileone, ''Manhood and American Political Culture in the Cold War'' (2003), p. 94; Thomas Patrick Doherty, ''Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture,'' (2003), p. 228. Geoff Schumacher, ''Sun, Sin &amp; Suburbia: An Essential History of Modern Las Vegas'' (2004), p. 144, concludes, "Greenspun descended into mud-spewing rhetoric that would make the [[National Enquirer]] blanch." Knowing that McCarthy would not dare enter Nevada, where he would be served with a lawsuit for defaming Greenspun, Greenspun punished McCarthy with his own weapon of anonymous, scandalous accusations.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queer bullying ===

[[Egale Canada]] conducted a survey of more than 3700 high school students in Canada between December 2007 and June 2009. The final report of the survey, "Every Class in Every School",&lt;ref&gt;[http://egale.ca/youth-and-safer-schools/every-class/ Every Class in Every School], Final Report on the First National Climate Survey on Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia in Canadian Schools, Egale Canada&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2011, found that 70% of all students participating heard "that's so gay" daily at school, and 48% of respondents heard "faggot", "lezbo" and "dyke" daily. 58% or about 1400 of the 2400 heterosexual students participating in EGALE's survey found homophobic comments upsetting.
Further, EGALE found that students not directly affected by [[homophobia]], [[biphobia]] or [[transphobia]] were less aware of it. This finding relates to research done in the area of [[Empathy gap|empathy gaps for social pain]] which suggests that those not directly experiencing social pain (in this case, bullying) consistently underestimate its effects and thus may not adequately respond to the needs of one experiencing social pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nordgren | first1 = L.

== Causes of queer bullying ==

Gay and lesbian youth can develop severe forms of depression and anxiety as they grow up. In fact, 71.4% of LGBT folk experience major depression disorder (MDD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweet|first1=Matt|title=Depression and Anxiety in LGBT People: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.mattsweet.com/lgbt-anxiety-depression-guide.pdf|accessdate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For LGBT individuals, MDD can be caused by any of the following: self-esteem, pressure to conform, minority stress, coming out, family rejection, parenting, relationship formation, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sweet|first1=Matt|title=Depression and Anxiety in the LGBT People: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.mattsweet.com/lgbt-anxiety-depression-guide.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-esteem and pressure to conform go hand in hand. When an LGBT individual is told what to look like and who to love, it puts a toll on their self-esteem. When people make comments about who they are, what they look like, who they love, etc. it begins to make them feel insecure. It makes them feel as though they aren't good enough the way they are. "Coming-out" is a terms that is used to describe when an LGBT individual makes it known that they are gay, lesbian, etc. Coming out is usually the first factor that will affect a person involved in the LGBT community because when they first discover who they really are, their instinct is to confide in their parents to help them through it (Markheim, Personal Interview). When they experience family rejection after coming out, they automatically feel unwanted and unloved. This can set them into a downward spiral of depression. Parenting and relationship formation are very closely related because usually, people feel more comfortable parenting with their significant other rather than alone, especially if they are involved in the LGBT community. Just recently, in March 2016, is became legal for LGBT parents to adopt in all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Reilly|first1=Mollie|title=Same-Sex Couples Can Now Adopt Children in All 50 States|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mississippi-same-sex-adoption_us_56fdb1a3e4b083f5c607567f|newspaper=Huffington Post|accessdate=July 18, 2017|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not being able to conceive their own child can already cause depression, but when they were denied the right to adopt, it caused even more pain. Minority stress is not the biggest of all the factors, but it doesn't make anybody feel better. Minority stress is defined as a stress experienced by LGBT individuals due to their sexual orientation/gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Ilan|title=Minority Stress and Mental Health in Gay Men|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|date=March 1995|volume= 36|issue= 1|page=38 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15461517|accessdate=July 24, 2017|doi=10.2307/2137286|jstor=2137286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence can slip anybody into a depressed state whether the violence is a type of physical abuse, mental abuse, or verbal abuse. A person can be harassed to the point where their depression becomes to much and they no longer experience any happiness. These factors all work together and make it extremely hard to avoid MDD.

== Effects of queer bullying ==

Queer bullying may make some victims feel sad and unsafe in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glew | first1 = G.

Some victims might feel paralyzed and withdraw socially as a coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="Crozier" /&gt; Other victims of queer bullying may begin to live the effects of [[learned helplessness]].&lt;ref name="Roth" /&gt; Queer or [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] students may try to pass as heterosexual in order to avoid queer bullying. [[Passing (sexual orientation)|Passing]] isolates the student from other queer or questioning students, potential [[Straight ally|allies]], and support.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Adults who try to pass also may feel the effects emotionally and psychologically, of this effort to conceal their true identities.&lt;ref name="Herek" /&gt;

== Explicit and implicit homophobic and transphobic discriminatory behavior in educational settings ==

Homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings can be categorized as explicit and implicit. Explicit homophobic and transphobic violence consists of overt acts that make subjects feel uncomfortable, hurt, humiliated or intimidated. Peers and educational staff are unlikely to intervene when witnessing these incidents. This contributes to normalizing such acts that become accepted as either a routine disciplinary measure or a means to resolve conflicts among students. Homophobic and transphobic violence – as with all school-related gender-based violence – is acutely underreported due to subjects’ fear of retribution, combined with inadequate or non-existent reporting, support and redress systems.&lt;ref&gt;GMR, UNESCO, and UNGEI, ‘School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all: Policy Paper 17 at 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in New York City’, 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in New York City.

Implicit homophobic and transphobic violence, sometimes called ‘symbolic violence’ or ‘institutional’ violence, is subtler than explicit violence. It consists of pervasive representations or attitudes that sometimes feel harmless or natural to the school community, but that allow or encourage homophobia and transphobia, including perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Policies and guidelines can reinforce or embed these representations or attitudes, whether in an individual institution or across an entire education sector. This way, they can become part of everyday practices and rules guiding school behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;ICGBV, ‘Addressing School Related Gender Based Violence: Learning from Practice: Learning Brief No. 10’, Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence, Dublin, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Leach, M. Dunne, and F. Salvi, ‘School-Related Gender based Violence: A global review of current issues and approaches in policy, programming and implementation responses to School-Related Gender-Based Violence (SRGBV) for the Education Sector’, UNESCO, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Examples of implicit homophobic and transphobic violence include:

* Asserting that some subjects are better suited to students based on their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression (for example, science for heterosexual male students and drama for gay male students).
* Suggesting that it is normal for heterosexual students to have greater agency or influence (for example, with the opinions of LGBTI students treated as marginal and unimportant).
* Reinforcing stereotypes related to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression in curriculum materials or teacher training, such as through images and discourse (for example, that refer to heterosexuality as ‘normal’).
* Reinforcing stereotypes related to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression in educational policies, rules and regulations (for example, by not even acknowledging that LGBTI students are part of the school community and by not specifying them in relevant policies).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Statistics and examples ==

Teens face harassment, threats, and violence. A 1998 study in the US by [[Mental Health America]] found that students heard anti-gay slurs such as "homo", "faggot" and "sissy" about 26 times a day on average, or once every 14 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health American, Bullying and Gay Youth |url=http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth |publisher=National Mental Health Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414144851/http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-health/bullying-and-gay-youth |archivedate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, a union for UK professionals, the word "gay" was reported to be the most popular term of abuse heard by teachers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=How 'gay' Became Children's Insult of Choice|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7289390.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About two-thirds of gay and lesbian students in [[Great Britain|British]] schools have suffered from gay bullying in 2007, according to a study done by the [[Schools Education Unit]] for [[LGBT|LGB]] activist group [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]]. Almost all that had been bullied had experienced verbal attacks, 41 percent had been physically attacked, and 17 percent had received death threats. It also showed that over 50% of teachers did not respond to homophobic language which they had explicitly heard in the classroom, and only 25% of schools had told their students that homophobic bullying was wrong, showing "a shocking picture of the extent of homophobic bullying undertaken by fellow pupils and, alarmingly, school staff",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Gay Bullying in Schools Common|date=June 26, 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6239098.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with further studies conducted by the same charity in 2012 stated that 90% of teachers had had no training on the prevention of homophobic bullying. However, Ofsted's new 2012 framework did ask schools what they would be doing in order to combat the issue.&lt;ref name=Stonewall1&gt;{{cite web|title=Homophobic bullying|url=http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_school/education_for_all/secondary_schools/homophobic_bullying/default.asp|website=stonewall.org.uk|publisher=Stonewall |accessdate=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of [[Illinois]] passed a law (SB3266) in June 2010 that prohibits gay bullying and other forms of bullying in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SB3266 Text |url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=76&amp;GA=96&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;DocNum=3266&amp;GAID=10&amp;LegID=51081&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311201259/http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=76&amp;GA=96&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;DocNum=3266&amp;GAID=10&amp;LegID=51081&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= |archivedate=March 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]], legislators implemented Republic Act No. 10627, otherwise known as the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013, in schools. According to the said law, gender-based bullying is defined as ˮany act that humiliates or excludes a person on the basis of perceived or actual sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI)ˮ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 10627|url=http://www.gov.ph/2013/12/13/implementing-rules-and-regulations-of-republic-act-no-10627/|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher=Government of the Philippines|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{News release|date=May 2012}}
'''Greenhouse debt''' is the measure to which an individual person, incorporated association, business enterprise, government instrumentality or / [and] (per Neb., USA) geographic community exceeds its permitted [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse]] [[ecological footprint|footprint]] and contributes [[greenhouse gas]]es that contribute to [[global warming]] and [[climate change]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The concept makes no sense without a clear numerical value for the permitted [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse]] [[ecological footprint|footprint]]. It is not clear what this value is.

[[Friends of the Earth]] and similar organisations put forward the concept to define specifically the environmental harm caused by developed countries' past and present policies.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth International. 2000. "Greenhouse debt".  ''Link'' (20):  http://www.foei.org/en/publications/link/92/e92greenhouse_debt.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments, at least the Australian [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] leadership, have a tendency to accept such a line of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Hamilton, "We will all pay for Howard's hidden greenhouse debt", Crikey, Friday, 14 December 2007: http://www.crikey.com.au/Politics/20071214-Howards-Hidden-Greenhouse-Debt-.html?CurrentDate=14+%2F+01+%2F+2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The greenhouse debt assessment thus forms an [[ecological footprint]] analysis but can be used separately. Taken conjointly with a 'water debt' [[needs assessment|analysis]] and an [[environmental impact assessment|ecological impact assessment]], greenhouse debt analysis is basic to giving individuals, organisations, governments and communities an understanding of the effects they are having on [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]], [[life]], and [[global warming]].  

Ensuring that the greenhouse debt is zero is essential towards achieving [[ecologically sustainable development]] or a [[sustainable retreat]]. Any greenhouse debt incurred will contribute to making life harder for future generations of humans and [[non-human]] lifeforms.

There are three possible consequences that occur as a result of a greenhouse debt.

#''[[Mitigation of global warming|Mitigation]]:'' finding compensatory ways of reducing the greenhouse debt so its effects are neutralised
#''[[Adaptation]]:'' finding ways of adjusting to the resulting global warming or climate change
#''[[Suffering]]:'' having one's quality of life reduced as a result of the consequences

The '''halo effect''' is a type of immediate judgement discrepancy, or [[cognitive bias]], where a person making an initial assessment of another person, place, or thing will assume ambiguous information based upon [[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thinking, fast and slow|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux|year=2013|isbn=978-0-374-53355-7|edition=1st |location=New York|pages=82–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Halo Effect and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers|last=Rosenzweig|first=Philip M.|publisher=Free Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4767-8403-8|location=New York, NY|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lachman|first=Sheldon J.|last2=Bass|first2=Alan R.|date=November 1985|title=A Direct Study of Halo Effect|url=|journal=Journal of Psychology|volume=119 |issue=6|pages=535–540|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simplified example of the halo effect is when an individual noticing that the person in the photograph is attractive, well groomed, and properly attired, assumes, using a mental [[heuristic]], that the person in the photograph is a good person based upon the rules of that individual's social concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thorndike|first=E.L.|date=1920|title=A constant error in psychological ratings.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/apl/4/1/25|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=25–29|doi=10.1037/h0071663|issn=0021-9010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nisbett|first=Richard E.|last2=Wilson|first2=Timothy D.|date=1977|title=The halo effect: Evidence for unconscious alteration of judgments.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/35/4/250|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=250–256|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.4.250|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Jeremy L.|last2=Gore|first2=Jonathan S.|date=2016-12-01|title=Is He a Hero or a Weirdo?

The halo effect can also be explained as the behavior (usually unconscious) of using evaluations based on things unrelated, to make judgments about something or someone. The halo effect specifically refers to when this behavior has a positive correlation, such as viewing someone who is attractive as likely to be successful and popular. When this judgement has a negative connotation, such as someone unattractive being more readily blamed for a crime than someone attractive, it is referred to as the [[horn effect]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sigall|first=Harold|last2=Ostrove|first2=Nancy|date=1975-03-01|title=Beautiful but Dangerous: Effects of Offender Attractiveness and Nature of the Crime on Juridic Judgment|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232451231|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=31|issue=3|pages=410–414|doi=10.1037/h0076472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The halo effect was named by psychologist [[Edward Thorndike]] in reference to a person being perceived as having a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]. He gave the phenomenon its name in his 1920 article [[#CITEREFThorndike1920|"A Constant Error in Psychological Ratings"]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1920-10104-014|title=PsycNET|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Constant Error", Thorndike set out to replicate the study in hopes of pinning down the bias that he thought was present in these ratings. Subsequent researchers have studied it in relation to [[attractiveness]] and its bearing on the judicial and educational systems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thorndike originally coined the term referring only to people; however, its use has been greatly expanded especially in the area of brand marketing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Supporting evidence===
In "A Constant Error in Psychological Ratings", Thorndike asked two commanding officers to evaluate their soldiers in terms of physical qualities (neatness, voice, [[physical attractiveness|physique]], bearing, and energy), intellect, leadership skills, and personal qualities (including dependability, loyalty, responsibility, selflessness, and cooperation).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His goal was to see how the ratings of one characteristic affected other characteristics.

Thorndike's study showed how there was too great a [[Correlation (statistics)|correlation]] in the commanding officers' responses. In his review he stated: "The correlations are too high and too even. For example, for the three raters next studied[,] the average correlation for physique with intelligence is .31; for physique with leadership, .39; and for physique with character, .28".{{Sfnp | Thorndike | 1920 | p = 27}}  The ratings of one of the special qualities of an officer often started a trend in the rating results. If an officer had a particular "negative" attribute given off to the commanding officer, it would correlate in the rest of that soldier's results.

==Cognitive bias==
[[File:Fried Rosenstock L’Artista Santo.jpg|thumb]]
The term "halo" is used in analogy with the religious concept: a glowing circle crowning the heads of saints in countless medieval and Renaissance paintings, bathing the saint's face in heavenly light. The observer may be subject to overestimating the worth of the observed by the presence of a quality that adds light on the whole like a halo. In other words, observers tend to bend their judgement according to one patent characteristic of the person (the "halo"), generalizing towards a judgement of that person's character (e.g., in the literal hagiologic case, "entirely good and worthy").

The effect works in both positive and negative directions (and is hence sometimes called the [[Bias#Horn effect|horns and halo effect]]). If the observer likes one aspect of something, they will have a positive predisposition toward everything about it. If the observer dislikes one aspect of something, they will have a negative predisposition toward everything about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Horns and halo effect|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/horns+and+halo+effect|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of attractiveness==
A person's attractiveness has also been found to produce a halo effect. Attractiveness provides a valuable aspect of the halo effect to consider because of its multifaceted nature; attractiveness may be influenced by several specific traits.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Halo Effect|last=LeClaire|first=Anne|publisher=Lake Union Publishing|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These perceptions of attractiveness may affect judgments tied to personality traits. Physical attributes contribute to perceptions of attractiveness (e.g., weight, hair, eye color). For example, someone who is perceived as attractive, due in part to physical traits, may be more likely to be perceived as kind or intelligent. The role of attractiveness in producing the halo effect has been illustrated through a number of studies. Recent research, for example, has revealed that attractiveness may affect perceptions tied to life success and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1023/A:1023582629538|title=Weight Halo Effects: Individual Differences in Perceived Life Success as a Function of Women's Race and Weight|year= 2003|last1= Wade | first1 = T Joel|last2=DiMaria|first2=Cristina |journal=Sex Roles|volume=48|issue=9/10|pages=461–465}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, attractiveness was correlated with weight, indicating that attractiveness itself may be influenced by various specific traits.  Included in the personality variables were trustworthiness and friendliness.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; People perceived as being more attractive were more likely to be perceived as trustworthy and friendly.  What this suggests is that perceptions of attractiveness may influence a variety of other traits, which supports the concept of the halo effect.

===On personality===
{{Harvtxt | Dion | Berscheid | Walster | 1972}} conducted a study on the relationship between attractiveness and the halo effect. Sixty students, thirty male and thirty female) from the [[University of Minnesota]] took part in the experiment. Each subject was given three different photos to examine: one of an attractive individual, one of an individual of average attractiveness, and one of an unattractive individual.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Jean-Claude|date=|title=2010|url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1990/A1990EH31100001.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants judged the photos' subjects along 27 different personality traits (including altruism, conventionality, self-assertiveness, stability, emotionality, trustworthiness, [[extraversion]], kindness, and sexual promiscuity). Participants were then asked to predict the overall happiness the photos' subjects would feel for the rest of their lives, including marital happiness (least likely to get divorced), parental happiness (most likely to be a good parent), social and professional happiness (most likely to experience life fulfillment), and overall happiness. Finally, participants were asked if the subjects would hold a job of high status, medium status, or low status.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Results showed that most of the participants overwhelmingly believed more attractive subjects have more socially desirable personality traits than either averagely attractive or unattractive subjects. Participants also believed that attractive individuals would lead happier lives in general, have happier marriages, and have more career success than the others. Also, results showed that attractive people were believed to be more likely to hold secure, prestigious jobs compared to unattractive individuals. Participants however believed that attractive individuals would be worse parents than both average attractive and unattractive individuals.

===Academics and intelligence===
A study by {{harvtxt|Landy|Sigall|1974}} demonstrated the Halo Effect, looking at judgments of intelligence and competence on academic tasks. Sixty male undergraduate students rated the quality of essays which included both well and poorly written samples. One third were presented with a photo of an attractive female as author, another third with that of an unattractive female as author, and the last third were shown neither. In average most of the participants gave significantly better writing evaluations for the more attractive author. On a scale of 1 to 9, the well-written essay by the attractive author received an average of 6.7 while the unattractive author received a 5.9 (with a 6.6 as a control). The gap was larger on the poor essay: the attractive author received an average of 5.2, the control a 4.7, and the unattractive a 2.7, suggesting readers are generally more willing to give physically attractive people the benefit of the doubt when performance is below standard than others.

Research conducted by Moore, Filippou, &amp; Perrett (2011),&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=F. R.|last2=Filippou|first2=D.|last3=Perrett|first3=D. I.|date=2011-09|title=Intelligence and attractiveness in the face: Beyond the attractiveness halo effect|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Psychology|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=205–217|doi=10.1556/jep.9.2011.3.2|issn=1789-2082}}&lt;/ref&gt; sought residual cues to [[intelligence]] in female and male faces while attempting to control for the [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]] halo effect. Over 300 photographs of Caucasian British college students were rated for perceived intelligence. The photographs that were scored lowest in low perceived intelligence were used to create a low-intelligence composite face and those photographs that were scored highest for high perceived intelligence were used to create a high-intelligence composite face. Both female and male, of high- and low- perceived intelligence were created resulting in four groups of composite faces. Participants for the study were recruited online; 164 female and 92 male [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] residents of the UK rated each of the composite faces for intelligence and attractiveness. Of the female composites, attractiveness seemed to be controlled as both the high- and low- perceived intelligence groups were rated as equally attractive. However, of the male face composites, the high-perceived intelligence group was rated as significantly more attractive than the low-perceived intelligence group, suggesting that either the authors could not adequately control for the attractiveness halo effect for the male composite photographs or that intelligence is an integral factor of attractiveness in high intelligent male faces. The second part of the study found that the composites in the high-perceived intelligence group were rated highest in the factors of friendly and funny as markers of intelligence in both the female and male group. While intelligence does not seem to be a factor that contributes to attractiveness in women, with regards to men, attractive faces are perceived to be more intelligent, friendly, and funny by women and men.

===Political effects===
A study by {{Harvtxt | Verhulst | Lodge | Lavine | 2010}} found that attractiveness and familiarity are strong predictors of decisions regarding who is put in a position of leadership.  Judgments made following one-second exposures to side-by-side photos of two US congressional candidates were reasonably predictive of election outcomes. Attractiveness and familiarity were correlated with competence in this study. Candidates who appeared more attractive and familiar were also seen as more competent and were found more likely to be elected.  Similar studies {{Harv | Palmer | Peterson | 2012}} found that even when taking factual knowledge into account, candidates who were rated as more attractive were still perceived as more knowledgeable.  These results suggest that the halo effect greatly impacts how individuals perceive political knowledge and it demonstrates the powerful influence of the halo effect in politics.

===The judicial context===
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
Study results showing the influence of the halo effect in the judicial context exist:

*{{Harvtxt | Efran | 1974}} found subjects were more lenient when sentencing attractive individuals than unattractive ones, even though exactly the same crime was committed. The researchers attributed the result to a societal perception that people with a high level of attractiveness are seen as more likely to have successful futures due to corresponding socially desirable traits.
*{{Harvtxt | Monahan | 1941}} studied social workers who were accustomed to interacting with a diverse range of people and found that the majority experienced difficulty when asked to consider that a beautiful person was guilty of a crime.
*A study presented two hypothetical crimes: a [[burglary]] and a [[confidence trick|swindle]]. The burglary involved a woman illegally obtaining a key and stealing $2,200; the swindle involved a woman manipulating a man to invest $2,200 in a nonexistent corporation.  The results showed that when the offense was not related to attractiveness (as in the burglary) the unattractive defendant was punished more severely than the attractive one. However, when the offense was related to attractiveness (the swindle), the attractive defendant was punished more severely than the unattractive one.  The study imputes that the usual leniency given to the attractive woman (as a result of the halo effect) was negated or reversed when the nature of the crime involved her looks.&lt;ref name="ostrove_sigall1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ostrove|first1=Nancy|last2=Sigall|first2=Harold|year=1975|title=Beautiful but Dangerous: Effects of Offender Attractiveness and Nature of the Crime on Juridic Judgment|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harold_Sigall/publication/232451231_Beautiful_but_dangerous_Effects_of_offender_attractiveness_and_nature_of_crime_on_juridic_judgment/links/542b0bab0cf29bbc126a7dbc.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=31|issue=3|pages=410–14|doi=10.1037/h0076472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender differences===
A study by {{harvtxt|Kaplan|1978}} yielded much of the same results as are seen in other studies focusing on the halo effect—attractive individuals were rated more highly in qualities such as creativity, intelligence, and sensitivity than unattractive individuals. However, in addition to these results Kaplan found that some women were influenced by the halo effect on attractiveness only when presented with members of the opposite sex. When presented with an attractive member of the same sex, the effect was attenuated for some women. {{harvtxt|Dermer|Thiel|1975}} continue this line of research, going on to demonstrate that jealousy of an attractive individual has slight effect in evaluation of that person. Their work shows this to be more prevalent among females than males, with some females being less influenced by the halo effect. Later research by Moore, Filippou, &amp; Perrett (2011)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; was able to control for attractiveness in composite photographs of females who were perceived to be of high or low intelligence, while showing that the attractiveness halo effect was seen in high intelligent male composite faces by heterosexual residents of the UK. Either the halo effect is negated by feelings of jealousy in women&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; or the halo effect is lessened when women are looking at same sex individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert M.|date=1978-04-01|title=Is beauty talent? Sex interaction in the attractiveness halo effect|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=195–204|doi=10.1007/BF00287500|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the attractiveness halo effect can be controlled for in women&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; it appears that there is a difference in affect produced by the attractiveness halo effect at least between binary genders.

===Possible cause===

{{harvtxt|Kanazawa|Kovarb|2004}} have reasoned that if the following four assumptions were true, beautiful people are indeed likely to be more intelligent and provided empirical evidence for these assumptions.
# More intelligent men are more likely to attain higher status. 
# Higher-status men are more likely to mate with more beautiful women. 
# Intelligence is heritable. 
# Beauty is heritable.

==The reverse halo effect==
The reverse halo effect occurs when positive evaluations of an individual cause negative consequences. Dermer and Thiel (1975) had female undergraduates rate pictures of highly attractive, moderately attractive, and unattractive females and evaluate them on a number of dimensions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dermer|first1=Marshall|last2=Thiel|first2=Darrel|title=When Beauty May Fail|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1975|volume=31|issue=6|pages=1168–1176|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.552.3491&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=21 October 2017|doi=10.1037/h0077085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their hypothesis that jealousy would moderate attractiveness ratings was partially supported. Unattractive raters did not rate attractive females as highly, and thought that they would be less competent parents and more likely to cheat. A follow up study with both men and women participants supported this, as well as showing that attractive women were expected to be conceited and have a higher socioeconomic status. Eagly et al. (1991) also commented on this phenomenon, showing that more attractive individuals of all sexes were expected to be higher in vanity and possibly egotistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eagly|first1=Alice H.|last2=Ashmore|first2=R.D.|last3=Makhijani|first3=M.G.|last4=Longo|first4=L.C.|title=What is Beautiful is Good, But...

==The horn effect==
The [[horn effect]] occurs when people allow an undesirable trait to influence their evaluation of other traits.&lt;ref name=nisbett&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nisbett | first1 = Richard E | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Timothy D | year= 1977 |title= The halo effect: Evidence for unconscious alteration of judgments |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume =35 |issue=4 |pages=250–56 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.4.250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote of the devil effect in relation to [[Hugo Chavez]]: "Some leaders can become so demonized that it's impossible to assess their achievements and failures in a balanced way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Glennie|first=Jonathan|title=Hugo Chávez's reverse-halo effect|url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/03/hugo-chavez-reverso-halo-effect |newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When someone is seen in a negative light, anything they do that is negative is exemplified, while the positive things they do are not seen, or are doubted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Education==
{{harvtxt|Abikoff|Courtney | Pelham | Koplewicz |1993}} found the halo effect is also present in the classroom. In this study, both regular and [[special education]] elementary school teachers watched videotapes of what they believed to be children in regular 4th-grade classrooms. In reality, the children were actors, depicting behaviors present in [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), or standard behavior. The teachers were asked to rate the frequency of hyperactive behaviors observed in the children. Teachers rated hyperactive behaviors accurately for children with ADHD; however, the ratings of hyperactivity were much higher for the children with ODD-like behaviors, showing a halo effect for children with ODD.

{{Harvtxt | Foster | Ysseldyke | 1976}} also found the halo effect present in teachers' evaluations of children. Regular and special education elementary school teachers watched videos of a normal child whom they were told was either emotionally disturbed, possessing a learning disorder, mentally retarded, or "normal". The teachers then completed referral forms based on the child's behavior. The results showed that teachers held negative expectancies toward emotionally disturbed children, maintaining these expectancies even when presented with normal behavior. In addition, the mentally retarded label showed a greater degree of negative bias than the emotionally disturbed or learning disabled.

===Observations===

"In the classroom, teachers are subject to the halo effect rating error when evaluating their students. For example, a teacher who sees a well-behaved student might tend to assume this student is also bright, diligent, and engaged before that teacher has objectively evaluated the student's capacity in these areas. When these types of halo effects occur, they can affect students' approval ratings in certain areas of functioning and can even affect students' grades."
(Rasmussen, Encyclopedia of Educational Psychology, Volume 1, 2008)

"In the work setting, the halo effect is most likely to show up in a supervisor's appraisal of a subordinate's [[job performance]]. In fact, the halo effect is probably the most common bias in [[performance appraisal]]. Think about what happens when a supervisor evaluates the performance of a subordinate. The supervisor may give prominence to a single characteristic of the employee, such as enthusiasm, and allow the entire evaluation to be colored by how he or she judges the employee on that one characteristic. Even though the employee may lack the requisite knowledge or ability to perform the job successfully, if the employee's work shows enthusiasm, the supervisor may very well give him or her a higher performance rating than is justified by knowledge or ability."
(Schneider, F.W., Gruman, J. A., &amp; Coutts, L. M., Applied Social Psychology, 2012)

==Branding==
The term halo effect is used in [[marketing]] to explain customer bias toward certain products because of favorable experience with other products made by the same company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/halo-effect.asp|title=Halo Effect|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2008-10-27|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The halo effect is also present in the field of [[brand marketing]]. One common halo effect is when the perceived positive features of a particular item extend to a broader brand. A notable example is the manner in which the popularity of Apple's [[iPod]] generated enthusiasm for the corporation's other products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple shares surfs on big profits|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4172211.stm |accessdate=18 January 2012|newspaper= BBC News|date= 13 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A halo effect with regard to health, dubbed a "health halo", is used in [[food marketing]] to increase sales of a product; it can result in increased consumption of the product in the halo which may be unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Provencher|first1=V|last2=Jacob|first2=R|title=Impact of Perceived Healthiness of Food on Food Choices and Intake|journal=Current Obesity Reports|date=March 2016|volume=5|issue=1|pages=65–71|doi=10.1007/s13679-016-0192-0|pmid=26820622|hdl=20.500.11794/13474}} [https://corpus.ulaval.ca/jspui/bitstream/20.500.11794/13474/1/Provencher%20V%20-%20Current%20Obesity%20Reports%202015.pdf Open access preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polivy|first1=J|title=What's that you're eating?

The term "halo effect" has also been applied to [[human rights organization]]s that have used their status to move away from their stated goals. Political scientist [[Gerald Steinberg]] has claimed that [[NGO|non-governmental organizations (NGOs)]] take advantage of the halo effect and are "given the status of impartial moral watchdogs" by governments and the [[news media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Jeffray|first = Nathan |title=Interview: Gerald Steinberg|url = http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/33415/interview-gerald-steinberg |newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle|date=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Balanson| first = Naftali | title= The 'halo effect' shields NGOs from media scrutiny|url= http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=110648 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ronald McDonald House, a widely known NGO, openly celebrates the positive outcomes it receives from the halo effect. The web page for the Ronald McDonald House in Durham, North Carolina, states that 95% of survey participants were aware of Ronald McDonald House Charities. This awareness is attributed to the halo effect, as employees, customers, and stakeholders are more likely to be involved in a charity that they recognize and trust, with a name and logo that are familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ronaldhousedurham.org/page/corporate-donors|last = Jones |first= Nancy|title= Corporate Donors| publisher = Ronald House Durham | accessdate= 26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A brand's halo effect can protect its reputation in the event of a crisis. An event that is detrimental to a brand that is viewed favorably would not be as threatening or damaging to a brand that consumers view unfavorably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Coombs|first1 =Timothy W | last2  = Holladay | first2 =Sherry J|journal=Journal of Communication Management|year=2006|volume=10|issue= 2|pages = 123–37 |doi=10.1108/13632540610664698 |title=Unpacking the halo effect: reputation and crisis management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Klein|first1 =Jill| first2 = Niraj | last2 = Dawar|title= Evaluations in a Product-Harm Crisis| journal= International Journal of Research in Marketing | year= 2004|volume=21|issue=3|pages=203–17|doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2003.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other use==
===Non-psychology/business use===
Non-psychology/business use of the term "halo effect" can refer to the monetary value of expenditures either in subsequent time periods.&lt;ref&gt;1966,"The Marketing Game" - a textbook and a software package. They referred to the future monetary value of a marketing expenditure that has subsequently been reduced as "Halo effect."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Halo effect on the dead ==
Often, a person's character is perceived in a more positive light after their death. An example of this is what took place after [[Michael Jackson]] died in 2009. Before Jackson's death, he was only a few years removed from accusations of sexual molestation of minors. The public deemed him a "child molester" and "sex offender". However, since his death discussion of sexual misconduct has subsided and public perception mainly focuses on his success and status as the King of Pop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/natural-history-the-modern-mind/200907/the-halo-effect-in-overdrive|title=The Halo Effect in Overdrive|last=Goetz|first=Andrew|date=7/2/2009|website=Psychology Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=this needs more academic sourcing|date=June 2018}}

==Further research findings==
{{harvtxt|Murphy|Jako|Anhalt|1993}} argue: "Since 1980, there have been a large number of studies dealing directly or indirectly with halo error in rating. Taken together, these studies suggest that all seven of the characteristics that have defined halo error for much of its history are problematic and that the assumptions that underlie some of them are demonstrably wrong." Their work claims that the assumption that the halo effect is always detrimental is incorrect, with some halo effects resulting in an increase in the accuracy of the rating, in their opinion. Additionally, they discuss the idea of "true halo"—the actual correlation between, for example, attractiveness and performance as an instructor—and "illusory halo" that refers to cognitive distortions, errors in observation and judgement, and the rating tendencies of the individual rater. They claim that any true differentiation between true and illusory halos is impossible in a real-world setting, because the different ratings are strongly influenced by the specific behaviors of the person observed by the raters.

A study by {{harvtxt|Forgas|2011}} states that one's mood can affect the degree of the halo effect's influence. When someone is in a favorable mood, the halo effect is more likely to be influential—this was demonstrated by study participants choosing between pictures of an elderly man with a beard and a young woman, and deciding which subject possessed more philosophical attributes. Additionally, when asked to list the happy times in their life, the halo effect was more evident in the perceptions of the participants. Forgas's study suggests that when one is gauging the extent of the halo effect in a situation, one must consider the emotional state of the person making the judgment.

The '''Karl May Museum''' is a museum in [[Radebeul]], Germany named after the German author [[Karl May]], containing artifacts from May's life as well as from life on the [[American frontier]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] life of that era.

==Museum history==
German author [[Karl May]] (1842–1912), wrote many books about the [[American frontier]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] featuring the fictional characters [[Winnetou]] (a Mescalero-Apache Chief) and [[Old Shatterhand]] (a white European settler). Mays' books were popular in Germany and created a mystique about the "Wild West" in German popular culture.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  

The museum opened in 1928 in [[Radebeul]], in the house where May had lived, called Villa Shatterhand.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;  It was founded during a peak of interest in the US frontier and native Americans, fostered in part by the [[Sarrasani]] circus, which was headquartered in nearby [[Dresden]], and which was very popular in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weaver|first1=Jace|title=Other Words: American Indian Literature, Law, and Culture|date=2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806133522|language=en|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQj_aQhYvfEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}} Sarassani and Native American members of the circus came to the opening, and the Native Americans performed death songs for May.&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;{{rp|84}}  

The museum was founded by May's widow and an eccentric Austrian named [[:de:Patty Frank|Ernst Tobis]], who was a fan of May's work and had travelled to the American frontier, and liked to tell [[tall tales]] about his time there.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Tobis donated a large collection of artifacts to help found the museum's collection, which included 17 [[Scalping|scalps]], some of them from Native Americans.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Knight2/&gt;

When the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] took over Germany, they appropriated the museum and the image of May, and were especially focused on swastikas that appeared in some of the Native American artwork.  Hitler Youth were encouraged to visit the museum and to hear stories from Tobis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penny|first1=H. Glenn|title=Kindred by Choice: Germans and American Indians Since 1800|date=2013|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9781469607641|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HV4DAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166|language=en|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the original museum was in [[East Germany]] and a replica was built in [[Bamburg]] in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;{{rp|73}} A person who called himself [[Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance]] became associated with the museum shortly after the war ended.&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;{{rp|84}} 

From 1956 to 1984, the museum in Radebul was called the "Indianer Museum", because May's books were suppressed by the East German government, in part because of the association with the Nazis, but also because the books were viewed as leading people to want to travel, which the government did not allow.&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galchen|first1=Rivka|title=Wild West Germany|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/09/wild-west-germany|work=The New Yorker|date=2 April 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Cold War]] placards in the museum in Radebeul and its displays were refactored to describe oppression of Native Americans by the US, as part of Soviet [[propaganda]] efforts to rally indigenous people against the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tóth|first1=György Ferenc|title=From Wounded Knee to Checkpoint Charlie: The Alliance for Sovereignty between American Indians and Central Europeans in the Late Cold War|date=2016|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9781438461236|pages=128ff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGwJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some East Germans also did work with the [[American Indian Movement]].&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

The museum in Radebul was given its original name again in 1986, as the East German government moved to reclaim May. The renaming led to an exhibition focused on May in February, which had 4,000 visitors a day, and people waited for three hours outside to get in.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;  After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, attendance at the Radebul museum dropped from around 300,000 people per year to around 60,000, as people could travel to the US instead of visiting the museum, which had been one of the only sources of information about Native Americans in East Germany.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt; 

In 2010, according to the ''South China Morning Post'', US activists began seeking [[repatriation]] of the scalps.&lt;ref name=SCMP&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1446600/karl-may-museum-under-fire-over-display-native-american-scalps | work= South China Morning Post | title= Karl May Museum under fire over display of Native American scalps |date= 11 March 2014 | accessdate= 3 May 2018 |quote= For four years, United States activists have been calling for the return of the scalps.

{{Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], '''Kashaya''' (loose translation: ''Passion'') are aspects of a person that can be gained during his or her worldly life. According to the Jaina religion as long as a person has Kashayas, they will not escape the cycle of life and death. There are four different kind of Kashayas, each being able to gain their own kinds of intensity.

== Overview ==
According to the Jain text, ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'', "He who has passions causes injury to himself by himself. Whether injury is then caused to other living beings or not, it is immaterial."{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=197}}

Spiritually, the goal of Jainism is to rid oneself of the worldly life and become free from the cycle of [[reincarnation]]. When one develop attachment or passions, this hinders the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] progress of their soul. Jainas believe that by reacting without passion and staying tranquil, one can break the cycle which forms more karma.

==The Four Kashayas==
{{further|Causes of Karma}}
The four ''kasaya'' are: ''krodha'' (anger), ''lobha'' (greed), ''mana'' (ego) and ''maya'' (deceit). Out of the many causes of bondage, emotions or passions are considered as the main cause of ''[[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]]'' or bondage. The [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }} p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The passions like anger, pride, deceit and greed are called sticky (''kaṣāyas'') because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in ''bandha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Reichenbach  | first =Bruce  | title =Karma, Causation, and Divine Intervention  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume =39  | issue =2  | pages =135–149  | publisher =University of Hawai press  | date =April 1989  | jstor =1399374| doi =10.2307/1399374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The karmic inflow on account of ''yoga'' driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Tatia | first = Nathmal | title =Tattvārtha Sūtra: That Which Is of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =Rowman Altamira | year =1994 | location =Lanham, MD | language =Sanskrit, English | isbn =0-7619-8993-5 }} p.152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kuhn | first =Hermann | title =Karma, The Mechanism : Create Your Own Fate | publisher =Crosswind Publishing | year =2001 | location =Wunstorf, Germany | isbn =3-9806211-4-6 }} p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the ancient Jain texts talk of subduing these negative emotions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Johnson | first =W.J. | title =Harmless souls: karmic bondage and religious change in early Jainism with special reference to Umāsvāti and Kundakunda | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publishers| year =1995 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1309-X }}  p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Negating kashayas can be done by remembering the opposites of kasahayas : Opposite of Krodha (Anger) is Kshama (Forgiveness). To avoid Krodha kashayas, one needs to remember to forgive. Opposite of lobha (greed) is Daan (Charity), one needs to remember to give away. Opposite of Mana(Ego)  is humility, one needs to be humble. Opposite of Deceit is honesty, one needs to be honest in all conditions to not get deceit kashayas. 

Most difficult Kashaya to overcome is Greed. 

When he wishes that which is good for him, he should get rid of the four faults—anger, pride, deceit and greed—which increase the evil. Anger and pride when not suppressed, and deceit and greed when arising: all these four black passions water the roots of re-birth.

—''Daśavaikālika sūtra, 8:36–39''

==Levels Of Intensity==
* Anantanubadh ('''Extremely Severe''') - This holds back one's ability to have correct beliefs/proper conduct.
* Apratyakhanavarana ('''Severe''') -  This holds back partial renunciation but does not affect true belief. While it is active, one cannot take partial vows.
* Pratyakhanavarana ('''Moderate''') - This holds back total renunciation, but does not affect correct belief and partial renunciation. While it is active, partial renunciation is possible, but monkhood is not.
* Sanjvalana ('''Slight'''): This holds back the attainment of total correct conduct, but does not affect right belief and monkhood. While it is active, initiation into monkhood and spiritual progress are possible, but becoming a [[vitragi]] is not.

The degrees of strength of the kasayas are illustrated by examples. The 4 species of anger are to be likened unto a line drawn in stone, in earth, in dust and in water. The first can only be removed with great effort, each following one always more easily. Likewise also, the lifelong enduring anger is only combated in its effect with exceeding strength and difficulty whilst the effect of the three remaining species accordingly diminishes in power and can, therefore, also more easily be destroyed. The degrees of pride are to be likened unto a pillar of stone, a bone, a piece of wood, and the vine of a creeper; the inflexibility correspondingly decreases. The species of deceitfulness are to be compared to a bamboo root, the horn of a ram, the urine of a cow, and a piece of wood. The crookedness of each of these is removed more easily than in the one preceding it. (The zig zag line of the cow's urine disappears through the influence of wind and weather.) The degrees of greed correspond to scarlet colour, to greater or smaller dirt, and to a spot of turmeric, which soil a garment: the scarlet is hardly removable, the dirt with more or less trouble, and the spot of turmeric can be removed with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Glasenapp | first =Helmuth Von | editor =H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17812">'''Land law''' is the form of [[law]] that deals with the [[rights]] to [[usufruct|use]], [[alienation (property law)|alienate]], or [[right to exclude|exclude]] others from [[wikt:land|land]]. In many jurisdictions, these kinds  of [[property]] are referred to as [[real estate]] or [[real property]], as distinct from [[personal property]]. [[Land use]] agreements, including [[renting]], are an important intersection of property and [[contract law]]. [[Encumbrance]] on the land rights of one, such as an [[easement]], may constitute the land rights of another. [[Mineral rights]] and [[water rights]] are closely linked, and often interrelated concepts.

Land rights are such a basic form of law that they develop even where there is no state to enforce them; for example, the [[claim club]]s of the [[American West]] were institutions that arose organically to enforce the system of rules appurtenant to mining. [[Squatting]], the occupation of land without ownership, is a globally ubiquitous phenomenon.

==National sovereignty==
[[Sovereignty]], in [[common law]] jurisdictions, is often referred to as [[absolute title]], [[radical title]], or [[allodial title]].  Nearly all of these jurisdictions have a system of [[land registration]], to record [[fee simple]] interests, and a [[land claim]] process to resolve disputes.

==Land rights==

[[Indigenous land rights]] are recognized by [[international law]], as well as the national legal systems of common law and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries. In common law jurisdictions, the land rights of [[indigenous peoples]] are referred to as [[aboriginal title]]. In [[customary law]] jurisdictions, [[customary land]] is the predominant form of land ownership.

[[Land reform]] refers to government policies that take and/or redistribute land, such as a [[land grant]].

Land rights refer to the inalienable ability of individuals to freely obtain, use, and possess land at their discretion, as long as their activities on the land do not impede on other individuals’ rights.&lt;ref name="Adi, D.N. 2009"&gt;Adi, D.N. (2009). Critical Mass Representation in Uganda. 1-38.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to be confused with access to land, which allows individuals the use of land in an economic sense (i.e. farming). Instead, land rights address the ownership of land which provides security and increases [[Capability approach|human capabilities]]. When a person only has access to land, they are in constant threat of expulsion depending on the choices of the land owner, which limits financial stability.&lt;ref name="Adi, D.N. 2009" /&gt;

Land rights are an integral part of Land Laws, as they socially enforce groups of individuals’ rights to own land in concurrence with the land laws of a nation. Land Law addresses the legal mandates set forth by a country in regards to land ownership, while land rights refer to the social acceptance of land ownership. [[Landesa]] takes the stance that although the law may advocate for equal access to land, land rights in certain countries and cultures may hinder a group’s right to actually own land.&lt;ref&gt;Hanstad, T. (2010). Secure Land Rights. Landesa.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws are important, but they must be backed up by cultural tradition and social acceptance. Therefore, laws concerning land ownership and land rights of a country must be in agreement.

Globally, there has been an increased focus on land rights, as they are so pertinent to various aspects of development. According to Wickeri and Kalhan, land ownership can be a critical source of capital, financial security, food, water, shelter, and resources.&lt;ref name=Wickeri-Kalhan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wickeri |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Kalhan |first2=Anil |title=Land Rights Issues in International Human Rights Law |journal=Malaysian Journal on Human Rights |date=2010 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |ssrn=1921447}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Global Land Tool organisation has found that rural landlessness is a strong predictor of poverty and hunger,&lt;ref&gt;Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (2009), Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons, 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; and negatively impacts [[Empowerment]] and the realisation of [[Human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;UN Global Land Tool Network (2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=2798&amp;catid=283&amp;typeid=24&amp;subMenuId=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111152637/http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=2798&amp;catid=283&amp;typeid=24&amp;subMenuId=0 |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to home in on this critical problem of inadequate land rights, The [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal 7D]] strives to improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Development Goal Monitor: Tracking the Mellennium Development Goals. (2010) http://www.mdgmonitor.org/goal7.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; This includes increased land rights for impoverished people, which will ultimately lead to a higher quality of life.&lt;ref name=Wickeri-Kalhan /&gt;

Although land rights are fundamental in achieving higher standards of living, certain groups of individuals are consistently left out of land ownership provisions. The law may provide access to land, however, cultural barriers and [[poverty trap]]s limit minority groups’ ability to own land.&lt;ref name="Hanstad, T. 2010"&gt;Hanstad, T. (2010). Secure Land Rights. Rural Development Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reach equality, these groups must obtain adequate land rights that are both socially and legally recognised.

==Land rights and women==
Several scholars argue that women’s lack of sufficient land rights negatively affects their immediate families and the larger community, as well.&lt;ref name="Hanstad, T. 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1988"&gt;Agarwal, B. (1988). “Who Sows? Who Reaps? Women and Land Rights in India” Journal of Peasant Studies. 531-581.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994"&gt;Agarwal, B. (1994). “A Field of One’s Own: Gender and Land Rights in South Asia”. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; With land ownership, women can develop an income and allocate this income more fairly within the household.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 2005"&gt;Agarwal, B. (2005). “Marital Violence, Human Development, and Women’s Property Status in India” World Development. 823-850.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deere, C.D. 2006"&gt;Deere, C.D., &amp; Doss, C. R. (2006). “Gender and the Distribution of Wealth in Developing Countries. World Institute for Development Economics Research, 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Hanstad]] claims that providing sufficient land rights for women is beneficial because, once women can exercise those rights the following will be promoted:&lt;ref&gt;Hanstad, T. (2010). Secure Land Rights. Rural Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt;
* Women will be less likely to contract and spread [[HIV/AIDS]] as they do not have to resort to prostitution
* Women will be less likely to be victims of [[Domestic violence]]
* Their children will be more likely to get an education and stay in school longer
* Women will be better positioned to get access to [[Microcredit]]

In many parts of the world, women have access to land in order to farm and cultivate the land; however, there are traditions and cultural norms which bar women from inheriting or purchasing land.&lt;ref name="Hanstad, T. 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deere, C.D. 2006" /&gt; This puts women in a place of dependence on their husbands, brothers, or fathers for their livelihood and shelter.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; Should there be an illness, domestic violence, or death in the family, women would be left landless and unable to either grow crops for food, or rent land for profit. Land ownership for women is a crucial form of security and income, increasing [[Empowerment]] and decreasing [[Poverty]].

===India===
Kanakalatha Mukund makes the important point that although women in [[India]] have the legal right to own land, very few actually do as a result of the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] practices which dominate the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Mukund, K. (1999). “Women's Property Rights in South India: A Review”. Economic and Political Weekly.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until recently, Indian women have been left out of laws regarding the distribution of public land and were forced to rely on the small possibility of obtaining private land from their families.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; [[Inheritance]] laws which cater towards men are one of the key issues behind inequality in land rights. According to [[Bina Agarwal]], land ownership defines social status and political power in the household and in the village, shaping relationships and creating family dynamics.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; Therefore, inheritance of land automatically puts men above women both in the household, and in the community. Without political pull in the village, and with limited bargaining powers within the household, women lack the voice to advocate for their own rights.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt;

Another issue with land rights in India is that they leave women completely dependent on the lives of their husbands. A study by Bina Agarwal found that in [[West Bengal]], prosperous families turn destitute when the male head of the household dies, as women are not permitted to take over their husband’s land.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; Also, due to cultural tradition, the higher the status of the woman, the less likely she is to have any developed skills that would be useful in finding work.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; These women are forced to beg for food and shelter once their husbands die because they have not been allowed to gain work experience.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt;

Bina Agarwal argues that land ownership significantly decreases the chance of domestic violence against Indian women.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 2005" /&gt; Owning property elevates women to a higher status within the household, allowing more equality and bargaining power. In addition, owning property separately from their husbands allowed women an opportunity of escape from [[Relational aggression|abusive relationships]].&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 2005" /&gt; Agarwal concluded that the prospect of a safe shelter outside of the main household decreases the longevity of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 2005" /&gt;

Land rights are critical for women in India due to the heavily patriarchal society in which they live. Cultural perspectives play a key role in the acceptance of equality within land ownership. Women owning land ultimately benefits the household and society as a whole.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1988" /&gt;

The most recent advance towards equality in land rights in India was the [[Hindu Succession Act, 1956|Hindu Succession Act of 2005]]. This act aimed to remove the gender discrimination which was present in the [[Hindu Succession Act, 1956]]. In the new amendment, daughters and sons have equal rights to obtain land from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu Succession Act 2005. September 5, 2005. http://www.hrln.org/admin/issue/subpdf/HSA_Amendment_2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This act was both a legally and socially important move for women’s rights to land ownership. Not only did it legally mandate equality in land succession, it also validated women’s roles as equals in society.

===Uganda===
[[Constitution of Uganda|Uganda’s 1995 Constitution]] enforces equality between men and women, including the acquisition and ownership of land.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Uganda. (1995). http://www.ugandaonlinelawlibrary.com/files/constitution/constitution_1995.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, research from Women’s Land Link Africa reveals that women remain excluded from land ownership due to customs and deeply ingrained cultural habits.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010"&gt;Women’s Land Link Africa. (2010). “The Impact of National Land Policy and Land Reform On Women in Uganda”. WLLA. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when women save up enough money to purchase land, the land is signed in their husband’s name, while women sign as the witness.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; [[Inheritance]] practices are a particular obstacle which reduces [[Empowerment|women empowerment]], as well. Land is passed down through male lineage which reinforces women’s exclusion from land ownership.&lt;ref name="cohre.org"&gt;Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions. (2010). “Uganda-Women’s Land Rights: The Gap Between Policy and Practice”. {{cite web |url=http://www.cohre.org/news/press-releases/uganda-women-s-land-rights-the-gap-between-policy-and-practice |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124010924/http://www.cohre.org/news/press-releases/uganda-women-s-land-rights-the-gap-between-policy-and-practice |archivedate=2011-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another detriment to equality, pointed out by Women’s Land Link Africa, is that women lack sufficient knowledge about the rights they have under the law to own land.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; Rural, illiterate women do not even have access to the new constitution which guarantees them land rights.

Although the 1995 Constitution provides for equality between men and women, there are still gaps in the law which affect women’s rights to land. The law protects the rights to land of wives in marriage; however, it does not address the needs of widows or divorcees.&lt;ref name="cohre.org" /&gt; Consequentially, these women are left landless and without the protection land offers. Also, women have a difficult time taking cases to court due to corruption and expensive trials.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; The trials concerning land take so long to process that many women do not even attempt to seek legal assistance.

Women’s Land Link Africa provides suggestions to alleviate inequality in land ownership. Rural women can be educated about their rights through radio campaigns, community discussions, educational outreach programs, and public forums.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; The cultural nuances must be addressed in policies and community leaders can be educated about inclusion of minority groups.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; Also, the law itself can address the rights of widows and divorcees in addition to the rights of married women.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt;

'''Love''' encompasses a variety of strong and positive emotional and mental states, ranging from the most sublime [[virtue]] or good habit, the deepest [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] [[affection]] and to the simplest [[pleasure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/love |title=Definition of Love in English |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |accessdate=May 1, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/love#translations |title=Definition of "Love" - English Dictionary |publisher=[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary|Cambridge English Dictionary]] |accessdate=May 1, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love of food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional [[attachment (psychology)|attachment]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;''Oxford Illustrated American Dictionary'' (1998) + ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Love can also be a [[virtue]] representing human [[kindness]], [[compassion]], and affection, as "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/love|title=Love - Definition of love by Merriam-Webster|website=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 1956"&gt;Fromm, Erich; ''The Art of Loving'', Harper Perennial (1956), Original English Version, {{ISBN|978-0-06-095828-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of [[interpersonal relationship]]s and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the [[creative arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article On Love |url=http://www.slideshare.net/azharabbas/just-love |accessdate=13 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530043739/http://www.slideshare.net/azharabbas/just-love |archivedate=30 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Love has been postulated to be a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to [[human reproduction|facilitate the continuation of the species]].&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;Helen Fisher. ''Why We Love: the nature and chemistry of romantic love''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Greek philosophers identified [[Greek words for love|five forms of love]]: essentially, [[familial love]] (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], ''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[Storge]]}}''), [[friendship|friendly love]] (''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[Philia]]}}''),  [[romance (love)|romantic love]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|[[Eros (concept)|Eros]]}}), [[hospitality|guest love]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|[[Xenia (Greek)|Xenia]]}}) and [[divine|divine love]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|[[Agape]]}}). Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: [[unrequited love]], [[limerence|infatuated love]], [[amour de soi|self-love]], and [[courtly love]]. Asian cultures have also distinguished ''{{lang|zh-Latn|[[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]]}}'', ''{{lang|sa-Latn|[[Kama]]}}'', ''{{lang|sa-Latn|[[Bhakti]]}}'', ''{{lang|sa-Latn|[[Mettā]]}}'', ''{{lang|ar-Latn|[[Ishq]]}}'', ''{{lang|he-Latn|[[Chesed]]}}'', and other [[Religious views on love|variants or symbioses of these states]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Liddell and Scott]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfili%2Fa φιλία]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gita"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mascaró |first=Juan |title=The Bhagavad Gita |publisher=Penguin|series=Penguin Classics |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-14-044918-1}} (J. Mascaró, translator)&lt;/ref&gt; Love has additional [[religion|religious]] or [[spiritual but not religious|spiritual]] meaning. This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states.

The word "love" can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Many other languages use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that in English are denoted as "love"; one example is the plurality of [[Greek words for love|Greek words for "love"]] which includes ''agape'' and ''eros''.&lt;ref&gt;Anders Nygren, ''Agape and Eros''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural identity|Cultural differences]] in conceptualizing love thus doubly impede the establishment of a universal definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kay|first=Paul|title=What is the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis?|journal=American Anthropologist|series=New Series|volume=86|issue=1|date=March 1984|pages=65–79|doi=10.1525/aa.1984.86.1.02a00050|last2=Kempton|first2=Willett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the nature or [[essence]] of love is a subject of frequent debate, different aspects of the word can be clarified by determining what ''isn't'' love (antonyms of "love"). Love as a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of ''like'') is commonly contrasted with [[hate]] (or neutral [[apathy]]). As a less sexual and more [[Emotional intimacy|emotionally intimate]] form of romantic attachment, love is commonly contrasted with [[lust]]. As an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is sometimes contrasted with [[friendship]], although the word ''love'' is often applied to close friendships or platonic love. (Further possible ambiguities come with usages "girlfriend", "boyfriend", "just good friends").

[[File:Columpio Veracruz 059.jpg|thumb|left|Fraternal love (Prehispanic sculpture from 250–900 AD, of [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]] origin). [[Museo de Antropología de Xalapa|Museum of Anthropology]] in [[Xalapa]], [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico]]]] Abstractly discussed ''love'' usually refers to an experience one person feels for another. Love often involves caring for, or identifying with, a person or thing (cf. [[vulnerability and care theory of love]]), including oneself (cf. [[narcissism]]). In addition to cross-cultural differences in understanding love, ideas about love have also changed greatly over time. Some historians date modern conceptions of romantic love to courtly Europe during or after [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], although the prior existence of romantic attachments is attested by ancient love poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The complex and abstract nature of love often reduces discourse of love to a [[thought-terminating cliché]]. Several common [[proverb]]s regard love, from [[Virgil]]'s "[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Love conquers all]]" to [[The Beatles]]' "[[All You Need Is Love]]". [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], following [[Aristotle]], defines love as "to will the good of another."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2026.htm#article4 |title=St. Thomas Aquinas, STh I-II, 26, 4, corp. art |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] describes love as a condition of "absolute value," as opposed to [[relative value (economics)|relative value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Rtpak6zyOmYC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=bertrand+russell+love+%22absolute+value%22#v=onepage&amp;q=bertrand%20russell%20love%20%22absolute%20value%22&amp;f=false|title=Love|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] said that love is "to be delighted by the happiness of another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Discourses''. Myrtle Beach: Sheriar Press. p. 113. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Jeremy Griffith]] defines love as "unconditional selflessness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtransformation.com/what-is-love/ ''What is love?''.

==Impersonal love==
People can be said to love an object, principle, or goal to which they are deeply committed and greatly value. For example, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' "love" of their cause may sometimes be born not of interpersonal love but impersonal love, [[altruism]], and strong spiritual or political convictions.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"&gt;Fromm, Erich; ''The Art of Loving'', Harper Perennial (5 September 2000), Original English Version, {{ISBN|978-0-06-095828-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can also "love" material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding or otherwise identifying with those things. If sexual passion is also involved, then this feeling is called [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DiscoveryHealth |first= |title=Paraphilia |url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/paraphilia.html |accessdate=16 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212105714/http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/paraphilia.html |archivedate=12 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Love of Life (disambiguation)|common]] principle that people say they love is [[life]] itself.

==Interpersonal love==
Interpersonal love refers to love between human beings. It is a much more potent sentiment than a simple ''liking'' for a person. [[Unrequited love]] refers to those feelings of love that are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with [[interpersonal relationships]].&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"/&gt; Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples. There are also a number of psychological disorders related to love, such as [[erotomania]].
[[File:Gothaer Liebespaar.jpg|thumb|180px|''Pair of Lovers''. 1480–1485]]
Throughout history, [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] have done the most speculation on the phenomenon of love. In the 20th century, the science of [[psychology]] has written a great deal on the subject. In recent years, the sciences of [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[biology]] have added to the understanding the concept of love.

===Biological basis===
{{Main|Biological basis of love}}
Biological models of sex tend to view love as a [[mammal]]ian drive, much like [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Thomas |author2=Amini, F. |author3=Lannon, R. | title = A General Theory of Love | publisher = Random House | year = 2000 |isbn=978-0-375-70922-7| title-link = A General Theory of Love }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], an anthropologist and human behavior researcher, divides the experience of love into three partly overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust is the feeling of [[sexual desire]]; romantic attraction determines what partners mates find attractive and pursue, conserving time and energy by choosing; and attachment involves sharing a home, parental duties, mutual defense, and in humans involves feelings of safety and security.&lt;ref name="brain systems"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/helenfisher/archives_of_sex_beh.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628051603/http://homepage.mac.com/helenfisher/archives_of_sex_beh.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2011 |df= }} Defining the Brain Systems of Lust, Romantic Attraction,
and Attachment by Fisher et. al&lt;/ref&gt; Three distinct neural circuitries, including neurotransmitters, and three behavioral patterns, are associated with these three romantic styles.&lt;ref name="brain systems" /&gt;

[[Lust]] is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes [[Mating (human)|mating]], and involves the increased release of chemicals such as [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months. [[Interpersonal attraction|Attraction]] is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. Recent studies in [[neuroscience]] have indicated that as people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including the [[neuroendocrine|neurotransmitter hormones]], [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]], the same compounds released by [[amphetamine]], stimulating the brain's [[pleasure center]] and leading to side effects such as increased [[heart rate]], loss of [[Anorexia (symptom)|appetite]] and [[insomnia|sleep]], and an [[euphoria|intense feeling of excitement]]. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half to three years.&lt;ref name="human"&gt;{{cite book

|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]
|isbn=978-0-03-093780-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships. [[Attachment theory|Attachment]] is the [[human bonding|bonding]] that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as [[marriage]] and [[children]], or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] to a greater degree than short-term relationships have.&lt;ref name="human"/&gt; [[Enzo Emanuele]] and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Emanuele, E.|author2=Polliti, P. |author3=Bianchi, M. |author4=Minoretti, P. |author5=Bertona, M. |author6= Geroldi, D.|year=2005|title=Raised plasma nerve growth factor levels associated with early-stage romantic love|url=http://www.biopsychiatry.com/lovengf.htm|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.09.002|volume= 31|pmid=16289361 |issue=3 |pages=288–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological basis===

[[File:Sri Lankan woman and child.jpg|thumb|Grandmother and grandchild in [[Sri Lanka]]]]
[[Psychology]] depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. [[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic or platonic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include any of these components. Liking only includes intimacy. Infatuated love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment. Romantic love includes both intimacy and passion. Companionate love includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and commitment. Lastly, consummate love includes all three components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sternberg| first= R. J. |year=1986| title=A triangular theory of love| journal=Psychological Review|volume= 93 |issue=2|pages= 119–135| doi=10.1037/0033-295X.93.2 | doi-broken-date= 2018-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American psychologist [[Zick Rubin]] sought to define ''love'' by [[psychometrics]] in the 1970s. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Zick|title=Measurement of Romantic Love|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=16|pages=265–27{{clarify|date=June 2014}}|year=1970|doi=10.1037/h0029841|pmid=5479131|issue=2|citeseerx=10.1.1.452.3207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Zick|title=Liking and Loving: an invitation to social psychology|location=New York|publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following developments in electrical theories such as [[Coulomb's law]], which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed, such as "opposites attract". Over the last century, research on the nature of human mating has generally found this not to be true when it comes to character and personality—people tend to like people similar to themselves. However, in a few unusual and specific domains, such as [[immune system]]s, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike themselves (e.g., with an orthogonal immune system), since this will lead to a baby that has the best of both worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berscheid | first = Ellen | authorlink = Ellen S. Berscheid |author2=Walster, Elaine H. | title = Interpersonal Attraction | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Co | year = 1969 | id = CCCN 69-17443 | isbn = 978-0-201-00560-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, various [[human bonding]] theories have been developed, described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and affinities.
Some Western authorities disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic and the narcissistic. This view is represented in the works of [[M. Scott Peck|Scott Peck]], whose work in the field of [[applied psychology]] explored the definitions of love and evil. Peck maintains that love is a combination of the "concern for the spiritual growth of another," and simple narcissism.&lt;ref name="peck"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Road Less Traveled | isbn=978-0-671-25067-6 | last=Peck | first=Scott | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | year=1978 | page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combination, love is an ''activity'', not simply a feeling.
{{Close Relationships|emotions}}

Psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] maintained in his book ''[[The Art of Loving]]'' that love is not merely a feeling but is also actions, and that in fact, the "feeling" of love is superficial in comparison to one's commitment to love via a series of loving actions over time.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"/&gt; In this sense, Fromm held that love is ultimately not a feeling at all, but rather is a commitment to, and adherence to, loving actions towards another, oneself, or many others, over a sustained duration.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"/&gt; Fromm also described love as a conscious choice that in its early stages might originate as an involuntary feeling, but which then later no longer depends on those feelings, but rather depends only on conscious commitment.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"/&gt;

===Evolutionary basis===
[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|''[[Wall of Love]]'' on [[Montmartre]] in Paris: "I love you" in 250 languages]]

[[Evolutionary psychology]] has attempted to provide various reasons for love as a survival tool. Humans are dependent on parental help for a large portion of their lifespans compared to other mammals. Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote parental support of children for this extended time period. Furthermore, researchers as early as [[Charles Darwin]] himself identified unique features of human love compared to other mammals and credit love as a major factor for creating social support systems that enabled the development and expansion of the human species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Darwin's Lost Theory of Love: A Healing Vision for the 21st Century |last= Loye|first= David S. |year= 2000|publisher= iUniverse|location= |isbn= 978-0595001316|oclc= |page= 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor may be that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s can cause, among other effects, permanently reduced [[fertility]], injury to the fetus, and increase complications during [[childbirth]]. This would favor monogamous relationships over [[polygamy]].&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005. Chapter 14, Commitment, Love, and Mate Retention by Lorne Campbell and Bruce J. Ellis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of scientific models===
Biological models of love tend to see it as a mammalian drive, similar to [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Certainly love is influenced by [[hormone]]s (such as [[oxytocin]]), [[neurotrophins]] (such as [[nerve growth factor|NGF]]), and [[pheromone]]s, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by their conceptions of love. The conventional view in [[biology]] is that there are two major drives in love: [[sexual attraction]] and [[attachment theory|attachment]]. Attachment between adults is presumed to work on the same principles that lead an infant to become attached to its mother. The traditional psychological view sees love as being a combination of [[companionate love]] and passionate love. Passionate love is intense longing, and is often accompanied by [[physiological arousal]] (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate); companionate love is affection and a feeling of intimacy not accompanied by physiological arousal.

==Cultural views==
===Ancient Greek===
{{See also|Greek words for love}}
[[File:Eros bow Musei Capitolini MC410.jpg|thumb|Roman copy of a Greek sculpture by [[Lysippus]] depicting [[Eros]], the Greek personification of romantic love]]
[[Greek language|Greek]] distinguishes [[Greek words for love|several different senses]] in which the word "love" is used. Ancient Greeks identified four forms of love: kinship or [[familial love|familiarity]] (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], ''[[storge]]''), [[friendship]] and/or [[platonic love|platonic desire]] (''[[philia]]''), sexual and/or [[romance (love)|romantic desire]] (''[[eros (concept)|eros]]''), and [[Kenosis|self-emptying]] or divine love (''[[agape]]'').&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''[[The Four Loves]]'', 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PlatonicSchool"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kristeller |first=Paul Oskar |title=Renaissance Thought and the Arts: Collected Essays |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-691-02010-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stendhal]], in his book ''On Love'' ("De l'amour"; Paris, 1822), distinguished carnal love, passionate love, a kind of uncommitted love that he called "taste-love", and love of vanity. [[Denis de Rougemont]] in his book ''Love in the Western World'' traced the story of passionate love (''l'amour-passion'') from its courtly to its romantic forms. [[Benjamin Péret]], in the introduction to his ''Anthology of Sublime Love'' (Paris, 1956), further identified "sublime love", a state of realized idealisation perhaps equatable with the romantic form of passionate love.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with Greek (as with many other languages), it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally. At the same time, the Ancient Greek text of the [[Bible]] has examples of the [[verb]] ''agapo'' having the same meaning as ''[[phileo]]''.

''[[Agapē|Agape]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἀγάπη}} ''agápē'') means ''love'' in modern-day Greek. The term ''s'agapo'' means ''I love you'' in Greek. The word ''agapo'' is the verb ''I love''. It generally refers to a "pure," [[ideal type]] of love, rather than the physical attraction suggested by ''eros''. However, there are some examples of ''agape'' used to mean the same as ''eros''. It has also been translated as "love of the soul."&lt;ref name="Anders Theodor Samuel Nygren 1936"&gt;Anders Theodor Samuel Nygren, ''[[Eros and Agape]]'' (first published in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], 1930-1936).&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Eros (love)|Eros]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἔρως}} ''érōs'') (from the Greek deity [[Eros]]) is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Greek word ''erota'' means ''in love''. [[Plato]] refined his own definition. Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. Eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. Some translations list it as "love of the body".&lt;ref name="Anders Theodor Samuel Nygren 1936"/&gt;

''[[Philia]]'' ({{lang|grc|φιλία}} ''philía''), a dispassionate virtuous love, was a concept addressed and developed by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book VIII.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/love/|title=Philosophy of Love {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes loyalty to friends, family, and community, and requires virtue, equality, and familiarity. Philia is motivated by practical reasons; one or both of the parties benefit from the relationship. It can also mean "love of the mind."

''[[Storge]]'' ({{lang|grc|στοργή}} ''storgē'') is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring.

''[[Xenia (Greek)|Xenia]]'' (ξενία ''xenía''), hospitality, was an extremely important practice in [[ancient Greece]]. It was an almost ritualized friendship formed between a host and his guest, who could previously have been strangers. The host fed and provided quarters for the guest, who was expected to repay only with gratitude. The importance of this can be seen throughout [[Greek mythology]]—in particular, [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''.

===Ancient Roman (Latin)===
The [[Latin|Latin language]] has several different verbs corresponding to the English word "love." ''[[wikt:amo#Latin|amō]]'' is the basic verb meaning ''I love'', with the infinitive ''[[wikt:amare#Italian|amare]]'' (“to love”) as it still is in [[Italian language|Italian]] today. The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come ''amans''—a lover, amator, "professional lover," often with the accessory notion of lechery—and ''amica'', "girlfriend" in the English sense, often being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is ''amor'' (the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City, [[Rome]]—in Latin: ''Roma''—can be viewed as an [[anagram]] for ''amor'', which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, Reden und Schweigen, Munich, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces ''amicus''—"friend"—and ''amicitia'', "friendship" (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to "indebtedness" or "influence"). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia''), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' (''The Art of Love''), which addresses, in depth, everything from [[Affair|extramarital affairs]] to overprotective parents.

Latin sometimes uses ''amāre'' where English would simply say ''to like''. This notion, however, is much more generally expressed in Latin by the terms ''placere'' or ''delectāre'', which are used more colloquially, the latter used frequently in the love poetry of [[Catullus]]. ''Diligere'' often has the notion "to be affectionate for," "to esteem," and rarely if ever is used for romantic love. This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun ''diligentia'', however, has the meaning of "diligence" or "carefulness," and has little semantic overlap with the verb. ''Observare'' is a synonym for ''diligere''; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun, ''observantia'', often denote "esteem" or "affection." ''[[Charity (virtue)|Caritas]]'' is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean "charitable love"; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan [[Latin literature|Roman literature]]. As it arises from a [[conflation]] with a Greek word, there is no corresponding verb.

===Chinese and other Sinic cultures===
[[File:Love-zh.svg|thumb|upright|{{lang|zh|愛}} (Mandarin: ''ài''), the traditional [[Chinese character]] for love contains a [[heart]] ({{lang|zh|心}}) in the middle.]]

Two philosophical underpinnings of love exist in the Chinese tradition, one from [[Confucianism]] which emphasized actions and duty while the other came from [[Mohism]] which championed a universal love.  A core concept to Confucianism is {{lang|zh|{{linktext|仁}}}} (''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]]'', "benevolent love"), which focuses on duty, action and attitude in a relationship rather than love itself.  In Confucianism, one displays benevolent love by performing actions such as [[filial piety]] from children, kindness from parent, loyalty to the king and so forth.

The concept of {{lang|zh|愛}} (Mandarin: ''ài'') was developed by the Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]] in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love.  Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of "universal love" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|兼愛}}}}, ''jiān'ài''). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally.  Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations.  Later in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the term ''Ai'' ({{lang|zh|愛}}) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, ''Ai'' was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.

In [[Mandarin Chinese]], {{lang|zh|{{linktext|愛}}}} (''ài'') is often used as the equivalent of the Western concept of love. {{lang|zh|{{linktext|愛}}}} (''ài'') is used as both a verb (e.g. {{lang|zh|我愛你}}, ''Wǒ ài nǐ'' , or "I love you") and a noun (such as {{lang|zh|{{linktext|愛情}}}} ''àiqíng'', or "romantic love"). However, due to the influence of Confucian {{lang|zh|{{linktext|仁}}}} (''rén''), the phrase {{lang|zh|我愛你}} (''Wǒ ài nǐ'', I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying "I love you" as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a more casual way. Consequently, "I like you" ({{lang|zh|我喜欢你}}, ''Wǒ xǐhuan nǐ'') is a more common way of expressing affection in Chinese; it is more playful and less serious.&lt;ref&gt;JFK Miller, "[http://shanghai.urbanatomy.com/index.php/i-ahearts-shanghai/85-i-love-shanghai/429-why-the-chinese-dont-say-qi-love-youq Why the Chinese Don't Say I Love You] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124202633/http://shanghai.urbanatomy.com/index.php/i-ahearts-shanghai/85-i-love-shanghai/429-why-the-chinese-dont-say-qi-love-youq |date=24 January 2010 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true in Japanese (''suki da'', {{lang|ja|好きだ}}).

The [[Japanese language]] uses three words to convey the English equivalent of "love".  Because "love" covers a wide range of emotions and behavioral phenomena, there are nuances distinguishing the three terms.&lt;ref name="Ryang2006"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ryang | first1 = Sonia | title = Love in Modern Japan: Its Estrangement from Self, Sex and Society | year = 2006 | publisher = Routledge | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tkOUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 | pages = 13–14| isbn = 9781135988630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Abe | first1 = Namiko | url = http://japanese.about.com/od/japanesecultur1/a/The-Japanese-Words-For-Love.htm | title = Japanese Words for "Love": The Difference between "Ai" and "Koi" | publisher = About.com | accessdate = 5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term {{Nihongo|''ai''|愛}}, which is often associated with maternal love&lt;ref name="Ryang2006"/&gt; or selfless love,&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; originally referred to beauty and was often used in religious context.  Following the [[Meiji Restoration]] 1868, the term became associated with "love" in order to translate Western literature.  Prior to Western influence, the term {{Nihongo|''koi''|恋}} generally represented romantic love, and was often the subject of the popular [[Man'yōshū]] Japanese poetry collection.&lt;ref name="Ryang2006"/&gt;  ''Koi'' describes a longing for a member of the opposite sex and is typical interpreted as selfish and wanting.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;  The term's origins come from the concept of lonely solitude as a result of separation from a loved one.  Though modern usage of ''koi'' focuses on sexual love and infatuation, the Manyō used the term to cover a wider range of situations, including tenderness, benevolence, and material desire.&lt;ref name="Ryang2006"/&gt;  The third term, {{Nihongo|''ren'ai''|恋愛}}, is a more modern construction that combines the [[kanji]] characters for both ''ai'' and ''koi'', though its usage more closely resembles that of ''koi'' in the form of romantic love.&lt;ref name="Ryang2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

The concept kama is found in some of the earliest known verses in [[Veda]]s. For example, Book 10 of Rig Veda describes the creation of the universe from nothing by the great heat. There in hymn 129, it states:
{{Quote|

===Abrahamic religions===
[[File:Ahava.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Indiana]]'s 1977 [[Love (sculpture)|''Love'' sculpture]] spelling ''ahava''.]]

====Christianity====
The Christian understanding is that love comes from God. The love of man and woman—''eros'' in Greek—and the unselfish love of others (''agape''), are often contrasted as "descending" and "ascending" love, respectively, but are ultimately the same thing.&lt;ref name="vatican1"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html
|author=Pope Benedict XVI
|title=papal encyclical, Deus Caritas Est}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several Greek words for "love" that are regularly referred to in Christian circles.
* ''[[Agape]]'': In the [[New Testament]], ''agapē'' is charitable, selfless, altruistic, and unconditional. It is parental love, seen as creating goodness in the world; it is the way [[God]] is seen to love humanity, and it is seen as the kind of love that Christians aspire to have for one another.&lt;ref name="Anders Theodor Samuel Nygren 1936"/&gt;
* ''[[Phileo]]'': Also used in the New Testament, ''phileo'' is a human response to something that is found to be delightful. Also known as "brotherly love."
* Two other [[#Ancient Greek|words for love in the Greek language]], ''[[Eros (love)|eros]]'' (sexual love) and ''[[storge]]'' (child-to-parent love), were never used in the New Testament.&lt;ref name="Anders Theodor Samuel Nygren 1936"/&gt;

[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that to ''Love God with all your heart, mind, and strength'' and ''Love your [[neighbourhood|neighbor]] as yourself'' are the two most important things in life (the [[Great Commandment|greatest commandment]] of the Jewish [[Torah]], according to [[Jesus]]; cf. [[Gospel of Mark]] chapter 12, verses 28–34). [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] summarized this when he wrote "Love God, and do as thou wilt."

[[File:baglione.jpg|thumb|upright|''Sacred and Profane Love'' (1602–03) by [[Giovanni Baglione]]. Intended as an attack on his hated enemy the artist [[Caravaggio]], it shows a boy (hinting at Caravaggio's homosexuality) on one side, a devil with Caravaggio's face on the other, and between an angel representing pure, meaning non-erotic, love.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wga.hu/html_m/b/baglione/sacred2.html Description of Sacred and Profane Love&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[The Apostle Paul]] glorified love as the most important virtue of all. Describing love in the famous poetic interpretation in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], he wrote, "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres." ([[1 Corinthians|1 Cor.]] 13:4–7, [[NIV]])

[[John the Apostle|The Apostle John]] wrote, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him." ([[Gospel of John|John]] 3:16–17, NIV) John also wrote, "Dear friends, let us love one another for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love." ([[1 John]] 4:7–8, NIV)

[[Saint Augustine]] says that one must be able to decipher the difference between love and lust. Lust, according to Saint Augustine, is an overindulgence, but to love and be loved is what he has sought for his entire life. He even says, “I was in love with love.” Finally, he does fall in love and is loved back, by God. Saint Augustine says the only one who can love you truly and fully is God, because love with a human only allows for flaws such as "jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and contention." According to Saint Augustine, to love God is "to attain the peace which is yours." (Saint Augustine's ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'')

Augustine regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as the heart of Christian faith and the interpretation of the Bible. After the review of Christian doctrine, Augustine treats the problem of love in terms of use and enjoyment until the end of Book I of ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (1.22.21-1.40.44;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B. Hoon | title=Augustine's Hermeneutics and Homiletics in ''De doctrina christiana'' | journal= Journal of Christian Philosophy | year=2013 | volume=17 | url=https://www.academia.edu/5228314 |pages=97–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian [[Theology|theologians]] see God as the source of love, which is mirrored in humans and their own loving relationships. Influential Christian theologian [[C.S. Lewis]] wrote a book called ''[[The Four Loves]]''. [[Benedict XVI]] named his first [[encyclical]] ''[[Deus caritas est|God is love]]''. He said that a human being, created in the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others ([[agape]]) and by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation (eros). This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as [[Mother Teresa|Teresa of Calcutta]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them.&lt;ref name="vatican1"/&gt;

[[Pope Francis]] taught that "True love is both loving and letting oneself be loved..what is important in love is not our loving, but allowing ourselves to be loved by God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2015/january/documents/papa-francesco_20150118_srilanka-filippine-incontro-giovani.html|title=Sri Lanka - Philippines: Meeting with the young people in the sports field of Santo Tomas University (Manila, 18 January 2015) - Francis|website=w2.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; And so, in the analysis of a Catholic theologian, for Pope Francis, "the key to love...is not our activity. It is the activity of the greatest, and the source, of all the powers in the universe: God’s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/82535/the-key-to-love-according-to-pope-francis|title=The key to love according to Pope Francis|first=Raul|last=Nidoy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christianity the practical definition of love is summarised by [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], who defined love as "to will the good of another," or to desire for another to succeed.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt; This is an explanation of the Christian need to love others, including their enemies. As Thomas Aquinas explains, Christian love is motivated by the need to see others succeed in life, to be good people.

Regarding love for enemies, Jesus is quoted in the Gospel of Matthew chapter five:

"You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’  But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven.  He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.  If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?  Are not even the tax collectors doing that?  And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others?  Do not even pagans do that?  Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
- Matthew 5: 43-48''

Tertullian wrote regarding love for enemies: "Our individual, extraordinary, and perfect goodness consists in loving our enemies.  To love one's friends is common practice, to love one's enemies only among Christians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Swartley | first=Willard M. | title=The Love of Enemy and Nonretaliation in the New Testament, Studies in peace and scripture; (As Scapulam I) cited by Hans Haas, Idee und Ideal de Feindesliebe in der ausserchristlichen Welt (Leipzig: University of Leipzig, 1927) | publisher= Westminster John Knox Press | year= 1992 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qjbYqFHzg_EC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Our+individual,+extraordinary,+and+perfect+goodness#v=onepage&amp;q=Our%20individual%2C%20extraordinary%2C%20and%20perfect%20goodness&amp;f=false |page=24 | isbn=9780664253547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
{{see also|Jewish views on love}}
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], {{lang|he|אהבה}} (''ahava'') is the most commonly used term for both interpersonal love and love between God and God's creations. [[Chesed]], often translated as loving-kindness, is used to describe many forms of love between human beings.

The commandment to love other people is given in the [[Torah]], which states, "Love your neighbor like yourself" ([[Leviticus]] 19:18). The Torah's commandment to love [[God]] "with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might" ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:5) is taken by the [[Mishnah]] (a central text of the Jewish [[oral law]]) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all of one's possessions, and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5). [[Rabbinic literature]] differs as to how this love can be developed, e.g., by contemplating divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature. As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: "See life with the wife you love" ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:9). The biblical book [[Song of Solomon]] is considered a romantically phrased metaphor of love between [[God]] and his people, but in its plain reading, reads like a love song.  The 20th-century [[Rabbi]] [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] is frequently quoted as defining love from the Jewish point of view as "giving without expecting to take" (from his ''Michtav me-Eliyahu'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;1).

====Islam====
Love encompasses the Islamic view of life as universal brotherhood that applies to all who hold faith. Amongst the 99 names of God ([[Allah]]), there is the name ''Al-Wadud'', or "the Loving One," which is found in Surah {{Quran-usc|11|90|q=}} as well as Surah {{Quran-usc|85|14|q=}}. God is also referenced at the beginning of every chapter in the Qur'an as ''Ar-Rahman'' and ''Ar-Rahim'', or the "Most Compassionate" and the "Most Merciful", indicating that nobody is more loving, compassionate and benevolent than God. The Qur'an refers to God as being "full of loving kindness."

The Qur'an exhorts Muslim believers to treat all people, those who have not persecuted them, with ''birr'' or "deep kindness" as stated in Surah {{Quran-usc|6|8-9|q=}}. ''Birr'' is also used by the Qur'an in describing the love and kindness that children must show to their parents.

''[[Ishq]]'', or divine love, is the emphasis of [[Sufism]] in the Islamic tradition. Practitioners of Sufism believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe. God desires to recognize beauty, and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God "looks" at himself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is often referred to as the religion of love.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms, which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved, with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through love, humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace. The saints of Sufism are infamous for being "drunk" due to their [[love of God]]; hence, the constant reference to wine in Sufi poetry and music.

====Bahá'í Faith====
In his [[Paris Talks]], [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] described four types of love: the love that flows from God to human beings; the love that flows from human beings to God; the love of God towards the Self or Identity of God; and the love of human beings for human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PT/pt-59.html|title=Bahá'í Reference Library - Paris Talks, Pages 179-181|website=reference.bahai.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian religions===
====Buddhism====
In [[Buddhism]], ''[[Kāma]]'' is sensuous, sexual love. It is an obstacle on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], since it is selfish. ''[[Karuṇā]]'' is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom and is necessary for enlightenment. ''Adveṣa'' and ''[[mettā]]'' are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from ordinary love, which is usually about attachment and sex and which rarely occurs without self-interest. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare.

The [[Bodhisattva]] ideal in Mahayana Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. The strongest motivation one has in order to take the path of the Bodhisattva is the idea of salvation within unselfish, altruistic love for all sentient beings.

====Hinduism====

[[File:Kama Rati.jpg|thumb|upright|Kama (left) with Rati on a temple wall of [[Chennakesava Temple]], [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]]]]
In [[Hinduism]], ''[[kāma]]'' is pleasurable, sexual love, personified by the god [[Kamadeva]]. For many Hindu schools, it is the third end (''[[Kama#Kama in Hinduism|Kama]]'') in life. Kamadeva is often pictured holding a bow of [[sugar cane]] and an arrow of flowers; he may ride upon a great parrot. He is usually accompanied by his consort [[Rati]] and his companion Vasanta, lord of the spring season. Stone images of Kamadeva and Rati can be seen on the door of the Chennakeshava temple at Belur, in [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. ''Maara'' is another name for ''kāma''.

In contrast to ''kāma'', ''prema''{{spaced ndash}}or ''prem''{{spaced ndash}}refers to elevated love. ''[[Karuṇā|Karuna]]'' is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. ''Bhakti'' is a [[Sanskrit]] term, meaning "loving devotion to the supreme God." A person who practices ''bhakti'' is called a ''bhakta''. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of ''[[bhakti]]'', which can be found in the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' and works by [[Tulsidas]]. The philosophical work ''[[Narada Bhakti Sutra]]s'', written by an unknown author (presumed to be [[Narada]]), distinguishes eleven forms of love.

In certain Vaishnava sects within Hinduism, attaining unadulterated, unconditional and incessant love for Godhead is considered the foremost goal of life. Gaudiya Vaishnavas who worship Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cause of all causes consider Love for Godhead (Prema) to act in two ways: sambhoga and vipralambha (union and separation)—two opposites .&lt;ref name="Krishna Prema"&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168632408280|author=Gour Govinda Swami|title=Wonderful Characteristic of Krishna Prema, Gour Govinda Swami}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the condition of separation, there is an acute yearning for being with the beloved and in the condition of union there is supreme happiness and nectarean. Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider that Krishna-prema (Love for Godhead) is not fire but that it still burns away one's material desires. They consider that Kṛṣṇa-prema is not a weapon, but it still pierces the heart. It is not water, but it washes away everything—one's pride, religious rules, and one's shyness. Krishna-prema is considered to make one drown in the ocean of transcendental ecstasy and pleasure. The love of Radha, a cowherd girl, for Krishna is often cited as the supreme example of love for Godhead by Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Radha is considered to be the internal potency of Krishna, and is the supreme lover of Godhead. Her example of love is considered to be beyond the understanding of material realm as it surpasses any form of selfish love or lust that is visible in the material world. The reciprocal love between Radha (the supreme lover) and Krishna (God as the Supremely Loved) is the subject of many poetic compositions in India such as the ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' and ''Hari Bhakti Shuddhodhaya.''

In the Bhakti tradition within Hinduism, it is believed that execution of devotional service to God leads to the development of Love for God ''(taiche bhakti-phale krsne prema upajaya)'', and as love for God increases in the heart, the more one becomes free from material contamination ''(krishna-prema asvada haile, bhava nasa paya)''.  Being perfectly in love with God or Krishna makes one perfectly free from material contamination. and this is the ultimate way of salvation or liberation. In this tradition, salvation or liberation is considered inferior to love, and just an incidental by-product. Being absorbed in Love for God is considered to be the perfection of life.&lt;ref name="Perfect Love"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prabhupadanugas.eu/?p=23368 |author=A C Bhaktivedanta Swami|title=Being Perfectly in Love}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free love===
{{Main|Free love}}
The term "free love" has been used&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/h/Hand-bookOfTheOneidaCommunity/ The Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613152552/http://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/h/Hand-bookOfTheOneidaCommunity/ |date=13 June 2010 }} of the [[Oneida Community]] claims to have coined the term around 1850, and laments that its use was appropriated by [[socialist]]s to attack marriage, an institution that they felt protected women and children from abandonment&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a [[social movement]] that rejects [[marriage]], which is seen as a form of social bondage. The Free Love movement's initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, [[birth control]], and [[adultery]]. It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. "The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism." ''Libertarian Enterprise'' .19 (1996): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people in the early 19th century believed that marriage was an important aspect of life to "fulfill earthly human happiness." Middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world. This mentality created a vision of strongly defined gender roles, which provoked the advancement of the free love movement as a contrast.&lt;ref name="Spurlock, John C 1988"&gt;Spurlock, John C. ''Free Love Marriage and Middle-Class Radicalism in America''. New York, NY: New York UP, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "sex radical" has been used interchangeably with the term "free lover".{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forceful sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases.&lt;ref name="Passet, Joanne E 2003"&gt;Passet, Joanne E. ''Sex Radicals and the Quest for Women's Equality''. Chicago, IL: U of Illinois P, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; These are also beliefs of [[Feminism]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Citation | title= Love's Lessons: Intimacy, Pedagogy and Political Community| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Hannah | last2= Stark | journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume= 22 | issue= 4 | pages= 69–79 | year= 2017 | url = https://www.academia.edu/35349930 | doi=10.1080/0969725x.2017.1406048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical views==
{{Main|Philosophy of love}}
[[File:Where is the love.jpg|thumb|[[Graffiti]] in [[East Timor]]]]

The philosophy of love is a field of [[social philosophy]] and [[ethics]] that attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of love.&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard. ''Works of Love.''&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical investigation of love includes the tasks of distinguishing between the various kinds of personal love, asking if and how love is or can be justified, asking what the [[value (ethics)|value]] of love is, and what impact love has on the [[autonomy]] of both the lover and the beloved.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Many different theories attempt to [[explanation|explain]] the nature and function of love. Explaining love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved would be very difficult because to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of love are: [[psychology|psychological]] theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; [[Evolutionary theory|evolutionary theories]] which hold that love is part of the process of [[natural selection]]; [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual theories]] which may, for instance consider love to be a gift from a god; and theories that consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a [[mysticism|mystical experience]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42349">In [[economics]], utility is the satisfaction or benefit derived by consuming a product; thus the '''marginal utility''' of a [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] is the change in the utility from an increase in the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of that good or service. 

In the context of [[cardinal utility]], economists sometimes speak of a '''law of diminishing marginal utility''', meaning that the first [[units of measurement|unit]] of consumption of a good or service yields more utility than the second and subsequent units, with a continuing reduction for greater amounts. Therefore, the fall in marginal utility as consumption increases is known as diminishing marginal utility. Mathematically:
:MU&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;......&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

== Marginality ==
The term ''marginal'' refers to a small change, starting from some baseline level. As [[Philip Wicksteed]] explained the term,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marginal considerations are considerations which concern a slight increase or diminution of the stock of anything which we possess or are considering&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Frequently the marginal change is assumed to start from the [[Capital (economics)#Endowment|endowment]], meaning the total resources available for consumption (see [[Budget constraint]]). This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made by the individual himself or herself and by others.

For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical analysis]] that goods and services are [[Continuum (theory)|continuously divisible]]. Under this assumption, [[marginal concepts]], including marginal utility, may be expressed in terms of [[differential calculus]]. Marginal utility can then be defined as the first derivative of total utility—the total satisfaction obtained from consumption of a good or service—with respect to the amount of consumption of that good or service.

In practice the smallest relevant division may be quite large. Sometimes economic analysis concerns the marginal values associated with a change of one unit of a discrete good or service, such as a motor vehicle or a haircut. For a motor vehicle, the total number of motor vehicles produced is large enough for a continuous assumption to be reasonable: this may not be true for, say, an aircraft carrier.

== Utility ==
{{Main|Utility}}
Depending on which theory of ''utility'' is used, the interpretation of marginal utility can be meaningful or not. Economists have commonly described utility as if it were ''quantifiable'', that is, as if different levels of utility could be compared along a numerical scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; ''The Development of Utility Theory'', I and II, ''Journal of Political Economy'' (1950), issues 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; ''The Adoption of Marginal Utility Theory'', ''History of Political Economy'' (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; This has affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility. Quantitative concepts of utility allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.

Contemporary mainstream economic theory frequently defers metaphysical questions, and merely notes or assumes that preference structures conforming to certain rules can be usefully ''proxied'' by associating goods, services, or their uses with quantities, and ''defines'' "utility" as such a quantification.&lt;ref&gt;[[David M. Kreps|Kreps, David Marc]]; ''A Course in Microeconomic Theory'', Chapter two: ''The theory of consumer choice and demand'', ''Utility representations''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another conception is [[Utilitarianism|Benthamite philosophy]], which equated usefulness with the production of pleasure and avoidance of pain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham, Jeremy]]; ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', Chapter I §I–III.&lt;/ref&gt; assumed subject to arithmetic operation.&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Jeremy; ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', Chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt; British economists, under the influence of this philosophy (especially by way of [[John Stuart Mill]]), viewed utility as "the feelings of pleasure and pain"&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley; “Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”, ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'' v29 (June 1866) §2.&lt;/ref&gt; and further as a "''quantity'' of feeling" (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley; ''Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy'', ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'' v29 (June 1866) §4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though generally pursued outside of the mainstream methods, there are conceptions of utility that do not rely on quantification.
For example, the [[Austrian school]] generally attributes value to ''the satisfaction of wants'',&lt;ref&gt;Menger, Carl; ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre'' (''Principles of Economics'') Chapter 2 §2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"&gt;[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen, Nicholas]]; ''Utility'', ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes rejects even the ''possibility'' of quantification.&lt;ref name="mises" &gt;[[Ludwig von Mises|von Mises, Ludwig Heinrich]]; ''Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufsmittel'' (1912).&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been argued that the Austrian framework makes it possible to consider rational preferences that would otherwise be excluded.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch"&gt;Mc Culloch, James Huston; [https://www.mises.org/etexts/mcCulloch.pdf “The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility”,] ''Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie'' 37 (1977) #3&amp;amp;4 (September).&lt;/ref&gt;

In any standard framework, the same object may have different marginal utilities for different people, reflecting different preferences or individual circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Herbert Joseph; ''The Economics of Enterprise'' (1913) Ch VII, pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept in cardinal utility theory that marginal utilities diminish across the ranges relevant to decision-making is called the "law of diminishing marginal utility" (and is also known as [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen|Gossen]]'s [[Gossen's laws|First Law]]). This refers to the increase in utility an individual gains from increasing their consumption of a particular good. "The law of diminishing marginal utility is at the heart of the explanation of numerous economic phenomena, including [[time preference]] and the [[Value (economics)|value of goods]] ... The law says, first, that the marginal utility of each homogenous unit decreases as the supply of units increases (and vice versa); second, that the marginal utility of a larger-sized unit is greater than the marginal utility of a smaller-sized unit (and vice versa). The first law denotes the law of diminishing marginal utility, the second law denotes the law of increasing total utility."&lt;ref name=Mises/&gt;

In modern economics, choice under conditions of certainty at a single point in time  is modeled via [[ordinal utility]], in which the numbers assigned to the utility of a particular circumstance of the individual have no meaning by themselves, but which of two alternative circumstances has higher utility ''is'' meaningful. With ordinal utility, a person's preferences have no unique marginal utility, and thus whether or not marginal utility is diminishing is not meaningful. In contrast, the concept of diminishing marginal utility is meaningful in the context of [[cardinal utility]], which in modern economics is used in analyzing [[intertemporal choice]], [[expected utility hypothesis|choice under uncertainty]], and [[social welfare function|social welfare]].

The law of diminishing marginal utility is similar to the law of [[diminishing returns]] which states that as the amount of one [[Factors of production|factor of production]] increases as all other factors of production are held the same, the marginal return (extra output gained by adding an extra unit) decreases.

As the rate of commodity acquisition increases, ''marginal'' utility decreases. If commodity consumption continues to rise, marginal utility at some point may fall to '''zero''', reaching '''maximum''' total utility. Further increase in consumption of units of commodities causes marginal utility to become '''negative'''; this signifies '''dissatisfaction'''. For example,
* beyond some point, further doses of antibiotics would kill no pathogens at all, and might even become harmful to the body.
* to satiate thirst a person drinks water but beyond a point, consumption of more water might make the person vomit, hence leading to negative marginal and thus diminished total utility
* it takes a certain amount of food energy to sustain a population, yet beyond a point, more calories cannot be consumed and are simply discarded (or cause disease).

Diminishing marginal utility is traditionally a microeconomic concept and often holds for an individual, although the marginal utility of a good or service might be ''increasing'' as well. For example:
* bed sheets, which up to some number may only provide warmth, but after that point may be useful to allow one to effect an escape by being tied together into a rope;
* tickets, for travel or theatre, where a second ticket might allow one to take a date on an otherwise uninteresting outing;
* dosages of antibiotics, where having too few pills would leave bacteria with greater resistance, but a full supply could effect a cure.
* the third leg is more useful than the first two when building a chair.

As suggested elsewhere in this article, occasionally one may come across a situation in which marginal utility increases even at a macroeconomic level. For example, the provision of a service may only be viable if it accessible to most or all of the population, and the marginal utility of a raw material required to provide such a service will increase at the "tipping point" at which this occurs. This is similar to the position with very large items such as aircraft carriers: the numbers of these items involved are so small that marginal utility is no longer a helpful concept, as there is merely a simple "yes" or "no" decision.

== Marginalist theory ==
[[Marginalism]] explains choice with the hypothesis that people decide whether to effect any given change based on the marginal utility of that change, with rival alternatives being chosen based upon which has the greatest marginal utility.

=== Market price and diminishing marginal utility ===
If an individual possesses a good or service whose marginal utility to him is less than that of some other good or service for which he could trade it, then it is in his interest to effect that trade. Of course, as one thing is sold and another is bought, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades will change. If the marginal utility of one thing is diminishing, and the other is not increasing, all else being equal, an individual will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed. (One important way in which all else might not be equal is when the use of the one good or service complements that of the other. In such cases, exchange ratios might be constant.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;) If any trader can better his position by offering a trade more favorable to complementary traders, then he will do so.

In an economy with [[money]], the marginal utility of a quantity is simply that of the best good or service that it could purchase. In this way it is useful for explaining [[supply and demand]], as well as essential aspects of models of [[imperfect competition]].

[[Image:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|right|105px|Adam Smith]]

==== The paradox of water and diamonds ====
{{Main|Paradox of value}}
The "paradox of water and diamonds", usually most commonly associated with [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam; ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Chapter IV. "Of the Origin and Use of Money"&lt;/ref&gt; though recognized by earlier thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first = Scott|last = Gordon|year = 1991|title = History and Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter = The Scottish Enlightenment of the eighteenth century|publisher = [[Routledge]]|isbn = 0-415-09670-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the apparent contradiction that water possesses a value far lower than diamonds, even though water is far more vital to a human being.

Price is determined by both marginal utility and marginal cost, and here the key to the "paradox" is that the marginal cost of water is far lower than that of diamonds.

That is not to say that the price of any good or service is simply a function of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual. Rather, individuals are willing to trade based upon the respective marginal utilities of the goods that they have or desire (with these marginal utilities being distinct for each potential trader), and prices thus develop constrained by these marginal utilities.

== Quantified marginal utility ==
Under the [[special case]] in which usefulness can be quantified, the change in utility of moving from state &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; to state &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U=U(S_2)-U(S_1)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; are distinguishable by values of just one variable &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; which is itself quantified, then it becomes possible to speak of the ratio of the marginal utility of the change in &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; to the size of that change:
[[Image:UtilityQuantified.svg|thumb|right|400px|Diminishing marginal utility, given quantification]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;
(where “[[ceteris paribus|c.p.]]” indicates that the ''only'' [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] to change is &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt;).

Mainstream neoclassical economics will typically assume that the limit
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta g\to 0} \left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;
exists, and use “marginal utility” to refer to the [[partial derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial g}=\lim_{\Delta g\to 0}\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;.
Accordingly, diminishing marginal utility corresponds to the condition
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial g^2}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

== History ==
The concept of marginal utility grew out of attempts by economists to explain the determination of price.  The term “marginal utility”, credited to the [[Austrian School|Austrian]] economist [[Friedrich von Wieser]] by [[Alfred Marshall]],&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Alfred; ''Principles of Economics'',  3 Ch 3 Note.&lt;/ref&gt; was a translation of Wieser's term “Grenznutzen” (''border-use'').&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser,  Friedrich; ''Über  den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and  Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p.  128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="wieser_zwei"&gt;Wieser, Friedrich von; ''Der natürliche Werth''  &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Natural Value''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1889), Bk I Ch V  “Marginal Utility” ([http://praxeology.net/FW-NV-I-5.htm HTML]).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proto-marginalist approaches ===
Perhaps the essence of a notion of diminishing marginal utility can be found in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], wherein he writes {{Quotation|external goods have a limit, like any other instrument, and all things useful are of such a nature that where there is too much of them they must either do harm, or at any rate be of no use&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''Politics'', Bk 7 Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}} (There has been marked disagreement about the development and role of marginal considerations in Aristotle's value theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soudek |first=Josef |title=Aristotle's Theory of Exchange: An Inquiry into the Origin of Economic Analysis |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=96 |issue=1 |year=1952 |pages=45–75 |jstor=3143742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kauder"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kauder |first=Emil |title=Genesis of the Marginal Utility Theory from Aristotle to the End of the Eighteenth Century |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=63 |issue=251 |year=1953 |pages=638–50 |jstor=2226451 |doi=10.2307/2226451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Barry Lewis John |title=Aristotle and the Development of Value Theory |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=115–28 |year=1964 |jstor=1880547 |doi=10.2307/1880547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schumArist"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Part II Chapter 1 §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, Scott; ''Aristoteles' Economic Thought'' (1995) Chapters 1, 2, &amp; 6.&lt;/ref&gt;)

A great variety of economists have concluded that there is ''some'' sort of interrelationship between utility and rarity that affects economic decisions, and in turn informs the determination of prices. Diamonds are priced higher than water because their marginal utility is higher than water .&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Přibram|Přibram, Karl]]; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteenth-century Italian [[Mercantilism|mercantilists]], such as [[Antonio Genovesi]], [[Giammaria Ortes]], [[Pietro Verri]], [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Marchese Cesare di Beccaria]], and [[Giovanni Rinaldo|Count Giovanni Rinaldo Carli]], held that value was explained in terms of the general utility and of scarcity, though they did not typically work-out a theory of how these interacted.&lt;ref name="pribramItalMerc"&gt;Pribram, Karl; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983), Chapter 5 “Refined Mercantilism”, “Italian Mercantilists”.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Della moneta'' (1751), Abbé [[Ferdinando Galiani]], a pupil of Genovesi, attempted to explain value as a ratio of two ratios, ''utility'' and ''scarcity'', with the latter component ratio being the ratio of quantity to use.
[[Image:Richard Whately.jpg|thumb|right|105px|Richard Whately]]
[[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]], in ''Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution de richesse'' (1769), held that value derived from the general utility of the class to which a good belonged, from comparison of present and future wants, and from anticipated difficulties in procurement.

Like the Italian mercantists, [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Étienne Bonnot, Abbé de Condillac]], saw value as determined by utility associated with the class to which the good belong, and by estimated scarcity.  In ''De commerce et le gouvernement'' (1776), Condillac emphasized that value is not based upon cost but that costs were paid because of value.

This last point was famously restated by the Nineteenth Century proto-marginalist, [[Richard Whately]], who in ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy'' (1832) wrote {{Quotation|It is not that pearls fetch a high price because men have dived for them; but on the contrary, men dive for them because they fetch a high price.&lt;ref&gt;Whately, Richard; ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy, Being part of a course delivered in the Easter term'' (1832).&lt;/ref&gt;}} (Whatley's student [[Nassau William Senior|Senior]] is noted below as an early marginalist.)

=== Marginalists before the Revolution ===
[[Image:Gabriel Cramer.jpg|thumb|105px|Gabriel Cramer]]

The first unambiguous published statement of any sort of theory of marginal utility was by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], in “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis”.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis” in ''Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae'' 5 (1738); reprinted in translation as “Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk” in ''Econometrica'' 22 (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;  This paper appeared in 1738, but a draft had been written in 1731 or in 1732.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; letter of 4 July 1731 to Nicolas Bernoulli ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Nicolas; letter of 5 April 1732, acknowledging receipt of “Specimen theoriae novae metiendi sortem pecuniariam” ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1728, [[Gabriel Cramer]] had produced fundamentally the same theory in a private letter.&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Garbriel; letter of 21 May 1728 to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nicolaus Bernoulli]] ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  Each had sought to resolve the [[St. Petersburg paradox]], and had concluded that the marginal desirability of money decreased as it was accumulated, more specifically such that the desirability of a sum were the [[natural logarithm]] (Bernoulli) or [[square root]] (Cramer) thereof.  However, the more general implications of this hypothesis were not explicated, and the work fell into obscurity.

In [http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/lloyd/value “A Lecture on the Notion of Value as Distinguished Not Only from Utility, but also from Value in Exchange”], delivered in 1833 and included in ''Lectures on Population, Value, Poor Laws and Rent'' (1837), [[William Forster Lloyd]] explicitly offered a general marginal utility theory, but did not offer its derivation nor elaborate its implications.  The importance of his statement seems to have been lost on everyone (including Lloyd) until the early 20th century, by which time others had independently developed and popularized the same insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman |last=Seligman |first=E. R. A. |title=On Some Neglected British Economists |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=13 |issue=51 |pages=335–63 |year=1903 |jstor=2221519 |doi=10.2307/2221519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''An Outline of the Science of Political Economy'' (1836), [[Nassau William Senior]] asserted that marginal utilities were the ultimate determinant of demand, yet apparently did not pursue implications, though some interpret his work as indeed doing just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=White |first=Michael V. |title=Diamonds Are Forever(?): Nassau Senior and Utility Theory |journal=[[The Manchester School (journal)|The Manchester School]] |volume=60 |year=1992 |issue=1 |pages=64–78 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.1992.tb00211.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In “De la mesure de l’utilité des travaux publics” (1844), [[Jules Dupuit]] applied a conception of marginal utility to the problem of determining bridge tolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dupuit |first=Jules |title=De la mesure de l’utilité des travaux publics |journal=Annales des ponts et chaussées |series=Second series |volume=8 |year=1844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] published ''Die Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln'', which presented a marginal utility theory and to a very large extent worked-out its implications for the behavior of a market economy.  However, Gossen's work was not well received in the Germany of his time, most copies were destroyed unsold, and he was virtually forgotten until rediscovered after the so-called Marginal Revolution.

=== The Marginal Revolution ===
Marginalism eventually found a foothold by way of the work of three economists, [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] in England, [[Carl Menger|Menger]] in Austria, and [[Léon Walras|Walras]] in Switzerland.
[[Image:Jevons.jpeg|thumb|105px|William Stanley Jevons]]
[[William Stanley Jevons]] first proposed the theory in [http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/jevons/mathem.txt “A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”] ([http://www.eco.utexas.edu/~hmcleave/jevonsmath.pdf PDF]), a paper presented in 1862 and published in 1863, followed by a series of works culminating in his book ''The Theory of Political Economy'' in 1871 that established his reputation as a leading political economist and logician of the time. Jevons' conception of utility was in the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] tradition of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and of [[John Stuart Mill]], but he differed from his [[classical economics|classical]] predecessors in emphasizing that "value depends entirely upon utility", in particular, on "final utility upon which the theory of Economics will be found to turn."&lt;ref&gt;W. Stanley Jevons (1871), ''The Theory of Political Economy'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; He later qualified this in deriving the result that in a model of exchange equilibrium, price ratios would be proportional not only to ratios of "final degrees of utility," but also to costs of production.&lt;ref&gt;W. Stanley Jevons (1879, 2nd ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=jevons+%22the+theory+of+political+economy%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=IyxPG-thjm&amp;sig=ta6Vv6bIPxNZVaqyxFoGfv39Od8#PPA203,M1 ''The Theory of Political Economy''], p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Collison Brown (1987), "Jevons, William Stanley," [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 2, pp. 1008–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Menger]] presented the theory in [http://docs.mises.de/Menger/Menger_Grundsaetze.pdf ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre''] (translated as [https://www.mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp ''Principles of Economics'']) in 1871.  Menger's presentation is peculiarly notable on two points.  First, he took special pains to explain ''why'' individuals should be expected to rank possible uses and then to use marginal utility to decide amongst trade-offs. (For this reason, Menger and his followers are sometimes called “the Psychological School”, though they are more frequently known as “the [[Austrian School]]” or as “the Vienna School”.) Second, while his illustrative examples present utility as quantified, his essential assumptions do not.&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen" /&gt; (Menger in fact crossed-out the numerical tables in his own copy of the published ''Grundsätze''.&lt;ref&gt;Kauder, Emil; ''A History of Marginal Utility Theory'' (1965), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;) Menger also developed the [[law of diminishing marginal utility]].&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;Polleit, Thorsten (2011-02-11) [https://mises.org/daily/5014/What-Can-the-Law-of-Diminishing-Marginal-Utility-Teach-Us What Can the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility Teach Us?], ''[[Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Menger's work found a significant and appreciative audience.

[[Léon Walras|Marie-Esprit-Léon Walras]] introduced the theory in ''Éléments d'économie politique pure'', the first part of which was published in 1874 in a relatively mathematical exposition.  Walras's work found relatively few readers at the time but was recognized and incorporated two decades later in the work of [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] and [[Enrico Barone|Barone]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Walker  (1987), "Walras, Léon" ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 4, p. 862.&lt;/ref&gt;

An American, [[John Bates Clark]], is sometimes also mentioned.  But, while Clark independently arrived at a marginal utility theory, he did little to advance it until it was clear that the followers of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were revolutionizing economics.  Nonetheless, his contributions thereafter were profound.

==== The second generation ====
[[Image:Vilfredo Pareto 1870s2.jpg|thumb|105px|Vilfredo Pareto]]
Although the Marginal Revolution flowed from the work of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, their work might have failed to enter the mainstream were it not for a second generation of economists.  In England, the second generation were exemplified by [[Philip Wicksteed|Philip Henry Wicksteed]], by [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]], and by [[Alfred Marshall]]; in Austria by [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] and by [[Friedrich von Wieser]]; in Switzerland by [[Vilfredo Pareto]]; and in America by [[Herbert Joseph Davenport]] and by [[Frank Fetter|Frank A. Fetter]].

There were significant, distinguishing features amongst the approaches of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, but the second generation did not maintain distinctions along national or linguistic lines.  The work of von Wieser was heavily influenced by that of Walras.  Wicksteed was heavily influenced by Menger.  Fetter referred to himself and Davenport as part of “the American Psychological School”, named in imitation of the Austrian “Psychological School”. (And Clark's work from this period onward similarly shows heavy influence by Menger.)  William Smart began as a conveyor of Austrian School theory to English-language readers, though he fell increasingly under the influence of Marshall.&lt;ref name="salerno"&gt;Salerno, Joseph T. 1999; “The Place of Mises’s Human Action in the Development of Modern Economic Thought.” ''Quarterly Journal of Economic Thought'' v. 2 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Böhm-Bawerk was perhaps the most able expositor of Menger's conception.&lt;ref name="salerno" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von. “Grundzüge der Theorie des wirtschaftlichen Güterwerthes”, ''Jahrbüche für Nationalökonomie und Statistik'' v 13 (1886).  Translated as ''Basic Principles of Economic Value''.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was further noted for producing a theory of interest and of profit in equilibrium based upon the interaction of diminishing marginal utility with diminishing [[marginal product]]ivity of time and with [[time preference]].&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; ''Kapital Und Kapitalizns. Zweite Abteilung: Positive Theorie des Kapitales'' (1889). Translated as ''Capital and Interest. II: Positive Theory of Capital'' with appendices rendered as ''Further Essays on Capital and Interest''.&lt;/ref&gt; (This theory was adopted in full and then further developed by [[Knut Wicksell]]&lt;ref&gt;Wicksell, Johan Gustaf Knut; ''Über Wert, Kapital unde Rente'' (1893). Translated as [https://www.mises.org/books/valuecapital.pdf ''Value, Capital and Rent''.]&lt;/ref&gt; and, with modifications including formal disregard for time-preference, by Wicksell's American rival [[Irving Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Irving; ''Theory of Interest'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;)

Marshall was the second-generation marginalist whose work on marginal utility came most to inform the mainstream of neoclassical economics, especially by way of his ''Principles of Economics'', the first volume of which was published in 1890.  Marshall constructed the demand curve with the aid of assumptions that utility was quantified, and that the marginal utility of money was constant (or nearly so).  Like Jevons, Marshall did not see an explanation for supply in the theory of marginal utility, so he synthesized an explanation of demand thus explained with supply explained in a more [[Classical economics|classical]] manner, determined by costs which were taken to be objectively determined.  (Marshall later actively mischaracterized the criticism that these costs were themselves ultimately determined by marginal utilities.&lt;ref name="schumMarshScis"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Pt IV Ch 6 §4.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==== The Marginal Revolution and Marxism ====
[[Karl Marx]] acknowledged that "nothing can have value, without being an object of utility",&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl Heinrich; ''Capital'' V1 Ch 1 §1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl Heinrich; [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/f239-289.htm ''Grundrisse''] (completed in 1857 though not published until much later)&lt;/ref&gt; but, in his analysis, "use-value as such lies outside the sphere of investigation of political economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl Heinrich]]: ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy''] (1859), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; with labor being the principal determinant of value under capitalism.

The doctrines of marginalism and the Marginal Revolution are often interpreted as somehow a response to [[Marxism|Marxist economics]]. However the first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' was not published until July 1867, after the works of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were written or well under way (In 1874 Walras published Éléments d'économie politique pure and Carl Menger published Principles of Economics in 1871) ; and Marx was still a relatively minor figure when these works were completed. It is unlikely that any of them knew anything of him. (On the other hand, [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] or [[William Warren Bartley|Bartley]] has suggested that Marx, voraciously reading at the [[British Museum]], may have come across the works of one or more of these figures, and that his inability to formulate a viable critique may account for his failure to complete any further volumes of ''Kapital'' before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, Friedrich August von, with [[William Warren Bartley|William Warren Bartley III]]; ''The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism'' (1988) p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Nonetheless, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the generation who followed the preceptors of the Revolution succeeded partly because they could formulate straightforward responses to Marxist economic theory. The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, ''Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems'' (1896),&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von: "''Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems''" &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;"On the Closure of the Marxist System"&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ''Staatswiss. Arbeiten. Festgabe für [[Karl Knies|K. Knies]]'' (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; but the first was Wicksteed's "The Marxian Theory of Value. ''Das Kapital'': a criticism" (1884,&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; "Das Kapital: A Criticism", ''To-day'' 2 (1884) pp. 388–409.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder" in 1885&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder", ''To-day'' 3 (1885) pp. 177–79.&lt;/ref&gt;). Initially there were only a few Marxist responses to marginalism, of which the most famous were [[Rudolf Hilferding]]'s ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904)&lt;ref&gt;Hilferding, Rudolf: ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904). Translated as ''Böhm-Bawerk's Criticism of Marx''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Politicheskoy ekonomni rante'' (1914) by [[Nikolai Bukharin|Никола́й Ива́нович Буха́рин (Nikolai Bukharin)]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin|Буха́рин, Никола́й Ива́нович (Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin)]]; ''Политической экономии рантье'' (1914). Translated as [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1927/leisure-economics/ ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class''].&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the course of the 20th century a considerable literature developed on the conflict between marginalism and the labour theory of value, with the work of the neo-Ricardian economist [[Piero Sraffa]] providing an important critique of marginalism.

It might also be noted that some followers of [[Henry George]] similarly consider marginalism and neoclassical economics a reaction to ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', which was published in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mason Gaffney|Gaffney, Mason]], and Fred Harrison: ''The Corruption of Economics'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s [[John Roemer]] and other [[Analytical Marxism#Exploitation|analytical Marxists]] have worked to rebuild Marxian theses on a marginalist foundation.

=== Reformulation ===
In his 1881 work [http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/edgeworth/mathpsychics.pdf ''Mathematical Psychics''], [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] presented the [[indifference curve]], deriving its properties from marginalist theory which assumed utility to be a differentiable function of quantified goods and services. Later work attempted to generalize to the indifference curve formulations of utility and marginal utility in avoiding unobservable measures of utility.

In 1915, [[Eugen Slutsky]] derived a theory of consumer choice solely from properties of indifference curves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Slutsky|Слуцкий, Евгений Евгениевич (Slutsky, Yevgyeniy Ye.)]]; "Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore", ''Giornale degli Economisti'' 51 (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of [[World War I|the World War]], the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], and his own subsequent loss of interest, Slutsky's work drew almost no notice, but similar work in 1934 by [[John Hicks|John Richard Hicks]] and [[R. G. D. Allen]]&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, John Richard, and Roy George Douglas Allen; "A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value", ''Economica'' 54 (1934).&lt;/ref&gt; derived much the same results and found a significant audience. (Allen subsequently drew attention to Slutsky's earlier accomplishment.)

Although some of the third generation of Austrian School economists had by 1911 rejected the quantification of utility while continuing to think in terms of marginal utility,&lt;ref name="mises" /&gt; most economists presumed that utility must be a sort of quantity. Indifference curve analysis seemed to represent a way to dispense with presumptions of quantification, albeit that a seemingly arbitrary assumption (admitted by Hicks to be a "rabbit out of a hat"&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. 2"Utility and Preference" §8, p. 23 in the 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;) about decreasing marginal rates of substitution&lt;ref name="hicks_vc"&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. "Utility and Preference" §7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; would then have to be introduced to have convexity of indifference curves.

For those who accepted that indifference curve analysis superseded earlier marginal utility analysis, the latter became at best perhaps pedagogically useful, but "old fashioned" and observationally unnecessary.&lt;ref name="hicks_vc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="samuelson"&gt;Samuelson, Paul Anthony; "Complementarity: An Essay on the 40th Anniversary of the Hicks-Allen Revolution in Demand Theory", ''Journal of Economic Literature'' vol 12 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival ===
[[Image:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|105px|[[John von Neumann]]]]
When Cramer and Bernoulli introduced the notion of diminishing marginal utility, it had been to address [[St. Petersburg paradox|a paradox of gambling]], rather than the [[paradox of value]].  The marginalists of the revolution, however, had been formally concerned with problems in which there was neither [[risk]] nor [[uncertainty]].  So too with the indifference curve analysis of Slutsky, Hicks, and Allen.

The [[expected utility hypothesis]] of Bernoulli and others was revived by various 20th century thinkers, with early contributions by [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] (1926),&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Frank Plumpton; "Truth and Probability" ([http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf  PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227205205/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}), Chapter VII in ''The Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays'' (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]] (1944),&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, John and Oskar Morgenstern; ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage]] (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Leonard Jimmie: ''Foundations of Statistics'' (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; Although this hypothesis remains controversial, it brings not only utility, but a quantified conception of utility (cardinal utility), back into the mainstream of economic thought.

A major reason why quantified models of utility are influential today is that risk and uncertainty have been recognized as central topics in contemporary economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Peter, and Michael Rothschild, eds.: ''Uncertainty in Economics'' (1989). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantified utility models simplify the analysis of risky decisions because, under quantified utility, diminishing marginal utility implies [[risk aversion]].&lt;ref&gt;Demange, Gabriel, and Guy Laroque: ''Finance and the Economics of Uncertainty'' (2006), Ch. 3, pp. 71–72. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and portfolio choice require stronger assumptions than diminishing marginal utility, such as the assumption of [[Prudence#Prudence in economics and finance|prudence]], which means [[convex function|convex]] marginal utility.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Miles (1990), "Precautionary Saving in the Small and in the Large", ''[[Econometrica]]'', 58 (1) pp. 53–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Austrian School continued to develop its ordinalist notions of marginal utility analysis, formally demonstrating that from them proceed the decreasing marginal rates of substitution of indifference curves.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

'''Martial race''' was a designation created by army officials of [[British India]] after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], where they classified each [[caste]] into one of two categories, 'martial' and 'non-martial'. The ostensible reason was that a 'martial race' was typically brave and well-built for fighting,&lt;ref name=rand&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rand|first=Gavin|title=Martial Races and Imperial Subjects: Violence and Governance in Colonial India 1857–1914|journal= European Review of History|volume=13|issue=1|pages=1–20|publisher=Routledge|date=March 2006|url=|doi=10.1080/13507480600586726}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the 'non-martial races' were those whom the British believed to be unfit for battle because of their [[sedentary lifestyle]]s. However, an alternative hypothesis is that British-trained Indian soldiers were among those who rebelled in 1857 and thereafter recruitment policy favoured castes which had remained loyal to the British and diminished or abandoned recruitment from the catchment area of the [[Bengal army]].&lt;ref name="Street"&gt;{{cite book |title=Martial Races: The military, race and masculinity in British Imperial Culture, 1857-1914 |last=Streets |first=Heather |year=2004 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-7190-6962-8 |page=241 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BscnZT_1po8C |accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept already had a precedent in Indian culture as one of the four orders ([[Varna (Hinduism)|varnas]]) in the [[Vedic]] social system of Hinduism is known as the [[Kshatriya]], literally "warriors."&lt;ref name="gbook1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_SrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA301 | title=The Indian Postcolonial: A Critical Reader | publisher=Routledge | work=Literary Collections › Asian › General | date=2010 | accessdate=11 October 2014 | author=Elleke Boehmer, Professor of Colonial and Post-Colonial Literature Elleke Boehmer, Rosinka Chaudhuri | pages=301 | ISBN=9781136819575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
In their attempts to assert control in India, the British faced fierce resistance in some regions while easily conquering others. British officials sought 'martial races' accustomed to [[hunting]], or from agricultural cultures from hilly or mountainous regions with a history of conflict. Others were excluded due to their 'ease of living' or branded as [[Sedition|seditious]] agitators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenceindia.com/def_common/ethnic_group_recruitment.html Ethnic Group Recruitment in the Indian Army; by Dr. Omar Khalidi.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020114933/http://defenceindia.com/def_common/ethnic_group_recruitment.html |date=20 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[doctrine]] of 'martial races' postulated that the qualities that make a useful soldier are inherited and that most Indians, with the exception of the specified groups, did not have the requisite [[phenome|traits]] that would make them warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhut, Jeffrey (1984) Sahib and Sepoy: an Inquiry into the Relationship between the British Officers and Native Soldiers of the British Indian Army. (In: ''Military Affairs'', Vol. 48, No. 1 (Jan., 1984), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British recruited heavily from the 'martial races' for service in the [[colonial army]]. Sensing the inequalities and fierce loyalty to one's tribe or group of the diverse native peoples of the subcontinent, the British found opportunities to use it to their own great advantage. These already wide divides were a fertile breeding ground to inculcate pride in one's identity based on 'race'. This served the British in two ways. On the one hand it made sure that there was no repetition of the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] by ensuring there was no unity among the different subjects of the Raj. On the other hand, it encouraged a sense of competition among the different 'races'.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

British general and scholar Lieutenant-General Sir [[George MacMunn]] (1869–1952) noted in his writings "It is only necessary for a feeling to arise that it is impious and disgraceful to serve the British, for the whole of our fabric to tumble like a house of cards without a shot being fired or a sword unsheathed".&lt;ref&gt;MacMunn, G. F. (1911). The Armies of India; painted by Major A. C. Lovett. London: Adam &amp; Charles Black.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, it became British policy to recruit only from those tribes whom they classified as members of the 'martial races', and the practice became an integral part of the recruitment manuals for the Army in the British Raj. According to Jeffrey Greenhut, "The Martial Race theory had an elegant symmetry. Indians who were intelligent and educated were defined as cowards, while those defined as brave were uneducated and backward."&lt;ref&gt;Greenhut, Jeffrey (1983) The Imperial Reserve: the Indian Corps on the Western Front, 1914-15. In: ''The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History'', October 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British regarded the 'martial races' as valiant and strong but also intellectually inferior, lacking the initiative or leadership qualities to [[Commanding officer|command]] large military formations.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Philippa ( -?- ) Prostitution, Race and Politics: Policing Venereal Disease in the British Empire; p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also regarded as politically subservient or docile to authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=FbJT4FgtGRMhXvsp29ZJyywfJJQV1b4TDNx82HchLHJblJR3vdQ5!620065691?a=o&amp;d=5002436821 |title=Ethnic Group Recruitment in the Indian Army: The Contrasting Cases of Sikhs, Muslims, Gurkhas and Others by Omar Khalidi. |access-date=4 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420122843/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=FbJT4FgtGRMhXvsp29ZJyywfJJQV1b4TDNx82HchLHJblJR3vdQ5!620065691?a=o&amp;d=5002436821 |archive-date=20 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, the martial races theory did not lead to officers being recruited from them; recruitment was based on [[social class]] and loyalty to the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3680/is_200201/ai_n9022041 Ethnic group recruitment in the Indian army: The contrasting cases of Sikhs, Muslims, Gurkhas and others by Omar Khalidi.]&lt;/ref&gt; One source calls this a "pseudo-[[ethnological]]" construction, which was popularised by [[Frederick Sleigh Roberts]], and created serious deficiencies in troop levels during the [[World Wars]], compelling them to recruit from 'non-martial races'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-6146.html Country Data] - Based on the Country Studies Series by Federal Research Division of the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Churchill]] was reportedly concerned that the theory was abandoned during the war and wrote to the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]] that he must, "rely as much as possible on the martial races".&lt;ref&gt;Bose, Mihir. The Magic of Indian Cricket: Cricket and Society in India; p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Indian Independence movement|Indian Independence]], the [[Indian Army]] abandoned this theory and recruitment took place without discrimination.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Critics of the theory state that the Indian rebellion of 1857 may have played a role in reinforcing the British belief in it. During this event the troops from the Bengal Native Infantry led by [[sepoy]] [[Mangal Pandey]] mutinied against the British. However, the loyal [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], [[Gurkha]]s, [[Kumauni people|Kumaoni]]/[[Kumauni people|Kumaunis]] and [[Garhwali people|Garhwalis]] did not join the mutiny, and fought on the side of the British Army. From then on, this theory was used to the hilt to accelerate recruitment from among these 'races', whilst discouraging enlistment of 'disloyal' troops and high-caste [[Hindus]] who had sided with the rebel army during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/pakistan/8.htm Country Studies: Pakistan] - [[Library of Congress]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors, such as Heather Streets, argue that the military authorities puffed up the images of the martial soldiers by writing regimental histories, and by extolling the [[kilt]]ed Scots, [[kukri]]-wielding Gurkhas and [[turban]]ed Sikhs in numerous paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050701/asp/opinion/story_4933880.asp Book review of Martial Races: The military, race and masculinity in British Imperial Culture, 1857-1914 By Heather Streets] in [[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]].&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Schultz, an American author, has claimed the martial race concept as a supposedly clever British effort to [[divide and rule]] the people of India for their own political ends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Shultz|Shultz, Richard]]; Dew, Andrea ( -?- ). Insurgents, Terrorists, and Militias: The Warriors of Contemporary Combat; p. 47).&lt;/ref&gt;

The hillmen – Kumaonis, Garhwalis, [[Dogra]]s and [[Gurkha|Gorkha]]s – were initially a great impediment to the establishment of the British Empire, but once they gave their loyalty to the British they helped them greatly in their administration and were thus given the status of martial race.  Kumaonis had helped the British in their efforts against the Gurkhas in the [[Nepal War]].  When they were observed by the British to be fighting on both sides—the British as well as the Gorkha side—their valour was given recognition by the British and they were included in the British Army.  The [[3 Gorkha Rifles|3rd Gorkha Rifles]] was known as the Kumaon battalion when it was formed, and included Kumaonis and Garhwalis along with the Gorkhas.  The Kumaonis, once accepted as a martial race, were themselves to be recruited in the Hyderabad regiment and displace the native troops, ultimately becoming the [[Kumaon Regiment]] after the independence of India.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

British-declared martial races in the Indian subcontinent included some groups that were officially designated instead as "agricultural tribes" under the provisions of the [[Punjab Land Alienation Act, 1900|Punjab Land Alienation Act of 1900]]. These terms were considered to be synonymous when the administration compiled a list in 1925.

===By the Pakistani military===
Though seldom used in today's context, it has been alleged that [[Pakistan Military]] believed in the concept of martial races, and thought that they would easily defeat [[India]] in a war, especially prior to the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]].&lt;ref&gt;Insurgents, Terrorists, and Militias: The Warriors of Contemporary Combat [[Richard H. Shultz]], Andrea Dew: "The Martial Races Theory had firm adherents in Pakistan and this factor played a major role in the under-estimation of the Indian Army by Pakistani soldiers as well as civilian decision makers in 1965."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/november/sepoy.htm An Analysis The Sepoy Rebellion of 1857-59 by AH Amin] "The army officers of that period were convinced that they were a 'martial race' and the Hindus of Indian Army were cowards. Some say this was disproved in 1965 when, despite having more sophisticated equipment, numerical preponderance in tanks, and the element of surprise, the Pakistan Armoured Division miserably failed at [[Khem Karan]]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+in0189) United States Library of Congress Country Studies] "Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by 'Hindu India'."&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this belief in martial supremacy, it was popularly said that one Pakistani soldier was equal to four to ten Hindus or Indian soldiers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1965.htm Indo-Pakistan War of 1965].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/weekly/cowas/990718.htm End-game?

"India's army... quickly dispelled the popular Pakistani myth that one Muslim soldier was 'worth ten Hindus.'"&lt;/ref&gt; and thus numerical superiority of the foe could be overcome.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;The Idea of Pakistan
 By [[Stephen P. Cohen]] Published by Brookings Institution Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-8157-1502-1}} pp 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pakistan Army was also accused of [[bias]] and [[racism]] by the [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] of [[East Pakistan]] who felt humiliated by this dubious theory that was being floated in [[West Pakistan]], that they were not 'martially inclined' compared to the [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]] and [[Pashtuns]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bd0139) Library of Congress studies.]&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistani author [[Hasan Askari Rizvi|Hasan-Askari Rizvi]] notes that the limited recruitment of Bengali personnel in the Pakistan Army was because the West Pakistanis "could not overcome the hangover of the martial race theory".&lt;ref&gt;Military, State and Society in Pakistan by
Hasan-Askari Rizvi, Palgrave Macmillan, {{ISBN|0-312-23193-8}} (Pg 128).&lt;/ref&gt;

Defence writers in Pakistan have noted that the 1971 defeat was partially attributable to the flawed 'martial races' theory which led to [[wishful thinking]] that it was possible to defeat the [[Indian Army]] based on the theory alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/nov/pak-army.htm Pakistan's Defense Journal.]&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Stephen P. Cohen]] notes that "Elevating the 'martial races' theory to the level of an absolute truth had domestic implications for Pakistani politics and contributed to the neglect of other aspects of security."&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; Since then, the 'martial race' theory has rarely, if ever, been used by Pakistan.

Mass affluent consumers are an important target market for sellers of [[luxury goods]].

==Difference from upper middle income==
There may be a high correlation between the households in the upper-middle reaches of the income strata and the mass affluent, but there are differences. Social class is the result of a person's function within society rather than merely the income of the household in which he or she resides. Both terms refer to people whose [[wealth]] or [[income]] is above the average, yet below the top. As opposed to households with above average incomes the mass affluent are also defined through [[liquid assets]] such as stocks, bonds, cash, and mutual funds. [[Fixed assets]] such as real estate are not commonly counted. This is because liquid assets provide more financial flexibility, which is a desirable trait in customers.

The mass affluent have been characterized as those who save more than they spend and invest for their future. While they worry about funding their children's college education, they realize other savings and loan options exist and they are not opposed to their children paying some part of their educational costs. The mass affluent generally may worry about replacing their paycheck in retirement, and may need to be encouraged to spend more money during their retirement years. They often wish to leave an inheritance to their children. The mass affluent will have between $500,000 and $1.5 million (USD) in investable assets upon retirement with a net worth between $500,000 and $2.5 million (USD). They spend between $4,000 and $10,000 (USD) per month in retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Marc S. Freedman. (Feb. 2, 2009).

==In the United States==
[[Image:Mass Affluent USA.jpg|thumb|400px|This graph shows the percentage of "Mass affluent" Americans.]]

'''Moral breakdown''' is a phenomenon in which a major degradation or complete loss of [[Morality|moral values]] takes place within a particular society. Other names for this phenomenon include Moral decay or Moral decline. The abruptness of such kind of degradation may vary depending on the situation and the events that take place within the given society over a certain time. Moral Breakdown may be caused by the changes in the political and/or cultural changes of the society, conflict or a natural disaster.

==Moral Breakdown and Natural Disasters==

A critical loss of moral or ethical values may take place during or past a major cataclysm which strikes a given society. One of the most known examples of moral breakdown originating from natural disasters took place during the epidemic of [[Black Death]] in Europe (1347–1350). The medieval society faced with the prospect of most certainly dying in a short time often chose to live its life to the fullest for as long as it could. Cases of heavy drinking, eating, adultery and other acts which were unethical/sinful to the contemporary Christian society took place. The people lost trust in the church and God since neither could provide a cure or safety from the pestilence.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral Breakdown and Conflicts==

According to Catholic Herald (1969) &lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| url = http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/28th-november-1969/4/the-moral-breakdown-of-an-army | title = The moral breakdown of an army | accessdate = 2013-04-23 | work = archive.catholicherald.co.uk}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; during the war in Vietnam the multiple atrocities were committed on both sides of the conflict. Where as the news report reads violence neither reduces nor nulls violence, as well as the fact that violence breeds violence. Conflicts strongly increase the degradation of ethical values as in the instance of the [[My Lai Massacre|massacre at pikville]] committed by the US army being silenced by the news of the first landing on the moon. In this particular instance one can see the Moral Breakdown caused by war not only within the ranks of the army, but also in the society.

==Moral Breakdown and Political/ Cultural changes==

During major political or cultural changes such as the modern liberalism in Germany in the 1920s 
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| url = http://fathersforlife.org/culture/kinsey11.htm | title = Moral decline in Germany after World War I| accessdate = 2013-04-23 | work = fathersforlife.org}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; one can see a great deterioration of moral values. The economic and political situation of Germany after the end of World War I led many to live in near poverty. The conclusion is, that a great shift in the wealth of people, both thrown at the bottom and on the top of the social hierarchy carries a degree of moral breakdown.

==Societal collapse==
Historians believe [[societal collapse]] and the overall disintegration of society from external or internal factors may exacerbate social discord and lead to a degradation of morality. Ancient Rome, for example, was notable for condoning [[infanticide]] and [[pedophilia]] almost from its foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Philo| authorlink = Philo| title =  The Special Laws| publisher =  [[Harvard University Press]]| year =  1950| location =  Cambridge| pages =  III, XX.117, Volume VII, pp. 118, 551, 549| url =| doi= | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Roman father could legally abandon or kill his children at any age, for any reason. It was particularly common for Roman parents to abandon or kill baby girls.&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;q=letter+pregnant|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, sexual exploitation of children was commonplace. It was possible to walk into almost any major Roman city and find brothels of child sex slaves for adults to exploit, castrated boys being a particularly-sought after delicacy. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = deMause| title = The Evolution of Childhood| publisher =  [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing]]| year =  1995| pages =  45, 46&lt;/ref&gt; Not coincidentally, a majority of Roman parents and several emperors, such as [[Tiberius]], are known to have engaged in sexually abusing children, either their own, or their child slaves. [[Quintilian]] in his Orator's Education denotes this: "“We [the adults] like it if they [the children] say something outrageous; we reward them with a smile and a kiss words that would be objectionable in an Alexandrian fancy boy! They see our mistresses, our boy lovers; every dinner party echoes with obscene songs; things are to be seen which are shameful to name!" In addition, he strongly implies it was not uncommon for Roman schoolteachers to sexually molest their students and threaten them with beatings if they told their parents. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Quintilian| title = The Orator's Education| publisher =  [[Harvard University Press]]| year =  2001| pages =  87, 94&lt;/ref&gt; Tiberius, for his part, was accused by both [[Tacitus]] and [[Suetonius]] of forcing small boys at fellatio while on retreat on Capri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Suetonius| title = The Lives of the Ceasars| publisher =  [[Harvard University Press]]| year =  1951|&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Tacitus| title = Annals| publisher =  [[Penguin Classics]]| year =  2012| pages = 98, 99&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other examples of moral breakdown occur when resources are dwindling at an unsustainable level compared to the overall influx of newer populations. This, as evidenced from ancient Rome and the ancient Mayans, creates a climate of hypercompetitive behavior between the various classes, creating a climate of plutocracy or extreme violence as manifested through Roman [[Gladiator]] shows and bizarre rituals that were previously viewed as hedonistic during the early stages of the society. As resources dwindle from economic decline, societies in decline are more focused on curbing the exhaustion of physical [[resources]] (food, water, infrastructure) and ignore the enforcement of [[social capital]] among the general public to conserve such physical resources.

[[File:Comparison double triple buffering.svg|thumb|320px|Sets '''1''', '''2''' and '''3''' represent the operation of single, double and triple buffering, respectively, with [[vertical synchronization]] (vsync) enabled. In each graph, time flows from left to right. Note that '''3''' shows a [[Swap Chain|swap chain]] with three buffers; the original definition of triple buffering would throw away frame C as soon as frame D finished, and start drawing frame E into buffer 1 with no delay. Set '''4''' shows what happens when a frame (B, in this case) takes longer than normal to draw. In this case, a frame update is missed. In time-sensitive implementations such as video playback, the whole frame may be dropped. With a three-buffer swap chain in set '''5''', drawing of frame B can start without having to wait for frame A to be copied to video memory, reducing the chance of a delayed frame missing its vertical retrace.]]

In [[computer science]], '''multiple buffering''' is the use of more than one [[buffer (computer science)|buffer]] to hold a block of data, so that a "reader" will see a complete (though perhaps old) version of the data, rather than a partially updated version of the data being created by a [[readers-writers problem|"writer"]]. It also is used to avoid the need to use [[dual-ported RAM]] (DPRAM) when the readers and writers are different devices.

== Description ==
An easy way to explain how multiple buffering works is to take a real-world example. It is a nice sunny day and you have decided to get the paddling pool out, only you can not find your garden hose. You'll have to fill the pool with buckets. So you fill one bucket (or buffer) from the tap, turn the tap off, walk over to the pool, pour the water in, walk back to the tap to repeat the exercise. This is analogous to single buffering. The tap has to be turned off while you "process" the bucket of water.

Now consider how you would do it if you had two buckets. You would fill the first bucket and then swap the second in under the running tap. You then have the length of time it takes for the second bucket to fill in order to empty the first into the paddling pool. When you return you can simply swap the buckets so that the first is now filling again, during which time you can empty the second into the pool. This can be repeated until the pool is full. It is clear to see that this technique will fill the pool far faster as there is much less time spent waiting, doing nothing, while buckets fill. This is analogous to double buffering. The tap can be on all the time and does not have to wait while the processing is done.

If you employed another person to carry a bucket to the pool while one is being filled and another emptied, then this would be analogous to triple buffering. If this step took long enough you could employ even more buckets, so that the tap is continuously running filling buckets.

In computer science the situation of having a running tap that cannot be, or should not be, turned off is common (such as a stream of audio). Also, computers typically prefer to deal with chunks of data rather than streams. In such situations, double buffering is often employed.

=== Double buffering Petri net ===
[[Image:Double Buffering Petri Net.png|thumb|Double Buffering Petri Net]]
The [[Petri net]] in the illustration shows how double buffering works. Transitions W1 and W2 represent writing to buffer 1 and 2 respectively while R1 and R2 represent reading from buffer 1 and 2 respectively.
At the beginning only the transition W1 is enabled. After W1 fires, R1 and W2 are both enabled and can proceed in parallel. When they finish, R2 and W1 proceed in parallel and so on.

So after the initial transient where W1 fires alone, this system is periodic and the transitions are enabled – always in pairs (R1 with W2 and R2 with W1 respectively).

== Double buffering in computer graphics{{anchor|Double_Graphics}} ==
&lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: [[Back buffer]] links here. --&gt;
In [[computer graphics]], '''double buffering''' is a technique for drawing graphics that shows no (or less) stutter, [[screen tearing|tearing]], and other artifacts.

It is difficult for a program to draw a display so that pixels do not change more than once. For instance, when updating a page of text, it is much easier to clear the entire page and then draw the letters than to somehow erase all the pixels that are not in both the old and new letters. However, this intermediate image is seen by the user as [[Flicker (screen)|flickering]]. In addition, [[computer monitor]]s constantly redraw the visible video page (at around 60 times a second), so even a perfect update may be visible momentarily as a horizontal divider between the "new" image and the un-redrawn "old" image, known as [[Page tearing|tearing]].

A software implementation of double buffering has all drawing operations store their results in some region of system [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]; any such region is often called a "back buffer".  When all drawing operations are considered complete, the whole region (or only the changed portion) is copied into the [[video RAM]] (the "front buffer"); this copying is usually synchronized with the monitor's [[raster graphics|raster]] beam in order to avoid tearing. Double buffering necessarily requires more memory and CPU time than single buffering because of the system memory allocated for the back buffer, the time for the copy operation, and the time waiting for synchronization.

[[Compositing window manager]]s often combine the "copying" operation with "[[compositing]]" used to position windows, transform them with scale or warping effects, and make portions transparent. Thus the "front buffer" may contain only the composite image seen on the screen, while there is a different "back buffer" for every window containing the non-composited image of the entire window contents.

=== Page flipping ===
In the page-flip method, instead of copying the data, both buffers are capable of being displayed (both are in VRAM). At any one time, one buffer is actively being displayed by the monitor, while the other, background buffer is being drawn. When the background buffer is complete, the roles of the two are switched. The page-flip is typically accomplished by modifying the value of a pointer to the beginning of the display data in the video memory.

The page-flip is much faster than copying the data and can guarantee that tearing will not be seen as long as the pages are switched over during the monitor's [[vertical blanking interval]]—the blank period when no video data is being drawn. The currently active and visible buffer is called the '''front buffer''', while the background page is called the "back buffer".

== Triple buffering ==
In [[computer graphics]], '''triple buffering''' is similar to double buffering but can provide improved performance. In double buffering, the program must wait until the finished drawing is copied or swapped before starting the next drawing. This waiting period could be several [[milliseconds]] during which neither buffer can be touched.

In triple buffering the program has two back buffers and can immediately start drawing in the one that is not involved in such copying. The third buffer, the front buffer, is read by the graphics card to display the image on the monitor. Once the image has been sent to the monitor, the front buffer is flipped with (or copied from) the back buffer holding the most recent complete image. Since one of the back buffers is always complete, the graphics card never has to wait for the software to complete. Consequently, the software and the graphics card are completely independent and can run at their own pace. Finally, the displayed image was started without waiting for synchronization and thus with minimum lag.&lt;ref name=anandtech-triple-buffering&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3591&amp;p=1|title=Triple Buffering: Why We Love It|publisher=AnandTech|date=June 26, 2009|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the software [[algorithm]] not having to poll the graphics hardware for monitor refresh events, the algorithm is free to run as fast as possible. This can mean that several drawings that are never displayed are written to the back buffers. Nvidia has implemented this method under the name "Fast Sync".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/10325/the-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-and-1070-founders-edition-review/13|title=The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 &amp; GTX 1070 Founders Editions Review: Kicking Off the FinFET Generation|last=Smith|first=Ryan|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative method sometimes referred to as triple buffering is a [[Swap Chain|swap chain]] three buffers long. After the program has drawn both back buffers, it waits until the first one is placed on the screen, before drawing another back buffer (i.e. it is a 3-long [[FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)|first in, first out]] queue). Most Windows games seem to refer to this method when enabling triple buffering.

== Quad buffering ==
The term '''quad buffering''' means the use of double buffering for each of the left and right eye images in [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] implementations, thus four buffers total (if triple buffering was used then there would be ''six'' buffers). The command to swap or copy the buffer typically applies to both pairs at once, so at no time does one eye see an older image than the other eye.

Quad buffering requires special support in the graphics card drivers which is disabled for most consumer cards. AMD's Radeon HD 6000 Series and newer support it [http://devgurus.amd.com/thread/158704].

3D standards like [[OpenGL]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec30.20080811.pdf OpenGL 3.0 Specification, Chapter 4]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Direct3D]] support quad buffering.

== Double buffering for DMA{{anchor|Double_DMA}} ==
The term '''double buffering''' is used for copying data between two buffers for [[direct memory access]] (DMA) transfers, ''not'' for enhancing performance, but to meet specific addressing requirements of a device (esp. 32-bit devices on systems with wider addressing provided via [[Physical Address Extension]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/server/PAE/PAEdrv.mspx#E2D|title=Physical Address Extension - PAE Memory and Windows|publisher=Microsoft Windows Hardware Development Central|year=2005|accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Windows]] [[device drivers]] are particularly noteworthy as a place where the term "double buffering" is likely to be used. Linux and BSD source code calls these "bounce buffers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chudov.com/tmp/LinuxVM/html/understand/node65.html|title=Understanding The Linux Virtual Memory Manager, 10.4 Bounce Buffers|author=Mel Gorman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
Double buffering is also used as a technique to facilitate [[interlacing]] or [[deinterlacing]] of video signals.

[[File:Jacob de Gheyn - Wapenhandelinge 4.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] musketeer, holding a [[musket]]; painting by [[Jacob de Gheyn II|Jacob van Gheyn]] in 1608]]
A '''musketeer''' ({{lang-fr|mousquetaire}}) was a type of [[soldier]] equipped with a [[musket]]. Musketeers were an important part of [[early modern warfare|early modern armies]], particularly in Europe&lt;!-- 'and the west' : West of what?--&gt;, as they normally comprised the majority of their infantry. The musketeer was a precursor to the [[rifleman]]. Muskets were replaced by rifles in most western armies during the mid-1850s. The traditional designation of "musketeer" for an infantry private survived in the [[Imperial German Army]] until [[World War I]].

[[File:Arms of Ming army5.jpg|thumb|[[Ming dynasty]] "machine gun"]]
The [[hand cannon]], the firearm from which all others descended, was invented in China in the 12th century and was in widespread use there in the 13th century. It spread west across Asia in the 14th century. Arquebusiers and musketeers were utilized in the armies of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] (1368–1644)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=esnWJkYRCJ4C&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Chase 2003], p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (1644–1911). In Zhao Shizhen's book of 1598 AD, the ''Shenqipu'', there were illustrations of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkish people|Turkish]] riflemen with detailed illustrations of their muskets, alongside European musketeers with detailed illustrations of their muskets.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 447 454"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 447–454.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an illustration and description of how the Chinese had adopted the Ottoman kneeling position in firing while favoring European-made muskets.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 449 452"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 449–452.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese also built the first repeating fire-arm, several barrels behind a small wooden shield: the musketeer would turn the barrels and light each barrel with a slow match one by one. These weapons were most effective being fired from walls or high positions. Needham considered this weapon to be a "primitive machine-gun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science and civilisation in China, Volume 5, Part 7 |author1=Joseph Needham |author2=Gwei-Djen Lu |author3=Ling Wang |editor=Joseph Needham|accessdate= 21 November 2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx-9mS6Aa4wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Science+and+civilisation+in+China,+Volume+5,+Part+7&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VyGzfkzP3i&amp;sig=kNUMktbGQNrdyjto1oFpsJvuz00&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J9YkUNbZL6iZiAfItoHYBA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Science%20and%20civilisation%20in%20China%2C%20Volume%205%2C%20Part%207&amp;f=false|archiveurl=  |volume=|edition=reprint |series=|date= |year=1987 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |language= |isbn=0-521-30358-3 |page=254|pages= |at= |chapter= |quote=makes its appearance, but now alongside all kinds of more modern things, such as mobile armoured shields for field-guns, bullet-moulds and muskets, and even a kind of primitive machine-gun. b The fire-lance was not yet quite dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chinese ideas about nature and society: studies in honour of Derk Bodde |author=Derk Bodde|editor1=Charles Le Blanc |editor2=Susan Blader |accessdate= 21 November 2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPQuETESw84C&amp;pg=PA326&amp;dq=Once+again+ithe+makes+its+appearance,+but+now+alongside+all+kinds+of+more+modern+things,+such+as+mobile+armoured+shields+for+field+guns,+bullet+moulds,+and+muskets,+and+even+a+kind+of+primitive+machine+gun.+the+fire+lance+was+not+yet+quite+dead&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ezrLTpjnCur20gHlwohD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Once%20again%20ithe%20makes%20its%20appearance%2C%20but%20now%20alongside%20all%20kinds%20of%20more%20modern%20things%2C%20such%20as%20mobile%20armoured%20shields%20for%20field%20guns%2C%20bullet%20moulds%2C%20and%20muskets%2C%20and%20even%20a%20kind%20of%20primitive%20machine%20gun.%20the%20fire%20lance%20was%20not%20yet%20quite%20dead&amp;f=false|archiveurl=  |volume=|edition= |series=|date= |year=1987 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |location= |language= |isbn=962-209-188-1 |page=326|pages= |at= |chapter= |quote=Once again the li hua ch'iang makes its appearance, but now alongside all kinds of more modern things, such as ... for field-guns, bullet moulds, and muskets, and even a kind of primitive machine- gun.96 The fire-lance was not yet quite }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DK2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=DK|title=Weapon: A Visual History of Arms and Armor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Px5E3EIF5jQC&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2 October 2006|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=978-0-7566-4219-8|pages=100–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Empire===
The famous [[Janissary]] corps of the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] were using [[matchlock]] muskets as early as the 1440s.&lt;ref name=Nicolle&gt;{{cite book| last = Nicolle| first = David| authorlink = David Nicolle| title = The Janissaries| publisher = [[Osprey]]| year = 1995| pages = 22| isbn = 1-85532-413-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman Empire]], centering on [[Turkey]] and extending into [[Arabia]], used muskets to conquer [[Constantinople]] (modern [[Istanbul]]) and were one of the earliest users of muskets in a military conflict. It also utilized large cannons, the [[Dardanelles Gun|Great Turkish Bombard]] and incendiary devices. They are also probably the first to use muskets aboard ships.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

===India===

Muskets became an integral part of Indian warfare in the 1600s. They were used as an effective defense against [[war elephant]]s. The Mughals, [[Maratha]]s, [[Rajputs]] and [[Sikhs]] made use of musketeers, firing from cover, to ambush opposing infantry, cavalry and elephants. Many Indian [[gunsmiths]] existed during the 17th and 18th centuries, creating regular muskets and some [[combination weapons]].{{fact|date=December 2016}}

In the [[Spanish army]], the ''[[Tercio]]'' or the ''Spanish Square'' was a mixed infantry formation that theoretically could have up to 3,000 pikemen, swordsmen and musketeers, although, on the battlefield, it was usually much smaller. It was nigh on invincible in its era, capitalizing on the brute strength and close-range abilities of the pikemen and the long-range projectile capabilities of the muskets. In practice, it appeared as a loosely formed [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] in function, but was far more flexible and deadly. The musketeer manned tercios were developed from the earlier [[arquebusier]] manned ''coronelías'', which had firmly established their fearsome reputation by defeating the French and capturing their king at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

{{Main|Streltsy}}
[[File:01 108 Book illustrations of Historical description of the clothes and weapons of Russian troops.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Streltsy]] in 1674]]
'''Streltsy''' ({{lang-ru|Стрельцы}}) were the [[Military unit|unit]]s of [[Russia]]n guardsmen ([[Grammatical number|sl.]] ''strelets'', стрелец. literally "shooter"; often translated as "musketeer", but more properly "harquebuses") from the 16th to the early 18th centuries, armed with [[firearms]] and [[halberd]]s. They are also collectively known as ''Strelets Troops'' (Стрелецкое Войско).

The first streltsy units were created by [[Ivan the Terrible]] sometime between 1545 and 1550 and armed with the [[arquebus]]. They first saw combat at the [[Siege of Kazan (1552)|Siege of Kazan]] in 1552. [[Military service]] in this unit became lifelong and [[hereditary]]. The bearded strelsty were organized into regiments, each with a long coat (''kaftans'') and pointed cloth hat of a distinctive colour. By 1680, there were 20 regiments of Moscow streltsy totaling 20,048 men and comprising about 12 per cent of the total army&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=V.|last=Shpakovsky|page=8|title=Armies of Ivan the Terrible|ISBN=1-84176-925-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (along with cossacks, militia and an increasing number of regular soldiers). In addition, there were significant numbers of frontier and garrison streltsy serving outside Moscow, although these were less formally drilled and equipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=V.|last=Shpakovsky|page=9|title=Armies of Ivan the Terrible|ISBN=1-84176-925-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Muscovite government was chronically short of cash so that the streltsy were often not paid well. While "entitled" to something like four rubles a year in the 1550s, they were often allowed to farm or trade in order to supplement their incomes. Textiles for clothing and foodstuffs were sometimes issued as part of their pay. A commander of one hundred musketeers (''sotnik'') received up to 20 roubles a year and a regimental head (''streletski golova'') between 30 and 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=V.|last=Shpakovsky|pages=19 &amp; 21|title=Armies of Ivan the Terrible|ISBN=1-84176-925-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 17th century, the Streltsy of Moscow began to actively participate in a struggle for power between different government groups, supporting the [[dissident]]s and showing hostility towards any foreign [[innovation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Angus|last=Konstam|page=9|title=Peter the Great's Army 1: Infantry|ISBN=1-85532-315-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of [[Sophia Alekseyevna]] in 1689, the government of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] engaged in a process of gradual limitation of the streltsy’s military and political influence. In order to counter their power, Peter began to raise a new regular army, still armed with muskets but disciplined, uniformed and organised along West European lines. In spite of these measures, the streltsy revolted yet again while Peter was on his Great Embassy in Europe. The four regiments involved were disbanded and 1,200 of the mutineers were executed. The remainder were exiled, had their property confiscated and were banned from future military employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Chris|last=Middleton|page=22|title=Winds of Revolution|ISBN=978-0809464586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire corps was technically abolished in 1689; however, after having suffered a defeat at [[Narva]] in 1700, the government retained some streltsy units in service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Angus|last=Konstam|pages=9|title=Peter the Great's Army 1: Infantry|ISBN=1-85532-315-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, the streltsy were incorporated into the regular army. At the same time, they started to disband the Municipal Streltsy. Liquidation of the streltsy units was finally finished only in the 1720s, however, the Municipal Strel'tsy were kept in some cities until the late 18th century.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

The [[Preobrazhensky regiment|Preobrazhensky]] and Semenovsky regiments of the [[Russian Imperial Guard|Imperial Guard]] replaced the streltsy as the political and military force closest to the tsar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Angus|last=Konstam|page=11&amp;12|title=Peter the Great's Army 1: Infantry|ISBN=1-85532-315-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===

[[File:Statue d'Artagnan Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|[[D'Artagnan]]'s monument in Paris]]
The [[Musketeers of the Guard]] were a junior unit, initially of roughly company strength, of the military branch of the [[Maison du Roi|Royal Household]] or ''Maison du Roi''. They were created in 1622 when [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] furnished a company of [[light cavalry]] (the [[Carabinier#French Carabiniers-à-Cheval|"carabiniers"]], created by Louis' father [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]) with muskets. Musketeers fought in battle both on foot as infantry and on horseback as [[dragoons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=9781780968612}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] in 1745 the King's Musketeers served as regular cavalry, charging British infantry with drawn swords.

As one of the junior units in the Royal Guard, the Musketeers were not closely linked to the royal family. Traditional bodyguard duties were in fact performed by the [[Garde du Corps (France)|Garde du Corps]] and the [[Swiss Guard|Cent-suisses]]. Because of its later establishment, the Musketeers were open to the lower classes of French nobility or younger sons from noble families whose oldest sons served in the more prestigious Garde du Corps and Chevau-legers (Light Horse). The Musketeers soon gained a reputation for boisterousness and fighting spirit because the only way for social and career advancement was excelling at their task as mounted light dragoons.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

Their high esprit de corps gained royal favor for the Musketeers and they were frequently seen at court and in Paris. Shortly after their creation, [[Cardinal Richelieu]] created a bodyguard unit for himself. So as not to offend the King with a perceived sense of self-importance, Richelieu did not name them Garde du Corps like the King's personal guards but rather Musketeers after the Kings' junior guard cavalry. This was the start of a bitter rivalry between the two corps of Musketeers. At the cardinal's death in 1642, the company passed to his successor [[Cardinal Mazarin]]. At Mazarin's death in 1661, the cardinal's Musketeers passed to [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to the disgust of both the King's Musketeers and the Cardinal's Musketeers. The Musketeers were subsequently reorganized as a guard cavalry regiment of two companies. The King's Musketeers became the first company, popularly known as "Grey Musketeers" (''mousquetaires gris''), while the Cardinal's Musketeers became the second company, known as "Black Musketeers" (''mousquetaires noirs'') for riding grey and black horses, respectively. From their establishment, the Musketeers wore blue cloak-like cassocks, lined with red and edged with silver embroidery. From 1688, the cassocks were replaced by smaller ''soubrevestes'' or sleeveless coats in the same colours. In the early decades of the corps, the musketeers had worn civilian dress under their cassocks, according to personal taste and means, but in 1677 a scarlet uniform was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rene|last=Chartrand

In terms of recruitment, the Musketeers were among the most sought after of the military companies of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''. This was due to the lower entrance requirements. The senior guard units were in effect closed to all but the most senior and wealthy of French nobles, so for the majority of French nobles (many of whom lived in genteel poverty), service in the Musketeers was the only way to join a mounted unit in the Royal Household and perhaps catch the King's eye. However, enlistment did require both letters of recommendation and evidence that a recruit had the family means to support the costs of service. These included the provision of horses, swords, clothing, a servant and equipment. Only the muskets and the distinctive blue cassock were provided by the monarch.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

In 1776, the Musketeers were disbanded by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], for budgetary reasons. Following the first Bourbon Restoration, the Musketeers were reestablished on 6 July 1814 along with the other military units of the former Royal Household. These expensive and aristocratic regiments proved ineffective when [[Napoleon]] returned from Elba, mostly dispersing though some accompanied [[Louis XVIII]] into brief exile. Following the second restoration of the Monarchy, the Musketeers were finally disbanded on 1 January 1816.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

Decades later, starting in 1844, this group was the subject of the now-famous serial publication ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', in the magazine ''Le Siècle'' between March and July 1844. The author, [[Alexandre Dumas, père]], based his work on the book ''Mémoires de [[Monsieur d'Artagnan]], capitaine lieutenant de la première compagnie des Mousquetaires du Roi'' (Memoirs of Mister d'Artagnan, lieutenant captain of the first company of the King's Musketeers) by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras (Cologne, 1700).{{fact|date=December 2016}}

===Sweden===
[[Swedish allotment system|Thanks to the reforms]] of [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]], the [[Swedish Army]] brought to maturity the new style of fighting that made Sweden into a great power in the 17th century. This style of fighting became the new standard throughout Europe and its colonies in the latter stages of musket dominated warfare. Manuals based on Gustav's own revolutionised the training and tactics of western armies.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

===Britain===
[[File:An heraldic supporter. A Pikeman of the Honourable Artillery Company, in sand.jpg|thumbnail|A heraldic supporter: a musketeer of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]], in sand, 19th century]]
The iconic "[[Red coat (British army)|Redcoat]]" of the [[British Empire]] was the staple unit in the British armies that created the largest empire in history. The British infantryman was equipped with the .75 calibre [[Land Pattern Musket]], or Brown Bess. He was well trained by the standards of the time, training with live ammunition. A fully trained redcoat could fire four times a minute. This, combined with the technique of firing by companies (a method wherein blocks of men fired smaller volleys in succession, creating a wave of fire down the front of the regiment), made it possible for the British musketeer to win pitched battles against superior numbers.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

The musket was withdrawn from service with the British Army in 1854, replaced by the muzzle-loading [[Minié rifle]], which had an accurate range of over three times that of the Brown Bess which it replaced.&lt;ref&gt;R.

'''Negative liberty''' is freedom from interference by other people. Negative liberty is primarily concerned with freedom from external restraint and contrasts with [[positive liberty]] (the possession of the power and resources to fulfil one's own potential). The distinction was introduced by [[Isaiah Berlin]] in his 1958 lecture "[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]".

== Overview ==
''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes negative liberty:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The negative concept of freedom ... is most commonly assumed in liberal defences of the constitutional liberties typical of liberal-democratic societies, such as freedom of movement, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech, and in arguments against paternalist or moralist state intervention. It is also often invoked in defences of the right to private property, although some have contested the claim that private property necessarily enhances negative liberty."&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Gerald Cohen|Cohen, G. A.]], 1991, ''Capitalism, Freedom and the Proletariat''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History ==
According to [[Thomas Hobbes]], "a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and will he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', Part 2, Ch. XXI; thus alluding to liberty in its negative sense).

[[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] expressed the following point clearly: "The free man is the man who is not in irons, nor imprisoned in a gaol, nor terrorized like a slave by the fear of punishment ... it is not lack of freedom, not to fly like an eagle or swim like a whale." Moreover, [[John Jay]], in [[The Federalist Papers|''The Federalist'' paper]] [[Federalist No. 2|No. 2]], stated that: "Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of Government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights, in order to vest it with requisite powers." Jay's meaning would be better expressed by substituting "negative liberty" in place of "natural rights", for the argument here is that the power or authority of a legitimate government derives in part from our accepting restrictions on negative liberty.

An idea that anticipates the distinction between negative and positive liberty was [[G. F. W. Hegel]]'s "[[sphere of abstract right]]" (furthered in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''), which constitutes what now is called negative freedom and his subsequent distinction between "abstract" and "positive liberty."&lt;ref&gt;George Klosko, [https://books.google.com/books?id=O5XvGdmuTkkC&amp;dq= ''History of Political Theory: An Introduction: Volume II: Modern''] (2nd ed.), Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 465: "we should note that Hegel's realization of the distance between his own and the traditional liberal conception of freedom, which he calls "abstract freedom," is clear in his embrace of [[positive freedom]] [in [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prethica.htm#PR149 ''PR'' §149A]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lee Goodfield, [https://books.google.com/books?id=n9vpAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq= ''Hegel and the Metaphysical Frontiers of Political Theory''], Routledge, 2014: "Hegel's collective vision of positive liberty in and through ''[[Sittlichkeit]]'' is reduced to no more than the "mischief" and "mystification" of an amoral, regressive and anti-liberal political vision."&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the Anglophone [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition the distinction between negative and positive liberty was introduced by [[Isaiah Berlin]] in his 1958 lecture "[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]". According to Berlin, the distinction is deeply embedded in the political tradition. In Berlin's words, "liberty in the negative sense involves an answer to the question: 'What is the area within which the subject—a person or group of persons—is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference by other persons'."&lt;ref name="Berlin, I. 1958"&gt;Berlin, I. (1958). "Two Concepts of Liberty." In Isaiah Berlin (1969): ''Four Essays on Liberty''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on negative liberty are imposed by a person, not by natural causes or incapacity.

[[Frankfurt School]] [[psychoanalyst]] and [[humanistic]] [[philosopher]] [[Erich Fromm]] drew a similar distinction between negative and positive freedom in his 1941 work, ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'', that predates Berlin's essay by more than a decade.  Fromm sees the distinction between the two types of freedom emerging alongside humanity's evolution away from the instinctual activity that characterizes lower animal forms.  This aspect of freedom, he argues, "is here used not in its positive sense of 'freedom to' but in its negative sense of 'freedom from', namely freedom from instinctual determination of his actions."&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Fear of Freedom'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd., 1966):26.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Fromm, then, negative freedom marks the beginning of humanity as a species conscious of its own existence free from base instinct.

The distinction between positive and negative liberty is considered specious by some [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] political philosophers, who argue that positive and negative liberty are indistinguishable in practice, or that one cannot exist without the other.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Negative/Positive Liberty]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he is not a socialist nor a Marxist, Berlin argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It follows that a frontier must be drawn between the area of private life and that of public authority. Where it is to be drawn is a matter of argument, indeed of haggling. Men are largely interdependent, and no man's activity is so completely private as never to obstruct the lives of others in any way. 'Freedom for the pike is death for the minnows'; the liberty of some must depend on the restraint of others."&lt;ref name="Berlin, I. 1958"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Libertarian]] thinker [[Tibor Machan]] defends negative liberty as "required for moral choice and, thus, for human flourishing," claiming that it "is secured when the rights of individual members of a human community to life, to voluntary action (or to liberty of conduct), and to property are universally respected, observed, and defended."

== Negative liberty and authority: Hobbes and Locke ==

One might ask, "How is men's desire for liberty to be reconciled with the assumed need for authority?" Its answer by various thinkers provides a fault line for understanding their view on liberty but also a cluster of intersecting concepts such as authority, equality, and justice.

[[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] give two influential and representative solutions to this question. As a starting point, both agree that a line must be drawn and a space sharply delineated where each individual can act unhindered according to their tastes, desires, and inclinations. This zone defines the sacrosanct space of personal liberty. But, they believe no society is possible without some authority, where the intended purpose of authority is to prevent collisions among the different ends and, thereby, to demarcate the boundaries where each person's zone of liberty begins and ends. Where Hobbes and Locke differ is the extent of the zone. Hobbes, who took a rather negative view of human nature, argued that a strong authority was needed to curb men's intrinsically wild, savage, and corrupt impulses. Only a powerful authority can keep at bay the permanent and always looming threat of anarchy. Locke believed, on the other hand, that men on the whole are more good than wicked and, accordingly, the area for individual liberty can be left rather at large.

Locke is a slightly more ambiguous case than Hobbes because although his conception of liberty was largely negative (in terms of non-interference), he differed in that he courted the republican tradition of liberty by rejecting the notion that an individual could be free if he was under the arbitrary power of another:

"This ''freedom'' from absolute, arbitrary power, is so necessary to, and closely joined with a man's preservation, that he cannot part with it, but by what forfeits his preservation and life together: for a man, not having the power of his own life, cannot, by compact, or his own consent, enslave himself to any one, nor put himself under the absolute, arbitrary power of another, to take away his life, when he pleases. No body can give more power than he has himself; and he that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it. Indeed, having by his fault forfeited his own life, by some act that deserves death; he, to whom he has forfeited it, may (when he has him in his power) delay to take it, and make use of him to his own service, and he does him no injury by it: for, whenever he finds the hardship of his slavery outweigh the value of his life, it is in his power, by resisting the will of his master, to draw on himself the death he desires."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr04.htm John Locke: ''Second Treatise of Civil Government'', Chapter 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concrete example ==

This section outlines specific examples of governmental types which follow the concept of negative liberty.

===Monarchy===
Thomas Hobbes' [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']] outlines a commonwealth based upon a monarchy to whom citizens have ceded their rights. The basic reasoning for Hobbes' assertion that this system was most ideal relates more to Hobbes' value of order and simplicity in government. The monarchy provides for its subjects, and its subjects go about their day-to-day lives without interaction with the government:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commonwealth is instituted when all agree in the following manner: ''I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.''

The sovereign has twelve principal rights:

# because a successive covenant cannot override a prior one, the subjects cannot (lawfully) change the form of government.
# because the covenant forming the commonwealth is the subjects giving to the sovereign the right to act for them, the sovereign cannot possibly breach the covenant; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign.
# the selection of sovereign is (in theory) by majority vote; the minority have agreed to abide by this.
# every subject is author of the acts of the sovereign: hence the sovereign cannot injure any of his subjects, and cannot be accused of injustice.
# following this, the sovereign cannot justly be put to death by the subjects.
# because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace, and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord, therefore the sovereign may judge what opinions and doctrines are averse; who shall be allowed to speak to multitudes; and who shall examine the doctrines of all books before they are published.
# to prescribe the rules of civil law and property.
# to be judge in all cases.
# to make war and peace as he sees fit; and to command the army.
# to choose counsellors, ministers, magistrates and officers.
# to reward with riches and honour; or to punish with corporal or pecuniary punishment or ignominy.
# to establish laws of honour and a scale of worth.

Hobbes explicitly rejects the idea of ''Separation of Powers'', in particular the form that would later become the [[separation of powers under the United States Constitution]]. Part 6 is a perhaps under-emphasised feature of Hobbes's argument: his is explicitly in favour of censorship of the press and restrictions on the rights of free speech, should they be considered desirable by the sovereign in order to promote order.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon closer inspection of Hobbes' ''Leviathan'', it becomes clear that Hobbes believed individual people in society must give up liberty to a sovereign. Whether that sovereign is an absolute monarch or other form was left open to debate, however Hobbes himself viewed the absolute monarch as the best of all options. Hobbes himself said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For as amongst masterless men, there is perpetual war, of every man against his neighbour; no inheritance, to transmit to the son, nor to expect from the father; no propriety of goods, or lands; no security; but a full and absolute liberty in every particular man: so in states, and commonwealths not dependent on one another, every commonwealth, not every man, has an absolute liberty, to do what it shall judge, that is to say, what that man, or assembly that representeth it, shall judge most conducing to their benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''The English Works'', vol. III (''Leviathan''). 1651: [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/585/89860 Part 1, Ch. XIX]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From this quote it is clear that Hobbes contended that people in a [[state of nature]] ceded their [[natural rights|individual rights]] to create [[sovereignty]], retained by the state, in return for their protection and a more functional society. In essence, a social contract between the sovereign and citizens evolves out of pragmatic self-interest. Hobbes named the state ''Leviathan'', thus pointing to the artifice involved in the social contract. In this vein, Hobbes' concept of negative liberty was built upon the notion that the state would not act upon its subjects because its subjects had willingly relinquished their liberties.

'''Nickel Leung''' (梁迦傑博士) is a Hong Kong educator. He founded the first etiquette school there. In an interviews, he said, body language is different in places in the world, while [[microexpressions]] are the same across ethnicity and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=ej9QkGGZrX4|title=Dr. Nickel Leung 接受CNN 訪問}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than etiquette, Leung teaches memory and ranked No. 32 at the [[World Memory Championships]] 2006 – UK.

He has been interviewed locally in Hong Kong, Macau, as well as internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=kse_GumCKfU|title=《電視節目有好多種》睇穿呃人偽術}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=g2SKq8Gfn8Q|title=Dr. Leung 接受鳳凰衛視訪問： 完全时尚手册 20111207 食色行野：深秋到威尔士采蘑菇}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topick.hket.com/article/651447/offer5Q-A?r=cpsdfb|title=應該打電話追問offer嗎？見工面試5條Q&amp;A|work=TOPick 話題}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=zV2VFRtVz_M|title=Dr. Nickel Leung 參加《生活朝點》節目： 餐桌禮儀知多D 第一部分}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1736">An '''order unit''' is an element of an [[ordered vector space]] which can be used to bound all elements from above.&lt;ref name="fuchssteiner+lusky"&gt;{{cite book|title=Convex Cones |last1=Fuchssteiner |first1=Benno |last2=Lusky |first2=Wolfgang |isbn=9780444862907 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way (as seen in the first [[#Examples|example]] below) the order unit generalizes the unit element in the reals.

== Definition ==
For the ordering cone &lt;math&gt;K \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; in the [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the element &lt;math&gt;e \in K&lt;/math&gt; is an order unit (more precisely an &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-order unit) if for every &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; there exists a &lt;math&gt;\lambda_x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_x e - x \in K&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;x \leq_K \lambda_x e&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="aliprantis+tourky"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cones and Duality |author=Charalambos D.

=== Equivalent definition ===
The order units of an ordering cone &lt;math&gt;K \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; are those elements in the [[algebraic interior]] of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. given by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{core}(K)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="aliprantis+tourky" /&gt;

== Examples ==
Let &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the real numbers and &lt;math&gt;K = \mathbb{R}_+ = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: x \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, then the unit element &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is an ''order unit''.

Let &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K = \mathbb{R}^n_+ = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: \forall i = 1,\ldots,n: x_i \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, then the unit element &lt;math&gt;\vec{1} = (1,\ldots,1)&lt;/math&gt; is an ''order unit''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26241">The '''particle-in-cell''' ('''PIC''') method refers to a technique used to solve a certain class of [[partial differential equations]].  In this method, individual particles (or fluid elements) in a [[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Lagrangian]] frame are tracked in continuous [[phase space]], whereas moments of the distribution such as densities and currents are computed simultaneously on Eulerian (stationary) [[Mesh (mathematics)|mesh]] points.

PIC methods were already in use as early as 1955,&lt;ref&gt;

even before the first [[Fortran]] compilers were available. The method gained popularity for plasma simulation in the late 1950s and early 1960s by [[Oscar Buneman|Buneman]], [[John M. Dawson|Dawson]], Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others. In [[Plasma (physics)|plasma physics]] applications, the method amounts to following the trajectories of charged particles in self-consistent electromagnetic (or electrostatic) fields computed on a fixed mesh.

== Technical aspects ==

For many types of problems, the classical PIC method invented by Buneman, Dawson, Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others is relatively intuitive and straightforward to implement.  This probably accounts for much of its success, particularly for plasma simulation, for which the method typically includes the following procedures:
* Integration of the equations of motion.
* Interpolation of charge and current source terms to the field mesh.
* Computation of the fields on mesh points.
* Interpolation of the fields from the mesh to the particle locations.

Models which include interactions of particles only through the average fields are called '''PM''' (particle-mesh). Those which include direct binary interactions are '''PP''' (particle-particle). Models with both types of interactions are called '''PP-PM''' or '''P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;M'''.

Since the early days, it has been recognized that the PIC method is susceptible to error from so-called ''discrete particle noise''.
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
This error is statistical in nature, and today it remains less-well understood than for traditional fixed-grid methods, such as [[Numerical partial differential equations|Eulerian]] or [[semi-Lagrangian scheme|semi-Lagrangian]] schemes.

Modern geometric PIC algorithms are based on a very different theoretical framework. These algorithms use tools of discrete manifold, interpolating differential forms, and canonical or non-canonical symplectic integrators to guarantee gauge invariant and conservation of charge, energy-momentum, and more importantly the infinitely dimensional symplectic structure of the particle-field system.

&lt;/ref&gt;
These desired features are attributed to the fact that geometric PIC algorithms are built on the more fundamental field-theoretical framework and are directly linked to the perfect form, i.e., the variational principle of physics.

== Basics of the PIC plasma simulation technique ==

Inside the plasma research community, systems of different species (electrons, ions, neutrals, molecules, dust particles, etc.) are investigated. The set of equations associated with PIC codes are therefore the [[Lorentz force]] as the equation of motion, solved in the so-called ''pusher'' or ''particle mover'' of the code, and [[Maxwell's equations]] determining the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, calculated in the ''(field) solver''.

=== Super-particles ===

The real systems studied are often extremely large in terms of the number of particles they contain. In order to make simulations efficient or at all possible, so-called ''super-particles'' are used. A super-particle (or ''macroparticle'') is a computational particle that represents many real particles; it may be millions of electrons or ions in the case of a plasma simulation, or, for instance, a vortex element in a fluid simulation. It is allowed to rescale the number of particles, because the [[Lorentz force]] depends only on the charge-to-mass ratio, so a super-particle will follow the same trajectory as a real particle would.

The number of real particles corresponding to a super-particle must be chosen such that sufficient statistics can be collected on the particle motion. If there is a significant difference between the density of different species in the system (between ions and neutrals, for instance), separate real to super-particle ratios can be used for them.

=== The particle mover ===

Even with super-particles, the number of simulated particles is usually very large (&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;), and often the particle mover is the most time consuming part of PIC, since it has to be done for each particle separately. Thus, the pusher is required to be of high accuracy and speed and much effort is spent on optimizing the different schemes.

The schemes used for the particle mover can be split into two categories, implicit and explicit solvers. While implicit solvers(e.g. implicit Euler scheme) calculate the particle velocity from the already updated fields, explicit solvers use only the old force from the previous time step, and are therefore simpler and faster, but require a smaller time step. Two frequently used schemes are the [[leapfrog method]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; which are explicit solvers.

For plasma applications, the [[leapfrog method]] takes the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}_{k}}{\Delta t} = \mathbf{v}_{k+1/2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf{v}_{k+1/2} - \mathbf{v}_{k-1/2}}{\Delta t} = \frac{q}{m} \left( \mathbf{E}_k + \frac{\mathbf{v}_{k+1/2} + \mathbf{v}_{k-1/2}}{2} \times \mathbf{B}_{k} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; refers to "old" quantities from the previous time step, &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; to updated quantities from the next time step (i.e. &lt;math&gt;t_{k+1} = t_k + \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;), and velocities are calculated in-between the usual time steps &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt;.

In comparison, the equations of the Boris scheme are:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_{k} + {\Delta t} \mathbf{v}_{k+1/2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{k+1/2} = \mathbf{u}' + q' \mathbf{E}_k,&lt;/math&gt;

with 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}' = \mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{u} + (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{h})) \times \mathbf{s},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{v}_{k-1/2} + q' \mathbf{E}_k,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h} = q' \mathbf{B}_k,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} = 2 \mathbf{h}/(1 + h^2)&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;q' = \Delta t \times (q/2m)&lt;/math&gt;.

Because of its excellent long term accuracy, the Boris algorithm is the de facto standard for advancing a charged particle.  It was realized that the excellent long term accuracy of nonrelativistic Boris algorithm is due to the fact it conserves phase space volume, even though it is not symplectic. The global bound on energy error typically associated with symplectic algorithms still holds for the Boris algorithm, making it an effective algorithm for the multi-scale dynamics of plasmas.  It has also been shown

that one can improve on the relativistic Boris push to make it both volume preserving and have a constant-velocity solution in crossed E and B fields.

=== The field solver ===

The most commonly used methods for solving Maxwell's equations (or more generally, [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE)) belong to one of the following three categories:
* [[Finite difference method]]s (FDM)
* [[Finite element method]]s (FEM)
* [[Spectral method]]s

With the FDM, the continuous domain is replaced with a discrete grid of points, on which the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields are calculated. Derivatives are then approximated with differences between neighboring grid-point values and thus PDEs are turned into algebraic equations.

Using FEM, the continuous domain is divided into a discrete mesh of elements. The PDEs are treated as an [[eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalue problem]] and initially a trial solution is calculated using [[basis function]]s that are localized in each element. The final solution is then obtained by optimization until the required accuracy is reached.

Also spectral methods, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT), transform the PDEs into an eigenvalue problem, but this time the basis functions are high order and defined globally over the whole domain. The domain itself is not discretized in this case, it remains continuous. Again, a trial solution is found by inserting the basis functions into the eigenvalue equation and then optimized to determine the best values of the initial trial parameters.

=== Particle and field weighting ===

The name "particle-in-cell" originates in the way that plasma macro-quantities ([[number density]], [[current density]], etc.) are assigned to simulation particles (i.e., the ''particle weighting''). Particles can be situated anywhere on the continuous domain, but macro-quantities are calculated only on the mesh points, just as the fields are. To obtain the macro-quantities, one assumes that the particles have a given "shape" determined by the shape function
:&lt;math&gt;S(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{X}),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate of the particle and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; the observation point. Perhaps the easiest and most used choice for the shape function is the so-called ''cloud-in-cell'' (CIC) scheme, which is a first order (linear) weighting scheme. Whatever the scheme is, the shape function has to satisfy the following conditions:
&lt;ref name=Fehske&gt;{{cite book

| chapter = Chapter 6: The Particle-in-Cell Method
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
space isotropy, charge conservation, and increasing accuracy (convergence) for higher-order terms.

The fields obtained from the field solver are determined only on the grid points and can't be used directly in the particle mover to calculate the force acting on particles, but have to be interpolated via the ''field weighting'':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i}\mathbf{E}_i S(\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}),&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; labels the grid point. To ensure that the forces acting on particles are self-consistently obtained, the way of calculating macro-quantities from particle positions on the grid points and interpolating fields from grid points to particle positions has to be consistent, too, since they both appear in [[Maxwell's equations]]. Above all, the field interpolation scheme should conserve [[momentum]]. This can be achieved by choosing the same weighting scheme for particles and fields and by ensuring the appropriate space symmetry (i.e. no self-force and fulfilling the [[Newton's laws of motion|action-reaction law]]) of the field solver at the same time&lt;ref name="Fehske"/&gt;

=== Collisions ===

As the field solver is required to be free of self-forces, inside a cell the field generated by a particle must decrease with decreasing distance from the particle, and hence inter-particle forces inside the cells are underestimated. This can be balanced with the aid of [[Coulomb collision]]s between charged particles. Simulating the interaction for every pair of a big system would be computationally too expensive, so several [[Monte Carlo method]]s have been developed instead. A widely used method is the ''binary collision model'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a real plasma, many other reactions may play a role, ranging from elastic collisions, such as collisions between charged and neutral particles, over inelastic collisions, such as electron-neutral ionization collision, to chemical reactions; each of them requiring separate treatment. Most of the collision models handling charged-neutral collisions use either the ''direct Monte-Carlo'' scheme, in which all particles carry information about their collision probability, or the ''null-collision'' scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Accuracy and stability conditions ===

As in every simulation method, also in PIC, the time step and the grid size must be well chosen, so that the time and length scale phenomena of interest are properly resolved in the problem. In addition, time step and grid size affect the speed and accuracy of the code.

For an electrostatic plasma simulation using an explicit time integration scheme (e.g. leapfrog, which is most commonly used), two important conditions regarding the grid size &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; and the time step &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; should be fulfilled in order to ensure the stability of the solution:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x &lt; 3.4 \lambda_D,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t \leq 2 \omega_{pe}^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

which can be derived considering the harmonic oscillations of a one-dimensional unmagnetized plasma. The latter conditions is strictly required but practical considerations related to energy conservation suggest to use a much stricter constraint where the factor 2 is replaced by a number one order of magnitude smaller. The use of &lt;math&gt;\Delta t \leq 0.1 \omega_{pe}^{-1},&lt;/math&gt; is typical.&lt;ref name=Fehske/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

For an explicit electromagnetic plasma simulation, the time step must also satisfy the [[Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition|CFL condition]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t &lt; \Delta x / c ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta x \sim \lambda_D&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light.

== Applications ==

Within plasma physics, PIC simulation has been used successfully to study laser-plasma interactions, electron acceleration and ion heating in the auroral [[ionosphere]], [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[magnetic reconnection]], as well as ion-temperature-gradient and other microinstabilities in [[tokamak]]s, furthermore [[vacuum arc|vacuum discharges]], and [[dusty plasma]]s.

Hybrid models may use the PIC method for the kinetic treatment of some species, while other species (that are [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]) are simulated with a fluid model.

PIC simulations have also been applied outside of plasma physics to problems in [[solid mechanics|solid]] and [[fluid mechanics]].

[[File:Man pilos Louvre MNE1330.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Red figure pottery|red-figure]] plate from [[Apulia]], third quarter of the 4th century BC, [[Louvre]] ]]

The '''pileus''' ({{Lang-gr|πῖλος}} – ''pilos'', also '''pilleus''' or '''pilleum''' in [[Latin]]) was a brimless, [[felt]] cap worn in [[Ancient Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460407/pileus Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; and surrounding regions, later also introduced in [[Ancient Rome]]. The Greek {{lang|grc|πιλίδιον}} (''pilidion'') and Latin ''pilleolus'' were smaller versions, similar to a skullcap.

==History==
[[File:Peasant basket Louvre Myr330.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ancient Greek]] terracotta statuette of a peasant wearing a pilos, 1st century BC]]

===Greece===
The '''''pilos''''' (Greek: πῖλος, ''felt''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpi%3Dlos2 πῖλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) was a common conical travelling hat in [[Illyria]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. The pilos is the brimless version of the ''[[petasos]]''. It could be made of felt or leather. Pilos caps often identify the mythical twins, or [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux]], as represented in sculptures, bas-reliefs and on ancient ceramics. Their caps were supposedly the remnants of the egg from which they hatched.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron'', noted by [[Karl Kerenyi]]'s ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959:107 note 584.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilos appears on [[Votive object|votive figurines]] of boys at the sanctuary of the [[Cabeiri]] at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], the ''Cabeirion''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]]. ''Greek Religion'', 1985:281.&lt;/ref&gt;

In warfare, the pilos type helmet was often worn by the [[peltast]] light infantry, in conjunction with the [[exomis]], but it was also worn by the heavy infantry.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}}

The '''pilos helmet''' was made of bronze in the same shape as the pilos which was presumably sometimes worn under the helmet for comfort, giving rise to the helmet's conical shape.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Sekunda,''The Spartan Army'', p.30&lt;/ref&gt; The first widespread adoption of the pilos helmet occurred in Sparta towards the end of the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Obert, ''A Brief History of Greek Helmets'', p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome===
[[File:Eid Mar.jpg|thumb|left|Pileus between two daggers, on the [[obverse|reverse]] of a [[denarius]] issued by [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] to commemorate the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]] on the [[Ides of March]]]]
In Ancient Rome, a slave was freed in a ceremony in which a [[praetor]] touched the slave with a rod called a ''vindicta'' and pronounced him to be free. The slave's head was shaved and a pileus was placed upon it. Both the ''vindicta'' and the cap were considered symbols of [[Libertas]], the goddess representing liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobb|first=T.R.R.|authorlink=Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb|page=285, 285n2|title=An inquiry into the law of Negro slavery in the United States of America|place=Philadelphia|year=1858|publisher=T. &amp; J.W. Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a form of extra-legal manumission (the ''manumissio minus justa'') considered less legally sound than manumission in a court of law.{{cn|date=March 2013}}

One 19th century dictionary of classical antiquity states that, "Among the Romans the cap of felt was the emblem of liberty. When a slave obtained his freedom he had his head shaved, and wore instead of his hair an undyed pileus."&lt;ref&gt;πίλεον λευκόν, [[Diodorus Siculus]] Exc. Leg. 22 p. 625, ed. Wess.; [[Plautus|Plaut.]] Amphit. I.1.306; [[Persius]], V.82&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the phrase ''servos ad pileum vocare'' is a summons to liberty, by which slaves were frequently called upon to take up arms with a promise of liberty ([[Livy|Liv.]] XXIV.32). The figure of Liberty on some of the coins of [[Antoninus Pius]], struck A.D. 145, holds this cap in the right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, James. Entry "Pileus" in William Smith's ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' ([[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], London, 1875).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
Jewish priests wore a ''pilos'' (conical cap), mentioned in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Exodus|28:40|HE}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Costume |volume=7 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 [[UNICEF]] report covering 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East, [[Ethiopia]] had the region's highest total number of women that have undergone FGM (27.2 million), while [[Somalia]] had the highest percentage ([[prevalence]]) of FGM (98%).&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt;

The world's first known campaign against FGM took place in Egypt in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; FGM prevalence in Egypt in 1995 was still at least as high as Somalia's 2013 world record (98%), despite dropping significantly since then among young women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/brussels/en/home/ourwork/sustainable-development/successstories/the-taboo-has-been-broken--fighting-female-genital-mutilation-in.html The taboo has been broken: Fighting Female Genital Mutilation in Egypt]. According to this UNDP report, FGM prevalence among 15 to 30-year-olds dropped to 72% already in 2008 after having been 96% in 1995, which means that the prevalence among all women in 1995 was even higher than 76%.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the prevalence of FGM vary according to source.

==Classifications of FGM==
{{main|Female genital mutilation}}
The WHO identifies four types of FGM:
*'''Type I''': removal of the [[clitoral hood]], the skin around the [[clitoris]] (''Ia''), with partial or complete removal of the clitoris (''Ib'');
*'''Type II''': removal of the [[labia minora]] (''IIa''), with partial or complete removal of the clitoris (''IIb'') and the [[labia majora]] (''IIc'');

The term "[[prevalence]]" is used to describe the proportion of women and girls now living in a country who have undergone FGM at some stage in their lives. This is distinct from the "[[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]" of FGM which describes the proportion of women and girls who have undergone the procedure within a particular time period, which could be contemporary or historical.

In a 2013 UNICEF report based on surveys completed by select countries, FGM is known to be prevalent in 27 African countries, Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan, where 125 million women and girls have undergone FGM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], pp. 3–26. *For Iraqi Kurdistan, also see Yasin, Berivan A. et al.

As a result of immigration, FGM has also spread to Europe, Australia, and the United States, with some families having their daughters undergo the procedure while on vacation overseas. As Western governments become more aware of FGM, legislation has come into effect in many countries to make the practice a criminal offense. In 2006, [[Khalid Adem]] became the first man in the United States to be prosecuted for mutilating his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/us/02brfs-001.html?_r=1 "Georgia: Man Convicted in Daughter’s Mutilation"], Associated Press, 2 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] has called for elimination of the practice by 2030. A 2017 [[UCLA Fielding School of Public Health]] study, measuring trends in the prevalence of FGM over the course of three decades, found that they dropped significantly in 17 of the 22 countries surveyed. The researchers found a 2–8 percentage points increase in Chad, Mali and Sierra Leone during the 30-years period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Koski |first1=Alissa |last2=Heymann |first2=Jody |date=25 November 2017 |title=Thirty-year trends in the prevalence and severity of female genital mutilation: a comparison of 22 countries |url=http://gh.bmj.com/content/2/4/e000467 |journal=BMJ Global Health |publisher=BMJ Journals |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e000467 |accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data reliability==
Much of the FGM prevalence data currently available is based on verbal surveys and self-reporting.&lt;ref name=b2013&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1155/2013/680926 | volume=2013 | title=Female Genital Mutilation in Sierra Leone: Forms, Reliability of Reported Status, and Accuracy of Related Demographic and Health Survey Questions | year=2013 | journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology International | pages=1–14 | author=Bjälkander Owolabi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical examinations are uncommon. The assumption is that women respond truthfully when asked about their FGM status and that they know the type and extent of FGM that was performed on their genitalia. Many FGM procedures are performed at a very young age, many cultures feel a taboo about such discussions, and a number of such factors raise the possibility that the validity of survey responses might be incorrect, potentially underreported.&lt;ref name=b2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Rahman and N. Toubia, Female Genital Mutilation: A Guide to Worldwide Laws and Policies, Zed Press, London, UK, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Oman]], for example, some do not wish to discuss FGM from the fear that such discussion is showing their culture's dirty laundry to the world, causing criticism of a practice that they believe is purely religious.&lt;ref name="muscatdaily.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160307034607/http://www.muscatdaily.com/Archive/Stories-Files/The-issue-of-female-genital-mutilation-in-Oman-1xye The issue of female genital mutilation in Oman] Susan Mubarak, Muscat Daily (January 01, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries where FGM has been outlawed, fear of prosecution of family members or self, and social disapproval from elders may cause women to deny that they underwent or were subjected to FGM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1475-9276-10-20 | volume=10 | title=Factors associated with female genital mutilation in Burkina Faso and its policy implications | year=2011 | journal=International Journal for Equity in Health | page=20 | author=Karmaker Bue, Kandala Ngianga-Bakwin, Chung Donna, Clarke Aileen}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the self-reported circumcision status of women aged 15–49 was verbally surveyed in 1995 in northern Ghana. The same women were interviewed again in 2000 after the enactment of a law that criminalized FGM and Ghana-wide public campaigns against the practice. This study discovered that 13% of women who reported in 1995 that they had undergone FGM denied it in the 2000 interview, with youngest age group girls denying at rates as high as 50%.&lt;ref&gt;E.

{{further|Maputo Protocol}}
In July 2003, at its second summit, the [[African Union]] adopted the Maputo Protocol promoting women's rights and calling for an end to FGM.

Although estimates of the prevalence of FGM vary, sources have consistently found the practice to be undergone by the majority of women in the [[Horn of Africa]], in the [[West Africa]]n countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Mauritania, Mali and Burkina Faso, as well as in Sudan and Egypt.
Of these countries, all have laws or decrees against the practice, with the exception of Sierra Leone, Mali and some states of Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf|title=Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change - UNICEF DATA|date=22 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-34921135|title=Gambia's Yahya Jammeh bans female genital mutilation|date=25 November 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egypt]]'s [[Ministry of Health and Population (Egypt)|Ministry of Health and Population]] has banned all forms of female genital mutilation since 2007.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt; The ministry's order declared it is 'prohibited for any doctors, nurses, or any other person to carry out any cut of, flattening or modification of any natural part of the female reproductive system'. Islamic authorities in the nation also stressed that Islam opposes female genital mutilation. The Grand Mufti of Egypt, [[Ali Gomaa]], said that it is "Prohibited, prohibited, prohibited."&lt;ref name = "badour shaker"&gt;Michael, Maggie.

Gambia's predominant religion is Islam (90%), and it has many ethnic groups. Prevalence rates of FGM/C vary significantly between the ethnic groups: Sarahule (FGM rate of 98%), Mandinka (97%), Djola (87%), Serer (43%), and Wolof (12%). Urban areas report FGM/C rates of about 56%, whereas in rural areas, rates exceed 90%. A majority of Gambian women who underwent FGM/C claimed they did it primarily because religion mandates it.&lt;ref name=kapgh/&gt;

===Ghana===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="ecoi" /&gt; According to the WHO, its prevalence is 3.8%. In 1989, the head of the government of Ghana, President Rawlings, issued a formal declaration against FGM. Article 39 of Ghana's Constitution also provides in part that traditional practices that are injurious to a person's health and well being are abolished. The Criminal Code was amended in 1994 to outlaw FGM, and the law was strengthened in 2007.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; Ghana ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2007.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt;

Among the 15- to 19-year-olds the prevalence was 89%, among 20- to 24-year-olds 95%. About 50% of the women in Guinea believe FGM is a religious requirement.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; Guinea is predominantly a Muslim country, with 90% of the population practicing Islam.

FGM is illegal in Guinea under Article 265 of the Penal Code. The law sentences death to the perpetrator if the girl dies within 40 days after the FGM.&lt;ref name=unlaw09&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw_legislation_2009/Expert%20Paper%20EGMGPLHP%20_Berhane%20Ras-Work%20revised_.pdf LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION (FGM)] Berhane Ras-Work, United Nations (May 21, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Article 6 of the Guinean Constitution, which outlaws cruel and inhumane treatment, could be interpreted to include these practices, should a case be brought to the Supreme Court. Guinea signed the Maputo Protocol in 2003 but has not ratified it.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt; 

Article 305 of Guinea’s penal code also bans FGM, but nobody has yet been sentenced under any of Guinea's FGM-related laws.&lt;ref name=fgmgui2011/&gt; In Guinea, instead of stopping FGM, the trend is towards medicalisation of FGM, where the mutilation is advertised under hygienic conditions by medically trained staff, who see FGM practice an additional source of income. Per the above 2005 survey, 27% of girls were cut by medically trained staff.

===Guinea-Bissau===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Guinea-Bissau]], and have been estimated at a 50% prevalence rate in 2000.&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; A law banning the practice nationwide was adopted by Parliament in June 2011 with 64 votes to 1. At the time, 45% of women aged 15 to 49 years were affected by FGM. According to a survey, 33% of women favoured a continuation of genital cutting, but 50% of the overall population wanted to abandon the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/guineabissau_59787.html |title=New law prohibits practice of female genital mutilation in Guinea-Bissau &amp;#124; At a glance: Guinea-Bissau |publisher=UNICEF |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenya===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; The 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) estimated the national prevalence of FGM to be 21% among women age 15-49, down from 27% in the 2008/09 survey and 32 percent in the 2003 survey.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR308/FR308.pdf|title=Kenya DHS 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of FGM in 2014 varied widely by age, location, ethnic group, and religion. Prevalence of FGM increases with age. It is lowest among women ages 15–19 at 11.4%, and highest among women aged 45–49 at 40.9%. This trend underscores the declining trend in FGM over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

By region, prevalence is highest in the former provinces of North Eastern (97.5%), Nyanza (32.4%), Rift Valley (26.9%), and Eastern (26.4%), and lower in Central (16.5%), Coast (10.2%), Nairobi (8.0%), and Western (0.8%). It is more common in rural areas (25.9%) than urban (13.8%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By ethnic group, FGM is most prevalent among women in the Somali (93.6%), Samburu (86.0%), Kisii (84.4%), and Maasai (77.9%) ethnic groups. By religion, it is more prevalent in Muslim women (51.1%) and women listing no religion (32.9%) and less prevalent in Roman Catholic (21.5%) and Protestant or other Christian women (17.9%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2001 Kenya enacted the Children’s Act, under the provisions of which FGM was criminalized when practiced on girls younger than 18.&lt;ref name="fgmken2011"&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-kenia-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Kenya] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was made illegal nationwide in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/sarah-boseley-global-health/2011/sep/08/women-africa "FGM: Kenya acts against unkindest cut"], The Guardian, 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberia===
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; Genital mutilation is a taboo subject in Liberia. It is difficult to get accurate data on FGM prevalence rate. The FGM procedure is mandatory for initiation of women into the secret Liberia and Sierra Leone society called the [[Sande society]], sometimes called Bondo. A 2007 demographic survey asked women if they belonged to Sande society. It was assumed that those who were part of Sande society had undergone FGM. Based on this estimation method, the prevalence of FGM in Liberia has been estimated as 58%.&lt;ref name=fgmlib2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-liberia-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Liberia] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Liberia has consented to international charters such as CEDAW as well as Africa's Maputo Protocol. National legislation explicitly making FGM punishable by law has yet to be passed.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;&lt;ref name=fgmlib2011/&gt; As FGM was less prevalent among younger women in a 2015 study, this suggested a decline in the practice.&lt;ref name="CUL_Prevalence_FGM_Jul2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alison MacFarlane et al|title=Prevalence of Female Genital Mutilation in England and Wales: National and local estimates|date=July 2015|publisher=[[City University London]]|location=London|isbn=9781900804936|page=10|url=https://www.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/282388/FGM-statistics-final-report-21-07-15-released-text.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121004826/https://www.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/282388/FGM-statistics-final-report-21-07-15-released-text.pdf|archivedate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libya===
Female genital mutilation is rarely practiced in Libya. Likely to be found in rural areas.&lt;ref name="ecoi"/&gt;

===Malawi===
Female genital mutilation is practiced in Malawi mostly in the following districts of Malawi. Southern Malawi: Mulanje, Thyolo, Mangochi and parts of Machinga and Chiradzuro District. In the Northern part of Malawi: Nkhatabay. This custom is common among the Tonga tribe, Yao tribe and Lomwe tribe. It is a custom which has been there for generation. In some villages it is deeply routed compared to others . Every FGM camp has its own degree of how deep they want to conduct the custom but the motive is the same. It is shrouded in silence. Not even the government authorities can trace the roots because the high powers are given to the local authorities of the village and clan.&lt;ref name="ecoi" /&gt;

===Mali===
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Mali]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; The WHO gives a prevalence of 85.2% for women aged 15–49 in 2006 in Mali.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; In a 2007 report,&lt;ref name=fgmmali2007/&gt; 92% of all Mali women between the ages of 15 and 49 had been subjected to FGM. The rates of FGM are lower only among the Sonrai (28%), the Tamachek (32%) and the Bozo people (76%). Nearly half are Type I, another half Type II.&lt;ref name=fgmmali2007&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/en/dokumente/en-fgm-countries-mali.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Mali] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence varies with religion in Mali; FGM is prevalent in 92% of Muslim women, 76% of Christians.&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010/&gt; 

About 64% of the women of Mali believe FGM is a religious requirement.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; In 2002, Mali created a government program aimed at discouraging FGM (''Ordinance No. 02-053 portant creation du programme national de lutte contre la pratique de l’excision'' [Ordinance creating a National Program to Fight the Practice of Female Genital Mutilation]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.k4health.org/sites/default/files/pub_bo_GG_appendA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There is no specific legislation criminalizing FGM.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;&lt;ref name=fgmmali2007/&gt;

===Mauritania===
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; According to 2001 survey, 71% of all women aged between 15 and 49 had undergone FGM. A 2007 demographic cluster study found no change in FGM prevalence rate in Mauritania.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;&lt;ref name=fgmmau2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-mauritania-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Mauritania] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003050515/http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-mauritania-2011.pdf |date=2013-10-03 }} Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Type II FGM is most frequent.

===Niger===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Niger]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; In a 2006 survey, about 2% of Niger women had undergone FGM/C.&lt;ref name="Female Genetic Mutilation/Cutting"/&gt; In 1998, Niger reported a 4.5% prevalence rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glow-boell.de/media/de/txt_rubrik_2/FGM_Statistic_UNICEF_2005.pdf FGM/C - 2005 Statistics] UNICEF, see page 32&lt;/ref&gt; This survey data is potentially incorrect because, adjusted for age group, the women who claimed to have experienced FGM at the previous survey still are, albeit in a different age group. The 2006 survey implies more women had never experienced FGM than previously reported. The DHS surveyors claim the adoption of criminal legislation and fear of prosecution may explain why Niger women did not want to report having ever been circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/FR193/FR193-NI06.pdf Enquête Démographique et de Santé et à Indicateurs Multiples 2006] RÉPUBLIQUE DU NIGER; page 281 (in French, use an internet translator if you are not fluent in French)&lt;/ref&gt;  A WHO report estimates the prevalence rate of FGM in Niger to be 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apps.who.int/dsa/cat98/fgmbook.htm Female Genital Mutilation: An overview] WHO, Geneva&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, including a UNICEF 2009 report, claim FGM rates are high in Niger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/niger_49292.html Ten villages unite to say 'no’ to female genital mutilation/cutting in Niger] UNICEF (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engenderhealth.org/files/pubs/maternal-health/report/section/niger.pdf NIGER] Nathalie Maulet, UNFPA (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/printreport.aspx?reportid=48483 NIGER: Legal ban on female circumcision widely ignored] IRIN, UN News Service (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; A law banning FGM was passed in 2003 by the Niger government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/wcaro/WCARO_Niger_Factsheet-11.pdf PRIORITIES IN CHILD SURVIVAL, EDUCATION AND PROTECTION - Niger] UNICEF (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
{{Main|Female genital mutilation in Nigeria}}
A 2008 demographic survey found 30% of all [[Nigeria]]n women have been subjected to FGM.&lt;ref name="fgmnigeria2011"&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-nigeria-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Nigeria] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with 25% reported by a 1999 survey, and 19% by 2003 survey. This suggests no trend, unreliable past or most recent survey data in some regions, as well as the possibility that a number of women are increasingly willing to acknowledge having undergone FGM. Another possible explanation for higher 2008 prevalence rate is the definition of FGM used, which included Type IV FGMs. In some parts of Nigeria, the vagina walls are cut in new born girls or other traditional practices performed - such as the ''angurya'' and ''gishiri'' cuts - which fall under Type IV FGM classification of the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="fgmnigeria2011" /&gt; Over 80% of all FGMs are performed on girls under one year of age. The prevalence varies with religion in Nigeria; FGM is prevalent in 31% of Catholics, 27% of Protestant and 7% of Muslim women.&lt;ref name="unicefstat2010" /&gt; FGM was banned throughout the country in 2015.&lt;ref name="theguardian1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters1" /&gt;

===Republic of the Congo===
Female genital mutilation is practiced in the [[Republic of the Congo]],&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; and has been estimated at a 5% prevalence rate.&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt;

===Senegal===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[Senegal]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; According to 2005 survey, FGM prevalence rate is 28% of all women aged between 15 and 49.&lt;ref name=fgmsen2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-senegal-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Senegal] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; There are significant differences in regional prevalence. FGM is most widespread in the Southern Senegal (94% in Kolda Region) and in Northeastern Senegal (93% in Matam Region). FGM rates are lower in other regions: Tambacounda (86%), Ziguinchor (69%), and less than 5% in Diourbel and Louga Regions. Senegal is 94% Muslim. The FGM prevalence rate varies by religion: 29% of Muslim women have undergone FGM, 16% of Animists, and 11% of Christian women.&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=fgmsen2011/&gt; 

A law that was passed in January 1999 makes FGM illegal in Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/wi/rls/rep/crfgm/10107.htm "Senegal: Report on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) or Female Genital Cutting (FGC)"], Released by the Office of the Senior Coordinator for International Women's Issues, US Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; President Diouf had appealed for an end to this practice and for legislation outlawing it. The law modifies the Penal Code to make this practice a criminal act, punishable by a sentence of one to five years in prison. A spokesperson for the human rights group RADDHO (The African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights) noted in the local press that "Adopting the law is not the end, as it will still need to be effectively enforced for women to benefit from it. Senegal ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2005.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt;

===Sierra Leone===
Female genital mutilation is prevalent in [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; According to a 2008 survey, 91% of women in Sierra Leone between the ages of 15 and 49 have undergone FGM. The highest rate of prevalence is in the Northern Sierra Leone (97%).&lt;ref name=fgmsile2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-sierraleone-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Sierra Leone] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Type II is most common, but Type I is known as well as Type III. In a 2013 report, researchers first conducted verbal surveys followed by clinical examination. They found that the verbal disclosure were not completely reliable, and clinical examination showed greater extent of FGM. These researchers report 68% Type II and 32% Type I in Sierra Leone women.&lt;ref name="b2013"/&gt; 

Like Liberia, Sierra Leone has the traditional secret society of women, called Bondo or [[Sande society]], which uses FGM as part of the initiation rite. 70% of the population is Muslim, 20% Christian, and 10% as traditional religions.&lt;ref name=fgmsile2011/&gt; Only Creole Christians of Sierra Leone are known to not practice FGM. There is no federal law against FGM in Sierra Leone; and the ''Soweis'' - those who do FGM excision - wield considerable political power during elections.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;

===Somalia===
According to a 2005 WHO estimate, about 97.9% of [[Somalia]]'s women and girls underwent FGM. This was at the time the world's highest prevalence rate of the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/index.html |title=Prevalence of FGM |publisher=Who.int |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 UNICEF report also noted that Somalia had the world's highest rate of Type III FGM, with 79% of all Somali women having undergone the procedure; another 15% underwent Type II FGM.&lt;ref name="prb.org"/&gt; The prevalence rate varies considerably by region and is on the decline in the northern part of the country. In 2013, UNICEF in conjunction with the Somali authorities reported that the FGM prevalence rate among 1- to 14-year-old girls in the autonomous northern [[Puntland]] and [[Somaliland]] regions had dropped to 25% following a social and religious awareness campaign.&lt;ref name="Jpsfgmd"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Female genital mutilation down|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/04/16/somalia-female-genital-mutilation-down.html|accessdate=17 May 2013|newspaper=Associated Press via The Jakarta Post|date=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 15 of the [[Constitution of Somalia|Federal Constitution]] adopted in August 2012 also prohibits female circumcision.&lt;ref name="Frspc"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Federal Republic of Somalia - Provisional Constitution |url=http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf |accessdate=13 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228121925/http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/news/Aug_12/Somalia_Constitution_English_FOR_WEB.pdf |archivedate=28 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="ecoi" /&gt;

===South Sudan===
Female genital mutilation is present in [[South Sudan]], but its exact prevalence is unknown. A 2015 UNICEF report claimed 1% of women aged 15–49 had been subjected to FGM, but as of May 2018 there were no recent data confirming this figure. FGM has been reported to be practiced in some Christian and Muslims communities, and has been noted in some refugee camps in [[Upper Nile State]]. South Sudanese law has banned female genital mutilation, but the government has not enacted a clear plan to eradicate the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.28toomany.org/static/media/uploads/Law%20Reports/south_sudan_law_report_v1_(may_2018).pdf |title=South Sudan: the law and FGM |author= |work=28 Too Many 2018 |publisher=Thomas Reuters Foundation |date=May 2018 |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sudan===
The prevalence of FGM in Sudan is 90%.&lt;ref name="applications.emro.who.int"&gt;http://applications.emro.who.int/docs/High_Level_Exp_Meet_Rep_2013_EN_14808.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Only some [[states of Sudan]] have laws against FGM;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prb.org/pdf14/progress-ending-fgm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; currently there is no national law forbidding FGM, although Sudan was the first country to outlaw it in 1946, under the British. Type III was prohibited under the 1925 Penal Code, with less severe forms allowed. Outreach groups have been trying to eradicate the practice for 50 years, working with NGOs, religious groups, the government, the media and medical practitioners. Arrests have been made but no further action seems to have taken place.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt; Sudan signed the Maputo Protocol in June, 2008 but no ratification has yet been deposited with the African Union.

===Tanzania===
According to 2015-16 survey in [[Tanzania]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; FGM prevalence rate is 10% of all women aged between 15 and 49 and 4.7% for those aged 15–19. In contrast, the 1996 survey reported 17.6, suggesting a drop of 7.6% over 20 years or unwillingness to disclose. Type II FGM was found to be most common. There are significant differences in regional prevalence; FGM is most widespread in Manyara (81%), Dodoma (68%), Arusha (55%), Singida (43%) and Mara (38%) regions.&lt;ref name=fgmtanz2011&gt;[http://www.giz.de/Themen/de/dokumente/giz-fgm-EN-tansania-2011.pdf Female Genital Mutilation in Tanzania] Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The practice varies with religion, with reported prevalence rates of 20% for Christian and 15% of Muslim women.&lt;ref name=unicefstat2010/&gt; 

Section 169A of the Sexual Offences Special Provisions Act of 1998 prohibits FGM in Tanzania. Punishment is imprisonment of from five to fifteen years or a fine not exceeding 300,000 shillings (approximately US$250) or both. Tanzania ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2007. As with Kenya, Tanzania 1998 Act protects only girls up to the age of 18 years. The FGM law is being occasionally implemented, with 52 violations have been reported, filed and prosecuted. At least 10 cases were convicted in Tanzania.&lt;ref name=unlaw09/&gt;

===Togo===
Female genital mutilation is practiced in [[Togo]]. In a 2014 UNICEF report, the prevalence is 1.8% in girls 15-19.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; The WHO puts its prevalence at 5.8% in 2006.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; Other sources cite 12%&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and 50%&lt;ref name="brighamandwomens1"/&gt; as prevalence. Type II is usually practiced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; On October 30, 1998, the National Assembly unanimously voted to outlaw the practice of FGM. Penalties under the law can include a prison term of two months to ten years and a fine of 100,000 francs to one million francs (approximately US$160 to 1,600). A person who had knowledge that the procedure was going to take place and failed to inform public authorities can be punished with one month to one year imprisonment or a fine of from 20,000 to 500,000 francs (approximately US$32 to 800). Togo ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2005.&lt;ref name=USStateDep/&gt;

===Italy===
After a few cases of infibulation practiced by complaisant medical practitioners within the African immigrant community came to public knowledge through media coverage, the Law n°7/2006 was passed on 1/9/2006, becoming effective on 1/28/2006, concerning "Measures of prevention and prohibition of any female genital mutilation practice"; the Act is also known as the ''Legge Consolo'' ("Consolo Act") named after its primary promoter, Senator Giuseppe Consolo. Article 6 of the law integrates the Italian Penal Code with Articles 583-''Bis'' and 583-''Ter'', punishing any practice of female genital mutilation "not justifiable under therapeutical or medical needs" with imprisonment ranging from 4 to 12 years (3 to 7 years for any mutilation other than, or less severe than, clitoridectomy, excision or infibulation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlamento.it/leggi/06007l.htm Italian Law n°7 1/9/2006, ''Disposizioni concernenti la prevenzione e il divieto delle pratiche di mutilazione genitale femminile''], accessed 23 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalty can be reduced up to {{frac|2|3}} if the harm caused is of modest entity (i.e. if partially or completely unsuccessful), but may also be elevated up to {{frac|3}} if the victim is a minor or if the offense has been committed for profit. An Italian citizen or a foreign citizen legally resident in Italy can be punished under this law even if the offense is committed abroad; the law will as well afflict any individual of any citizenship in Italy, even illegally or provisionally. The law also mandates any medical practitioner found guilty under those provisions to have his/her medical license revoked for a minimum of six up to a maximum of ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlamento.it/leggi/06007l.htm Italian Law n°7 1/9/2006, ''Disposizioni concernenti la prevenzione e il divieto delle pratiche di mutilazione genitale femminile''], accessed 23 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
FGM is considered mutilation and is punishable as a criminal offense under Dutch law. There is no specific law against FGM: the act is subsumed under the general offense of inflicting harm (''"mishandeling"'' in Dutch, art. 300–304 Dutch Criminal Code). The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of 12 years. The sentence can be higher if the offender is a family member of the victim. It is also illegal to assist or encourage another person to perform FGM. A Dutch citizen or a foreign citizen legally resident in the Netherlands can be punished even if the offense is committed abroad. Doctors have the obligation to report suspected cases of FGM and may break patient confidentiality rules if necessary.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Iran ===
National data on FGM in Iran are unknown. Various studies have been conducted on prevalence in provinces and counties, suggesting significant regional differences.&lt;ref name="OrchidIran"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://orchidproject.org/country/iran/ |title=Iran  |publisher=[[Orchid Project]] |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kameelahmady.com/wp-content/uploads/Kameel%20-%20EN%20Final.pdf |title=A comprehensive research study on female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) in Iran |author=Kameel Ahmady |publisher=Kameel Ahmady |date=2015 |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; FGM is known to be prevalent in four provinces: [[West Azerbaijan Province]] (mostly the Kurdish populated southern part), [[Kurdistan Province]] and [[Kermanshah Province]] in the Kurdish-dominated northwest, and [[Hormozgan Province]] and islands near it in the south.&lt;ref name="Ahmady20"&gt;Ahmady (2015), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

FGM in Iran is primarily associated with Sunni Muslims following the [[Shafi‘i]] [[madhhab]], especially those living in certain Kurdish-populated rural areas in northwestern Iran, adjacent to the Kurdish-speaking regions in northeastern Iraq where FGM also has a relatively high presence compared to the non-Kurdish areas around it. There is strong disparity even within the Kurdish communities, and the prevalence may differ considerably from one village to the next.&lt;ref name="Ahmady14"&gt;Ahmady (2015), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] government, which has implemented a relatively successful anti-FGM campaign, official representatives as well as nationalist individuals or groups tend to deny FGM even exists in Iran.&lt;ref name="Ahmady14"/&gt; In the southern province of Hormozgan, FGM is mostly practiced by (Persian) Sunnis, but also a small minority of Shias living near them.&lt;ref name="Ahmady20"/&gt;

The issue is rarely discussed in public; the national Shia religious establishment claims it as an exclusively Sunni practice in which it should not get involved, and generally sees no reason to try and end it. It is also rarely the subject of research in academia, with the government neither permitting nor funding any public engagement projects for the affected regions.&lt;ref name="Ahmady15"&gt;Ahmady (2015), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordan===
Residents of [[Arabah|Wadi Araba]] village in southern [[Jordan]] are known to practice FGM. The practice is foreign to the rest of the country, experts speculate that this practise was introduced through descendants of tribes that came from neighbouring [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[Beer Sheba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Arts/Nov/13/The-Jordanian-town-that-still-circumcises-women.ashx#axzz2g5h5CT28 The Jordanian town that still circumcises women] Rana Sabbagh-Gargour, The Star (Lebanon)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/femalecircumcision/femalecirc_1.shtml Female circumcision/genital cutting] BBC Guide, United Kingdom (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oman===
The practice is very prevalent in [[Oman]].&lt;ref name="meforum1"&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/1629/is-female-genital-mutilation-an-islamic-problem "Is Female Genital Mutilation an Islamic Problem?"], ''Middle East Quarterly'', accessed 5 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 article by journalist Susan Mubarak describes FGM practice in Oman, and claims the practice is very common in [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar]] in the southwest. The author went on to say that a previous article on the topic received both positive feedback for spreading awareness of what some considered a 'horrific tradition', as well as negative feedback from others for 'hanging Dhofar’s dirty washing for the world to see and criticising a practice that they believe is purely Islamic,' commenting that she 'paid little attention to these criticisms because I know the practice is harmful and primitive', and 'our religion neither encourages the practice nor condemns it.'&lt;ref name="muscatdaily.com"/&gt; 

According to a small survey by human rights activist and statistician Habiba Al Hinai conducted in October 2013 and published in January 2014, 78% of 100 women interviewed living in the capital city of [[Muscat]] had undergone FGM. These women came from all parts of the country, each region showing a very high prevalence, and even though fewer women from Muscat itself had undergone FGM, they were still in the majority. Her findings contradicted the common belief that FGM was only widespread in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wluml.org/news/new-study-oman-shows-high-prevalence-fgm-all-over-country |title=New study in Oman shows high prevalence of FGM all over the country &amp;#124; Women Reclaiming and Redefining Cultures |publisher=Wluml.org |date=22 January 2014 |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Type I is mostly performed in southern Oman and typically performed within a few weeks of a girl's birth, while Type IV is observed in other parts of northern Oman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theweek.co.om/printCon.aspx?Cval=6181 FOCUS ON FGM] Victoria Cuthbert, The Week (Oman), (April 25, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The only indigenous tribe in Latin America known to practise FGM is Colombia's [[Emberá people]]. The tradition was extremely secretive and taboo until a 2007 incident, in which a girl died as a result of FGM. The incident caused much controversy, raised awareness and stimulated debate about ending the practice altogether. In 2015, it was reported that of the approximately 250,000 members of the tribe, 25,000 (10%) had decided to discontinue female genital mutilation, with a community leader saying they hoped to eradicate it by 2030.&lt;ref name=Moloney&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moloney|first1=Anastasia|title=Colombia's Embera tribe hopes to eradicate FGM by 2030|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/us-colombia-girls-fgm-idUSKBN0LA2FX20150206|website=Reuters|accessdate=6 August 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714145347/https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/us-colombia-girls-fgm-idUSKBN0LA2FX20150206|archivedate=14 July 2015|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a criminal offence to take, or propose to take, a child outside Australia to have a FGM procedure performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Female Genital Mutilation: Information for Australian Health Professionals|author=Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|publisher=Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of FGM in Australia is unknown as it is often only uncovered when women and girls are taken to hospital due to complications with the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20701170-2,00.html "Girls mutilated for 'tradition'"], ''The Sunday Telegraph'', 5 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 two unnamed women became the first people in Australia to be convicted of carrying out FGM; their case was also the first time such an offense had come to trial in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-34795203 |title=Australia convicts two over female genital mutilation - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the first national study by researches at the [[Westmead Children's Hospital]] in Sydney found 59 girls having attended medical staff since 2010, with many having had the most extreme form of the procedure done to them. A fifth of those had [[infibulation]], the removal of the clitoris and external genitalia with the opening sewed up. The number was deemed to strongly underestimate the true number of cases. Most of the procedures had been done overseas, but two children born in Australia had the procedure done in [[New South Wales]] and a third child born in Australia had been taken to Indonesia to have the procedure done. Of the 59 girls, only 13 had been in contact with child protection services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-13/report-on-female-genital-mutilation-shows-hidden-prevalence/8180340|title=Months-old babies subjected to female genital mutilation, report finds|date=2017-01-13|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most (about 90%) were identified during refugee screening and had African origin.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zurynski|first=Yvonne|last2=Phu|first2=Amy|last3=Sureshkumar|first3=Premala|last4=Cherian|first4=Sarah|last5=Deverell|first5=Marie|last6=Elliott|first6=Elizabeth J.|date=2017-06-01|title=Female genital mutilation in children presenting to Australian paediatricians|url=https://adc.bmj.com/content/102/6/509|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|language=en|volume=102|issue=6|pages=509–515|doi=10.1136/archdischild-2016-311540|issn=0003-9888|pmid=28082321}}&lt;/ref&gt;The report also stated that there was no FGM registry in Australia and even when detected is not routinely reported. The two most common countries of birth for the girls were Somalia (24) and Eritrea (12).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===New Zealand===
Under a 1995 amendment to the Crimes Act, it is illegal to perform "any medical or surgical procedure or mutilation of the vagina or clitoris of any person" for reasons of "culture, religion, custom or practice". It is also illegal to send or make any arrangement for a child to be sent out of New Zealand for FGM to be performed, assist or encourage any person in New Zealand to perform FGM on a New Zealand citizen or resident outside New Zealand convince or encourage any other New Zealand citizen or resident to go outside New Zealand to have FGM performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fgm.co.nz/ "Female Genital Mutilation: Information for health and child protection professionals], New Zealand Ministry of Health, accessed 7 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian activist Masooma Ranalvi, who underwent FGM as a 7-year-old, was quoted as saying: "[T]he entire discourse on FGM up to now has centred on Africa. Africa of course needs attention but maybe there are other places where the focus can be spread to."&lt;ref name="Batha"/&gt;

In certain communities of Indonesia, mass female circumcision (''khitanan massal'') ceremony are organized by local Islamic foundations around Prophet Muhammad’s birthday. Some FGM are Type IV done with a pen knife, others are Type I done with scissors. Two Indonesian nationwide studies in 2003 and 2010 found over 80% of the cases sampled involved cutting, typically of newborns through the age of 9. The surveys demonstrated that circumcision among girls and boys is a universal practice in the study sites, in all of which Islam was the primary religion. Across the sites, among all the children aged 15–18, 86-100% of the girls were reported already circumcised. More than 90% of families visited in the studies claimed they wanted the practice to continue.&lt;ref name=ahin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACU138.pdf Female Circumcision in Indonesia] Population Council and USAID, September 2003; see pages 24-27 and full report&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records suggest female circumcision in Indonesia started and became prevalent with the arrival of Islam in the 13th century as part of its drive to convert people to Islam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12691">'''Privacy-Enhancing Technologies''' (PET) are the methods of [[Data Protection|protecting data]] in accordance with the law. PET allow [[User (computing)|online users]] to protect the [[data privacy|privacy]] of their [[personally identifiable information]] (PII) provided to and handled by services or applications. PET uses techniques to minimize possession of personal data without losing the functionality of an information system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|van Blarkom|Borking|Olk|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals of PETs==
The objective of PETs is to protect personal data and ensure the users of technology that their information is confidential and management of data protection is a priority to the organizations who withhold responsibility for any [[Personally identifiable information|PII]] - allowing users to take one or more of the following actions related to their personal data sent to and used by, online service providers, merchants or other users.

The goal of privacy-enhancing technologies include increasing control over personal data sent to, and used by, online service providers and merchants (or other online users)([[Informational self-determination|self-determination]]). PETs aim to minimize personal data collected and used by service providers and merchants, use [[Pseudonym|pseudonyms]] or anonymous data credentials to provide anonymity, and strive to achieve informed consent about giving personal data to online service providers and merchants.&lt;ref&gt;The EU PRIME research project's [https://www.prime-project.eu/about/vision/ Vision on privacy enhanced identity management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011000720/https://www.prime-project.eu/about/vision |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Privacy Negotiations, consumers and service providers establish, maintain, and refine privacy policies as individualized agreements through the ongoing choice among service alternatives, therefore providing the possibility to negotiate the terms and conditions of giving personal data to online service providers and merchants (data handling/privacy policy negotiation). Within private negotiations, the transaction partners may additionally bundle the personal information collection and processing schemes with monetary or non-monetary rewards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://privacy-negotiations.de Key Facts on Privacy Negotiations]&lt;/ref&gt;

PETs provide the possibility to remotely audit the enforcement of these terms and conditions at the online service providers and merchants (assurance), allow users to log, archive and look up past transfers of their personal data, including what data has been transferred, when, to whom and under what conditions, and facilitate the use of their legal rights of data inspection, correction and deletion.

==Existing PETs==
Examples of existing privacy enhancing technologies are:
* '''[[Anonymizer|Communication anonymizers]]''' hiding the real online identity (email address, IP address, etc.) and replacing it with a non-traceable identity (disposable / one-time email address, random IP address of hosts participating in an anonymising network, pseudonym, etc.). They can be applied to email, Web browsing, [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] networking, [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], Chat, instant messaging, etc.
* '''Shared bogus online accounts'''. One person creates an account for MSN, providing bogus data for Name, address, phone number, preferences, life situation etc. They then publish their user-IDs and passwords on the Internet. Everybody can now use this account comfortably. Thereby the user is sure that there is no personal data about him or her in the account profile. (Moreover, he is freed from the hassle of having to register at the site himself.)
*  '''Obfuscation''' refers to the many practices of adding distracting or misleading data to a log or profile, which may be especially useful for frustrating precision analytics after data has already been lost or disclosed. Its effectiveness against humans is questioned, but it has greater promise against shallow algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/obfuscation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8328401/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Access to personal data''': The service provider's infrastructure allows users to inspect, correct or delete all their data stored at the service provider.
*'''[[Enhanced privacy ID]] (EPID)''' is a [[Digital Signature Algorithm|digital signature algorithm]] supporting anonymity. Unlike traditional digital signature algorithms (e.g., [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]]), in which each entity has a unique public verification key and a unique private signature key, EPID provides a common group public verification key associated with many of unique private signature keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/PEC2011/presentations2011/brickell.pdf|title=Enhanced Privacy Id|last=|first=|date=December 2011|website=|publisher=|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPID was created so that a device could prove to an external party what kind of device it is (and optionally what software is running on the device) without needing to also reveal exact identity, i.e., to prove you are an authentic member of a group without revealing ''which'' member. It has been in use since 2008.

==Future PETs==
Examples of privacy enhancing technologies that are being researched or developed include&lt;ref&gt;The EU PRIME research project's [https://www.prime-project.eu/prime_products/whitepaper/PRIME-Whitepaper-V2.pdf White Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817132944/https://www.prime-project.eu/prime_products/whitepaper/PRIME-Whitepaper-V2.pdf |date=2007-08-17 }} (Version 2)&lt;/ref&gt; limited disclosure technology, anonymous credentials such as online car rental, negotiation and enforcement of data handling conditions, and data transaction log. '''Limited disclosure technology''' provides a way of protecting individuals' privacy by allowing them to share only enough personal information with service providers to complete an interaction or transaction. This technology is also designed to limit tracking and correlation of users’ interactions with these third parties. Limited disclosure uses [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] techniques and allows users to retrieve data that is vetted by a provider, to transmit that data to a relying party, and have these relying parties trust the authenticity and integrity of the data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/limited-disclosure-technology Gartner IT Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Anonymous credentials''' are asserted properties or rights of the [[credential]] holder that don't reveal the true identity of the holder; the only information revealed is what the holder of the credential is willing to disclose. The assertion can be issued by the user himself/herself, by the provider of the online service or by a third party (another service provider, a government agency, etc.). For example:

'''Online car rental'''. The car rental agency doesn't need to know the true identity of the customer. It only needs to make sure that the customer is over 23 (as an example), that the customer has a drivers license, [[health insurance]] (i.e. for accidents, etc.), and that the customer is paying. Thus there is no real need to know the customers name nor their address or any other [[personal information]]. Anonymous credentials allow both parties to be comfortable: they allow the customer to only reveal so much data which the car rental agency needs for providing its service (data minimization), and they allow the car rental agency to verify their requirements and get their money. When ordering a car online, the user, instead of providing the classical name, address and [[credit card number]], provides the following credentials, all issued to [[pseudonym]]s (i.e. not to the real name of the customer):
* An assertion of minimal age, issued by the state, proving that the holder is older than 23 (note: the actual age is not provided)
* A [[driving licence]], i.e. an assertion, issued by the motor vehicle control agency, that the holder is entitled to drive cars
* A [[proof of insurance]], issued by the health insurance
* Digital cash
'''Negotiation and enforcement of data handling conditions'''. Before ordering a product or service online, the user and the online service provider or merchant negotiate the type of personal data that is to be transferred to the service provider. This includes the conditions that shall apply to the handling of the personal data, such as whether or not it may be sent to third parties (profile selling) and under what conditions (e.g. only while informing the user), or at what time in the future it shall be deleted (if at all). After the transfer of personal data took place, the agreed upon data handling conditions are technically enforced by the infrastructure of the service provider, which is capable of managing and processing and data handling obligations. Moreover, this enforcement can be remotely audited by the user, for example by verifying chains of certification based on [[Trusted computing]] modules or by verifying privacy seals/labels that were issued by third party auditing organisations (e.g. data protection agencies). Thus instead of the user having to rely on the mere promises of service providers not to abuse [[personal data]], users will be more confident about the service provider adhering to the negotiated data handling conditions &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spdp.di.unimi.it/papers/samarati-ifip06.pdf|title=Enhancing User Privacy Through Data Handling Policies|last=|first=|date=2006|website=|publisher=|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the '''data transaction log''' allows users the ability to log the personal data they send to service provider(s), the time in which they do it, and under what conditions. These logs are stored and allow users to determine what data they have sent to whom, or they can establish the type of data that is in possession by a specific service provider. This leads to more [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], which is a pre-requisite of being in control.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9872">'''Religious stratification'''  is the division of a society into hierarchical layers on the basis of [[religious belief]]s, affiliation, or [[faith]] practices.  

According to [[Kingsley Davis]] and [[Wilbert E. Moore]], "[t]he reason why religion is necessary is apparently to be found in the fact that human society achieves its unity primarily through the possession by its members of certain ultimate values and ends in common".&lt;ref&gt;*Davis, Kingsley and Wilbert E Moore, 1945.  "Some Principles of Stratification," ''American Sociological Review 10''(April): 242-49.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Davis and Moore contend that it is "the role of religious belief and ritual to supply and reinforce this appearance of reality" that these "certain ultimate values" have. This is one possible explanation for why [[religion]] is one of the underlying factors which links various forms of [[Social inequality|inequality]] into a chain of [[Social stratification|stratification]].

==Critical overview==
Broadly defined, [[social stratification]] is constituted by the division of a society into hierarchical layers of wealth, power, and prestige. These layers, or strata, have been related to a variety of social categories, such as:

*[[Race (classification of humans)|Race]]
*[[Social class|Class]]
*[[Gender]]
*[[Ethnicity]]
*[[Religion]]

[[Sociologist]]s have paid attention to stratification based on race, class, gender, and ethnicity.  Religion is closely tied to ethnic affiliation. Research suggests that religious stratification deserves more attention than it usually gets. It is a common development in religiously diverse societies. Once it becomes embedded in societies' laws, customs, and ideologies, it tends to persist. It also has societal consequences. Thus, it is important in its own right, but also in relation to other forms of stratification.

==In the United States==

Sociologists James D. Davidson and Ralph E. Pyle (2011) argue that religious stratification emerged during America's colonial period, as a result of religious [[ethnocentrism]], religious competition, and unequal resources. They show that Anglicans, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians were over-represented among the economic, political, and educational elites. Other Protestant groups, Catholics, Jews, and people with no religious preference ranked much lower in status. 

The ranking of religious groups has changed in some ways over the course of U.S. history (Davidson and Pyle 2011, Pyle 1996). Most notably, Jews have risen into the upper stratum, while Catholics have climbed into the upper-middle stratum. However, religious stratification persists. For example, Anglicans (now Episcopalians), Congregationalists (now United Church of Christ), and Presbyterians remain in the upper stratum, and other Protestants groups such as Baptists (who ranked low in the colonial period) still have not experienced much upward mobility. 

These developments are linked to inter-religious power struggles related to membership size, organizational capacity, and resources. The struggles affect societal laws, ideologies, and customs. In the colonial period, religious stratification was justified by law: Congregationalists were the "established" church in New England colonies; Anglicans were the "established" church in southern colonies. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments, along with other civil rights laws, have knocked the legal foundation out from under religious stratification. The pro-Protestant ideology that emerged in the colonial period has been tempered somewhat by [[multiculturalism]], but it remains an integral part of American culture. Religious groups that have adapted most to this ideology have experienced more mobility than other groups. Colonial elites also have developed a number of customs, such as church-sponsored preparatory schools, private colleges, universities, and [[legacy preferences|legacy admission]]s that have perpetuated their prominence (Coe and Davidson 2011). Another custom has been the tendency to appoint other religious elites to political office (Davidson, Kraus, and Morrissey 2005). Jews and Catholics have developed customs of their own, such as parochial schools and business ownership, that have contributed to improvements in their social status.

Contrary to Davis and Moore's argument that stratification is functional for society, Davidson and Pyle (2011) argue that religious stratification destabilizes society. It produces social problems, like religious hate crimes, that would not otherwise exist.

==Stratification as the result of the social implications of religion==

According to Evelyn L. Lehrer religion has a significant impact on marital stability, the choice of marital partner, fertility, women's work at home and in the labor market, education, wages and wealth, and the timing of entry into first union and the choice of whether to cohabit.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn L. Lehrer ''Religion as a Determinant of Economic and Demographic Behavior''&lt;/ref&gt;  In her research there are many instances in which stratification is the byproduct of religious faith practices.  Stratification based on religion is evident specifically in the realm of economics.
  
One case in point is the presence of women in the work force. Lehrer explains "The Mormon and conservative Protestant faiths make a sharp distinction between male and female social and economic roles, encouraging the traditional division of labor within the household when young children are present" (713).  Depending on the socioeconomic class of the family, the expectation of the woman to adhere to these traditional social roles could be a factor by which the economic advancement of the family is limited. 
 
Cited within Lehrer's book are studies which examine levels of education, wages, and wealth among different religious faiths.  Lehrer writes in her book, "A conservative Protestant upbringing may be associated with an authoritarian approach to knowledge and a rejection of critical inquiry and unconventional modes of thinking, implying lower levels of certain types of home investments in child quality" (716).  This was derived from the work of Sherkat and Darnell published in 1999.  Also based on the work of Sherkat and Darnell published in 1997, is Lehrer's assertion that conservative Protestant parents "often discourage their children from taking college preparatory courses, out of a concern that such courses may be harmful to them" (716).  Lehrer, as a result, contends that children raised by conservative Protestant parents "often acquire less human capital in their formative years and may thus be less able to benefit from college" (716).   So, as the topic is quite well developed, educational inequality is well researched and there is much evidence concerning the impact that an individual's level of education can have in terms of the hierarchy of stratification.  It seems however that there can be seen another factor which should be allowed for in terms of determining the lines of stratification.  Perhaps the significant impact that education plays in inequality can be even better understood when religion is controlled for.  

Other works which have investigated religious stratification include that of Gaetano Mosca whose research was published in his The Ruling Class.  Although this work was published in the late 1930s the concept that is brought forth is interesting to note and is perhaps still quite relevant in contemporary times.  Mosca states that "In societies in which religious beliefs are strong and ministers of the faith form a special class a priestly aristocracy almost always arises and gains possession of a more or less important share of the wealth and the political power."

A typical application is when clients need to agree on which sites (or proxies) objects are assigned to. When ''k'' is 1, it subsumes the goals of [[consistent hashing]], using an entirely different method.

== History ==

Rendezvous hashing was invented in 1996 by David Thaler and Chinya Ravishankar at the [[University of Michigan]]. [[Consistent hashing]] appears to have been devised around the same time at MIT. One of the first applications of rendezvous hashing was to enable multicast clients on the Internet (in contexts such as the [[MBONE]]) to identify multicast rendezvous points in a distributed fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blazevic|first=Ljubica|title=Distributed Core Multicast (DCM): a routing protocol for many  small groups  with application to  mobile IP telephony|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-blazevic-dcm-mobility-01|work=IETF Draft|publisher=IETF|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fenner|first=B.|title=Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM):                     Protocol Specification (Revised)|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4601|work=IETF RFC|publisher=IETF|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in 1998 by Microsoft's [[Cache Array Routing Protocol]] (CARP) for distributed cache coordination and routing.&lt;ref name="carp"&gt;{{cite web|last=Valloppillil|first=Vinod|author2=Kenneth Ross |title=Cache Array Routing Protocol v1.0|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vinod-carp-v1-03|publisher=Internet Draft|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cache Array Routing Protocol and Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0|url=http://oldsite.mcoecn.org/WhitePapers/Mscarp.pdf|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=September 15, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918115447/http://oldsite.mcoecn.org/WhitePapers/Mscarp.pdf|archivedate=September 18, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Protocol Independent Multicast]] routing protocols use rendezvous hashing to pick a rendezvous point.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The HRW algorithm for rendezvous hashing ==

Rendezvous hashing solves the [[distributed hash table]] problem: How can a set of clients, given an object ''O'', agree on where in a set of ''n'' sites (servers, say) to place ''O''? Each client is to select a site independently, but all clients must end up picking the same site. This is non-trivial if we add a ''minimal disruption'' constraint, and require that only objects mapping to a removed site may be reassigned to other sites.

The basic idea is to give each site ''S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' a score (a ''weight'') for each object ''O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and assign the object to the highest scoring site. All clients first agree on a hash function ''h()''. For object ''O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', the site ''S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined to have weight ''w&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt; = h(O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)''. HRW assigns ''O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the site ''S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' whose weight ''w&lt;sub&gt;i,m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the largest. Since ''h()'' is agreed upon, each client can independently compute the weights ''w&lt;sub&gt;i,1&lt;/sub&gt;, w&lt;sub&gt;i,2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., w&lt;sub&gt;i,n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and pick the largest. If the goal is distributed ''k''-agreement, the clients can independently pick the sites with the ''k'' largest hash values.

If a site ''S'' is added or removed, only the objects mapping to ''S'' are remapped to different sites, satisfying the minimal disruption constraint above. The HRW assignment can be computed independently by any client, since it depends only on the identifiers for the set of sites ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the object being assigned.

HRW easily accommodates different capacities among sites. If site ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' has twice the capacity of the other sites, we simply represent ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' twice in the list, say, as ''S&lt;sub&gt;k,1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''S&lt;sub&gt;k,2&lt;/sub&gt;''. Clearly, twice as many objects will now map to ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' as to the other sites.

== Properties ==

It might first appear sufficient to treat the ''n'' sites as buckets in a [[hash table]] and hash the object name ''O'' into this table. However, if any of the sites fails or is unreachable, the hash table size changes, requiring all objects to be remapped. This massive disruption makes such direct hashing unworkable. Under rendezvous hashing, however, clients handle site failures by picking the site that yields the next largest weight. Remapping is required only for objects currently mapped to the failed site, and as proved in,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; disruption is minimal. Rendezvous hashing has the following properties.
# '''Low overhead:''' The hash function used is efficient, so overhead at the clients is very low.
# '''[[Load balancing (computing)|Load balancing]]:''' Since the hash function is randomizing, each of the ''n ''sites is equally likely to receive the object ''O''. Loads are uniform across the sites.
## '''Site capacity:''' Sites with different capacities can be represented in the site list with multiplicity in proportion to capacity. A site with twice the capacity of the other sites will be represented twice in the list, while every other site is represented once.
# '''High [[hit rate]]:''' Since all clients agree on placing an object ''O'' into the same site ''S&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;'' , each fetch or placement of ''O'' into ''S&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;'' yields the maximum utility in terms of hit rate. The object ''O'' will always be found unless it is evicted by some replacement algorithm at ''S&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;'' .
# '''Minimal disruption:''' When a site fails, only the objects mapped to that site need to be remapped. Disruption is at the minimal possible level, as proved in &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.
# '''Distributed ''k''-agreement:''' Clients can reach distributed agreement on ''k'' sites simply by selecting the top ''k'' sites in the ordering, as in &lt;ref name="foisting" /&gt;.

=== Comparison with consistent hashing ===

Consistent hashing operates by mapping sites uniformly and randomly to points on a unit circle called tokens. Objects are also mapped to the unit circle and placed in the site whose token is the first encountered traveling clockwise from the object's location. When a site is removed, the objects it owns are transferred to the site owning the next token encountered moving clockwise. Provided each site is mapped to a large number (100-200, say) of tokens this will reassign objects in a relatively uniform fashion among the remaining sites.

If sites are mapped to points on the circle randomly by hashing 200 variants of the site ID, say, the assignment of any object requires storing or recalculating 200 hash values for each site. However, the tokens associated with a given site can be precomputed and stored in a sorted list, requiring only a single application of the hash function to the object, and a binary search to compute the assignment. Even with many tokens per site, however, the basic version of consistent hashing may not balance objects uniformly over sites, since when a site is removed each object assigned to it is distributed only over as many other sites as the site has tokens (say 100-200). Variants of consistent hashing (such as Amazon's Dynamo&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) that use more complex logic to distribute tokens on the unit circle offer better load balancing than basic consistent hashing, reduce the overhead of adding new sites, and reduce metadata overhead and offer other benefits. Such methods, however, are even more complex than basic consistent hashing.

In contrast, rendezvous hashing (HRW) is much simpler both conceptually and in practice. It also distributes objects uniformly over all sites, given a uniform hash function. Unlike consistent hashing, HRW requires no precomputing or storage of tokens. An object ''O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is placed into one of ''n'' sites ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' by computing the ''n'' hash values ''h(O&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)'' and picking the site ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' that yields the highest hash value. If a new site ''S&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is added, new object placements or requests will compute ''n+1'' hash values, and pick the largest of these. If an object already in the system at ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' maps to this new site ''S&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'', it will be fetched afresh and cached at ''S&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;''. All clients will henceforth obtain it from this site, and the old cached copy at ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' will ultimately be replaced by the local cache management algorithm. If ''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is taken offline, its objects will be remapped uniformly to the remaining ''n-1'' sites.

Variants of the HRW algorithm, such as the use of a skeleton (see below), can reduce the ''O(n)'' time for object location to ''O(log(n))'', at the cost of less global uniformity of placement. When ''n'' is not too large, however, the ''O(n)'' placement cost of basic HRW is not likely to be a problem. HRW completely avoids all the overhead and complexity associated with correctly handling multiple tokens for each site and associated metadata.

Rendezvous hashing also has the great advantage that it provides simple solutions to other important problems, such as distributed ''k''-agreement.

=== Reducing consistent hashing to rendezvous hashing ===
Consistent hashing can be reduced to an instance of HRW by an appropriate choice of a two-place hash function. From the site identifier &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; the simplest version of consistent hashing computes a list of token positions, e.g., &lt;math&gt;t_i = h_c(S\hat{}i)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h_c&lt;/math&gt; hashes values to locations on the unit circle. Define the two place hash function &lt;math&gt;h(S,O)&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\min_i h_c(O) - t_i}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h_c(O) - t_i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the distance along the unit circle from &lt;math&gt;h_c(O)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;h_c(O) - t_i&lt;/math&gt; has some minimal non-zero value there is no problem translating this value to a unique integer in some bounded range). This will duplicate exactly the assignment produced by consistent hashing.

It is not possible, however, to reduce HRW to consistent hashing (assuming the number of tokens per site is bounded), since HRW potentially reassigns the objects from a removed site to an unbounded number of other sites.

== Implementation ==

Implementation is straightforward once a hash function ''h()'' is chosen (the original work on the HRW method&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; makes a hash function recommendation). Each client only needs to compute a hash value for each of the ''n'' sites, and then pick the largest. This algorithm runs in ''O(n)'' time. If the hash function is efficient, the ''O(n)'' running time is not a problem, unless ''n'' is very large.

== Extending rendezvous hashing with weight factors ==

In the standard implementation of rendezvous hashing, every node receives a statically equal proportion of the keys. This behavior, however, is undesirable when the nodes have different capacities for processing or holding their assigned keys. For example, if one of the nodes had twice the storage capacity as the others, it would be beneficial if the algorithm could take this into account such that this more powerful node would receive twice the number of keys as each of the others.

A straightforward mechanism to handle this case is to assign two virtual locations to this node, so that if either of that larger node's virtual locations has the highest hash, that node receives the key. But this strategy does not work when the relative weights are not integer multiples. For example, if one node had 42% more storage capacity, it would require adding many virtual nodes in different proportions, leading to greatly reduced performance. Several modifications to rendezvous hashing have been proposed to overcome this limitation.

=== Cache Array Routing Protocol ===

The [[Cache Array Routing Protocol]] (CARP) is a 1998 IETF draft&lt;ref name="carp"/&gt; that describes a method for computing ''load factors'' which can be multiplied by each node's hash score to yield an arbitrary level of precision for weighting nodes differently. However, one disadvantage of this approach is that when any node's weight is changed, or when any node is added or removed, all the load factors must be re-computed and relatively scaled. When the load factors change relative to one another, it triggers movement of keys between nodes whose weight was not changed, but whose load factor did change relative to other nodes in the system. This results in excess movement of keys.&lt;ref name="wrh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SDC15_presentations/dist_sys/Jason_Resch_New_Consistent_Hashings_Rev.pdf | title=New Hashing Algorithms for Data Storage |author=Jason Resch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controlled replication under scalable hashing ===

Controlled replication under scalable hashing or CRUSH&lt;ref name="crush"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crss.ucsc.edu/media/papers/weil-sc06.pdf | title=CRUSH: Controlled, Scalable, Decentralized Placement of Replicated Data |author=Sage A. Weil et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension to RUSH&lt;ref name="rush"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/media/papers/honicky-ipdps04.pdf | title=Replication Under Scalable Hashing: A Family of Algorithms for Scalable Decentralized Data Distribution |author=R. J. Honicky, Ethan L. Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; that improves upon rendezvous hashing by constructing a tree where a pseudo-random function (hash) is used to navigate down the tree to find which node is ultimately responsible for a given key. It permits perfect stability for adding nodes however it is not perfectly stable when removing or re-weighting nodes, with the excess movement of keys being proportional to the height of the tree.

The CRUSH algorithm is used by the [[Ceph (software)|ceph]] data storage system to map data objects to the nodes responsible for storing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/operations/crush-map/ | title=Crush Maps |author=Ceph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weighted distributed hash tables and weighted rendezvous hash ===

In 2005, Christian Schindelhauer and Gunnar Schomaker described a ''logarithmic method''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Weighted Distributed Hash Tables |pages = 218|author=Christian Schindelhauer, Gunnar Schomaker|citeseerx = 10.1.1.414.9353|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; for re-weighting hash scores in a way that does not require relative scaling of load factors when a node's weight changes or when nodes are added or removed. This enables the dual benefits of perfect precision when weighting nodes, along with perfect stability—only a minimum number of keys must be remapped to new nodes upon any weight change.

A similar logarithmic based hashing strategy is used to assign data to storage nodes in [[Cleversafe]]'s data storage system,&lt;ref name="wrh"/&gt; now [[IBM Cloud Object Storage]].

=== Skeleton-based variant for very large ''n'' ===
[[File:Hrw skeleton.pdf|thumb|Skeleton used in HRW implementation.]]

When ''n'' is extremely large, the following variant can improve running time.&lt;ref name="CSE Technical Report UCR-CS 2001-05062"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yao|first1=Zizhen|last2=Ravishankar|first2=Chinya|last3=Tripathi|first3=Satish|title=Hash-Based Virtual Hierarchies for Caching in Hybrid Content-Delivery Networks|date=May 13, 2001|publisher=CSE Department, University of California, Riverside|location=Riverside, CA|url=http://static.cs.ucr.edu/store/techreports/UCR-CS-2001-05062.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Wei|author2=Chinya Ravishankar |title=Hash-Based Virtual Hierarchies for Scalable Location Service in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks|journal=Mobile Networks and Applications|date=January 2009|volume=14|issue=5|pages=625–637|doi=10.1007/s11036-008-0144-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| first = Anup| last = Mayank| first2 = Trivikram | last2 = Phatak| first3 = Chinya| last3 = Ravishankar| title = Decentralized Hash-Based Coordination of Distributed Multimedia Caches | series = Proc. 5th IEEE International Conference on Networking (ICN'06) | year = 2006| place = Mauritius| publisher = IEEE| url = http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~ravi/Papers/NWConf/ICN2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach creates a virtual hierarchical structure (called a ''skeleton''), and achieves ''O(log n)'' running time by applying HRW at each level while descending the hierarchy. The idea is to first choose some constant ''m'' and organize the ''n'' sites into ''c ='' ceiling''(n/m)'' clusters ''C&lt;sub&gt;1,&lt;/sub&gt; = {S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ,S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {S&lt;sub&gt;m+1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;m+2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ,S&lt;sub&gt;2m&lt;/sub&gt;}, ...'' Next, build a virtual hierarchy by choosing a constant ''f'' and imagining these ''c'' clusters placed at the leaves of a tree ''T'' of virtual nodes, each with fanout ''f''.

In the accompanying diagram, the cluster size is ''m = 4'', and the skeleton fanout is ''f = 3''. Assuming 108 sites (real nodes) for convenience, we get a three-tier virtual hierarchy. Since ''f = 3'', each virtual node has a natural numbering in octal. Thus, the 27 virtual nodes at the lowest tier would be numbered 000, 001, 002, ..., 221, 222, in octal. (We can, of course, vary the fanout at each level. In that case, each node will be identified with the corresponding mixed-radix number.)

Instead of applying HRW to all 108 real nodes, we can first apply HRW to the 27 lowest-tier virtual nodes, selecting one. We then apply HRW to the four real nodes in its cluster, and choose the winning site. We only need 27 + 4 = 31 hashes, rather than 108. If we apply this method starting one level higher in the hierarchy, we would need 9 + 3 + 4 = 16 hashes to get to the winning site. The figure shows how, if we proceed starting from the root of the skeleton, we may successively choose the virtual nodes (2)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, (20)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and (200)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and finally end up with site 74.

We can start at any level in the virtual hierarchy, not just at the root. Starting lower in the hierarchy requires more hashes, but may improve load distribution in the case of failures. Also, the virtual hierarchy need not be stored, but can be created on demand, since the virtual nodes names are simply prefixes of base-''f'' (or mixed-radix) representations. We can easily create appropriately sorted strings from the digits, as required. In the example, we would be working with the strings 0, 1, 2 (at tier 1), 20, 21, 22 (at tier 2), and 200, 201, 202 (at tier 3). Clearly, ''T'' has height ''h = O (log c) = O (log n)'', since ''m'' and ''f'' are both constants. The work done at each level is ''O (1)'', since ''f'' is a constant.

For any given object ''O'', it is clear that the method chooses each cluster, and hence each of the ''n'' sites, with equal probability. If the site finally selected is unavailable, we can select a different site within the same cluster, in the usual manner. Alternatively, we could go up one or more tiers in the skeleton and select an alternate from among the sibling virtual nodes at that tier, and once again descend the hierarchy to the real nodes, as above.

The value of ''m'' can be chosen based upon such factors as the anticipated failure rate and the degree of load balancing desired. A higher value of ''m'' leads to less load skew in the event of failure, at the cost of somewhat higher search overhead.

The choice ''m = n'' is equivalent to non-hierarchical rendezvous hashing. In practice, the hash ''h()'' is very cheap, so ''m = n'' can work quite well unless ''n'' is very high.

'''Return on modeling effort''' ('''ROME''') is the benefit resulting from a (supplementary) effort to improve a model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://erikproper.blogspot.fr/2009/02/models-that-matter-return-on-modelling.html|title=Models that matter; Return on Modelling Effort|website=erikproper.blogspot.fr|last=Proper|first=Erik|year=2009|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
In engineering, [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] always serves a particular goal. For example, the lightning protection of aircraft can be modeled as an electrical circuit, in order to predict whether the protection will still work in 30 years, given the ageing of its electrical components. More and more effort can be put in making this model predict reality perfectly. However, this perfection comes at a price: researchers invest time and money in improving the model. As a [[Return on investment]] (ROI), the ROME is a metric for the use of further modeling. It may therefore serve as a 'stopping criterion'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Typically, researchers will pull towards continuing modeling, while management will pull towards stopping modeling. Being explicit about the cost and benefits of continued modeling may help to make informed decisions that are understood by both sides.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Domains ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18621">'''Scandinavian law''', alternatively known as Nordic Law&lt;ref&gt;Wahlgren, P. (2007). What is Scandinavian law? Social private law. Stockholm: Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law, Law Faculty, Stockholm University.&lt;/ref&gt; is the law of the five [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] countries, namely [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. It is generally regarded as a subgroup of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] or as an individual legal body in itself. Prior to the 19th century, the [[Europe]]an countries were independent in their administering and legality. However, in 1872, the Nordic countries organised legislative cooperation. Especially in areas of contracts and commerce, as well as those concerned with family, nationality and extradition, the five states have obtained uniform legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, H. (2017).

==Historial development==

Prior to the establishment of [[Scandinavia]]n states in the 9th century, the numerous regions were independent in their administration and legal matters. Initially, the legal system had no written laws; rather, it consisted of customary law that was developed and reformed by the citizens themselves at meetings known as “things”. Customary laws were recorded in writing between the 11th and 13th centuries. These include, the Gulathing’s law (11th century, Norwegian); the law of Jutland (1241, Danish); and the laws of Uppland (1296, Swedish) and Götaland (13th century, Swedish).&lt;ref&gt;Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

The early laws were not formatted as they are in modern-day legal systems, rather they used codes. These included private law, namely criminal law, family law, succession, property law, contract law, constitutional and administrative law. Laws relating to the Church were usually treated separate to laws of the states and people. The codes represented customary laws and usually, foreign influences were neglected. Mutual with Germanic laws, the provincial laws abided by externalities and thus, were more advanced. King Magnus’ Swedish code (1350) abolished the concepts of vengeance, stating that the king’s officials should be the necessary authorities in administering criminal proceedings and hold punishment for those who went against the law. Further, presumably by influence of the Christian religion, the legal system was introduced for the benefit of peasants and the helpless class.&lt;ref&gt;Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in 1380 Norway and Denmark were ruled by a common king – [[Olav IV]], the two states maintained laws separate to one another. Before the acquisition by Frederick III in 1660, supplementary laws were introduced. During the rule of Christain V, a thorough process of codification took place, with the earlier laws being replaced by Christain V’s Danish Law (1683) and Norwegian Law (1687). These new laws were predominantly based on the existing laws of the two counties with influences of Germanic and Roman laws being fairly minor. Similar to the earlier laws, these new laws consisted of both public and private law. At the time of their drafting, these codes read well and reflected individual human rights and the ideologies of equality. Further, in comparison to the laws of other European countries, the criminal law provisions were fair, humane and reflected individual rights. &lt;ref&gt;Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, the laws issued by King Christopher in 1442 were affirmed by Charles IX in 1608. However, following the Danish-Norwegian reforms, a royal commission was assembled to draft a modern new code. The result being, “the Law of 1734”, declared by Frederick I. Held by Sweden in the 13th century, Finland followed the Swedish law of 1734, which was translated in Finnish as “Law of the Realm of Finland”.&lt;ref&gt;Hiorthoy, F. (2016). Scandinavian law. [online] Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-law [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Scandinavian law==

In most of the five Nordic States, the old codes have developed by parliamentary statutes. However, in Sweden, the law of 1734 is still regarded as a formal framework. In the other countries, codes are no longer of importance, rather, comprehensive codification of public and private law holds importance. 

While the historic codes still hold significance in Scandinavia today, the developments in modern Scandinavia has led to growth in Scandinavian civil law by way of statutes. Although the five Nordic countries follow similar legal theories, they have developed their own legal standards. Nonetheless, the countries follow an agreement to cooperate on legislative matters.&lt;ref&gt;Cagan, D. and Simonyi, A. (n.d.). Nordic Ways.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 1872 when the agreement was entered into, the organised legislative cooperation in Scandinavian law has progressively increased in significance. As such, the Nordic states have achieved uniform legislation, in fields of contracts, commerce, family, nation and extradition.&lt;ref&gt;Husa, J., Nuotio, K. and Pihlajamäki, H. (2007). Nordic law. Antwerp: Intersentia.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scandinavian legal systems adopted their civil law conceptions through the influence of law schools and commercial and corporations law are similar to European laws. Further, modern social welfare and human rights legislation has strong connections with the international laws. Scandinavian law, with a foundation of its customary laws, is pliable and less authoritarian than other European legal systems as it is relatively less restrictive. The laws focus greatly on rules, principles and precedents that have developed in practice, especially in courts. Further, most laws are judge-made, and as the principle of stare decisis does not apply, the courts are open to reflect the ever-changing social conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, M. (2018).

==Sources of Law==

Although each Nordic state follows either a common or civil law system, it is proclaimed that these Scandinavian countries have adopted [[jurisprudence]] that falls neither in the civil law system nor the [[common law]] system.

All five of the Nordic states have their own respective Constitutions upon which their legislative framework is based upon. Whilst these Constitutions are all separate in nature, due to the legal cooperation between the Scandinavian states, the Constitutions are similar in their aims and contribute to the laws holistically.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, H. (2017). LibGuides: Nordic countries: IALS Library Guides. [online] Libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk. Available at: https://libguides.ials.sas.ac.uk/nordic [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norwegian law===

Norway’s legal system is a civil law system. Therefore, legislation is the predominant source of law, however not the sole one. According to legal scholar and author Torstein Eckhoff, there are seven sources of Norwegian law, including:

1.	Legislation;
2.	Legislative history;
3.	Case law;
4.	Administrative practice;
5.	Customary law;
6.	Legal literature; and
7.	Equity

Due to the Nordic legal cooperation, this list is not exhaustive. Laws are informed and correspond to the other Scandinavian states. The three distinctive sections of Norwegian law are the Constitution, then ordinary statutes and followed by the regulations derived from statutes &lt;ref&gt;Nyulawglobal.org. (2017). Guide to Legal Research in Norway - GlobaLex. [online] Available at: http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Norway.html#_1.1_Norwegian_Law. [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Norway adopted its [[Constitution]] in 1814 and holds the position of the second oldest hand-written Constitution in the world which is still in use. The Constitution consists of a set of Norwegian laws based upon the legal principles of sovereignty, the separation and division of powers and universal human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Constitution forms three distinctive branches of government, including:

1.	Legislative power vested in the Storting;
2.	Executive power vested in the King in Council, Regjeringen; and
3.	Judicial power vested in the Supreme Court, the subsidiary courts and in the Court of Impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 49 and 75 of the Constitution highlight the principles of sovereignty whereby it states that the people of Norway issue laws, make decisions regarding the states’ funds, impose taxes and supervise authorities, including the Government, by way of the Storting.&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Stated within Article 3 of the Constitution, the executive power is held by the King, or the Queen. However, according to Article 27, Royal laws are adopted by the King in Council. Such laws are validated by the Prime Minister, the political leadership upon which the constitutional and senatorial responsibility is bestowed.&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Published by the Faculty of Law in Oslo and Fagbokforlaget, [[Norges Lover]] Norway’s most comprehensive code of law. It consists of one volume published annually and used by law students, legal professional and officers of the court. The code contains the Constitution, legislation in force, adopted legislation yet to take effect and also pre-1814 legislation which is still valid and in force.&lt;ref&gt;NORGES LOVER. (2018). [S.l.]: VIGMOSTAD &amp; BJORKE.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the Storting only passes entirely new Acts and abolishes the old Acts,&lt;ref&gt;Stortinget. (1814). The Constitution of Norway. [online] Available at: https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; amendments to legislation are integrated in the existing statutes. The Norges Lover follows a chronological order by date of enactment, excluding the Constitution, which is placed at the front of the code.

===Swedish law===

Swedish law is a civil law system manifested on statutory laws. 

Sweden’s Constitution consists of the four “fundamental laws”, consisting of:

1.	The Instrument of Government (1974);
2.	The Act of Succession (1810);
3.	The Freedom of the Press Act (1949); and
4.	The Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (1991)&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of Sweden. (2016). [ebook] Stockholm: Sveriges Riksdag, pp.9-22. Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/globalassets/07.-dokument--lagar/the-constitution-of-sweden-160628.pdf [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the above, there is also the Riksdag Act which translates to the Parliament Act (1974), however this is not classified as a law fundamental to the state. 

The fundamental laws take precedence over all other laws. The written Constitution regulates the Riksdag – the Swedish Parliament, the appointing of Government officials and it sets out the key ways in which Sweden’s authorities shall function.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of Sweden. (2016). [ebook] Stockholm: Sveriges Riksdag, pp.9-22. Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/globalassets/07.-dokument--lagar/the-constitution-of-sweden-160628.pdf [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Swedish Code of Statutes is Sweden’s official compilation of all laws enacted by the Riksdag and regulations issued by the Government.&lt;ref&gt;Riksdagen.se. (2018). Documents and laws. [online] Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/en/documents-and-laws/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

This Code is enacted into statutory law, however it forms its own unified legal code containing all of the laws passed by the Government, including civil and criminal law, procedure, regulations, legal information and all other legal articles pertinent to Sweden. Although Sweden follows a civil law system, this Code of Statutes combines both statutory and civil law. The Code is amended frequently and amendments are integrated to the existing statutes. Similar to Norway, Sweden’s Constitution is placed at the front of its Code of Statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Riksdagen.se. (2018). Documents and laws. [online] Available at: http://www.riksdagen.se/en/documents-and-laws/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish law===

Finnish laws and legal traditions are influenced by Swedish law and holistically also the Scandinavian and German legal families. Based on civil law tradition, the law of Finland consists mostly of statutory law enacted by the Parliament of Finland. Finland’s Constitution takes supreme authority and sets out the procedures and guidelines for the application of legislation. Similar to other civil law systems, judicial decisions are generally not authoritative in nature and there is often not many judge-made laws. Further, Supreme Court decisions may be cited, however they are not actually binding. 

Being a member of the European Union, Finland enacts many European Union laws and implements the European Union directives in its national laws. &lt;ref&gt;Nyulawglobal.org. (2017). Guide to Legal Research in Norway - GlobaLex. [online] Available at: http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Norway.html#_1.1_Norwegian_Law. [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;


Finland’s Constitution came into force in 2000 and aims to regulate legislation and the manner in which government power is exercised. It specifies the primary rules, values and principles of the Finnish government and democracy. Furthermore, it details the significance of the relationship between the citizen and the government. In relation to the government, the Constitution governs the use of government power, the government organisation and the authorities and organs of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Nyulawglobal.org. (2017). Guide to Legal Research in Norway - GlobaLex. [online] Available at: http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Norway.html#_1.1_Norwegian_Law. [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Danish law===

The Danish legal system is a combination of public and civil law. This mix of law suggests that Danish law focuses on societal interests and also that the states organs are vested with greater authority than the courts in applying legal frameworks. 

The legal system primarily consists of statutory regulation, principles and laws. Similar to the other Nordic states, although the courts have authority to create laws, the statutory law is supplemented by customary law and case law. Alike all other Scandinavian countries, the Constitution of Denmark is at the top of the legal hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Eurojuris España. (2018). Denmark Legal Guide. [online] Available at: http://www.asociacion-eurojuris.es/en/denmark-legal-guide/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

Adopted in 1953, the principle aim of Denmark’s Constitution was to abolish monarchy by limiting the King’s power and introduce a system of democracy. It establishes the framework for governance by way of structure, procedure, power and the duties bestowed on the Danish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Eurojuris España. (2018). Denmark Legal Guide. [online] Available at: http://www.asociacion-eurojuris.es/en/denmark-legal-guide/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Danish Parliament known is not permitted to make laws which may invalidate or contradict the Constitutional Act. Although Denmark does not have a court to try constitutional matters, laws can be declared unconstitutional and void by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Eurojuris España. (2018). Denmark Legal Guide. [online] Available at: http://www.asociacion-eurojuris.es/en/denmark-legal-guide/ [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Icelandic law===

Iceland has a civil law system and therefore its main sources of law include the Constitution, statutory legislation and regulatory statutes. Complementing sources include precedent and customary laws followed by Scandinavia. 

The most recent Constitution of Iceland is of 1999. It is regarded as the supreme law of Iceland and highlights the leadership structures of the country and preserves the human rights of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Sff.is. (2018). The legal system in Iceland | sff.is. [online] Available at: https://sff.is/en/legislation/legal-system-iceland [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the Constitution from which it is influenced and regulated, legislation in Iceland takes primacy as a source of law. The increasing propensity of social, economic and political trends has resulted in a greater significance of laws by way of new general acts targeting niche sectors such as customs, respect of children, banking, communication and corporations’ laws.&lt;ref&gt;Sff.is. (2018). The legal system in Iceland | sff.is. [online] Available at: https://sff.is/en/legislation/legal-system-iceland [Accessed 6 Nov. 2018].
&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Academic views on Scandinavian law==

The Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law (SISL) proclaims that as all of the Nordic states follow the civil law system, Scandinavian law as a whole should be classified as civil law as opposed to common law. Due to the fact that common law has taken little precedence in the development of law in the Nordic countries and additionally that all legal concepts presently adopted in Scandinavian law have been derived from the civil Germanic law, the SISL views Scandinavian law as a civil law system.&lt;ref&gt;Wahlgren, P. (2007). What is Scandinavian law? Social private law. Stockholm: Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law, Law Faculty, Stockholm University.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12368">The [[Serbian language]] is one of the officially recognized minority languages in [[Croatia]]. It is primarily used by the [[Serbs of Croatia]]. The [[Croatian Constitution]], [[Croatian Constitutional law on national minorities rights]], [[Law on Education in language and script of national minorities]] and [[Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities]] define the public co-official usage of Serbian in Croatia. Serbian and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] are two [[standard language|standardized]] [[Variety (linguistics)#Standard varieties|varieties]] of the [[Pluricentric language|pluricentric]] [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian language]]. Majority of Serbs of Croatia use [[Ijekavian]] pronunciation of [[Proto-Slavic]] vowel [[Yat|jat]] except in the [[Podunavlje]] region in [[Vukovar-Srijem]] and [[Osijek-Baranja]] Counties where local Serb population use [[Ekavian]] pronunciation. Post-[[World War II]] and [[Croatian War of Independence]] settlers in Podunavlje which have come from [[Bosnia]], [[Dalmatia]] or Western Slavonia either use their original Ijekavian pronunciation, adopted Ekavian pronunciation or both of them depending on context. In 2011 Census majority of Serbs of Croatia declared Croatian standardized variety as their first language with Ijekavian pronunciation always being required standard form in Croatian. While Serbian variety recognizes both pronunciations as standard Ekavian is the more common one as it is the dominant one in [[Serbia]], with Ijekavian being mostly limited to [[Republika Srpska]] in Bosnia, [[Montenegro]] and Croatia.

==Other forms of cultural autonomy==
Various minority organizations use Serbian in their work. One of them, [[Association for Serbian language and literature in Croatia]] from [[Vukovar]] is a nonprofit professional organization that brings together scientists and technical workers in the Republic of Croatia engaged in studying and teaching of Serbian language and literature.

==The co-official use at local government level==
The [[Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities]] provides for a mandatory co-official use of minority languages in [[municipalities of Croatia]] with at least one third of members of ethnic minoritiy. Municipalities [[Dvor, Croatia|Dvor]], [[Gvozd]], [[Jagodnjak]], [[Šodolovci]], [[Borovo, Croatia|Borovo]], [[Trpinja]], [[Markušica]], [[Negoslavci]], [[Biskupija]], [[Ervenik]], [[Kistanje]], [[Gračac]], [[Udbina]], [[Vrbovsko]], [[Donji Kukuruzari]], [[Erdut]] and [[Vukovar]], according to the provisions of law, are obliged to grant equal co-official use of Serbian language and Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. Law enforcement is facing great resistance in the part of the majority population, most notably in the case of Vukovar where it led to [[2013 Anti-Cyrillic protests in Croatia]].

In [[psychology]], education and [[social work]] practice, '''social role valorization''' ('''SRV''') is the name given to an analysis of human relationships and human services, formulated in 1983 by [[Wolf Wolfensberger]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1991). "A Brief Introduction to Social Role Valorization as a High-Order Concept for Structuring Human Services. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Training Institute on Human Services Planning, Leadership and Change Agentry.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1983). Social Role Valorization: A proposed new term for the principle of normalization. "Mental Retardation", 21(6): 234-239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1985). Social role valorization: A new insight, a new term, for normalization. "Australian Association for the Mentally Retarded Journal", 9(1): 4–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, S. &amp; Wolfensberger, W. (1999). An overview of social role valorization. In: R.J. Flynn &amp; R. A. LeMay, "A Quarter Century of Normalization and Social Role Valorization". Ottawa, Canada: University of Ottawa Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as the successor to his earlier formulation of the principle of [[Normalization (sociology)|normalization]] which is attributed to Nirje, Wolfensberger, and Bank-Mikkelsen worldwide (Lemay, 1995; Wolfensberger, 1972).&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1972). "The Principle of Normalization in Human Services". Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nirje, B. (1985). The basis and logic of the normalization principle. "Australian and New Zealand Journal of Developmental Disabilities", 17(2): 265-267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nirje, B. (1992). Bank-Mikkelsen: Founder of Normalization Principle. "News &amp; Notes", 5(2), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is based on the idea that society tends to identify groups of people as fundamentally 'different', and of less value than everyone else. It catalogs the methods of this 'devaluation' and analyzes its effects. It may be used by those seeking to counteract these methods and effects. A recent compilation of normalization and social role valorization was by Flynn and LeMay (1999); their work remains important today in Europe, New Zealand and Australia among other countries.

==Overview of normalization and social role valorization==
Although normalization and the initial versions of SRV were described as an 'Ideology', the most recent formulation explicitly denies that SRV is about what ''should'' be done, and reinforces that SRV is intended to be a tool for analysis of the process and effects of Societal Devaluation.  Wolfensberger's most recent (1999) definition of SRV is: "the application of what science can tell us about the enablement, establishment, enhancement, maintenance, and/or defence of valued social roles for people" (Susan Thomas and Wolf Wolfensberger in Flynn and Lemay 1999,  p.&amp;nbsp;125). Susan Thomas, long time professional educator with Wolfensberger, continues to teach through the Institute at Syracuse University as of 2012. University students and training institute colleagues can be found worldwide with many internationally seeking collaborative projects with the Wolfensberger (e.g., now Rannveig Traustadottir, now Gender and Disability Chair at the University of Iceland).

Social role valorization (SRV) is a  relationship theory of empirical knowledge for the design and rendering of formal and informal services and relationships to people with any need or condition, especially those who are devalued or are at risk.  Social role valorization is intended to address the social and psychological wounds that are inflicted on vulnerable people because they are devalued, that so often come to define their lives and that in some instances wreak lifelong havoc on those who are close to them.

SRV does not in itself propose a 'goal'.  However a person who has a goal of improving the lives of devalued people may choose to use insights gained from SRV to cause change.  They may do so by attempting to create or support socially valued roles for people in their society, because if a person holds valued social roles, a person is highly likely to receive from society those good things in life that are available or at least the opportunities for obtaining them. In other words, all sorts of good things that other people are able to convey are almost automatically apt to be accorded to a person who holds societally valued roles, at least within the resources and norms of his/her society.

Social role valorization identifies social devaluation as a critical human experience that has long-term effects on the individual.  SRV is designed to raise consciousness about the fate of socially devalued persons.  SRV holds that the human being is vulnerable to the regard of others for both the heights of edification and the depths of degradation.

An understanding of social role valorization can lead to ideas about how to improve the lives of people who are devalued by society. These can be seen to have two themes – firstly, removing devaluing features (for instance people being segregated from society in a building along with others perceived to belong to the same group), and secondly taking action that leads to people being valued. On one the approaches of SRV involves socially valued persons allying themselves with socially devalued persons. This alliance will unify people, broaden acceptance of differences, and encourage coexistence.

SRV is a realistic if not pessimistic sense of human behaviour, holding that human beings are imperfect and capable of great evils even if they are occasionally saintly, heroic or kind.

Social role valorization is designed to address the social and psychological wounds that get inflicted on vulnerable people because they are devalued, that so often come to define their lives, and that in some instances wreak lifelong havoc on them and those who are close and committed to them.

==Basic structure==
SRV is a description of how societally differentiated people are devalued, assigned low-value roles, and treated poorly, often to the extent of risk to their own lives. This poor treatment is given to members of any group that is given low value by powerful forces in society.

SRV considers only those things that can be known from a scientific perspective. In itself it does not subscribe to a particular ideology – it does not say what should be done and it does not say what is morally correct.

However, SRV does understand that human interaction is impossible without a moral code and so SRV can be used to suggest what is desirable given the spoken or unspoken moral code of a particular society or individual. Consequently, it is necessary to understand what sort of moral code and societal expectations might be around the implementation of any application of SRV. A consideration of the concepts of humanity and morality place SRV in an appropriate context.

Any particular human society will have a set of written and unwritten rules about who is a member of that society and about how members of that society should act, and what treatment is due to non-members of that society. These rules are often set down in codes of law and in religious texts. Every society has such a moral code.

Support for SRV can be found throughout the human sciences. Biology, evolutionary biology, sociology, economics, psychology, and anthropology all lend strands to SRV. Even history and geography have ideas to contribute. Although SRV is not in itself a science, it is based on empirically produced disciplines.

===Science in psychology, special education and philosophy===

Psychology and philosophy tell us that there is considerable doubt about the common sense idea that we have total free will; what we do is often societally or physically caused by unconscious mechanisms.

Science tells us that people do not often act as completely free-thinking individuals, but in fact occupy particular social strata and  roles that organize and simplify their social communication. Particular people may be forced into a negative role which they do not desire.

Science tells us that individuals and groups will place positive and negative values onto other individuals and groups. This assignation of value may lead to a process of devaluation.

Complex societal forces mediate the exercise of power and social control in a society. These forces are often not well understood by individuals in that society.

Individuals in a society are very aware of similarities and differences between members of that society. This is societal differentiation.

Such difference groups may include people with the following differences from the valued norm:
*People with mental difficulties (including those states labelled as mental illness and learning disability)
*People with physical capability differences (including those labelled as having difficulties with mobility, body control and bodily integrity)
*People with physical appearance differences (including those labelled as facially disfigured, unusual appearance, overweight or underweight)
*People perceived to be of a different ethnic or racial group
*People of different gender or sexuality
*People who are labelled criminals (whether legally or morally so or not)
*People who do not accept societal norms for whatever reason
*People who use drugs (including those who use alcohol and nicotine as well as those who use chemicals more usually called drugs in the society)
*People who exhibit lack of control according to the expectations of that society

Psychology shows us that perception and interpretation are complex subjects, highly reliant on beliefs and prejudices. Human perception and interpretation is complicated and often not in accord with what 'common sense' tells us that it is.

Learning and particularly imitation are the natural modes of behavior formation and are important in developing useful as well as damaging performances.

Image and image transfer are important subjects when considering how people interpret each other and their own surroundings.

Performance, reputation and grouping determine how people are seen and interpreted.

===Summary of relationship to theories of power, deviancy and role relations===

So, we may summarise: people who differ in any way from societal expectations or desirability, where this difference is negatively valued, will be badly treated by that society.

Powerful groups in society will:

*Define people as different
*Treat people with the same or similar differences as a group.
*If the difference is seen as negative, it will treat such groups badly.
*It will assign negative deviancy roles to such groups and people. (These deviancy roles include: not human (animal-like, plant-like, less than human, not yet human, used to be human, alien), waste, trivium (clown-like, humorously insignificant), threat, burden of charity, and death related roles.)

SRV suggests that role messages are largely conveyed by image, whether of the individual or of their surroundings (including accompanying people). A person's potential roles may be limited or assigned by the company they keep, the surroundings in which they live, or the activities they engage in.

SRV suggests that Role Occupancy is dependent on apparent competency in that role. So the availability of roles may be limited or assigned by the person's ability (or, more importantly, the lack of ability) to perform the necessary role requirements for the effective performance of that role.

====Effects related to role theories: good things and devaluation====
People cast into such negative roles will be denied the good things in life:

The good things in life:
*Family or small intimate group
*An intermediate but still small-scale group
*A transcendental belief system
*Absence of imminent threats of extreme privation
*To be viewed as a human and treated with respect
*To be treated justly
*Friends
*Work, especially meaningful work
*Opportunities and expectations to discover and develop skills, abilities, gifts and talents
*To be dealt with honestly
*To be treated as an individual
*Access to the 'sites of everyday life'
*Being able to contribute, and having ones contributions recognised as valuable

Further, such groups will be damaged in the following ways:

'Wounds' or bad things which happen to devalued persons:

*''Relegation'' to low ('deviant') status and rejection, perhaps by family, neighbours, community, society, service workers, leading to:
**Cast into one or more historical deviancy roles
**Symbolical stigmatising, 'marking', 'deviancy-imaging', 'branding'
**Being multiply jeopardised, scapegoated
**Distantiation: usually via segregation and also congregation
**Loss of control, perhaps even autonomy and freedom, leading to:
***Discontinuity with the physical environment and objects
***Social and relationship discontinuity, even abandonment
***Absence or loss of natural/freely given relationships, and substitution of artificial/'bought' ones
***Deindividualization, leading to:
****Involuntary material poverty, material/financial exploitation
****Impoverishment of experience, especially that of the typical, valued world
****Exclusion from knowledge of, and participation in, higher order value systems (e.g. religion) that give meaning and direction to life, and provide community
****Having one's life 'wasted'
****Being the object of brutalisation, 'killing thoughts', and death making

=====Other reactions to bad treatment=====

Additional mental and behavioral response patterns that are evidence of disturbed interactions with the world, and that are engendered by certain wounds and wound clusters, are:

*Feeling like being an alien in the world
*A sense of worthlessness, dislike of self, despair
*Insecurity
*Failure sets and avoidance mentalities
*Awareness of being a source of anguish to those who love one
*Searching for the abandoner
*Fantasy and inventions about relationships that do not exist, and may never have existed
*Seeking/demanding physical contact, perhaps insatiably
*Problematic testing of genuineness of personal and social relationships, particularly new ones
*Turning the hurt into resentment or hatred towards privileged people, benefactors, society, or God
*Withdrawing from human contact, perhaps even from reality
*Rage, perhaps violence
*A sapping of energy, both physical and mental, resulting in a lowering of intelligent behavior, and possibly even of intelligence

The coping mechanism is to avoid negative roles and outcomes:
*SRV suggests that in trying to avoid the above, it is most useful to seek positive valued roles for the devalued people and groups.
*SRV suggests that such role re-valorization may be considerably more effective than other means of assisting people in devalued states.
*Consequently, SRV suggests that enhancing competency and image (of the person and their surroundings) will result in positive roles being made a possibility for devalued people.
*If such positive roles are supported and defended, and further positive roles are sought and achieved, then the devalued person will be more likely to achieve more of the good things in life, and avoid the Wounds and other Negative Effects secondary to Devaluation.

=====Positive actions at different levels=====
In order to ensure that positive roles are available to persons who have been devalued by society, it is necessary to consider actions at multiple levels:

*The level of the person themselves (personal appearance and competency)
*The level of the usual immediate environment of the person (where they live, work, learn and play)
*The level of all the life arenas in which a person may engage (everywhere else they engage with society)
*The level of society itself (how one may effect political, legal and moral change regarding the devaluation of individuals)

SRV suggests that by these means, people who have been devalued by society may be rescued (or may rescue themselves) from the effects of devaluation, and may manage to live their lives occupying Valued Roles and become seen as valued by society. Other theories regarding "mentally handicapped" individuals include consciousness raising and implications for normalization from the women's movement, related self-advocacy movements in special education and rehabilitation, and now the new movement to community inclusion as represented at the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006).

==Criticisms==
{{POV section|date=August 2012}}
# SRV has had a lifespan of barely a generation even if taking into account its predecessor normalization (resulting in Nordic countries in the first integrated generation worldwide). According to one editor, this timeframe compared to the history of asylums, should give anyone pause in granting to it a permanency in societies which is still being established and solidified. History would predict a period of transinstitutionalization and retrenchment, and again further efforts to develop and promote and strengthen community. 
# SRV does not consistently raise consciousness and guarantee concern about socially devalued persons in part because it has a moral base in societies which are struggling with ethical concerns in government and administration. Ideologies cannot ultimately control the character of their adherents even though they are influential. Further, their theoretical value can be nullified if used wrongly. More often, theories such as SRV are analyzed and presented inaccurately by their opponents, and a real debate seldom is forthcoming.
# Not all alliances between socially valued and devalued persons are moral, fruitful and advantageous which follows the literature on attempts at co-optation of all civil rights movements.
# Knowing how social devaluation works in society may still leave one impotent against it. However, efforts at social valuations, in the context of positivism, can counteract for individuals and families the literature's "downward spiral".
# SRV's societal impact, thus far, is largely confined to several narrow human service fields.  In part, this factor is due to the insular nature of intellectual and developmental disabilities, and the categorical division of state agencies and delivery system.
# SRV is open to criticism because of the later politico-moral stance (Christian, right wing conservatism) of its founder, Wolf Wolfensberger, in which he advances a non-mainstream response to the plight of the wounded (his conceptual term) in society.  This response may be seen as anti-death (opposing all abortion and all forms of euthanasia), morally conservative, anti-bourgeoise feminist (stressing the 'importance' of motherhood rather than parenthood, and persistently relegating women to subsidiary power roles), homophobic, anti psychiatry and religiose. 
This criticism appears unjust in that Wolfensberger is an early proponent of the rights of people with mental retardation to marry, while other professionals placed the same individuals in institutional abuse and confinement. His doctoral students hold leadership positions in gender and disability, and he is associated with liberals in his own academic department who support actions in that context to address entrenched societal discrimination.
# Although Wolf Wolfensberger attempts to isolate SRV from his underlying beliefs, SRV may be negatively affected by this association for those whom disagree with these moral and religious positions (which of course, include a decade of students and colleagues as well). Reference to the series of Pamphlets entitled 'TIPS' and edited by Wolf Wolfensberger provides graphic evidence of the politico-moral stance of the lead proponents of SRV. This criticism has resulted in liberals and moderates involved in broader discrimination movements (e.g., gay civil unions, Black &amp; Grey Panthers, Red and Pink Hat Societies) to limit the involvement of SRV adherents in their work.
# SRV, with roots in normalization and related citizen advocacy, supports unpaid relationships, giving, volunteerism, life commitments, and commitments to new approaches to shared living, including the co-residency model and the L'Arche communities. 
It can be suggested that all constructed attempts to re-valorize the roles and raise the social status of marginalised individuals and groups are hollow as they are artificial, but of course, government is responsible to provide minimum wage laws, to increase worker benefits, to maintain entitlements, to provide quality housing and beneficial and affordable health care. 
In other words, the person providing the re-valorization efforts such as a social worker or supported employment worker is paid to do his or her job, and is not helping the marginalised person out of genuine interpersonal motivation such as friendship, attraction or emotional attachment, and people are well aware of this monetary role in professions in human services. Therefore, any re-valorized role is viewed by those outside the relationship as non-genuine, unstable, though new evidence and theory (e.g., theories of social acceptance, versus deviance) suggests that beneficence and social acceptance are active and result in positive life outcomes. Thus, paid roles (sometimes preferred in modern life) would tend to negate the security-giving benefits that valued, familial and friendship roles would normally provide.

==Misconceptions==
Some criticism of social role valorization is said by its advocates to be because of misconceptions about it. Such misconceptions include:
* that the theory sees that some people have more value, and others less (the theory speaks about how people are valued by society, in the assumption that all actually have equal value),
* that social role valorization encourages action which supports the valuing of certain sections of society or behaviours (the theory actually encourages action that helps society to value groups previously 'devalued'),
* that social role valorization works against self-advocacy efforts by a group of devalued people (the theory describes how labelling and segregating people supports social devaluation, but says nothing to deny that good can come from groups identifying themselves as having common cause or as having experiences or cultures in common).

The theory of social role valorization is best understood as referring primarily to extreme devaluation (such that few people care much about what happens to an individual or group, or even actively look for their eradication) not more subtle (but still damaging) devaluation such as occurs between different social classes or between genders.

==Comparative community theories==
Social role valorization (SRV), similar to normalization, is a foundational theory with roots in intellectual and developmental disabilities, often termed learning disabilities in Europe. It is a revolutionary concept which took roots in the deinstitutionalization and community integration movements of the 1970s and 1980s which aligned themselves with its broad concepts and goals more so than with the specifics of the theory, goals and formulations itself. SRV and normalization adherents, in contrast, are committed first to the specific theories and have tended to be reluctant to engage in academic theoretical discussions with related theorists (e.g., independent and supportive living; support and empowerment paradigms; user-and-family directed services; self-determination and choice theories). In addition, other giants in community development such as Gunnar Dybwad, advisors to Presidents in the US, Brandeis University professor, friend of the Center on Human Policy, and former Arc-US director, often are missed in contrasting theory formulations.

SRV is supportive of the development of community paradigms (e.g., Schwartz, McKnight, O'Brien, Taylor, Racino, Wehman, Roberts, Towell, Lakin, Bruininks, Braddock, Hemp, Rogan, Anthony, Carling, Seekins, Condeluci &amp; Gretz-Lasky)&lt;ref&gt;Condeluci, A. &amp; Gretz-Lasky. (1987). Social role valorization: A model of community reentry. "Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation", 2(1): 49-56.&lt;/ref&gt; which were necessary to replace the institutional paradigms of the pre-expose era, however, with community paradigms taking over 20 years to become the mainstream academic publications. Today, new goals of integration, a basic principle of normalization, involve the integration of family studies to include families with a disability family member, integration of financing (e.g., housing and homes), long-term services and supports development (e.g., personal assistance, support aides for homes and families), and modernization to areas such as green and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2014). "Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US". New York, NY: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian '''Stanley Keith Pearl''' was a [[sapper]] with the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I]]. His exact dates of birth and death are unclear. After enlisting at the town of [[Ulverstone]] in [[Tasmania]] on 9 November 1915 at twenty-one years of age, Pearl, in August 1916, became a sapper with the Australian 5 Field Company Engineers.&lt;ref name=Saunders2016&gt;Nicholas J. Saunders, "Sapper Stanley Keith Pearl," in ''Sappers &amp; Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches'', Lisa Slade (Adelaide: Art Gallery of South Australia, 2016), 15. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Embarkation&gt;Australian War Memorial, [https://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1778164/ "First World War Embarkation Rolls: Stanley Keith Pearl"], ''[[Australian War Memorial]]'', n.d., accessed 5 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slade2015&gt;Lisa Slade, "Trench Art: Sappers and Shrapnel – on Trench Art and Material Culture in Contemporary Art," ''Art &amp; War: Badlands'', in ''Artlink'' 35, no. 1 (March 2015), n.p. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016&gt;Kerry Neale, [https://www.awm.gov.au/blog/2016/04/28/decoration-destruction-first-world-war-trench-art-sapper-pearl/ "Decoration from Destruction: the First World War Trench Art of Sapper Pearl"], ''[[Australian War Memorial]]'', 28 April 2016, accessed 5 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He performed this role for the duration of the war.&lt;ref name=Saunders2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slade2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; Many details on Pearl himself remain a mystery. A consideration of the phenomenal [[trench art]] collection that he produced, however, helps to piece together essential information about him.

== World War I ==

Pearl was a [[joiner]] by trade whose father was Charles Pearl of Ulverstone, Tasmania.&lt;ref name=Embarkation /&gt; Pearl was Anglican.&lt;ref name=Embarkation /&gt; He embarked from Sydney to Alexandria and then the [[Western Front (World War I)]] in France aboard HMAT ''Orsova'' on 11 March 1916.&lt;ref name=Saunders2016 /&gt; He undertook a brief stint with the 8 Field Company Engineers (Reinforcement 4) before joining the 5 Field Company Engineers.&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Australian Imperial Force (AIF) Project, [https://www.aif.adfa.edu.au/showPerson?pid=237003 "Stanley Keith Pearl"], (n.d.) ''[[University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra, Australian Defence Force Academy]]'', accessed 29 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl’s [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)]] and [[British War Medal]] are held in the Australian War Memorial’s collection.&lt;ref&gt;Australian War Memorial collection, [https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/REL/21088.002 "Victory Medal: Sapper S K Pearl, 5 Field Company Engineers, AIF"], accessed 29 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Australian War Memorial collection, [https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/REL/21088.001 "British War Medal 1914-20: Sapper S K Pearl, 5 Field Company Engineers, AIF"], accessed 29 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearl produced a phenomenal collection of trench art between 1916 and 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl donated his trench art objects to the [[Australian War Memorial]] but whether this reflects the full extent of that which he produced in the context of war remains a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; A total of fifteen of Pearl’s [[Work of art|oeuvre]] are held in the Australian War Memorial’s Military Heraldry collection.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AWMConline&gt;Australian War Memorial collection, [https://www.awm.gov.au/search/all/?query=sapper+stanley+keith+pearl&amp;submit=&amp;op=Search&amp;format=list&amp;section%5B0%5D=collections "Collections search: Sapper Stanley Keith Pearl"], accessed 4 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Military shell cases, other parts of shells, badges and buttons were just some of the war-related materials used by Pearl to assemble everyday objects such as a clock, a map of Tasmania and a hat pin stand, as is evidenced by the accessibility and digitisation of his work on the War Memorial’s online collection (see external links for selection of images).&lt;ref name=AWMConline /&gt; One can become more familiar with Pearl’s work through such a collection as it displays images of the objects together with Pearl’s own field notes. The accompanying field notes that Pearl documented alongside each piece are fascinating as this was not a feature typically associated with First World War trench art.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl used matter-of-fact language where tales of death became mere descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.22, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl’s field notes and his details on the First World War embarkation roll are useful additional [[primary source]]s for [[historian]]s, [[art historian]]s and [[anthropologist]]s.

==Post-war and legacy==

There is no evidence to suggest that Pearl is survived by anyone, nor have any photographs of him been discovered.&lt;ref name=Mitzevich2016&gt; Nick Mitzevich, "Director’s Foreword," in ''Sappers &amp; Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches'', Lisa Slade (Adelaide: Art Gallery of South Australia, 2016), 8. &lt;/ref&gt; He is an "enigma." &lt;ref name=Mitzevich2016 /&gt; It is therefore Pearl’s material existence in the form of trench art that survives, the power of which is subsequently elevated. The creative and artistic vision of Pearl to contribute to the [[material culture]] of World War I, of which trench art is a fascinating example, has meant that his name lives on through these well-crafted, striking objects.&lt;ref name=Saunders2000&gt;Nicholas J. Saunders, "Bodies of Metal, Shells of Memory: ‘Trench Art’, and the Great War Re-cycled," ''Journal of Material Culture'' 5, no. 1 (2000), 45. &lt;/ref&gt; Pearl was unconsciously engaging with features of material culture such as [[bricolage]] and recyclia in producing trench art.&lt;ref&gt; Corinne A. Kratz, "Rethinking Recyclia," ''African Arts'' 28, no. 3 (Summer 1995), 7, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2000, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that he was a joiner pre-war also speaks to this refined, craftsmanship-like quality to his pieces.

Pearl survived World War I. During March of 1919, Pearl returned to Tasmania, although soon relocated to Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; He began working for the Australian War Memorial in 1941, the year that it opened, and continued to do so until he retired.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; He worked as a carpenter and senior tradesman at the War Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; The electoral roll details Pearl’s exact position at the War Memorial as an ‘installation manager.’&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; Such hands-on employment echoes his pre-war occupation as a joiner.

A recent exhibition entitled ''Sappers &amp; Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches'' at the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]] showcased Pearl’s trench art. The exhibition presented Pearl’s pieces alongside other First World War trench art objects and more recent works of art that reflected on war today. Such a display, in bringing together the historical and the contemporary, was the first opportunity whereby the trench art of Pearl was exposed to a wider audience.&lt;ref name=Mitzevich2016 /&gt; It is evidence that Pearl and his trench art collection hold an important relevance today and will continue to do so in the future, especially in studies of [[history]], [[art history]] and [[anthropology]].

'''Stoning''', or '''lapidation''', is a method of [[capital punishment]] whereby a group throws [[stones]] at a person until the subject dies. No individual among the group can be identified as the one who kills the subject. This is in contrast to the case of a judicial [[executioner]]. Often slower than other forms of execution, stoning within the context of contemporary [[Western culture]] is considered a form of [[Torturous death|execution by torture]].

Stoning is called ''[[rajm]]'' (Arabic: {{large|رجم}}) in Islamic literature, and is a legal or customary punishment found in the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Qatar]], [[Mauritania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Yemen]], northern [[Nigeria]], [[Aceh|Aceh Province]] of [[Indonesia]], [[Afghanistan]], and tribal parts of [[Pakistan]], including northwest [[Kurram Valley]] and the northwest Khwezai-Baezai region.&lt;ref name=ebtrf/&gt;&lt;ref name="cell phone stoning"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/special-report-the-punishment-was-death-by-stoning-the-crime-having-a-mobile-phone-8846585.html|author=Batha, Emma|title=Special report: The punishment was death by stoning.

In modern times, allegations of stoning are politically sensitive; the government of Iran, for example, describes allegations of stoning as political propaganda.&lt;ref name="iranprop"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4166137.stm |title=Iran denies execution by stoning |publisher=BBC News |date=11 January 2005 |accessdate=2010-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient history==

===Judaism===
[[File:Tissot The Sabbath-Breaker Stoned.jpg|thumb|The Sabbath-breaker Stoned. Artistic impression of episode narrated in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 15. [[James Tissot]] c.1900]]
{{Main|Religion and capital punishment#Judaism|Judaism and violence}}

====Torah====
The Jewish [[Torah]] (the first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]: [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]) serves as a common religious reference for [[Judaism]]. Stoning is the method of execution mentioned most frequently in the Torah. (Murder is not mentioned as an offense punishable by stoning, but it seems that a member of the victim's family was allowed to kill the murderer; see [[avenger of blood]].) The crimes punishable by stoning were the following:

* Touching [[Mount Sinai]] while God was giving [[Moses]] the [[Ten Commandments]], {{bible|Exodus|19:13}}
* An ox that gores someone to death should be stoned, {{bible|Exodus|21:28}}
* Breaking [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], {{bible|Numbers|15:32}}–36
* Giving one's "seed" (presumably [[ child sacrifice]] of one's offspring) "[[Moloch|to Molech]]" {{Bible|Leviticus| 20:2}}-5
* Having a "[[familiar spirit]]" (or being a [[necromancy|necromancer]]) or being a "[[magician (paranormal)|wizard]]", {{bible|Leviticus|20:27}}
* Enticing others to polytheism, {{bible|Deuteronomy|13:7}}–11
* [[Blasphemy|Cursing God]], {{bible|Leviticus|24:10}}–16
* Engaging in [[idolatry]], Deuteronomy 17:2–7; or seducing others to do so, {{bible|Deuteronomy|13:7}}–12
* "Rebellion" against parents, after repeated warnings, {{bible|Deuteronomy|21:18}}–21
* Getting married as though a virgin, when not a virgin, {{bible|Deuteronomy|22:13}}–21
* Sexual intercourse between a man and a woman engaged to another man in a town, since she did not cry out, {{bible|Deuteronomy|22:23}}–24; both parties should be stoned to death
* Forced sexual intercourse between a man and a woman engaged to another man in a field, where no one could hear her cries and save her, {{bible|Deuteronomy|22:25}}–27; the man should be stoned

Describing the stoning of those who entice others to [[Apostasy from Judaism|apostates from Judaism]], the [[Torah]] states:
{{quote|If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which [is] as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, ''Let us go and serve other gods'', which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; [Namely], of the gods of the people which [are] round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the [one] end of the earth even unto the [other] end of the earth; Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; ''neither shall thine eye pity him'', neither shalt thou spare, ''neither shalt thou conceal him: But thou shalt surely kill him''; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.|[[Deuteronomy]] 13:6–10&lt;ref&gt;[[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.apostolic-churches.net/bible/search/list/?search_book=Deuteronomy&amp;search_chapter_verse=13&amp;varchapter_verse=13:6 13:6–10]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A case noted in the Bible, not falling into any of the above categories, was that of [[Achan (biblical figure)|Achan]], stoned to death [[Collective responsibility|together with]] his sheep, other livestock and his children for having pillaged valuables from [[Jericho]] during [[Joshua]]'s [[Conquest of Canaan]].

====Mishna====
The [[Talmud]] describes four methods of execution: stoning, pouring molten lead down the throat of the condemned person, beheading, and strangulation (see [[Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism]]). The [[Mishna]] gives the following list of persons who should be stoned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] Chapter 7, p.&amp;nbsp;53a [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/sanhedrin7.html], in Hebrew: [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l4407.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt;

"To the following sinners stoning applies – אלו הן הנסקלין
*one who has had [[Incest|relations with his mother]] – הבא על האם
*with his father's wife – ועל אשת האב
*with his daughter-in-law – ועל הכלה
*a human male [[homosexuality|with a human male]] – ועל הזכור
*or [[zoophilia|with cattle]] – ועל הבהמה
*and the same is the case with a woman who uncovers herself before cattle – והאשה המביאה את הבהמה
*with a blasphemer – והמגדף
*an idolater – והעובד עבודת כוכבים
*he who sacrifices one of his children to Molech – והנותן מזרעו למולך
*one that occupies himself with familiar spirits – ובעל אוב
*a wizard – וידעוני
*one who violates Sabbath – והמחלל את השבת
*one who curses his father or mother – והמקלל אביו ואמו
*one who has assaulted a betrothed damsel – והבא על נערה המאורסה
*a seducer who has seduced men to worship idols – והמסית
*and the one who misleads a whole town – והמדיח
*a witch (male or female) – והמכשף
*a stubborn and rebellious son – ובן סורר ומורה"

As God alone was deemed to be the only arbiter in the use of capital punishment, not fallible people, the [[Sanhedrin]] made stoning a hypothetical upper limit on the severity of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] (Sanhedrin 41 a)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Botticcelli, Sandro - The Punishment of Korah and the Stoning of Moses and Aaron - 1481-82.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''[[The Punishment of Korah and the Stoning of Moses and Aaron]]'' (1480–1482), by [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].]]

Prior to early Christianity, particularly in the [[Mishnah]], doubts were growing in Jewish society about the effectiveness of capital punishment in general (and stoning in particular) in acting as a useful deterrent. Subsequently, its use was dissuaded by the central legislators. The Mishnah states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Sanhedrin that puts a man to death once in seven years is called destructive. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah says that this extends to a Sanhedrin that puts a man to death even once in seventy years. Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Tarfon say: Had we been in the Sanhedrin none would ever have been put to death. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: they would have multiplied shedders of blood in Israel.&lt;ref name = "Tractate makkos"&gt;[[makkot]] 1:10 March 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the following centuries the leading Jewish sages imposed so many restrictions on the implementation of capital punishment as to make it ''de facto'' illegal. The restrictions were to prevent execution of the innocent, and included many conditions for a testimony to be admissible that were difficult to fulfill.

Philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] wrote, "It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death."&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides, Sefer Hamitzvot, Negative Commandment no. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; He was concerned that the law guard its public perception, to preserve its majesty and retain the people's respect. He saw errors of commission as much more threatening to the integrity of law than errors of omission.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269–71 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mode of Judgment====
In rabbinic law, capital punishment may only be inflicted by the verdict of a regularly constituted court of twenty-three qualified members. There must be the most trustworthy and convincing testimony of at least two qualified eyewitnesses to the crime, who must also depose that the culprit had been forewarned of the criminality and the consequences of his project.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=128&amp;letter=C&amp;search=stoning |title=Capital Punishment |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The culprit must be a person of legal age and of sound mind, and the crime must be proved to have been committed of the culprit's free will and without the aid of others.

On the day the verdict is pronounced, the convict is led forth to execution. The [[Torah Laws|Torah law]] (Leviticus 19:18) prescribes, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself"; and the Rabbis maintain that this love must be extended beyond the limits of social intercourse in life, and applied even to the convicted criminal who, "though a sinner, is still thy brother" (Mak. 3:15; Sanh. 44a): "The spirit of love must be manifested by according him a decent death" (Sanh. 45a, 52a). Torah law provides (Deut. 24:16), "The parents shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the parents; every man shall be put to death for his own sins", and rabbinic jurisprudence follows this principle both to the letter and in spirit. A sentence is not attended by confiscation of the convict's goods; the person's possessions descend to their legal heirs.

The [[Talmud]] limits the use of the death penalty to Jewish criminals who:

* (A) while about to do the crime were warned not to commit the crime while in the presence of two witnesses (and only individuals who meet a strict list of standards are considered acceptable witnesses); and
* (B) having been warned, committed the crime in front of the same two witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/od/orthodoxfaqenkin/f/adultery_punish.htm |title=Ask the Orthodox Rabbi – Adultery in Judaism – Capital Punishment – Death Penalty |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-06-11 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, the Talmudic method of how stoning is to be carried out differs from mob stoning. According to the Jewish [[oral law]], after the Jewish criminal has been determined as guilty before the Great [[Sanhedrin]], the two valid witnesses and the sentenced criminal go to the edge of a two-story building. From there the two witnesses are to push the criminal off the roof of a two-story building. The two-story height is chosen as this height is estimated by the Talmud to effect a quick and painless demise but is not so high that the body will become dismembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Babylon Talmud|page= Sanhedrin 45a}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the criminal has fallen, the two witnesses are to drop a large boulder onto the criminal – requiring both of the witnesses to lift the boulder together. If the criminal did not die from the fall or from the crushing of the large boulder, then any people in the surrounding area are to quickly cause him to die by stoning with whatever rocks they can find.

Islamic [[sharia law]] is based on the [[Quran]] and the [[hadith]] as primary sources.

====Quran====
The Qur'an does not mention the act of [[Rajm|stoning (Rajm)]] for any crime.

Contrary to popular belief, the punishment for [[Zina|Adultery (Zina)]] in the Quran is not stoning to death but [[flogging]] with a 100 lashes (if the accuser can provide 4 witnesses to the act). If the accuser cannot produce 4 witnesses, he himself will be punished by flogging with 80 lashes.

{{quotation|"And those who accuse chaste women then do not bring four witnesses, flog them, (giving) eighty stripes, and do not admit any evidence from them ever; and these it is that are the transgressors. Except those who repent after this and act aright, for surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful." | Qur'an, Sura 24 (An-Nur), [[Ayah|ayat]] 4-5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|4|e=5|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Hadith====
[[Hadith]] refers to orally transmitted reports of statements or actions attributed to Muhammad. It was [[Hadith of Umar's ban on hadith|forbidden]] to record any Hadith on paper by Muhammad himself, [[Rashidun|the first 4 righteous Caliphs after the death of Muhammed]] and the later Caliphs. They believed the Quran was clear, fully detailed, complete, perfect and sufficient. There were fears that people would confuse hadith with the Qur'an, influence would seep in from other creeds, fear for fabrications by heretics,for personal or political gain. The first Hadith (that have survived) were recorded 200 years after the prophets death. There were tens of thousands [[Muhaddis|Muhaddiths]] who had each memorised at least 400,000 narrations along with the chain of narrators for each narration. Out of the hundreds of thousands of Hadith only a very, very small percentage were declared authentic (Sahih) by Hadith Scholars. Hadith Scholars used a number of methods of evaluation to determine the veracity of the recorded oral reports. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, the individual narrators involved in its transmission and cross-referincing the reports.

Muslims vary in degrees of acceptance of the Hadith. To many Sunnite and Shiite Muslims (different collections of) the hadith are almost on par with the Quran itself. To others the Quran is the word of Allah but the Hadith are the words and deeds of a human (the prophet Muhammed) transmitted down by the 200 years old fallible memory of men. Useful but not completely reliable. Some Muslims give little to no credence to the Hadith. Then there are also the different sets of Hadith accepted by different branches of Islam ([[Nikah mut'ah|Temporary Marriage]] or [[Female Genital Mutilation]]) who consider each other's Hadith fake.

Stoning in the [[Sunnah]] mainly follows on the Jewish stoning rules of the Torah. A few hadiths refer to Muhammad ordering the stoning of a married{{Failed verification|date=January 2018}} Jewish man and a married{{Failed verification|date=January 2018}} woman committing an illegal sexual act after consulting the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|9|93|633}}, {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|56|829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Narrated Ibn 'Umar: A Jew and Jewess were brought to the Prophet on a charge of committing an illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet asked the Jews, "What do you (usually) do with them?" They said, "We blacken their faces and disgrace them." He said, "Bring here the Torah and recite it, if you are truthful." They (fetched it and) came and asked a one-eyed man to recite. He went on reciting till he reached a portion on which he put his hand. The Prophet said, "Lift up your hand!" He lifted his hand up and behold, there appeared the verse of Ar-Rajm (stoning of the adulterers to death). Then he said, "O Muhammad! They should be stoned to death but we conceal this Divine Law among ourselves." Then the Prophet ordered that the two sinners be stoned to death and, and they were stoned to death, and I saw the man protecting the woman from the stones.| ''Volume 9, Book 93, Number 633: (See Hadith No. 809, Vol. 8)''}}

{{quotation|Narrated by 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:The Jews came to Allah's Apostle and told him that a man and a woman from amongst them had committed illegal sexual intercourse. Allah's Apostle said to them, "What do you find in the Torah (old Testament) about the legal punishment of Ar-Rajm (stoning)?" They replied, (But) we announce their crime and lash them." Abdullah bin Salam said, "You are telling a lie; Torah contains the order of Rajm." They brought and opened the Torah and one of them solaced his hand on the Verse of Rajm and read the verses preceding and following it. Abdullah bin Salam said to him, "Lift your hand." When he lifted his hand, the Verse of Rajm was written there. They said, "Muhammad has told the truth; the Torah has the Verse of Rajm. The Prophet then gave the order that both of them should be stoned to death. ('Abdullah bin 'Umar said, "I saw the man leaning over the woman to shelter her from the stones."|''Volume 4, Book 56, Number 829:''}}

In a few others, a Bedouin man is lashed, while a Jewish woman is stoned to death, for having sex outside marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|3|50|885}}, {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|3|49|860}}, {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|8|82|821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoning is described as punishment in multiple hadiths.&lt;ref&gt;Hadith Muslim 17:4192. Also, see the following: Bukhari 6:60:79, Bukhari 83:37, Muslim 17:4196, Muslim 17:4206, Muslim 17:4209, Ibn Ishaq 970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nisrine/&gt;&lt;ref name=kalu/&gt; [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] hadith collections differ because scholars from the two traditions differ as to the reliability of the narrators and transmitters and the [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imamah]]. Shi'a sayings related to stoning can be found in [[Kitab al-Kafi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafed.net/books/hadith/wasael-20/v16.html Rafed.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sunni sayings related to stoning can be found in the [[Sahih Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-Arabic-Ask_Scholar/FatwaA/FatwaA&amp;cid=1122528602718 Islamonline.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these hadiths, in some Muslim countries, married adulterers are sentenced to death, while consensual sex between unmarried people results in 100 lashes.

====Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh)====
Stoning (Arabic: رجم ''Rajm'', sometimes spelled as ''Rajam'') has been extensively discussed in the texts of early, medieval and modern era Islamic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ismail Poonwala (2004), The Pillars of Islam: Laws pertaining to human intercourse, Oxford University Press, Oxford University Press, pp. 448-457&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Fiqh|traditional jurisprudence]], zina can include adultery (of married parties), fornication (of unmarried parties), prostitution, [[bestiality]], and rape.&lt;ref name=Semerdjian&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Elyse|last=Semerdjian|title=Zinah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L.

According to the Islamic concept of ''Li'an'', the testimony of a man who accuses his own wife without any other witnesses may be accepted if he swears by God four times that he is telling the truth with a fifth oath to incur God's condemnation if they be lying. In this case, if his wife counter swears, no punishment will be enforced.&lt;ref name="lian"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi|title=Tafhim al-Qur'an, Surah An Noor (The Light)|url=http://englishtafsir.com/Quran/24/index.html#sdfootnote7sym|website=englishtafsir.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quran 24:6-9, Quote - "And for those who launch a charge against their spouses, and have (in support) no evidence but their own― their solitary evidence (can be received) if they bear witness four times (with an oath) by Allah that they are solemnly telling the truth; And the fifth (oath) (should be) that they solemnly invoke the curse of Allah on themselves if they tell a lie. But it would avert the punishment from the wife, if she bears witness four times (with an oath) by Allah, that (her husband) is telling a lie; And the fifth (oath) should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of Allah on herself if (her accuser) is telling the truth. "&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One of the widely followed Islamic legal commentaries, ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik|Al-Muwatta]]'' by [[Malik ibn Anas]], state that contested pregnancy is sufficient proof of adultery and the woman must be stoned to death.&lt;ref name="osismuhsan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Al-Muwatta {{Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=no|41|1|8|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hanafi
[[Hanafi]] jurists have held that the accused must be a ''muhsan'' at the time of religiously disallowed sex, to be punished by ''Rajm'' (stoning).&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; A ''Muhsan'' is an adult, free, Muslim who has previously enjoyed legitimate sexual relations in matrimony, regardless of whether the marriage still exists.&lt;ref name=osismuhsan&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1587 Muhsan] The Oxford Dictionary of Islam (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, stoning does not apply to someone who was never married in his or her life (only lashing in public is the mandatory punishment in such cases).&lt;ref name=es8&gt;Elyse Semerdjian (2008), "Off the Straight Path": Illicit Sex, Law, and Community in Ottoman Aleppo, Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|978-0815631736}}, pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

For evidence, Hanafi fiqh accepts the following: self-confession, or testimony of four male witnesses (female witness is not acceptable).&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; Hanafi Islamic law literature specifies two types of stoning.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; One, when the punishment is based on ''bayyina'', or concrete evidence (four male witnesses). In this case the person is bound, a pit dug, the bound person placed and partially buried inside the pit so that he or she may not escape, thereafter the public stoning punishment is executed.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; A woman sentenced to stoning must be partially buried up to her chest.&lt;ref name=es8b/&gt; The first stones are thrown by the witnesses and the accuser, thereafter the Muslim community present, stated [[Abū Ḥanīfa]] and other Hanafi scholars.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; In second type of stoning, when the punishment is based on self-confession, the stoning is to be performed without digging a pit or partially burying the person. In this case, the [[qadi]] (judge) should throw the first stone before other Muslims join in. Further, if the person flees, the person is allowed to leave.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt;

Hanafi scholars specify the stone size to be used for ''Rajm'', to be the size of one's hand. It should not be too large to cause death too quickly, nor too small to extend only pain.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt;

[[Hanafi]]s have traditionally held that the witnesses should throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by witnesses, and the ''qadi'' must throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by a confession.&lt;ref name=rp&gt;Rudolph Peters, Crime and Punishment in Islamic Law, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521796705}}, pp. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

;Shafi'i
The [[Shafii]] school literature has the same Islamic law analysis as the Hanafi. However, it recommends, that the first stone be thrown by the Imam or his deputy in all cases, followed by the Muslim community witnessing the stoning punishment.&lt;ref name=es8b&gt;Elyse Semerdjian (2008), "Off the Straight Path": Illicit Sex, Law, and Community in Ottoman Aleppo, Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|978-0815631736}}, pp. 23-25&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hanbali
[[Hanbali]] jurist [[Ibn Qudamah]] states, "Muslim jurists are unanimous on the fact that stoning to death is a specified punishment for the married adulterer and adulteress. The punishment is recorded in number of traditions and the practice of Muhammad stands as an authentic source supporting it. This is the view held by all Companions, Successors and other Muslim scholars with the exception of [[Kharijite]]s."&lt;ref name="IslamOnline.net"&gt;{{cite web | author = IslamOnline.net | title = Stoning: Does It Have Any Basis in Shari`ah? | url = http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545902 | accessdate = 2010-07-25 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100616223242/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545902 | archivedate = 2010-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Maliki
[[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) holds that stoning is the required punishment for illegal sex by a married or widowed person, as well as for any form of homosexual relations among men.&lt;ref name=nisrine/&gt; [[Malik ibn Anas]], founded of Maliki fiqh, considered pregnancy in an unmarried woman as a conclusive proof of [[zina]]. He also stated that contested pregnancy is also sufficient proof of adultery and any Muslim woman who is pregnant by a man who she is not married to, at the time of getting pregnant, must be stoned to death.&lt;ref name="osismuhsan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Later Maliki Muslim scholars admitted the concept of "sleeping embryo", where a divorced woman could escape the stoning punishment, if she remained unmarried and became pregnant anytime within five years of her divorce, and it was assumed that she was impregnated by her previous husband but the embryo remained dormant for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McGarvey | first=Kathleen | title=Muslim and Christian women in dialogue : the case of northern Nigeria | publisher=Peter Lang | location=Oxford New York | year=2009 | isbn=978-3-03911-417-7 | pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afghan legal system depended highly on an individual community's local culture and the political or religious ideology of its leaders. Stoning also occurred in lawless areas, where vigilantes committed the act for political purposes. Once the Taliban took over, it became a form of punishment for certain serious crimes or [[adultery]]. After the fall of the Taliban government, the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] re-enforced the 1976 penal code which made no provision for the use of stoning as a punishment.

He questioned Western enmity against Iran, and termed the campaign to remove ''[[rajm]]'' as noise against the implementation of Islamic law in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rc.majlis.ir/fa/news/show/831790 «سنگسار» در شرع حذف شدنی نیست] Persian document; Translation - "Muhammad Ali Asfnany spokesman for the Judicial Committee of the Parliament said Rajm is not being listed in the legislation, but the punishment per the law will be practically the same as the rest of the rules are valid in Islamic law.

The most known case in Iran was the stoning of [[Soraya Manutchehri]] in 1986.

;Methods

In the 2008 version of the [[Hudud|Islamic Penal Code]] of Iran detailed how stoning punishments are to be carried out for adultery, and even hints in some contexts that the punishment may allow for its victims to avoid death:&lt;ref name=AmnestyEndExecutions&gt;Amnesty International (2008), [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/MDE13/001/2008/en/ Iran - End executions by Stoning]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 102 – An adulterous man shall be buried in a ditch up to near his waist and an adulterous woman up to near her chest and then stoned to death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 103 – In case the person sentenced to stoning escapes the ditch in which they are buried, then if the adultery is proven by testimony then they will be returned for the punishment but if it is proven by their own confession then they will not be returned.&lt;ref name=AmnestyEndExecutions /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 104 – The size of the stone used in stoning shall not be too large to kill the convict by one or two throws and at the same time shall not be too small to be called a stone.&lt;ref name=AmnestyEndExecutions /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Depending upon the details of the case, the stoning may be initiated by the judge overseeing the matter or by one of the original witnesses to the adultery.&lt;ref name=AmnestyEndExecutions /&gt; Certain religious procedures may also need to be followed both before and after the implementation of a stoning execution, such as wrapping the person being stoned in traditional burial dress before the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/11/20/graphic-anatomy-of-a-stoning/|title=Anatomy of a stoning – How the law is applied in Iran - National Post|author=Richard Johnson|date=20 November 2010|work=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

As part of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization]] measures, stoning to death (''[[rajm]]'') at a public place  was introduced into law via the 1979 [[Hudood Ordinances]] as punishment for adultery (''zina'') and rape (''zina-bil-jabr'') when committed by a married person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=Martin|title=Twenty-Five Years of Hudood Ordinances- A Review|journal=Washington and Lee Law Review|date=1 September 2007|volume=64|issue=4|pages=1292, 1296 |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1207&amp;context=wlulr |accessdate=18 November 2014|ref=ML252007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, stoning has never been officially utilized since the law came into effect and all judicial executions occur by hanging.&lt;ref name=GallowPak&gt;{{cite web|title=Slow March to the Gallows: Death Penalty in Pakistan|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/Pakistan464angconjointpdm.pdf|website=/www.fidh.org|publisher=Intl.

A conviction for adultery of Safia Bibi, a 13-year-old blind girl who alleged that she was raped by her employer and his son, was reversed and the conviction was set aside on appeal after bitter public criticism. Another conviction for adultery and sentence of stoning (of Shahida Parveen and Muhammad Sarwar) in early 1988 sparked outrage and led to a retrial and acquittal by the Federal Sharia Court. In this case the trial court took the view that notice of divorce by Shahida's former husband, Khushi Muhammad, should have been given to the Chairman of the local council, as stipulated under Section-7(3) of the ''Muslim Family Laws Ordinance'', 1961. This section states that any man who divorces his wife must register it with the Union Council. Otherwise, the court concluded that the divorce stood invalidated and the couple became liable to conviction under the Adultery ordinance. In 2006, the ordinances providing for stoning in the case of adultery or rape were legislatively demoted from overriding status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the Protection of Women Act, 2006 (Pakistan)|url=http://af.org.pk/PDF/Newsletters/Issue%2024%20apr%20jun%2008.pdf|website=af.org.pk|publisher=Aurat Publication and Information Service Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2015|location=Islamabad|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the insurgents she had stated that she wanted sharia law to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7694397.stm|title = Somali woman executed by stoning|date = 2008-10-27|publisher = ''BBC News'' |accessdate = 2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources state that the victim had been crying, had begged for mercy and had to be forced into the hole before being buried up to her neck in the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7708169.stm | publisher=''BBC News'' | title=Stoning victim 'begged for mercy' | date=2008-11-04 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] later learned that the girl was in fact 13 years old and had been arrested by [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabab]] militia after she had reported being gang-raped by three men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2008/10/somalia-girl-stoned-was-child-13-20081031/|title = Somalia: Girl stoned was a child of 13|date=2008-10-31|publisher = [[Amnesty International]]|accessdate = 2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late American Calvinist and Christian [[Christian Reconstructionism|Reconstructionist]] cleric [[Rousas Rushdoony|Rousas John (R. J.) Rushdoony]], his son Mark and his son-in-law [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], supported the reinstatement of the Mosaic law's penal sanctions. Under such a system, the list of civil crimes which carried a death sentence by stoning would include [[homosexuality]], [[adultery]], [[incest]], lying about one's [[virginity]], [[bestiality]], [[witchcraft]], [[idolatry]] or [[apostasy]], public [[blasphemy]], false prophesying, [[kidnapping]], [[rape]], and bearing false witness in a capital case.&lt;ref name="Durand"&gt;{{cite web|last=Durand|first=Greg Loren|url=http://crownrights.com/store/reconstruction_six.php|title=Judicial Warfare: Christian Reconstruction and Its Blueprints for Dominion|chapter=The Object and Cause of True Santification|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131020131146/http://www.crownrights.com/store/reconstruction_six.php/|archivedate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/1998/11/01/invitation-to-a-stoning Invitation to a Stoning], [[Reason (magazine)|Reason.com]], Walter Olson, November 1998.

====Among Muslims====
A survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] in 2013 found varying support in the global Muslim population for stoning as a punishment for adultery (sex between people where at least one person is married; when both participants are unmarried they get 100 lashes). Highest support for stoning is found in Muslims of the Middle East-North Africa region and South-Asian countries while generally less support is found in Muslims living in the Mediterranean and Central Asian countries. Support is consistently higher  in Muslims who want [[Sharia]] to be the law of the land than in Muslims who do not want Sharia.&lt;ref name=Pewsharia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/|title=Muslim Beliefs About Sharia - Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|date=30 April 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for stoning in various countries is as follows:

===Opposition===
Stoning has been condemned by several human rights organizations. Some groups, such as [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name = "amnstoning"&gt;{{Cite news|first=|last=|pages=|title = Amina Lawal|year=2003|publisher=Amnesty International|url = http://www.amnesty-1312.de/Main/AminaLawal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Human Rights Watch]], oppose all capital punishment, including stoning. Other groups, such as RAWA ([[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]]), or the International Committee against Stoning (ICAS), oppose stoning ''per se'' as an especially cruel practice.

Specific sentences of stoning, such as the [[Amina Lawal]] case, have often generated international protest. Groups such as Human Rights Watch,&lt;ref name="hrwstoning"&gt;{{Cite news|first=|last=|pages=|title = Nigeria: Debunking Misconceptions on Stoning Case|year = 2003|publisher = Human Rights Watch|url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/10/26/nigeria-debunking-misconceptions-stoning-case}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in sympathy with these protests, have raised a concern that the Western focus on stoning as an especially "exotic" or "barbaric" act distracts from what they view as the larger problems of capital punishment. They argue that the "more fundamental human rights issue in Nigeria is the dysfunctional justice system."

In Iran, the [[Stop Stoning Forever Campaign]] was formed by various women's rights activists after a man and a woman were stoned to death in [[Mashhad]] in May 2006. The campaign's main goal is to legally abolish stoning as a form of punishment for adultery in Iran.&lt;ref name=meydaan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stop-killing.org/files/Terman_stoning.pdf |author=Rochelle Terman |title=The Stop Stoning Forever Campaign: A Report |format=pdf |date=November 2007 |accessdate=2010-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128142135/http://stop-killing.org/files/Terman_stoning.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights==
Stoning is condemned by human rights groups as a form of [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and [[torture]], and a serious violation of human rights.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2013/11/afghanistan-reject-stoning-flogging-amputation-and-other-taliban-era-punishments/|title=Amnesty International - Afghanistan: Reject stoning, flogging, amputation and other Taliban-era punishments|date=26 November 2013|work=amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/05/31/sudan-ban-death-stoning|title=Sudan: Ban Death by Stoning - Human Rights Watch|work=hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's rights===
Stoning has been condemned as a violation of [[women's rights]] and a form of [[discrimination]] against women. Although stoning is also applied to men, the vast majority of the victims are reported to be women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/publications/legal-commentary/1000000261-gender-inequality-and-discrimination-the-case-of-iranian-women.html#.Ux-4MM503IU|title=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center - Gender Inequality and Discrimination: The Case of Iranian Women|work=iranhrdc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stopstoning.net/IMG/article_PDF/article_20.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313092405/http://www.stopstoning.net/IMG/article_PDF/article_20.pdf |date=March 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2idhp.eu/en/journee-internationale-de-la-femme-2012|title=2012 International Women’s Day «  Institut international des droits de l’homme et de la Paix (2IDHP)|work=2idhp.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the international group Women Living Under Muslim Laws stoning "is one of the most brutal forms of violence perpetrated against women in order to control and punish their sexuality and basic freedoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wluml.org/media/activists-push-global-ban-stoning|title=Activists push for global ban on stoning|work=wluml.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International has argued that the reasons for which women suffer disproportionately from stoning include the fact that women are not treated equally and fairly by the courts; the fact that, being more likely to be [[illiterate]] than men, women are more likely to sign confessions to crimes which they did not commit; and the fact that general discrimination against women in other life aspects leaves them at higher risk of convictions for adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|title=Amnesty International - Iran: Death by stoning, a grotesque and unacceptable penalty|date=15 January 2008|work=amnesty.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020184028/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|archive-date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT rights===
Stoning also targets homosexuals and others who have same-sex relations in certain jurisdictions. In Mauritania,&lt;ref name=ebtrf /&gt; northern Nigeria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6940061.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gay Nigerians face Sharia death | date=10 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia&lt;ref name=ebtrf /&gt; and Yemen,&lt;ref name=ebtrf /&gt; the legal punishment for [[sodomy]] is death by stoning.

===Right to private life===
Human rights organizations argue that many acts targeted by stoning should not be illegal in the first place, as outlawing them interferes with people's right to a private life. Amnesty International said that stoning deals with "acts which should never be criminalized in the first place, including consensual sexual relations between adults, and choosing one’s religion".&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21996">In [[mathematics]], the '''tensor algebra''' of a [[vector space]] ''V'', denoted ''T''(''V'') or ''T''{{i sup|•}}(''V''), is the [[algebra over a field|algebra]] of [[tensor]]s on ''V'' (of any rank) with multiplication being the [[tensor product]]. It is the [[free algebra]] on ''V'', in the sense of being [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from algebras to vector spaces: it is the "most general" algebra containing ''V'', in the sense of the corresponding [[universal property]] (see [[#Adjunction and universal property|below]]).

The tensor algebra is important because many other algebras arise as [[quotient algebra]]s of ''T''(''V'').  These include the [[exterior algebra]], the [[symmetric algebra]], [[Clifford algebra]]s, the [[Weyl algebra]] and [[universal enveloping algebra]]s.

The tensor algebra also has two [[coalgebra]] structures; one simple one, which does not make it a bialgebra, but does lead to the concept of a [[cofree coalgebra]], and a more complicated one, which yields a [[bialgebra]], and can be extended by giving an antipode to create a [[Hopf algebra]] structure.

''Note'': In this article, all algebras are assumed to be [[unital algebra|unital]] and [[associative algebra|associative]]. The unit is explicitly required to define the coproduct.

==Construction==
Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K''. For any nonnegative [[integer]] ''k'', we define the '''''k''th tensor power''' of ''V'' to be the [[tensor product]] of ''V'' with itself ''k'' times:
:&lt;math&gt;T^kV = V^{\otimes k} = V\otimes V \otimes \cdots \otimes V.&lt;/math&gt;
That is, ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' consists of all tensors on ''V'' of [[tensor order|order]] ''k''. By convention ''T''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' is the [[ground field]] ''K'' (as a one-dimensional vector space over itself).

We then construct ''T''(''V'') as the [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum]] of ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' for ''k'' = 0,1,2,…
:&lt;math&gt;T(V)= \bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty T^kV = K\oplus V \oplus (V\otimes V) \oplus (V\otimes V\otimes V) \oplus \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
The multiplication in ''T''(''V'') is determined by the canonical isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;T^kV \otimes T^\ell V \to T^{k + \ell}V&lt;/math&gt;
given by the tensor product, which is then extended by linearity to all of ''T''(''V''). This multiplication rule implies that the tensor algebra ''T''(''V'') is naturally a [[graded algebra]] with ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' serving as the grade-''k'' subspace. This grading can be extended to a '''Z''' grading by appending subspaces &lt;math&gt;T^{k}V=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; for negative integers ''k''.

The construction generalizes in straightforward manner to the tensor algebra of any [[module (mathematics)|module]] ''M'' over a [[commutative ring|''commutative'' ring]]. If ''R'' is a [[non-commutative ring]], one can still perform the construction for any ''R''-''R'' [[bimodule]] ''M''. (It does not work for ordinary ''R''-modules because the iterated tensor products cannot be formed.)

==Adjunction and universal property==
The tensor algebra ''T''(''V'') is also called the '''[[free algebra]]''' on the vector space ''V'', and is functorial. As with other [[free object|free constructions]], the functor ''T'' is [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] to some [[forgetful functor]]. In this case, it's the functor which sends each ''K''-algebra to its underlying vector space.

Explicitly, the tensor algebra satisfies the following [[universal property]], which formally expresses the statement that it is the most general algebra containing ''V'':
: Any [[linear transformation]] ''f'' : ''V'' &amp;rarr; ''A'' from ''V'' to an algebra ''A'' over ''K'' can be uniquely extended to an [[algebra homomorphism]] from ''T''(''V'') to ''A'' as indicated by the following [[commutative diagram]]:

[[Image:TensorAlgebra-01.png|center|Universal property of the tensor algebra]]

Here ''i'' is the [[Inclusion map|canonical inclusion]] of ''V'' into ''T''(''V'') (the unit of the adjunction). One can, in fact, define the tensor algebra ''T''(''V'') as the unique algebra satisfying this property (specifically, it is unique [[up to]] a unique isomorphism), but one must still prove that an object satisfying this property exists.

The above universal property shows that the construction of the tensor algebra is ''functorial'' in nature. That is, ''T'' is a [[functor]] from '''''K''-Vect''', the [[category of vector spaces]] over ''K'', to '''''K''-Alg''', the category of ''K''-algebras. The functoriality of ''T'' means that any linear map from ''V'' to ''W'' extends uniquely to an algebra homomorphism from ''T''(''V'') to ''T''(''W'').

==Non-commutative polynomials==
If ''V'' has finite dimension ''n'', another way of looking at the tensor algebra is as the "algebra of polynomials over ''K'' in ''n'' non-commuting variables". If we take [[basis vector]]s for ''V'', those become non-commuting variables (or [[Indeterminate (variable)|''indeterminates'']]) in ''T''(''V''), subject to no constraints beyond [[associativity]], the [[distributive law]] and ''K''-linearity.

Note that the algebra of polynomials on ''V'' is not &lt;math&gt;T(V)&lt;/math&gt;, but rather &lt;math&gt;T(V^*)&lt;/math&gt;: a (homogeneous) linear function on ''V'' is an element of &lt;math&gt;V^*,&lt;/math&gt; for example coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^1,\dots,x^n&lt;/math&gt; on a vector space are covectors, as they take in a vector and give out a scalar (the given coordinate of the vector).

==Quotients==

Because of the generality of the tensor algebra, many other algebras of interest can be constructed by starting with the tensor algebra and then imposing certain relations on the generators, i.e. by constructing certain [[quotient algebra]]s of ''T''(''V'').  Examples of this are the [[exterior algebra]], the [[symmetric algebra]], [[Clifford algebra]]s, the [[Weyl algebra]] and [[universal enveloping algebra]]s.

==Coalgebra==
The tensor algebra has two different [[coalgebra]] structures. One is compatible with the tensor product, and thus can be extended to a [[bialgebra]], and can be further be extended with an antipode to a [[Hopf algebra]] structure. The other structure, although simpler, cannot be extended to a bialgebra. The first structure is developed immediately below; the second structure is given in the section on the [[cofree coalgebra]], further down.

The development provided below can be equally well applied to the [[exterior algebra]], using the wedge symbol &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; in place of the tensor symbol &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;; a sign must also be kept track of, when permuting elements of the exterior algebra. This correspondence also lasts through the definition of the bialgebra, and on to the definition of a Hopf algebra. That is, the exterior algebra can also be given a Hopf algebra structure.

Similarly, the [[symmetric algebra]] can also be given the structure of a Hopf algebra, in exactly the same fashion, by replacing everywhere the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; by the symmetrized tensor product &lt;math&gt;\otimes_\mathrm{Sym}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. that product where &lt;math&gt;v\otimes_\mathrm{Sym} w = w\otimes_\mathrm{Sym} v.&lt;/math&gt;

In each case, this is possible because the alternating product &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; and the symmetric product &lt;math&gt;\otimes_\mathrm{Sym}&lt;/math&gt; obey the required consistency conditions for the definition of a bialgebra and Hopf algebra; this can be explicitly checked in the manner below. Whenever one has a product obeying these consistency conditions, the construction goes thorough; insofar as such a product gave rise to a quotient space, the quotient space inherits the Hopf algebra structure.

In the language of [[category theory]], one says that there is a [[functor]] {{math|''T''}} from the category of {{math|''K''}}-vector spaces to the category of {{math|''K''}}-associate algebras. But there is also a functor {{math|''Λ''}} taking vector spaces to the category of exterior algebras, and a functor {{math|''Sym''}} taking vector spaces to symmetric algebras. There is a [[natural transformation|natural map]] from {{math|''T''}} to each of these. Verifying that quotienting preserves the Hopf algebra structure is the same as verifying that the maps are indeed natural.

=== Coproduct ===
The coalgebra is obtained by defining a [[coproduct]] or diagonal operator

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta: TV\to TV\boxtimes TV&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;TV&lt;/math&gt; is used as a short-hand for &lt;math&gt;T(V)&lt;/math&gt; to avoid an explosion of parenthesis. The &lt;math&gt;\boxtimes&lt;/math&gt; symbol is used to denote the "external" tensor product, needed for the definition of a coalgebra.  It is being used to distinguish it from the "internal" tensor product &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;, which is already "taken" and being used to denote multiplication in the tensor algebra (see the section ''Multiplication'', below, for further clarification on this issue). In order to avoid confusion between these two symbols, most texts will replace &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; by a plain dot, or even drop it altogether, with the understanding that it is implied from context. This then allows the otimes symbol to be used in place of the boxtimes symbol. This is not done below, and the two symbols are used independently and explicitly, so as to show the proper location of each.  The result is a bit more verbose, but should be easier to comprehend.

The definition of the operator &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is most easily built up in stages, first by defining it for elements &lt;math&gt;v\in V\subset TV&lt;/math&gt; and then by homomorphically extending it to the whole algebra.  A suitable choice for the coproduct is then

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta: v \mapsto v\boxtimes 1 + 1\boxtimes v&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta: 1 \mapsto 1 \boxtimes 1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;1\in K=T^0V\subset TV&lt;/math&gt; is the unit of the field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. By linearity, one obviously has
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(k)=k(1\boxtimes 1)=k\boxtimes 1=1\boxtimes k&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;k\in K.&lt;/math&gt; It is straight-forward to verify that this definition satisfies the axioms of a coalgebra: that is, that
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{id}_{TV} \boxtimes \Delta) \circ \Delta = (\Delta \boxtimes \mathrm{id}_{TV}) \circ \Delta&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{id}_{TV}: x\mapsto x&lt;/math&gt; is the identity map on &lt;math&gt;TV&lt;/math&gt;.  Indeed, one gets
:&lt;math&gt;
((\mathrm{id}_{TV} \boxtimes \Delta) \circ \Delta)(v) =
v\boxtimes 1 \boxtimes 1 + 1\boxtimes v \boxtimes 1 + 1 \boxtimes 1 \boxtimes v
&lt;/math&gt;
and likewise for the other side. At this point, one could invoke a lemma, and say that &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; extends trivially, by linearity, to all of &lt;math&gt;TV&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;TV&lt;/math&gt; is a [[free object]] and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a [[generator (mathematics)|generator]] of the free algebra, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism. However, it is insightful to provide explicit expressions. So, for &lt;math&gt;v\otimes w \in T^2V&lt;/math&gt;, one has (by definition) the homomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta: v\otimes w \mapsto \Delta(v)\otimes \Delta(w)&lt;/math&gt;
Expanding, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \Delta (v\otimes w) &amp;= (v\boxtimes 1 + 1\boxtimes v) \otimes (w\boxtimes 1 + 1\boxtimes w) \\
&amp;= (v\otimes w) \boxtimes 1 + v\boxtimes w +  w\boxtimes v + 1 \boxtimes (v\otimes w) \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above expansion, there is no need to ever write &lt;math&gt;1\otimes v&lt;/math&gt; as this is just plain-old scalar multiplication in the algebra; that is, one trivially has that &lt;math&gt;1\otimes v = 1\cdot v = v.&lt;/math&gt;

The extension above preserves the algebra grading. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta: T^2V \to \bigoplus_{k=0}^2 T^kV \boxtimes T^{(2-k)}V&lt;/math&gt;

Continuing in this fashion, one can obtain an explicit expression for the coproduct acting on a homogenous element of order ''m'':
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta(v_1\otimes\cdots\otimes v_m) &amp;=
\Delta(v_1)\otimes\cdots\otimes\Delta(v_m) \\
&amp;= \sum_{p=0}^m \left(v_0\otimes \cdots \otimes v_p\right) \;\omega
\; \left(v_{p+1}\otimes \cdots \otimes v_m\right) \\ 
&amp;= \sum_{p=0}^m \; \sum_{\sigma\in\mathrm{Sh}(p,m-p+1)} \;
\left(v_{\sigma(0)}\otimes\dots\otimes v_{\sigma(p)}\right) \boxtimes 
\left(v_{\sigma(p+1)}\otimes\dots\otimes v_{\sigma(m)}\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; symbol, which should appear as ш, the sha, denotes the [[shuffle product]]. This is expressed in the second summation, which is taken over all [[(p,q) shuffle|(p,m-p+1)-shuffles]].  The above is written with a notational trick, to keep track of the field element 1: the trick is to write &lt;math&gt;v_0=1&lt;/math&gt;, and this is shuffled into various locations during the expansion of the sum over shuffles.  The shuffle follows directly from the first axiom of a co-algebra: the relative order of the elements &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt; is ''preserved'' in the riffle shuffle: the riffle shuffle merely splits the ordered sequence into two ordered sequences, one on the left, and one on the right. Any one given shuffle obeys
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(0)&lt; \cdots &lt; \sigma(p)\quad\mbox{ and }\quad \sigma(p+1) &lt; \cdots &lt; \sigma(m)&lt;/math&gt;

As before, the algebra grading is preserved:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta: T^mV \to \bigoplus_{k=0}^m T^kV \boxtimes T^{(m-k)}V&lt;/math&gt;

===Counit===
The counit &lt;math&gt;\epsilon : TV \to K&lt;/math&gt; is given by the projection of the field component out from the algebra. This can be written as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon: v\mapsto 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon: k\mapsto k &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k\in K=T^0V&lt;/math&gt;.  By homomorphism under the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;, this extends to 
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon: x\mapsto 0 &lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x\in T^1V \oplus T^2V\oplus \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
It is a straight-forward matter to verify that this counit satisfies the needed axiom for the coalgebra:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{id} \boxtimes \epsilon) \circ \Delta = \mathrm{id} = (\epsilon \boxtimes \mathrm{id}) \circ \Delta.&lt;/math&gt;
Working this explicitly, one has
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
((\mathrm{id} \boxtimes \epsilon) \circ \Delta)(x)
&amp;=(\mathrm{id} \boxtimes \epsilon)(1\boxtimes x + x \boxtimes 1) \\
&amp;=1\boxtimes  \epsilon(x) + x \boxtimes  \epsilon(1) \\
&amp;=0 + x \boxtimes 1 \\
&amp;\cong x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where, for the last step, one has made use of the isomorphism &lt;math&gt;TV\boxtimes K \cong TV&lt;/math&gt;, as is appropriate for the defining axiom of the counit.

== Bialgebra==
A [[bialgebra]] defines both multiplication, and comultiplication, and requires them to be compatible.

=== Multiplication ===
Multiplication is given by an operator
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla: TV\boxtimes TV\to TV&lt;/math&gt;
which, in this case, was already given as the "internal" tensor product. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla: x\boxtimes y\mapsto x \otimes y&lt;/math&gt;
That is, &lt;math&gt;\nabla(x\boxtimes y) = x \otimes y.&lt;/math&gt; The above should make it clear why the &lt;math&gt;\boxtimes&lt;/math&gt; symbol needs to be used: the &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; was actually one and the same thing as &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;; and notational sloppiness here would lead to utter chaos.  To strengthen this: the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; of the tensor algebra corresponds to the multiplication &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; used in the definition of an algebra, whereas the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\boxtimes&lt;/math&gt; is the one required in the definition of comultiplication in a coalgebra.  These two tensor products are ''not'' the same thing!

=== Unit ===
The unit for the algebra
:&lt;math&gt;\eta: K\to TV&lt;/math&gt;
is just the embedding, so that
:&lt;math&gt;\eta: k\mapsto k&lt;/math&gt;
That the unit is compatible with the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; is "trivial": it is just part of the standard definition of the tensor product of vector spaces.  That is, &lt;math&gt;k\otimes x = kx&lt;/math&gt; for field element ''k'' and any &lt;math&gt;x\in TV.&lt;/math&gt;  More verbosely, the axioms for an [[associative algebra]] require the two homomorphisms (or commuting diagrams):
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\circ(\eta \boxtimes\mathrm{id}_{TV}) = \eta\otimes \mathrm{id}_{TV} = \eta\cdot \mathrm{id}_{TV}&lt;/math&gt;
on &lt;math&gt;K\boxtimes TV&lt;/math&gt;, and that symmetrically, on &lt;math&gt;TV\boxtimes K&lt;/math&gt;, that
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\circ(\mathrm{id}_{TV}\boxtimes\eta) = \mathrm{id}_{TV}\otimes\eta = \mathrm{id}_{TV}\cdot\eta&lt;/math&gt;
where the right-hand side of these equations should be understood as the scalar product.

=== Compatibility ===
The unit and counit, and multiplication and comultiplication, all have to satisfy compatibility conditions. It is straightforward to see that 
:&lt;math&gt;\eta \circ \epsilon = \mathrm{id}_K.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the unit is compatible with comultiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \circ \eta = \eta \boxtimes \eta \cong \eta&lt;/math&gt;
The above requires the use of the isomorphism &lt;math&gt;K\boxtimes K \cong K&lt;/math&gt; in order to work; without this, one loses linearity. Component-wise,
:&lt;math&gt;(\Delta \circ \eta)(k) = \Delta(k) = k(1 \boxtimes 1) \cong k \boxtimes k&lt;/math&gt;
with the right-hand side making use of the isomorphism.

Multiplication and the counit are compatible:
:&lt;math&gt;(\epsilon \circ \nabla)(x\boxtimes y) = \epsilon(x\otimes y) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
whenever ''x'' or ''y'' are not elements of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, and otherwise, one has scalar multiplication on the field: &lt;math&gt;k_1\otimes k_2=k_1 k_2.&lt;/math&gt;  The most difficult to verify is the compatibility of multiplication and comultiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \circ\nabla = (\nabla \boxtimes \nabla) 
\circ (\mathrm{id} \boxtimes \tau \boxtimes \mathrm{id}) 
\circ (\Delta \boxtimes \Delta)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tau(x\boxtimes y)= y \boxtimes x&lt;/math&gt; exchanges elements. The compatibility condition only needs to be verified on &lt;math&gt;V\subset TV&lt;/math&gt;; the full compatibility follows as a homomorphic extension to all of &lt;math&gt;TV.&lt;/math&gt; The verification is verbose but straight-forward; it is not given here, except for the final result:
:&lt;math&gt;(\Delta \circ\nabla)(v\boxtimes w) = \Delta(v\otimes w)&lt;/math&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;v,w\in V,&lt;/math&gt; an explicit expression for this was given in the coalgebra section, above.

==Hopf algebra==
The [[Hopf algebra]] adds an antipode to the bialgebra axioms.  The antipode &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;k\in K=T^0V&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;S(k)=1&lt;/math&gt;
This is sometimes called the "anti-identity". The antipode on &lt;math&gt;v\in V=T^1V&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;S(v)=-v&lt;/math&gt;
and on &lt;math&gt;v \otimes w\in T^2V&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;S(v \otimes w) = S(w) \otimes S(v) = w\otimes v&lt;/math&gt;
This extends homomorphically to
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S(v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_m) 
&amp;= S(v_m) \otimes\cdots\otimes S(v_1) \\
&amp;= (-1)^m v_m \otimes\cdots\otimes v_1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Compatibility ===
Compatibility of the antipode with multiplication and comultiplication requires that
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \circ (S \boxtimes \mathrm{id}) \circ \Delta
= \eta \circ \epsilon
= \nabla \circ (\mathrm{id} \boxtimes S) \circ \Delta&lt;/math&gt;
This is straight-forward to verify componentwise on &lt;math&gt;k\in K&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(\nabla \circ (S \boxtimes \mathrm{id}) \circ \Delta)(k)
&amp;= (\nabla \circ (S \boxtimes \mathrm{id})) (k\boxtimes k) \\
&amp;= \nabla(1 \boxtimes k) \\
&amp;= 1 \otimes k \\
&amp;= k
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, on &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(\nabla \circ (S \boxtimes \mathrm{id}) \circ \Delta)(v)
&amp;= (\nabla \circ (S \boxtimes \mathrm{id})) (v\boxtimes 1 + 1 \boxtimes v) \\
&amp;= \nabla(-v \boxtimes 1 + 1 \boxtimes v) \\
&amp;= -v \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes v \\
&amp;= -v + v\\
&amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Recall that
:&lt;math&gt;(\eta \circ \epsilon)(k)=\eta(k)=k&lt;/math&gt;
and that 
:&lt;math&gt;(\eta \circ \epsilon)(x)=\eta(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;
for any &lt;math&gt;x\in TV&lt;/math&gt; that is ''not'' in &lt;math&gt;K.&lt;/math&gt;

One may proceed in a similar manner, by homomorphism, verifying that the antipode inserts the appropriate cancellative signs in the shuffle, starting with the compatibility condition on &lt;math&gt;T^2V&lt;/math&gt; and proceeding by induction.

==Cofree coalgebra==
{{main article|Cofree coalgebra}}
One may define a different coproduct on the tensor algebra, simpler than the one given above.  It is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(v_1 \otimes \dots \otimes v_k) := \sum_{j=0}^{k} (v_0 \otimes \dots \otimes v_j) \boxtimes (v_{j+1} \otimes \dots \otimes v_{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;

Here, as before, one uses the notational trick &lt;math&gt;v_0=v_{k+1}=1\in K&lt;/math&gt; (recalling that &lt;math&gt;v\otimes 1=v&lt;/math&gt; trivially).

This coproduct gives rise to a coalgebra. It describes a coalgebra that is [[duality (linear algebra)|dual]] to the algebra structure on ''T''(''V''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''V''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the [[dual vector space]] of linear maps ''V'' → '''F'''. In the same way that the tensor algebra is a [[free algebra]], the corresponding coalgebra is termed (conilpotent) co-free.  With the usual product this is not a bialgebra. It ''can'' be turned into a bialgebra with the product &lt;math&gt;v_i\cdot v_j=(i,j)v_{i+j}&lt;/math&gt; where ''(i,j)'' denotes the binomial coefficient for &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{i+j}{i}&lt;/math&gt;. This bialgebra is known as the [[divided power structure|divided power Hopf algebra]].

The difference between this, and the other coalgebra is most easily seen in the &lt;math&gt;T^2V&lt;/math&gt; term.  Here, one has that
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(v\otimes w) = 1\boxtimes (v\otimes w) + v \boxtimes w + (v\otimes w) \boxtimes 1&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;v,w\in V&lt;/math&gt;, which is clearly missing a shuffled term, as compared to before.

In [[multilinear algebra]], a '''tensor contraction''' is an operation on a [[tensor]] that arises from the [[natural pairing]] of a finite-[[dimension]]al [[vector space]] and its [[dual vector space|dual]]. In components, it is expressed as a sum of products of scalar components of the tensor(s) caused by applying the [[summation convention]] to a pair of dummy indices that are bound to each other in an expression.  The contraction of a single [[mixed tensor]] occurs when a pair of literal indices (one a subscript, the other a superscript) of the tensor are set equal to each other and summed over. In the [[Einstein notation]] this summation is built into the notation. The result is another [[tensor]] with order reduced by 2.

Tensor contraction can be seen as a generalization of the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]].

== Abstract formulation ==
Let ''V'' be a vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k''. The core of the contraction operation, and the simplest case, is the [[natural transformation|natural]] pairing of ''V'' with its dual vector space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;. The pairing is the [[linear transformation]] from the [[Component-free treatment of tensors#Definition: Tensor Product of Vector Spaces|tensor product]] of these two spaces to the field ''k'':

: &lt;math&gt; C : V^* \otimes V \rightarrow k &lt;/math&gt;

corresponding to the [[bilinear form]]

: &lt;math&gt; \langle f, v \rangle = f(v) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; and ''v'' is in ''V''. The map ''C'' defines the contraction operation on a tensor of type {{nowrap|(1, 1)}}, which is an element of &lt;math&gt;V^* \otimes V &lt;/math&gt;. Note that the result is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] (an element of ''k''). Using the natural isomorphism between &lt;math&gt;V^* \otimes V &lt;/math&gt; and the space of linear transformations from ''V'' to ''V'',&lt;ref name="natural iso"&gt;Let {{nowrap|L(''V'', ''V'')}} be the space of linear transformations from ''V'' to ''V''. Then the natural map

: &lt;math&gt;V^* \otimes V \rightarrow L(V,V) &lt;/math&gt;

is defined by

: &lt;math&gt;f \otimes v \mapsto g ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{nowrap|1=''g''(''w'') = ''f''(''w'')''v''}}. Suppose that ''V'' is finite-dimensional. If {''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a basis of ''V'' and {''f''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;} is the corresponding dual basis, then &lt;math&gt;f^i \otimes v_j&lt;/math&gt; maps to the transformation whose matrix in this basis has only one nonzero entry, a 1 in the ''i'',''j'' position. This shows that the map is an isomorphism.&lt;/ref&gt; one obtains a basis-free definition of the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]].

In general, a [[tensor]] of type {{nowrap|(''m'', ''n'')}} (with {{nowrap|''m'' ≥ 1}} and {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 1}}) is an element of the vector space

: &lt;math&gt;V \otimes \cdots \otimes V \otimes V^{*} \otimes \cdots \otimes V^{*}&lt;/math&gt;

(where there are ''m'' factors ''V'' and ''n'' factors ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="fulton_harris"&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Fulton |authorlink=William Fulton (mathematician) |first2=Joe |last2=Harris |authorlink2=Joe Harris (mathematician) |title=Representation Theory: A First Course |series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics|GTM]] |volume=129 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn=0-387-97495-4 |pages=471–476 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="warner"&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Warner |title=Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups |series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics|GTM]] |volume=94 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=1993 |isbn=0-387-90894-3 |pages=54–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the natural pairing to the ''k''th ''V'' factor and the ''l''th ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; factor, and using the identity on all other factors, defines the (''k'', ''l'') contraction operation, which is a linear map which yields a tensor of type {{nowrap|(''m'' − 1, ''n'' − 1)}}.&lt;ref name="fulton_harris"/&gt; By analogy with the {{nowrap|(1, 1)}} case, the general contraction operation is sometimes called the trace.

== Contraction in index notation ==

In [[tensor index notation]], the basic contraction of a vector and a dual vector is denoted by

: &lt;math&gt; \tilde f (\vec v) = f_\gamma v^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;

which is shorthand for the explicit coordinate summation&lt;ref name="physics"&gt;In physics (and sometimes in mathematics), indices often start with zero instead of one. In four-dimensional spacetime, indices run from 0 to 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; f_\gamma v^\gamma = f_1 v^1 + f_2 v^2 + \cdots + f_n v^n &lt;/math&gt;

(where {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the components of {{math|''v''}} in a particular basis and {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the components of {{math|''f''}} in the corresponding dual basis).

Since a general mixed [[dyadic tensor]] is a linear combination of decomposable tensors of the form &lt;math&gt;f \otimes v&lt;/math&gt;, the explicit formula for the dyadic case follows: let

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = T^i{}_j \mathbf{e}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}^j &lt;/math&gt;

be a mixed dyadic tensor. Then its contraction is

: &lt;math&gt; T^i {}_j \mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{e}^j = T^i {}_j \delta_i {}^j
= T^j{}_j = T^1{}_1 + \cdots + T^n{}_n &lt;/math&gt;.

A general contraction is denoted by labeling one [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] index and one [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] index with the same letter, summation over that index being implied by the [[summation convention]]. The resulting contracted tensor inherits the remaining indices of the original tensor. For example, contracting a tensor ''T'' of type (2,2) on the second and third indices to create a new tensor ''U'' of type (1,1) is written as

: &lt;math&gt; T^{ab} {}_{bc} = \sum_{b}{T^{ab}{}_{bc}} = T^{a1} {}_{1c} + T^{a2} {}_{2c} + \cdots + T^{an} {}_{nc} = U^a {}_c .&lt;/math&gt;

By contrast, let

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \mathbf{e}^i \otimes \mathbf{e}^j &lt;/math&gt;

be an unmixed dyadic tensor. This tensor does not contract; if its base vectors are dotted the result is the contravariant [[metric (mathematics)|metric tensor]],

: &lt;math&gt; g^{ij} = \mathbf{e}^i \cdot \mathbf{e}^j &lt;/math&gt;,

whose rank is 2.

== Metric contraction ==
{{see also|Raising and lowering indices#An example from Minkowski spacetime}}
As in the previous example, contraction on a pair of indices that are either both contravariant or both covariant is not possible in general. However, in the presence of an [[inner product]] (also known as a [[Metric tensor|metric]]) ''g'', such contractions are possible. One uses the metric to raise or lower one of the indices, as needed, and then one uses the usual operation of contraction. The combined operation is known as ''[[metric contraction]]''.&lt;ref name="o'neill"&gt;{{cite book |first=Barrett |last=O'Neill |title=Semi-Riemannian Geometry with Applications to Relativity |location= |publisher=Academic Press |year=1983 |page=86 |isbn=0-12-526740-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application to tensor fields ==

Contraction is often applied to [[tensor fields]] over spaces (e.g. [[Euclidean space]], [[manifold]]s, or [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]{{fact|date=April 2015}}). Since contraction is a purely algebraic operation, it can be applied pointwise to a tensor field, e.g. if ''T'' is a (1,1) tensor field on Euclidean space, then in any coordinates, its contraction (a scalar field) ''U'' at a point ''x'' is given by

: &lt;math&gt;U(x) = \sum_{i} T^{i}_{i}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the role of ''x'' is not complicated here, it is often suppressed, and the notation for tensor fields becomes identical to that for purely algebraic tensors.

Over a [[Riemannian manifold]], a metric (field of inner products) is available, and both metric and non-metric contractions are crucial to the theory. For example, the [[Ricci tensor]] is a non-metric contraction of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]], and the [[scalar curvature]] is the unique metric contraction of the Ricci tensor.

One can also view contraction of a tensor field in the context of modules over an appropriate ring of functions on the manifold&lt;ref name="o'neill"/&gt; or the context of sheaves of modules over the structure sheaf;&lt;ref name="hartshorne"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robin |last=Hartshorne |authorlink=Robin Hartshorne |title=Algebraic Geometry |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=1977 |isbn=0-387-90244-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; see the discussion at the end of this article.

=== Tensor divergence ===

As an application of the contraction of a tensor field, let ''V'' be a [[vector field]] on a [[Riemannian manifold]] (for example, [[Euclidean space]]). Let &lt;math&gt; V^\alpha {}_{;\beta}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[covariant derivative]] of ''V'' (in some choice of coordinates). In the case of [[Cartesian coordinates]] in Euclidean space, one can write

: &lt;math&gt; V^\alpha {}_{;\beta} = {\partial V^\alpha \over \partial x^\beta}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then changing index β to α causes the pair of indices to become bound to each other, so that the derivative contracts with itself to obtain the following sum:

: &lt;math&gt; V^\alpha {}_{;\alpha} = V^0 {}_{;0} + \cdots + V^n {}_{;n} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the [[divergence]] div ''V''. Then

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{div} V = V^\alpha {}_{;\alpha} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

is a [[continuity equation]] for ''V''.

In general, one can define various divergence operations on higher-rank [[tensor fields]], as follows. If ''T'' is a tensor field with at least one contravariant index, taking the [[covariant differential]] and contracting the chosen contravariant index with the new covariant index corresponding to the differential results in a new tensor of rank one lower than that of ''T''.&lt;ref name="o'neill"/&gt;

== Contraction of a pair of tensors ==

One can generalize the core contraction operation (vector with dual vector) in a slightly different way, by considering a pair of tensors ''T'' and ''U''. The [[tensor product]] &lt;math&gt;T \otimes U&lt;/math&gt; is a new tensor, which, if it has at least one covariant and one contravariant index, can be contracted. The case where ''T'' is a vector and ''U'' is a dual vector is exactly the core operation introduced first in this article.

In tensor index notation, to contract two tensors with each other, one places them side by side (juxtaposed) as factors of the same term. This implements the tensor product, yielding a composite tensor. Contracting two indices in this composite tensor implements the desired contraction of the two tensors.

For example, matrices can be represented as tensors of type (1,1) with the first index being contravariant and the second index being covariant.  Let &lt;math&gt; \Lambda^\alpha {}_\beta &lt;/math&gt; be the components of one  matrix and let &lt;math&gt; \Mu^\beta {}_\gamma &lt;/math&gt; be the components of a second matrix.  Then their multiplication is given by the following contraction, an example of the contraction of a pair of tensors:

: &lt;math&gt; \Lambda^\alpha {}_\beta \Mu^\beta {}_\gamma = \Nu^\alpha {}_\gamma &lt;/math&gt;.

Also, the [[interior product]] of a vector with a [[differential form]] is a special case of the contraction of two tensors with each other.

== More general algebraic contexts ==

Let ''R'' be a [[commutative ring]] and let ''M'' be a finite free [[module (mathematics)|module]] over ''R''. Then contraction operates on the full (mixed) tensor algebra of ''M'' in exactly the same way as it does in the case of vector spaces over a field. (The key fact is that the natural pairing is still perfect in this case.)

More generally, let ''O''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; be a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of commutative rings over a [[topological space]] ''X'', e.g. ''O''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; could be the [[structure sheaf]] of a [[complex manifold]], [[analytic space]], or [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]. Let ''M'' be a [[locally free sheaf]] of modules over ''O''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; of finite rank. Then the dual of ''M'' is still well-behaved&lt;ref name="hartshorne"/&gt; and contraction operations make sense in this context.

A '''torture murder''' is a murder where death was preceded by the [[torture]] of the victim. In many legal jurisdictions, a murder involving "exceptional brutality or cruelty" will attract a harsher sentence.

==Frequency==

Notable individual incidents and successfully prosecuted cases are listed below but torture murder is much more common than this list may suggest. [[Lynching in the United States]]—extrajudicial killing by a mob, which often served as a means of racial terrorism—frequently involved public torture of the victim or victims, and was in many instances followed by [[human trophy collecting]], too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tharoor|first=Ishaan |date=September 27, 2016 |title= U.S. owes black people reparations for a history of ‘racial terrorism,’ says U.N. panel|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/27/u-s-owes-black-people-reparations-for-a-history-of-racial-terrorism-says-u-n-panel/|work= [[The Washington Post]]|location= |access-date=May 1, 2017|quote="Lynching was a form of racial terrorism that has contributed to a legacy of racial inequality that the United States must address. Thousands of people of African descent were killed in violent public acts of racial control and domination and the perpetrators were never held accountable." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=[[Equal Justice Initiative]]|title=Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror|year=2017|location=Montgomery, Alabama|url=https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/report/|page=14|edition=3rd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510151602/https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/report/|archive-date=2018-05-10|quote=Public spectacle lynchings were those in which large crowds of white people, often numbering in the thousands, gathered to witness pre-planned, heinous killings that featured prolonged torture, mutilation, dismemberment, and/or burning of the victim. Many were carnival-like events, with vendors selling food, printers producing postcards featuring photographs of the lynching and corpse, and the victim’s body parts collected as souvenirs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, since industrial acid became available in quantity during the 19th century, [[Acid throwing|acid attacks]] have become a globally widespread method of murder.

In the 21st century, many of the [[Killing of captives by ISIL|murders]] of foreigners in and citizens of [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] committed by members of the terrorist organization [[Daesh]] were preceded by torture.  Film footage of the [[persecution of Muslims in Myanmar]] documents the aftermath and testimony of torture murder by government forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Myanmar's Killing Fields |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/myanmars-killing-fields/ |series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] |network=[[PBS]] |date=2018-05-08 |season=36 |transcript=transcript |transcript-url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/myanmars-killing-fields/transcript/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and evidence has demonstrated torture murder associated with many other [[massacre]]s, [[war crime]]s, and [[genocide]]s, both contemporary and historical.

==Punishment==

[[Murder#Country-specific_murder_law|Murder laws worldwide]] vary a great deal, but a murder involving torture will generally attract a harsher penalty than a murder alone. Legal mechanisms of penalty enhancement vary between jurisdictions. In the laws of [[Murder (Italian law)|Italy]], [[Murder in German law|Germany]], [[Murder (Norwegian law)|Norway]], and many parts of the [[Murder (United States law)|United States]], there are two or more "degrees" of murder, with wording such as: "''...inflicting torture upon the victim prior to the victim's death''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAW|Penal Law § 235.20 PEN Part 3 Title H]&lt;/ref&gt; typically used to rule that the highest degree should apply. In other jurisdictions, it may be that even if there was just one crime of murder, the sentencing practices and guidelines are such that the [[Aggravation (law)|aggravating circumstance]] of any torture will nevertheless allow for a harsher than normal penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sentencing - Mandatory life sentences in Murder cases|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_-_mandatory_life_sentences_in_murder_cases/#an08|website=CPS|publisher=Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the offence involved gratuitous cruelty|url=https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/sentencing/section_21a.html|website=Sentencing Bench Book|publisher=Judicial Commission of New South Wales|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7127">'''Triadic closure''' is a concept in [[social network]] theory, first suggested by [[Germany|German]] [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Georg Simmel]] in his 1908 book ''Soziologie'' [''Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation''].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/style/17facebook.html?pagewanted=print Georg Simmel], originator of the concept: "Facebook" article at [[the New York Times]] website. Retrieved on December 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Triadic closure is the property among three nodes A, B, and C, such that if a strong tie exists between A-B and A-C, there is a weak or strong tie between B-C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/complexity/course/emergence06/bookreviews/kmaffei.html Working concept] of triadic closure: book review of [[Duncan Watts]]' "[[Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age]]" at the ''Serendip'' ([[Bryn Mawr College]]) website. Retrieved on December 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This property is too extreme to hold true across very large, complex networks, but it is a useful simplification of reality that can be used to understand and predict networks.&lt;ref name=Easley&gt;Easley, D, &amp; Kleinberg, J. (2010). Networks, crowds, and markets: reasoning about a highly connected world. Cornell, NY: Cambridge Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Triadic closure was made popular by [[Mark Granovetter]] in his 1973 article ''The Strength of Weak Ties''.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, M. (1973). "[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/soc/people/mgranovetter/documents/granstrengthweakties.pdf The Strength of Weak Ties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216103216/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/soc/people/mgranovetter/documents/granstrengthweakties.pdf |date=2008-02-16 }}", American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 78, Issue 6, May 1360-80.&lt;/ref&gt; There he synthesized the theory of [[cognitive balance]] first introduced by [[Fritz Heider]] in 1946 with a Simmelian understanding of social networks. In general terms, cognitive balance refers to the propensity of two individuals to want to feel the same way about an object. If the triad of three individuals is not closed, then the person connected to both of the individuals will want to close this triad in order to achieve closure in the relationship network.

==Measurements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
The two most common measures of triadic closure for a graph are (in no particular order) the [[clustering coefficient]] and transitivity for that graph.

===Clustering coefficient===
One measure for the presence of triadic closure is [[clustering coefficient]], as follows:

Let &lt;math&gt;G = (V,E)&lt;/math&gt; be an undirected simple graph (i.e., a graph having no self-loops or multiple edges) with V the set of vertices and E the set of edges. Also, let &lt;math&gt;N = |V|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M = |E|&lt;/math&gt; denote the number of vertices and edges in G, respectively, and let &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; be the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of vertex i.

Then we can define a triangle among the triple of vertices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to be a set with the following three edges: {(i,j), (j,k), (i,k)}. Then we can define the number of triangles that vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is involved in as &lt;math&gt;\delta (i)&lt;/math&gt; and, as each triangle is counted three times, we can express the number of triangles in G as &lt;math&gt;\delta (G) = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i\in V} \ \delta (i)&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that triadic closure holds, only two strong edges are required for a triple to form and the number of triples of vertex i is &lt;math&gt;\tau (i) = \binom{d_i}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, assuming &lt;math&gt;d_i \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we can express &lt;math&gt;\tau (G) = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i\in V} \ \tau (i)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, for a vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d_i \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[clustering coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;c(i)&lt;/math&gt; of vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of triples for vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; that are closed, and can be measured as &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta (i)}{\tau (i)}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the [[clustering coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;C(G)&lt;/math&gt; of graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;C(G) = \frac {1}{N_2} \sum_{i \in V, d_i \ge 2} c(i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt; is the number of nodes with degree at least 2.

===Transitivity===
Another measure for the presence of triadic closure is transitivity, defined as &lt;math&gt;T(G) = \frac{3\delta (G)}{\tau (G)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Causes and effects==
In a trust network, triadic closure is likely to develop due to the transitive property. If a node A trusts node B, and node B trusts node C, node A will have the basis to trust node C. In a social network, strong triadic closure occurs because there is increased opportunity for nodes A and C with common neighbor B to meet and therefore create at least weak ties. Node B also has the incentive to bring A and C together to decrease the latent stress in two separate relationships.&lt;ref name=Easley/&gt;

Networks that stay true to this principle become highly interconnected and have very high clustering coefficients. However, networks that do not follow this principle turn out to be poorly connected and may suffer from instability once negative relations are included.

Triadic closure is a good model for how networks will evolve over time. While simple graph theory tends to analyze networks at one point in time, applying the triadic closure principle can predict the development of ties within a network and show the progression of connectivity.&lt;ref name=Easley/&gt;

In social networks, triadic closure facilitates cooperative behavior, but when new connections are made via
referrals from existing connections the average global fraction of cooperators is less than when individuals choose new connections randomly from the population at large. Two possible effects for this are by the structural and informational construction. The structural construction arises from the propensity toward high clusterability. The informational construction comes from the assumption that an individual knows something about a friend's friend, as opposed to a random stranger.

==Strong Triadic Closure Property and local bridges==
Strong Triadic Closure Property is that if a node has strong ties to two neighbors, then these neighbors must have at least a weak tie between them. A [[local bridge]] occurs, on the other hand, when a node is acting as a gatekeeper between two neighboring nodes who are not otherwise connected. In a network that follows the Strong Triadic Closure Property, one of the ties between nodes involved in a local bridge needs to be a weak tie.

===Proof by contradiction===

Let node B be a local bridge between nodes A and C such that there is no weak tie between the nodes involved. Therefore, B has a strong tie to both A and C. By the definition of Strong Triadic Closure, a weak tie would develop between nodes A and C. However, this contradicts the fact that B is a local gatekeeper. Thus at least one of the nodes involved in a local bridge needs to be a weak tie to prevent triadic closure from occurring.&lt;ref name=Easley/&gt;

A '''tzompantli''' {{IPA-nah|t͡somˈpant͡ɬi|}} or '''skull rack''' is a type of wooden rack or palisade documented in several [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations, which was used for the public display of [[human skull]]s, typically those of [[Human trophy taking in Mesoamerica|war captives]] or other [[human sacrifice|sacrificial victims]]. It is a scaffold-like construction of poles on which heads and skulls were placed after holes had been made in them.&lt;ref&gt;Palka (2000) pg 152&lt;/ref&gt; Many have been documented throughout Mesoamerica, and range from the Epiclassic (ca. 600–900 CE) through early Post-Classic (ca. 900–1250 CE).&lt;ref name=Mendo397&gt;Mendoza (2007) pg 397&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 archeologists announced the discovery of the Huey Tzompantli, with more than 650 skulls, in the archeological zone of the Templo Mayor in Mexico city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-archaeology-skulls-idUSKBN19M3Q6|title=Tower of human skulls in Mexico casts new light on Aztecs|date=2017-07-03|access-date=2017-07-05|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name comes from the [[Classical Nahuatl]] language of the [[Aztec]]s but is also commonly applied to similar structures depicted in other civilizations. Its precise [[etymology]] is uncertain although its general interpretation is "skull rack," "wall of skulls," or "skull banner."&lt;ref name=Mendo397 /&gt; It's most likely a compound of the Nahuatl words ''tzontecomatl'' ("skull"; from ''tzontli'' or ''tzom-'' "hair", "scalp" and ''tecomatl'' ("[[gourd]]" or "container"), and ''pamitl'' ("banner"). That derivation has been ascribed to explain the depictions in several codices that associate these with banners; however, Nahuatl linguist [[Frances Karttunen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Frances Karttunen | title=Linguist list server | work=etymology of Tzompantli | url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0501a&amp;L=nahuat-l&amp;D=1&amp;P=197 | accessdate=September 25, 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025200407/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0501a&amp;L=nahuat-l&amp;D=1&amp;P=197 | archivedate=October 25, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed that ''pantli'' means merely "row" or "wall."

==Historical distribution==

===General information===
It was most commonly erected as a linearly-arranged series of vertical posts connected by a series of horizontal crossbeams. The skulls were pierced or threaded laterally along these horizontal stakes. An alternate arrangement, more common in the Maya regions, was for the skulls to be impaled on top of one another along the vertical posts.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson et al. (1992) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tzompantli'' are known chiefly from their depiction in Late Postclassic (13th to 16th centuries) and post-Conquest (mid-16th to 17th centuries) [[Maya codices|codices]], contemporary accounts of the [[conquistador]]es, and several other inscriptions. However, a ''tzompantli''-like structure, thought to be the first instance of such structures, has been excavated from the Proto-Classic [[Zapotec civilization]] at the [[La Coyotera]], [[Oaxaca]] site, dated from c. 2nd century BCE to 3rd century [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (1982), pp.236-239&lt;/ref&gt; The Zapotecs called this structure a "''yàgabetoo''," and it displayed 61 skulls.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tzompantli'' are also noted in other Mesoamerican [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] cultures, such as the [[Toltec]] and [[Mixtec]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe (2011) 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza (2007) 396&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toltec===
At the Toltec capital of [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]] exists the first indications in Central Mexico of a real fascination with skulls and skeletons. Tula flourished from the ninth until the thirteenth century. The site includes the decimated remains of a tzompantli. The tzompantli at Tula displayed multiple rows of stone carved skulls adorning the sides of a broad platform upon which the actual skulls of sacrificial victims were exhibited. The tzompantli appeared during the final phases of civilization at Tula, which was destroyed around 1200.&lt;ref&gt;Brandes (2009) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maya===
Other examples are indicated from [[Maya civilization]] sites such as [[Uxmal]] and other [[Puuc]] region sites of the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]], dating from around the late 9th-century decline of the [[Maya Classical Era]]. A particularly fine and intact inscription example survives at the extensive [[Chichen Itza]] site.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993), p.176.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Großes Bild|2014-01-03 Tzompantli in Chichén Itzá anagoria.jpg|1500px|[[Chichén Itzá]] Tzompantli}}

Human sacrifice on a large scale was introduced to the Maya by the Toltecs from the appearances of the tzompantli by the Chichen Itza ball courts. Six ball court reliefs at Chichen Itza depict the decapitation of a ball player; it seems that the losers would be beheaded and would have their skulls placed on the Tzompantli.&lt;ref name=Coe1956&gt;Coe (2011) pg. 195-196 (or 210 in the 2015 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tzompantli Tovar.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|A ''tzompantli'' is illustrated to the right of a depiction of an Aztec temple dedicated to the deity [[Huitzilopochtli]]; from Juan de Tovar's 1587 manuscript, also known as the [[Ramírez Codex]].]]

===Aztec era===
The word ''tzompantli'' is [[Nahuatl]] and was used by the [[Aztec|Aztecs]] to refer to the skull-racks found in many Aztec cities; The first and most prominent example is the Huey Tzompantli (Great Skull-rack) located the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]] and described by the early conquistadors. There were at least five more skull racks in Tenochtitlan but by all accounts they were much smaller. 

According to [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]'s eye-witness account, the ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España]]'', written several decades after the event, after Cortes' expedition was forced to make their initial retreat from Tenochtitlan, the Aztecs erected a makeshift tzompantli to display the severed heads of men and horses they had captured from the invaders. This ''tzompantli'' is depicted in the twelfth book of the Florentine Codex. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/10096/view/1/1/|title=General History of the Things of New Spain by Fray Bernardino de Sahagún: The Florentine Codex — Viewer — World Digital Library|website=www.wdl.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.famsi.org/research/pohl/pohl_meeting.html|title=FAMSI - John Pohl's Mesoamerica - Historical Records of the Conquest|last=famsi|first=|date=|website=www.famsi.org|language=EN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This taunting is also depicted in an Aztec codex which relates the story, and the subsequent battles which led to the eventual capture of the city by the Spanish forces and their allies.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz del Castillo (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the stay of Cortes' expedition in the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]] (initially as guest-captives of the Emperor [[Moctezuma II]], before the battle which would lead to the conquest), they reported a wooden ''tzompantli'' altar adorned with the skulls from recent sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Levy (2009) pg 65&lt;/ref&gt; Within the complex of the [[Templo Mayor]] itself, a relief in [[stucco]] depicted these sacrifices; the remains of this relief have survived and may now be seen in the ruins in the [[Zócalo]] of present-day [[Mexico City]]. 

==== Preparation of ''tzompantli'' ====
Excavations at [[Templo Mayor]] in the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]] have revealed many skulls belonging to women and children, in addition to those of men, a demonstration of the diversity of the [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|human sacrifices in Aztec culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40473547|title=Aztec tower of human skulls uncovered in Mexico City|last1=BBC Staff|date=2 July 2017|work=British Broadcasting Company|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After displaying severed heads, many scholars have determined that limbs of Aztec victims would be [[Cannibalism in pre-Columbian America|cannibalized]] &lt;ref&gt;Michael Harner (1977) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  Fray Diego Durán confirms this, stating that skulls were delivered to temples after "the flesh had been eaten".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Durán, Diego. ''Book of the gods and rites and the ancient calendar''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1971. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

Durán notes that the ''tzompantli'' were periodically renovated. Regarding this, Durán states&lt;blockquote&gt;"When [the skulls] become old and deteriorated, they fell in pieces. When the palisade become old, however, it was renovated, and on its removal many [skulls] broke. Others were removed to make room for more, so that there would be a place for those were to be killed later"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Archeologist Eduardo Contreras believes that the tissue attached to skulls was removed prior to a ''tzompantli'' pole being inserted through the side of the skulls. He bases these assumptions off of excavations of the Plaza de las Tres Culturas at Tlatelolco, Mexico City between 1960 and 1965. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Huey Tzompantli ====
The Huey Tzompantli was the central ''tzompantli'' found in Tenochtitlan. The skull rack here served as a reminder of the Aztec's ongoing [[Flower war|Flowery Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe and Koontz (2008) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect of [[Aztec warfare]] was the capture of enemy warriors to serve as sacrificial victims, which is evident from the number of warriors found sacrificed around Aztec structures.&lt;ref&gt;Coe and Koontz (2008) pg 110&lt;/ref&gt; One conquistador, [[Andrés de Tapia]], was given the task of counting the skulls on the "tzompantli" at Tenochtitlan and estimated that there were 136,000 skulls on it.&lt;ref&gt;Harner (1977) p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; However, based on numbers given by Taipa and Fray [[Diego Durán]], Bernard Ortiz de Montellano&lt;ref&gt;Ortíz de Montellano 1983&lt;/ref&gt; has calculated that there were at most 60,000 skulls on the ''"Hueyi Tzompantli"'' (Great Skullrack) of Tenochtitlan. The "Hueyi Tzompantli" consisted of a massive masonry platform composed of “thirty long steps” measuring fully 60 meters in length by 30 meters wide at its summit. Atop of the aforementioned platform was erected an equally formidable wooden palisade and scaffolding consisting of between 60 and 70 massive uprights or timbers woven together with an impressive constellation of horizontal cross beams upon which were suspended the tens of thousands of decapitated human heads once impaled thereon.&lt;ref&gt;Ruben Mendoza (2007) p. 407-408.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding, this Bernal Díaz de Castillo states &lt;blockquote&gt;"I remember that they had in a plaza, where there were some shrines, so many places of dead skulls, which could be counted, according to the concert as they were set, that when they appeared they would be more than one hundred thousand; and I say again about one hundred thousand. And in another part of the square were as many rowers of bones without meat, bones of dead, that could not be counted; and they had in many beams many heads hanging from one part to another. And  keeping those bones and skulls were three priests, who, as we understood, wherein charge of them.  Of which we had to look more after we entered the land well: in all the villages they were that way, and also in Tascala."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.rae.es/sites/default/files/Aparato_de_variantes_Historia_verdadera_de_la_conquista_de_la_Nueva_Espana.pdf|title=Historia Verdadera de la Conquista de la Nueva España|last=Díaz del Castillo|first=Bernal|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Various scholarly interpretations of the cosmological importance of Huey Tzompantli's placement have emerged.  Matos Monteczum claims that a central ''tzompantli'' was placed north of the Templo Mayor. Monteczuma notes that no corresponding shrine was found south. Monteczuma also notes that Mexica views of the universe, which divide the universe into a horizontal and vertical plane, claim that the northern sector of the horizontal plane corresponds to Mictlampa, or the land of the dead.  &lt;ref&gt;Vol. 53, No. 4, 75th Anniversary Meeting of the American Academy of Religion (Dec., 1985), pp. 797-813&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, Rubén G. Mendoza contends that the Huey Tzompantli was placed on an east-west axis between the Templo Mayor and a principal ball court.  The Huey Tzompantli would have been aligned with the  marker within the Templo Mayor dividing one half for Tlaloc and the other half for Huitzilopochtli. Mendoza argues that as the sun traveled through the sky, it would have ascended into the "vault of the heavens," represented by the Huey Tzompantli. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MENDOZA|first=RUBÉN G.|date=2007|title=The Divine Gourd Tree|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-48303-0_16.pdf|journal=SpringerLink|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-48303-0_16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Historical depictions ====
[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 2r.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of the Codex Mendoza]]
There are numerous depictions of ''tzompantli'' in [[Aztec codices]], dating from around the time or shortly after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], such as the [[Diego Durán#Literary works and influence|''Durán Codex'']], ''[[Ramírez Codex]]'', and ''[[Codex Borgia]]''. The [[Codex Mendoza]] contains multiple depictions of ''tzompantli.'' The Frontispiece of the Codex Mendoza depicts a ''tzompantli'' holding single skull next to an eagle perched on a cactus. A similar depiction of a ''tzompantli is'' used to represent the town of Tzompanco in the Codex Mendoza. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/codex-mendoza-1542/|title=Codex Mendoza (1542) – The Public Domain Review|website=publicdomainreview.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folio 45v of the Codex Borgia depicts a platform adorned with skulls. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.famsi.org/research/loubat/Borgia/thumbs0.html|title=FAMSI - Universitätsbibliothek Rostock - Codex Borgia (Loubat 1898)|website=www.famsi.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Recent excavations ====
Archaeologists affilitated with the National Institute of Anthropology and History have partaken in a series of excavations since 2015 that have resulted in the finding of ''tzompantli.'' These excavations took place near the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral and resulted in the finding of one ''tzompantli'' tower. These excavations have revealed that women and children were sacrificed, despite men making up 75% of sacrificial victims. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Association and meaning==
Apart from their use to display the skulls of ritualistically-executed war captives, ''tzompantli'' often occur in the contexts of [[Mesoamerican ballgame|Mesoamerican ball courts]], which were widespread throughout the region's civilizations and sites. The game was 'played for keeps' ending with the losing team being sacrificed. The captain of the winning team was tasked with taking the head of the losing team's captain to be displayed on a tzompantli.&lt;ref name=Coe1956 /&gt; In these contexts it appears that the tzompantli was used to display the losers' heads of this often highly ritualised game. Not all games resulted in this outcome, however, and for those that did it is surmised that these participants were often notable captives. An alternative theory is that it was the captain of the winning team who lost his head, but there is little evidence that this was the case.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell (1988) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Still, it is acknowledged that in Mesoamerican culture to be sacrificed was to be honored with feeding the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Coe and Koontz (2008) 204-205&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], the former [[Toltec]] capital, has a well-preserved ''tzompantli'' inscription on its ball court.

The association with ball courts is also reflected in the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the famous religious, mythological and cultural account of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]]. When [[Hun Hunahpu]], father of the [[Maya Hero Twins]], was killed by the lords of the Underworld ([[Xibalba]]), his head was hung in a [[gourd]] tree next to a ball court.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (2011) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The gourd tree is a clear representation of a "tzompantli", and the image of skulls in trees as if they were fruits is also a common indicator of a tzompantli and the associations with some of the game's metaphorical interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza (2007)pg 418&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary uses ==
''Tzompantli'' have been the subject of multiple artworks made by during the twentieth century. [[José Chávez Morado|Jose Chavez Morado]] depicted ''tzompantli'' in a 1961 painting. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marco.org.mx/programas/HojaSala_UnSiglo.pdf|title=La Colección de Arte Moderno|last=|first=|date=|work=Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; George O.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10583">In [[mathematics]], the '''uniform boundedness principle''' or '''Banach–Steinhaus theorem''' is one of the fundamental results in [[functional analysis]]. Together with the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] and the [[open mapping theorem (functional analysis)|open mapping theorem]], it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field.  In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of [[continuous linear operator]]s (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a [[Banach space]], pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.

The theorem was first published in 1927 by [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Hugo Steinhaus]] but it was also proven independently by [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]].

==Theorem==
'''Theorem (Uniform Boundedness Principle).''' Let ''X''  and ''Y'' be [[Banach space]]s. Suppose that ''F'' is a collection of continuous linear operators from ''X'' to ''Y''. If for all ''x'' in ''X'' one has

:&lt;math&gt;\sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T(x)\|_Y  &lt; \infty, &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\sup\nolimits_{T \in F,\|x\|=1} \|T(x)\|_Y=\sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T\|_{B(X,Y)}  &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
The completeness of ''X'' enables the following short proof, using the [[Baire category theorem]].

'''Proof.''' Suppose that for every ''x'' in the Banach space ''X'', one has:

:&lt;math&gt;\sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T (x)\|_Y  &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

For every integer &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, let

:&lt;math&gt; X_n = \left  \{x \in X \ : \ \sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T (x)\|_Y \le n \right \}. &lt;/math&gt;

The set &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[closed set]] and by the assumption,

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup\nolimits_{n \in \mathbf{N}} X_n = X \neq \varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[Baire category theorem]] for the non-empty [[complete metric space]]&amp;nbsp;''X'', there exists ''m'' such that 
&lt;math&gt; X_m&lt;/math&gt; has non-empty [[Interior (topology)|interior]], ''i.e.'', there exist &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in X_m&lt;/math&gt; and {{nowrap|ε &amp;gt; 0}} such that

:&lt;math&gt; \overline{B_\varepsilon (x_0)} := \{x \in X \,:\, \|x - x_0\| \le \varepsilon \} \subseteq  X_m.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''u'' ∈ ''X'' with {{nowrap|ǁ''u''ǁ &amp;le; 1}} and {{nowrap|''T'' ∈ ''F''}}.  One has that:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|T(u) \|_Y &amp;= \varepsilon^{-1} \left \|T \left( x_0 + \varepsilon u \right) - T(x_0) \right \|_Y    &amp; [\text{by linearity of } T ] \\
&amp;\leq \varepsilon^{-1} \left ( \left\| T (x_0 + \varepsilon u) \right\|_Y + \left\| T (x_0) \right\|_Y \right ) \\
&amp;\leq \varepsilon^{-1} (m + m).   &amp; [ \text{since} \ x_0 + \varepsilon u, \ x_0 \in X_m ] \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the supremum over ''u'' in the unit ball of&amp;nbsp;''X'' and over &lt;math&gt;T\in F&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt; \sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|T\|_{B(X,Y)}  \leq 2 \varepsilon^{-1} m &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

There are also simple proofs not using the Baire theorem {{harv|Sokal|2011}}.

==Corollaries==
'''Corollary.''' If a sequence of bounded operators (''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') converges pointwise, that is, the limit of {''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'')} exists for all ''x'' in ''X'', then these pointwise limits define a bounded operator ''T''.

Note it is not claimed above that ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to ''T'' in operator norm, i.e. uniformly on bounded sets. (However, since {''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is bounded in operator norm, and the limit operator ''T'' is continuous, a standard [[3-epsilon estimate|"3-ε" estimate]] shows that ''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to ''T'' uniformly on ''compact'' sets.)

'''Corollary.''' Any weakly bounded subset S in a normed space Y is bounded.''

Indeed, the elements of ''S'' define a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear forms on the Banach space ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Y*'', continuous dual of ''Y''.  By the uniform boundedness principle, the norms of elements of ''S'', as functionals on ''X'', that is, norms in the second dual ''Y**'', are bounded.  But for every ''s'' in ''S'', the norm in the second dual coincides with the norm in ''Y'', by a consequence of the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]].

Let ''L''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') denote the continuous operators from ''X'' to ''Y'', with the operator norm. If the collection ''F'' is unbounded in ''L''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y''), then by the uniform boundedness principle, we have:

:&lt;math&gt; R = \left \{ x \in X  \ : \ \sup\nolimits_{T \in F} \|Tx\|_Y = \infty \right \} \neq \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, ''R'' is dense in ''X''. The complement of ''R'' in ''X'' is the countable union of closed sets &amp;cup;''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. By the argument used in proving the theorem, each ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[nowhere dense]], i.e. the subset &amp;cup;''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''of first category''. Therefore ''R'' is the complement of a subset of first category in a  Baire space. By definition of a Baire space, such sets (called ''residual sets'') are dense. Such reasoning leads to the '''principle of condensation of singularities''', which can be formulated as follows:

'''Theorem.''' Let ''X'' be a Banach space, {''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} a sequence of normed vector spaces, and ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' a unbounded family in ''L''(''X'', ''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''). Then the set

:&lt;math&gt; R = \left \{ x \in X \ : \ \forall n \in \mathbf{N} : \sup\nolimits_{T \in F_n} \|Tx\|_{Y_n} = \infty \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

is of second category, and thus dense in ''X''.

'''Proof.''' The complement of ''R'' is the countable union

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup\nolimits_{n,m} \left \{ x \in X \ : \ \sup\nolimits_{T \in F_n} \|Tx\|_{Y_n} \le m \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

of sets of first category. Therefore its residual set ''R'' is dense.

==Example: pointwise convergence of Fourier series==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[circle group|circle]], and let &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt; be the Banach space of continuous functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, with the [[uniform norm]]. Using the uniform boundedness principle, one can show that there exists an element in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt; for which the Fourier series does not converge pointwise.

For &lt;math&gt;f \in C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;, its [[Fourier series]] is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k \in \mathbf{Z}} \hat{f}(k) e^{ikx} = \sum_{k \in \mathbf{Z}}\frac{1}{2\pi} \left (\int_0 ^{2 \pi} f(t) e^{-ikt} dt \right) e^{ikx},&lt;/math&gt;

and the ''N''-th symmetric partial sum is

:&lt;math&gt; S_N(f)(x) = \sum_{k=-N}^N \hat{f}(k) e^{ikx} =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0 ^{2 \pi} f(t) D_N(x - t) \, dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''N''-th [[Dirichlet kernel]]. Fix &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; and consider the convergence of {''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''(''f'')(''x'')}.  The functional φ&lt;sub&gt;''N,x''&lt;/sub&gt; : &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})\rightarrow \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{N, x} (f) =  S_N(f)(x), \qquad f \in C(\mathbb{T}),&lt;/math&gt;

is bounded.  The norm of φ&lt;sub&gt;''N,x''&lt;/sub&gt;, in the dual of &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;, is the norm of the signed measure (2π)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''D''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''−''t'')&amp;nbsp;d''t'', namely

:&lt;math&gt; \left \| \varphi_{N,x} \right \| =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0 ^{2 \pi} \left | D_N(x-t) \right  | \, dt =  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0 ^{2 \pi} \left | D_N(s) \right  | \, ds = \left \|  D_N \right \|_{L^1(\mathbb{T})}.&lt;/math&gt;

One can verify that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0 ^{2 \pi} | D_N(t) | \, dt \ge \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\left |\sin\left ( (N+\tfrac{1}{2})t \right )\right|}{t/2} \, dt \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

So the collection {φ&lt;sub&gt;''N,x''&lt;/sub&gt;} is unbounded in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})^\ast&lt;/math&gt;, the dual of &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore by the uniform boundedness principle, for any &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at ''x'' is dense in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;.

More can be concluded by applying the principle of condensation of singularities. Let {''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''} be a dense sequence in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;. Define φ&lt;sub&gt;''N,x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sub&gt; in the similar way as above. The principle of condensation of singularities then says that the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at each ''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' is dense in &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt; (however, the Fourier series of a continuous function ''f'' converges to ''f''(''x'') for almost every &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;, by [[Carleson's theorem]]).

== Generalisations ==
The least restrictive setting for the uniform boundedness principle is a [[barrelled space]] where the following generalised version of the theorem holds {{harv|Bourbaki|1987|loc=Theorem III.2.1}}:

'''Theorem.''' Given a barrelled space ''X'' and a [[locally convex space]] ''Y'', then any family of pointwise bounded [[continuous linear mapping]]s from ''X'' to ''Y'' is [[equicontinuous]] (even [[uniformly equicontinuous]]).

Alternatively, the statement also holds whenever ''X'' is a [[Baire space]] and ''Y'' is a locally convex space {{harv|Shtern|2001}}.

{{harvtxt|Dieudonné|1970}} proves a weaker form of this theorem with [[Fréchet space]]s rather than the usual Banach spaces.  Specifically,

'''Theorem.''' Let ''X'' be a Fréchet space, ''Y'' a normed space, and ''H'' a set of continuous linear mappings of ''X'' into ''Y''.  If for every ''x'' in ''X''
:&lt;math&gt;\sup\nolimits_{u\in H}\|u(x)\|&lt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt; 
then the family ''H'' is equicontinuous.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2901">In [[mathematics]], an '''unordered pair''' or '''pair set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of the form {''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''}, i.e. a set having two elements ''a'' and&amp;nbsp;''b'' with no particular relation between them. In contrast, an [[ordered pair]] (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') has ''a'' as its first element and ''b'' as its second element. 

While the two elements of an ordered pair (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') need not be distinct, modern authors only call {''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''} an unordered pair if ''a''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''b''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation | last1=Düntsch | first1=Ivo | last2=Gediga | first2=Günther | title=Sets, Relations, Functions | publisher=Methodos | series=Primers Series | isbn=978-1-903280-00-3 | year=2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Fraenkel | first1=Adolf | title=Einleitung in die Mengenlehre | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | year=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Roitman | first1=Judith | title=Introduction to modern set theory | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location=New York | isbn=978-0-471-63519-2 | year=1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Schimmerling | first1=Ernest | title=Undergraduate set theory | year=2008 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
But for a few authors a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] is also considered an unordered pair, although today, most would say that {a,a} is a [[multiset]]. It is typical to use the term unordered pair even in the situation where the elements a and b could be equal, as long as this equality has not yet been established.

A set with precisely two elements is also called a [[finite set|2-set]] or (rarely) a '''binary set'''.

An unordered pair is a [[finite set]]; its [[cardinality]] (number of elements) is 2 or (if the two elements are not distinct)&amp;nbsp;1.

In [[axiomatic set theory]], the existence of unordered pairs is required by an axiom, the [[axiom of pairing]].

More generally, an '''unordered '''''n'''''-tuple''' is a set of the form {''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...&amp;nbsp;''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''urial''' (''[[Ovis orientalis vignei|Ovis orientalis]] vignei''&lt;ref&gt;ICZN ([[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]]) [http://www.iczn.org/BZNMar2003opinions.htm opinion 2027] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517133446/http://www.iczn.org/BZNMar2003opinions.htm |date=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), also known as the '''arkars''' or '''shapo''', is a subspecies group of the wild [[Ovis|sheep]] ''Ovis orientalis''. Noticeable features are the reddish-brown long fur that fades during winter; males are characterized by a black ruff stretching from the neck to the chest and large horns.  It is found in western [[central Asia]].  The other subspecies group of ''O. orientalis'' is the [[mouflon]] (''Ovis orientalis orientalis'' group). The two groups have often been considered separate species.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Grubb (zoologist)|Grubb, Peter]] (2005). Order Perissodactyla. Pp. 708-710 in: Wilson, Don E., and DeeAnn, M. (2005). ''Mammal Species of the World. A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference''. 3d edition. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. {{ISBN|0-8018-8221-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==
Urial males have large horns, curling outwards from the top of the head turning in to end somewhere behind the head; females have shorter, compressed horns. The horns of the males may be up to {{Convert|100|cm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long. The [[shoulder]] height of an adult male urial is between {{Convert|80|and|90|cm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}.

== Distribution ==
The urial is found in western central [[Asia]] from northeastern [[Iran]] and western [[Kazakhstan]] to [[Pakistan]]'s [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] and [[Chitral]], as well as being found in [[Ladakh]], [[India]]. To the east it is replaced by the bigger [[argali]] and to the southwest by the [[Asiatic mouflon]]. Its habitat consists of [[grass]]y slopes below the [[tree line|timberline]]. Urials rarely move to the rocky areas of the mountains. For example, in northern Iran they produce hybrids with Asiatic mouflon under natural conditions. Urials feed mainly on grass but are able to eat leaves of trees and bushes if needed.

The [[conservation status]] of the urial is threatened as their habitat is perfectly suitable for [[human]] development; however the urial [[population]] has been recovering in recent years.

The Afghan urial is found in Musakhel district in Surghar and Torghar. A 2005-2006 survey by WWF Pakistan shows 145 urials found in Surghar, Srakhowa District Musakhe. Yahay Musakhel ''et al.'' 2006)

== Behaviour ==
The [[mating]] season begins in September. Rams (which live separately at other times) select four or five ewes, which will each give birth to a lamb after a [[gestation]] of five months.

== Subspecies ==
[[File:Ovis ammon vignei arkal Pretoria 3bis.jpg|thumbnail|Transcaspian arkals (''O. o. arkal'') at [[Pretoria Zoo]]]]
The ''vignei'' subspecies group consists of six individual subspecies:

*'''Afghan urial''' or '''Turkmenian sheep''' (''[[Ustyurt Mountain sheep|Ovis orientalis cycloceros]]''): southern [[Turkmenistan]], eastern [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], north Balochistan [[Pakistan]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org.pk/undp/sgp/green-pioneers/chap-13.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Transcaspian urial''' (''[[Ovis orientalis arkal]]''): Ustjurt-Plateau ([[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], northern [[Iran]]) and western [[Kazakhstan]]
*'''Blanford urial''' or '''Balochistan urial''' (''[[Ovis orientalis blanfordi]]''): [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan (Pakistan)]] are often included in this subspecies
*'''Bukhara urial''' (''[[Ovis orientalis bochariensis]]''): [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], mountains around [[Amu Darya]]
*'''Punjab urial''' (''[[Ovis orientalis punjabiensis]]''): the provincial animal of the [[Punjab (Pakistan)]]
*'''Ladakh urial''' (''[[Ovis orientalis vignei]]''): [[Ladakh]] and northern [[Pakistan]], [[Kashmir]], males have curly horns but the females have flat horns
