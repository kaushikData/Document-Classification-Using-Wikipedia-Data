      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2875">'''Advancing Secondary Science Education thru Tetrahymena''' ([[Asset (disambiguation)|ASSET]]) is an [[organization]] at [[Cornell University]] that is dedicated to expanding the use of the protist ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' in K-12 classrooms.  They are funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] through the SEPA (Science Education Partnership Award) Program.  Although their name includes the word "secondary," they have worked in recent years to develop materials for students in elementary, middle and high schools.  The group develops modules, which are stand-alone labs or lessons that can be inserted into the curriculum of a class at the discretion of the teacher.

==Modules==

Modules are designed to be stand-alone lessons that fit into and compliment a life [[science]] curriculum.  The ASSET program ships all the equipment that is needed to complete the modules to the [[teacher]] in a reusable plastic container, at ASSET's expense. The teacher who requested the materials can use them for up to two weeks.  At the end of the two weeks, the teacher uses a pre-paid return label to send the materials back in the same container.  Some materials, such as live cells, may be sent separately to provide for a chance for the [[culture]] to be established in the teacher's classroom.

===Science Modules===

ASSET has created fifteen science modules, each of which addresses a particular topic relevant to life science education in [[United States]] school curricula.

====Cannibalism and Interspecefic Predation====

This module utilizes two species of ''[[Tetrahymena]]'':  ''Tetrahymena thermophilia'' and ''Tetrahymena vorax''.   In the lab, an extract, called [[stomatin]], is made from the thermophilia, then placed into the vorax culture.  There, it induces a transformation from the microstome form to the macrostome form in T. vorax.  This transformation is most notable by a marked increase in the size of the cell (doubling or sometimes more), the resorption of the microstomal oral apparatus and the construction of a much larger macrostomal oral apparatus.  This transformation allows the macrostomal T. vorax cells to prey on T. thermophilia, but also to cannibalize the microstomes of their own species.&lt;ref name="vorax paper"&gt;[http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/14/2089.long] In the polymorphic ciliate Tetrahymena vorax, the non-selective phagocytosis seen in microstomes changes to a highly selective process in macrostomes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and Society Modules===

ASSET has also created five science and society modules, which are designed to integrate social studies and science education into one unit.

===Elementary School Modules===

[[File:Rooftop Packaged Units.JPG|thumb|270px|A rooftop packaged unit or RTU]]
An '''air handler''', or '''air handling unit''' (often abbreviated to '''AHU'''), is a device used to regulate and circulate air as part of a heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning ([[HVAC]]) system.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE&gt;{{cite book|title=2008 ASHRAE handbook : heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems and equipment|year=2008|publisher=ASHRAE American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=9781933742335|edition=Inch-Pound}}&lt;/ref&gt; An air handler is usually a large metal box containing a [[Fan (mechanical)|blower]], heating or cooling elements, [[air filter|filter]] racks or chambers, sound attenuators, and [[damper (architecture)|dampers]].&lt;ref name=Carrier&gt;{{cite book|title=Carrier Design Manual part 2: Air Distribution|year=1960|publisher=Carrier Corporation|edition=1974 tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air handlers usually connect to a [[Duct (HVAC)|ductwork]] [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation system]] that distributes the conditioned air through the building and returns it to the AHU.  Sometimes AHUs discharge (''supply'') and admit (''return'') air directly to and from the space served without ductwork.

Small air handlers, for local use, are called '''terminal units''', and may only include an air filter, coil, and blower; these simple terminal units are called [[blower coil]]s or [[fan coil unit]]s.  A larger air handler that conditions 100% outside air, and no recirculated air, is known as a '''makeup air unit''' ('''MAU''').  An air handler designed for outdoor use, typically on roofs, is known as a '''packaged unit''' ('''PU''') or '''rooftop unit''' ('''RTU''').

==Construction==
The air handler is normally constructed around a framing system with metal infill panels as required to suit the configuration of the components. In its simplest form the frame may be made from metal channels or sections, with single skin metal infill panels. The metalwork is normally [[galvanized]] for long term protection. For outdoor units some form of weatherproof lid and additional sealing around joints is provided.&lt;ref name=Carrier/&gt;

Larger air handlers will be manufactured from a square section steel framing system with double skinned and [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] infill panels. Such constructions reduce heat loss or heat gain from the air handler, as well as providing [[acoustic attenuation]].&lt;ref name=Carrier/&gt; Larger air handlers may be several meters long and are manufactured in a ''sectional'' manner and therefore, for strength and rigidity, steel section base rails are provided under the unit.&lt;ref name=Carrier/&gt;

Where supply and extract air is required in equal proportions for a balanced ventilation system, it is common for the supply and extract air handlers to be joined together, either in a ''side-by-side'' or a ''stacked'' configuration.

==Components==
The major types of components are described here in approximate order, from the return duct (input to the AHU), through the unit, to the supply duct (AHU output).&lt;ref name=ASHRAE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carrier/&gt;

===Filters===
{{main|Air filter}}
Air filtration is almost always present in order to provide clean dust-free air to the building occupants. It may be via simple [[Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value|low-MERV]] pleated media, [[HEPA]], [[Electrostatic precipitator|electrostatic]], or a combination of techniques. Gas-phase and ultraviolet air treatments may be employed as well.

Filtration is typically placed first in the AHU in order to keep all the downstream components clean. Depending upon the grade of filtration required, typically filters will be arranged in two (or more) successive banks with a coarse-grade panel filter provided in front of a fine-grade bag filter, or other "final" filtration medium. The panel filter is cheaper to replace and maintain, and thus protects the more expensive bag filters.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE/&gt;

The life of a filter may be assessed by monitoring the pressure drop through the filter medium at design air volume flow rate. This may be done by means of a visual display using a pressure gauge, or by a pressure switch linked to an alarm point on the building control system. Failure to replace a filter may eventually lead to its collapse, as the forces exerted upon it by the fan overcome its inherent strength, resulting in collapse and thus contamination of the air handler and downstream ductwork.

===Heating and/or cooling elements===
{{main|Heat exchanger#HVAC air coils}}
Air handlers may need to provide heating, cooling, or both to change the supply air temperature, and humidity level depending on the location and the application. Such conditioning is provided by heat exchanger coil(s) within the air handling unit air stream, such coils may be ''direct'' or ''indirect'' in relation to the medium providing the heating or cooling effect.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carrier/&gt;

Direct heat exchangers include those for gas-fired fuel-burning heaters or a [[refrigeration]] [[evaporator]], placed directly in the air stream. [[Heating element|Electric resistance]] heaters and [[heat pump]]s can be used as well. [[Evaporative cooling]] is possible in dry climates.

Indirect [[Heat exchanger#HVAC air coils|coils]] use hot [[water]] or [[steam]] for heating, and chilled water for cooling (prime energy for heating and cooling is provided by central plant elsewhere in the building). Coils are typically manufactured from copper for the tubes, with copper or aluminium fins to aid heat transfer. Cooling coils will also employ eliminator plates to remove and drain condensate. The hot water or steam is provided by a central [[boiler]], and the chilled water is provided by a central [[chiller]]. Downstream temperature sensors are typically used to monitor and control "off coil" temperatures, in conjunction with an appropriate motorized control valve prior to the coil. 

If [[dehumidification]] is required, then the cooling coil is employed to ''over-cool'' to that the [[dew point]] is reached and condensation occurs. A heater coil placed after the cooling coil re-heats the air (therefore known as a ''re-heat coil'') to the desired supply temperature. This process has the effect of reducing the [[relative humidity]] level of the supply air.

In colder climates, where winter temperatures regularly drop below freezing, then ''frost coils'' or ''pre-heat'' coils are often employed as a first stage of air treatment to ensure that downstream filters or chilled water coils are protected against freezing. The control of the frost coil is such that if a certain off-coil air temperature is not reached then the entire air handler is shut down for protection.

===Humidifier===
{{main|Humidifier}}
Humidification is often necessary in colder climates where continuous heating will make the air drier, resulting in uncomfortable air quality and increased [[Electrostatics|static electricity]]. Various types of humidification may be used:
*[[Humidifier#Evaporative humidifiers|Evaporative]]: dry air blown over a reservoir will evaporate some of the water. The rate of evaporation can be increased by spraying the water onto baffles in the air stream.
*[[Humidifier#Vaporizers|Vaporizer]]: steam or vapor from a boiler is blown directly into the air stream.
*[[Humidifier#Spray mist|Spray mist]]: water is diffused either by a nozzle or other mechanical means into fine droplets and carried by the air.
*[[ultrasonic humidifier|Ultrasonic]]: A tray of fresh water in the airstream is excited by an ultrasonic device forming a fog or water mist.
*Wetted medium: A fine fibrous medium in the airstream is kept moist with fresh water from a header pipe with a series of small outlets. As the air passes through the medium it entrains the water in fine droplets. This type of humidifier can quickly clog if the primary air filtration is not maintained in good order.

===Mixing chamber===
{{Main|Air-mixing plenum}}
In order to maintain indoor air quality, air handlers commonly have provisions to allow the introduction of outside air into, and the exhausting of air from the building. In temperate climates, mixing the right amount of cooler outside air with warmer return air can be used to approach the desired supply air temperature. A mixing chamber is therefore used which has [[damper (architecture)|dampers]] controlling the ratio between the return, outside, and exhaust air.

===Blower/fan===
{{main|Mechanical fan|Centrifugal fan}}
Air handlers typically employ a large [[Centrifugal fan|squirrel cage blower]] driven by an AC induction [[electric motor]] to move the air. The blower may operate at a single speed, offer a variety of set speeds, or be driven by a [[variable-frequency drive]] to allow a wide range of [[airflow|air flow]] rates. Flow rate may also be controlled by inlet vanes or outlet dampers on the fan. Some residential air handlers in USA (central "furnaces" or "air conditioners") use a [[brushless DC electric motor]] that has variable speed capabilities.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE/&gt;  Air handlers in Europe and Australia and New Zealand now commonly use backward curve fans without scroll or "plug fans".  These are driven using high efficiency EC (electronically commutated) motors with built in speed control. 

Multiple blowers may be present in large commercial air handling units, typically placed at the end of the AHU and the beginning of the supply ductwork (therefore also called "supply fans"). They are often augmented by fans in the return air duct ("return fans") pushing the air into the AHU.

===Balancing===
Un-balanced fans wobble and vibrate.  For home AC fans, this can be a major problem: air circulation is greatly reduced at the vents (as wobble is lost energy), efficiency is compromised, and noise is increased. Another major problem in fans that are not balanced is longevity of the bearings (attached to the fan and shaft) is compromised. This can cause failure to occur long before the bearings life expectancy.

Weights can be strategically placed to correct for a smooth spin (for a ceiling fan, trial and error placement typically resolves the problem). Home / central AC fans or other big fans are typically taken to shops, which have special balancers for more complicated balancing (trial and error can cause damage before the correct points are found).  The fan motor itself does not typically vibrate.

===Heat recovery device===
{{main|Heat recovery ventilation}}
A heat recovery device [[heat exchanger]] may be fitted to the air handler between supply and extract airstreams for energy savings and increasing capacity. These types more commonly include for:
* [[Recuperator]], or Plate Heat exchanger: A sandwich of plastic or metal plates with interlaced air paths. Heat is transferred between airstreams from one side of the plate to the other. The plates are typically spaced at 4 to 6mm apart. Heat recovery efficiency up to 70%.
* [[Thermal Wheel]], or Rotary heat exchanger: A slowly rotating matrix of finely corrugated metal, operating in both opposing airstreams. When the air handling unit is in heating mode, heat is absorbed as air passes through the matrix in the exhaust airstream, during one half rotation, and released during the second half rotation into the supply airstream in a continuous process. When the air handling unit is in cooling mode, heat is released as air passes through the matrix in the exhaust airstream, during one half rotation, and absorbed during the second half rotation into the supply airstream. Heat recovery efficiency up to 85%. Wheels are also available with a [[hydroscopic|hydroscopic coating]] to provide latent heat transfer and also the drying or humidification of airstreams.
* [[Run around coil]]: Two air to liquid heat exchanger coils, in opposing airstreams, piped together with a circulating pump and using water or a brine as the heat transfer medium. This device, although not very efficient, allows heat recovery between remote and sometimes multiple supply and exhaust airstreams.  Heat recovery efficiency up to 50%.
* [[Heat Pipe]]: Operating in both opposing air paths, using a confined [[refrigerant]] as a heat transfer medium. The heat pipe uses multiple sealed pipes mounted in a coil configuration with fins to increase heat transfer. Heat is absorbed on one side of the pipe, by evaporation of the refrigerant, and released at the other side, by condensation of the refrigerant. Condensed refrigerant flows by gravity to the first side of the pipe to repeat the process. Heat recovery efficiency up to 65%.

===Controls===
{{main|Building automation|Building management system}}
[[HVAC control system|Controls]] are necessary to regulate every aspect of an air handler, such as: [[airflow|flow rate of air]], supply air temperature, mixed air temperature, humidity, air quality. They may be as simple as an off/on [[thermostat]] or as complex as a [[building automation]] system using [[BACnet]] or [[LonWorks]], for example.

Common control components include temperature sensors, humidity sensors, sail switches, [[actuator]]s, motors, and controllers.

===Vibration isolators===
The blowers in an air handler can create substantial vibration and the large area of the duct system would transmit this noise and vibration to the occupants of the building. To avoid this, vibration isolators (flexible sections) are normally inserted into the duct immediately before and after the air handler and often also between the fan compartment and the rest of the AHU. The rubberized canvas-like material of these sections allows the air handler components to vibrate without transmitting this motion to the attached ducts.

The fan compartment can be further isolated by placing it on a spring suspension, which will mitigate the transfer of vibration through the floor.

{{see also|Beaumont and Fletcher}}
'''The Beaumont and Fletcher folios''' were two large [[book size|folio]] collections of the stage plays of [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and his collaborators. The first was issued in 1647, and the second in 1679. The two collections were important in preserving many works of [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance drama]].

==The first folio, 1647==
The 1647 folio was published by the booksellers [[Humphrey Moseley]] and [[Humphrey Robinson]]. It was modelled on the precedents of the first two folio collections of [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Shakespeare's plays]], published in 1623 and 1632, and the first two folios of the [[Ben Jonson folios|works of Ben Jonson]] of 1616 and 1640–1. The title of the book was given as ''Comedies and Tragedies Written by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher Gentlemen,'' though the prefatory matter in the folio recognised that [[Philip Massinger]], rather than [[Francis Beaumont]], collaborated with Fletcher on some of the plays included in the volume. (In fact, the 1647 volume "contained almost nothing of Beaumont's" work.)&lt;ref&gt;Lee Bliss, in Kinney, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen works in Fletcher's canon that had already been published prior to 1647, and the rights to these plays belonged to the stationers who had issued those volumes; Robinson and Moseley therefore concentrated on the previously unpublished plays in the Fletcher canon.

Most of these plays had been acted onstage by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], the troupe of actors for whom Fletcher had functioned as house dramatist for most of his career. The folio featured a dedication to [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke]], signed by ten of the King's Men – [[John Lowin]], [[Joseph Taylor (17th-century actor)|Joseph Taylor]], [[Richard Robinson (17th-century actor)|Richard Robinson]], [[Robert Benfield]], [[Eliard Swanston]], Thomas Pollard, Hugh Clark, William Allen, [[Stephen Hammerton]], and [[Theophilus Bird]] – all idled by the closing of the theatres in 1642. It also contained two addresses to the reader, by [[James Shirley]] and by Moseley, and 37 [[commendatory poem]]s, long and short, by figures famous and obscure, including Shirley, [[Ben Jonson]],&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, a decade dead by 1647, was posthumously represented with an excerpt from his poem to Beaumont.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Lovelace]], [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[Richard Brome]], [[Jasper Mayne]], [[Thomas Stanley (author)|Thomas Stanley]], and Sir [[Aston Cockayne]].

The 1647 folio contains 35 works – 34 plays and 1 [[masque]].

The 1647 folio has attracted significant attention from scholars and bibliographers, and various specialised studies of the folio (books on the book) have been written.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 83–5.&lt;/ref&gt; As with Shakespeare's [[First Folio]], the typesetting of individual compositors and the work of individual printers has been traced and analysed – including that of Susan Islip, one of the rare instances of a female printer in the 17th century.

==The second folio, 1679==
The second folio, titled ''Fifty Comedies and Tragedies,'' was published by the booksellers [[Henry Herringman]],&lt;ref&gt;Herringman was a member of the syndicates of stationers who issued the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Fourth Folio]] of Shakespeare's plays in 1685, and the [[Ben Jonson folios|third Ben Jonson folio]] in 1692.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Martyn (publisher)|John Martyn]], and [[John and Richard Marriot|Richard Marriot]]; the printing was done by J. Macock. The three stationers had obtained the rights to previously-published works,&lt;ref&gt;The 17 printed before 1647, and ''[[The Wild Goose Chase]],'' which had been published in 1652.&lt;/ref&gt; and added 18 dramas to the 35 of the first folio, for a total of 53. The second folio added features that the first lacked. Many songs in the plays were given in full. Cast lists were prefixed to 25 of the dramas, lists that provide the names of the leading actors in the original productions of the plays. These lists can be informative on the companies involved and the dates of first productions; the cast list prefixed to ''[[The Honest Man's Fortune]],'' for example, reveals that the play was originally staged by the [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] in the 1612–13 period.

On the negative side, the texts in the second folio were set into type from the previously-printed quarto texts, and never from manuscript; the texts of the plays in the first collection were printed from manuscript sources.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content, authorship, and canon==

The implicit canon, nearly realized by the contents of the second folio, comprises dramatic works written by Beaumont or Fletcher; either alone, together, or in collaboration with other playwrights. By this rule, likely, four plays should be excluded (''The Laws of Candy'' by [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]], ''Wit at Several Weapons'' by [[Thomas Middleton|Middleton]] and [[William Rowley|Rowley]], ''The Nice Valour'' by Middleton, and ''The Coronation'' by [[James Shirley]]), and three more extant plays should be included (''Barnavelt'', ''A Very Woman'', and ''Henry VIII''). ''[[A Very Woman]]'' was printed in a volume of Massinger's plays in 1655, while ''[[Sir John van Olden Barnavelt]]'' remained in manuscript until the 19th century. ''Henry VIII'' was first published in the Shakespeare [[First Folio]] of 1623.

At least five plays, no longer extant, may also belong in the canon. Four of these were entered to Moseley in the [[Stationers' Register]] between 1653 and 1660, possibly with the intent of printing them in the second folio: ''[[The History of Cardenio|Cardenio]]'' (Shakespeare and Fletcher?), ''A Right Woman'' (Beaumont and Fletcher?), ''The Wandering Lovers'' (Fletcher?), and ''The Jeweler of Amsterdam'' (Fletcher, Field, and Massinger?). A fifth non-extant play, ''The Queen'' was questionably attributed to Fletcher by a contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 1966, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_pBDWgpg_AwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR31#v=onepage&amp;f=false p xxxi].&lt;/ref&gt;

The folios contain two works that are generally thought to be the work of Beaumont alone – ''The Knight of the Burning Pestle'' and ''The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn'' – and fifteen that are solo efforts by Fletcher, and perhaps a dozen that are actual Beaumont/Fletcher collaborations. The rest are Fletcher's collaborations with Massinger and other writers.

==Later editions==
The folios limited but did not extinguish the market for individual editions of the plays; such editions were printed when the chances for profit seemed favourable. Humphrey Robinson and Alice Moseley (Humphrey Moseley's widow) issued a quarto of ''Beggar's Bush'' in 1661, for example. During the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era and into the 18th century, the plays in the Beaumont/Fletcher canon were very popular – though they were often performed in adapted versions rather than in the originals; and the adaptations then appeared in print. An adaptation of ''The Island Princess'' was published in 1669; and adapted version of ''Monsieur Thomas'' was printed in 1678.  ''Beggar's Bush'' became ''The Royal Merchant,'' published in 1706 – and later, ''The Merchant of Bruges.''&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend in favour of new adaptations over original versions made it easier for Herringman, Martyn, and Mariot to obtain permissions to reprint those originals in their 1679 collection.

'''Brookhaven National Laboratory''' ('''BNL''') is a [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|United States Department of Energy national laboratory]] located in [[Upton, New York]], on [[Long Island]], and was formally established in 1947 at the site of [[Camp Upton]], a former [[List of United States Army installations|U.S. Army base]]. Its name stems from its location within the [[Brookhaven, New York|Town of Brookhaven]], approximately 60 miles east of [[New York City]].

Research at BNL specializes in nuclear and high energy physics, energy science and technology, environmental and bioscience, nanoscience and national security. The 5,300 acre campus contains several large research facilities, including the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] and [[National Synchrotron Light Source II]]. Seven [[Nobel prize]]s have been awarded for work conducted at Brookhaven lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/history/nobel/ |title=Nobel Prizes at BNL |publisher=Bnl.gov |access-date=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
BNL is staffed by approximately 2,750 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support personnel, and hosts 4,000 guest investigators every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/about/|title=About BNL|publisher=BNL.gov|accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory has its own police station, fire department, and [[ZIP code]] (11973).  In total, the lab spans a {{convert|5265|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} area that is mostly coterminous with the hamlet of [[Upton, New York]]. BNL is served by a rail spur operated as-needed by the [[New York and Atlantic Railway]]. Co-located with the laboratory is the Upton, New York, forecast office of the [[National Weather Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/okx/ |title=NWS Forecast Office New York, NY |date=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation===
Brookhaven National Lab was originally owned by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and is now owned by that agency's successor, the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE). DOE subcontracts the research and operation to universities and research organizations.  It is currently operated by Brookhaven Science Associates LLC, which is an equal partnership of [[Stony Brook University]] and [[Battelle Memorial Institute]]. From 1947 to 1998, it was operated by [[Associated Universities, Inc.]] (AUI), but AUI lost its contract in the wake of two incidents: a 1994 fire at the facility's high-beam flux reactor that exposed several workers to radiation and reports in 1997 of a tritium leak into the groundwater of the [[Long Island Central Pine Barrens]] on which the facility sits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10614FD3B5A1B7B93C3A91788D85F438485F9 Atomic Laboratory on Long Island to Be Mighty Research Center – New York Times – March 1, 1947]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1997/5/21/laboratory-loses-federal-contract-pin-fallout/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundations===
Following [[World War II]], the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|US Atomic Energy Commission]] was created to support government-sponsored peacetime research on atomic energy. The effort to build a [[nuclear reactor]] in the American northeast was fostered largely by physicists [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] and [[Norman Foster Ramsey Jr.]], who during the war witnessed many of their colleagues at [[Columbia University]] leave for new remote research sites following the departure of the [[Manhattan Project]] from its campus. Their effort to house this reactor near [[New York City]] was rivalled by a similar effort at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to have a facility near [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Involvement was quickly solicited from representatives of northeastern universities to the south and west of [[New York City]] such that this city would be at their geographic center. In March 1946 a nonprofit corporation was established that consisted of representatives from nine major research universities — [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[University of Rochester]], and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crease |first=Robert P. |date= 1999|title= Making Physics: A Biography of Brookhaven National Laboratory|url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soldier_records,_Camp_Upton_(LOC)_(23546348723).jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers during [[World War I]] at the [[Camp Upton]] site,  which would in 1947 be repurposed as BNL]]
Out of 17 considered sites in the Boston-Washington corridor, [[Camp Upton]] on [[Long Island]] was eventually chosen as the most suitable in consideration of space, transportation, and availability. The camp had been a training center from the [[United States Army|US Army]] during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  After the latter war, Camp Upton was deemed no longer necessary and became available for reuse. A plan was conceived to convert the military camp into a research facility.

On March 21, 1947, the Camp Upton site was officially transferred from the [[U.S. War Department]] to the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)]], predecessor to the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]].

===Research and facilities===
====Reactor history====
In 1947 construction began on the first [[nuclear reactor]] at Brookhaven, the [[Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor]]. This reactor, which opened in 1950, was the first reactor to be constructed in the United States after World War II.  The [[High Flux Beam Reactor]] operated from 1965 to 1999. In 1959 Brookhaven built the first US reactor specifically tailored to medical research, the [[Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor]], which operated until 2000.

====Accelerator history====
[[File:Satoshi Ozaki 1991.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[Satoshi Ozaki]] posed with a magnet for the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] in 1991]]
In 1952 Brookhaven began using its first [[particle accelerator]], the [[Cosmotron]]. At the time the Cosmotron was the world's highest energy accelerator, being the first to impart more than 1 [[GeV]] of energy to a particle. The Cosmotron was retired in 1966, after it was superseded in 1960 by the new [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] (AGS). The AGS was used in research that resulted in 3 [[Nobel prize]]s, including the discovery of the [[muon neutrino]], the [[charm quark]], and [[CP violation]]. The [[National Synchrotron Light Source]] operated from 1982 to 2014 and was involved with two Nobel Prize-winning discoveries. It has since been replaced by the [[National Synchrotron Light Source II]]. The [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC) has been operational since 2000. One of the world's only two operating heavy-ion colliders, RHIC is as of 2010 the second-highest-energy collider after the [[Large Hadron Collider]]. RHIC is housed in a tunnel 2.4 miles (3.9&amp;nbsp;km) long and is visible from space.

====Other discoveries====

In 1958, Brookhaven scientists created one of the world's first [[video game]]s, [[Tennis for Two]]. In 1968 Brookhaven scientists patented [[Maglev]], a transportation technology that utilizes [[magnetic levitation]].

It is a contributing partner to [[ATLAS experiment]], one of the four detectors located at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC).  It is currently operating at [[CERN]] near [[Geneva]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/ATLAS/|title=BNL {{!}} Brookhaven and the Large Hadron Collider|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brookhaven was also responsible for the design of the SNS accumulator ring in partnership with [[Spallation Neutron Source]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].

Brookhaven plays a role in a range of neutrino research projects around the world, including the [[Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment]] in China and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/science/neutrinos.php|title=BNL {{!}} Neutrino Research History|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public access==
[[File:National Synchrotron Light Source II.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior of [[National Synchrotron Light Source II]] facility in 2012, during a Brookhaven National Laboratory "Summer Sundays" public tour.]]
For other than approved Public Events, the Laboratory is closed to the general public. The lab is open to the public on several Sundays during the summer for tours and special programs. The public access program is referred to as 'Summer Sundays' and takes place on four Sundays from mid-July to mid-August, and features a science show and a tour of the lab's major facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/stakeholder/summersundays.php|title=BNL {{!}} Summer Sundays|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory also hosts science fairs, science bowls, and robotics competitions for local schools, and lectures, concerts, and scientific talks for the local community. The Lab estimates that each year it enhances the science education of roughly 35,000 kindergarten to 12th grade LI students, more than 200 undergraduates, and 550 teachers from across the United States.

== Controversy and environmental cleanup ==
In January 1997, ground water samples taken by BNL staff revealed concentrations of tritium that were twice the allowable federal drinking water standards—some samples taken later were 32 times the standard. The tritium was found to be leaking from the laboratory's High Flux Beam Reactor's spent-fuel pool into the aquifer that provides drinking water for nearby Suffolk County residents.

DOE's and BNL's investigation of this incident concluded that the tritium had been leaking for as long as 12 years without DOE's or BNL's knowledge. Installing wells that could have detected the leak was first discussed by BNL engineers in 1993, but the wells were not completed until 1996. The resulting controversy about both BNL's handling of the tritium leak and perceived lapses in DOE's oversight led to the termination of AUI as the BNL contractor in May 1997.

The responsibility for failing to discover Brookhaven's tritium leak has been acknowledged by laboratory managers, and DOE admits it failed to properly oversee the laboratory's operations. Brookhaven officials repeatedly treated the need for installing monitoring wells that would have detected the tritium leak as a low priority despite public concern and the laboratory's agreement to follow local environmental regulations. DOE's on-site oversight office, the Brookhaven Group, was directly responsible for Brookhaven's performance, but it failed to hold the laboratory accountable for meeting all of its regulatory commitments, especially its agreement to install monitoring wells. Senior DOE leadership also shared responsibility because they failed to put in place an effective system that encourages all parts of DOE to work together to ensure that contractors meet their responsibilities on environmental, safety and health issues. Unclear responsibilities for environment, safety and health matters has been a recurring problem for DOE management.

Since 1993, DOE has spent more than US$580 million on remediating soil and groundwater contamination at the lab site and completed several high-profile projects. These include the decommissioning and decontamination of the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/brookhaven-lab-reactor-fully-decommissioned-1.4027164|title=Lab reactor fully decommissioned|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; removal of mercury-contaminated sediment from the Peconic River, and installation and operation of 16 on- and off-site groundwater treatment systems that have cleaned more than 25 billion gallons of groundwater since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/community/cleanup/|title=Environmental Cleanup, Brookhaven National Laboratory|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after winning the contract to operate the lab in 1997, BSA formed a Community Advisory Council (CAC) to advise the laboratory director on cleanup projects and other items of interest to the community. The CAC represents a diverse range of interests and values of individuals and groups who are interested in or affected by the actions of the Laboratory. It consists of representatives from 26 local business, civic, education, environment, employee, government, and health organizations. The CAC sets its own agenda, brings forth issues important to the community, and works to provide consensus recommendations to Laboratory management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/stakeholder/cac.php|title=BNL {{!}} Community Advisory Council|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pompe funebre for Katarzyna Opalińska.jpg|thumb|''Castrum doloris'' of Queen [[Katarzyna Opalińska]]]]
'''Castrum doloris''' ([[Latin]] for ''castle of grief'') is a name for the structure and decorations sheltering or accompanying the [[catafalque]] or [[bier]] that signify the prestige or high estate of the deceased. A ''castrum doloris'' might feature an elaborate [[baldachin]] and would include [[candle]]s, possibly [[flower]]s, and in most cases [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], [[epitaph]]s and possibly [[allegorical]] [[statue]]s. Many extensive ''castra doloris'' can be traced to the customs of 17th century and 18th century or even earlier, since Pope Sixtus V's funeral arrangements included a ''castrum doloris'' in the late 16th Century.

Notable examples include [[coffin portrait]] ({{lang-pl|portret trumienny}}) of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

'''Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs''', (or '''CAAHEP'''), is an agency of [[accreditation]]  for the accredits postsecondary education programs in 28 health science fields.

Programmatic accreditation is granted after an education program is reviewed and it is determined that the program is in compliance with the profession's accreditation Standards.&lt;ref&gt;The profession's accreditation Standards designate what an entry-level health care employee in a particular field needs to know in order to be successful in that field&lt;/ref&gt; A not-for-profit organization, CAAHEP is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA). It is based in [[Clearwater, Florida]].

== Members and leadership ==

*CAAHEP's members are organizations that represent the professions accredited by CAAHEP and/or the institutions that teach CAAHEP accredited programs.
*CAAHEP's leadership is composed of both a Commission and a Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caahep.org/Member-Organizations-and-Their-Commissioners/ CAAHEP Commissioners and Board of Directors]&lt;/ref&gt;

The individuals who serve as Commissioners are representatives from CAAHEP's sponsoring organizations, along with a recent graduate of a CAAHEP accredited program and members of the general public.  The Commissioners approve the organization's mission, vision, and bylaws, and decide which health science professions qualify to take part in the CAAHEP accreditation system.  CAAHEP is also led by a Board of Directors, whose members are elected from among the Commissioners.When an education program in a health science profession seeks CAAHEP accreditation, the program will work with that profession's Committee on Accreditation (CoA).&lt;ref&gt;It is the CoA that leads the program through accreditation process, reviewing the self-study, organizing the site visit of the program, and formulating the accreditation recommendation of the program for approval by the CAAHEP Board of Directors&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief History ==

In 1904, the [[American Medical Association]] established its Council on Medical Education (CME). The CME developed a rating system of medical schools in 1905, initiated inspections in 1906, and classified the institutions in 1907. The AMA then collaborated with the Carnegie Foundation to conduct a study of the quality of medical education that resulted in the [[Flexner Report]] in 1910. These early efforts subsequently led to the development of specialized accreditation for the education of health professionals. It was also the precursor of accreditation activities for most other professional associations.

Early in the 1930s, several national bodies requested the collaboration of the AMA in establishing accreditation for education programs in their areas of interest. These early efforts established a basis and pattern for the role of the AMA in collaborating with other national associations for the accreditation of health sciences education programs. From 1935 through 1976, the recognized agency was the AMA Council on Medical Education. In 1976 the CME delegated to the newly formed Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation (CAHEA) the responsibility and authority for health sciences education accreditation. In October, 1992 the AMA announced its intent to support the establishment of a new and independent agency to assume the accreditation responsibilities of CAHEA&lt;ref&gt;That new agency, the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) was incorporated in May, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs Accredited by CAAHEP==

CAAHEP accredits over 2,200 programs in 28 health science disciplines. The programs reside in more than 1,300 postsecondary educational institutions across the United States and [[Canada]].

{{Refimprove|date=February 2008}}
'''Cosmic pluralism''', the '''plurality of worlds''', or simply '''pluralism''', describes the philosophical belief in numerous "[[world]]s" ([[planet]]s, [[dwarf planet]]s or [[natural satellite]]s) in addition to [[Earth]] (possibly an infinite number), which may harbour [[extraterrestrial life]].

The debate over pluralism began as early as the time of [[Anaximander]] (c. 610 – c. 546 BC) as a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical argument]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], ''Commentary on Aristotle's Physics'', 1121, 5–9&lt;/ref&gt; long predating the scientific [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican conception]] that the Earth is one of numerous [[planet]]s. It has continued, in a variety of forms, until the modern era.

==Ancient Greek debates==
In [[Ancient Greece|Greek times]], the debate was largely philosophical and did not conform to present notions of [[cosmology]]. Cosmic pluralism was a corollary to notions of infinity and the purported multitude of life-bearing worlds were more akin to parallel universes (either contemporaneously in space or infinitely recurring in time) than to different solar systems. After [[Anaximander]] opened the door to an infinite universe, a strong pluralist stance was adopted by the [[atomists]], notably [[Leucippus]], [[Democritus]], and [[Epicurus]]. While these were prominent thinkers, their opponents—[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]—had greater effect. They argued that the Earth is unique and that there can be no other systems of worlds.&lt;ref name=crowe1999&gt;

==Medieval Islamic thought==
Many medieval Muslim scholars endorsed the idea of cosmic pluralism. Imam [[Muhammad al-Baqir]]  (676–733) wrote "Maybe you see that God created only this single world and that God did not create humans besides you. Well, I swear by God that God created thousands and thousands of worlds and
thousands and thousands of humankind."&lt;ref name =Weintraub/&gt;

[[Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi]] (1149–1209), in dealing with his conception of physics and the physical world in his Matalib, rejects the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] notion of the Earth's centrality within the universe. Instead he argues that there are "a thousand thousand worlds (alfa alfi 'awalim) beyond this world such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world as well as having the like of what this world has."&lt;ref name =Weintraub&gt;David A. Weintraub (2014). "Islam," ''Religions and Extraterrestrial Life'' (pp 161-168). Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; To support his theological argument, he cites the [[Qur'an]]ic verse, "All praise belongs to God, Lord of the Worlds," in surah [[fatiha]] emphasizing the term "Worlds."

Two Qur'anic verses support the idea of God being Lord of multiple worlds: 1:2 and 41:09. Qur'an 16:8 says "He has created other things of which ye have no knowledge."&lt;ref name =Weintraub/&gt;

Cosmic pluralism was depicted in fictional [[Arabic literature]]. "[[The Adventures of Bulukiya]]", a tale from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), depicted a [[cosmos]] consisting of different worlds, some larger than Earth and each with their own inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=204 &amp; 209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholastic thinkers==
Eventually the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian system was challenged and pluralism reasserted, first tentatively by [[scholastics]] and then more seriously by followers of [[Copernicus]]. The [[telescope]] appeared to prove that a multitude of life was reasonable and an expression of God's creative omnipotence; still powerful theological opponents, meanwhile, continued to insist that although the Earth may have been displaced from the center of the cosmos, it was still the unique focus of God's creation. Thinkers such as [[Johannes Kepler]] were willing to admit the possibility of pluralism without truly supporting it.

==Renaissance==
[[Giordano Bruno]] introduced in his works the idea of multiple worlds instantiating the infinite possibilities of a pristine, indivisible One. Bruno (from the mouth of his character Philotheo) in his ''De l'infinito universo et mondi'' (1584) claims that "innumerable celestial bodies, stars, globes, suns and earths may be sensibly perceived therein by us and an infinite number of them may be inferred by our own reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Teaching this was among the charges the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisition]] made against him.&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Firpo, Il processo di Giordano Bruno, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enlightenment==
During the [[Scientific Revolution]] and the later [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], cosmic pluralism became a mainstream possibility. [[Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle]]'s ''[[Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes]]'' (''Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds'') of 1686 was an important work from this period, speculating on pluralism and describing the new Copernican cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/2529.html Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]— Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism was also championed by philosophers such as [[John Locke]], astronomers such as [[William Herschel]] and even politicians, including [[John Adams]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. As greater [[scientific skepticism]] and rigour were applied to the question it ceased to be simply a matter of philosophy and theology and was properly bounded by astronomy and biology.

The French astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] was one of the chief proponents of cosmic pluralism during the latter half of the nineteenth century. His first book, ''La pluralité des mondes habités'' (1862) was a great popular success, going through 33 editions in its first twenty years. Flammarion was one of the first people to put forward the idea that extraterrestrial beings were genuinely alien, and not simply variations of earthly creatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/Flammarion.html Flammarion, (Nicolas) Camille (1842–1925)]— The Internet Encyclopedia of Science&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern thought==
In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries the term "cosmic pluralism" became largely archaic as knowledge diversified and the speculation on extraterrestrial life focused on particular bodies and observations. The historic debate continues to have modern parallels, however. [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Frank Drake]], for instance, could well be considered "pluralists" while proponents of the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]] are modern skeptics.

Modern Islamic scholars like [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] point to the Qur'an (42:29) to argue for life on other planets: "And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the living creatures that He has scattered through them". The verses uses the word ''da’bbah'', which denotes living creatures on the surface of a planet.&lt;ref name =Weintraub/&gt;

The '''Decadent Movement''' was a late 19th-century [[Art movement|artistic]] and [[literary movement|literary]] movement, centered in [[Western Europe]], that followed an aesthetic ideology of excess and artificiality. The visual artist [[Félicien Rops]]'s body of work and [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]'s novel ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'' (1884) are considered the prime examples of the decadent movement. It first flourished in France and then spread throughout Europe and to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Critical Theory - Oxford Reference, pp.113-114&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was characterized by self-disgust, sickness at the world, general skepticism, delight in perversion and employment of crude humor and a belief in the superiority of [[human creativity]] over logic and the natural world.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Symbolist Landscapes: The Place of Painting in the Poetry and Criticism of Mallarmé and His Circle|last=Kearns|first=James|publisher=MHRA|year=1989|isbn=094762323X|location=|pages=15|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the Grain|last=Huysmans|first=Joris-Karl|publisher=Lieber &amp; Lewis|year=1922|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from the writings of [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher who suggested that the decline (''[[decadence|décadence]]'') of the Roman Empire was in large part due to their moral decay and loss of cultural standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.constitution.org/cm/ccgrd_l.htm|title=Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline|last=Montesqieu|first=Charles-Louis de Secondat|publisher=The Free Press, New York.  Collier-Macmillan, London.|others=Translated by David Lowenthal|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Constitution Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When Latin scholar [[Désiré Nisard]] turned toward French literature, he compared [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general to the Roman decadence, men sacrificing their craft and their cultural values for the sake of pleasure.  The trends that he identified, such as an interest in description, a lack of adherence to the conventional rules of literature and art, and a love for extravagant language were the seeds of the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desmarais|first=Jane|date=|year=2013|others=Edited by Jane Ford, Kim Edwards Keates, Patricia Pulham|title=Perfume Clouds: Olfaction, Memory, and Desire in Arthur Symon's London Nights (1895)|url=|journal=Economies of Desire at the Victorian Fin de Siècle: Libidinal Lives|volume=|page=|pages=62–82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French Decadent Movement ===
The first major development in French decadence would come when writers [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] used the word proudly, to represent a rejection of what they considered banal "progress."&lt;ref name="Drowninginlimbo"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=0947757813|title=An anthology of French symbolist &amp; decadent writing|publisher=Atlas Press|year=1994|isbn=0947757813|page=12|author=Remy de Gourmont|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire referred to himself as decadent in his 1857 edition of [[Les Fleurs du mal|''Les Fleurs du Mal'']] and exalted the Roman decline as a model for modern poets to express their passion. He would later use the term ''decadence'' to  include the subversion of traditional categories in pursuit of full, sensual expression.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism|last=Calinescu|first=Matei|publisher=Duke University|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his lengthy introduction to Baudelaire in the front of the 1868 ''Les Fleurs du Mal,'' Gautier at first rejects the application of the term  decadent, as meant by the critic, but then works his way to an admission of decadence on Baudelaire's own terms: a preference for what is beautiful and what is exotic, an ease with surrendering to fantasy, and a maturity of skill with manipulating language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gautier|first=Theophile|year=1868|others=Collection authored by Charles Baudelaire|title=Charles Baudelaire|url=|journal=Les Fleurs du Mal|volume=|pages=|via=WikiSource (France)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he was Belgian, [[Félicien Rops]] was instrumental in the development of this early stage of the Decadent Movement.  A friend of Baudelaire,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Censorship Effect: Baudelaire, Flaubert, and the Formation of French Modernism|last=Olmsted|first=William|publisher=Oxford|year=2016|isbn=9780190238636|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also a frequent illustrator of Baudelaire's writing, at the request of the author himself.  Rops delighted in breaking artistic convention and shocking the public with gruesome, fantastical horror.  He was explicitly interested in the Satanic, and he frequently sought to portray the double-threat of Satan and Woman.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Egoists, a Book of Supermen: Stendahl, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Anatole France, Huysmans, Barrès, Nietzsche, Blake, Ibsen, Stirner, and Ernest Hello|last=Huneker|first=James|publisher=|year=1909|isbn=0404105254|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Kindle Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Colour of Angels: Cosmology, Gender and the Aesthetic Imaginatio|last=Classen|first=Constance|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0415180740|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At times, his only goal was the portrayal of a woman he'd observed debasing herself in the pursuit of her own pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle|last=Adams|first=Jad|publisher=Tauris Parke|year=2008|isbn=1845116844|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested that, no matter how horrific and perverse his images could be, Rops' invocation of supernatural elements was sufficient to keep Baudelaire situated in a spiritually-aware universe that maintained a cynical kind of hope, even if the poetry "requires a strong stomach."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Their work was the worship of beauty disguised as the worship of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Baudelaire: A Study|last=Symons|first=Arthur|publisher=Eklin Matthews|year=1920|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For both of them, mortality and all manner of corruptions were always on their mind.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The ability of Rops to see and portray the same world as they did, made him a popular illustrator for other decadent authors.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The concept of decadence lingered after that, but it wasn't until 1884 that Maurice Barrès referred to a particular group of writers as ''Decadents.'' He defined this group as those who had been influenced heavily by Baudelaire, though they were also influenced by [[Gothic novel]]s and the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].  Many were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], others with [[Aestheticism]].&lt;ref name="Stephan1974"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRoNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165|title=Paul Verlaine and the Decadence, 1882-90|first=Philip|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1974|isbn=978-0-7190-0562-6|location=|page=|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Stephan|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/symbolist/texts/decadence_chronology.html A Chronology], retrieved December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weir1995"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOb26cxGBfMC&amp;pg=PA16|title=Decadence and the Making of Modernism|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87023-992-2|page=16|author=David Weir|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pursuit of these authors, according to [[Arthur Symons]], was "a desperate endeavor to give sensation, to flash the impression of the moment, to preserve the very heat and motion of life," and their achievement, as he saw it, was "to be a disembodied voice, and yet the voice of a human soul."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harpers.org/sponsor/balvenie/arthur-symons.1.html|title=The Decadent Movement in Literature|last=Symons|first=Arthur|date=1893|website=Harpers.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1884 decadent novel ''[[À rebours|À Rebours]] (''English, ''Against Nature'' or ''Against the Grain''), [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] overthrew the past, subordinated nature to the human creative will, and suggested the primacy of, but inherent disillusion in, pleasure.  He also identified likely candidates for the core of the Decadent Movement, which he seemed to view Baudelaire as sitting above: [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Tristan Corbière]], Theodore Hannon, and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].  His character Des Esseintes hailed these writers for their creativity and their craftsmanship, suggesting that they filled him with "insidious delight" as they used a "secret language" to explore "twisted and precious ideas."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Not only did ''Against Nature'' define an ideology and a literature, but it also created an influential perspective on visual art.  The character of Des Esseintes explicitly heralded the work of [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Jan Luyken]], and [[Odilon Redon]].  None of these artists would have identified themselves as part of this movement.  Nevertheless, the choice of these three established a decadent perspective on art which favored madness and irrationality, graphic violence, frank pessimism about cultural institutions, and a disregard for visual logic of the natural world.  It has also been suggested that a dream vision that Des Esseintes describes is based on the series of satanic encounters painted by Félicien Rops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valazza|first=Nicolas|year=2010|others=Edited by Amaleena Damle and Aurelie L'Hostis|title=The Flower and the Monster: On Huysmans' Painters|url=|journal=The Beautiful and the Monstrous: Essays in French Literature, Thought and Culture|series=Modern French Identities|volume=|page=96|pages=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitalizing on the momentum of Huysmans' work, Anatole Baju founded the magazine ''Le Décadent'' in 1886, an effort to define and organize the Decadent Movement in a formal way.  This group of writers did not only look to escape the boredom of the banal, but they also sought to shock, scandalize, and subvert the expectations and values of society, believing that such freedom and creative experimentation would better humanity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Not everyone was comfortable with Baju and ''Le Décadent,'' even including some who had been published in its pages.  Rival writer [[Jean Moréas]] published his [[Symbolist Manifesto]], largely to escape association with the Decadent Movement, despite their shared heritage.  Moréas and [[Gustave Kahn]], among others, formed rival publications to reinforce the distinction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legitimizing the Artist: Manifesto Writing and European Modernism, 1885-1915|last=Somigli|first=Luca|publisher=University of Toronto|year=2003|isbn=1442657731|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Verlaine embraced the label at first, applauding it as a brilliant marketing choice by Baju.  After seeing his own words exploited and tiring of ''Le Décadent'' publishing works falsely attributed to [[Arthur Rimbaud]], however, Verlaine came to sour on Baju personally, and he eventually rejected the label, as well.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

Decadence continued on in France, but it was limited largely to Anatole Baju and his followers, who refined their focus even further on perverse sexuality, material extravagance, and up-ending social expectations.  Far-fetched plots were acceptable if they helped generate the desired moments of salacious experience or glorification of the morbid and grotesque.  Writers who embraced the sort of decadence featured in ''Le Décadent'' include [[Albert Aurier]], [[Rachilde]], Pierre Vareilles, [[Miguel Hernández|Miguel Fernandez]], [[Jean Lorrain]], and [[Laurent Tailhade|Laurent Tailhaide]].  Many of these authors did also publish symbolist works, however, and it unclear how strongly they would have identified with Baju as decadents.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In France, the Decadent Movement is often said to have begun with either [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'' (1884) or  Baudelaire's ''Les Fleur du Mal''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiocleo.com/librarie/baudelaire/essay.html ''Baudelaire and the Decadent Movement''] by [[Paul Bourget]], retrieved December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  This movement essentially gave way to Symbolism when ''Le Décadent'' closed down in 1889 and Anatole Baju turned toward politics and became associated with anarchy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  A few writers continued the decadent tradition, such as Octave [[Octave Mirbeau|Mirbeau]], but Decadence was no longer a recognized movement, let alone a force in literature or art.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought|last=Everdell|first=William R.|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1997|isbn=9780226224817|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the association of decadence with cultural decline, it is not uncommon to associate decadence in general with transitional times and their associated moods of pessimism and uncertainty.  In France, the heart of the Decadent Movement was during the 1880s and 1890s, the time of [[fin de siècle]], or end-of-the-century gloom.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  As part of that overall transition, many scholars of Decadence, such as [[David Weir (academic)|David Weir]], regard Decadence as a dynamic transition between [[Romanticism]] and [[Modernism]], especially considering the decadent tendency to dehumanize and distort in the name of pleasure and fantasy.&lt;ref name="Weir1995" /&gt;

=== Distinction from Symbolism ===
[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] has often been confused with the Decadent Movement. Arthur Symons, a British poet and literary critic contemporary with the movement, at one time considered Decadence in literature to be a parent category that included both Symbolism and [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionism]], as rebellions against realism.  He defined this common, decadent thread as, "an intense self-consciousness, a restless curiosity in research, an over-subtilizing refinement upon refinement, a spiritual and moral perversity."  He referred to all such literature as, "a new and beautiful and interesting disease."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Later, however, he would go on to instead describe the Decadent Movement as an "interlude, half a mock interlude" that distracted critics from seeing and appreciating the larger and more important trend, which was the development of Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Symbolist Movement in Literature|last=Symons|first=Arthur|publisher=E. P. Dutton|year=1919|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is true that the two groups share an ideological descent from Baudelaire and for a time they both considered themselves as part of one sphere of new, anti-establishment literature.  They worked together and met together for quite a while, as if they were part of the same movement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Maurice Barrès referred to this group as decadents, but he also referred to one of them (Stéphane Mallarmé) as a symbolist.  Even Jean Moréas used both terms for his own group of writers as late as 1885.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

Only a year later, however, [[Jean Moréas]] wrote his [[Symbolist Manifesto]] to assert a difference between the symbolists with whom he allied himself and this the new group of decadents associated with Anatole Baju and ''Le Décadent''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;  Even after this, there was sufficient common ground of interest, method, and language to  blur the lines more than the manifesto might have suggested.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

In the world of visual arts, it can be even more difficult to distinguish decadence from symbolism.  In fact, Stephen Romer has referred to [[Félicien Rops]], [[Gustave Moreau]], and Fernand Khnopff as "Symbolist-Decadent painters and engravers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=French Decadent Tales|last=Romer|first=Stephen|publisher=Oxford|year=2013|isbn=0199569274|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are clear ideological differences between those who continued on as symbolists and those who have been called "dissidents" for remaining in the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Philip|year=1972|title=Naturalist Influences on Symbolist Poetry, 1882-86.|url=|journal=The French Review|volume=46|pages=299–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, there was little doubt that Baju and his group were producing work that was decadent, but there is frequently more question about the work of the symbolists.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

In a website associated with Dr. Petra Dierkes-Thrun's [[Stanford University]] course, Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents (2014), a student named Reed created a blog post that is the basis for much of what follows.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wildedecadence.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/the-differences-between-symbolism-and-decadence/|title=The Differences between Symbolism and Decadence|date=2014-03-03|website=Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== On Nature ====
Both groups reject the primacy of nature, but what that means for them is very different.  Symbolism uses extensive natural imagery as a means to elevate the viewer to a plane higher than the banal reality of nature itself, as when Stéphane Mallarmé mixes descriptions of flowers and heavenly imagery to create a transcendent moment in "Flowers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/54372|title=Flowers|last=Mallarmé|first=Stéphane|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decadence, in contrast, actually belittles nature in the name of artistry. In Huysmans’ ''Against Nature'', for instance, the main character Des Esseintes says of nature: “There is not one of her inventions, no matter how subtle or imposing it may be, which human genius cannot create . . . There can be no doubt about it: this eternal, driveling, old woman is no longer admired by true artists, and the moment has come to replace her by artifice."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== On Language and Imagery ====
Symbolism treats language and imagery as devices that can only approximate meaning and merely evoke complex emotions and call the mind toward ideas it might not be able to comprehend.  In the words of symbolist poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Languages are imperfect because multiple; the supreme language is missing... no one can utter words which would bear the miraculous stamp of Truth Herself Incarnate... how impossible it is for language to express things... in the Poet's hands... by the consistent virtue and necessity of an art which lives on fiction, it achieves its full efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallarmé|first=Stéphane|year=1956|others=Translated by Bradford Cook|title=from Crisis in Poetry|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/0076/mallarme.PDF|journal=Mallarmé: Selected Prose Poems, Essays &amp; Letters|volume=|pages=|via=Scan from an un-cited anthology on Amerhert's website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Moréas would go on to assert in his manifest on symbolism, words and images serve to dress up the incomprehensible in such a way that it can be approached, if not understood.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mutablesound.com/home/?p=2165|title=Symbolist Manifesto|last=Moréas|first=Jean|date=1886|website=Mutable Sound|others=Translated by C. Liszt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decadence, on the other hand, sees no path to higher truth in words and images.  Instead, books, poetry, and art itself as the creators of valid new worlds, thus the allegory of decadent Wilde's [[The Picture of Dorian Gray|Dorian Gray]] being poisoned by a book like a drug.  Words and artifice are the vehicles for human creativity, and Huysmans suggests that the illusions of fantasy have their own reality: "The secret lies in knowing how to proceed, how to concentrate deeply enough to produce the hallucination and succeed in substituting the dream reality for the reality itself."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== On Reality, Illusion, and Truth ====
Both groups are disillusioned with the meaning and truth offered by the natural world, rational thought, and ordinary society.  Symbolism turns its eyes toward Greater Purpose or on the Ideal, using dreams and symbols to approach these esoteric primal truths.  In Mallarme's poem “Apparition”, for instance, the word “dreaming” appears twice, followed by “Dream” itself with a capital D. In “The Windows,” he speaks of this decadent disgust of contentment with comfort and an endless desire for the exotic. He writes: “So filled with disgust for the man whose soul is callous, sprawled in comforts where his hungering is fed.” In this continuing search for the spiritual, therefore, Symbolism has been predisposed to concern itself with purity and beauty and such mysterious imagery as those of fairies.

In contrast, Decadence says there is no oblique approach to ultimate truth, because there is no secret, mystical truth.  They despise the very idea of searching for such a thing.  If there is truth of value, it is purely in the sensual experience of the moment.  The heroes of Decadent novels, for instance, have the unquenchable accumulation of luxuries and pleasure, often exotic, as their goal, would have space in its search for thrills for even the gory and the shocking.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In [[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (book)|''The'' ''Temptation of Saint Anthony'']], decadent [[Gustave Flaubert]] describes Saint Anthony's pleasure from watching disturbing scenes of horror.  Later Czech decadent Arthur Breisky has been quoted by scholars as speaking to both the importance of illusion and of beauty: "But isn’t it necessary to believe a beautiful mask more than reality?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bugge|first=Peter|year=2006|title=Naked Masks: Arthur Breisky or How to Be a Czech Decadent|url=http://slovoasmysl.ff.cuni.cz/node/123|journal=Word and Sense: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Theory and Criticism in Czech Studies|volume=|pages=|access-date=19 February 2017|via=Word and Sense website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== On Art ====
Ultimately, the distinction may best be seen in their approach to art. Symbolism is an accumulation of “symbols” that are there not to present their content but to evoke greater ideas that their symbolism cannot expressly utter.  According to Moréas, it is an attempt to connect the object and phenomena of the world to "esoteric primordial truths" that cannot ever be directly approached.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Decadence, on the other hand, is an accumulation of signs or descriptions acting as detailed catalogs of human material riches as well as artifice.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It was Oscar Wilde who perhaps lay this out most clearly in ''[[The Decay of Lying]]'' with the suggestion of three doctrines on art, here excerpted into a list:
# "Art never expresses anything but itself."
# "All bad art comes from returning to Life and Nature, and elevating them into ideals."
# "Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life"
After which, he suggested a conclusion quite in contrast to Moréas' search for shadow truth: "Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Wilde_1889.html|title=The Decay of Lying|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=|year=1889|isbn=|location=|pages=|access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence and legacy ==

=== Collapse of the Decadent Movement ===
In France, the Decadent Movement could not withstand the loss of its leading figures. Many of those associated with the Decadent Movement became symbolists after initially associating freely with decadents.  Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé were among those, though both had been associated with Baju's ''Le Décadent'' for a time.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;  Others kept a foot in each camp.  Albert Aurier wrote decadent pieces for ''Le Décadent'' and also wrote symbolist poetry and art criticism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Decadent writer Rachilde was staunchly opposed to a symbolist take over of ''Le Décadent''&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt; even though her own one-act drama ''The Crystal Spider'' is almost certainly a symbolist work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiebuzinska|first=Christine|year=1994|title=Behind the Mirror: Madame Rachilde's "The Crystal Spider"|url=|journal=Modern Language Studies|volume=24|pages=28–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, once strong voices for decadence, abandoned the movement altogether.  Joris-Karl Huysmans grew to consider ''Against Nature'' as the starting point on his journey into Roman Catholic symbolist work and the acceptance of hope.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Anatole Baju, once the self-appointed school-master of French decadence, came to think of the movement as naive and half-hearted, willing to tinker and play with social realities, but not to utterly destroy them.  He left decadence for anarchy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The Decadent Movement beyond France ===
While the Decadent Movement, per se, was truly a French phenomenon, the impact was felt more broadly.  Typically, the influence was felt as an interest in pleasure, an interest in experimental sexuality, and a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged with a somewhat [[Transgressive fiction|trangressive]] spirit and an aesthetic that values material excess.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=Harvard University|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Frankel|editor-first=Nicholas|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many were also influenced by the Decadent Movement's aesthetic emphasis on art for its own sake.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Ruth|year=2015|others=Edited by Jane Ford, Kim Edwards Keates, Patricia Pulham|title=Always Leave Them Wanting More: Oscar Wilde's Salmoe and the Failed Cicrulations of Desire|url=|journal=Economies of Desire at the Victorian Fin de Siècle: Libidinal Lives|volume=|pages=21–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bohemia'''

Czech writers who were exposed to the work of the Decadent Movement saw in it the promise of a life they could never know.  They were neither aristocrats nor bored bourgeoisie.  They were poor and hungry for something better.  The dreams of the decadents gave them that something better, but something that was hopelessly unattainable.  It was that melancholy that drove their art.  These Bohemian decadent writers included [[Karel Hlaváček]], Arnošt Procházka, [[Jiří Karásek ze Lvovic]], and Louisa Zikova.  One Czech writer, [[Arthur Breisky]], embraced the full spirit of ''Le Décadent'' with its exultation in material excess and a life of refinement and pleasure.  From the Decadent Movement he learned the basic idea of a [[dandy]], and his work is almost entirely focused on developing a philosophy in which the Dandy is the consummate human, surrounded by riches and elegance, theoretically above society, just as doomed to death and despair as they.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pynsent|first=Robert|year=1973|title=A Czech Dandy: An Introduction to Arthur Breisky|url=|journal=The Slavonic and East European Review|volume=51|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Britain'''
[[File:Beardsley-peacockskirt.PNG|thumb|upright|Aubrey Beardsley, ''[[The Peacock Skirt]]'', illustration for [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'', 1892]]

Though influenced through general exposure but also direct contact, the leading decadent figures in Britain associated with decadence were Irish writer [[Oscar Wilde]], poet [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], and illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]], as well as other artists and writers associated with ''[[The Yellow Book]]''. Others, such as [[Walter Pater]], resisted association with the movement, even though their works seemed to reflect similar ideals.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Decadent Republic of Letters: Taste, Politics, and Cosmopolitan Community from Baudelaire to Beardsley|last=Potolsky|first=Matthew|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2012|isbn=0812244494|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While most of the influence was from figures such as Baudelaire and Verlaine, there was also very strong influence at times from more purely decadent members of the French movement, such as the influence that Huysmans and Rachilde had on Wilde, as seen explicitly in ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/october/rachilde-wilde-discovery-10-21-2014.html|title=Rebellious French cross-dresser played an overlooked role in shaping Oscar Wilde's legacy, Stanford scholar says|last=Beacock|first=Ian|date=21 October 2014|website=Stanford News|others=Scholarship by Petra Dierkes-Thrun|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British decadents embraced the idea of creating art for its own sake, pursuing all possible desires, and seeking material excess.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  At the same time, they were not shy about using the tools of decadence for social and political purpose. Beardsley had an explicit interest in the improvement of the social order and the role of art-as-experience in inspiring that transformation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Oscar Wilde published an entire work exploring socialism as a liberating force: "Socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others which, in the present condition of things, presses so hardly upon almost everybody."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Soul of Man Under Socialism|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=Arthur L. Humphreys|year=1909|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swinburne wrote explicitly addressed Irish-English politics in poetry, as when he wrote, "Thieves and murderers, hands yet red with blood and tongues yet black with lies | Clap and clamour--'Parnell spurs his Gladstone well!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swinburne|first=Algernon Charles|year=1886|title=The Commonweal: A Song for Unionists|url=|journal=A Channel Passage and Other Poems|volume=|pages=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many of their personal lives, they also pursued decadent ideals.  Wilde had a secret homosexual life.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Swinburne had an obsession with flagellation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

'''Russia'''

[[File:Evfimia Nosova (Ryabushinskaya) by N.Feofilaktov (1913, priv.coll).jpg|thumb|Portrait of {{ill|Euphemia Pavlova Nosova|ru|Носова, Евфимия Павловна}} by {{ill|Nikolai Kalmakov|ru|Калмаков, Николай Константинович}}]]
The Decadent Movement reached into Russia primarily through exposure to the writings of Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine.  The earliest Russian adherents lacked idealism and focused on such decadent themes as subversion of morality, disregard for personal health, and living in blasphemy and sensual pleasure.  Russian writers were especially drawn to the morbid aspects of decadence and in the fascination with death.  Dmitry Merezhkovsky is thought to be the first to clearly promote a Russian decadence that included the idealism that would eventually inspire the French symbolists to disassociate from the more purely materialistic Decadent Movement.  The first Russian writers to achieve success as followers of this Decadent Movement included Konstanin Balmont, [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Valery Bryusov]], and [[Zinaida Gippius]].  As they refined their craft beyond imitation of Baudelaire and Verlaine, most of these authors became much more clearly aligned with symbolism than with decadence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bristol|first=Evelyn|year=1980|title=Idealism and Decadence in Russian Symbolist Poetry|url=|journal=Slavic Review|volume=39|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some visual artists adhered to the Baju-esque late Decadent Movement approach to sexuality as purely an act of pleasure, often ensconced in a context of material luxury.  They also shared the same emphasis on shocking society, purely for the scandal. Among them were [[Konstantin Somov]], {{ill|Nikolai Kalmakov|ru|Калмаков, Николай Константинович}}, and Nikolay Feofilaktov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowlt|first=John E.|year=1982|title=Through the Glass Darkly: Images of Decadence in Early Twentieth-Century Russian Art|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=17|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spain'''

Some art historians consider [[Francisco de Goya]] one of the roots of the Decadent movement in Spain, almost 100 years before its start in France. Their works were a cry of denouncement against injustice and oppression. However, Ramón Casas and José María López Mezquita can be considered the model artists of this period. Their paintings are an image of the social conflicts and police repression that was happening in Spain at the time.
Spaniard writers also wanted to be part of this movement. [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]] with works like [[Los Pazos de Ulloa]] where terror and decadent topics appear. [[El monstruo]] (The Monster), written by [[Antonio de Hoyos y Vinent]] belongs to Decadent Movement. But the Decadent Movement is overlapped by the [[Fin de Siglo Movement]] with the authors of the [[Generación del 98]] being part-decadent: [[Ramón María del Valle-Inclán]], [[Unamuno]] and [[Pío Baroja]] are the most essential figures of this period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Spanish Novel: From 1600 to the Present|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn= 9781139000222 |location=|pages= 138|quote=|via=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-companion-to-the-spanish-novel/decadence-and-innovation-in-fin-de-siglo-spain/DBB78766FF30C8855E20D9F9A59286B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''United States'''

Few prominent writers or artists in the [[United States]] were connected with the Decadent Movement.  Those who were connected struggled to find an audience, for Americans were reluctant to see value for them in what they considered the art forms of [[fin de siècle]] France.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landscapes of Decadence: Literature and Place at the Fin de Siècle|last=Murray|first=Alex|publisher=Cambridge|year=2016|isbn=1107169666|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poet [[Francis Saltus Saltus]] was inspired by Charles Baudelaire, and his unpracticed style was occasionally compared to the French poet's more refined experimentation.  He embraced the most debauched lifestyle of the French decadents and celebrated that life in his own poetry.  At the time, mostly before Baju's ''Le Décadent'', this frivolous poetry on themes of alcohol and depravity found little success and no known support from those who were part of the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man in the Mirror: William Marion Reedy and His Magazine|last=Putzel|first=Max|publisher=University of Missouri|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=43|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The younger brother of Francis, writer [[Edgar Saltus]] had more success.  He had some interaction with Oscar Wilde, and he valued decadence in his personal life.  For a time, his work exemplified both the ideals and style of the movement, but a significant portion of his career was in traditional journalism and fiction that praised virtue.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decadent Culture in the United States: Art and Literature Against the American Grain, 1890 - 1926|last=Weir|first=David|publisher=State University of New York|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time when he was flourishing, however, multiple contemporary critics, as well as other decadent writers, explicitly considered him one of them.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Writer James Huneker was exposed to the Decadent Movement in France and tried to bring it back with him to New York.  He has been lauded to his dedication to this cause throughout his career, but it has also been suggested that, while he lived as a decadent and heralded their work, his own work was more frustrated, hopeless, and empty of the pleasure that had attracted him to the movement in the first place.  Largely, he focused on cynically describing the impossibility of a true American decadence.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Critical studies ==
German doctor and social critic [[Max Nordau]] wrote a lengthy book entitled ''[[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|Degeneration]]'' (1892).  It was an examination of decadence as a trend, and specifically attacked several people associated with the Decadent Movement, as well as other figures throughout the world who deviated from cultural, moral, or political norms.  His language was colorful and vitriolic, often invoking the worship of Satan.  What made the book a success was its suggestion of a medical diagnosis of "degeneration," a neuro-pathology  that resulted in these behaviors.  It also helped that the book named such figures as Oscar Wilde, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Paul Verlaine, and Maurice Barrès, members of the Decadent Movement who were in the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J. A.|first=|year=1895|title=Max Nordau's Degeneration|url=|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 Italian art and literature critic [[Mario Praz]] completed a broad study of morbid and erotic literature, translated and published in English as ''The Romantic Agony'' (1933).  The study included decadent writing (such as Baudelaire and Swinburne), but also anything else that he considered dark, grim, or sexual in some way.  His study centered on the 18th and 19th Centuries.  The danger of such literature, he believed it unnaturally elevated the instinctive bond between pain and pleasure and that, no matter the artists' intention, the essential role of art is to educate and teach culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mumford Jones|first=Howard|year=1936|title=Reviewed Work: The Romantic Agony. by Mario Praz, Angus Davidson|url=|journal=Modern Language Notes|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electrical capacitance tomography''' ('''ECT''') is a method for determination of the dielectric [[permittivity]] distribution in the interior of an object from external capacitance measurements. It is a close relative of [[electrical impedance tomography]]&lt;ref&gt;M Soleimani, W R B Lionheart, Nonlinear image reconstruction in electrical capacitance tomography using experimental data, Meas. Sci. Technol., 16, 2005, pp 1987–1996 
&lt;/ref&gt; and is proposed as a method for industrial process monitoring, although it has yet to see widespread use. Potential applications include the measurement of flow of fluids in pipes&lt;ref&gt;Jaworski AJ and Dyakowski T, Application of electrical capacitance tomography for measurement of gas–solid flow characteristics in a pneumatic conveying system, Measurement Science and Technology, 12, 2001, pp 1109–19
&lt;/ref&gt; and measurement of the concentration of one fluid in another, or the distribution of a solid in a fluid. 

Although capacitance sensing methods were in widespread use the idea of using capacitance measurement to form images is attributed to [[Maurice Beck]] and co-workers at [[UMIST]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;S M Huang, A Plaskowski, C G Xie and M S Beck, Capacitance-based tomographic flow imaging system, Electronics Letters, 24 (7), 1988, pp 418–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although usually called [[tomography]], the technique differs from conventional tomographic methods, in which high resolution images are formed of slices of a material. The measurement electrodes, which are metallic plates, must be sufficiently large to give a measureable change in capacitance. This means that very few electrodes are used and eight or twelve electrodes is common. An N-electrode system can only provide N(N&amp;minus;1)/2 independent measurements. This means that the technique is limited to producing very low resolution images of approximate slices. However, ECT is fast, and relatively inexpensive.

The results of the EVI are used to focus on planned solutions to negative pressures on the environment, whilst promoting sustainability.

== Development == 
The beginning stages of the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) were developed to be appropriate for [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDs), this theoretical idea at the time was presented by the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] (SOPAC) on February 4, 1999.  The ideas and plans for The Environmental Vulnerability Index were worked on further with the creation of a (EVI) Think Tank that took place from September 7 – September 10, 1999 in Pacific Harbour, Fiji. Expanding the (EVI) to other SIDS was aided by a meeting of experts convened in Malta on November 29 – December 3, 1999 by (SOPAC) and the Foundation for International Studies (of the University of Malta’s Islands and Small States Institute) with the support of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP).

During the second phase of the development, the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) was tested in five different countries. A workshop was made to expand the application of the Environmental Vulnerability Index to a demonstrative set of countries from around the world. The workshop was hosted by UNEP in Geneva, Switzerland on August 27-August 29, 2001.  Continuation of work and development on The Environmental Vulnerability Index, lead to a presentation of the first functional results with the Demonstration EVI.

== Calculation ==
To be able to calculate an Environmental Vulnerability Index it requires the compilation of relevant environmental vulnerability data for the 50 indicators. Once compiled then this data must be used to calculate each indicator. As the indicators are heterogeneous, include variables for which responses are numerical, qualitative and on different scales (linear, non-linear, or with different ranges) they are mapped onto a 1–7 vulnerability scale. Where data is not available, no value is given for the indicator and the denominator of the average adjusted down by one value. Where an indicator is considered 'non-applicable' in a country (such as volcanic eruptions in Tuvalu which has no volcanoes), the lowest vulnerability score of 1 is attributed to that indicator. The vulnerability scores for each indicator are then accumulated either into categories or sub-indices and the average calculated. An overall average of all indicators is calculated to generate the country EVI. The EVI is accumulated into three sub-indices: Hazards, Resistance, Damage

The 50 EVI indicators are also divided up in the issue categories for use as required: Climate change, Biodiversity, Water, Agriculture and fisheries, Human health aspects, Desertification, and Exposure to Natural Disasters.

[[Wastewater]] comes out of the [[laundry]] process with additional energy (heat), lint, soil, dyes, finishing agents, and other chemicals from detergents.&lt;ref name="steber"&gt;Steber, J., &amp; Wiebel, F. Laundry Detergents, 4. Ecology and Toxicology. ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry''. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14356007.o15_o15/full doi: 10.1002/14356007.o15_o15]&lt;/ref&gt; Some laundry wastewater goes directly into the environment, due to the flaws of water [[infrastructure]]. The majority goes to [[sewage]] treatment plants before flowing into the environment. Some chemicals remain in the water after treatment, which may contaminate the water system. They can be toxic to wildlife, or can lead to [[eutrophication]].

==General influences of laundry wastewater==
Data shows that United States has more than 35,000 laundries. On the average, a single laundry can discharge 400 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of wastewater every day.&lt;ref&gt;Ciabattia, I., Cesaro, F., Faralli, L., Fatarella, E., &amp; Tognotti, F. (2009). Demonstration of a treatment system for purification and reuse of laundry wastewater. ''Desalination'', 245(1), 451-459. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916409003580 doi:10.1016/j.desal.2009.02.008]&lt;/ref&gt; Annually, about 5.11&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; laundry wastewater is produced, which can fill 1,460 [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]]s in New Orleans.

===Treatment of laundry wastewater===
There are several parameters in the evaluation of laundry wastewater: temperature, pH-value, suspended substances, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, sediment substances, total nitrogen, total [[phosphorus]], nitrogen ammonia, chemical oxygen demand(COD), biochemical oxygen demand(BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), anionic surfactants.&lt;ref&gt;Šostar-Turk, S., Petrinić, I., &amp; Simonič, M. (2005). Laundry wastewater treatment using coagulation and membrane filtration. ''Resources, Conservation and Recycling'', 44(2), 185-196. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344904001818 doi:10.1016/j.resconrec.2004.11.002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals in detergents===
Several common [[detergent]] ingredients are [[surfactant]]s, [[builder (detergent)|builder]]s, bleach-active compounds and auxiliary agents. The surfactants can be classified into anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants. The most widely used surfactant linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonate]] (LAS) is an anionic surfactant. In builders, sodium triphosphate, zeolite A, sodium [[nitrilotriacetate]] (NTA) are the most important substances. Bleach-active compounds are usually [[sodium perborate]] and [[sodium percarbonate]]. Enzymes and fluorescent whitening agents are added into detergents as auxiliary agents.&lt;ref name="steber" /&gt;

==Mechanism==

===Environmental harm of surfactants===

Surfactants own both hydrophilic and lipophilic properties in one molecule, so they are called surface active agents, and are widely used in various washing process. With the lipophilic tails, surfactants are biologically active. Anionic surfactants have the ability of binding to bioactive macromolecules like [[enzymes]], DNA, peptides, causing changes of surface charge and the folding of polypeptide chain(structure of protein). The function of proteins will be different. Cationic surfactant can bind to the inner membrane of bacteria, and by this way disorganize the bacteria through their long alkyl chain. Nonionic surfactants are able to bind to both proteins and phospholipid membrane, leading to leakage of low molecular mass compounds by increasing the permeability of membranes and vesicles. This may result in serious damage in cells or even cell death.&lt;ref name="ivan"&gt;Ivanković, T., &amp; Hrenović, J. (2010). Surfactants in the environment. ''Arhiv za higijenu rada i toksikologiju'', 61(1), 95-109. [http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/aiht.2010.61.issue-1/10004-1254-61-2010-1943/10004-1254-61-2010-1943.xml doi: 10.2478/10004-1254-61-2010-1943]&lt;/ref&gt;

—'''LAS and its biodegradation'''

Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) with the formula of C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Na, also known as [[sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate]], is the most widely used anionic surfactant in laundry detergent because it has minimal environmental impact for its readily biodegradation.

A complete biodegradation under aerobic conditions consists of two steps, primary biodegradation and ultimate biodegradation. The first step begins from the terminal carbon in the alkyl chain as omega-oxidation, which can start from one or both ends, then is followed by beta-oxidation. After the first step the residual is sulfophenyl(di)carboxylates (SP(d)Cs), a large molecule which can be involved in the second step. The second step occurs only when the required bacteria exist. The ring cleavage of benzene and the further desulphonation of the mono- and dicarboxyilic sulphophenyl acids happen. After the two-step biodegradation, LAS is degraded into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic salts and residual biomass. During the biodegradation, several specific bacteria and oxygen are required in both omega-oxidation of the alkyl chain and the benzene ring cleaving process, so this biodegradation can only happen in '''aerobic conditions'''.&lt;ref name="bio-d" /&gt;  In anaerobic conditions in treatment process, LAS shows no change. Researchers also prove that biodegradation process is restricted in 20–40&amp;nbsp;mg/L and even inhibited at a higher concentration, which leads to the incomplete biodegradation of LAS in sewage treatment plants.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, D. A., Metcalfe, I. S., Xiong, F., &amp; Livingston, A. G. (2001). Wet air oxidation of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate 1. Effect of temperature and pressure. ''Industrial &amp; engineering chemistry research'', 40(23), 5507-5516. [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie010293k doi: 10.1021/ie010293k]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harm of builders to the environment===
Builders in detergents are water softeners, which can remove calcium and magnesium ions by complexation or precipitation in a hard water (water contains a lot of calcium and magnesium).

'''[[Sodium triphosphate]]''', with a formula of Na&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, is a largely used builder in laundry detergents, which can lead to [[eutrophication]] caused by phosphorus (P). P is needed for energy transfer, the formation of DNA, RNA and many other intermediary metabolites. Only P in orthophosphate can be assimilated by autotrophs, other P compounds like sodium triphosphate can be chemically or enzymatically hydrolyzed to orthophosphate.&lt;ref&gt;Correll, D. L. (1998). The role of phosphorus in the eutrophication of receiving waters: A review. ''Journal of Environmental Quality'', 27(2), 261-266. [https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/27/2/JEQ0270020261 doi:10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700020004x]&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism is shown below.&lt;ref name="p"&gt;McComb, R. B., Bowers, G. N., &amp; Posen, S. (1979). ''Alkaline phosphatase'' (p. 986). New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hydrolytic degradation of sodium triphosphate.jpg|framed|center|Degradation of sodium triphosphate with enzyme&lt;ref name="p" /&gt;]]

Excessive phosphorus can make for excessive production of autotrophs, like algae and cyanobacteria, leading to '''eutrophication''' in an inorganic nutrient pathway. Nutrient enrichment in lakes and reservoirs results in the microscopic floating plants, algae and formation of dense mats of larger floating plants that can produce oxygen by photosynthesis. When they die and sink to the bottom, they consume oxygen in decomposition. Bacteria thriving in this process consume oxygen. With the depletion of oxygen, fishes die and anaerobic bacteria produce [[methane]], [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[ammonia]], which can destroy the ecosystem.

==Prevention==

To reduce the eutrophication caused by sodium triphosphate, there are phosphorus-free builders substitutes nowadays, such as inorganic builders zeolite A and soda ash, and organic builders like polycarboxylates, citrates et al.

'''Ephraim Avigdor Speiser''' (January 24, 1902 &amp;ndash; June 15, 1965) was a [[Jewish]] [[Poland|Polish]]-born American [[Assyriologist]]. He discovered the ancient site of [[Tepe Gawra]] in 1927 and supervised its excavation between 1931 and 1938.

==Pre-war career==
He was born in [[Skalat]], [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], (then in Austrian Poland, now Ukraine) and went to school in [[Lwow]]. In 1920, at the age of 18, he emigrated to the United States, eventually becoming a US citizen in 1926.
He studied at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], from which he received his M.A. in 1923, before earning his Ph.D. from [[Dropsie College]] in Philadelphia in 1924.&lt;ref name=upenn&gt;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/faids/upt/upt50/speiser_ea.html University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center]&lt;/ref&gt; 
From 1924 to 1926 he was Harrison Research Fellow in Semitics at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=cdli&gt;[http://cdliwiki.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/doku.php/speiser_ephraim_avigdor Speiser, Ephraim Avigdor]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, UCLA Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Speiser won a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to study remains of the ancient [[Mitanni]] and [[Hurrians]] in northern [[Mesopotamia]]. While there in 1927 he discovered the [[Tepe Gawra]] (or "Great Mound"), one of the world's earliest cradles of civilization. In 1928 he was appointed assistant professor of Semitics at the University of Pennsylvania, and full professor in 1931.
He was field director of the Joint Excavation of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research|ASOR]] and the University Museum, 1930–1932, 1936–1937, undertaking excavations in [[Tepe Gawra]] and Tell Billa.  He also translated the [[Hurrian]] legal texts found at [[Nuzi]].

During [[World War II]], Speiser left academia to become chief of the [[Office of Strategic Services]]' Near East Section of the Research and Analysis Branch in Washington. He established a long tradition of American students and scholars of Orientalistik entering and serving in the intelligence services.

==Post-war==
After the war he returned to the University of Pennsylvania, where he was Chairman of the Department of Oriental Studies from 1947 until his death in 1965. He was also appointed Ellis Professor of Hebrew and Semitic Languages and Literatures there in 1954.

He translated and wrote extensive commentary for the volume on [[Genesis (Old Testament)|Genesis]] in the [[Anchor Bible Series]] and was one of the editors of the [[Torah]] in the [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version]] of the [[Old Testament]].

A noted student of his, (future professor) [[Moshe Greenberg]], became an [[Israel Prize]] laureate in Bible studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4830">The '''European environmental research and innovation policy''' is a set of strategies, actions and programmes to promote more and better research and innovation for building a [[resource-efficient]] and [[climate]] resilient society and economy in sync with the [[natural environment]]. It is based on the [[Europe 2020]] strategy for a smart, [[sustainable]] and inclusive economy and it realises the [[European Research Area]] (ERA) and Innovation Union in the field of environment.
The aim of the European environmental research and innovation policy is to contribute to a transformative agenda for Europe in the coming years, where the quality of life of the citizens and the environment are steadily improved, in sync with the competitiveness of businesses, the societal inclusion and the management of resources.

==Main features==

The '''European environmental research and innovation policy''' has a multidisciplinary character and involve efforts across many different sectors to provide safe, economically feasible, environmentally sound and socially acceptable solutions along the entire [[value chain]] of human activities. To reduce resource use and [[environmental impacts]] whilst increasing competitiveness requires a decisive societal and technological transition to an economy based on a sustainable relationship between nature and human well-being. The availability of sufficient [[raw materials]] is addressed as well as the creation of opportunities for growth and new jobs. Innovative options are developed in policies ranging across science, technology, economy, regulations, society and citizens’ behavior, and governance. Research and innovation activities improve the understanding and forecasting of climate and environmental change in a systemic and cross-sectoral perspective, reduce uncertainties, identify and assess vulnerabilities, risks, costs, mitigation measures and opportunities, as well as expand the range and improve the effectiveness of societal and policy responses and solutions.

==International context==

{{See also|Sustainable development|Sustainable Development Goals }}
The European environmental research and innovation policy was placed in the context of the process at the [[United Nations]] to develop a set of [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) that were agreed at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20 Conference]] on [[Sustainable development]] in 2012 and are now integrated into the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015. These goals have succeeded the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and are universally applicable to all Nations, hence also to the [[European Union]] and its Member States.

==Implementation through Framework Programmes==

{{See also|Horizon 2020}}
The implementation of the European environmental research and innovation policy relies on a systemic approach to innovation for a system-wide transformation. For large extent, it is carried out through the Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development.

The current Framework Programme is called [[Horizon 2020]] and environmental research and innovation is envisaged across the entire programme with an interdisciplinary approach. Current price estimates suggest that more than 6,5 € billion per year could be made available for activities related to sustainable development during the duration of Horizon 2020, addressing both research and innovation differently from previous FPs.&lt;ref&gt;It is expected that at least 60% of the overall Horizon 2020 budget should be related to sustainable development, and that climate-related expenditure should exceed 35% of the budget [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm "Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme"], ''[[European Commission]]'', Brussels, 3 December 2013. Retrieved on 18 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Horizon 2020 is open to cooperation with researchers and innovators world-wide in order to foster co-design and co-creation of solutions that may have a global impact.

New calls for research and innovation proposals have been opened on 14 October 2015. Information is contained in the Horizon 2020 participant portal.

'''Browning''' is the process of food turning brown due to the chemical reactions that take place within. The process of browning is one of the chemical reactions that take place in food chemistry and represents an  interesting research topic regarding health, nutrition, and food technology. Though there are many different ways food chemically changes over time, browning in particular falls into 2 main categories.

Browning has many important implications on the food industry relating to nutrition, technology, and economic  cost.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118308035.ch4/summary|title=Food Biochemistry and Food Processing|last=Corzo-Martínez|first=Marta|last2=Corzo|first2=Nieves|last3=Villamiel|first3=Mar|last4=del Castillo|first4=M Dolores|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781118308035|editor-last=Ph.D|editor-first=Benjamin K. Simpson|pages=56– 83|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118308035.ch4/summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are especially interested in studying the control (inhibition) of browning and the different methods that can be employed to maximize this inhibition and ultimately prolong the shelf life of food.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaanane|first=A.|last2=Labuza|first2=T.

== Enzymatic browning ==
Enzymatic browning is one of the most important reactions that takes place in most fruits and vegetables as well as in seafood.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/45/8/1150.full.pdf|title=Enzymatic Browning, Polyphenol Oxidase Activity, and Polyphenols in Four Apple Cultivars: Dynamics during Fruit Development|last=Holderbaum,|first=Daniel|date=2010|website=|publisher=HortScience|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes affect the taste, color, and value of such foods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Generally, it is a chemical reaction involving [[polyphenol oxidase]], [[catechol oxidase]], and other [[enzyme]]s that create [[melanin]]s and [[benzoquinone]] from [[natural phenol]]s. Enzymatic browning (also called oxidation of foods) requires exposure to [[oxygen]]. It begins with the oxidation of [[phenols]] by [[polyphenol oxidase]] into [[quinone]]s,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macheix|first=J. J.|last2=Sapis|first2=J. C.|last3=Fleuriet|first3=A.|date=1991-01-01|title=Phenolic compounds and polyphenoloxidase in relation to browning in grapes and wines|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume=30|issue=4|pages=441–486|doi=10.1080/10408399109527552|issn=1040-8398|pmid=1910524}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose strong electrophilic state causes high susceptibility to a nucleophilic attack from other proteins.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These quinones are then polymerized in a series of reactions, eventually resulting in the formation of brown pigments (melanosis) on the surface of the food.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicolas|first=J.

Examples of non-beneficial enzymatic browning:

* Fresh fruit and vegetables, including [[apple]]s, [[potato]]es, [[banana]]s and [[avocado]]s.
* Polyphenols oxidases is the major reaction in the formation of [[Melanosis]] in crustaceans such as shrimp.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nirmal|first=Nilesh Prakash|last2=Benjakul|first2=Soottawat|last3=Ahmad|first3=Mehraj|last4=Arfat|first4=Yasir Ali|last5=Panichayupakaranant|first5=Pharkphoom|date=2015-01-01|title=Undesirable Enzymatic Browning in Crustaceans: Causative Effects and Its Inhibition by Phenolic Compounds|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume=55|issue=14|pages=1992–2003|doi=10.1080/10408398.2012.755148|issn=1549-7852|pmid=25584522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Control of enzymatic browning ==
A variety of methods are used to prevent or slow down enzymatic browning of foods, each method aimed at targeting specific steps of the chemical reaction. The control of enzymatic browning has always been a challenge for the food industry. In addition, the use of chemicals to inhibit browning, such as sulfite (a powerful antibrowning chemical) have been reconsidered due to the potential hazards{{clarify|date=February 2017}} it causes along with its activity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Much research has been conducted regarding the exact types of control mechanisms that take place when confronted with these enzymatic process. The different types of enzymatic browning control can be classified different groups.
* [[Lemon]] juice and other [[acid]]s lower the [[pH]] and remove the copper [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] necessary for the responsible enzymes to function
* [[Blanching (cooking)|Blanching]] or roasting of foods, to [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] the enzymes, and destroy to responsible [[reactants]], as used in the "kill green" phase of [[tea processing]].
* Low temperatures can also prevent enzymatic browning by reducing [[rate of reaction]].
* Use of [[ascorbic acid]] in certain pH's to control browning of apples under certain conditions by changing their phenolase activity. Different pH values affect phenolase activity of apples differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=el-Shimi|first=N. M.|date=1993-01-01|title=Control of enzymatic browning in apple slices by using ascorbic acid under different conditions|journal=Plant Foods for Human Nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)|volume=43|issue=1|pages=71–76|issn=0921-9668|pmid=8464847}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Proteins can exert an inhibitory effect on PPO activity by [[Chelation|Chelating]] the essential copper at the active site of PPO  through competitive inhibition, inhibiting its activity  &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* During wine synthesis, the use of [[Ion-exchange chromatography|Ion-exchange filtration]] is used to remove the brown color sediments in the solution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* [[Arctic Apples]] have been genetically modified to avoid expressing [[polyphenol oxidase]] and thus do not brown

== Non-enzymatic browning ==
[[File:Brioche.jpg|thumb|left|The crust of [[brioche]] bread, which is golden-brown due to the Maillard reaction|225x225px]]
The second type of browning, nonenzymatic browning, is a process that also produces the brown pigmentation in foods, but without the activity of enzymes. The two main forms of non-enzymatic browning are [[caramelization]] and the [[Maillard reaction]]. Both vary in the reaction rate as a function of [[water activity]] (in food chemistry, the standard state of water activity is most often defined as the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature.

[[Caramelization]] is a process involving the [[pyrolysis]] of [[sugar]]. It is used extensively in cooking for the desired nutty flavor and brown color. As the process occurs, [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] chemicals are released, producing the characteristic [[caramel]] flavor.

[[File:Caramelization (2).png|thumb|308x308px|Example caramelization of table sugar (sucrose) caramelizing to a brown nutty flavor substance (furan and maltol)]][[File:Maillard reaction asparagin.png|thumb|275x275px|Overview of the mechanism of non-enzymatic Maillard reaction in foods. The schiff base loses a CO2 molecule and adds to water. Notice the interaction between the amine group of the amino acid (asparagine here) and the carbonyl carbon of the sugar, (Glucose). The end product is [[acrylamide]]. For more information, visit [[Maillard reaction]]. ]]

The other non-enzymatic reaction is the [[Maillard reaction]]. This reaction is responsible for the production of the flavor when foods are cooked. Examples of foods that undergo Maillard reaction include breads, steaks, and potatoes. It is a chemical reaction that takes place between the [[amine group]] of a free [[amino acid]] and the [[carbonyl group]] of a [[reducing sugar]],&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; usually with the addition of heat. The sugar interacts with the amino acid, producing a variety of odors and flavors. The Maillard reaction is the basis for producing artificial flavors for processed foods in the flavoring industry,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijfs/2015/526762/|title=Food Processing and Maillard Reaction Products: Effect on Human Health and Nutrition|last=Tamanna|first=Nahid|date=2015|website=|publisher=Hindawa|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the type of amino acid involved determines the resulting flavor.

[[Melanoidin]]s are brown, high molecular weight heterogeneous polymers that are formed when sugars and amino acids combine through the Maillard reaction at high temperatures and low water activity. Melanoidins are commonly present in foods that have undergone some form of non-enzymatic browning, such as barley malts (Vienna and Munich), bread crust, bakery products and coffee. They are also present in the wastewater of sugar refineries, necessitating treatment in order to avoid contamination around the outflow of these refineries.

== Browning of grapes during winemaking ==
Like most fruit, grapes vary in the amount of phenolic compounds they have. This characteristic is used as a parameter in judging the quality of wine.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The general process of winemaking is initiated by the enzymatic oxidation of phenolic compounds by polyphenol oxidases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Contact between the phenolic compounds in the [[Vacuole]] of the grape cell and the [[Polyphenol oxidase]] [[Enzyme]] (located in the cytoplasm) triggers the oxidation of the grape. Thus, the initial browning of grapes occurs as a result of "compartmentalization modification" in the cells of the grape.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Aged white wine with brown color.jpg|thumb|Aged [[white wine]] with brown color|216x216px]]

== Implications in food industry and technology ==
Enzymatic browning affects the color, flavor, and nutritional value of foods, causing huge economic loss when not sold to consumers on time.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It is estimated that more than 50% of produce is lost as a result of enzymatic browning.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The increase in human population and consequential depletion in our natural resources has prompted many biochemists and [[Food engineering|Food engineers]] alike to find new and improved techniques to preserve food longer, by using methods to inhibit the browning reaction, and effectively increase the shelf life of foods. A better understanding of the enzymatic browning mechanisms, specifically, understanding the properties of the enzymes and substrates that are involved in the reaction, may help food technologists to control certain stages in the mechanism and inhibit browning.

Apples are fruits commonly studied by researchers due to their high phenolic content, which make them highly susceptible to enzymatic browning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In accordance with other findings regarding apples and browning activity, a correlation has been found between high phenolic amount and enzymatic activity of apples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This provides a hope for food industries in an effort to genetically modify foods to decrease polyphenol oxidase activity and thus decrease browning. An example of such accomplishments in food engineering is in the production of [[Arctic Apples]]. These apples, engineered by ''Okanagan Specialty Fruits Inc,'' are a result of [[gene splicing]], a technique that has allowed for the reduction in polyphenol oxidase.

Another type of issue that is closely studied is the browning of seafood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Seafood]], in particular shrimp, is a delicacy consumed by people all over the world. The browning of shrimp which is actually referred to as [[Melanosis]], creates a great concern for food handlers and consumers. Melanosis mainly occurs during postmortem handling and refrigerated storage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Recent studies have found a plant extract that acts as an anti melatonin polyphenol oxidase inhibitor and serves the same function as sulfites but without the health risks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point''', abbreviated '''GSSP''', is an internationally agreed upon reference point on a [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] section which defines the lower boundary of a [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] on the [[geologic time scale]].  The effort to define GSSPs is conducted by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]], a part of the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]].  Most, but not all, GSSPs are based on [[paleontology|paleontological]] changes.  Hence GSSPs are usually described in terms of transitions between different [[faunal stage]]s, though far more faunal stages have been described than GSSPs.  The GSSP definition effort commenced in 1977.  As of 2012, 64 of the 101 stages that need a GSSP have been formally defined.&lt;ref name="International Chronostratigraphic Chart 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart 2012|url=http://stratigraphy.org/column.php?id=Chart/Time%20Scale|publisher=ICS|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
A geologic section has to fulfill a set of criteria to be adapted as a GSSP by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]]. The following list summarizes the criteria:&lt;ref name="Remane 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Remane|first=J.|author2=M. G. Bassett |author3=J. W. Cowie |author4=K.H. Gohrbandt |author5=H.R. Lane |author6=O. Michelsen |author7=Wang Naiwen |title=Guidelines for the establishment of global chronostratigraphic standards by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)|journal=Episodes|date=1996|volume=19|pages=77–81|url=http://work.geobiology.cn/ebook/%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E6%9C%9F%E5%88%8A/Permophiles%20NO.29/19%20Guidelines%20for%20the%20establishment%20of%20global%20chronostratigraphic%20standards%20by%20the%20International%20Commission%20on%20Stratigraphy%20(ICS)%20(Revised).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GSSP Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=GSSP Rules|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/Stratigraphy/gssp/gssp_r.html|publisher=Geologic Timescale Foundation|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A GSSP has to define the lower boundary of a geologic [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stage]].
* The lower boundary has to be defined using a primary marker (usually [[first appearance datum]] of a fossil species).
** There should also be secondary markers (other fossils, [[Chemostratigraphy|chemical]], [[geomagnetic reversal]]).
** The horizon in which the marker appears should have minerals that can be [[Radiometric dating|radiometrically dated]].
** The marker has to have regional and global correlation in outcrops of the same age
** The marker should be independent of [[facies]].
* The outcrop has to have an adequate thickness
* Sedimentation has to be continuous without any changes in facies
* The outcrop should be unaffected by tectonic and sedimentary movements, and metamorphism
* The outcrop has to be accessible to research and free to access.
** This includes that the outcrop has to be located where it can be visited quickly (International airport and good roads), has to be kept in good condition (Ideally a national reserve), in accessible terrain, extensive enough to allow repeated sampling and open to researchers of all nationalities.

The [[Precambrian]]-[[Cambrian]] boundary GSSP at [[Fortune Head]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] is a typical GSSP.  It is accessible by paved road and is set aside as a [[nature preserve]].  A continuous section is available from beds that are clearly Precambrian into beds that are clearly Cambrian.  The boundary is set at the first appearance of a complex trace fossil ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' that is found worldwide.  The Fortune Head GSSP is unlikely to be washed away or built over. Nonetheless, ''Treptichnus pedum'' is less than ideal as a marker fossil as it is not found in every Cambrian sequence, and it is not assured that it is found at the same level in every exposure. In fact, further eroding its value as a boundary marker, it has since been identified in strata 4m ''below'' the GSSP!&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author =    | first = J.| first2 = S.

However, no other fossil is known that would be preferable.  There is no [[radiometric dating|radiometrically datable]] bed at the boundary at Fortune Head, but there is one slightly above the boundary in similar beds nearby.
These factors have led some geologists{{who|date=March 2016}} to suggest that this GSSP is in need of reassigning.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Once a GSSP boundary has been agreed upon, a "golden spike" is driven into the geologic section to mark the precise boundary for future geologists (though in practice the "spike" need neither be golden nor an actual spike).  The first stratigraphic boundary was defined in 1977 by identifying the [[Silurian]]-[[Devonian]] boundary with a bronze plaque at a locality called [[Klonk]], northeast of the village of Suchomasty in the [[Czech Republic]].  GSSPs are also sometimes referred to as '''Golden Spikes'''.

==Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages==
{{main article|Global Standard Stratigraphic Age}}
Because defining a GSSP depends on finding well-preserved geologic sections and identifying key events, this task becomes more difficult as one goes farther back in time.  Before 630 million years ago, boundaries on the geologic timescale are defined simply by reference to fixed dates, known as "Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages".

{{Inca civilization}}

==Hydraulic engineering==
{{See also|Incan aqueducts}}

The builders of the empire planned and built impressive waterworks in their city centers, including [[canal]]s, [[fountain]]s, [[drainage]] systems and expansive [[irrigation]]. Inca's infrastructure and [[water supply]] system have been hailed as “the pinnacle of the architectural and engineering works of the Inca civilization”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kenneth R. Wright |author2=Jonathan M. Kelly |author3=Alfredo Valencia Zegarra. | title=Machu Picchu: Ancient Hydraulic Engineering  | journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering | year=1997| volume=123 | issue=10 | pages= 838–843 | doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1997)123:10(838)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major Inca centers were chosen by experts who decided the site, its apportionment, and the basic layout of the city. In many cities we see great hydraulic engineering marvels. For example, in the city of [[Tipón|Tipon]], 3 irrigation canals diverted water from Rio [[Pukara]] to [[Tipón|Tipon]] which is about 1.35&amp;nbsp;km north for Tipon's terraces.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Water Technologies|last=Mays|first=Larry|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-9048186310|location=New York|pages=188–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tipón|Tipon]] also had natural springs that they built fountains for that supplied noble residents with water for non agricultural purposes.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==Machu Picchu==
In 1450, [[Machu Picchu]] was constructed.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.machupicchu.org/how_old_is_machu_picchu.htm|title=How Old is Machu Picchu|last=|first=|date=|website=Peru for Less|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This date was determined and based off the [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon 14 test]] results.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The famous lost Inca city is an architectural remnant of a society whose understanding of civil and [[hydraulic engineering]] was advanced. Today, it is famously known for its remarkable preservation as well as the beauty of the building's architecture.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The site is located 120&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Cuzco in the Urubamba river valley, Peru.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;At  2560 m above sea level, sitting atop a mountain, the city planners had to consider the steep slopes of the site as well as the humid and rainy climate.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;  The Inca people built this site atop a hill which was terraced (most likely for agricultural purposes).&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;  In addition to terraces, Machu Picchu is composed of two additional basic architectural elements; elite residential compounds and religious structures.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The site is full of staircases and sculpted rock, which were also important to their architecture and engineering practices.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;
[[File:99 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009.edit3.jpg|thumb|An example of Machu Picchu]]
Making models out of clay before beginning to build, the city planners remained consistent with Inca architecture and laid out a city that separated the agriculture and urban areas.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Before construction began the engineers had to assess the spring and whether it could provide for all of the city’s anticipated citizens.  After evaluating the water supply, the civil engineers designed a {{convert|2457|ft|m|adj=on}}-long [[canal]] to what would become the city’s center. The canal descends the mountain slope, enters the city walls, passes through the agricultural sector, then crosses the inner wall into the urban sector, where it feeds a series of fountains. The fountains are publicly accessible and partially enclosed by walls that are typically about 1.2 m high, except for the lowest fountain, which is a private fountain for the Temple of the Condor and has higher walls. At the head of each fountain, a cut stone conduit carries the water to a rectangular spout, which is shaped to create a jet of water suitable for filling aryballo–a typical Inca clay water jug. The water collects in a stone basin in the floor of the fountain, then enters a circular drain that delivers it to the approach channel for the next fountain.

The Incas built the canals on steady grades, using cut stones as the water channels.  Most citizens worked on the construction and maintenance of the canal and irrigation systems, bronze and [[stone tool|stone]] tools to complete the water-tight stone canals. The water then traveled through the channels into sixteen [[fountain]]s known as the "stairway of fountains", reserving the first water source for the [[emperor]].  This incredible feat supplied the population of Machu Picchu, which varied between 300 and 1000 people when the emperor was present, and also helped irrigate water to the farming steppes. The fountains and canal system were built so well that they would, after a few minor repairs, still work today.

To go along with the Incas' advanced water supply system, an equally impressive drainage system was built as well.  Machu Picchu contains nearly 130 outlets in the center that moved the water out of the city through walls and other structures.  The agriculture [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] are a feature of the complicated drainage system; the [[steppe]]s helped avoid erosion, and were built on a slope to aimed excess water into channels that ran alongside the stairways.  These channels carried the runoff into the main drain, avoiding the main water supply.  This carefully planned drainage system shows the Incas' concern and appreciation for clean water.  Water engineer Ken Wright and his archaeological team found the emperor’s [[bathing room]] complete with a separate [[Drain (plumbing)|drain]] that carried off his used bath water so it would never re-enter Machu Picchu’s water supply.

== Terraces ==

=== Terrace Function and Structure ===
The Inca faced many problems with living in areas with steep terrain. Two large issues were soil [[erosion]] and area to grow crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/terrace-cultivation|title=Terrace cultivation|website=britannica.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The solution to these problems were the development of terraces, called [[Anden]]es. These terraces allowed the Inca to utilize land for farming that they never could in the past.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Londoño|first=Ana|date=February 12, 2007|title=Pattern and rate of erosion inferred from Inca agricultural terraces in arid southern Peru|journal=Geomorphology|volume=99|pages=13|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2007.09.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everything&amp;nbsp;about how the terrace function, looks, its geometric alignment, etc. all depend on the slope of the land.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  The different layering of materials is part of what makes the terraces so successful. It starts with a base layer of large rocks. Followed by a second layer is smaller rocks. Then a layer of sand like material, and finally the top soil. You can practice this in a simulation [http://nmai.si.edu/inkaroad/engineering/activity/engineer-inka-terrace.html here].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nmai.si.edu/inkaroad/engineering/activity/engineer-inka-terrace.html|title=Engineering the Inka empire|last=|first=|date=|website=Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most impressive part of the terraces were their drainage systems. &amp;nbsp;Drain outlets placed in the numerous stone retaining walls.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright, Valencia, Lorah|first=Kenneth, Alfedo, William|date=|title=Ancient Machu Picchu Drainage Engineering|url=http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/machupicchu/machupicchu.pdf|journal=Waterhistory.org|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger rocks at base of each terrace level is what allowed the water to flow easier through the larger spaces in between the rocks eventually coming out at the “Main Drain”.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Inca even constructed different types of drainage channels that are used for different purposes throughout the city. &amp;nbsp;

=== How They Were Built and Why They Were Effective.  ===
Studies have indicated that when terraces like the ones in the Colca Valley were being constricted the first step was excavating  into the slope and the a subsequent infilling of the slope.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; A retaining wall was built to hold the fill material.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This wall had many uses including absorbing heat from the sun during the day and radiated it back out at night, often keeping crops from freezing in the chilling nighttime temperatures and holding back the different layers of sediment. After the wall is built the larger rocks would be placed on the bottom, then smaller rocks, then sand, then soil.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Since the soil was now level, the water did not rush down the side of the mountain which is what causes erosion. Previously, this erosion was so powerful that it had potential to wipe out major areas of the Inca road as well as and wash away all of the nutrients and fertile soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nmai.si.edu/inkaroad/engineering/question/how-did-inka-control-erosion-and-grow-crops-steep-andes-terrain.html|title=How did the Inca control erosion and grow crops|last=|first=|date=June 26, 2010|website=Engineering the Inca empire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the soil never washed away, nutrients would always be added from previously grown crops year after year.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The Inca even grew specific crops together to balance out the optimal amount of nutrients for all plants. For example,  a planting method known as "three sisters" incorporated the growth of corn, beans and squash in the same terrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/inventions/5-ancient-incan-inventions4.htm|title=Terrace Farming|last=Franco|first=Michael|date=|website=HowStuffWorks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because the fixed nitrogen in the beans helped the corn grow while the squash acted as mulch keeping the soil moist and also acted as a weed repellant.

== Freeze -Drying ==

=== What to Freeze Dry and why? ===
A very common and well known Freeze dried item was the potato or when it was frozen, [[Chuño]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All food grown or killed by the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] could be [[Freeze-drying|freeze dried]]. Freeze drying is still very popular today. One of the biggest benefits for freeze drying is that it takes out all of the water and [[moisture]] but leaves all of the nutritious value.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inside-peru.com/inca-food.html|title=Inca Food and the Inca People|last=Unknown|first=|date=Not stated|website=inside peru.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water in meats and vegetables is what gives them a lot of their weight. This is what made it very popular for transportation purposes and storage because dried meats lasted twice as long as non freeze dried foods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Vegetables- Potato

Inca diet was largely [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] because large wild game were often reserved for special occasions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Meats- Llama, Alpaca, duck, guinea-pig&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Transportation and storage of [[jerky]] Or 'charki' (the Inca name) was much easier to transport and lasted longer than not dried meats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These all had potential to be freeze dried.

==== How to Freeze dry ====
[[File:Chuño.jpg|thumb|Chuño]]
Both meats and vegetables went through a similar freezing process. They would start by laying all the different foods on rocks and during the cold nights in high [[altitude]]s with dry air they would freeze.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The next morning, a combination of the thin dry air and the heat from the sun would melt the ice and [[Evaporation|evaporate]] all the [[moisture]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The most important factor about this process and what made the Inca able to do this is the dry and [[google:rarefied&amp;oq=rarefied&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1614j1j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8|rarefied]] atmosphere that they live in. A few different methods can be used for the last step which is take out the last of the moisture. The over arching idea is to compress the food to a point where it would expel the rest of its moisture.

The process of Freeze Drying was important for transportation and storage.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In the high elevation of the [[Andes|Andes Montanan's]] the low temperatures is a huge factor of what allowed them to take advantage of this process.

== Pathway Systems ==
The vast size of the [[Inca Empire|Inca empire]] made it essential that efficient and effective transportation systems were created and built to assist in the exchanging of goods, services, people, etc. At one point, "their&amp;nbsp;(the [[Inca Empire|Inca) empire]] eventually extended across western South America from Quito in the north to Santiago in the south, making it the largest empire ever seen in the Americas and the largest in the world at that time (between c. 1400 and 1533 CE)."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Inca_Civilization/|title=Inca Civilization|last=Cartwright|first=Mark|date=September 15, 2014|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known to have "extended some 3500-4000 km along the mountainous backbone of South America."&lt;ref name="springer"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link-springer-com.muhlenberg.idm.oclc.org/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4615-0521-1_14.pdf|title=Encyclopedia of Prehistory: Volume 7: South America|last=Peregrine|first=Peter|last2=Ember|first2=Melvin|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=150–193|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gridclub.com/subscribers/info/fact_gadget_2009/best_ever_qa/history/early_america/1678.html|title=Grid Club|last=powered by Google|first=|date=|website=Fact Gadget|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trails, roads, and bridges were designed not only to link the empire physically, but these structures also helped the empire to maintain communication.

=== &lt;u&gt;Rope Bridges&lt;/u&gt; ===
[[File:Inca bridge.jpg|thumb|An example of an Inca rope bridge]]
[[Inca rope bridge|Rope bridges]] were an integral part of the [[Inca road system]]. "Five centuries ago, the [[Andes]] were strung with [[Inca rope bridge|suspension bridges]]. By some estimates there were as many as 200 of them."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2013/06/10/the_last_incan_suspension_bridge_is_made_entirely_of_grass_and_woven_by.html|title=The Last Incan Suspension Bridge Is Made Entirely of Grass and Woven by Hand|last=Obscura|first=Atlas|date=June 10, 2013|website=Slate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/science/08bridg.html|title=How the Inca Leapt Canyons|last=Wilford|first=John|date=May 8, 2007|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As pictured to the right, these structures were used to connect two land masses, allowing for the flow of ideas, goods, people, animals, etc. across the [[Inca Empire|Incan empire]]. "The [[Inca rope bridge|Inca suspension bridges]] achieved clear spans of at least 150 feet, probably much greater.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/education/ancient/grass-bridge.html|title=Grass Bridge|last=|first=|date=May 9, 2006|website=PBS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a longer span than any European masonry bridges at the time."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since the Incan people did not use wheeled vehicles, most traveled by foot and/or used animals to help in the transporting of goods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== ''Construction'' ====
Although these [[Inca Bridge|bridges]] were assembled using twisted mountain grass, other vegetation, and saplings, they were dependable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These structures were able to both support the weight of traveling people and animals as well as withstand weather conditions over certain amounts of time. Since grass rots away over time, the bridges had to be rebuilt every year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
[[File:2015 Smithsonian folklife festival DC -Qeswachaka Bridge rope making - 01.jpg|thumb|280x280px|Pictured is the weaving of grass into rope to be used in the formation of a bridge]]
When the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] people began building a [[Inca Bridge|grass suspension bridge]], they would first gather natural materials of grass and other vegetation. They would then braid these elements together into rope. This contribution was made by the Inca women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh5mYw3PNhs|title=Inca Bridge|last=|first=|date=August 4, 2011|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vast amounts of thin-looking rope were produced.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The villagers would then deliver their quota of rope to the builders.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The rope was then divided into sections.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Each section consisted of an amount of thin rope being laid out together in preparation to create a thicker rope cord.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Once the sections are laid out, the strands of rope made earlier are twisted together tightly and evenly, producing the larger and thicker rope cord.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These larger ropes are then braided together to create cables, some as thick as a human torso.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Depending on the dimensions of the cable, each could weigh up to 200 pounds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These cables were then delivered to the bridge site.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

It was considered bad luck for women to be anywhere near the construction of the bridge, so the Inca men were therefore in charge of the on-site construction.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At the bridge site, a builder(s) would travel to the opposite land mass that they were working to connect.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Once they were positioned on the opposite side, one of the thin, light-weight ropes would be thrown over to them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This rope would then be used to pull the main cables over the gorge.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Stone beams were built on either side of the gorge and were used in helping to position and secure the cables.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The cables were wrapped around these stone beams and tightened inch by inch to decrease any slack in the bridge.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Once this was finished, the riggers carefully made their way across the hanging cables, tying the foot-ropes together and connecting the handrails and the foot-ropes with the remainder of the thin grass ropes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Not all rope bridges were exactly alike in terms of design and build. Some riggers also wove pieces of wood into the foot-ropes.

Modern day rope bridge builders in Huinchiri, Peru make offerings to Pacha Mama, otherwise known as "Mother Earth," throughout their building process to ensure that the bridge will be strong and safe.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2404inca.html|title=SECRETS OF LOST EMPIRES: INCA|last=|first=|date=February 11, 1997|website=PBS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been a practice used by the Inca people since they too were religious. If all went smoothly and if tasks were performed in a timely fashion, a bridge had the potential of being constructed in three days.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== ''Modern Rope Bridges'' ====
[[File:IRB-7-MUDDY2.jpg|thumb|280x280px|An example of a rope bridge]]
People today continue to honor Incan traditions and expand their knowledge in the building of [[Inca rope bridge|rope bridges]].

1."Each June in&amp;nbsp;Huinchiri, Peru,&amp;nbsp;four&amp;nbsp;[[Quechua people|Quechua]] communities on two sides of a gorge&amp;nbsp;join together to build a bridge out of grass, creating a form of ancient infrastructure&amp;nbsp;that dates back at least five centuries to the&amp;nbsp;[[Inca Empire]]."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/281699/the-inca-rope-bridge-thats-woven-across-a-river-each-year/|title=The Inca Rope Bridge That’s Woven Across a River Each Year|last=Meier|first=Allison|date=March 31, 2016|website=Hyperallergic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Q’eswachaka Bridge is cut down and swept away by the [[Apurímac River]] current and a new bridge is built in its place.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://festival.si.edu/2015/peru/traditional-knowledge/qeswachaka-bridge/smithsonian|title=Q’ESWACHAKA BRIDGE|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Smithsonian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition links the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] communities of the Huinchiri, Chaupibanda, Choccayhua, and Ccollana Quehue to their past ancestors.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;''“According to our grandfathers, this bridge was built during the time of the Inkas 600 years ago, and on it they walked their [[llama]]s and [[alpaca]]s carrying their produce.”'' ''-'' Eleuterio Ccallo Tapia&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;2. "A small portion of a 60-foot replica built by [[Quechua people|Quechua]] weavers is on view in&amp;nbsp;''The Great Inka Road: Engineering an Empire&amp;nbsp;''at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum|Smithsonian’s&amp;nbsp;National Museum]] of the American Indian in Washington, DC."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This exhibit will be on display at the museum through June 1, 2020.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/blogs/national-museum-american-indian/2017/08/05/qeswachaka-last-inka-suspension-bridge/|title=Q’eswachaka, the Last Inka Suspension Bridge|last=Plata|first=Allie|date=August 4, 2017|website=Smithsonian.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors are also encouraged to experience this exhibit online.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Either way, museums like the Smithsonian are working to preserve and display examples and knowledge of the Inca inspired [[Inca rope bridge|rope bridges]] today.

3. &amp;nbsp;John Wilford shares in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' that students at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] are learning much more than how objects are made. They are being taught to observe and test how archeology entwines with culture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Wilford's article was written in 2007.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At this time, students involved in a course called “materials in human experience,” were busy making a 60-foot-long fiber bridge in the Peruvian style.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Through this project, they were introduced to the Inca people's way of thinking and building.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After creating their ropes and cables, they had planned to stretch the bridge across a dry basin between two campus buildings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== &lt;u&gt;Roads&lt;/u&gt; ===
[[File:Inca trail, Peru.jpg|thumb|This trail was originally constructed by the Inca in Peru. It is now part of the&amp;nbsp;Inca trail to Machu Picchu.]]
[[File:Camino-inca-dia4-c06.jpg|thumb|An example of the Inca trail&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;[[Cusco]]&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;[[Machu Picchu]]&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;[[Perú]].]]
According to author Mark Cartwright, "[[Inca road system|Inca roads]] covered over 40,000 km (25,000 miles), principally in two main highways running north to south across the [[Inca Empire]], which eventually spread over ancient Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Several sources challenge Cartwright's claim in stating that the Inca roads covered either more or less area then he describes. This number is difficult to solidify since some of the pathways of the Inca still may remain unaccounted for, being that they may have been washed away or covered by natural forces. "Inca engineers were also undaunted by geographical difficulties and built roads across ravines, rivers, deserts, and mountain passes up to 5,000 metres high."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of the constructed roads are not uniform in design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most of the uncovered roads are about one to four meters wide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although this is true, some roads, such as the highway in [[Huánuco Pampa|Huanuco Pampa]] province, can be much larger in size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As mentioned in the "Pathway Systems" section, the Inca people mainly traveled on foot. Knowing this, the roads created were most likely built and paved for both humans and animals to walk and/or run along. Several roads were paved with stones or cobbles and some were "edged and protected with the use of small stone walls, stone markers, wooden or cane posts, or piles of stones."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Drainage was something that was of particular interest and importance to the Inca people. Drains and culverts were built to ensure that rainwater would effectively run off of the road's surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The drains and culverts helped in directing the accumulating water either along or under the road.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== ''Uses'' ====
1. As mentioned above under the section "Pathway Systems," there were several uses for the [[Inca road system|Inca roads]]. The most obvious way in which the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] people used the road/trail systems were to transport goods. They did this on foot and sometimes with the help of animals (llamas and alpacas).

2. Not only were goods transported throughout the vast [[Inca Empire|empire]], but so were ideas and messages. The Inca needed a system of communication, so they relied on [[Chasqui]]s, otherwise known as messengers.&lt;ref name=":13x"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discover-peru.org/inca-roads-chasqui/|title=Inca Roads and Chasquis|last=|first=|date=|website=Discover Peru|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chasqui]]s were chosen among the strongest and fittest young males.&lt;ref name=":13x" /&gt; They ran several miles per day, only to deliver messages.&lt;ref name=":13x" /&gt; These messengers resided in cabins called "[[Tambo (Incan structure)|tambos]]."&lt;ref name=":13x" /&gt; These structures were positioned along the roads and built by the Inca people.&lt;ref name=":13x" /&gt; These buildings provided the [[Chasqui]]s with a place to rest.&lt;ref name=":13x" /&gt; These places of rest could also be used to house the Inca army in a situation of rebellion or war.&lt;ref name=":13x" /&gt;

==== ''Modern Inca Roads'' ====
Today, many travel to South America to hike the Inca trail.&lt;ref name=":14x"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perutreks.com/inca_trail_to_machu_picchu.html|title=Inca Trail to Machu Picchu|last=|first=|date=|website=Peru Treks &amp; Adventure|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walking and climbing the trail not only serves the purpose of allowing visitors to expirience the historic pathways of the Inca people, but it allows for tourists and locals to see the Inca ruins, mountains, and exotic vegetation and animals.&lt;ref name=":14x" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11910">In studies of the [[public understanding of science]], the '''information deficit model''' (or simply '''deficit model''') or '''science literacy/knowledge deficit model''' attributes public scepticism or hostility to science and technology to a lack of understanding, resulting from a lack of information.  It is associated with a division between experts who have the information and non-experts who do not.  The model implies that communication should focus on improving the transfer of information from experts to non-experts.

==Deficit model of science communication==

The original term ‘deficit model’ was coined in the 1980s by [[social scientists]] studying the public communication of science. The purpose of the phrase was not to introduce a new mode of science communication but rather it was to characterise a widely held belief that underlies much of what is carried out in the name of such activity. 

There are two aspects to this belief. The first is the idea that public uncertainty and scepticism towards modern science including environmental issues and technology is caused primarily by a lack of sufficient knowledge about science and the relevant subjects. The second aspect relates to the idea that by providing the adequate information to overcome this lack of knowledge, also known as a ‘knowledge deficit’, the general [[public opinion]] will change and decide that the information provided on the environment and science as a whole is reliable and accurate.&lt;ref name="Dickson"&gt;Dickson, D. 2005. [http://www.scidev.net/global/communication/editorials/the-case-for-a-deficit-model-of-science-communic.html The Case for a ‘deficit model’ of science communication]. ''Science and Development Network''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists are often heard to complain that the general public does not understand science, and that the public needs to be educated. In the deficit model scientists assume that there is a knowledge deficit that can be ‘fixed’ by giving the public more information: scientists often assume that “given the facts (whatever they are), the public will happily support new technologies.”&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, S. 2009. [http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v4/n10/full/nnano.2009.278.html The new deficit model]. ''Nature Nanotechnology'' '''4''':609-611.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The deficit model, however, has been discredited by a wealth of literature that shows that simply giving more information to people does not necessarily change their views.&lt;ref&gt;Kearnes M., Macnaghten P. &amp; Wilsdon, J. Governing at the Nanoscale (Demos, 2006); available at &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/governingatthenanoscale |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214083000/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/governingatthenanoscale |archivedate=2007-12-14 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly because people want to feel that they have had their say (and have been heard) in any decision-making process, and partly because people make decisions based on a host of factors as well as the scientific ‘facts’. These factors include [[ethical]] and religious beliefs, in addition to culture, history and personal experience. This amounts to a kind of gut feeling, which scientific facts are unlikely to change. Put another way, people’s sense of risk extends beyond the purely scientific considerations of conventional risk analysis, and the deficit model marginalises these ‘[[externalities]]’. It is now widely accepted that the best alternative to deficit model thinking is to genuinely engage with the public and take these externalities into account.&lt;ref&gt;Boykoff, MT (2009), Creating a Climate for Change: Communicating Climate Change and Facilitating Social Change. Glob. Environ. Polit. 9 (2) 123-128&lt;/ref&gt;

The deficit model sees the general population as the receiver of information and scientific knowledge. The information they receive, through whatever medium, has been prearranged to inform them of information that the distributors believe to be in the public’s interest. Due to the recent growth of scientific research and subsequent discoveries, the deficit model suggests that this has led to a decrease in interest surrounding certain areas of science. This can be down to the public feeling overwhelmed with information and becomes uninterested, as it appears too much to take in. 

The deficit model of scientific understanding makes assumptions about the public’s knowledge. The model perceives them to be “blank slates” where their knowledge of scientific discourse and research is almost non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Jane and Miller, Steve (2000), Science in Public: Communication, Culture and Credibility, (London: Perseus)&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this is the knowledge deficit that needs to be informed by a reliable, knowledgeable and hierarchical scientific community in the form of simple commands and generic instructions. But the increase in new information systems such as the Internet and their ease of accessibility has led to a greater knowledge of scientific research and this is evident as the public’s understanding can be seen to be growing.{{Citation needed|reason=Can this statement be validated?|date=August 2017}} This is a good thing in terms of the members of the public that can actively increase their own knowledge base, decrease the knowledge deficit and assess the truth and validity of what [[mass media]] outlets and [[governments]] are telling them. This should enhance and increase the relationship between the passive “blank slates” of the public, with the minority of the population who hold the ‘knowledge surplus’.

===Evidence for a deficit affecting opinion===
A 420 meta-analysis of 193 studies sought to interpret the link between science knowledge and attitude towards science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allum|first1=Nick|author2=Sturgis P, Tabourazi D, Brunton-Smith I|title=Science knowledge and attitudes across cultures: a meta-analysis|journal=Public Understanding of Science|date=2008|volume=17|pages=35–54|doi=10.1177/0963662506070159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies included were taken using nonuniform methods across the world between 1989 and 2004 to provide a cross-cultural analysis. Broad and specific science knowledge and attitude categories were correlated. General science and general biology knowledge was gauged using questions similar to those by the [[National Science Foundation]] used to capture "civil scientific literacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=J.D.|title=Scientific Literacy: a Conceptual and Empirical Review|journal=Dedalus|date=1983|volume=11|pages=29–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data on general science and biology knowledge was then compared with attitudes towards general science, nuclear power, genetic medicine, [[genetically modified food]], and environmental science. From the raw data, it was found that a small positive correlation exists between general science knowledge and attitude towards science, indicating that increased scientific knowledge is related to a favorable attitude towards a science topic, and that this was not related to socioeconomic or technologic status of a country, but rather the number of individuals enrolled in tertiary education. However, some studies have found that high levels of science knowledge may indicate highly positive and highly negative attitudes towards specific topics such as agriculture [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durant |first=J. |title=Biotechnology in Public: a Review of Recent Research|publisher=Science Museum Publications|date=1992|location=London|pages=28–41|author2=Martin, S Tait, J.|authorlink=Attitudes of Selected Public Groups in the UK to Biotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus knowledge may be a predictor of the attitude strength and not necessarily if the attitude is positive or negative.

==The role of the media==

[[Mass media]] representations, ranging from news to entertainment, are critical links between the everyday realities of how people experience certain issues and the ways in which these are discussed at a distance between science, policy and public actors.&lt;ref name="Dickson"/&gt; Numerous studies show that the public frequently learn about science and more specifically issues such as climate change from the mass media. 

There is perceived to be a trend within much of the world’s media that a traditional commitment to report the full facts is and has given way to a more obvious, less reliable tendency to concentrate coverage on interpretations of the facts. This so-called ‘spin’ is reported by the world’s press under a combination of commercial and political pressure. This can be dangerous as it ‘fills’ the knowledge deficit and the unsuspecting public with sometimes unreliable, agenda promoting information. The subjects of anthropogenic [[global warming]] and [[climate change]] are at the forefront of this. However, in all cases it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate out the factual basis of what is being reported from the ‘spin’ that is exerted on the way a story is reported and presented.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The mass media is accessible to the vast numbers of the global population and ranging from entertainment, to news media, and spanning books, films, televisions, newspapers, radio, games and the Internet. More modern forms of communication and receiving of information have given the public a much wider and accessible format in which to gain knowledge themselves. 

The actual processes behind the communication and dissemination of information from the experts to the public may be far more complex and deep running than the deficit model suggests.

The knowledge deficit model is important for science communicators to know about. This is particularly important with respect to the concept of [[framing (social sciences)|framing]] when communicating information. Framing can be used to reduce the complexity of an issue, or to persuade audiences, and can play into the underlying religious beliefs, moral values, prior knowledge, and even trust in scientists or political individuals. Further, the transmission of scientific ideas and technological adoption may be strongly linked to the passage of information between easily influenced individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watts|first1=Duncan J. |author2=Dodds, P.S.|title=Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=2007|volume=34|pages=441–458|doi=10.1086/518527}}&lt;/ref&gt; versus the widely accepted "two-step flow" theory where a few opinion leaders acted as intermediaries between mass media and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Eliju|author2=Lazersfeld, P.F.|title=Personal Influence; the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communication|date=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreasing the knowledge deficit is a complicated task, but if we know how the general public thinks, or how they go about learning and interpreting new information, we can better communicate our message to them in the most unbiased, objective way possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scheufele |first=Dietram |title=MESSAGES AND HEURISTICS: HOW AUDIENCES FORM ATTITUDES ABOUT EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES|location=Engaging Science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action|pages=21–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative models==
In contrast to the knowledge-deficit model is the [[low-information rationality]] model that states humans minimize costs associated with making decisions and forming attitudes, thereby avoiding developing in-depth understandings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7854">A '''[[biobank]]''' is a physical place which stores [[biobank specimens]].  In some cases, participant data is also collected and stored. Access policies details may vary across biobanks but generally involve obtaining [[ethics]] approval from [[institutional review board]]s and scientific review or [[peer review]] approval from the institutions under which the biobanks operate as well as Ethics approval from the institutions where the research projects will be undertaken.  The samples and data are safeguarded so that researchers can use them in experiments deemed adequate.  This page contains a list of biobanks.

==Classification==
Biobanks can be classified in several ways.  Some examples of how they can be classified is by their controlling entity (government, commercial enterprise, or private research institution), by their geographical location, or by what sorts of samples they collect.

Biobanks may be classified by purpose or design. Disease-oriented biobanks usually have a hospital affiliation through which they collect samples representing a variety of diseases, perhaps to look for biomarkers affiliated with disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bevilacqua | first1 = G. | last2 = Bosman | first2 = F. | last3 = Dassesse | first3 = T. | last4 = Höfler | first4 = H. | last5 = Janin | first5 = A. | last6 = Langer | first6 = R. | last7 = Larsimont | first7 = D. | last8 = Morente | first8 = M.

The '''logic of information''', or the ''logical theory of information'', considers the information content of logical [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and expressions along the lines initially developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].  In this line of work, the concept of information serves to integrate the aspects of signs and expressions that are separately covered, on the one hand, by the concepts of [[denotation]] and [[extension (semantics)|extension]], and on the other hand, by the concepts of [[connotation]] and [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]].

Peirce began to develop these ideas in his lectures "On the Logic of Science" at [[Harvard University]] (1865) and the [[Lowell Institute]] (1866).

Mary E. Williamson was born on April 24, 1924, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], to Elmer C. Williamson and Ruth Peterman Williamson.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt; Mary was an only child, whom her mother Ruth raised on her own. The two remained very close throughout her life.&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;

Williamson decided to attend [[Baker University]] after high school in 1941, but soon transferred to the [[Missouri School of Journalism]] at the [[University of Missouri]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]]. She finished this two-year program quickly and left for Sweetwater, Texas, in April 1944 to train as a pilot in the WASP ([[Women Air Force Service Pilots]]) program.&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt; She served from April 1 to September 1, 1944, but never served on a mission before the war came to an end.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;
            
==Career==
After her discharge, Williamson returned to Kansas City and acquired a job as the public relations director for the Kansas City Tuberculosis Society. Through this position, she was offered an opportunity to further her education, and eventually went on to obtain her master's degree from [[Columbia University]] in New York. After graduating, Williamson moved to Washington D.C., and took a job as an editor. However, wanting to be closer to her home, Williamson returned to St. Louis and accepted a position in broadcasting.&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;&lt;ref name=reflections&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=John|title=Reflections in Time Dr. Mary E. Williamson Interview|url=http://unomaha.worldcat.org/oclc/52643375|website=Reflections in Time|publisher=University of Nebraska at Omaha|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson began teaching in the Department of Speech and Mass communication at the [[University of Nebraska Omaha]] (UNO) in 1969.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt; Her first year at UNO Williamson taught courses such as Speech 101, Introduction to Mass Communications, Television Production and Radio Production. Williamson also served as [[PanHellenic]] advisor to the Greek communities on campus.&lt;ref name=gateway1976&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kurtz|first1=Terry|title=Greek Life Analyzed to Update '50s Image|url=http://digital.olivesoftware.com/olive/apa/unomaha/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=GTW%2F1976%2F10%2F22&amp;id=Ar00400&amp;sk=AD66CB0E|accessdate=31 March 2015|publisher=The Gateway|date=22 October 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson finished her doctoral program in 1973 with the publication of her thesis "An Inquiry into Excellence in Commercial Broadcasting". Williamson incorporated work experience with the Nebraska Business Development Center (NBDC) in many of her courses, so that students were able to provide services and advice to small business owners in the Omaha area.
            
Throughout her time at UNO, Williamson served in various roles across campus. She was elected to Faculty Senate and served her second term as Vice President in 1977 and then as President in 1978.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt; During this service, she successfully removed gendered language from UNO's diploma despite some strong opposition. (7) Williamson served as the executive assistant to UNO Chancellor Del Weber from 1980 until 1986. Also in this time period, she was appointed Interim Dean for the College of Fine Arts for two years and later as the Interim University Relations Director, where she was responsible for public outreach for the university.&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;&lt;ref name=morewomen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Marge|title=More Women Rank High at UNO|url=http://digital.olivesoftware.com/olive/apa/unomaha/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=GTW%2F1981%2F02%2F06&amp;id=Ar00500&amp;sk=C47EE9D5|accessdate=31 March 2015|publisher=The Gateway|date=6 February 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson Appointed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Williamson Appointed to Aid UNO Chancellor Weber|url=http://digital.olivesoftware.com/olive/apa/unomaha/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=GTW%2F1981%2F01%2F16&amp;id=Ar00301&amp;sk=520BFC36|publisher=The Gateway|date=16 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her interim stints in both departments, Williamson returned to the Communications Department as acting department chair. She took partial retirement shortly after and began working closely with NBDC as a business consultant.&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt; Williamson retired in 2004 after 35 years of teaching at UNO.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;

In 1981, Williamson became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.
            	
==Community service==
Williamson also worked as the Vice President of Nebraska Cable Television and was later appointed by the mayor of Omaha to the community's Cable Television Advisory Committee for two terms.
            
After retirement she remained active around Omaha by filling a volunteer capacity in various organizations. Williamson served as an [[ombudsman]] at the Ambassador Rehabilitation Center, a counselor at the [[Service Corps of Retired Executives]] (SCORE), and assisted the Hearts United for Animals shelter.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;
 
==Awards==
Williamson received recognition for her service to the Faculty Senate in the 1970s and a certificate from the University of Nebraska Board of Regents in 1982 for her dedication to improving UNO. NBDC presented Williamson with the UNO Small Business Institute Award in 1987 and 1990 and then an award for her contribution to the Nebraska Small Business Community in 1992. Chancellor Nancy Belck presented Williamson with a plaque recognizing her service and devotion to UNO upon retirement. In 2007, the United Way of Midlands honored Williamson for her services and time, and she also received a certificate from her time as ombudsman at the Ambassador Rehabilitation Center.&lt;ref name="Grave" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAP" /&gt;
            
In 2010, at the age of 86, Williamson was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] for her service as a Women Airforce Service Pilot (WASP) in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=WWII&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hovey|first1=Art|title=WWII Women Pilots Get Belated Recognition|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/wwii-women-pilots-get-belated-recognition/article_18f95106-768a-11df-bb07-001cc4c002e0.html|accessdate=31 March 2015|agency=Lincoln Journal Star|date=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">The '''{{Lang|fr|Méthode pour la guitare}}''' is a method for the [[classical guitar]] originally written in French by guitarist and composer [[Fernando Sor]].

The method was written with the early romantic guitar in mind (Sor mentions some 19th-century guitar-builders: J. Panormo, Schroeder of Petersburg, Alonso of Madrid, Pages and Benitez of Cadiz, Joseph and Manuel Martinez of Malaga, Rada, and Lacôte of Paris), but it is not only about instrumental technique, but also includes details about the theory of [[Scale (music)|scales]], [[harmony]], [[wiktionary:sonority|sonority]], composition, and above all music as an art.

==French and German edition==

[[File:Sor Methode.png|thumb|''Méthode pour la guitare'']]
The first edition was in French and appeared in Paris in 1830 with the title of ''{{lang|fr|Méthode pour la guitare par Ferdinand Sor}}''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdh.bne.es/bnesearch/detalle/3276952 ''Méthode pour la guitare par Ferdinand Sor'' (1830)], [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]]&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Jeffery (the modern publisher of A. Merrick's old English translation) mentions: "It is the only version known to have Sor's direct authority. Now extremely rare, it was never reprinted; indeed, an early biographer of Sor (Baltasar Saldoni in his ''Diccionario de Efemérides de Músicos Españoles'', I, Madrid, 1868) says (he does not state on what authority) that Sor destroyed the plates."&lt;ref name="jeff" /&gt; During the same period [[Nikolaus Simrock|Simrock]] in Bonn had brought out a parallel French and German edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.kb.dk/elib/noder/rischel/RiBS0788.pdf ''Méthode pour la guitare = Guitarre-Schule''] (Bonn: [[Nikolaus Simrock|N. Simrock]], 1831)&lt;/ref&gt;

==English edition==

The English edition is a translation from the original in French made by A. Merrick, the organist of [[Cirencester]], and published in London by Cocks &amp; Co. probably in 1832, as ''Method for the Spanish Guitar''. &lt;ref&gt;[http://bdh.bne.es/bnesearch/detalle/3275624 ''Method for the Spanish Guitar''], [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]]&lt;/ref&gt; The French and German versions do not carry the word "Spanish" in the title. This version is today available from Brian Jeffery's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tecla.com/catalog/0389.htm Fernando Sor – ''Method for the Spanish Guitar'' (1832)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407211504/http://www.tecla.com/catalog/0389.htm |date=2010-04-07 }}, Tecla Editions&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Jeffery mentions: "Later in the century, in 1897, Frank Mott Harrison published in London a ''Method for the Guitar'' by Ferdinando Sor,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muslib.se/ebibliotek/boije/pdf/Boije%201140.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a work of small value which says (of course wrongly) that the original was written in Spanish."&lt;ref name="jeff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecla.com/extras/0001/0389/0389pref.htm|title=Sor: Method for the Spanish Guitar – preface to the Tecla edition | author = Brian Jeffery | publisher=Tecla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coste's adapted and augmented version==

After Sor's death, [[Napoléon Coste]], one of his pupils, published a revision of the original called ''{{lang|fr|Méthode complète pour la Guitare par Ferdinand Sor, rédigée et augmentée de nombreux exemples et leçons par N. Coste}}''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.kb.dk/elib/noder/rischel/RiBS0789.pdf [http://www2.kb.dk/elib/noder/rischel/RiBS0790.pdf alt.]&lt;/ref&gt; Matanya Ophee states that in Coste's revised and augmented version, there is an introduction which is helpful in better understanding Sor, and some of the circumstances under which Sor wrote the original method.&lt;ref name="ophee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarandluteissues.com/methods/methods.htm|title=A Brief History of Spanish Guitar Methods | author = Matanya Ophee | publisher=Éditions Orphée}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Jeffery controversially regards Coste's version somewhat negatively ("travesty of the original ... bears little resemblance to the original"),&lt;ref name="jeff" /&gt; even though the title immediately makes it clear, that it is not the original, but was adapted and augmented by Coste (augmented incidentally, with numerous pieces of high quality). Today Coste's version is highly regarded in its own right (the title mentioning of Sor, possibly being more a sign of respect, than what Jeffery has termed "a disservice to his friend's memory"). Ophee has written: "He [Coste] is certainly not hostile to Sor and to his memory".&lt;ref name="ophee" /&gt;

==Various details==
In the method (in plate VII, example 27), Sor quotes bars 22 to 25 of Sonata Op. 35, No. 1 by [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]]; mentioning "that the celebrated Düssek had the texture of the orchestra in view when he wrote for the pianoforte the passage in example twenty-seventh, plate VII."

'''Necrophilia''', also known as '''necrophilism''', '''necrolagnia''', '''necrocoitus''', '''necrochlesis''', and '''thanatophilia''',{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=1}} is a [[sexual attraction]] or sexual act involving [[Cadaver|corpses]]. It is classified as a [[paraphilia]] by [[ICD10]] published by [[WHO]] and the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (DSM) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref name="goodwin"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Robin|editor1-last=Goodwin|editor2-first=Duncan|editor2-last=Cramer|title=Inappropriate Relationships: The Unconventional, the Disapproved, and the Forbidden|pages=174–176|publisher=Psychology Press|location=London, England|date=2002|ISBN= 978-0805837421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosman and Resnick (1989) reviewed information from 34 cases of necrophilia describing the individuals' motivations for their behaviors: these individuals reported the desire to possess a non-resisting and non-rejecting partner (68%), reunions with a romantic partner (21%), sexual attraction to corpses (15%), comfort or overcoming feelings of isolation (15%), or seeking self-esteem by expressing power over a homicide victim (12%).&lt;ref name="rosman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosman | first1 = J.

==Origins of term==
The term 'necrophilia' is thought to have been coined by Belgian physician [[Joseph Guislain]] in his ''Leçons Orales sur les Phrénopathies'', in a lecture given around 1850, in reference to contemporary necrophile [[François Bertrand]]:&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal p.4&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|It is within the category of the destructive madmen [''aliénés destructeurs''] that one needs to situate certain patients to whom I would like to give the name of necrophiliacs [''nécrophiles'']. The alienists have adopted, as a new form, the case of Sergeant Bertrand, the disinterrer of cadavers on whom all the newspapers have recently reported. However, don't think that we are dealing here with a form of phrenopathy which appears for the first time. The ancients, in speaking about [[lycanthropy]], have cited examples to which one can more or less relate the case which has just attracted the public attention so strongly.}}
The term was popularized about a decade later by psychiatrist [[Bénédict Morel]], who also discussed Bertrand.&lt;ref name="goodwin" /&gt;

==History==
In the ancient world, sailors returning corpses to their home country were often accused of necrophilia.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=2}} Singular accounts of necrophilia in history are sporadic, though written records suggest the practice was present within [[Ancient Egypt]]. [[Herodotus]] writes in [[Histories (Herodotus)|''The Histories'']] that, to discourage intercourse with a corpse, ancient [[Egypt]]ians left deceased beautiful women to decay for "three or four days" before giving them to the [[embalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herodotus (c. 440 BC) |title=The Histories (Book 2) |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2707 |quote=The wives of men of rank when they die are not given at once to be embalmed, nor such women as are very beautiful or of greater regard than others, but on the third or fourth day after their death (and not before) they are delivered to the embalmers. They do so about this matter in order that the embalmers may not abuse their women, for they say that one of them was taken once doing so to the corpse of a woman lately dead, and his fellow-craftsman gave information.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brill | first1 = Abraham A. | date= 1941 | title = Necrophilia | journal = Journal of Criminal Psychopathology | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 433–443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="klaf"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Franklin S.|last1=Klaf |first2=William|last2=Brown  |date= 1958 | title = Necrophilia: Brief Review and Case Report | journal = Psychiatric Quarterly | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 645–652 | quote = Inhibited forms of necrophilia and necrophiliac fantasies may occur more commonly then is generally realized. | doi=10.1007/bf01563024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus also alluded to suggestions that Greek tyrant [[Periander]] had defiled the corpse of his wife, employing a metaphor: "Periander baked his bread in a cold oven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Anil |last= Aggrawal| date = 2010 | title = Necrophilia: Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects | publisher = CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida| ISBN= 978-1420089127|pages = 6–7|quote=The primary source is ''Histories'', Book V, 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of necrophilia are depicted on ceramics from the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture, which reigned in northern [[Peru]] from the first to eighth century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steve|last=Finbow | date = 2014 | title = Grave Desire: A Cultural History of Necrophilia | publisher = John Hunt Publishing | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rGIpBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT4&amp;ots=74OrhG8hA4&amp;pg=PT39}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common theme in these artifacts is the masturbation of a male skeleton by a living woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weismantel, M. | year = 2004 | title = Moche sex pots: Reproduction and temporality in ancient South America | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–496 | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/moche/moche-sex-pots.pdf | doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.3.495}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hittites|Hittite]] law from the 16th century BC through to the 13th century BC explicitly permitted sex with the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Boer, Roland | year = 2014 | title = Sex in Antiquity: Exploring Gender and Sexuality in the Ancient World | chapter = From Horse Kissing to Beastly Emissions: Paraphilias in the Ancient Near East | editor = Masterson, Mark | publisher = Routledge | page = 69 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k1G2BQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;ots=DtUbHRO19Dlr&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what is now [[Northeast China]], the ethnic [[Xianbei]] emperor [[Murong Xi]] (385–407) of the [[Later Yan]] state had intercourse with the corpse of his beloved empress [[Fu Xunying]], after the latter was already cold and put into the coffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tales about Chinese Emperors: Their Wild and Wise Ways|chapter=The Corpse-Raping Emperor|last=Luan Pao-chün|year=1994|pages=148–?|isbn=|publisher=Hai Feng Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Renaissance Italy]], following the reputed moral collapse brought about by the [[Black Death]] and before the [[Roman Inquisition]] of the [[Counter-Reformation]], the literature was replete with sexual references; these include necrophilia, in the case of the epic poem ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'' by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]], first published in 1483.&lt;ref name="DavidsonDean1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davidson|first1=Nicholas|last2=Dean|first2=Trevor|last3=Lowe|first3=K.

In the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], fifth edition ([[DSM-5]]), recurrent, intense sexual interest in corpses can be diagnosed under [[Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder]] (necrophilia) when it causes marked distress or impairment in important areas of functioning.&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder, 302.89 (F65.89) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | page = 705}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ten-tier classification of necrophilia exists:&lt;ref name="aggrawal_classification"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aggrawal, Anil |title=A new classification of necrophilia |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=316–20 |year=2009 |pmid=19573840 |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2008.12.023 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1752928X08002564}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Role players: People who get aroused from [[Sexual roleplay|pretending]] their live partner is dead during sexual activity.
# Romantic necrophiliacs: Bereaved people who remain attached to their dead lover's body.
# Necrophilic fantasizers: People who fantasize about necrophilia, but never actually have sex with a corpse.
# Tactile necrophiliacs: People who are aroused by touching or stroking a corpse, without engaging in intercourse.
# [[Sexual fetishism|Fetishistic]] necrophiliacs: People who remove objects (e.g., panties or a tampon) or body parts (e.g., a finger or genitalia) from a corpse for sexual purposes, without engaging in intercourse.
# Necromutilomaniacs: People who derive pleasure from mutilating a corpse while masturbating, without engaging in intercourse.
# Opportunistic necrophiliacs: People who normally have no interest in necrophilia, but take the opportunity when it arises.
# Regular necrophiliacs: People who preferentially have intercourse with the dead.
# Homicidal necrophiliacs: Necrosadists,{{sfn|Purcell|2006|p=21}} people who commit [[lust murder|murder]] in order to have sex with the victim.
# Exclusive necrophiliacs: People who have an exclusive interest in sex with the dead, and cannot perform at all for a living partner.
Additionally, criminologist [[Lee Mellor]]'s typology of homicidal necrophiles consists of eight categories (A–H), and is based on the combination of two behavioral axes: destructive (offender [[Mutilation|mutilates]] the corpse for sexual reasons) – preservative (offender does not), and cold (offender used the corpse sexually two hours after death) – warm (offender used the corpse sexually earlier than two hours after death).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homicide: A Forensic Psychology Casebook|last=Mellor|first=Lee|publisher=CRC|year=2016|isbn=|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; This renders four categories (A-D) to which Mellor adds an additional four (E-H):
* Category A (cold/destructive), e.g. [[Ted Bundy]], [[Jeffrey Dahmer]]
* Category B (cold/preservative), e.g. [[Gary Ridgway]], [[Dennis Nilsen]]
* Category C (warm/destructive) e.g. [[Andrei Chikatilo]], [[Joseph Vacher]]
* Category D (warm/preservative) e.g. [[Robert Lee Yates|Robert Yates]], [[Earle Nelson]]
* Category E (dabblers) e.g. [[Richard Ramirez]], [[Mark Dixie]]
* Category F ([[Fredric Wertham|catathymic]]){{clarify|date=November 2018}}
* Category G (exclusive necromutilophiles) e.g. [[Robert Napper]], [[Peter Sutcliffe]]
* Category H (sexual [[Human cannibalism|cannibals]] &amp; vampires) e.g. [[Albert Fish]], [[Peter Kürten]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
Dabblers have transitory opportunistic sexual relations with corpses, but this is not their preference. Category F homicidal necrophiles commit postmortem sex acts only while in a [[Fredric Wertham|catathymic]] state. Exclusive mutilophiles derive pleasure purely from mutilating the corpse, while sexual [[Human cannibalism|cannibals]] and vampires are sexually aroused by eating human body parts. Category A, C, and F offenders may also cannibalize or drink the blood of their victims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Research==

===Humans===
Necrophilia is often assumed to be rare, but no data for its prevalence in the general population exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =  Milner, J. S., Dopke, C. A., &amp; Crouch, J. L.  | date= 2008 | title = Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment, 2nd edition | publisher = The Guilford Press | page = 399 | chapter = Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified: Psychopathology and Theory | editor = Laws, D. Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some necrophiles only fantasize about the act, without carrying it out.&lt;ref name="rosman" /&gt; In 1958, Klaf and Brown commented that, although rarely described, necrophiliac [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] may occur more often than is generally supposed.&lt;ref name="klaf"/&gt;

Rosman and Resnick (1989) reviewed 122 cases of necrophilia. The sample was divided into genuine necrophiles, who had a persistent attraction to corpses, and pseudo-necrophiles, who acted out of opportunity, sadism, or transient interest.  Of the total, 92% were male and 8% were female. 57% of the genuine necrophiles had occupational access to corpses, with morgue attendant, hospital orderly, and cemetery employee being the most common jobs. The researchers theorized that either of the following situations could be antecedents to necrophilia:&lt;ref name="rosman" /&gt;
#The necrophile develops poor [[self-esteem]], perhaps due in part to a significant loss;
#:(a) They are very fearful of rejection by others and they desire a sexual partner who is incapable of rejecting them; and/or
#:(b) They are fearful of the dead, and transform their fear—by means of [[reaction formation]]—into a desire.
#They develop an exciting fantasy of sex with a corpse, sometimes after exposure to a corpse.

The authors reported that, of their sample of genuine necrophiles:&lt;ref name="rosman" /&gt;
*68% were motivated by a desire for an unresisting and unrejecting partner;
*21% by a want for reunion with a lost partner;
*15% by sexual attraction to dead people;
*15% by a desire for comfort or to overcome feelings of isolation; and
*12% by a desire to remedy low self-esteem by expressing power over a corpse.

IQ data was limited, but not abnormally low. About half of the sample had a personality disorder, and 11% of true necrophiles were psychotic. Rosman and Resnick concluded that their data challenged the conventional view of necrophiles as generally psychotic, mentally deficient, or unable to obtain a consenting partner.&lt;ref name="rosman" /&gt;

The label is still used for necrophilia in animals.&lt;ref name="costa" /&gt; Certain species of arachnids and insects practice [[sexual cannibalism]], in which the female cannibalizes her male mate prior to, during, or after copulation.

[[Kees Moeliker]] made one observation while he was sitting in his office at the [[Natural History Museum Rotterdam]], when he heard the distinctive thud of a bird hitting the glass facade of the building. Upon inspection, he discovered a drake (male) [[mallard]] lying dead outside the building. Next to the downed bird there was a second drake mallard standing close by. As Moeliker observed the couple, the living drake pecked at the corpse of the dead one for a few minutes  then mounted the corpse and began copulating with it. The act of necrophilia lasted for about 75 minutes, in which time, according to Moeliker, the living drake took two short breaks before resuming with copulating behavior. Moeliker surmised that at the time of the collision with the window the two mallards were engaged in a common pattern in [[duck]] behavior called "attempted [[rape]] flight". "When one died the other one just went for it and didn't get any negative feedback &amp;mdash; well, didn't get any feedback," according to Moeliker.&lt;ref name="Mallard Duck"&gt;{{cite journal | author=C.W.

==Legality==
'''Australia'''

Necrophilia is not explicitly mentioned in Australian law, however, under the Crimes Act 1900 - Sect 81C it states misconduct with regard to corpses is any person who:

(a) indecently interferes with any dead human body, or

(b) improperly interferes with, or offers any indignity to, any dead human body or human remains (whether buried or not),

shall be liable to imprisonment for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s81c.html|title=CRIMES ACT 1900 - SECT 81C
Misconduct with regard to corpses|website=www6.austlii.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===

Article 212 of the Brazilian Penal Code (federal Decree-Law No 2.848) states as follows:&lt;ref name=bpc&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del2848compilado.htm |title=Código Penal (Decreto-Lei nº 2.848) |publisher=Presidency of the Republic |date=December 7, 1940 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Free translation from Brazilian Portuguese to English.&lt;/ref&gt;
		 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Art. 212 - To abuse a cadaver or its ashes:&lt;br&gt;Penalty: detention, from 1 to 3 years, plus fine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Although sex with a corpse is not explicitly mentioned, a person who has sex with a corpse may be convicted of  a crime under the above Article. The legal asset protected by such Article is not the corpse's objective honor, but the feeling of good memories, respect and veneration that living people keep about the deceased person: these persons are considered passive subjects of the corpse's violation.

===India===
Section 297 of the Indian Penal Code entitled "Trespassing on burial places, etc.", states as follows:&lt;ref name="ipc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mynation.net/ipc.htm#_Toc496765169 |title=The Indian Penal Code (IPC): Dowry Law Misuse (IPC 448) By Indian Women |publisher=Mynation.net |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever, with the intention of wounding the feelings of any person, or of insulting the religion of any person, or with the knowledge that the feelings of any person are likely to be wounded, or that the religion of any person is likely to be insulted thereby,
commits any trespass in any place of worship or on any place of sculpture, or any place set apart from the performance of funeral rites or as a depository for the remains of the dead, or offers any indignity to any human corpse, or causes disturbance to any persons assembled for the performance of funeral ceremonies, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although sex with a corpse is not explicitly mentioned, a person who has sex with a corpse may be convicted under the above section. [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]] could also be invoked.

===New Zealand===
Under Section 150 of the New Zealand [[Crimes Act 1961]], it is an offence for there to be "misconduct in respect to human remains". Subsection (b) elaborates that this applies if someone "improperly or indecently interferes with or offers indignity to any dead human body or human remains, whether buried or not". This statute is therefore applicable to sex with corpses and carries a potential two-year prison sentence, although there is no case law as yet that would apply the aforementioned statute.&lt;ref&gt;Butterworths Crimes Act 1961: Wellington: Butterworths: 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Section 14 of the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]] prohibits the commission of a sexual act with a corpse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2007-032.pdf |format=PDF |title=Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act 32 of 2007 |at=sec. 14 |date=December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523214416/http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2007-032.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until codified by the act it was a [[common law offence]].

===Sweden===
Section 16, § 10 of the Swedish Penal Code criminalizes necrophilia, but it is not explicitly mentioned. Necrophilia falls under the regulations against abusing a corpse or grave (''brott mot griftefrid''), which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. One person has been convicted of necrophilia. He was sentenced to psychiatric care for that and other crimes, including arson.&lt;ref name="HD06"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hd.se/2006-10-06/fakta-nekrofili-och-brott-mot-griftefrid |title=Fakta: Nekrofili och brott mot griftefrid |work=HD |access-date=2017-09-21 |language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom ===
Sexual penetration of a corpse was made illegal under the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], carrying a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment. Prior to 2003, necrophilia was not illegal; however, exposing a naked corpse in public was classed as a [[public nuisance]] (''R v. Clark [1883] 15 Cox 171'').&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal p.200&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
There is no federal legislation specifically barring sex with a corpse. Multiple states have their own laws:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Aggrawal, Anil | year = 2010 | title = Necrophilia: Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects | publisher = CRC Press | pages = 201–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Posner, Richard A. |author2=Silbaugh, Katharine B. | year = 1996 | title = A Guide to America's Sex Laws | publisher = University of Chicago Press | pages = 213–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2634">The '''ORTF stereo microphone system''', also known as [[Side-Other-Side]], is a [[microphone]] technique used to record [[stereo sound]].

[[Image:ORTF-Stereo.svg|thumb|ORTF setup.]]

It was devised around 1960 at the [[Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française]]
(ORTF) at [[Radio France]].

ORTF combines both the volume difference provided as sound arrives on- and off-axis at two [[cardioid]] microphones spread to a 110° angle, as well as the timing difference as sound arrives at the two microphones spaced 17 cm apart. &lt;ref&gt;[http://old.hfm-detmold.de/eti/projekte/semesterarbeiten/hauptmikro/hauptmikro_en.html Microphone Techniques for Stereo Recording]. Retrieved January 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The microphones should be as similar as possible, preferably a frequency-matched pair of an identical type and model.

The result is a realistic stereo field that has reasonable compatibility with mono playback. Since the cardioid polar pattern rejects off-axis sound, less of the ambient room characteristics are picked up. This means that the mics can be placed farther away from the sound sources, resulting in a blend that may be more appealing. Further, the availability of purpose-built microphone mounts makes ORTF easy to achieve.

As with all microphone arrangements, the spacing and angle can be manually adjusted slightly by ear for the best sound, which may vary depending on room acoustics, source characteristics, and other factors. But this arrangement is defined as it is because it was the result of considerable research and experimentation, and its results are predictable and repeatable.

These interchannel differences are not the same as interaural differences, as produced by [[artificial head]] recordings. Even the spacing of 17 cm is not strictly based on interaural ear spacing. The recording angle for this microphone system is ±48° = 96°. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reddingaudio.com/downloads/Rycote%20Technical/The%20Stereophonic%20Zoom.pdf The stereophonic zoom - pdf].

An '''oil burner engine''' is a [[steam engine]] that uses [[Fuel oil|oil]] as its fuel. The term is usually applied to a [[locomotive]] or [[ship]] engine that burns oil to heat water, to produce the steam which drives the [[piston]]s, or [[steam turbine|turbine]]s, from which the power is derived.

This is mechanically very different from [[diesel engine]]s, which use [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]], although they are sometimes [[colloquially]] referred to as oil burners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spinelli|first1=Mike|title=Diesel on the Range: Land Rover Flagship to Come in Oil-Burner|url=http://jalopnik.com/176359/diesel-on-the-range-land-rover-flagship-to-come-in-oil-burner|accessdate=2017-09-08|work=[[Jalopnik]]|date=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early pioneer of this form of engine was [[James Holden (engineer)|James Holden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marine Fuels |author= Cletus H.

In James Holden's system, steam was raised by burning coal before the oil fuel was turned on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lner.info/co/GER/locomotives.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion==
Some oil-burning engines were originally designed to be coal powered but were converted. When a coal-burning steam locomotive is converted to burn oil, various modifications are usual:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
# the grate is covered with broken [[firebrick]] to act as a reservoir of heat.  If the oil flame is blown out (e.g. by a downdraft when entering a tunnel) the hot firebrick will re-ignite it
# the lower part of the inner [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] is lined with firebrick
# shorter [[superheater]] elements are fitted

The latter two changes are needed because oil firing produces higher temperatures than coal firing, and can cause rapid erosion of metal.  For a similar reason, the [[smokebox]] is sometimes painted with silver-coloured heat-resisting paint.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20121">In [[molecular biology]], an '''oscillating gene''' is a gene that is expressed in a rhythmic pattern or in periodic cycles.&lt;ref name="tuttle"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tuttle | first1 = LM | last2 = Salis | first2 = H | last3 = Tomshine | first3 = J | last4 = Kaznessis | first4 = YN | year = 2005 | title = Model-Driven Designs of an Oscillating Gene Network | url = | journal = Biophys.

[[Circadian rhythms]], controlled by oscillating genes, have a period of approximately 24 hours. For example, plant leaves opening and closing at different times of the day or the sleep-wake schedule of animals can all include circadian rhythms. Other periods are also possible, such as 29.5 days resulting from circalunar rhythms or 12.4 hours resulting from circatidal rhythms.&lt;ref name="moore"/&gt; Oscillating genes include both core clock component genes and output genes. A core clock component gene is a gene necessary for to the pacemaker. However, an output oscillating gene, such as the [[Vasopressin|AVP]] gene, is rhythmic but not necessary to the pacemaker.&lt;ref name="buhr"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buhr | first1 = ED | last2 = Takahashi | first2 = JS | year = 2013 | title = Molecular Components of the Mammalian Circadian Clock | url = | journal = Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology | volume =  109| issue = | pages =  406–15| pmid = 2360447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first recorded observations of oscillating genes come from the marches of [[Alexander the Great]] in the fourth century B.C.&lt;ref name="Bretzl"&gt;Von Dr. Hugo Bretzl.'Botanische Forschungen des Alexanderzuges.' Leipzig: Teubner. 1903&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, one of Alexander's generals, [[Androsthenes of Thasos|Androsthenes]], wrote that the tamarind tree would open its leaves during the day and close them at nightfall.&lt;ref name="Bretzl"/&gt; Until 1729, the rhythms associated with oscillating genes were assumed to be "passive responses to a cyclic environment".&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Moore, Martin C, Frank M Sulzman, and Charles A Fuller. The Clocks that Time Us: Physiology of the Circadian Timing System. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1729, [[Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan]] demonstrated that the rhythms of a plant opening and closing its leaves continued even when placed somewhere where sunlight could not reach it. This was one of the first indications that there was an active element to the oscillations. In 1923, [[Ingeborg Beling]] published her paper "Über das Zeitgedächtnis der Bienen" ("On the Time Memory of Bees") which extended oscillations to animals, specifically bees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beling | first1 = Ingeborg | year = 1929 | title = Über das Zeitgedächtnis der Bienen | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00340159 | journal = Zeitschrift für vergleichende Physiologie | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 259–338 | doi=10.1007/BF00340159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, [[Ron Konopka|Ronald Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] discovered that mutations of the [[Period (gene)|PERIOD]] gene caused changes in the circadian rhythm of flies under constant conditions. They hypothesized that the mutation of the gene was affecting the basic oscillator mechanism.&lt;ref name="Konopka"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Konopka | first1 = RJ | last2 = Benzer | first2 = Seymour | year = 1971 | title = Clock Mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/68/9/2112.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 68 | issue = 9| pages = 2112–2116 | doi=10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | pmid=5002428 | pmc=389363}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Hardin (chronobiologist)|Paul Hardin]], Jeffrey Hall, and [[Michael Rosbash]] demonstrated that relationship by discovering that within the PERIOD gene, there was a feedback mechanism that controlled the oscillation.&lt;ref name="Hardin" /&gt; The mid-1990s saw an outpouring of discoveries, with [[CLOCK]], [[Cryptochrome|CRY]], and others being added to the growing list of oscillating genes.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson CL, Sancar A (2004).

Boca Raton: CRC Press. pp. 1381–89. {{ISBN|0-8493-1348-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = DP | last2 = Zhao | first2 = Y | last3 = Sangoram | first3 = AM | last4 = Wilsbacher | first4 = LD | last5 = Tanaka | first5 = M | last6 = Antoch | first6 = MP | last7 = Steeves | first7 = TD | last8 = Vitaterna | first8 = MH | last9 = Kornhauser | first9 = JM | last10 = Lowrey | first10 = PL | last11 = Turek | first11 = FW | last12 = Takahashi | first12 = JS | year = 1997 | title = Positional Cloning of the Mouse Circadian Clock Gene | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 4| pages = 641–653 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80245-7 | pmid = 9160755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular circadian mechanisms==

The primary molecular mechanism behind an oscillating gene is best described as a transcription/translation feedback loop.&lt;ref name="reppert"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reppert | first1 = Steven M. | last2 = Weaver | first2 = David R. | year = 2002 | title = Coordination of circadian timing in mammals | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 418 | issue = 6901| pages = 935–941 | doi = 10.1038/nature00965 | pmid = 12198538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This loop contains both positive regulators, which increase gene expression, and negative regulators, which decrease gene expression.&lt;ref name="Kwon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kwon | first1 = I. | last2 = Choe | first2 = HK | last3 = Son | first3 = GH | last4 = Kyungjin | first4 = K | year = 2011 | title = Mammalian Molecular Clocks | journal = Experimental Neurobiology | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 18–28 | doi = 10.5607/en.2011.20.1.18 | pmid = 22110358 | pmc=3213736}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental elements of these loops are found across different phyla. In the mammalian circadian clock, for example, transcription factors [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]] are the positive regulators.&lt;ref name="Kwon" /&gt; CLOCK and BMAL1 bind to the [[E-box]] of oscillating genes, such as Per1, Per2, and Per3 and Cry1 and Cry2, and upregulate their transcription.&lt;ref name="Kwon" /&gt; When the PERs and CRYs form a heterocomplex in the cytoplasm and enter the nucleus again, they inhibit their own transcription.&lt;ref name="gallego"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallego | first1 = M | last2 = Virshup | first2 = DM | year = 2007 | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | url = | journal = Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 139–148 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 | pmid = 17245414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that over time the mRNA and protein levels of PERs and CRYs, or any other oscillating gene under this mechanism, will oscillate.

There also exists a secondary feedback loop, or 'stabilizing loop', which regulates the cyclic expression of Bmal1.&lt;ref name="Kwon" /&gt; This is caused by two nuclear receptors, REV-ERB and ROR,  which suppresses and activates Bmal1 transcription, respectively.&lt;ref name="Kwon" /&gt;

In addition to these feedback loops, post-translational modifications also play a role in changing the characteristics of the circadian clock, such as its period.&lt;ref name="gallego" /&gt; Without any type of feedback repression, the molecular clock would have a period of just a few hours.&lt;ref name="Kwon" /&gt; Casein kinase members CK1ε and CK1δ were both found to be mammalian protein kinases involved in circadian regulation.&lt;ref name="Kwon" /&gt; Mutations in these kinases are associated with familial advanced sleep phase syndrome ([[Advanced sleep phase disorder|FASPS]]).&lt;ref name="Toh"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toh | first1 = KL | last2 = Jones | first2 = CR | last3 = He | first3 = Y | last4 = Eide | first4 = EJ | last5 = Hinz | first5 = WA | last6 = Virshup | first6 = DM | last7 = Ptacek | first7 = LJ | last8 = Fu | first8 = YH | year = 2001 | title = An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep phase syndrome | url = | journal = Science | volume = 291 | issue = | pages = 1040–1043 | pmid = 11232563 | doi=10.1126/science.1057499}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, phosphorylation is necessary for the degradation of PERs via ubiquitin ligases.&lt;ref name="price"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Price | first1 = JL | last2 = Blau | first2 = J | last3 = Rothenfluh | first3 = A | last4 = Abodeely | first4 = M | last5 = Kloss | first5 = B | last6 = Young | first6 = MW | year = 1998 | title = double-time is a novel Drosophila clock gene that regulates PERIOD protein accumulation | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 94 | issue = | pages = 83–95 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81224-6 | pmid = 9674430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, phosphorylation of BMAL1 via CK2 is important for accumulation of BMAL1.&lt;ref name="tamaru"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tamaru | first1 = T | last2 = Hirayama | first2 = J | last3 = Isojima | first3 = Y | last4 = Nagai | first4 = K | last5 = Norioka | first5 = S | last6 = Takamatsu | first6 = K | last7 = Sassone-Corsi | first7 = P | year = 2009 | title = CK2-alpha phosphorylates BMAL1 to regulate the mammalian clock | url = | journal = Nat Struct Mol Biol | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 446–448 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.1578 | pmid = 19330005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The genes provided in this section are only a small number of the vast amount of oscillating genes found in the world. These genes were selected because they were determined to be the some of most important genes in regulating the circadian rhythm of their respective classification.

===Mammalian genes===
* [[Cryptochrome|Cry1]] and [[Cryptochrome|Cry2]] – Cryptochromes are a class of blue light sensitive flavoproteins found in plants and animals. Cry1 and Cry2 code for the proteins CRY1 and CRY2. In ''Drosophila'', CRY1 and CRY2 bind to [[Timeless (gene)|TIM]], a circadian gene that is a component of the transcription-translation negative feedback loop, in a light dependent fashion and blocks its function. In mammals, CRY1 and CRY2 are light independent and function to inhibit the CLOCK-BMAL1 dimer of the circadian clock which regulates cycling of Per1 transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Griffin | first1 = EA | last2 = Staknis | first2 = D | last3 = Weitz | first3 = CJ | year = 1999 | title = Light-independent role of CRY1 and CRY2 in the mammalian circadian clock | url = | journal = Science | volume = 286 | issue = 5440| pages = 768–71 | doi = 10.1126/science.286.5440.768 | pmid = 10531061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ARNTL|Bmal1]] – Bmal1 also known as [[ARNTL]] or Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like, encodes a protein that forms a heterodimer with the CLOCK protein. This heterodimer binds to E-box enhancers found in the promoter regions of many genes such as Cry1 and Cry2 and Per1-3, thereby activating transcription. The resulting proteins translocate back into the nucleus and act as negative regulators by interacting with CLOCK and/or BMAL1 inhibiting transcription.&lt;ref name="reppert" /&gt;
* [[CLOCK|Clock]] – Clock, also known as Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput, is a transcription factor in the circadian pacemaker of mammals. It affects both the persistence and period of circadian rhythms by its interactions with the gene Bmal1. For more information, refer to Bmal1.
* [[Period (gene)|Per]] genes – There are three different per genes, also known as Period genes, (per 1, per 2, and per 3) that are related by sequence in mice. Transcription levels for mPer1 increase in the late night before subjective dawn and is followed by increases in the levels of mPer3 and then by mPer2. mPer1 peaks at CT 4-6, mPer3 at CT 4 and 8 and mPer2 at CT 8.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt; mPer1 is necessary for phase shifts induced by light or glutamate release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akiyama | first1 = M | last2 = Kouzu | first2 = Y | last3 = Takahashi | first3 = S | last4 = Wakamatsu | first4 = H | last5 = Moriya | first5 = T | last6 = Maetani | first6 = M | last7 = Watanabe | first7 = S | last8 = Tei | first8 = H | last9 = Sakaki | first9 = Y | last10 = Shibata | first10 = S | year = 1999 | title = Inhibition of light- or glutamate-induced mPer1 expression represses the phase shifts into the mouse circadian locomotor and suprachiasmatic firing rhythms | url = | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 1115–21 | pmid = 9920673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mPer 2 and mPer3 are involved in resetting the circadian clock to environmental light cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albrecht | first1 = U | last2 = Zheng | first2 = B | last3 = Larkin | first3 = D | last4 = Sun | first4 = ZS | last5 = Lee | first5 = CC | year = 2001 | title = MPer1 and mper2 are essential for normal resetting of the circadian clock | url = | journal = J.

===''Drosophila'' genes===
* Clock – The clock gene in ''Drosophila'' encodes for the CLOCK protein and forms a heterodimer with the protein CYCLE in order to control the main oscillating activity of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name="Hung"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hung | first1 = HC | last2 = Maurer | first2 = C | last3 = Zorn | first3 = D | last4 = Chang | first4 = WL | last5 = Weber | first5 = F | year = 2009 | title = Sequential and compartment-specific phosphorylation controls the life cycle of the circadian CLOCK protein. | url = | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 284 | issue = 35| pages = 23734–42 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M109.025064 | pmid = 19564332 | pmc=2749147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heterodimer binds to the E-box promoter region of both per and tim which causes activation of their respective gene expression. Once protein levels for both PER and TIM have reached a critical point, they too dimerize and interact with the CLOCK-CYCLE heterodimer to prevent it from binding to the E-Box and activating transcription. This negative feedback loop is essential for the functioning and timing of the circadian clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yu | first1 = W | last2 = Zheng | first2 = H | last3 = Houl | first3 = JH | last4 = Dauwalder | first4 = B | last5 = Hardin | first5 = PE | year = 2006 | title = PER-dependent rhythms in CLK phosphorylation and E-box binding regulate circadian transcription | url = | journal = Genes Dev | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 723–33 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1404406 | pmid = 16543224 | pmc=1434787}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cycle (gene)|Cycle]] – the cycle gene encodes for the CYCLE protein to form a heterodimer with the protein CLOCK. The heterodimer creates a transcription-translation feedback loop that controls the levels of both the PER and TIM gene. This feedback loop has been shown to be imperative for both the functioning and timing of the circadian clock in ''Drosophila''. For more information, refer to Clock.&lt;ref name="Hung" /&gt;
* Per – The per gene is a clock gene that encodes for the PER protein in ''Drosophila''. The protein levels and transcription rates of PER demonstrate robust circadian rhythms that peak around CT 16. It creates a heterodimer with TIM to control the circadian rhythm. The heterodimer enters the nucleus in order to inhibit the CLOCK-CYCLE heterodimer which acts as a transcriptional activator for per and tim. This results in an inhibition of the transcription factors of per and tim thereby lowering the respective mRNA levels and protein levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ishida | first1 = N | last2 = Kaneko | first2 = M | last3 = Allada | first3 = R | year = 1999 | title = Biological clocks | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 96 | issue = 16| pages = 8819–20 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.16.8819 | pmid = 10430850 | pmc=33693}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, refer to Clock.
* Timeless – The tim gene encodes for the TIM protein that is critical in circadian regulation in ''Drosophila''. Its protein levels and transcription rates demonstrate a circadian oscillation that peaks at around CT 16. TIM binds to the PER protein to create a heterodimer whose transcription-translation feedback loop controls the periodicity and phase of the circadian rhythms. For more information, refer to Period and Clock.&lt;ref name="Hardin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardin | first1 = P.E. | last2 = Hall | first2 = J.C. | last3 = Rosbash | first3 = M. | year = 1990 | title = Feedback of the Drosophila period gene product on circadian cycling of its messenger RNA levels | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 343 | issue = 6258| pages = 536–40 | doi = 10.1038/343536a0 | pmid = 2105471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungal genes===
* [[Frequency (gene)|Frq]] – The Frq gene, also known as the Frequency gene, encodes central components of an oscillatory loop within the circadian clock in ''[[Neurospora]]''. In the oscillator's feedback loop, frq gives rise to transcripts that encode for two forms of the FRQ protein. Both forms are required for robust rhythmicity throughout the organism. Rhythmic changes in the amount of frq transcript are essential for synchronous activity, and abrupt changes in frq levels reset the clock.&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunlap | first1 = JC | year = 1999 | title = Molecular Bases for Circadian Clocks | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 96 | issue = 2| pages = 271–290 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80566-8 | pmid = 9988221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacterial genes===
* Kai genes – Found in the ''Synechococcus elongatus'', these genes are essential components of the cyanobacterium clock, the leading example of [[bacterial circadian rhythms]]. Kai proteins regulate genome wide gene expression. The oscillation of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of KaiC acts as the pacemaker of the circadian clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nakajima | first1 = M | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2005 | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | url = https://www.sciencemag.org/content/308/5720/414.full | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = | pages = 414–5 | doi=10.1126/science.1108451 | pmid=15831759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant genes===
* CCA1 – The CCA1 gene, also known as Circadian and Clock Associated Gene 1, is a gene that is especially important in maintaining the rhythmicity of plant cellular oscillations. Overexpression, results in the loss of rhythmic expression of clock controlled genes (CCGs), loss of photoperiod control, and loss of rhythmicity in LHY expression. See LHY gene below for more information.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt;
* LHY – The LHY gene, also known as the [[Late Elongated Hypocotyl]] gene, is a gene found in plants that encodes components of mutually regulatory negative feedback loops with CCA1 in which overexpression of either results in dampening of both of their expression. This negative feedback loop affects the rhythmicity of multiple outputs creating a daytime protein complex.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt;
* [[TOC1 gene|Toc1 gene]] – Toc1, also known as Timing of CAB Expression 1 gene, is an oscillating gene found in the plants that is known to control the expression of CAB.  It has been shown to affect the period of circadian rhythms through its repression of transcription factors.  This was found through mutations of toc1 in plants that had shortened period of CAB expression.

'''Perlin noise''' is a type of [[gradient noise]] developed by [[Ken Perlin]] in 1983 as a result of his frustration with the "machine-like" look of [[computer-generated imagery|computer graphics]] at the time.&lt;ref name="ken_powerpoint"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.noisemachine.com/talk1/| title= Making Noise| first= Ken| last= Perlin | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232627/http://www.noisemachine.com/talk1/| deadurl= yes | archive-date= March 3, 2016| website= noisemachine.com| publisher= Ken Perlin| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He formally described his findings in a [[SIGGRAPH]] paper in 1985 called ''An image Synthesizer''.&lt;ref name="Perlin:1985:IS:325165.325247"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perlin|first1=Ken|title=An Image Synthesizer|journal=SIGGRAPH Comput.

Perlin did not apply for any patents on the algorithm, but in 2001 he was granted a patent for the use of 3D+ implementations of [[simplex noise]] for [[texture synthesis]]. Simplex noise has the same purpose, but uses a simpler space-filling grid. Simplex noise alleviates some of the problems with Perlin's "classic noise", among them computational complexity and visually-significant directional artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=6867776 |status=patent |title=Standard for perlin noise |pubdate= |gdate=2005-03-15 |fdate=2001-01-10 |pridate=2001-01-10 |inventor= Kenneth Perlin |invent1= |invent2= |assign1=Kenneth Perlin  |assign2=Wsou Investments LLC |class=G06T11/001  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[Image:Perlin.png|thumb|128px|Perlin noise rescaled and added into itself to create [[fractal noise]].]]
Perlin noise is a [[Procedural generation|procedural]] [[Texture (computer graphics)|texture]] primitive, a type of [[gradient noise]] used by visual effects artists to increase the appearance of realism in [[computer graphics]]. The function has a [[pseudo-random]] appearance, yet all of its visual details are the same size. This property allows it to be readily controllable; multiple scaled copies of Perlin noise can be inserted into mathematical expressions to create a great variety of [[procedural texture]]s. Synthetic textures using Perlin noise are often used in [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] to make computer-generated visual elements – such as object surfaces, fire, smoke, or clouds – appear more natural, by imitating the controlled random appearance of textures in nature.

It is also frequently used to generate textures when memory is extremely limited, such as in [[Demo (computer programming)|demos]], and is increasingly finding use in [[graphics processing unit]]s for [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time graphics]] in [[computer game]]s.

==Development==
Perlin noise resulted from the work of [[Ken Perlin]], who developed it at [[Mathematical Applications Group, Inc.]] (MAGI) for [[Disney]]'s [[computer animated]] [[sci-fi]] motion picture ''[[Tron]]'' (1982). In 1997, he won an [[Academy Award for Technical Achievement]] from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for this contribution to CGI.&lt;ref&gt;Kerman, Phillip. ''Macromedia Flash 8 @work: Projects and Techniques to Get the Job Done.'' Sams Publishing. 2006. {{ISBN|9780672328282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithm detail==
Perlin noise is most commonly implemented as a two-, three- or four-dimensional [[function (mathematics)|function]], but can be defined for any number of dimensions.  An implementation typically involves three steps: grid definition with random gradient vectors, computation of the [[dot product]] between the distance-gradient vectors and interpolation between these values.

===Grid definition===

Define an ''n''-dimensional grid where each point has a random ''n''-dimensional unit-length gradient vector, except in the one dimensional case where the gradients are random scalars between -1 and 1.

Assigning the random gradients in one and two dimensions is trivial using a [[random number generator]].  For higher dimensions a Monte Carlo approach can be used&lt;ref name="ken_powerpoint"/&gt; where random Cartesian coordinates are chosen in a unit cube, points falling outside the unit ball are discarded, and the remaining points are normalized to lie on the unit sphere. The process is continued until the required number of random gradients are obtained.

In order to negate the expensive process of computing new gradients for each grid node, some implementations use a [[Hash table|hash and lookup table]] for a finite number of precomputed gradient vectors.&lt;ref name="libnoise"&gt;[http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/index.html libnoise]&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of a hash also permits the inclusion of a random seed where multiple instances of Perlin noise are required.

===Dot product===

Given an ''n''-dimensional argument for the noise function, the next step in the algorithm is to determine into which grid cell the given point falls.  For each corner node of that cell, the distance vector between the point and the node is determined.  The [[dot product]] between the gradient vector at the node and the distance vector is then computed.

For a point in a two-dimensional grid, this will require the computation of 4 distance vectors and dot products, while in three dimensions 8 distance vectors and 8 dot products are needed.  This leads to the &lt;math&gt;O(2^n)&lt;/math&gt; complexity scaling.

===Interpolation===

The final step is interpolation between the &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; dot products computed at the nodes of the cell containing the argument point. This has the consequence that the noise function returns 0 when evaluated at the grid nodes themselves.

Interpolation is performed using a function that has zero first [[derivative]] (and possibly also second derivative) at the  &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; grid nodes. This has the effect that the [[gradient]] of the resulting noise function at each grid node coincides with the precomputed random gradient vector there. If &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, an example of a function that interpolates between value &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; at grid node 0 and value &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; at grid node 1 is

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + \operatorname{smoothstep}(x)\cdot(a_1-a_0) \ \ \text{for }0\leq x\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[smoothstep]] function was used.

Noise functions for use in computer graphics typically produce values in the range [-1.0,1.0].  In order to produce Perlin noise in this range, the interpolated value may need to be scaled by some scaling factor.&lt;ref name="libnoise"/&gt;

==Implementation==

The following is a two-dimensional implementation of Classical Perlin Noise, written in C++.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cpp"&gt;
// Function to linearly interpolate between a0 and a1
// Weight w should be in the range [0.0, 1.0]
float lerp(float a0, float a1, float w) {
    return (1.0 - w)*a0 + w*a1;

    // as an alternative, this slightly faster equivalent formula can be used:
    // return a0 + w*(a1 - a0);
}

// Computes the dot product of the distance and gradient vectors.
float dotGridGradient(int ix, int iy, float x, float y) {

    // Precomputed (or otherwise) gradient vectors at each grid node
    extern float Gradient[IYMAX][IXMAX][2];

    // Compute the distance vector
    float dx = x - (float)ix;
    float dy = y - (float)iy;

    // Compute the dot-product
    return (dx*Gradient[iy][ix][0] + dy*Gradient[iy][ix][1]);
}

// Compute Perlin noise at coordinates x, y
float perlin(float x, float y) {

    // Determine grid cell coordinates
    int x0 = int(x);
    int x1 = x0 + 1;
    int y0 = int(y);
    int y1 = y0 + 1;

    // Determine interpolation weights
    // Could also use higher order polynomial/s-curve here
    float sx = x - (float)x0;
    float sy = y - (float)y0;

    // Interpolate between grid point gradients
    float n0, n1, ix0, ix1, value;
    n0 = dotGridGradient(x0, y0, x, y);
    n1 = dotGridGradient(x1, y0, x, y);
    ix0 = lerp(n0, n1, sx);
    n0 = dotGridGradient(x0, y1, x, y);
    n1 = dotGridGradient(x1, y1, x, y);
    ix1 = lerp(n0, n1, sx);
    value = lerp(ix0, ix1, sy);

    return value;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Complexity==
For each evaluation of the noise function, the dot product of the position and gradient vectors must be evaluated at each node of the containing grid cell. Perlin noise therefore scales with complexity &lt;math&gt;O(2^n)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensions.  Alternatives to Perlin noise producing similar results with improved complexity scaling include [[simplex noise]] and [[OpenSimplex noise]].

'''Public science''' is an increasingly popular term for research that is conducted amongst, or includes, the [[public]]. Two traditions of public science have emerged, one based on [[participatory action research]] and another based on [[science outreach]].

The [[participatory action research]] approach seeks to develop  a critical framework for making systematic inquiry and analysis a public enterprise. It is committed to valuing knowledges that have been historically marginalized and delegitimized (i.e., youth, prisoner, immigrant, farmer) alongside traditionally recognized knowledges (i.e., scholarly). Through the formation of research collectives, it aims to share the various knowledges and resources held by its individual members so members can participate as equally as possible. The choice of appropriate research questions, design, methods and analysis as well as useful research products are decided collectively. Centres for this form of public science include the  [http://publicscienceproject.org/ Public Science Project] and the Society for Participation, Engagement, Action and Knowledge Sharing. 

Examples of public science projects in the [[participatory action research]] tradition include the [http://morrisjustice.org/ Morris Justice Project] and [http://ourfood.org.uk/ Our Food].

The [[science outreach]] approach has some similarities to [[citizen science]] but typically describes projects that are conducted outdoors or in another type of public or accessible space such as a public park, metro stop, library, university campus, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Arcand, K.K., Watzke, M., “Creating Public Science with the From Earth to the Universe Project” Science Communication. September 2011. 33 (3) http://scx.sagepub.com/content/33/3/398.abstract. &lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to [[public art]], there are aspects of collaboration, community support and involvement, and even site specificity&lt;ref&gt;Watzke, M., Arcand, K.K., “The Universe Brought Down to the Streets: The “From Earth to the Universe” Project”. Mercury magazine. Volume 39 #1. Spring 2010.  (excerpt: http://www.astrosociety.org/pubs/mercury/39_02/watzke.html)&lt;/ref&gt; involved.   

Public science efforts in the [[science outreach]] tradition include Science on the Buses, in which city buses in many major European Union cities were decorated with large informational science posters in November 2002.  Likewise, a project in Toronto placed “advertisements” with science facts on [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/06/busing-in-astronomy/] buses in Toronto during July 2009.

"Science City" is another example of a public science initiative that ran from June 1994 through May 1995. Created by staff and consultants from the New York Hall of Science, "Science City" was an outdoor exhibition that utilized the street, fences, buildings and other public structures in New York City to attract the "non-museum-going" public to the science in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, P.R. &amp; Cutting, J.M., 1996, “The Inside Story of Science City - An Outdoor Public Science Exhibition”. [[Curator: The Museum Journal]]. Volume 39 #4, p.245-261.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition asked questions such as "Why is it warmer in the city?", "What pulses under the street?" and "What's under the sidewalk?" to help increase public awareness about the science and technology that runs invisibly underneath modern urban life. 

[[Science Cafe]]s, founded by the public science pioneer [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/24/duncan-dallas/ Duncan Dallas] are a further public science effort that initiates a discussion on a science topic in pubs or cafes, usually with a local researcher in attendance to answer questions and present information.

[[Science festival]]s can also be grouped into this category of public science efforts, with modern incarnations of festivals including a range of learner-centered activities and events conducted in public spaces. 

Public science initiatives often attempt to reach new audiences (particularly, non-experts who might not actively seek out science), in addition to existing science outreach audiences, by hosting events in alternative [[informal learning]] environments.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P., Lewenstein, B., Shouse, A. W., Feder, M. A.(Eds). 2009, Learning science in informal environments: People, places and pursuits. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, such public science projects are outside the walls of the [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] or [[science museum]], where the main focus of the particular space is not typically science outreach.&lt;ref&gt;Norsted, B. A., 2010, “Take Me Out to the Ball Game: Science Outreach to Non-traditional Audiences” Science Education and Outreach: Forging a Path to the Future. ASP Conference Series, Vol. 431, p.170-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a specific public science initiative in astronomy is “[http://www.fromearthtotheuniverse.org/ From Earth to the Universe]” (FETTU), a project of the [[International Year of Astronomy]] 2009 (IYA2009).&lt;ref&gt;Russo, P. and Christensen, L.L. (Eds.), 2010 “International Year of Astronomy 2009 Final Report” International Astronomical Union, {{ISBN|978-3-923524-65-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; FETTU displayed large-scale images of astronomical objects with contextual information and supplementary materials and activities in non-traditional and mostly public locations such as parks, airports, art festivals, shopping malls, and others (see examples at http://www.fromearthtotheuniverse.org/event_photos.php). By 2011, FETTU had been exhibited at about 1000 sites worldwide, with 50 sites in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Arcand, K.K., Watzke, M., 2010, “Bringing the Universe to the Street: A Preliminary Look at Informal Learning Implications for a Large-Scale Non-traditional Science Outreach Project”. JCOM Journal of Science Communication. Vol. 09, Issue 02, 1. http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/02/Jcom0902%282010%29A01/&lt;/ref&gt; One result from FETTU demonstrated a trend towards more non-self-selective audiences for science communications in these public spaces.

'''Punctuated equilibrium in social theory''' is a method of understanding change in complex social systems. The method studies the evolution of  policy change,&lt;ref name=Baumgartner1993&gt;Baumgartner, Frank and Bryan D. Jones (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0WtEOcK_Y8wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Agendas and Instability in American Politics]''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; including the evolution of conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Cioffi-Revilla, Claudio (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Dr2xTy8NuHcC&amp;pg=PA64 "The political uncertainty of interstate rivalries: A punctuated equilibrium model."] In Paul Diehl ''The Dynamics of Enduring Rivalries''.  Chicago: University of Illinois Press, pp. 64-97.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory suggests that most social systems exist in an extended period of stasis, which are later punctuated by sudden shifts in radical change. The theory was largely inspired from the biological theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] developed by paleontologists [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

The punctuated equilibrium model of policy change was first presented by Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones in 1993,&lt;ref name=Baumgartner1993 /&gt; and has increasingly received attention in [[historical institutionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierson, Paul. (2004). ''Politics in Time: History, Institutions, and Social Analysis''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The model states that policy generally changes only incrementally due to several restraints, namely the "stickiness" of institutional cultures, vested interests, and the [[bounded rationality]] of individual decision-makers. Policy change will thus be punctuated by changes in these conditions, especially in party control of [[government]], or changes in [[public opinion]]. Thus policy is characterized by long periods of stability, punctuated by large—though less frequent—changes due to large shifts in society or government. This has been particularly evident in current trends of [[environmental policy|environmental]] and [[energy policy]]. [[Gun control]] and U.S. [[Tobacco smoking|federal tobacco]] policy have also been found to follow punctuated changes. A 2017 study demonstrates that these patterns are also found in policy-making by international organizations, such as the United Nations or the African Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|last2=Squatrito|first2=Theresa|last3=Tallberg|first3=Jonas|date=2017|title=Stability and change in international policy-making: A punctuated equilibrium approach|journal=Review of International Organizations|volume=13|issue=4|pages=547–572|doi=10.1007/s11558-017-9288-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study by Michael Givel found that despite a significant mobilization to change state tobacco policy, U.S. state tobacco policymaking from 1990 to 2003 was not characterized by punctuated policy change, which also favored the pro-tobacco policy agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Givel, Michael (2006).

Connie Gersick's research on the evolution of organizational systems (1988, 1991) revealed patterns of change mirroring those in biological species. Gersick examined models of change in six domains - developmental patterns of adults, [[group development|group]]s and organizations, the history of science, physical science, and biological evolution - and found evidence for punctuated equilibria (as opposed to steady, incremental change) across those disparate systems.&lt;ref&gt;Gersick, Connie (1991).

The Academy of Management Review 16(1): 10-36&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of the theory have been in  [[Organizational studies|organizational theory]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael L. Tushman|Tushman, M.

Wheelan, and R. Moreland (2004). "Time, change, and development: The temporal perspective on groups." ''Small Group Research'' 35 (1): 73-105.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, social scientific applications of the punctuated equilibrium concept have been criticized for losing sight of a core idea in the original biological theory of punctuated equilibrium: the notion that geographic location plays a significant role in determining which populations are subject to abrupt changes at a given time.&lt;ref name=TilcsikMarquis /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4537">In [[mathematical optimization]], a '''quadratically constrained quadratic program''' ('''QCQP''') is an [[optimization problem]] in which both the [[objective function]] and the [[constrained optimization|constraints]] are [[quadratic function]]s. It has the form

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \text{minimize} &amp;&amp; \tfrac12 x^\mathrm{T} P_0 x + q_0^\mathrm{T} x \\
&amp; \text{subject to} &amp;&amp; \tfrac12 x^\mathrm{T} P_i x + q_i^\mathrm{T} x + r_i \leq 0 \quad \text{for } i = 1,\dots,m , \\
&amp;&amp;&amp; Ax = b, 
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip; ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are ''n''-by-''n'' matrices and ''x'' &amp;isin; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the optimization variable.

If ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip; ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are all [[Positive-definite matrix|positive semidefinite]], then the problem is [[Convex set|convex]]. If these matrices are neither positive nor negative semidefinite, the problem is non-convex. If ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip; ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are all zero, then the constraints are in fact [[Linear map|linear]] and the problem is a [[quadratic program]].

== Hardness ==
Solving the general case is an [[NP-hard]] problem. To see this, note that the two constraints ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − 1) &amp;le; 0 and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − 1) &amp;ge; 0 are equivalent to the constraint ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − 1) = 0, which is in turn equivalent to the constraint ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; {0, 1}. Hence, any [[0–1 integer program]] (in which all variables have to be either 0 or 1) can be formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program. Since 0–1 integer programming is NP-hard in general, QCQP is also NP-hard.

== Relaxation ==
There are two main relaxations of QCQP: using [[semidefinite programming]] (SDP), and using the [[reformulation-linearization technique]] (RLT).

=== Semidefinite programming ===
When ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip; ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are all [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-definite matrices]], the problem is [[Convex optimization|convex]] and can be readily solved using [[interior point method]]s, as done with [[semidefinite programming]].

== Example ==
[[Cut (graph theory)|Max Cut]] is a problem in graph theory, which is NP-hard. Given a graph, the problem is to divide the vertices in two sets, so that as many edges as possible go from one set to the other. Max Cut can be formulated as a QCQP, and SDP relaxation of the dual provides good lower bounds.

==Terminology==
The term draws a comparison with the [[mandala]] of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] [[Mount Meru|worldview]]; the comparison emphasises the radiation of power from each power center, as well as the non-physical basis of the system.

The terminology was revived two millenniums later as a result of Twentieth Century efforts to comprehend patterns of diffuse but coherent political power. [[Metaphors]] such as [[social anthropologist]] [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah|Tambiah]]'s idea of a "galactic polity",&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah|Tambiah, Stanley Jeyaraja]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5755">''S4000P - International specification for developing and continuously improving preventive maintenance'' is a specification developed jointly by a multinational team from the [[Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe]] (ASD) and [[Aerospace Industries Association]] (AIA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia-aerospace.org/national_aerospace_standards/s-series_ils_specifications/ S-Series ILS specifications]&lt;/ref&gt; S4000P is part of the [[S-Series of ILS specifications]] and is integrated in the global ILS process defined by [[SX000i - International guide for the use of the S-Series of Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) specifications]].

The main purpose of this specification is to assist all parties, including regulatory authorities, involved in the analysis process developing and releasing initial PMTR and intervals for new products prior entry into service. S4000P analysis methodologies remain applicable for later optimizations/modifications of the product design and/or of product structure and/or of product zones. 
Once developed, authorized and packaged into interval clusters in a product OMP, the S4000P In-Service Maintenance Optimization (ISMO) process enables continuously improving product maintenance during its in-service phase.

Every development or improvement of a preventive maintenance task requirement for a product supports at least one of the following aspects:
* ensure/maintain product safety, including safety/emergency systems and/or emergency equipment
* avoid any conflict with law and/or significant impact on environmental integrity (ecological damage) during product mission/operation and/or maintenance
* optimize mission/operational capability/availability of the Product
* optimize product economy (Life Cycle Costs = LCC)

==Rationale for S4000P==

For a new product or for a new product variant, the maintainability of the intended product design must be assessed by maintainability specialists providing engineering support. Accumulated in-service experience with other products must also be taken into account.
In parallel to the product design process, Preventive Maintenance Task Requirements (PMTR) with intervals and/or redesign requirements must be assessed on an analytical basis and be determined if applicable and effective. Results must be available prior to product development milestones, latest prior to the Critical Design Review (CDR) for the product.

According to the overall ASD scope, the specification S4000P must cover all types of products including any complex technical platform, system, equipment or facility (e.g. on air/sea/land, under the sea-/ground-level, in space).
The S4000P analysis methodologies allow a structured, traceable and complete determination of PMTR with intervals for a product, which become the basis to elaborate and document a product maintenance program/Operators' Maintenance Program (OMP) prior to starting the product in-service phase.

During the product in-service phase, S4000P provides an additional process that allows reviewing the completeness and effectiveness of preventive maintenance tasks from a product OMP, taking into account product in-service experience and the state-of-the-art analysis methodologies. Such a review of the OMP is to be fully traceable and applicable for all products types.

Every S4000P analysis methodology or process must be tailored for the product under analysis in an analysis guideline or handbook to be acceptable to regulatory authorities (if involved), maintainers, operators, manufacturers and suppliers.

==S4000P main advantages and innovations==

S4000P builds on the know-how accumulated over many years on different maintenance analysis techniques such as [[Reliability-centered maintenance]] but has simplified and extended to those methodologies:
* In comparison to other known analysis methodologies, the application of ASD S4000P is not limited to any pre-defined product type, like military or civil aircraft only. The S4000P analysis principles are developed by industry to be applicable to any complex technical product. This comprises products in air, on ground, under the ground, on sea, under the sea level or even in space for civil and/or military usage. 
* To cover the whole product life cycle, S4000P provides the innovative ISMO methodology to prove and optimize the product maintenance during its complete in-service life. This is in addition to the product maintainability analysis that has to take place during the design and development phase to provide engineering/design support. 
* When defining preventive maintenance task requirements, the S4000P product system analysis takes into account product-integrated test- and condition monitoring technology being widely used in modern products. 
* The S4000P product structure analysis covers all kind of existing and future product structure materials and material combinations. 
* The S4000P product zonal analysis is based on a modular analysis concept to cover the zonal analysis of all kind of product types.

==S4000P development==

S4000P development work started in 2013.

European experts from the following international companies and organizations have participated in the developed S4000P:
* [[Airbus Defence and Space]] (Germany/Spain)
* [[Airbus Helicopters]] (Germany/France)
* [[BAe Systems]] (United Kingdom)
* [[Dassault Aviation]]	France
* Logistics Command of the [[Bundeswehr]] (Germany)
* LSC Group Ltd. (United Kingdom)
* [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)]]

'''Hakim Abul-Majd Majdūd ibn Ādam Sanā'ī Ghaznavi''' ({{lang-fa|حکیم ابوالمجد مجدود ‌بن آدم سنایی غزنوی}}) was a [[Persian language|Persian]] poet from [[Ghazni]] who lived in Ghazni between the 11th century and the 12th century in what is now [[Afghanistan]]. He died between 1131 and 1141.&lt;ref&gt;C.E. Bosworth, ''The Later Ghaznavids'', 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Sanai was a [[Sunni]] Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward G. Browne]], ''A Literary History of Persia from the Earliest Times Until Firdawsh'', 543 pp., Adamant Media Corporation, 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-4021-6045-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4021-6045-5}} (see p.437)&lt;/ref&gt; He was connected with the court of the [[Ghaznavid]] [[Bahram-Shah of Ghazna|Bahram-shah]] who ruled 1117 – 1157.&lt;ref&gt;Ghulam Abbas Dalal, ''Ethics in Persian Poetry''. (Abhinav Publications, 1995), 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He wrote an enormous quantity of mystical verse, of which ''The Walled Garden of Truth'' or ''The Hadiqat al Haqiqa'' (حدیقه الحقیقه و شریعه الطریقه) is his master work and the first Persian mystical epic of Sufism. Dedicated to [[Bahram-Shah of Ghazna|Bahram Shah]], the work expresses the poet's ideas on God, love, philosophy and reason.&lt;ref&gt;"Sanāʾī." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 15 Jul. 2008 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521711/Sanai&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

For close to 900 years ''The Walled Garden of Truth'' has been consistently read as a classic and employed as a [[Sufi]] textbook. According to Major T. Stephenson: "Sanai’s fame has always rested on his ''Hadiqa''; it is the best known and in the East by far the most esteemed of his works; it is in virtue of this work that he forms one of the great trio of Sufi teachers — Sanai, [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]], [[Jalaluddin Rumi]]."  Sanai taught that lust, greed and emotional excitement stood between humankind and divine knowledge, which was the only true reality (''Haqq'').  Love (''Ishq'') and a social conscience are for him the foundation of religion; mankind is asleep, living in a desolate world. To Sanai common religion was only habit and ritual.

Sanai's poetry had a tremendous influence upon [[Persian literature]].  He is considered the first poet to use the ''[[qasidah]]'' (ode), ''[[ghazal]]'' (lyric), and the ''masnavi'' (rhymed couplet) to express the philosophical, mystical and ethical ideas of [[Sufism]].

== Influence and legacy ==

=== Poetic influence ===
[[Rumi]] acknowledged Sanai and [[Attar Neyshapuri|Attar]] as his two great inspirations, saying, "[[Attar Neyshapuri|Attar]] is the soul and Sanai its two eyes, I came after Sanai and Attar." ''The Walled Garden of Truth'' was also a model for [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]]'s ''Makhzan al-Asrar'' (Treasury of Secrets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;blockquote&gt;The Ḥadiqat al-ḥaqiqa is not only one of the first of a long line of Persian didactical maṯnawis, it is also one of the most popular works of its kind as the great number of copies made throughout the centuries attest. Its great impact on Persian literature is evidenced by the numerous citations from the poem occurring in mystical as well as profane works. It has been taken as a model by several other poets, including Neẓāmi, ʿAṭṭār, Rumi, Awḥadi, and Jāmi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern cultural references ===
There is a reference to Hakim Sanai's poetry near the end of the 2017 film ''[[The Shape of Water]]'' by [[Guillermo del Toro]]. In the final scene of the movie, the narrator recites a few verses of poetry without specific attribution, although there is a reference in the film's credit sequence to "Adapted works by Hakim Sanai." Researching for the [[Library of Congress]] blog ''From the Catbird Seat'', Peter Armenti confirmed with the assistance of ''Catbird'' blog readers that the poem spoken at the end of ''The Shape of Water'' is del Toro's adaptation of Priya Hemenway's translation of an original poem by Hakim Sanai. Hemenway's translation appears in ''The Book of Everything: Journey of the Heart’s Desire : Hakim Sanai’s Walled Garden of Truth'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.loc.gov/catbird/2018/03/who-wrote-the-poem-at-the-end-of-the-shape-of-water/|title=Who wrote the poem at the end of "The Shape of Water"? {{!}} From the Catbird Seat: Poetry &amp; Literature at the Library of Congress|date=2018-03-09|website=blogs.loc.gov|language=en-US|others=Armenti, Peter|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==

* Sanai's poetry stresses the possibility of an "awakening";

''While mankind remains mere baggage in the world&lt;br&gt;
''It will be swept along, as in a boat, asleep.&lt;br&gt;
''What can they see in sleep?&lt;br&gt;
''What real merit or punishment can there be?''

* He who knows not his own soul, how shall he know the soul of another? and he who only knows hand and foot, how shall he know the Godhead? The prophets are unequal to understanding this matter; why dost thou foolishly claim to do so? When thou hast brought forward a demonstration of this subject, then thou wilt know the pure essence of the faith; otherwise what have faith and thou in common? thou hadst best be silent, and speak not folly. The learned talk nonsense all; for true religion is not woven about the feet of everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Source: From: Enclosed Garden Of Truth, Edited and translated by [[John Stephenson (zoologist)|J. Stephenson]] in 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

His means for this awakening is surrender to God, his poetry has been called "the essential fragrance of the path of love". He hits out at human hypocrisy and folly;&lt;ref&gt;Osho, ''Unio Mystica'', Vol 1, Chapter 1, Rajneesh Foundation International&lt;/ref&gt;

*Others are heedless,—do thou be wise, and on this path keep thy tongue silent. The condition laid on such a one is that he should receive all food and drink from the Causer, not from the causes. Go, suffer hardship, if thou wouldst be cherished; and if not, be content with the road to Hell. None ever attained his object without enduring hardship.&lt;ref&gt;Source: From: Enclosed Garden Of Truth, Edited and translated by J. Stephenson in 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14267">'''School-related gender-based violence in Viet Nam''' refers to [[Violence|physical]], [[Sexual violence|sexual]], psychosocial and [[Verbal abuse|verbal violence]] that takes place in the [[Education in Vietnam|Vietnamese education system]]. Different forms of [[School-related gender-based violence|School-related gender-based violence (SRGBV)]] interact and overlap. Bullying, for instance, occurs when there is an imbalance of power between the “bully” and the “bullied” and can happen through physical contact, verbal attacks, social exclusion, and psychological manipulation. Students are bullied when they are repeatedly and intentionally exposed to harmful and/or aggressive behaviour that results in injury or discomfort.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246928e.pdf|title=Reaching Out: Preventing and Addressing SOGIE-related School Violence in Viet Nam, volume 2|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=15, 21, 27-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scale ==
Global, regional and local research demonstrates that schools and other educational institutions in Viet Nam are not always safe and inclusive spaces for children and young people. Many schools are sites of physical, verbal, psychosocial and sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Pinheiro P. (2006). World Report on Violence against Children.

== Studies ==
In 2013 the Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) showed that approximately one in six students, aged 13-17 years, reported being in a physical fight one or more times during the last 12 months, with this behaviour being more common for boys (26%) than girls (10%).&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation &amp; Hanoi Medical University. (2013). Global School-based Student Health Survey: Vietnam 2013 Fact Sheet. Hanoi: WHO. &lt;/ref&gt; Reported experiences of bullying, one or more days within the last 30 days, were however similar for boys and girls (23% and 24% respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Quang Dao, V.

School Violence in Hanoi, Vietnam. Singapore National University. &lt;/ref&gt;

Viet Nam has also had some research studies about violence against LGBT students, including a field survey carried out by CCIHP with 520 LGBT people with the average age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;Hershberger, S. L., &amp; D’Augelli, A. R. (1995). The impact of victimization on the mental health and suicidality of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths. Developmental Psychology, 31, 65–74. &lt;/ref&gt; This study revealed that 41% of LGBT participants suffered from discrimination and violence in either schools or universities. [[Save the Children]] Vietnam and the Institute of Social and Medical Studies completed a separate study on 170 LGBT young adults which found that discrimination against these children (at home and school) contributed to their increased risk of homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children. (2015). Child Rights Situation Analysis. Ha Noi: Viet Nam Country Office. &lt;/ref&gt; They were at high risk of violence at home, school and on the streets. Only 15.9% of the LGBT youth participants had a post-secondary school education, 47.8% had only a lower secondary education, 27.6% had only a primary school education, and 8.7% had no schooling at all.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One study conducted by the Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and Environment (iSEE) involving 2,363 respondents from 63 provinces in Viet Nam found that one in three respondents felt that they had been subject to discrimination because of their sexual orientation and gender identity within 12 months preceding the survey, with a high degree of frequency.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Luong,T.H.,&amp;Pham,Q,P.(2015).Is it because I am LGBT?: Discriminations on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Vietnam. Ha Noi: The Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and Environment. &lt;/ref&gt; The study also reported that transgender people experience the highest degree of discrimination. This study focused its analysis on the discrimination experienced by LGBT people in families, schools, workplaces, healthcare settings and housing, among other aspects. Looking specifically at the school setting, the study found that nearly a quarter of students had been harassed, bullied by teachers and/or school officials because they were considered to be LGBT. Gender indicative uniforms proved to be a significant obstacle for transgender people, affecting their quality of learning and their mental health. In light of the findings, some recommendations specific to the education sector included: 1) School psychological counseling models need to pre-empt the psychological and physical development of students to provide well-timed educational support; 2) Create extracurricular programs that respond to the needs of students; 3) Respect students’ choice of uniform to fit with their desired gender and; 4) Educate faculties about the LGBT community.

[[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan International]] Viet Nam, in cooperation with the Ha Noi Department of Education and Training (DOET), [[Center for Research and Applied Sciences in Gender, Family, Women and Adolescents]] [[(CSAGA)]], and the [[International Center for Research on Women|International Centre for Research on Women]] (ICRW), has implemented a “Gender Responsive School Pilot Model project” meant to prevent and respond to SRGBV. The 3-year project (2014-2016), funded by UNTF and Plan International involves 20 secondary/high schools in Ha Noi. The intervention provides teacher training on gender equality, SRGBV, and reproductive health to encourage lessons on related topics to be integrated into the curriculum. The intervention also encourages the formation of youth leadership organizations and awareness-raising activities with parents. A key component of the project is the establishment of a psychological counselling room at the participating schools. To date, nearly 2,300 students have received individualized counselling and over 4,100 students have received group counselling. The project has found that while only 6% of students in Viet Nam know about a public hotline for counselling, 21% of the total students in the 20 schools of the project have sought counselling services.&lt;ref&gt;Plan International Viet Nam.

== Prevention ==
The National Policy Framework for Gender Equality was approved for the period 2011-2020 with the goal of highlighting the importance of gender equality for the socio-economic development of the country, including in education efforts towards this end. Furthermore, unlike many of its neighbours, Viet Nam now no longer has a ban on same-sex marriage, and has indeed never had punitive laws around either male or female same-sex relations.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, R. (2015). Vietnam Removes Same-Sex Marriage Ban. Metro Weekly. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.metroweekly.com/2015/01/&lt;/nowiki&gt; vietnam-removes-same-sex-marriage- &lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Viet Nam passed a landmark law by a vote of 282-84 in 2015 enshrining transgender people’s right to legal recognition of a gender identity other than that indicated by their sex rights for transgender people and paving the way to allow those who have undergone gender reassignment to register their legal identity under their new sex.&lt;ref&gt;Wee, D.

Retrieved from http:// www.gaystarnews.com/article/vietnam- passes-landmark-law-recognizing-transgender- people/#gs.UibaoY0 &lt;/ref&gt; Along with these strategies, a National Targeted Program on Gender Equality was developed for the period of 2011 to 2015 and as Viet Nam moves forward with new strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, there is a clear opportunity for evaluation and reflection on current conditions around SOGIE in education.&lt;ref&gt;Pistor, N., &amp; Quy, L.

'''Sexual objectification''' is the act of treating a person as a mere [[Object (philosophy)|object]] of [[sexual desire]]. [[Objectification]] more broadly means treating a person as a [[commodity]] or an object without regard to their [[personality]] or [[dignity]]. Objectification is most commonly examined at the level of a society, but can also refer to the behavior of individuals and is a type of [[dehumanization]].

The concept of sexual objectification and, in particular, the objectification of [[woman|women]], is an important idea in feminist theory and psychological theories derived from [[feminism]]. Many feminists regard sexual objectification as playing an important role in [[gender inequality]]. Psychologists associate objectification with a host of physical and mental health risks in women.

Female sexual objectification by a male involves a woman being viewed primarily as an object of male sexual desire, rather than as a whole person.&lt;ref name=Barry&gt;{{cite book |last=Barry |first=Kathleen |contribution=Pornography: the ideoloy of cultural sadism |editor-last=Barry |editor-first=Kathleen |title=Female sexual slavery |page=247 |publisher=NYU Press |location=New York London |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-8147-1069-2 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LeMoncheck&gt;{{cite book |last=LeMoncheck |first=Linda |contribution=I only do it for the money: pornography, prostitution, and the business of sex |editor-last=LeMoncheck |editor-first=Linda |title=Loose women, lecherous men a feminist philosophy of sex |page=133 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-510556-8 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Szymanski |first1=Dawn M. |last2=Moffitt |first2=Lauren B. |last3=Carr |first3=Erika R. |title=Sexual objectification of women: advances to theory and research |journal=[[The Counseling Psychologist]] |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=6–38 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|Sage]] |doi=10.1177/0011000010378402 |date=January 2011  |ref=harv |postscript=.|url=http://www.apa.org/education/ce/sexual-objectification.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although opinions differ as to which situations are objectionable, many feminists&lt;ref name=Jhally&gt;{{cite AV media |last=Jhally |first=Sut (director) |author-link=Sut Jhally |date=1997 |title=Dreamworlds II: desire, sex, power in music |medium=Documentary |location=USA |publisher=[[Media Education Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; see objectification of women taking place in the sexually oriented depictions of women in advertising, art and media, [[pornography]] where women are only portrayed as weak or submissive, the occupations of [[Striptease|stripping]] and [[prostitution]], men brazenly evaluating or judging women sexually or aesthetically in public spaces and events, such as beauty contests.

Pro-feminist cultural critics such as [[Robert W.

The objection to the objectification of women is not a recent phenomenon. In the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], for example, there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift. In [[Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy]]'s 1771 play ''The True Mother'' (''La Vraie Mère''), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts &amp;ndash; the respectable treasures of nature &amp;ndash; as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schama |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Schama |contribution=The cultural construction of a citizen: II Casting roles: children of nature |editor-last=Schama |editor-first=Simon |editor-link=Simon Schama |title=[[Citizens.

The issues concerning sexual objectification became first [[problematization|problemized]] during the 1970s by feminist groups. Since then, it has been argued that the phenomenon of female sexual objectification has increased drastically since its problematization in all levels of life, and has resulted in negative consequences for women, especially in the political sphere. However, a rising form of new third-waver feminist groups have also taken the increased objectification of women as an opportunity to use the female body as a mode of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Heldman | first = Caroline | title = Sexualizing Sarah Palin: the social and political context of the sexual objectification of female candidates | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 156&amp;ndash;164 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s11199-011-9984-6 | date = August 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-011-9984-6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ariel Levy (journalist)|Ariel Levy]] contends that Western women who exploit their sexuality by, for example, wearing revealing clothing and engaging in lewd behavior, engage in female self-objectification, meaning they objectify themselves. While some women see such behaviour as a form of [[empowerment]], Levy contends that it has led to greater emphasis on a physical criterion or [[sexualization]] for women's perceived self-worth, which Levy calls "[[Raunch aesthetics|raunch culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Ariel |author-link=Ariel Levy (journalist) |title=[[Female Chauvinist Pigs|Female chauvinist pigs: women and the rise of raunch culture]] |publisher=Pocket Books |location=London |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4165-2638-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy discusses this phenomenon in ''[[Female Chauvinist Pigs]]: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture''. Levy followed the camera crew from the ''[[Girls Gone Wild (franchise)|Girls Gone Wild]]'' video series, and argues that contemporary America's sexualized culture not only objectifies women, it encourages women to objectify themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article2523264.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=Yes we are bovvered |first=Ginny |last=Dougary |date=25 September 2007 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's culture, Levy writes, the idea of a woman participating in a wet T-shirt contest or being comfortable watching explicit [[pornography]] has become a symbol of feminist strength.

==Sexual objectification of men==
[[Feminist]] authors [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] and [[Naomi Wolf]] write that women's sexual liberation led women to a [[role reversal]], whereby they viewed men as sex objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Sommers |first=Christina |author-link=Sommers, Christina Hoff |contribution=The gender wardens |title-link=Who Stole Feminism?

=== Media ===
Men's bodies have become more objectified than they previously were. It is known as "Six-pack Advertising," where men are seen as sexual objects. Because of society's established gaze on the objectification of women, the newfound objectification of men is not as widespread. Even with this increase of male objectification, males are still seen as the dominant figures and so the focus is still primarily on women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Tortajada-Giménez |first1= Iolanda |last2= Araüna-Baró |first2= Núria | last3 = Martínez-Martínez | first3 = Inmaculada José | title = Advertising stereotypes and gender representation in social networking sites | journal = Comunicar | volume = 21 | issue = 41 | pages = 177&amp;ndash;186 | publisher = Grupo Comunicar | date = 2013 | url = https://www.revistacomunicar.com/indice-en/articulo.php?numero=41-2013-17 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://doi.org/10.3916/C41-2013-17 Original Spanish article.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Male sexual objectification has been found in 37% of advertisements featuring men's body parts to showcase a product.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = M.

Similar to the issues of sexual objectification in women, it is common for said objectification to lead men to body shaming, eating disorders, and a drive for perfection. Men in the media are especially pressured to take part in steroid use in order to meet the standard of beauty set by body evaluation. The continued exposure of these "ideal" men subject society to expect all men to fit this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Buchbinder | first = David | author-link = David Buchbinder | title = Object or ground?

Male actors featured in TV shows and movies are oftentimes in excellent shape and have the "ideal" bodies. These men often fill the leading roles. When society is subjected to men who do not have ideal bodies, we typically see them as the comic relief. It is rare to see an out of shape man have a leading role. "There are temporal, cultural and geographical ‘norms’ of gender and other aspects of identity, which are often incorrectly considered to be inherent or natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dawson | first = Leanne | title = Passing and policing: controlling compassion, bodies and boundaries in ''Boys Don’t Cry'' and ''Unveiled/Fremde Haut'' | journal = Studies in European Cinema | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 205&amp;ndash;228 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/17411548.2015.1094258 | date = 2015 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17411548.2015.1094258 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the media, the ideal version of a man is seen as a strong, toned man. The idealized version of a woman is thin (Aubrey, pg. 7). The concept of body evaluation is more common in criticizing women. However, body evaluation revolves more towards nonverbal cues for men. It is more common in women because sexual, sometimes offensive, verbal remarks are directed towards women. Men, on the other hand, experience more body evaluation through gazing and other nonverbal cues. Gazing is simply the way in which depict men from an idealized perspective. Men tend to experience this from other men, whereas women experience it from both sexes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The Interpersonal Sexual Objectification Scale (ISOS) is a scale that shows sexual objectification of respondents, both men and women. While experiencing sexual objectification it creates the need to constantly maintain and critique one’s physical appearance. This leads to other things like eating disorders, body shaming, and anxiety. The ISOS scale can be related to objectification theory and sexism.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Self-objectification, which is the way in which we evaluate ourselves, is concentrated more on women.  Men typically experience it through media display.  The difference is that men typically do not experience the negative effects to the extent that women do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stevens Aubrey | first = Jennifer |title=Investigating the role of self-objectification in the relationship between media exposure and sexual self-perceptions | url = http://www.icahdq.org/page/PastFuture | date = 27 May 2003 }} Paper presented at the annual meeting of the [[International Communication Association]], Marriott Hotel, San Diego, CA, May 27, 2003.

==Views on sexual objectification==
{{see also|Gaze}}
While the concept of sexual objectification is important within feminist theory, ideas vary widely on what constitutes sexual objectification and what are the ethical implications of such objectification. Some feminists such as [[Naomi Wolf]] find the concept of [[physical attractiveness]] itself to be problematic,&lt;ref name=beautymyth&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |author-link=Naomi Wolf |title=The beauty myth: how images of beauty are used against women |publisher=Perennial |location=New York |year=2002 |origyear=1992 |isbn=978-0-06-051218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some [[radical feminists]]  being opposed to any evaluation of another person's sexual attractiveness based on physical characteristics.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs references to reliable sources|date=September 2015}} [[John Stoltenberg]] goes so far as to condemn as wrongfully objectifying any sexual fantasy that involves the visualization of a woman.&lt;ref name=stoltenberg&gt;{{cite book |last=Stoltenberg |first=John |author-link=John Stoltenberg | chapter = Sexual objectification and male supremacy |chapter-url=http://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Stoltenberg-Refusing-to-be-a-Man.pdf |title=Refusing to be a man: essays on sex and justice |publisher=UCL Press |location=London New York | page = 38 |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-84142-041-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical feminists view objectification as playing a central role in reducing women to what they refer to as the "oppressed sex [[Social class|class]]".{{Cite quote|date=September 2015}} While some feminists view mass media in societies that they argue are [[patriarchal]] to be objectifying, they often focus on [[pornography]] as playing an egregious role in habituating men to objectify women.&lt;ref name='MacKinnon "Only Words"'&gt;{{cite book |last=MacKinnon |first=Catharine |author-link=Catharine MacKinnon |title=Only words |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-674-63934-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[social conservatives]] have taken up aspects of the [[feminist]] critique of sexual objectification. In their view however, the increase in the sexual objectification of both sexes in Western culture is one of the negative legacies of the [[sexual revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dr. James Dobson |url=http://www.theinterim.com/issues/society-culture/dr-james-dobson-6 |work=The Interim: Canada's life and family newspaper |location=[[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada |publisher=via [[True Media]] |date=12 January 1997 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shalit1&gt;{{cite book |last=Shalit |first=Wendy |author-link=Wendy Shalit |title=A return to modesty: discovering the lost virtue |publisher=Touchstone |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-684-86317-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reisman |first=Judith A. |author-link=Judith Reisman |title="Soft porn" plays hardball: its tragic effects on women, children, and the family |publisher=Huntington House Publishers |location=[[Lafayette, Louisiana]] |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-910311-92-2 |pages=32–46, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holz |first=Adam R. |title=Is average the new ugly? |url=http://www.pluggedin.com/familyroom/articles/2007/isaveragethenewugly.aspx |work=[[Plugged In|Plugged In Online]] |publisher=[[Focus on the Family]] |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=National Coalition for the Protection of Children &amp; Families |url=http://pureintimacy.org/piArticles/A000000551.cfm |title=Subtle Dangers of Pornography (special report by the National Coalition for the Protection of Children &amp; Families) |work=Pure Intimacy (website) |publisher=[[Focus on the Family]] |date=July 1997 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics, notably [[Wendy Shalit]], advocate a return to pre-sexual revolution standards of [[sexual morality]], which Shalit refers to as a "return to [[modesty]]", as an antidote to sexual objectification.&lt;ref name=shalit1/&gt;&lt;ref name=shalit2&gt;{{cite web |last=Shalit |first=Wendy |author-link=Wendy Shalit |title=Modesty revisited |url=http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles/ShalitModesty.php |website=orthodoxytoday.org |publisher=[[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America|Fr.

Others contest feminist claims about the objectification of women. [[Camille Paglia]] holds that "[t]urning people into sex objects is one of the specialties of our species." In her view, objectification is closely tied to (and may even be identical with) the highest human faculties toward conceptualization and [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paglia |first=Camille |author-link=Camille Paglia |title=[[Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson|Sexual personae: art and decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]] |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-679-73579-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Individualist feminist]] [[Wendy McElroy]] says, given that  'objectification' of women means to make women into sexual objects; it is meaningless because, 'sexual objects', taken literally, means nothing because inanimate objects do not have sexuality. She continues that women are their bodies as well as their minds and souls, and so focusing on a single aspect should not be "degrading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McElroy |first=Wendy |author-link=Wendy McElroy |title=A feminist overview of pornography, ending in a defense thereof |url=http://www.wendymcelroy.com/freeinqu.htm |website=WendyMcElroy.com |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectification theory==
{{expert needed|Feminism|ex2=Gender Studies|section|reason=The prose is jargon-filled, repetitive and nearly impenetrable to laypeople. The structure needs improvement|date=January 2015}}
Objectification theory is a framework for understanding the experiences of women in cultures that sexual objectify them, proposed by Barbara Fredrickson and Tomi-Ann Roberts in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, B. L., &amp; Roberts, T. (1997). Objectification Theory. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 21(2), 173-206. Retrieved September 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this framework, Fredrickson and Roberts draw conclusions about women’s experiences. This theory states that, because of sexual objectification, women learn to internalize an outsider’s view of their bodies as the primary view of themselves. Women, they explain, begin to view their bodies as objects separate from their person. This internalization has been termed self-objectification. This theory doesn’t seek to prove the existence of sexual objectification; the theory assumes its existence in culture. This self-objectification then, according to objectification theory, leads to increased habitual body monitoring. With this framework in mind, Fredrickson and Roberts suggest explanations for consequences they believe are the result of sexual objectification. The consequences suggested are: increased feelings of shame, increased feelings of anxiety, decreased peak motivational state, and decreased awareness of internal bodily states.

Sexual objectification has been studied based on the proposition that girls and women develop their primary view of their physical selves from observing others. These observations can take place in the media or through personal experience.&lt;ref name=bartky&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartky |first=Sandra Lee |author-link=Sandra Bartky |contribution=On psychological oppression |editor-last=Bartky |editor-first=Sandra Lee |editor-link=Sandra Bartky |title=Femininity and domination: studies in the phenomenology of oppression |page=26 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-415-90186-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a blend of expected and actual exposure, women are socialized to objectify their own physical characteristics from a [[Grammatical person|third-person]] perception, which is identified as self-objectification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaschak |first=Ellyn |author-link=Ellyn Kaschak |title=Engendered lives: a new psychology of women's experience |page=12 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York, New York |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-465-01349-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women and girls develop an expected physical appearance for themselves, based on observations of others; and are aware that others are likely to observe as well. The sexual objectification and self-objectification of women is believed to influence social [[gender roles]] and inequalities between the sexes.&lt;ref name=Goldenberg&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldenberg |first1=Jamie L. |last2=Roberts |first2=Tomi-Ann |contribution=The beast within the beauty: an existential perspective on the objectification and condemnation of women |editor-last1=Greenberg |editor-first1=Jeff |editor-last2=Koole |editor-first2=Sander L. |editor-last3=Pyszczynski |editor-first3=Tom |title=Handbook of experimental existential psychology |pages=71–85 |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-59385-040-1 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-objectification===

[[Self-objectification]] can increase in situations which heighten the awareness of an individual’s physical appearance.&lt;ref name=frederickson1.82&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Fredrickson |first1=Barbara L. |last2=Harrison |first2=Kristen |author-link1=Barbara Fredrickson |title=Throwing like a girl: self-objectification predicts adolescent girls’ motor performance |journal=[[Journal of Sport and Social Issues]] |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=79–101 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|Sage]] |doi=10.1177/0193723504269878 |date=February 2005|ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} Here, the presence of a [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] observer is enhanced. Therefore, when individuals know others are looking at them, or will be looking at them, they are more likely to care about their physical appearance. Examples of the enhanced presence of an observer include the presence of an audience, camera, or other known observer.

===Women, girls, and self-objectification===
Primarily, objectification theory describes how women and girls are influenced as a result of expected social and [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name=bartky/&gt; Research indicates not all women are influenced equally, due to the [[anatomical]], [[hormonal]], and [[Genetics|genetic]] differences of the female body; however, women’s bodies are often objectified and evaluated more frequently.&lt;ref name=frederickson1.82 /&gt;{{rp|90–95}} Self-objectification in girls tends to stem from two main causes: the internalization of traditional beauty standards as translated through media as well as any instances of sexual objectification that they might encounter in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McKay |first=Tajare' |title=Female self-objectification: causes, consequences and prevention |journal=McNair Scholars Research Journal |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=53–70 |publisher=[[Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program|McNair Scholars Program]] |date=30 September 2013 |url=http://commons.emich.edu/mcnair/vol6/iss1/7/ |ref=harv |postscript=.}} [http://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&amp;context=mcnair Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for women to translate their anxieties over their constant sense of objectification into obsessive self-surveillance. This, in turn, can lead to many serious problems in women and girls, including "body shame, anxiety, negative attitudes toward menstruation, a disrupted flow of consciousness, diminished awareness of internal bodily states, depression, sexual dysfunction, and disordered eating."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Calogero |first1=Rachel M. |last2=Davis |first2=William N. |last3=Thompson |first3=J. Kevin |title=The role of self-objectification in the experience of women with eating disorders |journal=[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=43–50 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |doi=10.1007/s11199-005-1192-9 |date=January 2005 |ref=harv |postscript=.|url=http://brown.uk.com/eatingdisorders/calogero.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual objectification occurs when a person is identified by their sexual body parts or sexual function. In essence, an individual loses their identity, and is recognized solely by the physical characteristics of their body.&lt;ref name=bartky/&gt; The purpose of this recognition is to bring enjoyment to others, or to serve as a sexual object for society.&lt;ref name=LeMoncheck /&gt; Sexual objectification can occur as a [[social construct]] among individuals.

===Psychological consequences===
Objectification theory suggests both direct and indirect consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include [[self consciousness]] in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment is one of the challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading.&lt;ref name="Doob"&gt;{{cite book |last=Doob |first=Christopher B. |title=Social inequality and social stratification in US society |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-205-79241-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into [[mental health]] problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats ([[Clinical depression|depression]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[bulimia]], and [[sexual dysfunction]]), and increased body shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Moradi |first1=Bonnie |last2=Huang |first2=Yu-Ping |title=Objectification theory and psychology of women: a decade of advances and future directions |journal=[[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=377–398 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|Sage]] |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2008.00452.x |date=December 2008  |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including [[disordered eating]], [[mental health]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], motor performance, [[body image]], idealized body type, [[stereotype]] formation, sexual perception and sexual typing.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2/&gt;&lt;ref name=frederickson1.82/&gt; Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, [[cosmetic surgery]], etc.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.

===Causes of depression===
[[Learned helplessness]] theory posits that because human bodies are only alterable to a certain point, people develop a sense of body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt; Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes this results in a state of depression.&lt;ref name=fredrickson2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doob"/&gt;

'''Solar radius''' is a unit of [[distance]] used to express the size of [[star]]s in [[astronomy]] relative to the [[Sun]]. The solar [[radius]] is usually defined as the radius to the layer in the [[Sun]]'s [[photosphere]] where the [[Optical_depth_(astrophysics)|optical depth]] equals 2/3:

:&lt;math&gt;1\,R_{\odot} = 6.957\times 10^5 \hbox{ km} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The solar radius is approximately {{convert|695,700|km|mi|abbr=off}}, which is about 10 times the average radius of [[Jupiter]], about 109 times the radius of the [[Earth]], and 1/215th of an [[astronomical unit]], the distance of the Earth from the Sun. It varies slightly from pole to equator due to its [[stellar rotation|rotation]], which induces an oblateness in the order of 10 parts per million. ''(See [[1 gigametre]] for similar distances.)''&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/02oct_oblatesun/ NASA RHESSI oblateness measurements 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The unmanned [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] spacecraft was used to measure the radius of the Sun by timing transits of Mercury across the surface during 2003 and 2006. The result was a measured radius of {{Convert|696342|+/-|65|km|mi|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=arxiv1203_4898&gt;{{citation | first1=Marcelo | last1=Emilio | first2=Jeff R. | last2=Kuhn | first3=Rock I. | last3=Bush | first4=Isabelle F. | last4=Scholl | title=Measuring the Solar Radius from Space during the 2003 and 2006 Mercury Transits  | arxiv=1203.4898 |bibcode = 2012ApJ...750..135E |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/750/2/135 | volume=750 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haberreiter, Schmutz &amp; Kosovichev (2008)&lt;ref name=Hab2008&gt;{{citation | first1 = M | last1=Haberreiter | first2=W | last2=Schmutz | first3=A.G. | last3=Kosovichev | title=Solving the Discrepancy between the Seismic and Photospheric Solar Radius | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=675 | issue=1 | pages=L53-L56 | doi=10.1086/529492 | bibcode=2008ApJ...675L..53H| arxiv=0711.2392 }}&lt;/ref&gt; determined the radius corresponding to the solar photosphere to be {{Convert|695660|+/-|140|km|mi|abbr=off}}. This new value is consistent with helioseismic estimates; the same study showed that previous estimates using inflection point methods had been overestimated by approximately {{cvt|300|km|mi}}.

== Nominal solar radius ==

In 2015, the [[International Astronomical Union]] passed Resolution B3, which defined a set of nominal conversion constants for stellar and planetary [[astronomy]]. Resolution B3 defined the ''nominal solar radius'' (symbol &lt;math&gt;R^{N}_{\odot}&lt;/math&gt;) to be equal to ''exactly'' 695,700&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=IAU2015resB3&gt;{{citation | first1=E.E. | last1=Mamajek | first2=A. | last2=Prsa | first3=G. | last3=Torres | first4=al. | last4=et | title=IAU 2015 Resolution B3 on Recommended Nominal Conversion Constants for Selected Solar and Planetary Properties | arxiv=1510.07674 |bibcode = 2015arXiv151007674M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nominal values were adopted to help astronomers avoid confusion when quoting stellar radii in units of the Sun's radius, even when future observations will likely refine the Sun's actual photospheric radius (which is currently only known to about the ±100–200&amp;nbsp;km accuracy).


==Examples==
Solar radii as a unit are popular when talking about spacecraft moving close to the sun. Two spacecraft in the 2010s. 

*[[Solar Orbiter]] (as close as 45 Solar radii, R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)
*[[Parker Solar Probe]] (as close as 9 Solar radii, R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19525">The '''Woman's Civic Betterment Club''' (also known as the "WCBC" or the "Roanoke Civic Betterment Club") of [[Roanoke, Virginia]], was started in 1907 to improve the sanitation and civic life in Roanoke and the surrounding area. The Club issued a press release claiming that the “object of this organization shall be to gain the co-operation of all loyal and progressive citizens in making the Magic City a city beautiful, to promote health and cleanliness, to advance present conditions, and to point to higher ideals.”&lt;ref&gt;Dotson, Paul R. 2003.[https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1067&amp;context=gradschool_dissertations "Magic City" class, community, and reform in Roanoke, Virginia, 1882-1912]. Louisiana State University Doctoral Dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt; The WCBC is significant in southwestern Virginia because it was an early woman's organization to push for political change and political power at a time when women had little or no power except by persuading men to change their minds.

==WCBC Origins==
At a time when women could not vote, the WCBC was established to improve the Roanoke city infrastructure. Started in 1906 and established in 1907, by 1913 it had 180 members, and was part of the Women's Clubs of America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uUkMAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;ots=JXR6iQ8cnA&amp;dq=%22Roanoke%20Civic%20Betterment%20Club%22&amp;pg=PA241#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Roanoke%20Civic%20Betterment%20Club%22&amp;f=false Official Register and Directory of Women's Clubs of America]. "Virginia". Page 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

These women formed the Women's Civic Betterment Club in 1906, a civic club to have lasting effects on Roanoke's future. It was a move of "responsible and responsive women of the city which would ultimately lead to the formation of a library, a juvenile court, a nursery school for the children of working mothers, and a local unit of the [[American Cancer Society]]. The maiden effort, however, was a plan for the city, only the fifth such ever done for any city. The club, led by Mrs. Lucian H. Cocke&lt;ref&gt;Cocke, “From Hoopskirts to Airplanes,” 99-104. Mrs.
Lucian H. Cocke, “The Woman’s Civic Betterment Club of Roanoke,” The Virginia Realtor (Sept
1926): 35.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Willie Walker Caldwell|Mrs. M.M. Caldwell]],&lt;ref&gt;O. Link Winston Link Museum. History Museum Photograph Collection "[http://hswv.pastperfectonline.com/photo/BD3D6C6A-D260-4297-957D-302364421785Southwest Virginia Fall Festival Parade]." Description: A black and white photograph taken in 1907 of Mrs. Manley M. Caldwell (Willie Walker Caldwell) and Mrs. Lucian H. Cocke (Sarah Johnson Hagan Cocke), riding in a flower bedecked horse-drawn carriage in the Floral Parade of the Southwest Virginia Fall Festival. There is a third unidentified lady riding with them (possibly Mrs. Samuel W. Jamison (Alice Peyton Terry Jamison), who was also very involved in the club). These ladies are members of the Woman's Civic Betterment Club of Roanoke, Virginia. The parade was part of the Virginia Fall Festival, which was started by the Woman's Civic Betterment Club in an effort to improve city of Roanoke. The parade had two sections, one for horse drawn carriages and the other for automobiles. The festival was held at the Roanoke Armory and lasted two weeks. The carriage is driven by two liveried black men in top hats. The parade is going by a large Victorian clapboard house where there are several people hanging out of the windows to get a better view of the event.&lt;/ref&gt; engaged John Nolen of Boston to develop a comprehensive plan for the development of Roanoke".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Danielle. The Railroad Builds a Magic City: Roanoke 1880-1910."[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~class/am485_98/hall/progress.html New Progress]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The club is noted for its influence in city planning, public sanitation and engineering, cultural activities, and publications. "While the city fathers had been successful in attracting investors and industry, they had done little to address the city’s cultural needs and improve its public spaces. The city mothers, however, knew that sanitation, safety, good schools, playgrounds and cultural opportunities were equally important to the city’s future. In 1906, they formed the Woman’s Civic Betterment Club to tackle these issues. (Sarah Butler’s mother, Willie Walker Caldwell, was one of the organizers of the WCBC.) They commissioned studies and lobbied city council for improvements – with mixed results."&lt;ref&gt;Historical Society of Western Virginia. 2012. "One Year in Roanoke: 1921". The Roanoker.&lt;/ref&gt;

==City Planning==
Concerned with the open sewers, abundant saloons and traffic problems, and rapid growth.&lt;ref&gt;Alderson, Debra Lynn. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26797605 John Nolen, City Planner: The Roanoke Plans (1907, 1928)]. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In less than twenty years, from 1882 to 1900, Roanoke had grown from 669 citizens to 21,000. In 1907 the WCBC held a "Great Fall Festival" in order to raise money to hire a city planner. They were able to raise enough money to hire [[John Nolen]]. At the festival, they were able to raise the equivalent of $125,000 (they raised $5,000.00, or about $125,000.00 in 2017 dollars). This was enough to hire Nolen and two bacteriologists who were able to report on Roanoke's sanitation problems.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon, Emily. 2017. "[http://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/harmon-the-woman-s-civic-betterment-club-how-women-shaped/article_0dc120df-bc08-5e67-94f9-66b4d210ac03.html The Womans' Civic Betterment Club: How Women Shaped Roanoke]." [[Roanoke Times]]. November 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
"On December 7, 1906, more than 100 women turned out for an urgently-called meeting in Roanoke Virginia, to discuss matters of the utmost importance. Two days later, the group met again and chartered the Roanoke Civic Betterment Club. Its mission: to ensure sanitary conditions in the city's market district, to provide a healthier community for their families, and to ensure quality education for their children."&lt;ref&gt;Robb, Lynda Bird, M. Caldwell Butler, Malcolm Bryan, George Kegley, John Nolen, and Clare White. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/471480086 The Hand That Rocked the Cradle Pulled the Strings: The Story and Legacy of the Roanoke Civic Betterment Club]. [Roanoke, Va.]: Blue Ridge PBS, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the recommendations of John Nolen included planting trees along the streets; renaming the streets "avenues" for those going east-west, and "Streets" for those running north-south; creating parkways and playgrounds; dividing the city into four districts.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen, John. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45067574 Remodeling Roanoke; Report to the Committee on Civic Improvement]. [Roanoke, Va.]: [Stone Prtg. and Manufacturing Co.], 1907. Electronic version: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433082493283 Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparing the [[Melrose–Rugby, Roanoke, Virginia|Melrose-Rugby Historic District]] in Roanoke, the effects of the Woman's Civic Betterment Club were appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;National Register of Historic Places Registration Form NPS Form 10-900, June 19, 2013. [http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Roanoke/128-6261_Melrose-Rugby%20HD_2013_NRHP_FINAL.pdf Melrose-Rugby Historic District].&lt;/ref&gt; The Woman's Civic Betterment Club also worked with Nolen on the [[Riverland/Walnut Hills, Roanoke, Virginia]] neighborhood in promoting sanitation and overcrowding. At the turn of the century, Riverland housed railway workers and their families, and contributed to overcrowding and unhealthy tenement conditions.&lt;ref&gt;National Register of Historic Places Registration Form NPS Form 10-900, July 12, 2013. "[https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/13000646.pdf Riverland Historic District]." Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under contract, Nolen focused on the development of a civic center, which led to the construction of the Beaux-Arts style Municipal Building in 1915. He also made provisions for paved streets with gutters, sewage systems and other sanitation improvements in the residential neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Landon, Barbara, executive producer. “The Hand that Rocked the Cradle Pulled the Strings: The Story and Legacy of the Roanoke Civic Betterment Club.” Roanoke, VA: Blue Ridge Public Television, 1997 (video).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to producing the reports on civic improvement, the WCBC also hired speakers to promote and discuss the benefits of city improvement. Mr. J. Horace McFarland of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to come and speak to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://virginiachronicle.com/cgi-bin/virginia?a=d&amp;d=TVN19110505.1.8 Evening News]. Roanoke. Volume 23, Number 105, May 5, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; During his talk, [[J. Horace McFarland]], president of the American Civic Improvement Association, criticized several areas of Roanoke. Indeed, below his window at the hotel was an open "pit of slime and filth". The WCBC paid other speakers to come, including bacteriologists who criticized Roanoke's potential for typhoid, tuberculosis and polluted milk.&lt;ref&gt;Dotson, Paul R. 2003.[https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1067&amp;context=gradschool_dissertations "Magic City" class, community, and reform in Roanoke, Virginia, 1882-1912]. Louisiana State University Doctoral Dissertation. Pages 355-356.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Woman's Civic Betterment Club turned in Nolen's work, it was filed away by the city fathers. The city finally adopted Nolen's plans in the 1930s, and the extensive greenway system, riverside drive and Mill Mountain Park are part of that legacy of John Nolen and the Woman's Civic Betterment Club. "While Nolen’s work deserves public recognition in Roanoke, the women of the WCBC had a greater role in shaping Roanoke into the city it is today. Roanoke did little to recognize the work of these women over one hundred years ago; perhaps now is the time to honor their contributions."&lt;ref&gt;Harmon, Emily. 2017. "[http://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/harmon-the-woman-s-civic-betterment-club-how-women-shaped/article_0dc120df-bc08-5e67-94f9-66b4d210ac03.html The Womans' Civic Betterment Club: How Women Shaped Roanoke]." [[Roanoke Times]]. November 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library==
While the Woman's Civic Betterment Club was not able to get all their goals accomplished, one goal for a public library was completed. Sarah Poage Caldwell Butler, married to  William Wilson Samuel Butler and mother to Dr. [[M. Caldwell Butler]], was trained in [[Library Science]] and had worked at the [[New York Public Library]] before her marriage. She worked with the WCBC to petition the [[Roanoke City Council]] to establish a library. "Possibly believing they were presenting an insurmountable hurdle, council members told Butler that if she could raise $30,000, the city would contribute the rest. In one week’s time (appropriately, Library Week April 19–24), Butler raised $27,000!" Sarah Butler also worked with Miss [[Lucy Addison]] to open a public library for the black neighborhoods in segregated Roanoke, and the [[Gainsboro, Roanoke, Virginia|Gainsboro]] Branch Public Library opened seven months later, on December 13, 1921. "Sarah Butler died on December 2, 1983, at age 91. In a 1971 interview, she stated that getting a public library in Roanoke was her proudest civic achievement."&lt;ref&gt;Historical Society of Western Virginia. 2012. "One Year in Roanoke: 1921". The Roanoker.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roanoke Cook Book==
While much of the cost of producing the first city plan came from the Great Fall Festival, additional money was needed. It was provided from the sales of the WCBC "[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2061983 The Roanoke Cook Book, Favorite Recipes by Some of Roanoke's Good Housekeepers]." Compiled by Mrs. Albert A. Stone from the WCBC members and published quickly in 1907, the 164 page book was a financial success. In addition to the recipes, the book also included advertising of local businesses and services to offset the costs of publication. "Cook book sales helped pay for one of the first city plans ever drawn up; and a woman's civic club was the first organized body to arrange for the preparation of a city plan by a competent professional man."&lt;ref&gt;Forum of civics (Houston, Tex.). [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9848105 Civics for Houston].: V.1 (No. 1-12) ; Jan. 1928-Jan. 1929. [Houston, Tex.]: [publisher not identified], 1928. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xOkTAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;ots=2LKP1xNzOs&amp;dq=%22Civic%20Betterment%20Club%22%20roanoke&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Civic%20Betterment%20Club%22%20roanoke&amp;f=false Roanoke Counts Cost of Not Planning: Cook Book Sales by Woman's Club Made Possible the First Plan of Virginia.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a hundred years later, the WCBC cook book is still referred to as an example of period cooking in Southwestern Virginia." The book says on page one: "Purchasers may congratulate themselves on acquiring so much kitchen lore in clear and condensed form." The recipes are so unique, not necessarily in the ingredients, but in the descriptions and the "flavor" of the times that is given. I don't know about the taste of the food if you choose to follow the recipes, but I'm sure you will enjoy reading them." In addition to the cooking recipes, advice is also given on using some of the recommended dishes for treating medical conditions." The chicken broth, for example,  is intended for sick children: "If patient has a fever or is very ill, set the broth aside until cold, and then remove the grease, after which heat and serve."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cookinlikeits1917.blogspot.com/2013/ 1907 Chicken Broth]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Woman's Civic Betterment Club was formed at a time when women could not vote, hold elected office, or influence civic government directly. Yet, within only a few years the citizens of Roanoke as seen marked improvement in the acquisition of land for public parks; school facilities; better city sanitation; abatement of dust and dirt nuisances on the streets. While they were unable to directly influence the city council, they were able to press for the first public library in Roanoke, and the purchase of parks, playgrounds, and pressed for a juvenile court. As a writer in 1912 said, "Their cooperation in work for Roanoke's uplift and welfare has been of signal service to the community, and the part they have taken in the general scheme of development work is worthy of the highest praise."

[[File:Alanna Spence - queen bee (by).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Worker policing is found in [[honey bee]]s and other [[hymenoptera]]ns including some species of [[bumblebee]]s, [[ants]] and [[wasps]].]]

'''Worker policing''' is a behavior seen in colonies of social [[hymenoptera]]ns ([[ants]], [[bees]], and [[wasps]]) whereby [[worker (bee)|worker females]] eat or remove eggs that have been laid by other workers rather than those laid by a queen.  Worker policing ensures that the offspring of the queen will predominate in the group. In certain species of bees, ants and wasps, workers or the queen may also act aggressively towards fertile workers.

==Evolutionary basis==
{{See also|Haplodiploidy}}

[[File:Haplodiploid-sex-determination-system3.png|thumb|upright|The [[Haplodiploidy|haplodiploid]] sex determination system has consequences for worker policing behavior]]
In many [[Eusociality|social insect]] communities, sex is determined through [[haplodiploidy]]. [[Haploid]] male [[Drone (bee)|drone]]s develop from unfertilized eggs while [[diploid]] females develop from fertilized eggs. Queens of a colony may mate with one or several drones. On average, a queen shares half of her genes with her sons, but only shares a quarter of her genes with the sons of fertile female workers. Therefore, it is in the queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, and not the sons of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.&lt;ref name=Policing.Bee/&gt;

By contrast, the worker shares half of her genes with her sons and only a quarter with her brothers. Furthermore, the workers in colonies with a single once-mated queen are related to their nephews by three eighths, higher than they are related to brothers. This results in a conflict where the queen and worker females are at odds over the proportion of male offspring they contribute, since each side tries to maximize its [[reproductive fitness]].&lt;ref name=Policing.Bee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratnieks|first=Francis L.W.|author2=P. Kirk Visscher |title=Worker policing in the honeybee|journal=Nature|date=December 1989|volume=342|issue=6251|pages=796–797|doi=10.1038/342796a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v342/n6251/abs/342796a0.html|bibcode=1989Natur.342..796R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queens favor production of their own sons while workers favor production of their own sons, and do not stop their sisters from laying because of the favorable relatedness to nephews.

Worker policing occurs when worker bees in the colony are genetically more [[Coefficient of relationship|closely related]] to the queen than the reproductive female. In many instances, the eggs of the female worker are eaten, or she is repeatedly attacked by other workers. This mechanism of egg removal ensures that the queen's sons predominate.&lt;ref name=Resistance&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wenseleers|first=Tom|author2=Adam G. Hart |author3=Francis L. W. Ratnieks |title=When Resistance Is Useless: Policing and the Evolution of Reproductive Acquiescence in Insect Societies|journal=The American Naturalist|date=December 2004|volume=164|issue=6|pages=E154-E167|doi=10.1086/425223|jstor=10.1086/425223|publisher=The University of Chicago Press for The American Society of Naturalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments confirming the role of [[kin selection]] in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, which can lead to lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp ''[[Dolichovespula saxonica]]'' mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Kevin R.|author2=Francis L.W. Ratnieks |title=Social insects: Facultative worker policing in a wasp|journal=Nature|date=October 2000|volume=407|issue=6805|pages=692–693|doi=10.1038/35037665|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6805/full/407692a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although early theories of worker policing focused on the kin selection component, evidence from [[Apis mellifera|honey bees]] suggests that [[altruism]] is sometimes enforced. Fewer workers reproduce as policing effectiveness rises, and policing effectiveness decreases with increasing relatedness except in colonies with no queen.  This suggests that worker policing is a social sanction imposed on [[Gene-centered view of evolution#Selfish-gene theory|selfish individuals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wenseleers|first=Tom|author2=Francis L. W. Ratnieks |title=Enforced altruism in insect societies|journal=Nature|date=November 2006|volume=444|issue=7115|pages=50|doi=10.1038/444050a|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7115/full/444050a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed mechanisms for kin recognition==

[[File:Fusca feeding.jpg|thumb|''[[Formica fusca]]'' ants can recognize nest-mates]]

Mechanisms suggested for egg discrimination in worker policing include queen hydrocarbons, fertile worker hydrocarbons, and nestmate recognition.

===Queen hydrocarbons===

A study on the [[carpenter ant]] ''Camponotus floridanus'' found a special surface [[hydrocarbon]] on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups that did not have queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.&lt;ref name=Queen.Hydrocarbon/&gt;

===Fertile worker hydrocarbons===

The study of cuticle hydrocarbons has also been applied to the reproductive workers. In some colonies of the ponerine ant ''[[Platythyrea punctata]]'', the presence of CHCs in new reproductive workers triggered aggressive behavior from the rest of the colony, often between new and old reproductive workers. Specifically, the old reproductive workers rubbed a marker hydrocarbon on the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of the new females, identifying them as rivals and targets for aggression.&lt;ref name=Worker.Hydrocarbon/&gt;

===Nestmate recognition===

In contrast to the other ant species, worker policing in the ant ''[[Formica fusca]]''  appears to incorporate nestmate recognition in addition to the queen hydrocarbons. Workers displayed higher levels of aggression toward non-nest mates and also removed some queen-laid eggs. Thus, queen hydrocarbons were not the only contributor to discrimination of the eggs.&lt;ref name=Nestmate.Recognition/&gt;

==Examples from social Hymenoptera==
Worker policing has [[Convergent evolution|evolved convergently]] in several social insect species. The following cases are examples:

=== Bees ===
[[File:Apis mellifera carnica worker honeycomb 3.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Apis mellifera]]'' workers remove worker-laid eggs by eating them (oophagy)]]

One of the first examples of worker policing to be discovered was in the honey bee, ''[[Apis mellifera]]''. Worker policing is prevalent in most honey bee colonies, and worker reproduction is minimal (0.12%) in this species.&lt;ref name=Quant.Study.Bee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Visscher|first=P. Kirk|title=A quantitative study of worker reproduction in honey bee colonies|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=1989|volume=25|issue=4|pages=247–254|jstor=4600337|doi=10.1007/bf00300050}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Worker policing occurs via egg-eating ([[oophagy]]) in ''Apis mellifera'' colonies.&lt;ref name=Resistance/&gt; In many of these hives, the activation of ovaries in fertile females is diminished, suggesting that there are disincentives to laying eggs.&lt;ref name=Resistance/&gt;

Workers in colonies of the Asian honey bee, ''[[Apis florea]]'', are also reported to engage in oophagy. Using [[microsatellite]] analysis, researchers concluded that no mature drones had non-queen alleles in the colonies they investigated. Thus, even though workers had activated ovaries and were capable of laying eggs, worker policing ensured the functional sterility of otherwise fertile workers.&lt;ref name=wp_a.florea&gt;{{cite journal| last=Halling| first=Luke A|author2=Benjamin P. Oldroyd |author3=Wandee Wattanachaiyingcharoen |author4=Andrew B. Barron |author5=Piyamas Nanork |author6=Siriwat Wongsiri |title=Worker policing in the bee ''Apis florea''| journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology| year=2001| volume=49| issue=6| pages=509–513| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002650100325| doi=10.1007/s002650100325|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A higher percentage of female workers of the bee species ''[[Apis cerana]]'' are reported to activate their ovaries than those of ''Apis mellifera'' or ''Apis florea''. When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days. However, policing workers continued to eat the worker-laid eggs, suggesting that the mechanism of policing in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.&lt;ref name=wp_a.cerana&gt;{{cite journal| last=Oldroyd| first=Benjamin P.|author2=Luke A. Halling |author3=Gregory Good |author4=Wandee Wattanachaiyingcharoen |author5=Andrew B. Barron |author6=Piyamas Nanork |author7=Siriwat Wongsiri |author8=Francis L. Ratnieks | title=Worker policing and worker reproduction in ''Apis cerana''| journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology| year=2001| volume=50| issue=4| pages=371–377| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002650100376|doi=10.1007/s002650100376| publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observation that all these [[Apis (genus)|Apis]] species engage in [[polyandry]] has led researchers to conclude that worker policing is [[plesiomorphic]] for the Apis genus.&lt;ref name=wp_a.cerana/&gt;

Worker policing also occurs in the primitively eusocial [[bumblebee]]s such as ''[[Bombus terrestris]]''.&lt;ref name=Zanette&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zanette |first1=L. R. |last2=Miller |first2=S.

=== Ants ===
[[File:Harpegnathos saltator fight.jpg|thumb|Worker of ''[[Harpegnathos saltator]]'' killing a queen]]

{{further information|Gamergate}}

In colonies of the ponerine ant, ''Pachycondyla inversa,'' workers eat the eggs of fertile female workers, known as [[gamergate]]s, and display aggressive behavior towards egg-laying females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=D'Ettorre| first=Patrizia|author2=Jürgen Heinze |author3=Francis L W Ratnieks | title=Worker policing by egg eating in the ponerine ant ''Pachycondyla inversa''| journal=Proc Biol Sci|date=July 2004| volume=271| issue=1546| pages=1427–1434| doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2742| pmc=1691738| pmid=15306343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In colonies of the ant ''Gnamptogenys menadensis'', workers will sometimes mate and lay eggs while others remain as virgins to lay [[trophic egg]]s to be used as food. In a display of policing, workers can immobilize female reproductive workers by biting their limbs; it is reported that 50% of the victims die from this treatment. The attacking workers may also drag offending workers outside the colony. Since workers can lay both male and female eggs, worker policing could be favored as the cost to the community is large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobin| first=Bruno |author2=J. Billen |author3=C. Peeters| title=Policing behaviour towards virgin egg layers in a polygynous ponerine ant |journal=Anim.

The ant species ''Aphaenogaster smythiesi japonica'' also display evidence of policing. When researchers separated and then reunited workers from colonies that did or did not have queens, workers from the queen-containing colonies attacked the workers with activated ovaries from the queenless colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Iwanishi |first=Satoru |author2=Eisuke Hasegawab |author3=Kyohsuke Ohkawaraa| title=Worker oviposition and policing behaviour in the myrmicine ant ''Aphaenogaster smythiesi japonica'' Forel| journal=Animal Behaviour |date=September 2003| volume=66| issue=3| pages=513–519| doi=10.1006/anbe.2003.2222 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347203922226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the queenless ant ''Streblognathus peetersi'', policing helps to select gamergates. The workers immobilize gamergates with lowered fertility, enabling high-ranking workers to take over as new gamergates.&lt;ref name="GadauFewell2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gadau |first1=Jürgen |last2=Fewell |first2=Jennifer |last3=Wilson |first3=Edward O. |authorlink3=Edward O. Wilson|title=Organization of Insect Societies: From Genome to Sociocomplexity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_79XeC-xvCcC&amp;pg=PA227 |year=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03125-8 |pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ponerine ant ''[[Harpegnathos saltator]]'', worker policing prevents the number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having too many of them would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a [[pheromone]] detected by [[olfaction]]. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liebig |first1=J&amp;uuml;rgen |last2=Peeters |first2=Christian |last3=H&amp;ouml;llldobler |first3=Bert |title=Worker policing limits the number of reproductives in a ponerine ant |journal=Proc.

=== Wasps ===
[[File:GemeineWespe2.jpg|thumb|''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris]]'' workers can display aggression towards other fertile workers]]
The tree wasp ''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris]]'' also displays worker policing. Both egg-eating and aggression are reported in these wasp communities, and the queen also engages in the policing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wenseleers| first=Tom |author2=A.

In colonies of the paper wasp, ''[[Polistes chinensis|Polistes chinensis antennalis]]'', workers can lay up to a quarter of the male eggs in the colony. The number of eggs that survived to hatching, however, was minimal compared to the number produced by the queen. Analysis of the microsatellite markers showed that both queens and workers contributed to policing of worker and queen-laid eggs even in [[Monogyny|monogynous]] and monandrous colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Saigo| first=T.|author2=K. Tsuchida | title=Queen and worker policing in monogynous and monandrous colonies of a primitively eusocial wasp|date=December 2004| volume=271| pages=S509–S512| pmc=1810092| pmid=15801618| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0238| journal=Proc Biol Sci}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common wasp, ''[[Vespula vulgaris]]'', engages in worker policing, and it is known that a significant number of workers have active ovaries. However, studies by researchers have suggested that relatedness may not be the key factor in the development of worker policing. Rather, it is hypothesized that worker policing has been selected due to conflict suppression in the colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Kevin R.|author2=Francis L. W. Ratnieks |title=Convergent evolution of worker policing by egg eating in the honeybee and common wasp|journal=Proc Biol Sci|date=January 2001|volume=268|issue=1463|pages=169–74|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1346|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/268/1463/169.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a test of worker policing, researchers examined the removal of worker-laid eggs in ''[[Vespula rufa]]'', a wasp that has low paternity. Under the testing conditions, worker policing was not as efficient, and some of the drones appeared to be from worker-laid eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wenseleers| first=Tom|author2=N. S. Badcock |author3=K. Erven |author4=A. Tofilski |author5=F. S. Nascimento |author6=A. G. Hart |author7=T. A. Burke |author8=M. E. Archer |author9=F. L W.

The [[European Hornet]], ''Vespa crabro'', was previously thought to be under reproductive pheromone control by the queen, thus explaining why the other females didn't reproduce, even though they were capable of doing so.  Experiments by Foster showed that the workers were instead regulating sterility in each other, thus instead exhibiting worker policing.  While each worker is capable of reproducing, the colony as a whole is more efficient and organized if the workers allow only the queen to lay larvae.&lt;ref name="police"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Foster, K.R., Gulliver, J., Ratnieks, F.L.W.| title=Worker policing in the European hornet Vespa crabro| journal=Insectes Sociaux| year=2002 |  volume=49 | issue=1 | pages=41–44 | doi=10.1007/s00040-002-8277-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Synoeca cyanea]]'' also engage in worker policing during times when queen repopulation is not needed. They will prevent females from laying eggs through aggressive behavior and egg-eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Morphological and Physiological Caste Differences in Synoeca cyanea (Hymenoptero, Vespidae, Epiponini) According to the Ontogenetic Development of the Colonies|last = Noda|first = Silvia Cristina Mari|date = 2003|journal = Sociobiology|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exceptions ==

===Anarchic syndrome===

Very rarely, female worker bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, in a process known as the anarchic syndrome. Female reproductive workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even in the presence of a queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they [[mimicry|mimic]] queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at individual and group levels.&lt;ref name=Anarchic.Syndrome /&gt;

===Selfish worker policing===

''[[Temnothorax unifasciatus]]'', a [[Myrmicinae|myrmicinid]] ant, has been shown not to have collective worker policing. However, when a queen is removed, a rank order for reproduction appears, where top ranking reproductives display aggression towards lower-order female workers. Thus, reductions in egg laying are created by [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance hierarchies]]. Individuals do not act in benefit of the colony, instead opting to increase their own fitness by laying their eggs and reducing the contributions of opponents.&lt;ref name=Selfishpolicing /&gt;

This type of policy is common in [[Dolichovespula norwegica]] wasps where despite being more related to other workers’ sons, worker-laid eggs were consumed by other workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Co-occurrence of three types of egg policing in the Norwegian wasp Dolichovespsula wasp|last = Bonckaert|first = W.|date = 2001|journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|doi = 10.1007/s00265-010-1064-3|pmid = |last2 = Tofilski|first2 = A.|last3 = Nascimento|first3 = F.S.|last4 = Billen|first4 = J.|last5 = Ratnieks|first5 = F.L.W.|last6 = Wenseleers|first6 = T. |volume=65 |pages=633–640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worker policing without genetic conflict===

In the [[Thelytoky|thelytokous]] ant ''Platythyrea punctata'', colonies are [[cloning|clonal]]; therefore, workers are all equally related genetically, and worker policing is not expected as there is no genetic conflict. However, one would expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more time spent on individual reproduction would be predicted to detract from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker policing here is favored for group efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartmann|first=Anne|author2=J. Wantia |author3=J. A. Torres |author4=J.
