'''Argus''' was a two-beam high power [[infrared]] [[neodymium]] doped [[silica glass]] [[laser]] with a {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} output aperture built at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in 1976 for the study of [[inertial confinement fusion]]. Argus advanced the study of laser-target interaction and paved the way for the construction of its successor, the 20 beam [[Shiva laser]].

It was known from some of the earlier experiments in ICF that when large laser systems amplified their beams beyond a certain point (typically around the gigawatt level), [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] effects would begin to appear due to the very intense nature of the light. The most serious effect among these was "[[kerr effect|Kerr lensing]]", where, because the beam is so intense, that during its passage through either air or glass the [[electric field]] of the light actually alters the [[index of refraction]] of the material and causes the beam at the most intense points to "self focus" down to filament like structures of extremely high intensity. When a beam collapses into extremely high intensity filaments like this, it can easily exceed the [[Catastrophic optical damage|optical damage threshold]] of laser glass and other optics, severely damaging them by creating pits, cracks and grey tracks through the glass. These effects became so severe after just the first few amplification stages of early lasers, that it was seen as essentially impossible to exceed the gigawatt level for ICF lasers without destroying the laser itself after just a few shots.

In order to improve the quality of the amplified beams, LLNL had started experimenting with the use of [[spatial filter]]s in the single-beam [[Cyclops laser]], built the previous year. The basic idea was to extend the laser device into a very long "beamline", over which any imperfections that accumulated in the beam would be successively removed after every amplification stage. A series of tubes with lenses on either end would focus the light down to a point (the focal point) where it would pass through a pinhole which would reject stray unfocused light, smoothing the beam and eliminating the high intensity spots which would have otherwise been further amplified causing damage to down-beam optics. The technique was so successful on Argus it was often referred to as being "the savior of laser ICF".

After the success of Cyclops in beam smoothing, the next step was to further increase the energy and power in the resulting beams. Argus used a series of five groups of amplifiers and spatial filters arranged along the beamlines, each one boosting power until it reached a total of about 1&amp;nbsp;[[kilojoule]] and 1-2 terawatts per beam. These intensities would have been impossible to achieve without the use of spatial filtering. Argus was designed primarily to characterize large laser beamlines and laser-target interactions, there was no attempt to actually achieve the fusion ignition state in the device as this was understood to be impossible at the energies Argus was capable of delivering. Argus however, was used to further explore higher yields of the so-called "exploding pusher" type targets and to develop x-ray diagnostic cameras to view the hot plasma in such targets, a technique crucial to characterization of target performance on later ICF lasers.

Argus was capable of producing a total of about 4 [[terawatt]]s of power in short pulses of up to about 100 picoseconds, or about 2 terawatts of power in a longer 1 nanosecond pulse (~2 [[kilojoules]]) on a 100 [[micrometre|micrometer]] diameter fusion fuel capsule target. It became the first laser to perform experiments using [[X-rays]] produced by irradiating a [[hohlraum]]. The reduced production of hard X-ray energy via the production of hot electrons while using [[frequency doubled]] and tripled laser light (as opposed to the infrared light directly produced by the laser itself) was first noticed on Argus. This technique would also be later validated in the direct drive mode (at both the [[laboratory for laser energetics|LLE]] and [[Novette laser]]) and subsequently used to enhance laser energy to target plasma coupling efficiency in experiments on nearly all subsequent laser inertial confinement devices. Argus was shut down and dismantled in September 1981. Maximum fusion yield for target implosions on Argus was about 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[neutron]]s per shot.

His research is related to the study of impacts of land use/cover change (LUCC) on [[biodiversity]] loss and [[habitat fragmentation]] in [[tropical dry forest]] environments.

== Current Research ==
Sánchez-Azofeifa uses advanced technology, including remote sensing and [[phenology]] towers, to evaluate land use and cover change in [[Mesoamerica]]. His research focuses on the efficacy of creating protected areas (National Parks and Biological Reserves) and use of Environmental Services payment methods to control [[tropical deforestation]]. In addition, his research examines [[remote sensing]] (multispectral and hyperspectral) in connection with Primary Productivity (PP), [[Leaf Area Index]] (LAI), Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) and biodiversity, particularly in tropical secondary dry forests. He is currently developing techniques to identify and understand the relationship of [[liana]]s (non-self supporting tropical plants) and tropical hardwood species by means of hyperspectral remote sensing to generate data reflecting detailed leaf and canopy level information. Sánchez-Azofeifa's most cited paper is his 2006 [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] article, "Widespread [[amphibian]] extinctions from epidemic disease driven by global warming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7073/abs/nature04246.html|title=Widespread amphibian extinctions from epidemic disease driven by global warming|first1=J.|last1=Alan Pounds|first2=Martín R.|last2=Bustamante|first3=Luis A.|last3=Coloma|first4=Jamie A.|last4=Consuegra|first5=Michael P.

The '''backstaff''' is a [[celestial navigation|navigational]] instrument that was used to measure the [[Horizontal coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] of a [[astronomical object|celestial body]], in particular the [[Sun]] or [[Moon]]. When observing the Sun, users kept the Sun to their back (hence the name) and observed the shadow cast by the upper vane on a horizon vane. It was invented by the English navigator [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] who described it in his book ''Seaman's Secrets'' in 1594.&lt;ref name="BruynsDunn2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Willem Frederik Jacob Mörzer Bruyns |author2=Richard Dunn |title=Sextants at Greenwich: a catalogue of the mariner's quadrants, mariner's astrolabes, cross-staffs, backstaffs, octants, sextants, quintants, reflecting circles and artificial horizons in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YwoQ1L7dV8MC&amp;pg=PT72 |access-date=16 September 2011 |date=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-953254-4 |pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of backstaffs==
Backstaff is the name given to any instrument that measures the altitude of the sun by the projection of a shadow.  It appears that the idea for measuring the sun's altitude using back observations originated with [[Thomas Harriot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Taylor, E.G.R.|title=The Doctrine of Nautical Triangles Compendius|journal= Journal of the Institute of Navigation|volume= 6|date= 1953|pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many types of instruments evolved from the [[cross-staff]] that can be classified as backstaves.  Only the Davis quadrant remains dominant in the history of navigation instruments.  Indeed, the Davis quadrant is essentially synonymous with backstaff. However, Davis was neither the first nor the last to design such an instrument and others are considered here as well.

==Davis quadrant==
[[File:Davis quadrant-MnM 11 NA 97-IMG 5987-black.jpg|thumb|Davis quadrant, made in 1765 by Johannes Van Keulen. On display at the [[Musée national de la Marine]] in Paris.]]
Captain [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] invented a version of the backstaff in 1594.  Davis was a navigator who was quite familiar with the instruments of the day such as the [[mariner's astrolabe]], the [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and the [[cross-staff]].  He recognized the inherent drawbacks of each and endeavoured to create a new instrument that could reduce those problems and increase the ease and accuracy of obtaining solar [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|elevation]]s.

One early version of the quadrant staff is shown in ''Figure 1''.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;[http://www.mcallen.lib.tx.us/books/seasecr/dseasec0.htm The Seaman's Secrets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622142123/http://www.mcallen.lib.tx.us/books/seasecr/dseasec0.htm |date=22 June 2008 }}; text of Davis' publication with illustrations.&lt;/ref&gt;  It had an arc affixed to a staff so that it could slide along the staff (the shape is not critical, though the curved shape was chosen).  The arc (A) was placed so that it would cast its shadow on the ''horizon vane'' (B).  The navigator would look along the staff and observe the horizon through a slit in the horizon vane.  By sliding the arc so that the shadow aligned with the horizon, the angle of the sun could be read on the graduated staff.  This was a simple quadrant, but it was not as accurate as one might like.  The accuracy in the instrument is dependent on the length of the staff, but a long staff made the instrument more unwieldy.  The maximum altitude that could be measured with this instrument was 45°.

The next version of his quadrant is shown in ''Figure 2''.&lt;ref name="davis"/&gt;  The arc on the top of the instrument in the previous version was replaced with a ''shadow vane'' placed on a transom.  This transom could be moved along a graduated scale to indicate the angle of the shadow above the staff.  Below the staff, a 30° arc was added.  The horizon, seen through the ''horizon vane'' on the left, is aligned with the shadow.  The ''sighting vane'' on the arc is moved until it aligns with the view of the horizon.  The angle measured is the sum of the angle indicated by the position of the transom and the angle measured on the scale on the arc.

The instrument that is now identified with Davis is shown in ''Figure 3''.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;  This form evolved by the mid-17th century.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;  The quadrant arc has been split into two parts.  The smaller radius arc, with a span of 60°, was mounted above the staff.  The longer radius arc, with a span of 30° was mounted below.  Both arcs have a common centre.  At the common centre, a slotted ''horizon vane'' was mounted (B).  A moveable ''shadow vane'' was placed on the upper arc so that its shadow was cast on the horizon vane.  A moveable ''sight vane'' was mounted on the lower arc (C).

It is easier for a person to place a vane at a specific location than to read the arc at an arbitrary position.  This is due to [[Vernier scale#Vernier acuity|Vernier acuity]], the ability of a person to align two line segments accurately.  Thus an arc with a small radius, marked with relatively few graduations, can be used to place the shadow vane accurately at a specific angle.  On the other hand, moving the sight vane to the location where the line to the horizon meets the shadow requires a large arc.  This is because the position may be at a fraction of a degree and a large arc allows one to read smaller graduations with greater accuracy.  The large arc of the instrument, in later years, was marked with [[transversal (instrument making)|transversals]] to allow the arc to be read to greater accuracy than the main graduations allow.&lt;ref name="bennett"&gt;Bennett, Jim,  "Catadioptrics and commerce in eighteenth-century London", in History of Science, vol xliv, 2006, pages 247–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Davis was able to optimize the construction of the quadrant to have both a small and a large arc, allowing the effective accuracy of a single arc quadrant of large radius without making the entire instrument so large.  This form of the instrument became synonymous with the backstaff.  It was one of the most widely used forms of the backstaff. Continental European navigators called it the '''English Quadrant'''.

A later modification of the Davis quadrant was to use a ''Flamsteed glass'' in place of the shadow vane; this was suggested by [[John Flamsteed]].&lt;ref name="may"&gt;May, William Edward, ''A History of Marine Navigation'', G. T. Foulis &amp;amp; Co. Ltd., Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, {{ISBN|0-85429-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This placed a lens on the vane that projected an image of the sun on the horizon vane instead of a shadow.  It was useful under conditions where the sky was hazy or lightly overcast; the dim image of the sun was shown more brightly on the horizon vane where a shadow could not be seen.&lt;ref name="bennett"/&gt;

===Usage===

In order to use the instrument, the navigator would place the shadow vane at a location anticipating the altitude of the  sun.  Holding the instrument in front of him, with the sun at his back, he holds the instrument so that the shadow cast by the shadow vane falls on the horizon vane at the side of the slit.  He then moves the sight vane so that he observes the horizon in a line from the sight vane through the horizon vane's slit while simultaneously maintaining the position of the shadow.  This permits him to measure the angle between the horizon and the sun as the sum of the angle read from the two arcs.

Since the shadow's edge represents the [[wiktionary:Limb#Etymology 2|limb]] of the sun, he must correct the value for the [[semidiameter]] of the sun.

===Instruments that derived from the Davis quadrant===
The [[Elton's quadrant]] derived from the Davis quadrant.  It added an index arm with [[spirit level]]s to provide an artificial horizon.

==Demi-cross==
[[Image:Demi-cross.png|thumb|''Figure 4'' – A demi-cross. This instrument was contemporary with the Davis quadrant and popular outside England. It shows its similarity with the first of Davis' versions (''Figure 1'')]]
The '''demi-cross''' was an instrument that was contemporary with the Davis quadrant.  It was popular outside England.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;

The vertical transom was like a half-transom on a [[cross-staff]], hence the name ''demi-cross''.  It supported a ''shadow vane'' (A in ''Figure 4'') that could be set to one of several heights (three according to May,&lt;ref name="may"/&gt; four according to de Hilster&lt;ref name="dehilster"&gt;[http://www.dehilster.info/index.php?doc=http://www.dehilster.info/instrumenten/demi-cross/index.html Nicolàs de Hilster's web site] Web page documenting an excellent reproduction of a demi-cross.&lt;/ref&gt;).  By setting the shadow vane height, the range of angles that could be measured was set.  The transom could be slid along the staff and the angle read from one of the graduated scales on the staff.

The ''sight vane'' (C) and ''horizon vane'' (B) were aligned visually with the horizon.  With the shadow vane's shadow cast on the horizon vane and aligned with the horizon, the angle was determined.  In practice, the instrument was accurate but more unwieldy than the Davis quadrant.&lt;ref name="dehilster"/&gt;

==Plough==
[[File:The plough instrument.svg|thumb|''Figure 5'' – The plough – a transitional instrument with the characteristics of both a [[cross-staff]] and a backstaff]]
The '''plough''' was the name given to an unusual instrument that existed for a short time.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt; It was part [[cross-staff]] and part backstaff. In ''Figure 5'', ''A'' is the transom that casts its shadow on the horizon vane at ''B''. It functions in the same manner as the staff in ''Figure 1''. ''C'' is the sighting vane. The navigator uses the sighting vane and the horizon vane to align the instrument horizontally. The sighting vane can be moved left to right along the staff. ''D'' is a transom just as one finds on a cross-staff. This transom has two vanes on it that can be moved closer or farther from the staff to emulate different-length transoms. The transom can be moved on the staff and used to measure angles.

==Almucantar staff==
{{Main|Almucantar}}
The '''[[Almucantar#Almucantar staff|Almucantar staff]]''' is a device specifically used for measuring the altitude of the sun at low altitudes.

==Cross-staff==
{{Main|Cross-staff}}
The '''[[cross-staff#Cross-staff for navigation|cross-staff]]''' was normally a direct observation instrument.  However, in later years it was modified for use with back observations.

==Quadrant==

There was a variation of the quadrant – the [[quadrant (instrument)#Back observation quadrant|Back observation quadrant]] – that was used for measuring the sun's altitude by observing the shadow cast on a horizon vane.

==Thomas Hood cross-staff==
[[Image:Hood-cross staff.png|thumb|''Figure 6'' – Cross-staff by Thomas Hood. Though called a cross-staff, this instrument uses a shadow vane to cast a shadow on the instrument to measure the altitude of the sun.]]
[[Thomas Hood (mathematician)|Thomas Hood]] invented this cross-staff in 1590.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;  It could be used for surveying, astronomy or other geometric problems.

It consists of two components, a transom and a yard.  The transom is the vertical component and is graduated from 0° at the top to 45° at the bottom.  At the top of the transom, a vane is mounted to cast a shadow.  The yard is horizontal and is graduated from 45° to 90°.  The transom and yard are joined by a special fitting (the ''double socket'' in ''Figure 6'') that permits independent adjustments of the transom vertically and the yard horizontally.

It was possible to construct the instrument with the yard at the top of the transom rather than at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=De Hilster, N. |date=2009 |url=http://www.dehilster.info/instrumenten/masterhood/sis_article_master_hood.pdf |title=Master Hood's cross-staff: a reconstruction |journal=Bulletin of the Scientific Instrument Society |volume=101 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721195410/http://www.dehilster.info/instrumenten/masterhood/sis_article_master_hood.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the transom and yard are set so that the two are joined at their respective 45° settings.  The instrument is held so that the yard is horizontal (the navigator can view the horizon along the yard to assist in this).  The socket is loosened so that the transom is moved vertically until the shadow of the vane is cast at the yard's 90° setting.  If the movement of just the transom can accomplish this, the altitude is given by the transom's graduations.  If the sun is too high for this, the yard horizontal opening in the socket is loosened and the yard is moved to allow the shadow to land on the 90° mark.  The yard then yields the altitude.

It was a fairly accurate instrument, as the graduations were well spaced compared to a conventional [[cross-staff]].  However, it was a bit unwieldy and difficult to handle in wind.

==Benjamin Cole quadrant==
[[Image:Cole-quadrant.png|thumb|''Figure 7'' – Cole quadrant from 1748.]]  
A late addition to the collection of backstaves in the navigation world, this device was invented by [[Benjamin Cole (instrument maker)|Benjamin Cole]] in 1748.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;

The instrument consists of a staff with a pivoting [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] on one end.  The quadrant has a ''shadow vane'', which can optionally take a lens like the Davis quadrant's Flamsteed glass, at the upper end of the graduated scale (A in ''Figure 7'').  This casts a shadow or projects an image of the sun on the ''horizon vane'' (B).  The observer views the horizon through a hole in the ''sight vane'' (D) and a slit in the horizon vane to ensure the instrument is level.  The quadrant component is rotated until the horizon and the sun's image or shadow are aligned.  The altitude can then be read from the quadrant's scale.  In order to refine the reading, a circular [[vernier scale|vernier]] is mounted on the staff (C).

The fact that such an instrument was introduced in the middle of the 18th century shows that the quadrant was still a viable instrument even in the presence of the [[octant (instrument)|octant]].

[[George Adams (optician)|George Adams Sr.]] created a very similar backstaff at the same time.  Adam's version ensured that the distance between the Flamsteed glass and horizon vane was the same as the distance from the vane to the sight vane.&lt;ref name="hutton"&gt;[[Charles Hutton]], [http://archimedes.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/archim/dict/hw?lemma=QUADRANT&amp;step=entry&amp;id=d006 "A Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross bow quadrant==
[[Image:Cross-bow-quadrant.png|thumb|''Figure 8'' – Drawing of a cross bow quadrant. The 120° arc was graduated as a 90° arc, resulting in divisions that are slightly greater than their nominal arc size.]]
[[Edmund Gunter]] invented the '''cross bow quadrant''', also called the '''mariner's bow''', around 1623.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;  It gets its name from the similarity to the archer's [[crossbow]].

This instrument is interesting in that the arc is 120° but is only graduated as a 90° arc.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;  As such, the angular spacing of a degree on the arc is slightly greater than one degree.  Examples of the instrument can be found with a 0° to 90° graduation or with two mirrored 0° to 45° segments centred on the midpoint of the arc.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;

The instrument has three vanes, a ''horizon vane'' (A in ''Figure 8'') which has an opening in it to observe the horizon, a ''shadow vane'' (B) to cast a shadow on the horizon vane and a ''sighting vane'' (C) that the navigator uses to view the horizon and shadow at the horizon vane.  This serves to ensure the instrument is level while simultaneously measuring the altitude of the sun.  The altitude is the difference in the angular positions of the shadow and sighting vanes.

With some versions of this instrument, the [[Position of the Sun|sun's declination]] for each day of the year was marked on the arc.  This permitted the navigator to set the shadow vane to the date and the instrument would read the altitude directly.

The '''Berkeley Physics Course''' is a series of college-level [[physics]] textbooks written mostly by [[UC Berkeley]] professors.

==Description==
The series consists of the following five volumes, each of which was originally used in a one-semester course at Berkeley:
#''Mechanics'' by [[Charles Kittel]], et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=J. A.|title=Mechanics: Berkeley Physics Course|journal=Science|date=May 7, 1965|volume=148|issue=3671|pages=813&amp;ndash;814|jstor=1716383|doi=10.1126/science.148.3671.813-b }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#''Electricity and Magnetism'' by [[Edward M. Purcell]]
#''Waves'' by Frank S. Crawford, Jr.
#''Quantum Physics'' by [[Eyvind Wichmann|Eyvind H. Wichmann]]
#''Statistical Physics'' by Frederick Reif

Volume 2, ''Electricity and Magnetism'', by Purcell (Harvard), is particularly well known, and was influential for its [[Relativistic electromagnetism|use of relativity]] in the presentation of the subject at the introductory college level. Half a century later the book is still in print, in an updated version by authors Purcell and Morin. The third edition of the text, published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2013, was completely revised and updated to [[International System of Units|SI units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/physics/general-and-classical-physics/electricity-and-magnetism-3rd-edition?format=HB |title=Electricity and Magnetism, 3rd edition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A [[Space race|Sputnik-era]] project funded by a [[National Science Foundation]] grant, the course arose from discussions between [[Philip Morrison]] (then at [[Cornell University]]) and Charles Kittel (Berkeley) in 1961, and was published by [[McGraw-Hill]] starting in 1965. The Berkeley course was contemporary with ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' (a college course at a similar mathematical level), and [[Physical Science Study Committee|PSSC Physics]] (a high school introductory course). These physics courses were all developed in the atmosphere of urgency about science education created in the West by [[Sputnik]].

Because of the government support received, the original editions contained notices on their copyright pages stating that the books were to be available royalty-free after five years. The authors got lump-sum payments but did not receive [[royalties]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Carl Helmholtz, "Faculty governance and physics at the University of California, Berkeley, 1937-1990 : oral history transcript / 1993"&lt;/ref&gt; There was a parallel series of laboratory courses developed by [[Alan M. Portis|Alan Portis]].&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Portis, The Berkeley Physics Laboratory, in New trends in physics teaching, v. 1, 1965-1966, Unesco.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was translated into a number of foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.abebooks.it/BERKELEY-PHYSICS-LABORATORY-2-MECANICA-PORTISYOUNG/17815565098/bd https://www.buscalibre.com.mx/libro-berkeley-physics-laboratory-10-fisica-atomica/47814803/p/47814803&lt;/ref&gt; Although the course was influential in physics education worldwide, the book series sold better in foreign markets than in the US, possibly because students in other countries specialized earlier and were therefore better prepared mathematically than US students.&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz&lt;/ref&gt;  It was felt to be too advanced for typical engineering students at Berkeley, but continued to be used there in [[honors course]]s for physics majors. Adoption may have also been hindered by the choice of [[Gaussian units]] of measurement, and later editions of volumes 1 and 2 were eventually published with the Gaussian system replaced by [[International System of Units|SI units]].

In 2004 Sperling released the 832-page ''Cities Ranked and Rated'', co-authored by Peter Sander and published by John Wiley and Sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperling|first=Bert|title=Cities Ranked &amp; Rated|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=0-7645-2562-X|pages=832|url=https://www.amazon.com/Cities-Ranked-Rated-Metropolitan-Evaluated/dp/076452562X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1316035730&amp;sr=1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sperling and Sander appeared on The Today Show in support of the book.&lt;ref name="Today Show" /&gt;

The 864-page Second Edition of ''Cities Ranked and Rated'' was published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperling|first=Bert|title=Cities Ranked &amp; Rated, 2nd Edition|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-06864-9|pages=864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 464-page ''Best Places to Raise Your Family'' was released in 2006 and again co-authored by Sander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperling|first=Bert|title=Best Places to Raise Your Family|year=2006|publisher=Frommers|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=0471746991|url=https://www.amazon.com/Places-Raise-Family-First-Rated/dp/0471746991/ref=pd_sim_b_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bestplaces.net===

Sperling's interactive "Places, U.S.A." computer program evolved into the [[Sperling's BestPlaces]] (BestPlaces.net) website.  Using quarterly-updated statistics from dozens of sources, the site is a free resource for people across the country seeking to relocate. The site is also used as a recreational learning tool and academic reference.

==In popular culture==
Sperling has been a guest&lt;ref name="Today Show"&gt;{{cite web|title=Think your city is best?|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/4625179/ns/today-travel/t/think-your-city-best-see-latest-rankings/#.T1f0zzGmjng|work=Today Show|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]] and featured&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tugend|first=Alina|title=The Guy Who Picks The Best Places To Live|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/realestate/06cov.html?_r=3&amp;oref=slogin|accessdate=7 March 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[New York Times]]. The results of his studies have been mentioned in "[[The Simpsons]]" animated TV show, "The Tonight Show", as well as in clues in the popular trivia game show "Jeopardy!"

==Controversy==
The Simpsons episode "[[They Saved Lisa's Brain|They Saved Lisa’s Brain]]" (Season 10, Episode 22) generated controversy for its mention of East St. Louis, Illinois as America's least livable city.

In the episode, Comic Book Guy announces that Springfield is 299th on a list of the United States' 300 most livable cities.  East St. Louis is in last place.  A journalist for a "local East St Louis [news]paper" noticed this, and called writer Matt Selman to ask him why they were "taking a shot at East St Louis."  Selman jokingly replied: "because it's a crack-ridden slum."&lt;ref name="Selman"&gt;Selman, Matt. (2007). Commentary for "They Saved Lisa's Brain", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Simpsons staff received several angry letters from East St Louis' residents, demanding an apology.&lt;ref name="Scully"&gt;Scully, Mike.

For example, he entered the United States Tax Code into programmable calculators, which were then used by tax professionals for estate planning.

Sperling was quoted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartimo|first=Jim|title=A 'Real' Computer In Your Lap?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ti4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=%22bert+sperling%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QIJ2To7PArLZiAKfooyzAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bert%20sperling%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=InfoWorld|date=May 7, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the May 7, 1984 issue of [[InfoWorld]] magazine for this expertise on portable computer programming.  InfoWorld also turned to Sperling for his insight on the downfall of early laptop manufacturer [[Gavilan Computer]] in the magazine’s December 3, 1984 issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartimo|first=Jim|title=Gavilan: A $31 Million Venture Capital Nightmare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qS4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=%22bert+sperling%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QIJ2To7PArLZiAKfooyzAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bert%20sperling%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=InfoWorld|date=December 3, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sperling started Fast Forward, Inc. in 1984 and wrote an interactive software program called "Places USA."  It was the first application of its kind, allowing users to weigh their own criteria for what kind of lifestyle, amenities and demographic features were important for them.  It then used these criteria and weightings to produce a list of the user’s ideal place to live, from a pool of the 300 largest metropolitan areas (MSA’s) in the U.S.

An article featuring the "Places USA" program appeared in the newspaper USA Today.  In 1987 the editors of Money Magazine discovered his work and they commissioned him to compile their "Best Cities" lists. He continued to author these Money lists for nearly 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Places to Retire|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bpretire/2007/faq/index.html|publisher=Money Magazine|accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sperling served as a consultant to author William G. Zikmund in the writing of the 1989 book ''Exploring Marketing Research''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zikmund|first=William|title=Exploring Market Research|year=1989|publisher=Dryden Press|location=University of California|isbn=0030229634|pages=824|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dem2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22places+usa%22+sperling&amp;dq=%22places+usa%22+sperling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Places USA" software application continued to be used by researchers as late as 1996, when William Seavey cited the program in his book ''Moving to Small Town America''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seavey|first=William|title=Moving to Small Town America|year=1996|publisher=Real Estate Education Co.|isbn=0793114276|pages=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xdjvc9bk7foC&amp;q=%22places+u.s.a.%22+software&amp;dq=%22places+u.s.a.%22+software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes about Sperling==
[[Richard Florida]], professor at University of Toronto and head of the Rotman School of Management Martin Prosperity Institute said, "you need information based on life stage, job and a cluster and bundle of amenities, such as schools, health care, culture," adding that Sperling "tends to be good at assessing most, if not all, of that."&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

Thomas Wetzel, president of the Retirement Living Information Center in Redding, Connecticut believes the BestPlaces.net website is "the only one that does the comparisons people are looking for."&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

==Data Sources==
For the Bestplaces.net website, as well as the rankings in his books and media studies, Sperling uses a wide variety of data sources.  Most of this data is public domain and compiled by government organizations, providing objectivity and third-party accountability.

Sources include the U.S. Census Bureau, the FBI, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], and the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]].

==Personal life==
Sperling lived in Brooklyn for about a year following his birth. He grew up in San Diego, Oslo, Norway, Key West, Florida, and Carmel, California.&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt;

He graduated from Oregon State University in 1974 with a degree in Engineering. He was recently featured in an article in his alma mater’s alumni magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Kevin|title=College of Business Alum Featured in the Oregon Stater|url=http://business.oregonstate.edu/entrepreneur-residence-november-1-bert-sperling|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After college Sperling moved to Portland, Oregon. He currently splits his time between Portland and Depoe Bay, Oregon. He has two adult sons with his wife Gretchen.

A '''bioshelter''' is a solar [[greenhouse]] managed as an indoor [[ecosystem]].  The word bioshelter was coined by the [[New Alchemy Institute]] and solar designers Sean Wellesley-Miller and Day Chahroudi.&lt;ref name="todd"&gt;Todd, N.J. and Todd J., 1994. From Eco-Cities to Living Machines - Principles of Ecological Design, North Atlantic Books, Berkeley, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was created to distinguish their work in greenhouse design and management from twentieth century [[petro-chemical]] fuelled monoculture greenhouses. 

New Alchemy's pioneering work in [[Ecological Design|ecological design]] is documented in their published Journals and Reports. In 1976 the Alchemists built the Cape Cod Ark bioshelter and her sister The Prince Edward Island Ark.  For the next 15 years the New Alchemy Institute studied and reported on the use of these prototype food producing ecosystems.

A bioshelter (life-shelter) involves two fields of knowledge and design.  The first is architecture designed to nurture an ecosystem within. A bioshelter structure uses glazing to contain and protect the living biology inside, control air exchange and absorb energy.  The building exchanges [[nutrient]]s, gases and energy with the surrounding environment, produces [[crops]], and recycles waste organic material into the soil. &lt;ref name=todd/&gt; Solar energy is stored as heat energy in thermal mass such as water, stone, masonry, soil and plant biomass.    

The second is the biology inside the bioshelter. Earle Barnhart of the New Alchemy Institute has compared a bioshelter to a contained ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart, E. 1978. Biotechnic Strategies in Bioshelters, The Journal of the New Alchemists No. 5, New Alchemy Institute, Falmouth MA&lt;/ref&gt;   Solar heat is absorbed and stored in thermal mass to moderate air temperatures and provide heat for later use.  Water moves from rainfall to fishponds to soil to plants and finally to water vapor. Year-round habitat is provided for beneficial [[insects]] . Ecological relationships between pests and their predators reduce the number of pests. Gases are exchanged among the animals, insects, micro-organisms, soil and plants. Nutrient cycles are developed between [[fish]], plant &amp; soil. Within the bioshelter are a variety of microclimates.  The south areas receive the most direct sunlight.  The east and west areas can be shaded for a portion of the day. Higher levels in a growing space will be warmer.  A well-designed bioshelter, managed by human intelligence, can shelter a community of people, food crops, edible fish, and a diverse ecosystem of plants, animals and soil life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15343">Starting in the early 1990s, [[James F. Moore]] originated the [[strategic planning]] concept of a '''business ecosystem''', now widely adopted in the [[high tech]] community. The basic definition comes from Moore's book, ''[[The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The origins of the concept==
The concept first appeared in Moore's May/June 1993 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, titled "Predators and Prey: A New Ecology of Competition", and won the [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] Award for article of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9vCCtUPpvH8J:www.isc.hbs.edu/mckinsey.pdf+james+moore+1993+mckinsey+award&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi5p3-FjaIXFtwHhFgLk7zc8HukKsFKCUhk17KyhXsWjl2ZBPZOiATTd8LJWia5pJCZRj4xKsTs09f6p0XeZxJZaE3IJFQ5fhcsM9aZEgs6ahQVkQQm_JuL7rsOA_h49yV403Cf&amp;sig=AHIEtbQsPjXx1J8LDyvOVZQBtu41LnVm1w|page=2|title=McKinsey Award Winners for Best ''HBR'' Articles|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore defined "business ecosystem" as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An economic community supported by a foundation of interacting organizations and individuals—the organisms of the business world. The economic community produces goods and services of value to customers, who are themselves members of the ecosystem. The member organisms also include suppliers, lead producers, competitors, and other stakeholders. Over time, they [[coevolve]] their capabilities and roles, and tend to align themselves with the directions set by one or more central companies. Those companies holding leadership roles may change over time, but the function of ecosystem leader is valued by the community because it enables members to move toward shared visions to align their investments, and to find mutually supportive roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Moore|1996|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moore used several ecological [[metaphor]]s, suggesting that the firm is embedded in a (business) environment, that it needs to coevolve with other companies, and that “the particular [[Ecological niche|niche]] a business occupies is challenged by newly arriving species.”&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Moore|1996|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that companies need to become proactive in developing mutually beneficial ("[[symbiotic]]") relationships with customers, suppliers, and even competitors.

Using ecological metaphors to describe business structure and operations is increasingly common especially within the field of information technology (IT). For example, [[J. Bradford DeLong]], a professor of economics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], has written that "business ecosystems" describe “the pattern of launching new technologies that has emerged from [[Silicon Valley]]”.&lt;ref name=delong1&gt;{{
harvnb|DeLong|2000|loc=para. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Cohen|DeLong|Zysman|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines business ecology as “a more productive set of processes for developing and commercializing new technologies” that is characterized by the “rapid prototyping, short product-development cycles, early test marketing, options-based compensation, venture funding, early corporate independence”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|DeLong|2000|loc=para. 6 &amp; 4, respectively}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLong also has expressed that the new way is likely to endure “because it's a better business ecology than the legendarily lugubrious model refined at [[Xerox PARC|Xerox Parc]]—a more productive set of processes for rapidly developing and commercializing new technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|DeLong|2000|loc=para. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangrove Software,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Mangrove|2001|loc=para. 1}}: “(t)he interaction and correlation of economic conditions, technology, customers, employees, corporate partners, shareholders, and competitors forming the environment under which a business operates”.&lt;/ref&gt; The Montague Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{

Kraemer, director of the [[University of California, Irvine]]’s Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Kraemer|1999|loc=para. 11}}: “It is the applications that firms buy or create themselves that bring value-added to the firm and to its business ecology of customers, suppliers and business partners”.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Abram, Vice President of Micromedia, Ltd.,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abram|2000|loc=para. 4}}: has asserted that the Web is “maturing as a business ecology”&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Gruber, co-founder and CTO of Intraspect Software,&lt;ref name=gruber&gt;{{
harvnb|Gruber|loc=para. 4}}: “Imagine that companies are like organisms in an evolutionary landscape”&lt;/ref&gt; Vinod K. Dar, Managing Director of Dar &amp; Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Dar|1999|loc=para. 1}}: “Evolution on the Internet is no different from physical evolution but with vastly compressed life cycles and faster genetic mutation”.&lt;/ref&gt; have all advocated this approach.

==Industries==
Gruber explains that over a century ago, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motors]] did well using methods of mass production, an assembly line, and [[insourcing]]. However, Ford began to outsource its production “[w]hen the ecology evolved.” Gruber (n.d.) has stated that such evolution in the ecology of the business world is “punctuated now and then by radical changes in the environment” and that “globalization and the Internet are the equivalents of large-scale climate change. Globalization is eliminating the traditional advantages of the large corporation: access to capital, access to markets, and economies of scale”.&lt;ref name=gruber/&gt;

The [[application service provider]] (ASP) industry is moving toward relationship networks and focusing on core competencies. “According to the gospel of [[Cisco Systems]], companies inclined to exist together within an “ecosystem” facilitate the imminence of Internet-based application delivery”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Kaminsky|2000|loc=para. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books also use natural systems metaphors without discussing the interfaces between human business and biological ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Baskin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another work defines business ecology as “a new field for sustainable organizational management and design,” one “that is based on the principle that organizations, as living organisms, are most successful when their development and behavior are aligned with their core purpose and values – what we call “social DNA’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abe|Dempsey|Bassett|1998|pp=xii-xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for companies to attend to ecological health is indicated by the following: “Business ecology is based on the elegant structure and principles of natural systems. It recognizes that to develop healthy business ecosystems, leaders and their organizations must see themselves, and their environments, through an “ecological lens”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abe|Dempsey|Bassett|1998|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological ecosystems==
Some environmentalists have used "business ecosystems" as a way to talk about environmental issues as they relate to business rather than as a metaphor to describe the increasing complexity of relationships among companies. According to Townsend, business ecology is the study of the reciprocal relationship between business and organisms and their environments. The goal of this "business ecology" is sustainability through the complete ecological synchronization and integration of a business with the sites that it inhabits, uses, and affects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Townsend|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other environmentalists believe that the ecosystem metaphor is just a way for business to appear 'Green'. According to author [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]], the metaphor is used to make out that somehow business operates using natural principles which should be left to run without interference by governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Nature: Wholeness and Disintegration in Ecology and Science|last = Marshall|first = Alan|publisher = Imperial College Press|year = 2002|isbn = 9781860943300|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed|date=February 2016}}

Far from the most common energy supply, the [[sun]], and from many nutrient supplies closely tied to the surface, the [[deep sea]] is still home to a unique ecosystem. '''Deep-sea wood''' is the term for wood which sinks to the ocean floor. All organisms of the ocean floor face unique challenges in [[Adenosine triphosphate|synthesizing ATP/GTP]] needed for cellular function and replication. In this case, '''deep-sea wood''' supports a unique form of deep sea community life including chemo-synthetic [[bacteria]]. Sources of carbon for these organisms are not limited to wood, but also include [[kelp]] and the remains of [[whales]]. As it is difficult and very costly to simply discover logs that have fallen to the ocean floor, much of what is known about '''deep-sea wood''' is obtained from experiments by marine biologists, in which wood is forced to the bottom of the ocean for a set amount of time and is then collected later for sampling.

==Organisms present==

===Wood boring bivalves===
Colonization experiments revealed the presence of wood boring bivalves that belong to the subfamily Xylophagainae, such as ''Xylophaga dorsalis'',&lt;ref&gt;Bienhold, Christina; Pop Ristova, Petra; Wenzhöfer, Frank; Dittmar, Thorsten &amp; Boetius, Antje.(2 January 2013). [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0053590 ''How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life''], PLoS ONE, {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0053590}}. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; or other species recently described from deep-sea canyons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Romano |first1=Chiara |last2=Voight |first2=Janet Ruth |last3=Perez-Portela |first3=Rocio |last4=Martin |first4=Daniel |title=Morphological and Genetic Diversity of the Wood-Boring Xylophaga (Mollusca, Bivalvia): New Species and Records from Deep-Sea Iberian Canyons |journal=PLoS ONE|date=2014 |volume=9 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0102887 |page=e102887}}&lt;/ref&gt; They range in shell size from 1-10mm. These bivalves are able to digest wood with the help of symbiotic bacteria in their gills.

===Chemosyntheic fauna===
Chemosyntheic muscles identified as ''Idas modiolaeformis'' were also found in deep sea wood when organic matter settled for at least one year. They are slightly smaller than the bivalves found and range in length from 1-6mm.

===Other organisms===
A variety of deep-sea crabs and sea urchins seemed to also be chemically attracted to the wood. There are numerous species of snail that have been discovered on the wood, along with predatory worms and small crustaceans. Their attraction to the wood may be attributed to its bacterial inhabitants serving as a base organism for deep-sea life, with the potential to feed on microorganisms, or other inhabitants of the wood.

==Fungal communities==
Fungi are the major degraders of [[Lignocellulosic biomass|lignocellulose]] in aquatic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyde|first=K.D.|last2=Jones|first2=E. B. G.|last3=Leano|first3=E.|last4=Pointing|first4=S.B.|last5=Poonyth|first5=A.D.|last6=Vrijmoed|first6=L.L.P.|year=1998|title=Role of fungi in marine ecosystems.|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/46139810/a_3A100882351515720160601-22434-c1u3aw.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1490033337&amp;Signature=XxahzMmEhm6uOlvXGsEJesUdF%2Fk%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DRole_of_fungi_in_marine_ecosystems.pdf|journal=Biodiversity and Conservation|volume=7|pages=1147–1161|via=|doi=10.1023/a:1008823515157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In aerobic terrestrial environments, a majority of cellulose breakdown is broken down by [[wood-decay fungus|wood-decay fungi]]&lt;ref&gt;Baldrian P, Valásková V. Degradation of cellulose by basidiomycetous fungi FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2008 May;32(3):501-21. {{doi|10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00106.x}}. Epub 2008 Mar 26.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly and collectively known as white rot and soft rot. Complex enzymes are secreted by the various fungi, converting cellulose into a carbon form that can be utilized by the fungus, and subsequently any organism up the food chain.

==Bacterial communities==
Bacteria also contribute to the digestion of '''deep-sea wood,''' using an alternative method from that of fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leschine | first1 = SB | year = 1995 | title = Cellulose degradation in anaerobic environments | url = | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 399–426 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.49.100195.002151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynd | first1 = LR | last2 = Weimer | first2 = PJ | last3 = van Zyl | first3 = WH | last4 = Pretorius | first4 = IS | year = 2002 | title = Microbial cellulose utilization: Fundamentals and biotechnology (vol 66, pg 506, 2002) | url = https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=13843&amp;content=PDF| journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 739–739 | doi = 10.1128/mmbr.66.4.739.2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to classify bacteria present on deep-sea wood, a variety of different techniques are employed. First, biomass allows scientists to quantify the amount of bacterial growth on a sample. Then DNA extraction and Automated [[Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer analysis]] (ARISA) can be used to identify the strains of bacteria present that are most dominant, and the ones that are present.

While ''Gammaproteobacteria'' dominated the composition of bacteria found on freshly submerged wood, many other bacterial strains populated in response to colonization of the aforementioned wood-boring ''Xylophaga'', which take the large chunks of wood and convert them into fine chips and fecal matter. These processed forms of carbon lead to the growth of many other marine bacteria including ''Alphaproteobacteria'', ''Flavobacteria'', ''Actinobacteria'', ''Clostridia'', and ''Bacteroidetes''.&lt;ref&gt;Bienhold, Christina; Pop Ristova, Petra; Wenzhöfer, Frank; Dittmar, Thorsten &amp; Boetius, Antje.(2 January 2013). [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0053590 ''How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life''], PLoS ONE, {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0053590}}. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wood degradation===

====Presence of anaerobes====
The presence of ''Clostridia'', obligate [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobes]] suggests that the process of degrading the '''deep-sea wood''' may create oxygen-free environments for these bacteria to survive in.&lt;ref&gt;Bienhold, Christina; Pop Ristova, Petra; Wenzhöfer, Frank; Dittmar, Thorsten &amp; Boetius, Antje.(2 January 2013). [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0053590 ''How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life''], PLoS ONE, {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0053590}}. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sulfur reducing bacteria====
Many bacterial strains that were found on '''deep-sea wood''' were [[sulfur-reducing bacteria]], meaning they obtain energy from reducing elemental sulfur, instead of traditionally using the sun for energy like almost all other organisms. Marine biologists suggest they may contribute to the break down of cellulose from the wood.&lt;ref&gt;Bienhold, Christina; Pop Ristova, Petra; Wenzhöfer, Frank; Dittmar, Thorsten &amp; Boetius, Antje.(2 January 2013). [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0053590 ''How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life''], PLoS ONE, {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0053590}}. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variability of organisms== 
The species of wood that falls to the ocean floor produces variability in the organisms present on it. There is also natural viability between organisms found on the same species of tree, which promotes to deep-sea diversity. If fact, a study by marine biologists showed bacterial communities were approximately 75% dissimilar, even as similar logs of the same tree species were placed within the same 500m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area.&lt;ref&gt;Craig McClain, James Barry Beta-diversity on deep-sea wood falls reflects gradients in energy availability {{doi|10.1098/rsbl.2014.0129Published}} 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11439">A '''Dynamic Global Vegetation Model''' (DGVM) is a computer program that [[computer simulation|simulates]] shifts in potential vegetation and its associated [[biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical]] and [[hydrological cycle]]s as a response to shifts in climate. DGVMs use [[time series]] of [[climate]] data and, given constraints of latitude, topography, and soil characteristics, simulate monthly or daily dynamics of ecosystem processes.  DGVMs are used most often to simulate the effects of future [[climate change]] on natural [[vegetation]] and its [[carbon cycle|carbon]] and water cycles.

DGVMs generally combine [[biogeochemistry]], [[biogeography]], and disturbance submodels.  Disturbance is often limited to [[wildfire]]s, but in principle could include any of: forest/land management decisions, [[windthrow]], insect damage, ozone damage etc.  DGVMs usually "spin up" their simulations from bare ground to equilibrium vegetation (e.g. [[climax community]]) to establish realistic initial values for their various "pools": carbon and nitrogen in live and dead vegetation, [[soil organic matter]], etc. corresponding to a documented historical vegetation cover.

DGVMs are usually run in a spatially distributed mode, with simulations carried out for thousands of "cells", geographic points which are assumed to have homogeneous conditions within each cell.  Simulations are carried out across a range of spatial scales, from global to landscape.  Cells are usually arranged as lattice points; the distance between adjacent lattice points may be as coarse as a few degrees of latitude or longitude, or as fine as 30 arc-seconds.  Simulations of the conterminous United States in the first DGVM comparison exercise (LPJ and MC1) called the VEMAP&lt;ref&gt;VEMAP Members. 1995. Vegetation/ecosystem modeling and analysis project: comparing biogeography and biogeochemistry models in a continental-scale study of terrestrial ecosystem responses to climate change and CO2 doubling. Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 9(4):407–437&lt;/ref&gt; project in the 1990s used a lattice grain of one-half degree. Global simulations by the PIK group and collaborators &lt;ref&gt;Cramer, W., A. Bondeau, F.I. Woodward, I.C. Prentice, R. Betts, V. Brovkin, P.M. Cox, V. Fischer, J.A. Foley, A.D. Friend, C. Kucharik, M.R. Lomas, N. Ramankutty, S. Sitch, B. Smith, A. White, and C. Young-Molling. 2001. Global response of terrestrial ecosystem structure and function to CO2 and climate change: results from six dynamic global vegetation models. Global Change Biology 7:357–373&lt;/ref&gt; using 6 different DGVMs (HYBRID, IBIS, LPJ, SDGVM, TRIFFID, and VECODE) used the same resolution as the [[general circulation model]] (GCM) that provided the climate data, 3.75 deg longitude x 2.5 deg latitude, a total of 1631 land grid cells.  Sometimes lattice distances are specified in kilometers rather than angular measure, especially for finer grains, so a project like VEMAP &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/vemap/&lt;/ref&gt; is often referred to as 50&amp;nbsp;km grain.

Several DGVMs appeared in the middle 1990s.  The first was apparently IBIS (Foley et al., 1996), VECODE (Brovkin et al., 1997), followed by several others described below:

Several DGVMs have been developed by various research groups around the world:

The next generation of models – earth system models (ex. CCSM,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccsm.ucar.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; ORCHIDEE,&lt;ref&gt;http://orchidee.ipsl.jussieu.fr/&lt;/ref&gt; JULES,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jchmr.org/jules&lt;/ref&gt; CTEM&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cccma.bc.ec.gc.ca/ctem/&lt;/ref&gt; ) – now includes the important feedbacks from the biosphere to the atmosphere so that vegetation shifts and changes in the carbon and hydrological cycles affect the climate.

DGVMs commonly simulate a variety of plant and soil physiological processes. The processes simulated by various DGVMs are summarized in the table below.  
Abbreviations are: NPP, net [[primary production]]; PFT, plant functional type; SAW, [[soil water|soil available water]]; LAI, [[leaf area index]]; I, [[solar radiation]]; T, [[air temperature]]; Wr, root zone water supply; PET, potential [[evapotranspiration]]; vegc, total live vegetation carbon.

'''Eduard Gustav Honrath''' (11 August 1837, [[Coblenz]] – 19 April 1893, [[Berlin]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[entomologist]] who specialised in [[Lepidoptera]], particularly ''[[Parnassius]]''.

[[Image:BerlinerEntZeit1886XXXPlate6.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Butterfly illustrations by Eduard Honrath]]
Honrath was a well-known [[art dealer]] in Berlin. Among his entomological achievements, he described ''Parnassius graeseri'' (1885) (now ''[[Parnassius bremeri|Parnassius bremeri graeseri]]'' (a subspecies), ''[[Parnassius stenosemus]]'' and ''[[Papilio neumoegeni]]'' (both 1890) in the ''Berliner Entomologische Zeitschrift''. He was a member of the [[Entomological Society of Berlin]], and its president for many years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8451">[[File:Amanita muscaria After Rain.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' has a long and varied history of psychoactive use.]]
'''Ethnomycology''' is the study of the historical uses and sociological impact of [[fungi]] and can be considered a subfield of [[ethnobotany]] or [[ethnobiology]]. Although in theory the term includes fungi used for such purposes as [[tinder]], medicine ([[medicinal mushrooms]]) and food (including [[yeast]]), it is often used in the context of the study of psychoactive mushrooms such as [[psilocybin mushrooms]], the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom, and the [[ergot]] fungus.

American banker [[Robert Gordon Wasson]] pioneered interest in this field of study in the late 1950s, when he and his wife became the first Westerners on record allowed to participate in a mushroom ''[[Velada (Mazatec ritual)|velada]]'', held by the [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] ''[[Curandero|curandera]]'' [[María Sabina]]. The biologist [[Richard Evans Schultes]] is also considered an ethnomycological pioneer.  Later researchers in the field include [[Terence McKenna]], [[Albert Hofmann]], [[Ralph Metzner]], [[Carl Ruck]], [[Blaise Daniel Staples]], [[Giorgio Samorini]], [[Keewaydinoquay Peschel]], [[John Marco Allegro]], [[Clark Heinrich]], [[Jonathan Ott]], and [[Paul Stamets]].

Besides mycological determination in the field, ethnomycology depends to a large extent on [[anthropology]] and [[philology]]. One of the major debates among ethnomycologists is Wasson's theory that the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] mentioned in the [[Rigveda]] of the [[Indo-Aryans]] was the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite book

While Wasson views historical mushroom use primarily as a facilitator for the [[shamanic]] or spiritual experiences core to these rites and traditions, McKenna takes this further, positing that the ingestion of psilocybin was perhaps primary in the formation of language and culture and identifying [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] mushrooms as the original "[[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]]".&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{cite book

The 1990s saw a surge in the recreational use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]] due to a combination of a psychedelic revival in the [[rave]] culture, improved and simplified cultivation techniques, and the distribution of both the mushrooms themselves and information about them via the [[Internet]]. This "mushrooming of mushroom use" has also caused an increased popularization of ethnomycology itself as there are many websites and Internet forums where mushroom references in [[Christmas]] and [[fairy tale]] symbolism are discussed. It remains open to interpretation what effect this popularization has on ethnomycology in the academic world, where the lack of verifiable evidence has kept its theories with their often far-reaching implications shrouded in controversy.

{{Wiktionary|exergonic}}

An '''exergonic process''' is one in which there is a positive flow of energy from the system to the surroundings.  This is in contrast with an [[endergonic]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=exergonic (exoergic) reaction|file= E02262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constant pressure, constant temperature reactions are exergonic [[if and only if]] the [[Gibbs free energy]] change is negative (∆''G''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0).  "Exergonic" (from the prefix exo-, derived for the Greek word ἔξω ''exō'', "outside" and the suffix -ergonic, derived from the Greek word ἔργον ''ergon'', "[[work (thermodynamics)|work]]") means "releasing energy in the form of work".  In thermodynamics, work is defined as the energy moving from the [[system]] (the internal region) to the [[surroundings]] (the external region) during a given process.

All physical and chemical systems in the universe follow the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and proceed in a downhill, i.e., ''exergonic'', direction.  Thus, left to itself, any physical or chemical system will proceed, according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], in a direction that tends to lower the [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the system, and thus to expend energy in the form of work. These reactions occur spontaneously.

A [[chemical reaction]] is also exergonic when spontaneous. Thus in this type of reactions the Gibbs free energy decreases. The [[entropy]] is included in any change of the Gibbs free energy. This differs from a [[exothermic reaction]] or a [[endothermic reaction]] where the entropy is not included. The Gibbs free energy is calculated with the [[Gibbs–Helmholtz equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta G = \Delta H- T \cdot \Delta S&lt;/math&gt;

where:

: ''T'' = temperature in [[kelvin]]s (K)
: Δ''G'' = change in the Gibbs free energy
: Δ''S'' = change in entropy (at 298 K) as Δ''S'' = Σ&lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''S''([[Product (chemistry)|Product]])&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt; − Σ&lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''S''([[Reagent]])&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: Δ''H'' = change in enthalpy (at 298 K) as Δ''H'' = Σ&lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''H''(Product)&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt; − Σ&lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt;''H''(Reagent)&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

A chemical reaction progresses only spontaneously when the Gibbs free energy decreases, in that case the Δ''G'' is negative. In exergonic reactions the Δ''G'' is negative and in [[endergonic]] reactions the Δ''G'' is positive:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_\mathrm{R} G &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; exergon
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_\mathrm{R} G &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; endergon

where: 
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_\mathrm{R} G &lt;/math&gt; equals the change in the Gibbs free energy after completion of a chemical reaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1788">The '''Expression Atlas''' is a database that  provides information on [[gene expression]] patterns. The Expression Atlas allows searches by gene, [[Alternative splicing|splice variant]] and protein attribute. Individual genes or gene sets can be searched for. There are two components to the Expression Atlas, the Baseline Atlas and the Differential Atlas:

== Baseline Atlas ==
The Baseline Atlas provides information about which gene products are present (and at what abundance) under "normal" conditions. This component of the Expression Atlas consists of highly curated and quality-checked [[RNA-Seq|RNA-seq]] experiments from [[ArrayExpress]]. It aims to answer questions such as:

* Which genes are specifically expressed in kidney?
* What is the expression pattern for gene SAA4 in normal tissues?

== Differential Atlas ==
The Differential Atlas allows users to identify genes that are up- or down-regulated in different experimental conditions.

[[File:Air shower detector array of GRAPES-3 experiment.jpg|thumb|250px|right|GRAPES-3 Air Shower Array]]
The '''GRAPES-3 experiment''' (or '''Gamma Ray Astronomy PeV EnergieS phase-3''') located at [[Ooty]] in India started as a collaboration of the Indian [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] and the Japanese [[Osaka City University]], and now also includes the Japanese [[Nagoya Women's University]].

GRAPES-3 is designed to study [[cosmic ray]]s with an array of [[air shower (physics)|air shower]] [[detector]]s and a large area [[muon]] detector. It aims to probe acceleration of cosmic rays in the following four astrophysical settings. These include acceleration of particles to, (i) ~100 MeV in [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[electric field]]s through muons, (ii) ~10 GeV in the [[Solar System]] through muons, (iii) ~1 PeV in [[Milky Way|our galaxy]], (iv) ~100 EeV in the nearby universe through measurement of diffuse [[gamma ray]] flux.

The GRAPES-3 is located at N11.4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, E76.7&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, 2200m above mean sea level. The observations began with 217 plastic [[scintillator]]s and a 560 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area muon detector in 2000. The scintillators detect [[charged particle]]s contained in extensive air showers produced by interaction of high energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere. At present the array is operating with ~400 scintillators that are spread over an area of 25,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The energy threshold of muon detectors is 1 GeV.

==Objectives==
Study of
# The origin, acceleration and propagation of &gt;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; eV cosmic rays in the galaxy and beyond.
# Existence of “Knee” in the energy spectrum of cosmic rays.
# Production and/or acceleration of highest energy (~10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; eV) cosmic rays in the universe.
# Astronomy of multi-TeV γ-rays from neutron stars and other compact object.
# Sun the closest astrophysical object, accelerator of energetic particles and its effects on the Earth.

==Overview==
The first cosmic ray experiment was started in 1955 by [[B. V. Sreekantan]] by setting up [[cloud chamber]]s that heralded the beginning of research at the [[Cosmic Ray Laboratory]] (CRL) in Ooty.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The next decade witnessed a variety of experiments involving high energy interactions and extensive air shower studies in this laboratory. The world's largest multiplate cloud chamber was operated here{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} as part of an air shower array and significant results{{which|date=February 2017}} on the high energy nuclear interactions and cores of extensive air showers were obtained. A triple set-up comprising an air [[Cerenkov radiation|Cerenvok]] counter, a multiplate cloud chamber and a total absorption spectrometer was operated in the early seventies to study the differences in the characteristics of interactions with nuclei of protons and pions in the energy range 10-40 GeV.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} This enabled the time structure study of nuclear active components of air showers and led to the discovery that the nucleon-anti-nucleon production cross-section considerably increases with energy.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In continuation of the work on cosmic ray research at CRL, GRAPES-1 experiment was upgraded in various stages to GRAPES-2. However, due to the technical and administrative problem in its further expansion, a new experiment was set up at the RAC{{clarify|date=February 2017}} site 8&amp;nbsp;km from the old site which is called GRAPES-3. The GRAPES-3 experiment at present is operating with ~400 (each 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) plastic scintillator detectors with a separation of 8 meters, to record the density and arrival time of particles in cosmic ray showers, and in continuous operation.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} At present, GRAPES-3 array is the highest density conventional EAS array in the world,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and also, this experiment associated with a huge 560 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area tracking muon detector, is also the largest area tracking detector anywhere.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Results==
Several results have recently been obtained from the GRAPES-3 experiment on a variety of topics, a few of which are listed below.
* Measurement of primary composition in the energy 50 TeV - 1 PeV overlapping with direct measurements{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* Precision measurements of Forbush decrease events including rigidity dependence of its amplitude{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* Measurement of turbulent magnetic field in the shock-sheath region in the Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) by using multi-rigidity muon data{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* Precision measurement of the solar diurnal anisotropy and its higher harmonics including its rigidity dependence{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* Precision measurement of the density gradient of cosmic rays in the solar system by probing Swinson flow{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* Precision measurement of the anti-correlation between changes in solar wind velocity and cosmic ray intensity{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

'''Google Glass''' is a brand of [[smart glasses]]—an [[optical head-mounted display]] designed in the shape of a pair of eyeglasses. It was developed by [[X (company)|X]] (previously Google X)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://money.cnn.com/2012/04/04/technology/google-project-glass/ |publisher= CNN |work= Money|title= Google unveils 'Project Glass' virtual-reality glasses|last= Goldman|first= David |date= April 4, 2012|accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the mission of producing a [[ubiquitous computing|ubiquitous computer]].&lt;ref name="NYT_2013-02-21" /&gt; Google Glass displayed information in a [[smartphone]]-like, hands-free format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2402613,00.asp |work= PC Magazine|title=Google 'Project Glass' Replaces the Smartphone With Glasses|first=Chloe |last= Albanesius | date=April 4, 2012|accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wearers communicated with the Internet via [[Natural language processing|natural language]] voice commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Google's 'Project Glass' Teases Augmented Reality Glasses|url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/253200/googles_project_glass_teases_augmented_reality_glasses.html |work=PC World|last=Newman|first= Jared| date= April 4, 2012|accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 2012-02-23"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/technology/google-glasses-will-be-powered-by-android.htm |title=Behind the Google Goggles, Virtual Reality|last=Bilton|first=Nick|work=The New York Times|date=February 23, 2012 |accessdate= April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Google started selling a [[prototype]] of Google Glass to qualified "Glass Explorers" in the US on April 15, 2013, for a limited period for $1,500, before it became available to the public on May 15, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-glass-1500-to-buy-80-to-make/|title=Google Glass: $1,500 to buy, $80 to make?|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had an integral 5 [[megapixel]] still/[[720p]] video camera. The headset received a great deal of criticism and legislative action due to privacy and safety concerns. 

On January 15, 2015, Google announced that it would stop producing the Google Glass prototype, to be continued in 2017 tentatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3669927/google-glass-explorer-program-ends/|title=Google Will Stop Selling Glass Next Week|website=Time|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, it was announced that the Google Glass Enterprise Edition would be released.&lt;ref name="Google Glass gets a second chance in factories, where it’s likely to remain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15988258/google-glass-2-enterprise-edition-factories|title=Google Glass is back from the dead|first=Vlad|last=Savov|date=July 18, 2017|website=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Google Glass was developed by Google X,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/04/google-project-glas/ |title=Google's 'Project Glass' Augmented Reality Glasses Are Real and in Testing |work= TechCrunch |last=Velazco|first=Chris|date=April 4, 2012|accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the facility within Google devoted to technological advancements such as [[Autonomous car|driverless cars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/4/2925237/googles-project-glass-augmented-reality-glasses-begin-testing |title= Google's Project Glass augmented reality glasses begin testing|last= Houston|first= Thomas|work= The Verge |date= April 4, 2012|accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Google Glass prototype resembled standard [[glasses|eyeglasses]] with the lens replaced by a [[head-up display]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-04-04/google-project-glass-augmented-reality/54010466/1|last=Hatmaker|first=Taylor|work=USA Today|title=Google shows off Project Glass|date=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2011, Google engineered a prototype that weighed {{convert|8|lb|kg}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/10829574/Google-Glass-goes-on-open-sale-while-stocks-last.html|title=Google Glass goes on open sale - while stocks last|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 2013 they were lighter than the average pair of sunglasses.&lt;ref name="NYT_2013-02-21" /&gt;

In April 2013, the Explorer Edition was made available to [[Google I/O]] developers in the United States for $1,500.&lt;ref name="cnet release"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mack|first=Eric|title=Brin: Google Glass lands for consumers in 2014|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57462641-1/brin-google-glass-lands-for-consumers-in-2014/|work=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=February 21, 2013|date=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Google Glass detail.jpg|thumb|A Glass prototype seen at [[Google I/O]] in June 2012]]
The product was publicly announced in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google Glasses Sound As Crazy As Smartphones And Tablets Once Did |work=Forbes |date=April 5, 2012 |accessdate=April 5, 2012 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2012/04/05/google-glasses-sound-as-crazy-as-smartphones-and-tablets-once-did/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergey Brin]] wore a prototype of the Glass to an April 5, 2012, [[Foundation Fighting Blindness]] event in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/06/nation/la-na-nn-sergey-brin-project-glass-20120406|title=debut on Google co-founder's face|last=Hubbard|first=Amy|date=April 6, 2012|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/6/2929486/googles-project-glass-sergey-brin|title=Google's Sergey Brin takes Project Glass into the wild|last=Bohn|first=Dieter|date=April 6, 2012|work=The Verge|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, Google demonstrated for the first time how Google Glass could be used to shoot videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Google Project Glass video released via Google+|url=http://www.t3.com/news/first-google-project-glass-video-release-via-google-1|work=T3.com|publisher=[[Future plc]]|accessdate=February 22, 2013|date=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google provided four prescription frame choices for $225 and free with the purchase of any new Glass unit. Google entered in a partnership with the Italian eyewear company [[Luxottica]], owners of the [[Ray-Ban]], [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]], and other brands, to offer additional frame designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rhodan|first=Maya|title=Google Glass Getting Ray Ban, Oakley Versions|url=http://time.com/36410/google-glass-ray-ban-oakley/|work=Time|accessdate=March 25, 2014|date=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2014, [[Nepal]] government adopted Google Glass for tackling poachers of wild animals and herbs of [[Chitwan National Park|Chitwan International Park]] and other parks listed under World heritage sites. 
In January 2015, Google ended the beta period of Glass (the "Google Glass Explorer" program).&lt;ref name="BBC News 15 January 2015"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30831128 |title= Google Glass sales halted but firm says kit is not dead |date= January 15, 2015 |website=BBC News | accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BBCRoryCJ/status/555786768029847552|title=Rory Cellan-Jones on Twitter: "Breaking – Google ends Google Glass Explorer programme, stops selling Glass in present form, still hopes to produce other versions in future"|last1=Cellan-Jones|first1=Rory|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Release date ===
In early 2013, interested potential Glass users were invited to use a Twitter message, with hashtag #IfIHadGlass, to qualify as an early user of the product. The qualifiers, dubbed "Glass Explorers" and numbering 8,000 individuals, were notified in March 2013, and were later invited to pay $1,500 and visit a Google office in Los Angeles, New York or San Francisco, to pick up their unit following "fitting" and training from Google Glass guides. On May 13, 2014, Google announced a move to a "more open beta", via its Google Plus page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plus.google.com/111626127367496192147/posts/QLD88fE7qmE|title=More open Beta begins in US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Google Glass was being redesigned by former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] executive [[Tony Fadell]], and that it would not be released until he deemed it to be "perfect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/style/why-google-glass-broke.html |title=Why Google Glass Broke |work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Nick |last=Bilton |date=February 4, 2015 |accessdate=February 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 it was announced that the second iteration, the Google Glass Enterprise Edition, would be released in the US for companies such as [[Boeing]].&lt;ref name="Google Glass gets a second chance in factories, where it’s likely to remain"/&gt;. Google Glass Enterprise Edition has already been successfully used by Dr. Ned Sahin to help children with autism learn social skills.&lt;ref&gt;Sahin NT, Keshav NU, Salisbury JP, Vahabzadeh A Second Version of Google Glass as a Wearable Socio-Affective Aid: Positive School Desirability, High Usability, and Theoretical Framework in a Sample of Children with Autism JMIR Hum Factors 2018;5(1):e1 https://humanfactors.jmir.org/2018/1/e1/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
[[File:A Google Glass wearer.jpg|thumb|right|Google Glass can be controlled using the touchpad built into the side of the device]]

* Touchpad: A touchpad is located on the side of Google Glass, allowing users to control the device by swiping through a timeline-like interface displayed on the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/glass/help/|title=Getting to know Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sliding backward shows current events, such as weather, and sliding forward shows past events, such as phone calls, photos, [[Google+|circle updates]], etc.
* Camera: Google Glass has the ability to take 5 Mp photos and record 720p HD video.&lt;ref name=CameraQuality&gt;{{cite web|title=Acceptable Google Glass Camera Sizes|url=http://stellarbuild.com/blog/article/google-glass-acceptable-video-sizes-for-camera|website=Stellarbuild|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Display: The Explorer version of Google Glass uses a [[liquid crystal on silicon]] (LCoS)(based on an LCoS chip from [[Himax]]), [[field-sequential color system]], [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] illuminated display.&lt;ref name="Guttag"&gt;{{cite web|last=Guttag|first=Karl|title=Proof That Google Glass Uses A Himax LCOS Microdisplay|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/1504292-proof-that-google-glass-uses-a-himax-lcos-microdisplay|accessdate=February 4, 2014|date=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The display's LED illumination is first [[Polarization_(waves)#s_and_p_designations|P-polarized]] and then shines through the in-coupling [[polarizing beam splitter]] (PBS) to the LCoS panel. The panel reflects the light and alters it to S-polarization at [[active pixel sensor]] sites. The in-coupling PBS then reflects the S-polarized areas of light at 45° through the out-coupling beam splitter to a [[collimator|collimating reflector]] at the other end. Finally, the out-coupling beam splitter (which is a partially reflecting mirror, not a polarizing beam splitter) reflects the collimated light another 45° and into the wearer's eye.&lt;ref name="US20130070338"&gt;{{US patent application|20130070338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US20130207887"&gt;{{US patent application|20130207887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazra"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hazra|first1=Sid|title=How does Google Glass project the image onto the glass?|url=https://www.quora.com/How-does-Google-Glass-project-the-image-onto-the-glass#dOumOL|publisher=Quora|date=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applications ===
Google Glass applications are free applications built by third-party developers. Glass also uses many existing Google applications, such as [[Google Now]], [[Google Maps]], [[Google+]], and [[Gmail]]. Many developers and companies have built applications for Glass, including news apps, [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]], exercise, photo manipulation, translation, and sharing to social networks, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/05/14/glass-apps/|title=7 Standout Google Glass Apps You Can Download Right Now|date=May 14, 2013|work=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/05/14/mashable-launches-velocity-for-google-glass/|title=Mashable Launches Google Glass Viral Prediction App|date=May 14, 2013|publisher=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AllThingsD, Nov 19"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20131119/new-google-glass-apps-will-translate-the-world-from-your-eyes-and-other-tricks|title=Next Google Glass Tricks Include Translating the World From Your Eyes|last=Gannes|first=Liz|date=November 19, 2013|work=[[All Things Digital]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-party applications announced at [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW) include [[Evernote]], [[Plasq#Skitch|Skitch]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', and [[Path (social network)|Path]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.engadget.com/2013/03/11/google-glass-apps-gmail-new-york-times-path/ |title=Google shows off Glass apps: New York Times, Gmail, Path, and more|last=Santos|first=Alexis|work=Engadget|date=March 11, 2013 |accessdate= April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, 2013, Google released the Mirror API, allowing developers to start making apps for Glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Mirror API Overview|url=https://developers.google.com/glass/about |publisher= Google |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview|url= https://developers.google.com/glass/overview |publisher=Google|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the terms of service, it was stated that developers may not put ads in their apps or charge fees;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developer Preview Google Mirror API Terms of Service|url= https://developers.google.com/glass/terms|publisher= Google|accessdate= April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Google representative told The Verge that this might change in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Blagdon |first=Jeff|title=Google Glass developers prohibited from using ads or charging for apps|url= https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/15/4228962/google-glass-mirror-api-documentation |work=The Verge|publisher= The Verge |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2013, Google announced the release of seven new programs, including reminders from Evernote, fashion news from ''Elle'', and news alerts from [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cain |first= Claire | type = [[World Wide Web]] log | url= http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/new-apps-arrive-on-google-glass/ |title= New Apps Arrive on Google Glass | work = Bits | publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=June 15, 2013 |date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Google's XE7 Glass Explorer Edition update in early July 2013, evidence of a "Glass Boutique", a store that will allow synchronization to Glass of [[Google Glassware|Glassware]] and [[APK (file format)|APKs]], was noted.&lt;ref name="Slash"&gt;{{cite web |title= Glass Boutique app store, MP3 player, Lock-screen &amp; more revealed|url=http://www.slashgear.com/glass-boutique-app-store-mp3-player-lock-screen-more-revealed-05289182/ |work=SlashGear |accessdate=July 6, 2013| first =Chris | last = Davies|date=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version XE8 made a debut for Google Glass on August 12, 2013. It brings an integrated video player with playback controls, the ability to post an update to Path, and lets users save notes to Evernote. Several other minute improvements include volume controls, improved voice recognition, and several new Google Now cards.

On November 19, 2013, Google unveiled its Glass Development Kit, showcasing a translation tool [[Word Lens]], a cooking program AllTheCooks, and an exercise program [[Strava]] among others as successful examples.&lt;ref name="Wired, Nov 19"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/11/google-glass-sdk|title=Google’s New Tools Show How Deep Glass Will Embed in Our Lives|last=Honan|first=Mat|date=November 19, 2013|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]: Gadget Lab}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNET, Nov 19"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57613010-93/google-glass-throws-open-its-doors-to-developers |last= Rosenblatt |first= Seth |title= Google Glass throws open its doors to developers|work=[[CNET]]|date=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google announced three news programs in May 2014 – TripIt, FourSquare and OpenTable – in order to entice travelers. On June 25, 2014, Google announced that notifications from [[Android Wear]] would be sent to Glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.techhive.com/article/2369142/google-glass-will-get-android-wear-notifications.html |title = Google Glass will get Android Wear notifications|date = June 25, 2014|accessdate = July 5, 2014|website = TechHive |last = Newman|first = Jared}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European University Press]] published the first book to be read with Google Glass on October 8, 2014, as introduced at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]]. The book can be read as a normal paper book or – enriched with multimedia elements – with Google Glass, Kindle, on Smartphone and Pads on the platforms iOS and Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's first book to be read with GoogleGlass|url=http://universitypress.eu/_images/press_2014_10_09.pdf|date=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MyGlass ===
Google offers a companion Android and iOS app called MyGlass, which allows the user to configure and manage the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.glass.companion |title= MyGlass | work = Android Apps | publisher = Google Play}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voice activation ===
Other than the touchpad, Google Glass can be controlled using just "voice actions". To activate Glass, wearers tilt their heads 30° upward (which can be altered for preference) or simply tap the touchpad, and say "O.K., Glass." Once Glass is activated, wearers can say an action, such as "Take a picture", "Record a video", "Hangout with [person/Google+ circle]", "Google 'What year was Wikipedia founded?'", "Give me directions to the Eiffel Tower", and "Send a message to John"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Support |url= https://support.google.com/glass/answer/3079305 |title= Voice actions: "ok glass" | publisher = Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; (many of these commands can be seen in a product video released in February 2013).&lt;ref name="how it feels through glass"&gt;{{cite web|title=How It Feels [through Glass]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1uyQZNg2vE|work= You Tube |publisher= Google |accessdate= February 22, 2013|date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For search results that are read back to the user, the voice response is relayed using [[bone conduction]] through a transducer that sits beside the ear, thereby rendering the sound almost inaudible to other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/02/google-glass-review-augmented-reality|title=Google Glass – hands-on review|last=Arthur|first=Charles|date=July 2, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in medicine  ==

=== In hospitals ===
Augmedix developed an app for the wearable device that allows physicians to live-stream the patient visit and claims it will eliminate [[electronic health record]] problems, possibly saving them up to 15 hours a week&lt;ref name="Charlotte Observer"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/health-family/karen-garloch/article45336984.html | title = Charlotte doctor: Google Glass saves time, helps me focus on patients| newspaper = Charlotte Observer | accessdate = November 18, 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and improving record quality. The video stream is passed to remote [[scribes]] in [[HIPAA]] secure rooms where the doctor-patient interaction is transcribed. Ultimately, allowing physicians to focus on the patient. Hundreds of users&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{Citation|title=Google Glass Comes to Doctor’s Office Near You as Upgrade Looms|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-20/google-glass|newspaper=Bloomberg|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were evaluating the app as of mid-2015.&lt;ref name="MIT Technology Review"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/539606/google-glass-finds-a-second-act-at-work/ | title = Google Glass Finds a Second Act at Work | newspaper = MIT Technology Review | accessdate = July 24, 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, [[Lucien Engelen]] commenced research on the usability and impact of Google Glass in the [[health care]] field. As of August 2013, Engelen, based at [[Singularity University]] and in Europe at [[Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre]], was the first healthcare professional in Europe to participate in the Glass Explorer program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futuremed2020.com/faculty/|title=Faculty|publisher=FutureMed 2020|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research on Google Glass (starting August 9, 2013) was conducted in operating rooms, ambulances, a trauma helicopter, general practice, and home care as well as the use in public transportation for visually or physically impaired.  Research included taking pictures, videos streaming to other locations, dictating operative log, having students watch the procedures and tele-consultation through [[Google Hangout|Hangout]]. Engelen documented his findings in blogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130815203138-19886490-google-glas-in-or|title=Is Google Glass Useful in the Operating Room?|author=Čeština|publisher=Linked In|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; videos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZtNO2OnSqY|title=Google Glass in Operating Room @umcn|work=You Tube|publisher=Google|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; pictures, on [[Twitter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/reshapeglass|title=REshapewithGlass (REshapeglass)|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Google+]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/u/0/100279561102106001682/|title=REshape withglass|work=Plus|publisher=Google|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with research ongoing as of that date. 

In June 2014, Google Glass' ability to acquire images of a patient's retina ("Glass [[Fundoscopy]]") was publicly demonstrated for the first time at the Wilmer Clinical Meeting at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine by Dr. Aaron Wang and Dr. Allen Eghrari.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Course detail|url=http://www.hopkinscme.edu/CourseDetail.aspx/80033274|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140909201538/http://www.hopkinscme.edu/CourseDetail.aspx/80033274|deadurl=yes|publisher=Hopkins CME|archivedate=September 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was featured on the cover of the Journal for Mobile Technology in Medicine for January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Google glass indirect Ophthalmoscopy|url=http://www.journalmtm.com/2015/google-glass-indirect-ophthalmoscopy/|year=2015|journal=MTM}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors Phil Haslam and Sebastian Mafeld demonstrated the first application of Google Glass in the field of interventional radiology.  They demonstrated how Google Glass could assist a liver biopsy and [[fistulaplasty]], and the pair stated that Google Glass has the potential to improve patient safety, operator comfort, and procedure efficiency in the field of interventional radiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whichmedicaldevice.com/editorial/article/390/google-glass-finding-true-clinical-value|title=Google Glass: Finding True Clinical Value|last1=Haslam|first1=Phil|last2=Mafeld|first2=Sebastian|date=October 31, 2013|work=Which Medical Device|accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In surgical procedures ===
On June 20, 2013, Rafael J. Grossmann, a Venezuelan doctor practicing in the U.S., was the first surgeon to demonstrate the use of Google Glass during a live surgical procedure.&lt;ref name="Inside The Operating Room With Google Glass"&gt;{{cite news|title= Inside The Operating Room With Google Glass|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnosta/2013/06/21/google-glass-in-the-operating-room/ |accessdate=December 18, 2013|date= June 21, 2013 |work=Forbes|first=John|last=Nosta}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, Google Glass was used at [[Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University]].  Surgeon Dr. Christopher Kaeding used Google Glass to consult with a distant colleague in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. A group of students at The Ohio State University College of Medicine also observed the operation on their laptop computers. Following the procedure, Kaeding stated, "To be honest, once we got into the surgery, I often forgot the device was there.

=== Brain Power ===
{{Update|reason= No results are reported, after more than a year|date=November 2018}}

Several groups began developing Google Glass based technologies to help children with [[autism]] learn about emotion and facial expressions. The first of these was developed by Brain Power who published the first academic paper on the use of Google Glass technology in children with autism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Runpeng|last2=Salisbury|first2=Joseph P.|last3=Vahabzadeh|first3=Arshya|last4=Sahin|first4=Ned T.|date=2017|title=Feasibility of an Autism-Focused Augmented Reality Smartglasses System for Social Communication and Behavioral Coaching|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fped.2017.00145/full|journal=Frontiers in Pediatrics|language=English|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fped.2017.00145|issn=2296-2360}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2.kqed.org/futureofyou/2015/09/11/can-this-google-glass-app-help-kids-with-autism/|title=Can This Google Glass App Help Kids With Autism?|author=Jessica Carew Kraft|publisher=KQED|work=KQED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbspulse.com/2015/12/28/brain-power-wearable-devices-autism/?curator=MediaREDEF#.bordkq:I5DO|title=Brain Power Creates First Wearable Neuro-Assistive Devices For Autism|author=CBS|publisher=CBS|work=Small Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain Power launched a clinical trial in 2017 known as the "Be Yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brain-power.com/clinicaltrial/|title=Clinical Trials|last=Sahin|first=Ned|date=2017-06-25|work=BRAIN POWER|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain Power was founded by Dr. Ned T.

Sahin based the entire clinical trial upon the concept that every child or adult with autism is different. In order to gather this research he travelled into neighborhoods and visited schools.  There, he was able to develop a more visual understanding of just a few of the daily challenges children with autism face. Dr. Ned T. Sahin states that he’s "not anticipating that children will use the solution 24/7. Rather, just like a parent and child may read together for an hour, they’ll spend an hour a day interacting with each other while the child wears customized Google Glass".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medtechboston.medstro.com/blog/2014/12/29/empowered-brain-a-google-glass-based-solution-for-autism/|title=Empowered Brain: A Google Glass-Based Solution For Autism|date=2014-12-29|work=MedTech Boston|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial is based on self sufficiency and focuses on "skills including emotion decoding, eye contact, speech, conversation skills, behavior and self-regulation, avoiding stress and meltdowns".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brain-power.com/clinicaltrial/|title=Clinical Trials|last=Sahin|first=Ned|date=2017-06-25|work=BRAIN POWER|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A category formation tool on this device, which rewards autistic individuals for properly labeling images that are shown to them. These could include images such as an apple or various animals. Another tool for these images could be a consistent image that represents a calm or soothing emotion, while could result in stress levels decreasing. Many families have had positive experiences with this technology, but has not proven to be a permanent solution for any trial member.

=== Google Glass Project ===
Recently Stanford Research has developed the Google Glass Project there is a team working on finding a way to utilize Google Glass as a tool for behavioral therapy for individuals with autism. This research has been controversial given a lack of reproducibility and transparency &lt;ref&gt;https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/profiles/dennis-wall-became-bad-boy-autism-research/&lt;/ref&gt;. As team manager Dennis Wall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/service/brain-and-behavior/google-glass|title=Google Glass may help kids with autism - Stanford Children's Health|website=www.stanfordchildrens.org|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated,"We have developed a system using machine learning and artificial intelligence to automate facial expression recognition that runs on wearable glasses and delivers real-time social cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://autismglass.stanford.edu|title=Autism Glass Project|last=University|first=Stanford|website=autismglass.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;" An outward-facing camera visually displays facial expressions and developed a system to calculate eye contact. Catalin Voss, founder of the Autism Glass Project stated how flashcards are utilized,"But that doesn't always translate to real-life situations," he said. "Our idea was to try to build a more holistic aid that enables the user to recognize social cues when they actually need to receive those cues right then and there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/22/a-new-use-for-google-glass-helping-children-with-autism-understand-emotion.html|title=A new use for Google Glass: Helping children with autism understand emotion|last=Pettitt|first=Jeniece|date=2016-09-22|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;" 
Currently the trial is simply testing the facial expression identification theory. Two participants have publicly identified in the media where they have declared some positive and encouraging experiences.&lt;ref name="Hoshaw2016"/&gt; One of the participants, an American teenage girl with autism, said, “It’s helped me to understand some people’s emotions. I can tell when a friend is upset better now than I could before.&lt;ref name="Hoshaw2016"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Lindsey|last=Hoshaw|url=https://ww2.kqed.org/futureofyou/2016/06/23/google-glass-flopped-but-kids-with-autism-are-using-it-to-learn-emotions/||title=Google Glass Flopped. But Kids With Autism Are Using It to Recognize Emotions|date=2016-06-23|work=KQED|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of February 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/service/brain-and-behavior/google-glass|title=Google Glass may help kids with autism - Stanford Children's Health|website=www.stanfordchildrens.org|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Google Glass released the public statement regarding the newly designed timeline of the program. This statement declared "over the course of four months, the kids and their families will participate in the therapy. During three 20-minute sessions per day, anything a child sees while wearing Glass is recorded and saved onto a smartphone app developed by the lab. Kids and parents can then review the footage together, and the parents can point out the emotions they were feeling at specific moments. As this occurs, corresponding color-coded bars at the bottom of the screen are linked to those feelings. A red bar at the bottom of the screen means someone is upset, for example, and a yellow bar indicates they are happy … These color-coded videos help kids remember what emotions they saw and in what context." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/service/brain-and-behavior/google-glass|title=Google Glass may help kids with autism - Stanford Children's Health|website=www.stanfordchildrens.org|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, this statement highlights that the Google Glass journey is very family oriented, which in most cases leads to the best results. Google glass is proving to be a powerful tool for social interaction improvements due to the strong technology and versatile presentation either smartphones or as glasses.&lt;ref name="Hoshaw2016"/&gt;

== Media coverage ==

=== Journalism ===
In 2014, [[Voice of America]] Television Correspondent Carolyn Presutti and VOA Electronics Engineer Jose Vega began a web project called "VOA &amp; Google Glass," which explored the technology's potential uses in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.voanews.com/info/voa-reports-with-google-glass/4728.html | work=Voice of America | title=VOA &amp; Google Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series of news stories examined the technology's live reporting applications, including conducting interviews and covering stories from the reporter's point of view. On March 29, 2014, American [[a cappella]] group [[Pentatonix]] partnered with Voice of America when lead singer Scott Hoying wore Glass in the band's performance at [[DAR Constitution Hall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], during the band's worldwide tour – the first use of Glass by a lead singer in a professional concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.voanews.com/media/video/1890395.html | work=Voice of America | title=Pentatonix Gives Google Glass a Try}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2014, The [[University of Southern California]] conducted a course called "Glass Journalism," which explored the device's application in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glassjournalism.tumblr.com/|title=USC – Glass Journalism|work=Tumblr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] as of mid-2014 used Google Glass and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s to track various animals and birds in the jungle, which may be the first use of the device by a non-profit, Non-governmental Organization (NGO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/google-glass-drones-assist-nepal-fighting-poachers-protected-areas-1618460|title=Google Glass used by WWF in Nepal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public events  ===
In 2014, the International Olympic Committee Young Reporters program took [http://andymiah.net/the-google-glass-experiments/ Google Glass to the Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games] and put them on a number of athletes from different disciplines to explore novel point of view filmmaking.

A visually impaired dancer, Benjamin Yonattan, used Google Glass to overcome his chronic vision condition. In 2015, Yonattan performed on the reality television program ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.androidheadlines.com/2015/06/google-glass-helps-blind-dancer-during-talent-audition.html|title=Google Glass Helps Blind Dancer During Talent Audition|last=Anin|first=John|date=4 Jun 2015|newspaper=androidheadlines.com|access-date=29 Mar 2016|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

=== Privacy concerns ===
Concerns have been raised by various sources regarding the intrusion of privacy, and the [[etiquette]] and [[ethics]] of using the device in public and recording people without their permission.&lt;ref name=TG01&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/06/google-glass-threat-to-our-privacy|title=Google Glass: is it a threat to our privacy?|first=Charles |last=Arthur|date=March 6, 2013|work=The Guardian |accessdate=March 7, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/google-glass-say-goodbye-to-your-privacy-1134796|title=Google Glass: say goodbye to your privacy|first=Gary|last=Marshall|date=March 1, 2013|work=techradar.com |accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Warman|first=Matt|title=Google Glass: we'll all need etiquette lessons|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/10015697/Google-Glass-well-all-need-etiquette-lessons.html|accessdate=April 25, 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph (UK)|date=April 24, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, claims that Glass could be seen as a way to become even more isolated in public, but the intent was quite the opposite: Brin views checking social media as a constant "nervous tic," which is why Glass can notify the user of important notifications and updates and does not obstruct the line of sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sergey_brin_why_google_glass|title=Sergey Brin: Why Google Glass? – TED Talk – TED.com|author=Sergey Brin|work=ted.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there is controversy that Google Glass would cause [[security]] problems and violate [[privacy]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/info-tech/controversy-grows-over-googles-glass-project/article4553860.ece|title=Controversy grows over Google’s Glass project|date=March 27, 2013|newspaper=The Hindu Business Line|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google Glass will make 'privacy impossible' warn 'Stop The Cyborgs' campaigners|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-glass-will-make-privacy-impossible-warn-stop-the-cyborgs-campaigners-8550499.html|accessdate=July 6, 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=March 26, 2013|author=Rob Williams|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google Glass security failings may threaten owner's privacy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/01/google-glass-security-privacy-risk|accessdate=July 6, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=May 1, 2013|author=Charles Arthur|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations like the [[FTC Fair Information Practice]] work to uphold privacy rights through Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPS), which are guidelines representing concepts that concern fair information practice in an electronic marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/what-we-do|title=What We Do|work=ftc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy advocates are concerned that people wearing such eyewear may be able to identify strangers in public using facial recognition, or surreptitiously record and broadcast private conversations.&lt;ref name="NYT_2013-02-21" /&gt; The "Find my Face" feature on Google+ functions to create a model of your face, and of people you know, in order to simplify tagging photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/plus/answer/2370300?hl=en|title=See photos you're tagged in|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the only current app that can identify strangers is called MORIS (Mobile Offender Recognition and Identification System), and is a $3,000 iPhone app used by police officers.

Some companies in the US have posted anti-Google Glass signs in their establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Streitfeld|first=David|title=Google Glass Picks Up Early Signal: Keep Out|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/technology/personaltech/google-glass-picks-up-early-signal-keep-out.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=The New York Times  |date=May 6, 2013|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/science/20130326/180266456/Google-Glass-Sees-Preemptive-Pushback-in-US.html|title=Google Glass Sees Preemptive Pushback in US|work=RIA NOVOSTI|accessdate=May 9, 2013|date=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, prior to the official release of the product, Stephen Balaban, co-founder of software company Lambda Labs, circumvented Google’s facial recognition app block by building his own, non-Google-approved operating system.

In February 2013, a Google+ user noticed legal issues with Glass and posted in the Glass Explorers community about the issues, stating that the device may be illegal to use according to the current legislation in Russia and Ukraine, which prohibits use of spy gadgets that can record video, audio or take photographs in an inconspicuous manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://korrespondent.net/lifestyle/gadgets/1521949-ukraincy-ne-smogut-legalno-kupit-ochki-google-glass-iz-za-zapreta-na-shpionskie-gadzhety|title=Украинцы не смогут легально купить очки Google Glass из-за запрета на "шпионские" гаджеты|date=March 13, 2013|publisher=Korrespondent.net|language=Russian|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns were also raised in regard to the privacy and security of Glass users in the event that the device is stolen or lost, an issue that was raised by a US congressional committee. As part of its response to the committee, Google stated that a locking system for the device is in development. Google also reminded users that Glass can be remotely reset.&lt;ref name="Slash" /&gt; Police in various states have also warned Glass wearers to watch out for muggers and street robbers.&lt;ref name="bp"&gt;{{cite web|title=US Police issues warnings for Google Glass Users over Muggery|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/04/us-police-issues-warnings-for-google-glass-users-over-muggery/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa A. Goldstein, a freelance journalist who was born deaf, tested the product on behalf of people with disabilities and published a review on August 6, 2013. In her review, Goldstein states that Google Glass does not accommodate hearing aids and is not suitable for people who cannot understand speech. Goldstein also explained the limited options for customer support, as telephone contact was her only means of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Glass: Not for the Hearing Impaired|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/05/google-glass-hearing-impaired/|work=Mashable|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=August 6, 2013|author=Lisa A. Goldstein|date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several facilities have banned the use of Google Glass before its release to the general public, citing concerns over potential privacy-violating capabilities. Other facilities, such as [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casinos, banned Google Glass, citing their desire to comply with Nevada state law and common gaming regulations which ban the use of recording devices near gambling areas.&lt;ref name=Caesars&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Matt|title=Google Glass Violates Nevada Law, Says Caesars Palace|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/08/google-glass-violates-nevada-law-says-caesars-palace|publisher=IGN|accessdate=June 1, 2013|date=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 29, 2014, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) announced a ban on wearable technology including Google Glass, placing it under the same rules as mobile phones and video cameras.&lt;ref name=MPAA&gt;{{cite web|last=MPPA|first=|title=MPAA and NATO Announce Updated Theatrical Anti-Theft Policy|url=http://www.mpaa.org/mpaa-and-nato-announce-updated-theatrical-anti-theft-policy/|publisher=MPAA|accessdate=November 7, 2014|date=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been concerns over potential eye pain caused by users new to Glass.&lt;ref name="betabeat"&gt;[http://betabeat.com/2014/05/googles-eye-doctor-admits-glass-can-cause-pain/ Google’s Eye Doctor Admits Glass Can Cause Pain] Betabeat.com Jack Smith May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns were validated by Google's optometry advisor Dr. Eli Peli of [[Harvard]], though he later partly backtracked due to the controversy which ensued from his remarks.&lt;ref name=betabeat /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://betabeat.com/2014/05/google-glass-eye-doctor-backtracks-after-speaking-out-about-eye-pain/ Google Glass Eye Doctor Backtracks After Speaking Out About Eye Pain] Betabeat.com Jack Smith May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com.au/google-glass-complaints-2014-5 The Doctor Who Said Google Glass Causes Eye Pain Now Says There's 'No Evidence' Of Health Risks] BusinessInsider.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been raised by cyber forensics experts at the [[University of Massachusetts]] who have developed a way to steal smartphone and tablet passwords using Google Glass. The specialists developed a software program that uses Google Glass to track finger shadows as someone types in their password. Their program then converts the touchpoints into the keys they were touching, allowing them to catch the passcodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fink|first=Erica|title=Google Glass wearers can steal your password|url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/07/07/technology/security/google-glass-password-hack/index.html?iid=HP_River|publisher=[[CNNMoney]]|accessdate=July 8, 2014|date=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern regarding the camera application raises controversy to privacy. Some people are concerned about how the product has the capability of recording during events such as conversations. The device sets off a light to indicate that it is recording but many speculate that there will be an app to disable this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-google-glass-is-creepy/|title = Why Google Glass Is Creepy|last = Pogue|first = David|date = May 14, 2013|journal = Scientific American|accessdate = October 28, 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety considerations ===
Concerns have also been raised on operating motor vehicles while wearing the device. On July 31, 2013 it was reported that driving while wearing Google Glass was likely to be banned in the UK, being deemed careless driving, therefore a fixed penalty offense, following a decision by the [[Department for Transport]].&lt;ref name="telegraph glass ban 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10214822/Drivers-to-be-banned-from-wearing-Google-Glass.html|title=Drivers to be banned from wearing Google Glass|newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]]|first=David|last=Millward|date=July 31, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[West Virginia]] state representative [[Gary Howell|Gary G. Howell]] introduced an amendment in March 2013 to the state's law against texting while driving that would include bans against "using a wearable computer with head mounted display." In an interview, Howell stated, "The primary thing is a safety concern, it [the glass headset] could project text or video into your field of vision. I think there's a lot of potential for distraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/25/tech/innovation/google-glass-driving/index.html?hpt=hp_c3|title=Lawmaker: Google Glass and driving don't mix|newspaper=CNN|first=Brandon|last=Griggs|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, a driver in [[California]] was ticketed for "driving with monitor visible to driver (Google Glass)" after being pulled over for speeding by a [[San Diego Police Department]] officer. The driver was reportedly the first to be fined for driving while wearing a Google Glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3020899/fast-feed/california-driver-gets-a-ticket-for-wearing-google-glass-behind-the-wheel|title=California Driver Gets a Ticket for Wearing Google Glass Behind the Wheel|work=|publisher=Fast Company &amp; Inc|first=Christina|last=Chaey|date=October 30, 2013|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the judge noted that "Google Glass fell under 'the purview and intent' of the ban on driving with a monitor", the case was thrown out of court due to lack of proof the device was on at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25764674|title=Google Glass driver Abadie has case dropped|work=|publisher=BBC News|date=January 17, 2014|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Sawyer et al., from the [[University of Central Florida]] and the US [[Air Force Research Laboratory]], published the results of comparative study in a [[driving simulator]]. Subjects were asked to use either Google Glass or a smartphone-based messaging interface and were then interrupted with an emergency event. The Glass-delivered messages served to moderate but did not eliminate distracting [[Cognitive load|cognitive demands]]. A potential passive cost to drivers merely wearing the Glass was also observed. Messaging using either device impaired driving as compared to driving without multi-tasking.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, B.D., Finomore, V.S., Calvo, A.A. and Hancock, P.A., “Google Glass: A Driver Distraction Cause or Cure?” in ‘’[[Human Factors (journal)|Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society]]’’, November 2014, 56: pp. 1307–1321, {{doi|10.1177/0018720814555723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, a woman wearing Google Glass claimed she was verbally and physically assaulted at a bar in San Francisco after a patron confronted her while she was showing off the device, allegedly leading a man accompanying her to physically retaliate. Witnesses suggested that patrons were upset over the possibility of being recorded.&lt;ref name=CBSSF&gt;{{cite web|last=Vazquez|first=Joe|title=Woman Wearing Google Glass Says She Was Attacked In San Francisco Bar|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/02/25/woman-wearing-google-glass-says-she-was-attacked-in-san-francisco-bar/|publisher=CBSSF|accessdate=November 7, 2014|date=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terms of service ===
Under the Google Glass terms of service for the Glass Explorer pre-public release program, it specifically states, "You may not resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person. If you resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person without Google's authorization, Google reserves the right to deactivate the device, and neither you nor the unauthorized person using the device will be entitled to any refund, product support, or product warranty."
''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' commented on this policy of a company claiming ownership of its product after it had been sold, saying: "Welcome to the New World, one in which companies are retaining control of their products even after consumers purchase them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Google Is Forbidding Users From Reselling, Loaning Glass Eyewear |date = April 17, 2013 |url = https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/04/google-glass-resales/ |accessdate = April 17, 2013 |work=Wired |first=David |last=Kravets}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others pointed out that Glass was not for public sale at all, but rather in private testing for selected developers, and that not allowing developers in a closed beta to sell to the public is not the same as banning consumers from reselling a publicly released device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suleman|first=Khidr|title= Google bans developers from selling Glass headset |url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/19645/google-bans-developers-selling-glass-headset|work= IT Pro |accessdate= July 2, 2013|date=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==

In December, 2016 Hakuto decided to share some costs with [[Team Indus]] and launch their two rovers  together on the proven [[PSLV]] launcher of [[ISRO]]. The launch was initially scheduled for 28 December 2017,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a14761335/airplanes-space-missions-nasa-launches-2018/?src=nl&amp;mag=pop&amp;list=nl_pnl_news&amp;date=010818 15 Air and Space Missions We're Excited for In 2018] Popular Mechanics 6 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and then delayed to March 2018.&lt;ref name=Sorato/&gt;  The media reported in 9 January 2018 that ISRO cancelled the launch contract with TeamIndus and Hakuto.&lt;ref&gt;[https://inc42.com/buzz/google-lunar-xprize-teamindus-isro/ Google Lunar Xprize: ISRO Calls Off Contract With TeamIndus]. 9 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, 2018, X Prize founder and chairman Peter Diamandis stated "After close consultation with our five finalist Google Lunar X Prize teams over the past several months, we have concluded that no team will make a launch attempt to reach the moon by the March 31, 2018, deadline... and the US$30 million Google Lunar XPRIZE will go unclaimed."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.space.com/39467-google-lunar-xprize-moon-race-ends.html Ex-Prize: Google's $30 Million Moon Race Ends with No Winner].

'''[[Invasive species]]''' are a significant threat to many native habitats and species of the [[United States]] and a significant cost to agriculture, forestry, and recreation. The term "invasive species" can refer to [[introduced species|introduced or naturalized species]], [[feral|feral species]], or introduced diseases. There are many species that are invasive. Some species, such as the [[Taraxacum officinale|dandelion]], while non-native, do not cause significant economic or ecologic damage and are not widely considered as invasive. Overall, it is estimated that 50,000 non-native species have been introduced to the United States, including livestock, crops, pets, and other non-invasive species. Economic damages associated with invasive species' effects and control costs are estimated at $120 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, Rodolfo Zuniga, Doug Morrison.

==Economic impacts of invasive species==

The [[economic impacts of invasive species]] can be difficult to estimate, especially when an invasive species does not affect economically important native species. This is due in part to the difficulty in determining the [[non-use value]] of native habitats damaged by invasive species, and in part to incomplete knowledge of the effects of all of the invasive species present in the U.S. Estimates for the damages caused by well-known species can vary as well. The [[Office of Technology Assessment]] (OTA) has estimated [[zebra mussel]] economic effects at $300,000 a year, while an [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|ACoE]] study put the number at $1 billion. The United States government spends an estimated $1 billion to recover from the invasive Formosan termite, investing $300 million of this budget is spent in areas surround New Orleans, a major port city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://is.cbr.tulane.edu/index.html|title=Louisiana Invasive Species|website=is.cbr.tulane.edu|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of total yearly costs due to invasive species range from $1.1 billion per year to $137 billion per year.&lt;ref name="nau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmrs.nau.edu/invasive_species/ |title=Invasive Species Research - Rocky Mountain Research Station - USDA Forest Service |publisher=Rmrs.nau.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the OTA estimated that a total of $100 million is invested annually in invasive species aquatic weed control in the US.&lt;ref&gt;OTA, 1993. Harmful Non-Indigenous Species in the United States. Office of Technology Assessment, United States Congress, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced rats cause more than $19 billion per year in damages,&lt;ref&gt;USDA, 2001. Agricultural Statistics. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; exotic fish cause up to $5.4 billion annually, and the total costs of introduced weeds are estimated at around $27 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;Pimentel, D., Lach, L., Zuniga, R., Morrison, D., 1999. Environmental and economic costs associated with introduced nonnative species in the United States. Manuscript, pp. 1– 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The total damage to the U.S. native bird population due to invasive species is approximately $17 billion per year. Approximately $2.1 billion in forest products are lost each year to invasive plant pathogens in the United States, and a conservative estimate of the losses to U.S. livestock from exotic microbes and parasites was $9 billion per year in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, Rodolfo Zuniga, Doug Morrison. Update on the environmental and economic costs associated with alien-invasive species in the United States. Ecological Economics. 52 (2005) 273-288&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policies and management efforts==
The federal government has historically promoted the introduction and widespread distribution of species that would become invasive, including [[multiflora rose]], [[kudzu]], and others for numerous reasons. Before the 20th century, numerous species were imported and released without government oversight, such as the [[gypsy moth]] and [[house sparrow]]. Over 50% of flora recognized as invasive or noxious weeds were deliberately introduced to the United States, by either government policy or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;The United States Naturalized Flora: Largely the Product of Deliberate Introductions Richard N. Mack and Marianne Erneberg. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden. Vol. 89, No. 2 (Spring, 2002), pp. 176-189&lt;/ref&gt; Current government policy can be broadly separated into two categories: preventing entry of a potential invasive species and controlling the spread of species already present. This is carried out by different government agencies, depending on what types of damage a species can cause. 
[[Image:RN Beetle galleries, Wych elm.JPG|thumb|right|[[Dutch elm disease]] was introduced accidentally through imported lumber in 1928]]

===Regulations designed to prevent entry of invasive species===

The [[Lacey Act of 1900]], originally designed to protect game wildlife, its role has increased to prohibit parties from bringing non-native species that have the potential to become invasive into the United States. The Lacey Act gives the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|FWS]] the power to list a species as "injurious" and regulate or prohibit its entry into the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;"Nation marks Lacey Act centennial, 100 years of federal wildlife law enforcement. US Fish and Wildlife Service. Retrieved on July 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alien Species Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1992]] makes it illegal to transport a plant or animal deemed injurious into the United States through the mail. The FWS concerns itself mostly with the invasive species likely to threaten sensitive habitats or [[endangered species]].

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] is also involved in preventing the introduction of invasive species, largely through the [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]], or APHIS. APHIS was originally tasked with preventing damage to agriculture and forestry from alien species, pests, or diseases, but has had its mission expanded to include preventing invasive species spread as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/about_aphis/ |title=Usda - Aphis - About Aphis |publisher=Aphis.usda.gov |date=2007-10-18 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes identifying potential pests and diseases, assisting in international and domestic eradication efforts, and the [[Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance| Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance Program]], designed initially to deal with illegally imported produce, but now tasked with preventing the entry of exotic pests, diseases, and potentially invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/international_safeguarding/sitc/index.shtml |title=USDA - APHIS - International Safeguarding - Services |publisher=Aphis.usda.gov |date=2011-06-28 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; APHIS also enforces bans against interstate transport of pests, diseases, and species listed as injurious, noxious weeds, or nuisance species. An example of the USDA banning imports is the ban on fresh [[mangosteen]] fruit due to concerns about fruit flies from southeast Asia. This ban originally allowed only frozen or canned fruit, but now allows for fresh irradiated fruit to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/dining/08mang.html | work=The New York Times | title=Mangosteens Arrive, but Be Prepared to Pay | first=David | last=Karp | date=8 August 2007 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reducing the spread of dangerous invasive species===

Many invasive species are spread inadvertently by human activities, such as seeds stuck to clothing or mud transporting firewood, or through ballast water. The government has instituted several different policies related to different pathways the invasive species may be spread. For example, quarantines on a federal and state level exist for firewood across the Eastern United States in an attempt to halt the spread of the [[emerald ash borer]], [[gypsy moth]], [[oak wilt]], and others. Transporting firewood out of quarantine zones can result in a fine of up to $1,000,000 and 25 years in jail, but punishments are usually much lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnr.wi.gov/invasives/firewood/ |title=Web Page Redirect - Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |publisher=Dnr.wi.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques available for controlling the spread of invasive species can be broadly defined into 6 categories:&lt;ref name="guidelines"&gt;"Guidelines for ranking invasive species control projects. Volume I." National Invasive Species Council. May, 2005. http://www.invasivespecies.gov/global/CMR/CMR_documents/NISC%20Control%20and%20Management%20Guidelines.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cultural practices
**[[Controlled burn]]s and timbering. An example of this in action is the use of prescribed burns in the [[Everglades]] to control ''[[Melaleuca quinquenervia]]'' trees. The burns destroy ''Melaleuca'', but not native species which have adapted to wildfires, which were common, but are now suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/invasives/staffTrainingModule/methods/burning/practice.html |title=In Practice - Prescribed Burning: Management Methods - Managing Invasive Plants |publisher=Fws.gov |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference with dispersal
**May include fencing, reducing accidental seed transport, and the construction of barriers, such as the electric barrier on the Chicago Sanitary &amp; Ship Canal, discussed below.
*Mechanical removal
**Includes mowing, harvesting, manual removal, trapping, &amp; culling. Many invasive plants, such as [[garlic mustard]], can regrow quickly after mowing and must be removed by the roots or chemically.
*Chemical control
**May include the use of any approved pesticide or herbicide, or vaccines to control invasive diseases. [[Sea lamprey]]s in the Great Lakes have had their numbers significantly reduced by a lampricide that kills larvae, which hatch in streams, before they can enter the lakes. The lampricide is responsible for reducing the sea lamprey population in the Great Lakes from over 3 million in the 1950s to around 450,000 today, and with potentially rescuing several Great Lakes fisheries.&lt;ref name="echo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greatlakesecho.org/2009/05/11/pheromones-in-river-traps-attract-sea-lampreys/ |title=Pheromones in river traps attract sea lampreys |publisher=Great Lakes Echo |date=2009-05-11 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Biological control
**Can involve the release of specific predators/herbivores, parasites, or diseases designed to control an invasive species without damaging native ones. One example of this is the city of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga's]] use of goats to control [[kudzu]] growing on mountain ridges. The goats, guarded from predators by llamas, eat the vine often enough to slowly starve the roots, killing the plant. This method is much cheaper than the repeated mowing or herbicidal spraying that would otherwise be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/us/05goats.html?ex=1338696000&amp;en=cfc0f304b4a68bfc&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | work=The New York Times | first=Theo | last=Emery | title=In Tennessee, Goats Eat the ‘Vine That Ate the South' | date=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goats reach areas which are inaccessible to machines and have multichambered stomachs which coupled with their grazing technique mean that goats leave few seeds behind to sprout again.&lt;ref name=bbc_13Jan2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jolly|first1=Joanna|title=The goats fighting America's plant invasion|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30583512|website=BBC Magazine|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interference with reproduction
**This can include the release of mating-disrupting pheromones or the release of sterile males. Field tests are underway to study the control of [[sea lamprey]]s in the Great Lakes by the use of pheromone-baited traps in streams, in addition to current chemical controls. When female sea lampreys return to the stream to breed, they are drawn to the traps and captured, preventing reproduction from occurring.&lt;ref name="echo"/&gt;

An integrated pest management (IPM) approach, as defined by the National Invasive Species Council, uses scientific data and population monitoring to help determine the most efficient control strategy, which is usually a combination of several of the methods listed above. Agencies are encouraged to use an [[adaptive management]] strategy, involving regular reviews on the efficiency of their policies and conduct research into better methods.&lt;ref name="guidelines"/&gt;

===Inter-department co-operation===
Invasive species control is not overseen by one government agency. Eight agencies (divisions) of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) work on invasive species issues that include, [[Agricultural Research Service]] (ARS), [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS), [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service]] (CSREES), [[Economic Research Service]] (ERS), [[Farm Service Agency]] (FSA), [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] (FAS), [[United States Forest Service]] (FS), and the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.invasivespeciesinfo.gov%2Fdocs%2Fresources%2Fusdanoharm20100217.doc USDA "Do No Harm" 2009 Report]- Retrieved 2017-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; Different invasive species are controlled by different agencies. For example, policies aimed at controlling the [[emerald ash borer]] are undertaken by the [[USDA]], because [[United States National Forest|National Forests]], the body coordinating emerald ash borer control efforts, are within the USDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopthebeetle.info/ |title=Emerald Ash Borer Beetle (EAB) &amp;#124; Stop The Beetle |publisher=Stopthebeetle.info |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.invasivespecies.gov/ National Invasive Species Council] was created by executive order in 1999 and charged with promoting efficiency and coordination between the numerous federal invasive species prevention and control policies. The NISC is co-chaired by the secretaries of the three federal departments that are charged with invasive species control: [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]], [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]], and [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce]].

Global Invasive Species Programme, Nairobi.&lt;/ref&gt; Many state efforts use a similar council model to coordinate agencies within a state.

==Education and outreach==
[[File:Zebra mussel warning sign.jpg|thumb|Warning signs like these are a first-line defense against the expansion of easily-spread invasive species, such as the [[zebra mussel]]]]
Many of the policies used to contain invasive species, such as firewood transport bans or cleaning shoes and clothes after hiking are effective only when the general public knows of their existence and importance. Because of this numerous programs to inform the public about invasive species. This includes placing signs at boat ramps, campsites, state borders, hiking trails, and numerous other locations as reminders of policies and potential fines associated with breaking policies. There are also numerous government programs aimed at educating children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/toolkit/outreach.shtml |title=Invasive Species: Manager's Tool Kit - Outreach Tools |publisher=Invasivespeciesinfo.gov |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting volunteer efforts at removal, and the many ways citizens can prevent the spread of invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/invasives/what-you-can-do.html |title=What Can You Do - Invasive Species - U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |publisher=Fws.gov |date=2012-01-19 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invasive species by area==

===Great Lakes===

Current efforts in the [[Great Lakes]] [[ecoregion]] focus on measures that prevent the introduction of invasive species. As a major transport area, a [[Great Lakes#Invasive species|number of invasive species]] have already been established within the Great Lakes. In 1998, the United States Coast Guard, in accordance with the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, established a set of voluntary ballast water management program. In 2004 this voluntary program became mandatory for every ship entering US controlled waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg522/cg5224/bwm.asp |title=Ballast Water Management |publisher=Uscg.mil |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current measures are among the most stringent in the world and require ships entering from outside the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] to flush ballast water in open seas or retain their ballast water for the length of their stay in the Great Lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatlakes-seaway.com/en/environment/ballast-water/index.html |title=Seaway System - The Environment - Ballast Water |publisher=Greatlakes-seaway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.si.edu/labs/marine_invasions/vector_ecology/bw_exchange.aspx |title=SERC - Marine Invasions: Mid-ocean Ballast Water Exchange |publisher=Serc.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to comply with the US Coast Guards regulations can result in a class C felony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg522/cg5224/ans.asp |title=Aquatic Nuisance Species |publisher=Uscg.mil |date=2011-01-04 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another preventative measure in the Great Lakes region is the presence of an electrified barrier in the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]]. The barrier is meant to keep [[Asian carp]] from reaching Lake Michigan and the other Great Lakes. On December 2, 2010, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were denied their request to force the closing the Canal by Judge Robert Dow of the United States District Court for Northern District of Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatlakeslaw.org/blog/2010/12/another-setback-in-the-legal-fight-to-keep-asian-carp-out-of-the-great-lakes.html |title=Another setback in the legal fight to keep Asian carp out of the Great Lakes |publisher=Great Lakes Law |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatlakeslaw.org/files/dist_ct_pi_opinion_order.pdf |title=Case: 1:10-cv-04457 Document #: 155 Filed: 12/02/10 Page 1 of 61 PageID #:4980 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closing of the Canal would have once again permanently separated Lake Michigan and the Mississippi river system. States argued that the canal, and the Asian carp in it, posed a risk to $7 billion worth of industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Egan |first=Dan |url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/80731962.html |title=Illinois fights back over carp lawsuit |publisher=JSOnline |date=2010-01-05 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the electric barrier is the only preventative measure and some question its effectiveness, particularly following the discovery of Asian carp DNA past the barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_17798637?nclick_check=1 |title=Chicago waterway gets third electric barrier aimed at keeping Asian carp out of Great Lakes |publisher=TwinCities.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of DNA of Asian carp could be linked to live bait used around the Great Lakes region. The method for identifying the DNA is called environmental DNA (eDNA) surveillance. This method uses DNA, that is left in the environment, to identify species in low abundances.

The [[USDA]] Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) has a specific Invasive Species Working Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmrs.nau.edu/invasive_species/iswg.php |title=Invasive Species Working Group - Rocky Mountain Research Station - USDA Forest Service |publisher=Rmrs.nau.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to do the research about invasive species in Rocky Mountain region. The Invasive Species Working Group focuses on four key areas: (1) prediction and prevention, (2) early detection and rapid response, (3) control and management, and (4) restoration and rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="nau"/&gt; Specific approaches include prioritizing of invasive species problems, increased collaboration among agencies regarding those problems, and accountability for the responsible use of the limited resources available for invasive control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/fhp/invasive_plants/strategic/framework.pdf |title=A Framework for the Development of the National Invasive Species Management Strategy for the USDA Forest Service |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invasive species of particular concern in the Rocky Mountain region include: [[cheatgrass]]; [[Euphorbia virgata|leafy spurge]]; [[tansy ragwort]]; [[spotted knapweed]]; bufflegrass; [[saltcedar]]; [[white pine blister rust]]; [[armillaria root rot]]; introduced trout species; golden algae; spruce aphid; and banded elm bark beetle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2009_butler_j001.pdf |title=Research Summary and Expertise Directory |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorado River===

Already stressed by water management and damming, the Colorado River of Western United States is losing its big-river fish community to combined effects of predation and competition by introduced non-native fishes. This fish community includes four large fishes that are listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. One of these, the Colorado pikeminnow (AKA white or Colorado river salmon, Ptychocheilus lucius) is the largest minnow native to North America, and it is well known for its spectacular fresh water spawning migrations and homing ability. Despite a massive recovery effort, its numbers decline. Hampered by a loss of about 80% of its habitat, the young of this once abundant fish is overwhelmed in its nursery habitat by invasive small fishes (such as red shiner and fathead minnow), whose numbers are as high as 90% of the standing stocks. Its juveniles and adults now must also compete with and are preyed upon by introduced northern pike, channel and flathead catfishes, large and smallmouth basses, common carp, and other fishes.&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Tyus and J.F. Saunders 2000. Nonnative fish control and endangered fish recovery: Lessons from the Colorado River. Fisheries 25(9):17-24)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the listing of these non native sport fish as invasive is controversial, as the fish are popular among anglers, who criticize the science used by government agencies and assert that nonnative species are largely a scapegoat in the decline of endemic Colorado River basin fish, blaming changes to the environment in the forms of dams and water diversions as being the main cause &lt;ref&gt;https://www.denverpost.com/2007/12/01/pike-at-heart-of-rifle-gap-discussion/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invasive species by state===

====Arizona====
{{See also|List of invasive plant species in Arizona}}

====California====
{{Main|List of invasive plant species in California|List of invasive species in California}}
California has created a policy system towards invasive species, including Invasive Species Council of California (ISCC), California Invasive Species Advisory Committee (CISAC) and California Invasive Plant Council (Cal-IPC), a non-profit organization. The ISCC represents the highest level of leadership and authority in state government regarding invasive species. The ISCC is an inter-agency council that helps to coordinate and ensure complementary, cost-efficient, environmentally sound and effective state activities regarding invasive species. CISAC advises the ISCC, and created the [http://ice.ucdavis.edu/invasives/home/species  California list of invasive species]  California has many diverse [[Ecology of California|ecoregions]], and numerous endemic species that are at risk from invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscc.ca.gov/ |title=Welcome to the Invasive Species Council of California |publisher=Iscc.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florida====

=====Florida Everglades=====

{{See also|List of invasive species in the Everglades}}
Invasive species in Florida currently make up more than 26% of the animal population and a full one third of the flora population.&lt;ref&gt;Ferriter, ''et al'' (2001) http://mytest.sfwmd.gov/portal/page/portal/pg_grp_sfwmd_sfer/portlet_prevreport/consolidated_01/chapter%2014/ch14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994, the [[Everglades Forever Act|Everglades Forever Act of 1994]] was passed to help in controlling Florida's water supply, recreation areas, and diverse flora and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Statutes Chapter 373.4592, {{cite web |url=http://exchange.law.miami.edu/everglades/statutes/state/florida/E_forever.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028150828/http://exchange.law.miami.edu/everglades/statutes/state/florida/E_forever.htm |archivedate=2008-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to control and prevention measures the act also calls for efforts to monitor the distribution of known invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;Ferriter, "et al" (2001) http://mytest.sfwmd.gov/portal/page/portal/pg_grp_sfwmd_sfer/portlet_prevreport/consolidated_01/chapter%2014/ch14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One invasive species occurring in the Everglades that can have serious consequences is the [[Burmese python]]. Between 2000 and 2010, approximately 1,300 of the snakes were removed from the Everglades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/01/23/2012-1155/injurious-wildlife-species-listing-three-python-species-and-one-anaconda-species-as-injurious|title=Injurious Wildlife Species; Listing Three Python Species and One Anaconda Species as Injurious Reptiles|date=23 January 2012|publisher=Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the [[National Park Service]]  is researching control measures for the Burmese python in order to limit the species effects on the delicate Everglades ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/ever/naturescience/upload/PythonFactSheetLoRes.pdf |title=Natural Resources Management - Burmese Pythons |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the presence of the invasive land planarian ''[[Platydemus manokwari]]'' was recorded from several gardens in [[Miami]]. ''Platydemus manokwari'' is  a predator of land snails and is considered a danger to endemic snails wherever it has been introduced.&lt;ref name="JustineWinsor2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Justine|first1=Jean-Lou|last2=Winsor|first2=Leigh|last3=Barrière|first3=Patrick|last4=Fanai|first4=Crispus|last5=Gey|first5=Delphine|last6=Han|first6=Andrew Wee Kien|last7=La Quay-Velázquez|first7=Giomara|last8=Lee|first8=Benjamin Paul Yi-Hann|last9=Lefevre|first9=Jean-Marc|last10=Meyer|first10=Jean-Yves|last11=Philippart|first11=David|last12=Robinson|first12=David G.|last13=Thévenot|first13=Jessica|last14=Tsatsia|first14=Francis|title=The invasive land planarianPlatydemus manokwari(Platyhelminthes, Geoplanidae): records from six new localities, including the first in the USA|journal=PeerJ|volume=3|year=2015|pages=e1037|issn=2167-8359|doi=10.7717/peerj.1037|url=https://peerj.com/articles/1037/|pmid=26131377|pmc=4485254}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawaii====

{{Main|Invasive species in Hawaii}}
In Hawaii measures to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species are coordinated by the Hawaii Invasive Species Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiinvasivespecies.org/hisc/ |title=Hawaii Invasive Species Council (HISC) |publisher=Hawaiiinvasivespecies.org |date=2003-10-29 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the council is broken into five committees which focus on different areas of invasive species control. These focus areas are (1) prevention (2) management of established pests (3) increased public awareness (4) research and technology and (5) monetary resources.

Currently, Hawaii requires inspection of any and all plant, animal and microorganism transports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/hdoa/pi/pq |title=Plant Quarantine — Hawaii Department of Agriculture |publisher=Hawaii.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes transports from the mainland in addition to transports occurring between islands. Travelers are required to fill out a [http://hawaii.gov/hdoa/pi/pq/Exhibit_3.pdf declaration form] for each journey. Failure to declare these transports can result in up to one year imprisonment or a $250,000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/hdoa/pi/pq/Exhibit_3.pdf |title=Exhibit 3. State of Hawaii Department of Agriculture Plants and Animals Declaration Form |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many potential invasives or carriers for invasives require permits and quarantine periods before entry to the state is allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaiiplants.com/importfaq.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions on Import and Export Regulations of Plant Species |publisher=Hawaiiplants.com |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are other preventative measures such as a hotline for reporting sightings of known potential invaders like the [[Brown tree snake#Invasive species|brown tree snake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/hdoa/pi/pq/bts |title=Brown Tree Snake Program — Hawaii Department of Agriculture |publisher=Hawaii.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Idaho====

The Idaho Department of Agriculture (U.S.) has around 300 introduced or exotic species listed with 36 classified as [[noxious weed]]s (invasive{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} species). The legal designation of noxious weed for a plant species can use these four criteria:&lt;ref name="Prather"&gt;{{cite book| last = Prather | first = Timothy | title = Idaho's Noxious Weeds | publisher = University of Idaho | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#It is present in but not native to state-province-ecosystem.
#It is potentially more harmful than beneficial to that area.
#Its management, control, or eradication is economically and physically feasible.
#The potential adverse impact of it exceeds the cost of its control.

Some of the plants on Idaho's noxious weed list that are harmful or poisonous are:
*[[Leafy spurge]]: native to [[Eurasia]]. It has a milky latex in all its parts that can produce [[blisters]] and [[dermatitis]] in humans, cattle, and horses and may cause permanent blindness if rubbed into an eye.
*[[Poison hemlock]]: native to Europe. It contains highly poisonous [[alkaloids]] toxic to all classes of domesticated grazing animals. ''[[Agonopterix alstroemeriana]]'' is used as a biological control method for the plant, which in high larval numbers can kill large areas of the poisonous plant.
*[[Russian knapweed]]: native to the Caucasus in southern Russia and Asia. It causes [[chewing disease]] in horses.
*Tansy ragwort: native to Eurasia. All parts are poisonous, it causes liver damage to cattle and horses, while it affects sheep to a lesser extent.
*[[Toothed spurge]]: native to the [[Great Plains]] region. A milky latex exists in all parts of the plant that can produce blisters and dermatitis in humans, cattle, and horses. It may cause permanent blindness if rubbed into the eye.
*[[Yellow starthistle]]: native to the [[Mediterranean basin]] area and Asia. It causes death and chewing disease in horses.
*[[Yellow toadflax]]: native to Europe. It contains a poisonous [[glucoside]] that may be harmful to livestock.
'''Louisiana'''

The city of New Orleans, the "gateway to the Mississippi", is a porous port city with rich soils. In turn, many aquatic plants are introduced to the region, making Louisiana the state with the second largest list of invasive aquatic species,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/|title=Nonindigenous Aquatic Species|website=nas.er.usgs.gov|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; second to Florida.

Invasive species pose a threat to wildlife, habitat, waterways, economy, and the health of humans in New York State. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ([[NYSDEC]]) works with stewards of natural resources, non-profits and citizen scientists to detect, record and manage invasive species. These collaborations are organized into 8 Partnerships for Regional Invasive Species Management (PRISMs) throughout NYS. THE PRISMS were formed under Title 17, Environmental Conservation Law 9-1705(5)(g). 

According to NYSDEC &lt;ref&gt;NYSDEC PRISM Fact Sheet, http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/lands_forests_pdf/prismfactsheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; PRISMS perform the following tasks: plan regional invasive species management;develop early detection and rapid response capacity;implement eradication projects; educate the public in cooperation with DEC contracted Education and Outreach providers; coordinate PRISM partners; recruit and train volunteers; support research through citizen science.

The '''Lee–Boot effect''' is a phenomenon concerning the suppression or prolongation of [[oestrous cycles]] of mature female mice (and other rodents), when females are housed in groups and isolated from males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|title=Spontaneous Pseudopregnancy in Mice|last1=Lee|first1=S. van der|last2=Boot|first2= L.M|journal=Acta Physiol. Pharmacol.|publisher=Neer.|volume=5|issue=213|date=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.uci.edu/tmf/husbandry.htm|title=Mouse Husbandry, Breeding and Development: Pheromone Effects|publisher=Transgenic Mouse Facility, University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by the effects of an oestrogen-dependent [[pheromone]], released via the urine, that acts on the [[vomeronasal organ]] of recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Neil R.|title=Physiology of behavior|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston|isbn=0205239390|page=335|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pheromone lowers the concentration of [[luteinizing hormone]] and elevates [[prolactin]] levels, synchronising or stopping the recipient’s cycle. This effect goes some way to explain why spontaneous [[pseudopregnancy]] can occur in mice. The same response is invoked from isolated females when brought into contact with urine-soaked bedding from other females’ cages. Removing the vomeronasal organ of recipients causes an ineffective response – indicating that the cues are not mediated by the vomeronasal system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19615">[[Image:lensspeed.jpg|frame|right|A fast prime (fixed focal length) lens, the Canon 50mm {{f/}}1.4 (left), and a slower zoom lens, the Canon 18–55mm {{f/}}3.5–5.6 (right); this lens is faster at 18mm than it is at 55mm.]]
'''Lens speed''' refers to the maximum [[aperture]] diameter, or minimum [[f-number]], of a [[photographic lens]]. A lens with a larger maximum aperture (that is, a smaller minimum f-number) is called a "fast lens" because it can achieve the same exposure with a faster [[shutter speed]]. Conversely, a smaller maximum aperture (larger minimum f-number) is "slow" because it delivers less light intensity and requires a slower (longer) shutter speed.

A fast lens speed is desirable in taking pictures in dim light, or with long [[telephoto]] lenses and for controlling [[depth of field]] and [[bokeh]], especially in portrait photography,&lt;ref&gt;Waldren, Margaret (and others) ''Advanced Digital Photography'' 2004 Media Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;  and for [[sports photography]] and [[photojournalism]].

Lenses may also be referred to as being "faster" or "slower" than one another; so an {{f/|3.5|link=yes}} lens can be described as faster than an {{f/}}5.6.

==Tradeoffs==
Attaining maximum lens speed requires engineering tradeoffs, and as such, "[[prime lens|prime]]" (fixed focal length) lenses are generally faster than [[zoom lens]]es, and modern manual-focus lenses are generally faster than their autofocus counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Ben ''Complete Digital Photography'' 2004 Charles River Media&lt;/ref&gt;

With 35mm cameras, the fastest lenses are typically in the "[[normal lens]]" range near 50mm and there are several high-quality fast lenses available that are relatively inexpensive. For example, the [[Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II|Canon EF 50mm {{f/}}1.8 II]] or [[Nikon AF Nikkor 50 mm f/1.8D|Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm {{f/}}1.8D]] are very inexpensive, but quite fast and optically well-regarded. Old fast manual focus lenses, just as the Nikkor-S(C) or Nikkor AI-S 50mm {{f/}}1.4, were historically produced abundantly, and are thus sold relatively inexpensively on the used lens market.

Especially outside of the "normal lenses", lens speed also tends to correlate with the price and/or quality of the lens. This is because lenses with larger maximum apertures require greater care with regard to design, precision of manufacture, special coatings and quality of glass. At wide apertures, [[spherical aberration]] becomes more significant and must be corrected. Faster [[telephoto]] and wide-angle [[retrofocus]] designs tend to be much more expensive.

==Fast lenses==
The fastest lenses in general production now are {{f/}}1.2 or {{f/}}1.4, with more at {{f/}}1.8 and {{f/}}2.0, and many at {{f/}}2.8 or slower. What is considered "fast" has evolved to lower f-numbers over the years, due to advances in [[lens design]], [[optical manufacturing]], quality of glass, [[optical coating]]s, and the move toward smaller imaging formats. For example, the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] states that "...[Lenses] are also sometimes classified according to their rapidity, as expressed by their effective apertures, into extra rapid, with apertures larger than {{f/}}6; rapid, with apertures from {{f/}}6 to {{f/}}8; slow, with apertures less than {{f/}}11."

[[Image:Canon 85mm comparison (front).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Canon EF 85mm lens|Canon 85mm {{f/}}1.8 and {{f/}}1.2]] showing their large [[entrance pupil]]s]]
For scale, note that {{f/}}0.5, {{f/}}0.7, {{f/}}1.0, {{f/}}1.4, and {{f/}}2.0 are each 1 f-stop apart (2× as fast), as an f-stop corresponds to a factor of [[square root of 2]], about 1.4. Thus around {{f/}}1.0, a change of 0.1 corresponds to about 1/4 of an f-stop (by [[linear approximation]]): {{f/}}1.0 is about 50% faster than {{f/}}1.2, which is about 50% faster than {{f/}}1.4.

{{as of|2017}}, Canon, Nikon, Pentax and Sony all make an autofocus 50mm {{f/}}1.4 lens.  These are not unusual lenses and are relatively inexpensive. Canon also makes autofocus 50mm and 85mm {{f/}}1.2 lenses, while Nikon makes a manual focus 50mm {{f/}}1.2 lens and an autofocus 85mm {{f/}}1.4; see [[Canon EF 50mm lens]]es and [[Canon EF 85mm lens]]es for details.  Pentax makes a 50mm {{f/}}1.4 lens and 55mm {{f/}}1.4 lens for [[APS-C]] cameras; see [[Pentax lenses]]. Sony makes a 50mm {{f/}}1.4 lens which is a continuation of the [[Minolta AF 50mm f/1.4 lens|Minolta AF 50mm {{f/}}1.4 lens]], and two lenses with Carl Zeiss: a 50mm {{f/}}1.4 and 85mm {{f/}}1.4.

The maximum [[exposure time]] in free-hand photography can be enhanced even more also for fast lenses, if the camera is equipped with an [[image stabilisation]] system. In 2014 [[Panasonic]] introduced the fastest lens with in-built stabilisation, the [[Leica Camera|Leica]] [[Nocticron]] 42.5&amp;nbsp;mm f/1.2, which in the meantime even can be operated with dual image stabilisation (Dual I.S.), provided that the camera body has an additional [[Image stabilization#Sensor-shift|stabilising system at the image sensor]], too.

In the mid 60s there was something of a fad for fast lenses among the major manufacturers.&lt;ref name=Maiello2000 /&gt; In 1966 in response to the trend [[Carl Zeiss]] displayed a prop lens christened the Super-Q-Gigantar 40mm {{f/}}0.33 at [[photokina 1966|photokina]].&lt;ref name=Maiello2000 /&gt; Made from various parts found around the factory (the lenses came from a [[Enlarger#Types of Enlarger|darkroom condenser enlarger]]), the claimed speed and focal lengths were purely nominal and it wasn't usable for photography.&lt;ref  name=Maiello2000&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nadir.it/pandora/ZEISS.htm |title=L'OBIETTIVO PIU' LUMINOSO DEL MONDO |last1=Maiello |first1=Agostino |date=January 2000 |website=Nadir.it |publisher=Nadir Magazine |accessdate=28 September 2013|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhang2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://petapixel.com/2013/08/06/carl-zeiss-super-q-gigantar-40mm-f0-33-the-fastest-lens-ever-made/ |title=Carl Zeiss Super-Q-Gigantar 40mm {{f/}}0.33: The Fastest Lens Ever Made? |last1=Zhang |first1=Michael |date=August 6, 2013 |website=Petapixel |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maximum possible speed ===
Ultimately, the speed of a lens is limited by mechanical constraints of the camera system (shutter or mirror clearance, [[lens mount|mount]] diameter). The smallest possible [[working f-number]] is

:&lt;math&gt;N_\text{min} = \frac{1}{2\;\mathrm{NA}_\text{max}} = \frac{1}{2\,n \sin\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* NA&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the largest possible [[numerical aperture]],
* {{var|n}} is the [[index of refraction]] of the medium behind the lens, most often air where {{var|n}} = 1,
* {{var|θ}} is the half-angle of the maximum cone of light that can reach the film or sensor.

This sets a limit close to {{f/}}1.0 to {{f/}}1.2 for most [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] mounts, whereas lenses for [[Rangefinder camera|rangefinder]] and [[Mirrorless camera|mirrorless]] cameras can be faster, as they can be brought closer to the image plane. Reproduction lenses incapable of infinity focus can have nominal f-numbers smaller than this limit, as the limit applies to the ''working'' f-number (the f-number corrected by the [[Bellows (photography)|bellows factor]]), not to the nominal f-number. It should be noted that only the working f-number correctly assesses the light gathering power of the lens.

Since {{math|sin θ &lt; 1}}, it follows that no lens can be faster than {{f/}}0.5 if it operates in air. Lenses can be made faster than this by requiring the film emulsion to be in physical contact with the rear element, thus eliminating the air gap between the lens and the emulsion. Another option is to use [[oil immersion]] techniques.

In the [[ISO/IEC 80000|International System of Quantities]], the '''level''' of a quantity is the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same quantity.&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO 80000-3|ISO 80000-3:2006, ''Quantities and units'', Part 2: Space and Time]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Carey, Sound Sources and Levels in the Ocean, IEEE J Oceanic Eng 31:61–75(2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the various types of [[Sound level (disambiguation)|sound level]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;: [[sound power level]] (literally, the level of the [[sound power]], abbreviated SWL), [[sound exposure level]] (SEL), [[sound pressure level]] (SPL) and [[particle velocity level]] (SVL).&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO 80000-8|ISO 80000-8:2007, ''Quantities and units'', Part 8: Acoustics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Level and its units are defined in [[ISO 80000-3#Logarithmic quantities and units|ISO 80000-3]].

===Level===
Level of a quantity ''Q'', denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined by&lt;ref&gt;ANSI S1.1-2013 Acoustical Terminology, entry 3.01&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_Q = \log_r\!\left(\frac{Q}{Q_0}\right)\!,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''r'' is the base of the logarithm;
*''Q'' is the quantity;
*''Q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the reference value of ''Q''.

===Level of a root-power quantity{{anchor|Root-power quantities|Field quantities}}===
The level of a ''root-power'' quantity (also known as a ''field'' quantity), denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined by &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francesco_Damore3/publication/316104462_Effect_of_moisturizer_and_lubricant_on_the_finger-surface_sliding_contact_tribological_and_dynamical_analysis/links/58f9e4f2a6fdcc73cf270e91/Effect-of-moisturizer-and-lubricant-on-the-finger-surface-sliding-contact-tribological-and-dynamical-analysis.pdf e Industriale, F. D. I. C., &amp; D'Amore, F. Effect of moisturizer and lubricant on the finger‒surface sliding contact: tribological and dynamical analysis.]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_F = \log_{\mathrm{e}}\!\left(\frac{F}{F_0}\right)\!,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''F'' is the root-power quantity, proportional to the square root of power quantity;
*''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the reference value of ''F''.
For the level of a root-power quantity, the base of the logarithm is {{nowrap|1=''r'' = [[e (mathematical constant)|e]]}}.

===Level of a power quantity{{anchor|Power quantities}}===
Level of a ''power'' quantity, denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;, is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;L_P = \log_{\mathrm{e}^2}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''P'' is the power quantity;
*''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the reference value of ''P''.
For the level of a power quantity, the base of the logarithm is {{nowrap|1=''r'' = e&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;Ainslie, M. A. A Century of Sonar: Planetary Oceanography, Underwater Noise Monitoring, and the Terminology of Underwater Sound. [http://acousticstoday.org/a-century-of-sonar-planetary-oceanography-underwater-noise-monitoring-and-the-terminology-of-underwater-sound-michael-a-ainslie/ Acoustics Today], 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units of level==

===Power level ===
{{see also|Decibel#Conversions|Neper#Units}}

The [[neper]], [[Decibel|bel]], and [[decibel]] (one tenth of a bel) are units of level that are often applied to such quantities as power, intensity, or gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Barry Taylor | year=1995 | title=Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI): The Metric System | publisher=Diane Publishing Co. | page=28 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3HRRrDd1n8C&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The neper, bel, and decibel are defined by
*{{nowrap|1=Np = 1}};
*{{nowrap|1=B = {{sfrac|1|2}} log&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;10 Np}};
*{{nowrap|1=dB = 0.1 B = {{sfrac|1|20}} log&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;10 Np}}.

If ''F'' is a root-power quantity:
:&lt;math&gt;L_F = \log_{\mathrm{e}}\!\left(\frac{F}{F_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{Np} = 2 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{F}{F_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{B} = 20 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{F}{F_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''P'' is a power quantity:
:&lt;math&gt;L_P = \frac{1}{2} \log_{\mathrm{e}}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{Np} = \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{B} = 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the power quantity ''P'' is proportional to ''F''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and if the reference value of the power quantity, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is in the same proportion to ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the levels ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; are equal.

===Frequency level===
The [[Octave (electronics)|octave]] is a unit of level (specifically "frequency level",&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, H. (1934). Loudness, pitch and the timbre of musical tones and their relation to the intensity, the frequency and the overtone structure. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 6(2), 59–69.&lt;/ref&gt; for {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 2}}) though that concept is seldom seen outside of the ANSI standard that defines it.&lt;ref&gt;[[ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013|ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013, ''Acoustical Terminology'']]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[semitone]] is one twelfth of an octave. A [[Cent (music)|cent]] is one hundredth of a semitone.

'''Low information rationality''' is a [[social theory]] that states that people are [[information]] consumers with limited benefits and time for processing and understanding information. Due to the limited benefits and time individuals have for learning new information, individuals use various shortcuts and [[heuristics]] to understand information quicker. Simply put, it does not make sense for the average individual to develop in depth understandings of most issues. The theory is often used to explain the limited understanding of [[politics]] and [[Science|scientific]] [[Technology|technologies]] by the general [[public]].

==Assumptions==
The concept of low-information rationality is based on the assumption that [[human being]]s are [[cognitive miser]]s and minimize the economic costs of making decisions and forming attitudes. Most citizens will therefore not bother to develop an in-depth understanding of political or scientific issues, which would require significant time and effort. Rather, they collect only as much information as they think is necessary to make any given decision.&lt;ref name="Messages and Heuristics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@msh_publishing_group/documents/web_document/wtx032691.pdf|title=3 MESSAGES AND HEURISTICS: HOW AUDIENCES FORM ATTITUDES ABOUT EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES|last=Scheufele|first=Dietram|work=Engaging Science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key mechanisms==
The reason this theory comes about in today's age is due to vast increase in amount of information that each of us is exposed to through the [[internet]], [[Smartphone|smart phones]], and [[Television|TV]]. Therefore, these patterns of [[information processing]] make perfect sense for citizens who have to deal with thousands of pieces of new information every day, and we all use them. We spend less [[Cognition|cognitive]] effort in buying toothpaste than we do when picking a new car. And that difference in [[Information seeking|information-seeking]] is largely a function of the costs.&lt;ref name="Messages and Heuristics" /&gt;

==Shortcuts==
There are a variety of shortcuts individuals use to process information quickly and more efficiently. This does not mean, however, that these methods always lead to accurate and reliable conclusions. Common shortcuts include, [[stereotypes]], opinions of others, interpersonal influences, [[Framing (social sciences)|news frames]], [[heuristic]]s and [[political ideology]].

==Samuel Popkin: ''The Reasoning Voter''==
American pollster and political scientist [[Samuel L. Popkin|Samuel Popkin]] coined the term "low-information" in 1991 when he used the phrase "low-information signaling" in his book ''The Reasoning Voter: Communication and Persuasion in Presidential Campaigns.''&lt;ref name="popkin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Popkin|first=Samuel|title=The Reasoning Voter|year=1991|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=0226675440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAT-IREgyQ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popkin relies on a theory of low information rationality to explain how voters are able to make rational choices between candidates. Voters do this by using information shortcuts that they receive during campaigns, usually using something like a "drunkard's search." Voters use small amounts of personal information to construct a narrative about candidates. Essentially, they ask themselves this: "Based on what I know about the candidate personally, what is the probability that this presidential candidate was a good governor? What is the probability that he will be a good president?" Popkin's analysis is based on one main premise: voters use low information rationality gained in their daily lives, through the media and through personal interactions, to evaluate candidates and facilitate electoral choices.

==Other models==
The science Literacy/[[knowledge deficit]] model states that the public is willing and able to process information if it is available. Therefore, a lack of public support or participation is caused by a lack of information available to the public.

==Problems for science==
As mentioned above, scientists who use the knowledge deficit model face great difficulty conveying information to the lay public when overwhelming amount of psychology and political science studies show that the public uses the low information rationality model. Some examples of this are in the cutting-edge sciences of [[nanotechnology]] and biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brossard, D. |author2=Shanahan, J. |author3=Nesbitt, T.C. |title=The Public, the Media, and Biotechnology|year=2007|publisher=CABI|location=UK|isbn=978 1 84593 204 6|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For issues such as [[agricultural biotechnology]], for example, where developing an in-depth understanding would require significant efforts on the part of ordinary citizens, the pay-offs in terms of being able to make informed policy judgments may simply not be enough. As a result, it makes perfect sense for citizens to rely on shortcuts such as  opinions of others when forming their own opinions and trying to make sense of different policy positions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1495">'''Mariano de la Paz Graëlls y de la Aguera''' (1809 – 1898) was a Spanish [[entomologist]] notable for pioneering work on the [[forensic entomology|insects of corpses]].

Graëlls was born in [[Tricio]], in the [[La Rioja (autonomous community)|Province of Logroño]]. He died in [[Madrid]] where he had been Professor of [[Zoology]].

[[Image:Sphaeroderma rubidum01.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Sphaeroderma rubidum]]'' was described by Graells in 1858 (Image ©Entomart.ins)]]

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mental model''' is an explanation of someone's [[thought]] process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape [[behaviour]] and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal [[algorithm]]) and doing tasks.

A mental model is a kind of internal symbol or representation of external reality, hypothesized to play a major role in [[cognition]], [[reasoning]] and [[decision-making]]. [[Kenneth Craik]] suggested in 1943 that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality that it uses to anticipate events.

[[Jay Wright Forrester]] defined general mental models as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In psychology, the term ''mental models'' is sometimes used to refer to [[mental representation]]s or mental simulation generally. At other times it is used to refer to {{§l||Mental models and reasoning}} and to the mental model theory of reasoning developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]].

==History==
The term ''mental model'' is believed to have originated with [[Kenneth Craik]] in his 1943 book ''The Nature of Explanation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J.|authorlink=Nancy_J._Nersessian|title=In the Theoretician's Laboratory: Thought Experimenting as Mental Modeling|journal=PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|date=1992|volume=1992|pages=291–301|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/aimosaic/faculty/nersessian/papers/in-the-theoreticians-laboratory.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014|quote=The contemporary notion that mental modelling plays a significant role in human reasoning was formulated, initially, by Kenneth Craik in 1943.|doi=10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.2.192843}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staggers|first1=Nancy|last2=Norcio|first2=A.F.|title=Mental models: concepts for human-computer interaction research|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|date=1993|volume=38|issue=4|pages=587–605|doi=10.1006/imms.1993.1028|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~norcio/papers/1993/Staggers-MM-IJMMS.pdf|quote=Although Johnson-Laird (1989) is generally credited with coining the term mental model, the history of the concept may be traced to Craik's (1943) work entitled ''The Nature of Explanation''.|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Georges-Henri Luquet|Georges-Henri Luquet]] in ''Le dessin enfantin'' (Children's drawings), published in 1927 by Alcan, Paris, argued that children construct internal models, a view that influenced, among others, child psychologist [[Jean Piaget]].

[[Philip Johnson-Laird]] published ''Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference and Consciousness'' in 1983. In the same year, [[Dedre Gentner]] and [[Albert Stevens]] edited a collection of chapters in a book also titled ''Mental Models''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm "Mental models"], report at www.lauradove.info.&lt;/ref&gt; The first line of their book explains the idea further: "One function of this chapter is to belabor the obvious; people's views of the world, of themselves, of their own capabilities, and of the tasks that they are asked to perform, or topics they are asked to learn, depend heavily on the conceptualizations that they bring to the task." (see the book: ''[[Mental Models (Gentner-Stevens book)|Mental Models]]'').

Since then, there has been much discussion and use of the idea in [[human-computer interaction]] and [[usability]] by researchers including [[Donald Norman]] and Steve Krug (in his book ''[[Don't Make Me Think]]''). [[Walter Kintsch]] and [[Teun A. van Dijk]], using the term ''situation model'' (in their book ''Strategies of Discourse Comprehension'', 1983), showed the relevance of mental models for the production and comprehension of [[discourse]].

==Mental models and reasoning==&lt;!-- [[#Mental models and reasoning]] above links to this heading --&gt;
One view of human reasoning is that it depends on mental models. In this view, mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the [[picture theory of language]] described by philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1922. [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] developed a theory of mental models which makes the assumption that reasoning depends, not on logical form, but on mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

===Principles of mental models===
Mental models are based on a small set of fundamental assumptions ([[axiom]]s), which distinguish them from other proposed representations in the [[psychology of reasoning]] (Byrne and Johnson-Laird, 2009). Each mental model represents a possibility. A mental model represents one possibility, capturing what is common to all the different ways in which the possibility may occur (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). Mental models are iconic, i.e., each part of a model corresponds to each part of what it represents (Johnson-Laird, 2006). Mental models are based on a principle of truth: they typically represent only those situations that are possible, and each model of a possibility represents only what is true in that possibility according to the proposition. However, mental models can represent what is false, temporarily assumed to be true, for example, in the case of [[counterfactual conditionals]] and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

===Reasoning with mental models===
People infer that a conclusion is valid if it holds in all the possibilities. Procedures for reasoning with mental models rely on counter-examples to refute invalid inferences; they establish validity by ensuring that a conclusion holds over all the models of the premises. Reasoners focus on a subset of the possible models of multiple-model problems, often just a single model. The ease with which reasoners can make deductions is affected by many factors, including age and working memory (Barrouillet, et al., 2000). They reject a conclusion if they find a counterexample, i.e., a possibility in which the premises hold, but the conclusion does not (Schroyens, et al. 2003; Verschueren, et al., 2005).

===Criticisms===
Scientific debate continues about whether human reasoning is based on mental models, versus formal [[rules of inference]] (e.g., O'Brien, 2009), domain-specific rules of inference (e.g., Cheng &amp; Holyoak, 2008; Cosmides, 2005), or probabilities (e.g., Oaksford and Chater, 2007). Many empirical comparisons of the different theories have been carried out (e.g., Oberauer, 2006).

==Mental models of dynamics systems: mental models in system dynamics==

===Characteristics===
A mental model is generally:
* founded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts
* '''[[Cognitive flexibility|flexible]]''' – is considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense
* an '''information filter''' – causes [[selective perception]], perception of only selected parts of [[information]]
* '''very limited''', compared with the complexities of the world, and even when a [[scientific modelling|scientific model]] is extensive and in accordance with a certain [[reality]] in the derivation of [[logical consequence]]s of it, it must take into account such restrictions as [[working memory]]; i.e., rules on the maximum number of elements that people are able to remember, [[gestaltism]]s or failure of the principles of [[logic]], etc.
* dependent on sources of information, which one can not find anywhere else, are available at any time and can be used.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proverbs.cz/media/art/SM_ST.pdf |format=PDF |author=Šusta, Marek |title=Několik slov o systémové dynamice a systémovém myšlení |pages=3–9 |publisher=Proverbs, a.s. |language=Czech |accessdate= 2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mild2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mildeova, S., Vojtko V. |title=Systémová dynamika |year=2003 |isbn=80-245-0626-2 |publisher=Oeconomica |location=Prague |pages=19–24 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forste1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/ford_sterman_elicit_1.pdf |format=PDF |author=Ford, David N., Sterman, John D. |title=Expert Knowledge Elicitation to Improve Mental and Formal Models |publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts, US - Massachusetts Institute of Technology |pages=18–23 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as "deeply held images of thinking and acting".&lt;ref&gt;"Leading for a Change", Ralph Jacobson, 2000, Chapter 5, Page102&lt;/ref&gt; Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.

===Expression of mental models of dynamic systems===
S.N. Groesser and M. Schaffernicht (2012) describe three basic methods which are typically used:
* [[Causal loop diagram]]s – displaying tendency and a direction of information connections and the resulting causality and feedback loops
* System structure diagrams – another way to express the structure of a qualitative dynamic system
* Stock and flow diagrams - a way to quantify the structure of a dynamic system
These methods allow showing a mental model of a dynamic system, as an explicit, written model about a certain system based on internal beliefs. Analyzing these graphical representations has been an increasing area of research across many social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Natalie A. |last2=Ross |first2=Helen |last3=Lynam |first3=Timothy |last4=Perez |first4=Pascal |last5=Leitch |first5=Anne |title=Mental Models:  An Interdisciplinary Synthesis of Theory and Methods |journal=Ecology and Society |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |doi=10.5751/ES-03802-160146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally software tools that attempt to capture and analyze the structural and functional properties of individual mental models such as Mental Modeler, "a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalmodeler.org/resources/Gray%20et%20al%20Mental%20Modeler%202013.pdf|title=Mental Modeler: A Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping Modeling Tool for Adaptive Environmental Management|author=|date=|website=mentalmodeler.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recently been developed and used to collect/compare/combine mental model representations collected from individuals for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.

===Mental model in relation to system dynamics and systemic thinking===
In the simplification of reality, creating a model can find a sense of reality, seeking to overcome [[systemic thinking]] and [[system dynamics]].

These two disciplines can help to construct a better coordination with the reality of mental models and simulate it accurately. They increase the probability that the consequences of how to decide and act in accordance with how to plan.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"/&gt;

* '''[[System dynamics]]''' – extending mental models through the creation of explicit models, which are clear, easily communicated and can be compared with each other.
* '''[[Systemic thinking]]''' – seeking the means to improve the mental models and thereby improve the quality of dynamic decisions that are based on mental models.

===Single and double-loop learning===
After analyzing the basic characteristics, it is necessary to bring the process of changing the mental models, or the process of learning. [[Learning]] is a back-loop [[wikt:process|process]], and [[feedback]] loops can be illustrated as: single-loop learning or double-loop learning.

====Single-loop learning====
Mental models affect the way that people work with information, and also how they determine the final decision. The decision itself changes, but the mental models remain the same. It is the predominant method of learning, because it is very convenient.

====Double-loop learning====
{{Main|Double-loop learning}}
Double-loop learning (''see diagram below'') is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.&lt;ref name="mild2003"/&gt;

{{GeoGroup|article=Operation Flintlock (nuclear test)}}

The '''United States's Flintlock nuclear test series'''&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; was a group of 47 [[nuclear test]]s conducted in 1965-1966. These tests &lt;ref group=note&gt;A bomb test may be a salvo test, defined as two or more explosions "where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, each of them connecting two burial points and does not exceed 40 kilometers in length". {{cite paper|first=V.

 |-
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Name &lt;ref group=note&gt;The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions &amp;ndash; Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event.  The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 &amp;ndash; 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Date time ([[Universal Time|UT]])
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Local [[Time Zone|time zone]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. All historical timezone data are derived from here:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Timezone Historical Database| publisher=iana.com| url=http://www.ietf.org/timezones/| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear test sites|Location]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Rough place name and a latitude/longitude reference; for rocket-carried tests, the launch location is specified before the detonation location, if known. Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height &lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery &lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose &lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear weapons|Device]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Designations for test items where known, "?" indicates some uncertainty about the preceding value, nicknames for particular devices in quotes. This category of information is often not officially disclosed.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Nuclear weapon yield|Yield]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Estimated energy yield in [[TNT equivalent|tons, kilotons, and megatons]]. A ton of TNT equivalent is defined as 4.184&amp;nbsp;gigajoules (1&amp;nbsp;gigacalorie).&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" class="unsortable" | [[Nuclear fallout|Fallout]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Radioactive emission to the atmosphere aside from prompt neutrons, where known.  The measured species is only iodine-131 if mentioned, otherwise it is all species. No entry means unknown, probably none if underground and "all" if not; otherwise notation for whether measured on the site only or off the site, where known, and the measured amount of radioactivity released.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{GeoGroup|article=Operation Hardtack II}}

'''Operation Hardtack II'''&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; was a series of 37 [[nuclear test]]s conducted by the United States in 1958 at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. These tests followed the ''[[Operation Argus]]'' series and preceded the ''[[Operation Nougat]]'' series.

With test moratoriums on the horizon, American weapons labs rushed out many new designs. A hard deadline for testing was set at midnight (0000 hrs), October 31, 1958, as negotiations were set to start that day, and the schedule shows it, with 29 tests executed in October, four of them on the last day.  One other test was cancelled because weather delays postponed it across the midnight deadline.  After the conclusion of Hardtack II, the United States announced a unilateral testing moratorium, which the Soviet Union joined after two last tests on November 1 and 3.&lt;ref&gt;http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1961, the Soviet Union resumed nuclear testing — this period included the test of the most powerful nuclear device ever designed, the ''[[Tsar Bomba]]'' on October 30, 1961 — and the United States followed suit with ''[[Operation Nougat]]''.

 |+ United States' Hardtack II series tests and detonations
 |-
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Name &lt;ref group=note&gt;The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions &amp;ndash; Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event.  The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 &amp;ndash; 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Date time ([[Universal Time|UT]])
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Local [[Time Zone|time zone]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. All historical timezone data are derived from here:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Timezone Historical Database| publisher=iana.com| url=http://www.ietf.org/timezones/| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear test sites|Location]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Rough place name and a latitude/longitude reference; for rocket-carried tests, the launch location is specified before the detonation location, if known. Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height &lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery &lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose &lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear weapons|Device]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Designations for test items where known, "?" indicates some uncertainty about the preceding value, nicknames for particular devices in quotes. This category of information is often not officially disclosed.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Nuclear weapon yield|Yield]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Estimated energy yield in [[TNT equivalent|tons, kilotons, and megatons]]. A ton of TNT equivalent is defined as 4.184&amp;nbsp;gigajoules (1&amp;nbsp;gigacalorie).&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" class="unsortable" | [[Nuclear fallout|Fallout]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Radioactive emission to the atmosphere aside from prompt neutrons, where known.  The measured species is only iodine-131 if mentioned, otherwise it is all species. No entry means unknown, probably none if underground and "all" if not; otherwise notation for whether measured on the site only or off the site, where known, and the measured amount of radioactivity released.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''public participation geographic information system''' ('''PPGIS''') is meant to bring the academic practices of [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and mapping to the local level in order to promote knowledge production by local and non-governmental groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuurman|first1=Nadine|title=GIS: A Short Introduction|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=USA, UK, Australia|isbn=978-0-631-23533-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind PPGIS is empowerment and inclusion of marginalized populations, who have little voice in the public arena, through geographic technology education and participation. PPGIS uses and produces digital maps, satellite imagery, sketch maps, and many other spatial and visual tools, to change geographic involvement and awareness on a local level. The term was coined in 1996 at the meetings of the [[National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis]] (NCGIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuurman|first1=Nadine|title=GIS: A Short Introduction|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=USA, UK, Australia|isbn=978-0-631-23533-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sieber, R. 2006. Public Participation and Geographic Information Systems: A Literature Review and Framework. ''Annals of the American Association of Geographers'', 96/3:491-507&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~schroedr/ppgis/ppgishom.html Public Participation GIS, NCGIA Workshop (Orono, Maine, US, 10–13 July 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Attendees to the ''Mapping for Change International Conference on Participatory Spatial Information Management and Communication'' conferred to at least three potential implications of PPGIS; it can: (1) enhance capacity in generating, managing, and communicating spatial information; (2) stimulate innovation; and ultimately; (3) encourage positive social change.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, et al. 2006. [http://www.iied.org/NR/agbioliv/pla_notes/documents/NEWch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf Overview: Mapping for Change-the emergence of a new practice]. ''Participatory Learning and Action'', 54:13–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  This reflects on the rather nebulous definition of PPGIS as referenced in the ''Encyclopedia of GIS''&lt;ref&gt;Tulloch, D., 2008. "Public Participation GIS (PPGIS)," in K. Kemp (Eds.) ''Encyclopedia of GIS'': Sage Publications, p. 351-353.&lt;/ref&gt; which describes PPGIS as having a definition problem.

There are a range of applications for PPGIS. The potential outcomes can be applied from community and [[neighborhood planning]] and development to environmental and [[natural resource management]].  Marginalized groups, be they [[grassroots]] organizations to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous populations]] could benefit from GIS technology.

Governments, [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organizations]] and [[Non-profit organization|non-profit groups]] are a big force behind many programs. The current extent of PPGIS programs in the US has been evaluated by Sawicki and Peterman.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, et al. 2002. ''Community Participation and Geographic Information Systems''. London: Taylor and Francis&lt;/ref&gt; They catalog over 60 PPGIS programs who aid in "public participation in community decision making by providing local-area data to community groups," in the United States (Craig et al., 2002:24).  The organizations providing these programs are mostly universities, local [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]], non-profit [[Foundation (charity)|foundations]].

In general, neighborhood empowerment groups can form and gain access to information that is normally very easy for the official government and planning offices to obtain.  It is easier for this to happen than for individuals of lower-income neighborhoods just working by themselves. There have been several projects where university students help implement GIS in neighborhoods and communities.  It is believed{{By whom|date=April 2010}} that access to information is the doorway to more effective government for everybody and community empowerment.  In a case study of a group in Milwaukee, residents of an [[inner city]] neighborhood became active participants in building a community information system, learning to access public information and create and analyze new databases derived from their own surveys, all with the purpose of making these residents useful actors in city management and in the formation of public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ghose 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  In many cases, there are providers of data for community groups, but the groups may not know that such entities exist.  Getting the word out would be beneficial.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Some of the spatial data that the neighborhood wanted was information on abandoned or boarded-up buildings and homes, vacant lots, and properties that contained garbage, rubbish and debris that contributed to health and safety issues in the area.  They also appreciated being able to find landlords that were not keeping up the properties.  The university team and the community were able to build databases and make maps that would help them find these areas and perform the spatial analysis that they needed.  Community members learned how to use the computer resources, ArcView 1.0, and build a theme or land use map of the surrounding area.  They were able to perform spatial queries and analyze neighborhood problems.  Some of these problems included finding absentee landlords and finding code violations for the buildings on the maps (Ghose 2001).

==Approaches==
There are two approaches to PPGIS use and application. These two perspectives, top–down and bottom–up, are the currently debated schism in PPGIS.

===Top-down===
According to Sieber (2006), PPGIS was first envisioned as a means of mapping individuals by many social and economic demographic factors in order to analyze the spatial differences in access to social services.  She refers to this kind of PPGIS as ''top-down'', being that it is less hands on for the public, but theoretically serves the public by making adjustments for the deficiencies, and improvements in public management.&lt;ref&gt;Sieber, R. 2006. Public Participation and Geographic Information Systems: A Literature Review and Framework. ''Annals of the American Association of Geographers'', 96/3:491-507&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bottom-up===
A current trend with academic involvement in PPGIS, is researching existing programs, and or starting programs in order to collect data on the effectiveness of PPGIS.  Elwood (2006) in ''The Professional Geographer'', talks in depth about the "everyday inclusions, exclusions, and contradictions of Participatory GIS research."&lt;ref&gt;Elwood, S. 2006. Negotiating Knowledge Production: The Everyday Inclusions, Exclusions, and Contradictions of Participatory GIS Research. ''The Professional Geographer'', 58/2:197.&lt;/ref&gt;   The research is being conducted in order to evaluate if PPGIS is involving the public equally.  In reference to Sieber's top-down PPGIS, this is a counter method of PPGIS, rightly referred to as ''bottom-up'' PPGIS.  Its purpose is to work with the public to let them learn the technologies, then producing their own GIS.

Public participation GIS is defined by Sieber as the use of geographic information systems to broaden public involvement in policymaking as well as to the value of GIS to promote the goals of nongovernmental organizations, grassroots groups and community-based organizations (Sieber 2006).  It would seem on the surface that PPGIS, as it is commonly referred to, in this sense would be of a beneficial nature to those in the community or area that is being represented.  But in truth only certain groups or individuals will be able to obtain the technology and use it.  Is PPGIS becoming more available to the underprivileged sector of the community?  The question of "who benefits?" should always be asked, and does this harm a community or group of individuals.

The local, participatory management of urban neighborhoods usually follows on from 'claiming the territory', and has to be made compatible with national or local authority regulations on administering, managing and planning urban territory (McCall 2003). PPGIS applied to participatory community/neighborhood planning has been examined by, among many others, [Howard (1999)], [Carver, Evans, Kingston, and Turton (1999)], [Leitner, McMaster, Elwood, McMaster, and Sheppard (2002)], and [Talen (1999)]. Specific attention has been given to applications such as housing issues (e.g. [Elwood (2002)]) or neighborhood revitalization (e.g. [Craig &amp; Elwood (1998)]). Spatial databases along with the P-mapping are used to maintain a public records GIS or community land information systems (e.g. [Ventura, Niemann, Sutphin, &amp; Chenoweth (2002)]).  These are just a few of the uses of GIS in the community.

====Examples====

Public Participation in decision making processes works not only to identify areas of common values or variability, but also as an illustrative and instructional tool.  One example of effective dialogue and building trust between the community and decision makers comes from pre-planning for development in the United Kingdom.  It involves using GIS and [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA) to make a decision about wind farm siting.  This method hinges upon taking all stakeholder perspectives into account to improve chances of reaching consensus .  This also creates a more transparent process and adds weight to the final decision by building upon traditional methods such as public meetings and hearings, surveys, focus groups, and deliberative processes enabling participants more insights and more informed opinions on environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;Higgs, G., Berry, R., Kidner, D, Langford, M. Using IT approaches to promote public participation in renewable energy planning: Prospects and challenges.  2008.  Land Use Policy 25, 596-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative processes that consider objective and subjective inputs have the potential to efficiently address some of the conflict between development and nature as they involve a fuller justification by wind farm developers for location, scale, and design.  Spatial tools such as creation of 3D view sheds offer participants new ways of assessing visual intrusion to make a more informed decision.  Higgs et al. make a very telling statement when analyzing the success of this project – "the only way of accommodating people's landscape concerns is to site wind farms in places that people find more acceptable".  This implies that developers recognize the validity of citizens' concerns and are willing to compromise in identifying sites where wind farms will not only be successful financially, but also successful politically and socially.  This creates greater accountability and facilitates the incorporation of stakeholder values to resolve differences and gain public acceptance for vital development projects.

In another planning example, Simao et al. analyzed how to create sustainable development options with widespread community support.  They determined that stakeholders need to learn likely outcomes that result from stated preferences, which can be supported through enhanced access to information and incentives to increase public participation.  Through a multi-criteria spatial [[decision support system]] stakeholders were able to voice concerns and work on a compromise solution to have final outcome accepted by majority when siting wind farms.  This differs from the work of Higgs et al. in that the focus was on allowing users to learn from the collaborative process, both interactively and iteratively about the nature of the problem and their own preferences for desirable characteristics of solution.

This stimulated sharing of opinions and discussion of interests behind preferences.  After understanding the problem more fully, participants could discuss alternative solutions and interact with other participants to come to a compromise solution.&lt;ref&gt;Simao, A., Densham, P.J., Haklay, M.  Web-based GIS for collaborative planning and public participation: An application to the strategic planning of wind farm sites.  2009, Journal of Environmental Management, 90, 2027-2040&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar work has been done to incorporate public participation in spatial planning for transportation system development,&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, E. A model for public involvement programming using participatory Geographic Information Systems.  2008.  Computers, Environment, and Urban Systems 32 (2008) 123–133&lt;/ref&gt; and this method of two-way benefits is even beginning to move towards web-based mapping services to further simplify and extend the process into the community.&lt;ref&gt;Kingston, R.

(2007)The Cartographic journal Vol. 44 No. 2 pp. 138–144 ICA Special Issue 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4406">'''Reino Antero Hirvonen''' (1908&amp;ndash;1989) was a famous
[[Finland|Finnish]] physical [[geodesist]], also well known for
contributions in mathematical and astronomical geodesy.

He worked at first at the [[Finnish Geodetic Institute]] under [[Weikko Aleksanteri Heiskanen|W.A. Heiskanen]] on gravimetric [[Undulation of the geoid|geoid]] determination, publishing his dissertation ''The Continental Undulations of the Geoid''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Continental Undulations of the Geoid|author=R.A. Hirvonen|year=1934|publisher=Finnish Geodetic Institute|series=Publication|number=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1934 on the determination of a global geoid model from only 4500 data points.

In 1950 he succeeded Heiskanen as Professor of [[Geodesy]] at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]].

He also took an active interest in astronomy, acting from 1956 to 1964 as a
vice president of the Finnish amateur astronomical society [[Ursa (Finland)|Ursa]].

R.A. Hirvonen participated in the 1930s in the construction of triangulation towers, and measurements, for the first order triangulation of Finland. He also developed over the years many new mathematical algorithms for manual calculations (before the computer era), e.g., for calculating the Gauss-Krüger map projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Die Gauss-Krügersche Projektion für breite Meridianstreifen auf dem Internationalen Ellipsoide|author=R.A. Hirvonen|year=1949|publisher=Finnish Geodetic Institute|series=Publication|number=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 he led a team of Finnish scientists to Brazil to measure the distance between South America and Africa. (T.J. Kukkamäki was the leader of the team sent to, then, Gold Coast, Africa.) They succeed with measurements using a method based on observing from points in Brazil and Africa. They used the solar eclipse happening that year, which was visible in both Africa and South America. Using long focus film cameras and the most accurate available radio time signals for the solar eclipse measurements, they were able to calculate the distance between Africa and South America to a higher accuracy than ever before: 141 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Geodetic Research in Finland in the 20th Century|author=J. Kakkuri|year=2001|journal=Geophysica|volume=37|number=1-2|pages=33–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1951–1952 and 1954–1955 Hirvonen lectured in the Department of Geodetic Science at The [[Ohio State University]], in Columbus, Ohio (USA). He educated the students about navigation using the stars as reference points. Later it helped the USA to fly to the moon{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

==Awards==

In 1967 he received the Kaarina and Weikko A. Heiskanen Award ([[Ohio State University]]).

'''''Shackleton''''' is a 2001 British [[television film]] written and directed by [[Charles Sturridge]] and starring [[Kenneth Branagh]] as explorer [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]]. The film tells the true story of Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|1914 Antarctic expedition]] on the ship ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]''. The cast includes [[Kevin McNally]], [[Lorcan Cranitch]], [[Embeth Davidtz]], [[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]], [[Matt Day]] and [[Phoebe Nicholls]] (also the director's wife) as Lady Shackleton. It was filmed in the UK, [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]. The film used first-hand accounts by the men on the expedition to retell the story. Shackleton biographer [[Roland Huntford]] was a production advisor.

''Shackleton'' was first broadcast in two parts by [[Channel 4]] in January 2002. In [[North America]] the film was first broadcast by the [[A&amp;E Network]] in April 2002. The film was nominated for seven [[Emmy Awards]],&lt;ref name="emmys"/&gt;  six [[BAFTA Awards]],&lt;ref name="bafta"/&gt; and a [[Golden Globe Award]].&lt;ref name="golden-globes"/&gt;

==Plot==
The films tells the true story of explorer [[Ernest Shackleton|Sir Ernest Shackleton]] ([[Kenneth Branagh]]) and his [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|1914 Antarctic expedition]] on the ship ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]''. The story begins with him planning the expedition and finding [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]], particularly [[James Key Caird|Sir James Caird]]. Shackleton's goal is to drive [[Dog sled|dog sled teams]] from one side of Antarctica to the other, which would make Britain the first nation to undertake such a trans-continental journey.

Once the expedition is underway, trouble arises due to thick [[sea ice]] and low temperatures. ''Endurance'' becomes trapped and eventually crushed by [[pack ice]]. Shackleton vows to find a way to rescue the men. He undertakes an epic journey across the ice, followed by 800 miles of the [[Southern Ocean]] and then an uncharted mountain range on [[South Georgia Island]]. He finds a [[whaling]] station from which rescue parties are sent to collect his entire [[shipwreck]]ed crew. The otherwise failed expedition is made famous for every crew member surviving despite insurmountable odds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45664">The tables contain the [[integer factorization|prime factorization]] of the [[natural number]]s from 1 to 1000.

When ''n'' is a [[prime number]], the prime factorization is just ''n'' itself, written in '''bold''' below.

The number [[1 (number)|1]] is called a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]]. It has no [[prime factor]]s and is neither prime nor [[composite number|composite]].

''See also: [[Table of divisors]]'' (prime and non-prime divisors for 1 to 1000)


== Properties ==
Many properties of a natural number ''n'' can be seen or directly computed from the prime factorization of ''n''.
*The '''multiplicity''' of a prime factor ''p'' of ''n'' is the largest exponent ''m'' for which ''p&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' divides ''n''. The tables show the multiplicity for each prime factor. If no exponent is written then the multiplicity is 1 (since ''p'' = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The multiplicity of a prime which does not divide ''n'' may be called 0 or may be considered undefined.
*Ω(''n''), the [[Big Omega function (prime factor)|big Omega function]], is the number of prime factors of ''n'' counted with multiplicity (so it is the sum of all prime factor multiplicities).
*A [[prime number]] has Ω(''n'') = 1. The first: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37 {{OEIS|id=A000040}}. There are many special [[List of prime numbers|types of prime numbers]].
*A [[composite number]] has Ω(''n'') &gt; 1. The first: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21 {{OEIS|id=A002808}}. All numbers above 1 are either prime or composite. 1 is neither.
*A [[semiprime]] has Ω(''n'') = 2 (so it is composite). The first: 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26, 33, 34 {{OEIS|id=A001358}}.
*A ''k''-[[almost prime]] (for a natural number ''k'') has Ω(''n'') = ''k'' (so it is composite if ''k'' &gt; 1).
*An [[even number]] has the prime factor 2. The first: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 {{OEIS|id=A005843}}.
*An [[odd number]] does not have the prime factor 2. The first: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 {{OEIS|id=A005408}}. All integers are either even or odd.
*A [[Square number|square]] has even multiplicity for all prime factors (it is of the form ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''a''). The first: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144 {{OEIS|id=A000290}}.
*A [[cube (arithmetic)|cube]] has all multiplicities divisible by 3 (it is of the form ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''a''). The first: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1331, 1728 {{OEIS|id=A000578}}.
*A [[perfect power]] has a common divisor ''m'' &gt; 1 for all multiplicities (it is of the form ''a&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' for some ''a'' &gt; 1 and ''m'' &gt; 1). The first: 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 {{OEIS|id=A001597}}. 1 is sometimes included.
*A [[powerful number]] (also called '''squareful''') has multiplicity above 1 for all prime factors. The first: 1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 72 {{OEIS|id=A001694}}.
*A [[prime power]] has only one prime factor. The first: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 {{OEIS|id=A000961}}. 1 is sometimes included.
*An [[Achilles number]] is powerful but not a perfect power. The first: 72, 108, 200, 288, 392, 432, 500, 648, 675, 800, 864, 968 {{OEIS|id=A052486}}.
*A [[square-free integer]] has no prime factor with multiplicity above 1. The first: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17 {{OEIS|id=A005117}}). A number where some but not all prime factors have multiplicity above 1 is neither square-free nor squareful.
*The [[Liouville function]] λ(''n'') is 1 if Ω(''n'') is even, and is -1 if Ω(''n'') is odd.
*The [[Möbius function]] μ(''n'') is 0 if ''n'' is not square-free. Otherwise μ(''n'') is 1 if Ω(''n'') is even, and is −1 if Ω(''n'') is odd.
*A [[sphenic number]] has Ω(''n'') = 3 and is square-free (so it is the product of 3 distinct primes). The first: 30, 42, 66, 70, 78, 102, 105, 110, 114, 130, 138, 154 {{OEIS|id=A007304}}.
*''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is the sum of primes dividing ''n'', counted with multiplicity. It is an [[additive function]].
*A [[Ruth-Aaron pair]] is two consecutive numbers (''x'', ''x''+1) with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''+1). The first (by ''x'' value): 5, 8, 15, 77, 125, 714, 948, 1330, 1520, 1862, 2491, 3248 {{OEIS|id=A039752}}, another definition is the same prime only count once, if so, the first (by ''x'' value): 5, 24, 49, 77, 104, 153, 369, 492, 714, 1682, 2107, 2299 {{OEIS|id=A006145}}
*A [[primorial]] ''x''# is the product of all primes from 2 to ''x''. The first: 2, 6, 30, 210, 2310, 30030, 510510, 9699690, 223092870, 6469693230, 200560490130, 7420738134810 {{OEIS|id=A002110}}. 1# = 1 is sometimes included.
*A [[factorial]] ''x''! is the product of all numbers from 1 to ''x''. The first: 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800, 39916800, 479001600 {{OEIS|id=A000142}}. 0! = 1 is sometimes included.
*A ''k''-[[smooth number]] (for a natural number ''k'') has largest prime factor ≤ ''k'' (so it is also ''j''-smooth for any ''j'' &gt; k).
*''m'' is '''smoother''' than ''n'' if the largest prime factor of ''m'' is below the largest of ''n''.
*A [[regular number]] has no prime factor above 5 (so it is 5-smooth). The first: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16 {{OEIS|id=A051037}}.
*A ''k''-[[smooth number#Powersmooth numbers|powersmooth]] number has all ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''k'' where ''p'' is a prime factor with multiplicity ''m''.
*A [[frugal number]] has more digits than the number of digits in its prime factorization (when written like below tables with multiplicities above 1 as exponents). The first in [[decimal]]: 125, 128, 243, 256, 343, 512, 625, 729, 1024, 1029, 1215, 1250 {{OEIS|id=A046759}}.
*An [[equidigital number]] has the same number of digits as its prime factorization. The first in decimal: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 {{OEIS|id=A046758}}.
*An [[extravagant number]] has fewer digits than its prime factorization. The first in decimal: 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 {{OEIS|id=A046760}}.
*An '''economical number''' has been defined as a frugal number, but also as a number that is either frugal or equidigital.
*gcd(''m'', ''n'') ([[greatest common divisor]] of ''m'' and ''n'') is the product of all prime factors which are both in ''m'' and ''n'' (with the smallest multiplicity for ''m'' and ''n'').
*''m'' and ''n'' are [[coprime]] (also called relatively prime) if gcd(''m'', ''n'') = 1 (meaning they have no common prime factor).
*lcm(''m'', ''n'') ([[least common multiple]] of ''m'' and ''n'') is the product of all prime factors of ''m'' or ''n'' (with the largest multiplicity for ''m'' or ''n'').
*gcd(''m'', ''n'') × lcm(''m'', ''n'') = ''m'' × ''n''. Finding the prime factors is often harder than to compute gcd and lcm with other algorithms which do not require known prime factorization.
*''m'' is a [[divisor]] of ''n'' (also called ''m'' divides ''n'', or ''n'' is divisible by ''m'') if all prime factors of ''m'' have at least the same multiplicity in ''n''.
The divisors of ''n'' are all products of some or all prime factors of ''n'' (including the empty product 1 of no prime factors).
The number of divisors can be computed by increasing all multiplicities by 1 and then multiplying them.
Divisors and properties related to divisors are shown in [[table of divisors]].

'''Technological momentum''' is a theory about the relationship between [[technology]] and [[society]] over time. The term, which is considered a fourth technological determinism variant,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Philosophy of Technology: From Technical Artefacts to Sociotechnical Systems|last=Vermaas|first=Peter|last2=Kroes|first2=Peter|last3=Franssen|first3=Maarten|last4=van de Poel|first4=Ibo|last5=Houkes|first5=Wybo|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9781608455980|location=San Rafael, CA|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; was originally developed by the [[history of technology|historian of technology]] [[Thomas P. Hughes]]. The idea is that relationship between technology and society is reciprocal and time-dependent so that one does not determine the changes in the other but both influence each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Green Technology: An A-to-Z Guide|last=Mulvaney|first=Dustin|last2=Robbins|first2=Paul|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|isbn=9781412996921|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Hughes's thesis is a synthesis of two separate models for how technology and society interact. One, ''[[technological determinism]]'', claims that society itself is modified by the introduction of a new technology in an irreversible and irreparable way&amp;mdash;for example, the introduction of the [[automobile]] has influenced the manner in which [[United States of America|American]] cities are designed, a change that can clearly be seen when comparing the pre-automobile cities on the East Coast to the post-automobile cities on the West Coast. Technology, under this model, self-propagates as well&amp;mdash;there is no turning back once the adoption has taken place, and the very existence of the technology means that it will continue to exist in the future.

The other model, ''[[social determinism]]'', claims that society itself controls how a technology is used and developed&amp;mdash;for example, the rejection of [[nuclear power]] technology in the USA amid the public fears after the [[Three Mile Island]] incident.

''Technological momentum'' takes the two models and adds ''time'' as the unifying factor. In Hughes's theory, when a technology is young, deliberate control over its use and scope is possible and enacted by society. However, as a technology matures, and becomes increasingly enmeshed in the society where it was created, its own deterministic force takes hold, achieving technological momentum in the process. According to Hughes this inertia, which is particularly the case for large technological systems with their technological and social components, makes them difficult to influence and steer as they start to go more on their own way, assuming deterministic traits in the process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In other words, Hughes's says that the relationship between technology and society always starts with a ''social determinism'' model, but evolves into a form of ''technological determinism'' over time and as its use becomes more prevalent and important.

Since its introduction by Hughes, the ''technological momentum'' concept has been applied by a number of other historians of technology.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Consuming Power: A Social History of American Energies'' (1998) by [[David E. Nye]]; "Technology and War: A Bibliographic Essay" by Alex Roland in ''Military Enterprise and Technological Change'' (1985), edited by Merritt Roe Smith; and ''Nuclear Fallacies: How We Have Been Misguided since Hiroshima'' (1985) by Robert W. Malcomson.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it is considered an effective approach to reconciling the apparently opposite perspectives of the autonomy of technology and the social and political motivations behind technological choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democratizing Technology: Andrew Feenberg's Critical Theory of Technology|last=Borgmann|first=Albert|last2=Cooper|first2=Simon|last3=Doppelt|first3=Gerlad|last4=Feenberg|first4=Andrew|last5=Glazebrook|first5=Trish|last6=Hickman|first6=Larry|last7=Light|first7=Andrew|last8=Stump|first8=David|last9=Thompson|first9=Paul|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2006|isbn=9780791469170|location=New York|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is able to describe how socially and politically conditioned technological institutions become independent and autonomous over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10031">'''Torc Robotics''' (Torc) is an American [[autonomous vehicle]] company&lt;ref name=torcRoboticsToExpand /&gt; headquartered in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]]. Torc produces  unmanned and autonomous technology that retrofits to existing machinery and vehicles. Its custom products, software and automation kits have been used on vehicles in several industries,&lt;ref name=blacksburgCompanyInvolvedIn/&gt; including military, mining agriculture, and automotive over the last decade.

Through 2014, 50 percent of Torc’s revenue came from defense work and the rest from commercial customers.&lt;ref name=lookMomNoHands/&gt; Some of its end users include the [[United States Department of Defense]],&lt;ref name=obstacleDetection/&gt; the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]],&lt;ref name=marineCorps/&gt; [[Air Force Research Laboratory|Air Force Research Labs]] (AFRL),&lt;ref name=assaultRunway/&gt; [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]],&lt;ref name=caterpillar/&gt; and DCD Protected Mobility.&lt;ref name=protectedMobility/&gt;

== History ==

In 2005, the company was founded by a group of [[Virginia Tech]] graduate students including Michael Fleming,&lt;ref name=vtMag/&gt; the current CEO.

Torc partnered with Virginia Tech to compete in the [[DARPA Grand Challenge (2007)|2007 Urban Challenge]],&lt;ref name=lookMomNoHands/&gt; hosted by the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]). Teams were challenged to build a fully autonomous vehicle that could travel 60 miles of urban and off-road environments in less than six hours.

Torc’s [[Ford Escape]] vehicle, named Odin, placed third out of 35 competing teams, winning the $500,000 prize.&lt;ref name=torcDarpaComplete/&gt; The other top-2 finishers included Tartan Racing, of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and [[General Motors Corp.]], and the [[Stanford University|Stanford]] Racing Team.

In 2010, Torc partnered with a robotics team at [[Virginia Tech]] to develop a vehicle for the National Federation of the Blind’s (NFB) Blind Driver Challenge.&lt;ref name=blindDriver/&gt;  The team received the National Instruments’ 2010 Application of the Year for the project.&lt;ref name=blindDriverWin/&gt;

Using a Ford Escape, Torc implemented its ByWire drive-by-wire conversion modules, Safestop wireless emergency stop system, and PowerHub distribution modules on the vehicle.&lt;ref name=alliedVision/&gt;

On January 29, 2011, a blind driver independently drove Torc’s vehicle down the main straightaway, onto the road course at the [[Daytona Speedway]].&lt;ref name=daytonaSpeedway/&gt;

In 2012, Torc researchers participated in the [[DARPA Robotics Challenge]] (DRC) with Team ViGIR (Virginia-Germany Interdisciplinary Robotics Team).&lt;ref name=teamVigir/&gt; The program challenged teams to develop robotic software and hardware capabilities to support first responders. The team made it to the finale.&lt;ref name=2CoeTeams/&gt;

Torc’s technology is currently being used in military applications in various parts of the world. One such vehicle is GUSS (Ground Unmanned Support Surrogate) an autonomous vehicle used to carry equipment for the Marines.&lt;ref name=combatLandscape/&gt; Torc has also developed an advanced sensor fusion system for the Department of Defense that is used to increase high-speed obstacle detection, classification and prediction.&lt;ref name= obstacleDetection/&gt;

In 2012, Torc’s autonomous vehicle for Air Force Research Labs (AFRL) demonstrated its ability to perform expedient runway surveys, collect soil hardness measurements, provide terrain date and report hazards to flight.&lt;ref name= assaultRunway/&gt;

Torc developed a remote control solution for hazardous mining areas.&lt;ref name=miningTechnology/&gt; The team replicated the cab of a 240-ton haul truck and developed a teleoperated control system to allow operators to teleoperate the haul truck from a safe distance away.

Torc participated in a successful five-vehicle platoon test in 2015 with the U.S. [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA)’s Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory.&lt;ref name=platoon/&gt; The test was conducted on an inactive naval air base in [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania]].

In July, 2017, Torc was the first company that registered with [[Washington state]]’s Autonomous Vehicle Pilot Program permit to perform a certified test with its self-driving car in Washington.&lt;ref name=selfDrivingCarArrives/&gt;

On July 26, 2017, one of Torc’s self-driving cars completed a cross country trip, with over 4,300 miles driven autonomously. The team completed the trip in [[Richmond, Virginia]], where they were greeted by Virginia Governor [[Terry McAuliffe]].&lt;ref name=carDrove4300Miles/&gt;

An '''[[Undergraduate research|Undergraduate Research]] Opportunities Program''' provides funding and/or credit to [[undergraduate]] students who volunteer for faculty-mentored research projects pertaining to all academic disciplines at universities such as [[The University of Queensland]], [[Boston University]], the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (Georgia Tech), the [[University of California, Irvine]], [[California State University Long Beach|California State University, Long Beach]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), the [[University of Michigan]], the [[University of Michigan-Flint]], [[Florida State University]], the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] (HKUST), the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]], the [[RWTH Aachen University]], [[Imperial College London]], the [[University of New Hampshire]], the [[Nanyang Technological University]] and the [[University of Oregon]].

The MIT program was founded in 1969, and the program at the [[University of Michigan]] was founded in the 1989 (primarily to help [[minorities]] and women break into science and mathematics). The University of California, Irvine founded its program in 1995. In the United Kingdom, [[Imperial College London]] provides a program for doing research in most of its departments for undergraduates at Imperial. Furthermore, the UROP scheme is also available at the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Reading]], the [[University of Essex]] and the [[National University of Singapore]]. In 2008 the [[RWTH Aachen]] University started the first international UROP program for students from the United States and Canada in Germany. The [[University of Sussex]] runs a similar scheme, across all of its departments, where undergraduates are funded for 6 weeks as Junior Research Associates. The California State University, Long Beach program does not serve transfer students.

Students can apply for funding by submitting a proposal during "Calls for Proposals", which occur throughout the school year.

The Calls are announced on the school web sites and distributed to faculty members and the undergraduate counseling offices. Students have approximately one month from the announcement to submit their proposals. All undergraduate students from all disciplines and majors who are participating in a research project with a faculty advisor (usually a full-time professor at the university) eligible to respond to the current Call for Proposals if they are in good academic standing with the school.

Proposals are prepared by the student applicant and jointly submitted by the student and the faculty advisors. UROP funds a variety of projects with grants depending upon the merits of the project. At [[UC Irvine]], an individual student may receive up to $1,000 through UROP for projects during the school year, to help pay for supplies and other necessary materials. Alternatively, [[UC Irvine]] students may also apply for a prestigious summer [[Fellow|fellowship]], by which they may be awarded as much as $3,000 per project, which is meant to reward them for their time and efforts. Higher amounts may be awarded for group projects. The UROP Faculty Advisory Board reviews proposals and decides whether the project merits funding. The UROP Faculty Advisory Board also makes the funding recommendations.

Upon completion of the year-long research project, students are expected to present their findings at the school's research symposium&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/news/urop-symposium-features-student-research-projects|title=UROP Symposium features student research projects|work=The Michigan Daily|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although not a requirement, some students may submit their written reports (ranging from 15-25 pages) to the faculty committee in order to be considered for publication in the university's research journals. Publication in the UROP undergraduate research journal is known to be extremely competitive. In many cases, students are asked to submit numerous drafts to the faculty committee for review, only to find out that their papers are later denied publication. In the past, a mere 5% of all submissions were accepted for publication in the [[UC Irvine]] and [[MIT]] journals.

In addition, the [[University of Michigan]] housing also offers a UROP in residence option, called the [[Michigan Research Community]], or MRC. This is an option for UROP students to live with each other and get an in-depth education in the [[University of Michigan|University of Michigan's]] research. Additionally, students can also apply for a summer scholarship fellowship, in which students are given up to $3,000 to fund their own project.

'''The WISE Campaign''' (Women into Science and Engineering) encourages women and girls to value and pursue science, technology, engineering and maths-related courses in school or college and move on into related careers and progress. Its mission statement aims to facilitate understanding of these disciplines among women and girls and the opportunities which they present at a professional level. It is operated by [[UKRC]] trading as WISE (company number 07533934).&lt;ref name=WISEabout&gt;[http://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/about-us WISE website] About us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The campaign began on 17 January 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of WISE|url=http://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/about-us/30-years/history|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; headed by [[Beryl Platt, Baroness Platt of Writtle|The Baroness Platt of Writtle]], a qualified [[mechanical engineer]], at which time women made up 7% of graduate engineers and 3% of professional engineers in the UK.  It was a collaboration between the [[Engineering Council]] and the [[Equal Opportunities Commission (United Kingdom)|Equal Opportunities Commission]], originally viewed as a one-year campaign "Women into Science and Engineering" ''WISE'84''.&lt;ref name=NS1984&gt;Georgina Ferry, ''[[New Scientist]]'' 12 January 1984 pp 10&amp;ndash;11 "WISE Campaign for Women Engineers"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Times1984&gt;''[[The Times]]'', Wednesday, 18 January 1984 p 3 "More women urged to work in science"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
One of WISE's main objectives is to listen to students and women qualified or working in these sectors, and understand and voice their opinions to academic institutions, policy-makers and employers.  It then works creatively with delivery agencies and others, offering models, tools and approaches to support them in challenging traditional approaches, so as to demonstrate equitable involvement.  WISE combats gender stereotypes to get more girls and women involved in careers where female participation was once considered near impossible.

WISE operates throughout the UK, with specialist committees in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.  Volunteers, from industry and relevant organisations, attend the various WISE committee meetings, and undertake projects with WISE.

In 2011 the UKRC - an organisation specialising in gender equality in science, engineering and technology - became part of WISE.  [[Trudy Norris-Grey]], the Chair of UKRC since 2007 then became Chair of WISE.&lt;ref name=WISEBoard&gt;[http://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/about-us/wise-board-team WISE website] Board and Team&lt;/ref&gt;  WISE counts [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]], [[Julia Higgins|Dame Julia Higgins]], [[Kate Bellingham]] and [[Joanna Kennedy]] as its patrons. The Founding Chair and Patron [[Beryl Platt, Baroness Platt of Writtle|The Baroness Platt of Writtle]] died on 1 February 2015, aged 91.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Baroness Platt of Writtle|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/baroness-platt-of-writtle-aeronautical-engineer-who-went-on-to-the-house-of-lords-and-chaired-the-equal-opportunities-commission-10034494.html|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jess Wade]] sits on the WISE Board and has been instrumental in increasing the representation of [[Women in STEM fields|Women in STEM]] and promoting early career researchers.

==Structure==
It is headquartered at [[Leeds College of Building]], though has been based at the [[UKRC]] (UK Resource Centre for Women in Science, Engineering, and Technology) in Bradford.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="940">'''Wideband material''' refers to material that can convey [[Microwave]] signals (light/sound) over a variety of [[wavelength]]s. These materials possess exemplary attenuation and dielectric constants, and are excellent [[dielectric]]s for [[semiconductor gate]]s. Examples of such material include [[gallium nitride]] (GaN) and [[silicon carbide]] (SiC). 

SiC has been used extensively in the creation of [[laser]]s for several years. However, it performs poorly (providing limited brightness) because it has an [[indirect band gap]]. GaN has a wide band gap (~3.4 eV), which usually results in high energies for structures which possess [[electron]]s in the [[conduction band]].
