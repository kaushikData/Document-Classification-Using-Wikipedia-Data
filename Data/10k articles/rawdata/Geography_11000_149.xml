[[Image:Marianatrenchmap.png|thumb|300px|Location of Challenger Deep within the [[Mariana Trench]] and Western Pacific Ocean]]

The '''Challenger Deep''' is the deepest known point in the [[Earth]]'s [[seabed]] [[hydrosphere]], with a depth of {{convert|10898|to|10916|m|ft|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} by direct measurement from submersibles, and slightly more by [[sonar]] [[bathymetry]]. It is in the [[Pacific Ocean]], at the southern end of the [[Mariana Trench]] near the [[Mariana Islands]] group. The Challenger Deep is a relatively small slot-shaped depression in the bottom of a considerably larger crescent-shaped [[oceanic trench]], which itself is an unusually [[Hadal zone|deep feature]] in the ocean floor. The Challenger Deep's bottom is about {{convert|7|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide, with gently sloping sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=All Things Considered |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/09/148317355/film-director-to-travel-to-bottom-of-mariana-trench |title=Diving Back to the Bottom of the Mariana Trench |publisher=NPR |date=9 March 2012 |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest land to the Challenger Deep is [[Fais Island]] (one of the outer islands of [[Yap]]), {{convert|287|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest, and [[Guam]], {{convert|304|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northeast. It is located in the ocean territory of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], {{convert|1.6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from its border with ocean territory associated with Guam.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Colbert Report]], airdate: 2012 April 12, interview with [[James Cameron]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The depression is named after the British [[Royal Navy]] survey ship [[HMS Challenger (1858)|HMS ''Challenger'']], whose [[Challenger expedition|expedition of 1872–1876]] made the first recordings of its depth. According to the August 2011 version of the [[General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans|GEBCO]] Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names, the location and depth of the Challenger Deep are {{Coord|11|22.4|N|142|35.5|E}} and {{convert|10920|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/undersea_feature_names/#feature_links4|title=IHO-IOC GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names, August 2011 version|date=August 2011|publisher=GEBCO|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

June 2009 sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 (sonar multibeam bathymetry system for 300–11,000&amp;nbsp;m deep water mapping) aboard the [[RV Kilo Moana|RV ''Kilo Moana'']] indicated a depth of {{convert|10971|m|ft}}.

The high water pressure at this depth makes designing and operating exploratory craft difficult. Only four descents have ever been achieved. The first descent by any vehicle was by the manned [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'' in 1960. This was followed by the unmanned [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]] ''[[Kaikō]]'' in 1995 and ''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'' in 2009. In March 2012 a manned solo descent was made by film director [[James Cameron]] in the deep-submergence vehicle ''[[Deepsea Challenger]]''.&lt;ref name="NGS-20120325"&gt;{{cite web |last=Than|first=Ker |title=James Cameron Completes Record-Breaking Mariana Trench Dive|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120325-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deepest-returns-science-sub/|date=25 March 2012 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20120325"&gt;{{cite news |last=Broad|first=William J. |title=Filmmaker in Submarine Voyages to Bottom of Sea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/science/james-camerons-submarine-trip-to-challenger-deep.html|date=25 March 2012 |work=New York Times |accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC-20120325"&gt;{{cite web |author=AP Staff |title=James Cameron has reached deepest spot on Earth |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46850002/ns/technology_and_science-science |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of depth mapping from the surface==
Over many years, the search for the point of maximum depth has involved many different vessels.&lt;ref name="Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep"&gt;{{cite web |last=Nakanishi|first=Masao |title=A precise bathymetric map of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench |url=http://naosite.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10069/25460/1/MGR_Hashimoto.pdf |date=10 April 2011 |publisher=Faculty of Fisheries, Nagasaki University |accessdate=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] (December 1872 – May 1876) first [[Sounding line|sounded]] the depths now known as the Challenger Deep. This first sounding was made on 23 March 1875 at station 225.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.19thcenturyscience.org/HMSC/HMSC-Reports/1895-Summary/htm/doc877.html |title=Report on the scientific results of the voyage of H.M.S.

*A 1912 book, ''The Depths of the Ocean'' by [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]], records the depth of the Challenger Deep as {{convert|31614|ft|0|abbr=on}}, reporting the sounding taken by the converted navy collier {{USS|Nero|AC-17|6}} in 1899.&lt;ref name="Theberge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydro-international.com/issues/articles/id1049-Thirty_Years_of_Discovering_the_Mariana_Trench.html|title=Thirty Years of Discovering the Mariana Trench|last=Theberge|first=A.|date=24 March 2009|work=Hydro International|accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was one of the expedition&lt;!--which expedition, the British (he's "Sir" John) or the more recent US one?--&gt; scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.19thcenturyscience.org/HMSC/HMSC-Reports/1912-Murray/htm/doc131.html Page 131] of Murray's book refers to the Challenger Deep.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1951, about 75 years after its original discovery, the entire Mariana Trench was surveyed by a second [[Royal Navy]] vessel, captained by [[George Stephen Ritchie]] (later [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral]] Ritchie); this vessel was also named {{HMS|Challenger|1931|6}}, after the original expedition ship. This survey recorded the deepest part of the trench using [[echo sounding]], a more precise and easier way to measure depth than the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition.  A depth of {{convert|5960|fathom|0}} was measured at {{Coord|11|19|N|142|15|E}}.

*In 1998, a regional bathymetric survey of the Challenger Deep was conducted by the Deep Sea Research Vessel RV ''Kairei'', from the [[Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology]], using a SeaBeam 2112 multibeam echosounder. The regional bathymetric map made from the data obtained in 1998 shows that the greatest depths in the eastern, central, and western depressions are {{convert|10922|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|74|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|10898|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|62|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|10908|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|36|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, respectively, making the eastern depression the deepest of the three.&lt;ref name="Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep"/&gt;
*In 1999 and 2002, ''Kairei'' revisited the Challenger Deep. The cross track survey in the 1999 ''Kairei'' cruise shows that the greatest depths in the eastern, central, and western depressions are {{convert|10920|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|10894|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|14|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|10907|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|13|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, respectively, which supports the results of the 1998 survey. The detailed grid survey in 2002 showed that the deepest site is located in the eastern part of the eastern depression around {{Coord|11|22.260|N|142|35.589|E}}, with a depth of {{convert|10920|m|0|abbr=on}}  ±{{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, about {{convert|290|m|abbr=on}} southeast of the deepest site determined by the survey vessel ''Takuyo'' in 1984 and about {{convert|240|m|abbr=on}} east of the deepest place determined by the 1998 ''Kairei'' survey.&lt;ref name="Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep"/&gt;
*On 1 June 2009, sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Kongsberg Simrad EM 120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for deep water (300 – 11,000 metres) mapping aboard {{ship|RV|Kilo Moana}} (mothership of the underwater vehicle {{ship||Nereus|underwater vehicle|2}}) indicated a depth of {{convert|10971|m|0|abbr=on}}. The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, which is capable of an accuracy of 0.2% to 0.5% of water depth across the entire swath.&lt;ref name="Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientic Equipment aboard the R/V KILO MOANA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kongsberg-simrad.de/pdf/faecherlot_em120_eng_broch.pdf|title=kongsberg-simrad.de|author=|date=|website=www.kongsberg-simrad.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the multibeam bathymetry data of this sonar mapping have yet to be publicly released, so the data are not available for comparisons with other soundings.&lt;ref name="So, How Deep Is the Mariana Trench?"/&gt;
*On 7 October 2010, further sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep area was conducted by the US [[Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping]]/Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC) aboard {{USNS|Sumner|T-AGS-61|6}}. The results were reported in December 2011 at the annual [[American Geophysical Union]] fall meeting. Using a Kongsberg Maritime EM 122 [[multibeam echosounder]] system coupled to positioning equipment that can determine [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] up to {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} accuracy, from thousands of individual soundings around the deepest part the CCOM/JHC team preliminary determined that the Challenger Deep has a maximum depth of {{convert|10994|m|ft|abbr=on}} at {{Coord|11.326344|N|142.187248|E|scale:100000}}, with an estimated vertical uncertainty of ±{{convert|40|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at 2 [[standard deviation]]s (≈ 95.4%) confidence level.&lt;ref name=BBC_CCOM /&gt;  A secondary deep with a depth of {{convert|10951|m|ft|abbr=on}} was located at approximately {{convert|23.75|nmi|km|1|abbr=on}} to the east at {{Coord|11.369639|N|142.588582|E|scale:100000}} in the Mariana Trench.&lt;ref name="2011 cruise report"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.km.kongsberg.com/ks/web/nokbg0240.nsf/AllWeb/01FB0F22974EA50FC125715E002B2143?OpenDocument EM 122 Multibeam echosounder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.km.kongsberg.com/ks/web/nokbg0397.nsf/AllWeb/E016DF00EBFC2964C12571B1003F9DDA/$file/306105aa_em122ds_lr.pdf?OpenElement|title=EM 122 sonar multibeam bathymetry system brochure|author=|date=|website=kongsberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/pi/MB-System/formatdoc/EM_Datagram_Formats_RevP.pdf?OpenElement Instruction manual EM Series (EM 120 &amp; EM 122) Multibeam echo sounders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191111/http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/pi/MB-System/formatdoc/EM_Datagram_Formats_RevP.pdf?OpenElement |date=2 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a study was conducted regarding the determination of the depth and location of the Challenger Deep based on data collected previous to and during the 2010 sonar mapping of the Mariana Trench with a Kongsberg Maritime EM 122 multibeam echosounder system aboard USNS ''Sumner''. This study by James. V. Gardner et al. of the Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping-Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC), Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory of the University of New Hampshire splits the measurement attempt history into three main groups: early single-beam echo sounders (1950s-1970s), early multibeam echo sounders (1980s - 21st century), and modern (i.e., post-GPS, high-resolution) multibeam echo sounders. Taking uncertainties in depth measurements and position estimation into account the raw data of the 2010 bathymetry of the Challenger Deep vicinity consisting of 2,051,371 soundings from eight survey lines was analyzed. The study concludes that with the best of 2010 multibeam echosounder technologies after the analysis a depth uncertainty of ±{{convert|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (95% confidence level) on 9 degrees of freedom and a positional uncertainty of ±{{convert|20|to|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (2drms) remain and the location of the deepest depth recorded in the 2010 mapping is {{convert|10984|m|ft|abbr=on}} at {{Coord|11.329903|N|142.199305|E|scale:100000}}. The depth measurement uncertainty is a composite of measured uncertainties in the spatial variations in sound-speed through the water volume, the ray-tracing and bottom-detection algorithms of the multibeam system, the accuracies and calibration of the motion sensor and navigation systems, estimates of spherical spreading, attenuation throughout the water volume, and so forth.&lt;ref name="So, How Deep Is the Mariana Trench?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Gardner-et-al-2014-Challenger-Deep.pdf |title=So, How Deep Is the Mariana Trench? |date=5 March 2014 |publisher=Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping-Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC), Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory of the University of New Hampshire |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 and 2010 maximal depths were not confirmed by the series of dives ''Nereus'' made to the bottom during an expedition in May–June 2009. The direct descent measurements by the four expeditions which have reported from the bottom, have fixed depths in a narrow range from 10,916 m ({{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste||2}}) to 10,911 m ({{ship||Kaikō}}), to 10,902 m (''Nereus'') to 10,898 m ({{ship||Deepsea Challenger}}) Although an attempt was made to correlate locations, it could not be absolutely certain that ''Nereus'' (or the other descents) reached exactly the same points found to be maximally deep by the sonar/echo sounders of previous mapping expeditions, even though one of these echo soundings was made by ''Nereus''{{'}} mothership.

{{Main|Bathyscaphe Trieste}}
On 23 January 1960, the Swiss-designed [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|''Trieste'']], originally built in Italy and acquired by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], descended to the ocean floor in the trench manned by [[Jacques Piccard]] (who co-designed the submersible along with his father, [[Auguste Piccard]]) and USN Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]]. Their crew compartment was inside a spherical pressure vessel, which was a heavy-duty replacement (of the Italian original) built by [[Krupp]] Steel Works of [[Essen]], Germany. Their descent took almost five hours and the two men spent barely twenty minutes on the ocean floor before undertaking the three-hour-and-fifteen-minute ascent. Their early departure from the ocean floor was due to their concern over a crack in the outer window caused by the temperature differences during their descent.&lt;ref name="National Geographics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/1960-dive/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414093239/http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/1960-dive/ |archivedate=14 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The measured depth at the bottom was measured with a [[manometer]] at {{convert|10916|m|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep"/&gt;&lt;ref name=usn1960&gt;{{cite web

On 26 March 2012 (local time), Canadian film director [[James Cameron]] made a solo manned descent in the [[deep submergence vehicle|DSV]] ''Deepsea Challenger'' to the bottom of the Challenger Deep.&lt;ref name="NGS-20120325"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20120325"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC-20120325"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prince |first=Rosa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/guam/9166425/James-Cameron-becomes-first-solo-diver-to-visit-Earths-deepest-point.html |title=James Cameron becomes first solo diver to visit Earth's deepest point |publisher=The Telegraph |date=25 March 2012 |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At approximately 05:15 [[ChST]] on 26 March (19:15 UTC on 25 March), the descent began.&lt;ref name="James Cameron Begins Descent to Ocean's Deepest Point"&gt;{{cite web |author=National Geographic |title=James Cameron Begins Descent to Ocean's Deepest Point |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120325-james-cameron-mariana-trench-dive-deepest-science-sub-descent/ |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At 07:52 ChST (21:52 UTC), ''Deepsea Challenger'' arrived at the bottom.

During a post-dive press conference Cameron said: "I landed on a very soft, almost gelatinous flat plain. Once I got my bearings, I drove across it for quite a distance ... and finally worked my way up the slope." The whole time, Cameron said, he didn't see any fish, or any living creatures more than an inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm) long: "The only free swimmers I saw were small [[amphipods]]"—shrimplike bottom-feeders.&lt;ref name="James Cameron on Earth's Deepest Spot: Desolate, Lunar-Like"&gt;{{cite web |author=National Geographic |title=James Cameron on Earth's Deepest Spot: Desolate, Lunar-Like |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120326-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deepest-lunar-sub-science/ |date=27 March 2012 |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=27 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As small organisms with hard, calcareous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because of the high solubility of [[calcium carbonate]] in the pressurized water, scientists theorize that the preponderance of soft-shelled organisms in the Challenger Deep may have resulted from the typical [[biosphere]] present when the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the course of six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment died out or were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roach|first1=John|title=Life If Found Thriving at Ocean's Deepest Point|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0203_050203_deepest.html|website=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species that survived the change in depth were the ancestors of the Challenger Deep's current denizens.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}

'''Charles Marie de La Condamine''' (28 January 1701 – 4 February 1774) was a French [[explorer]], [[geographer]], and [[mathematician]]. He spent ten years in present-day [[Ecuador]] measuring the length of a degree latitude at the [[equator]] and preparing the first map of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] region based on astronomical observations. Furthermore he was a contributor to the [[Encyclopédie|Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1989_num_7_1_1036 Frank A.

==Biography==
Charles Marie de La Condamine was born in [[Paris]] as a son of well-to-do parents, Charles de La Condamine and Louise Marguerite Chourses. He studied at the [[Collège Louis-le-Grand]] where he was trained in humanities as well as in mathematics.  After finishing his studies, he enlisted in the army and fought in the war against Spain (1719).  After returning from the war, he became acquainted with scientific circles in Paris.  On 12 December 1730 he became a member of the [[Académie des Sciences]] and was appointed Assistant Chemist at the Academy.

The next year (May 1731) he sailed with the [[Levant Company]] to [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]), where he stayed five months. After returning to Paris, La Condamine submitted in November 1732 a paper to the Academy entitled ''Mathematical and Physical Observations made during a Visit of the Levant in 1731 and 1732''.

Three years later he joined the [[French Geodesic Mission]] to present-day Ecuador which had the aim of testing a hypothesis of [[Isaac Newton]]. Newton had posited that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but bulges around the equator and is flattened  at the poles. Newton's opinion had raised a huge controversy among French scientists. [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]], [[Alexis Claude Clairaut]], and [[Pierre Charles Le Monnier]] traveled to Lapland, where they were to measure the length of several degrees of latitude orthogonal to the arctic circle, while [[Louis Godin]], [[Pierre Bouguer]], and La Condamine were sent to South America to perform similar measurements around the [[equator]].

On 16 May 1735, La Condamine sailed from [[La Rochelle]] accompanied by Godin, Bouguer, and a botanist, [[Joseph de Jussieu]].  After stopovers in [[Martinique]], [[Saint-Domingue]], and [[Cartagena (Colombia)]], they came to Panama where they crossed the continent. Finally (on 10 March 1736) the expedition arrived at the Pacific port of [[Manta, Ecuador|Manta]].  La Condamine's associations with his colleagues were unhappy. The expedition was beset by many difficulties, and finally La Condamine split from the rest and made his way to [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]] separately following the [[Esmeraldas River]], becoming the first European to encounter [[rubber]] in the process. He joined the group again on 4 June 1736 in the city of [[Quito]]. La Condamine is credited with introducing samples of rubber to the ''[[Académie Royale des Sciences]]'' of France in 1736.&lt;ref name=bouncingballs&gt;http://www.bouncing-balls.com/timeline/people/nr_condamine.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1751, he presented a paper by [[François Fresneau]] to the Académie (eventually published in 1755) which described many of the properties of rubber. This has been referred to as the first scientific paper on rubber.

The [[meridian arc|meridian (longitudinal) arc]] which La Condamine and his colleagues chose to measure the length of passed through a high valley perpendicular to the equator, stretching from Quito (now the capital of Ecuador) in the north to [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]] in the south.  The scientists spent a month performing triangulation measurements in the Yaruqui plains — from 3 October to 3 November 1736 — and then returned to Quito. After they had come back to Quito, they found that subsidies expected from Paris had not arrived. La Condamine, who had taken precautions and had made a deposit on a bank in [[Lima]], traveled in early 1737 to Lima to collect money. He prolonged this journey somewhat to study the [[Cinchona|cinchona tree]] with its medicinally active bark (containing the anti-malarial drug [[quinine]]), the tree being hardly known in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;de la Condamine (1738) [https://books.google.com/books?id=yOAEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Sur l'arbre du quinquina"] (On the quinquina tree) ''Histoire de l'Académie royale des Sciences'', pages 226-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to Quito on 20 June 1737, he found that Godin refused to disclose his results, whereupon La Condamine joined forces with Bouguer.  The two men continued with their length measurements in the mountainous and inaccessible region close to Quito.  When in December 1741 Bouguer detected an error in a calculation of La Condamine's, the two explorers got into a quarrel and stopped speaking to each other.  However, working separately, the two completed their project in May 1743.
[[File:Carmontelle, Monsieur de la Condamine (1760, détail).jpg|thumb|left|La Condamine (Carmontelle 1760)]]
Insufficient funds prevented La Condamine from returning to France directly. Thus La Condamine chose to return by way of the [[Amazon River]], a route which is longer and more dangerous. His was the first scientific exploration of the Amazon. He reached the Atlantic Ocean on 19 September 1743, having made  observations of astronomic and topographic interest on the way.  He also made some botanical studies, notably of cinchona and rubber trees. In February 1744 he arrived in [[Cayenne]], the capital of [[French Guiana]]. He did not dare to travel back to France on a French merchant ship because France was at war (the [[War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian Succession War]] of 1740&amp;ndash;1748), and he had to wait for five months for a Dutch ship, but made good use of his waiting time by observing and recording physical, biological, and ethnological phenomena.  Finally leaving Cayenne in August 1744, he arrived in [[Amsterdam]] on 30 November 1744, where he stayed for a while, and arrived in Paris in February 1745. He brought with him many notes, natural history specimens, and art objects that he donated to the naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] (1707–1788).

[[File:Houghton LSoc 1621.3.10 - La Condamine, title.jpg|thumb|''Journal du voyage fait par ordre du roi, a l'équateur'', 1751]]
La Condamine published the results of his measurements and travels with a map of the Amazon in ''Mém. de l'Académie des Sciences'', 1745 (English translation 1745–1747). This included the first descriptions by a European of the [[Casiquiare canal]] and the [[curare]] arrow poison prepared by the [[Amerindian]]s. He also noted the correct use of [[quinine]] to fight [[malaria]]. The journal of his ten-year-long voyage to South America was published in Paris in 1751. The scientific results of the expedition were unambiguous: the Earth is indeed a spheroid flattened at the poles as was believed by Newton. Not surprisingly, La Condamine and Bouguer failed to write a joint publication. Bouguer's death in 1758 put an end to their quarrel. The other expedition member, Godin, died in 1760.  The only surviving member, La Condamine, obtained most of the credit for the expedition which drew a great deal of attention in France, as he was a gifted writer and popularizer.

On a visit to Rome La Condamine made careful measurements of the ancient buildings with a view to a precise determination of the length of the [[Roman empire|Roman]] foot. He also wrote in favour of [[inoculation]], and on various other subjects, mainly connected with his work in South America.

La Condamine had contracted smallpox in his youth.  This led him to take part in the debate on vaccination against the disease and to propagate inoculation against small-pox. Assisted by the clarity and elegance of his writing, he presented several papers at the Academy of Sciences in which he defended his ideas with passion. He became a corresponding member of the academies of [[London]], [[Berlin]], [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Bologna]], and was elected to the l'[[Académie française]] on 29 November 1760.  In August 1756, he married, with papal dispensation, his young niece Charlotte Bouzier of Estouilly.  La Condamine had many friends, the closest one being Maupertuis, to whom he bequeathed his papers. La Condamine died in Paris on 4 February 1774, following a hernia operation.

A '''Communist state''' (sometimes referred to as '''[[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] state''' or '''workers' state''') is a [[State (polity)|state]] that is administered and governed by a [[One-party state|single party]], guided by Marxist-Leninist philosophy, with the aim of achieving [[communism]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Communist states are typically administered by a single, [[Democratic centralism|centralised party apparatus]], although some provide the impression of multiple political parties but these are all solely in control by that centralised party. These parties usually are Marxist–Leninist or some variation thereof (including [[Maoism]] in [[China]]), with the official aim of achieving socialism and progressing toward a [[communist society]]. These states are usually termed by [[Marxism|Marxists]] as [[dictatorship of the proletariat|dictatorships of the proletariat]], or dictatorships of the [[working class]], whereby the working class is the [[ruling class]] of the country in contrast to [[capitalism]], whereby the [[bourgeoisie]] is the ruling class.

== Communist party as the leader of the state ==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
In the [[Marxism|theories]] of [[German philosophy|German philosopher]] [[Karl Marx]], a state in any society is an instrument of oppression by one [[social class]] over another, historically a minority exploiter class ruling over a majority exploited class. Marx saw that in his contemporary time the new [[nation state]]s were characterized by increasingly intensified class contradiction between the [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist class]] and the [[Proletariat|working class]] it ruled over. He predicted that if the class contradictions of the capitalist system continue to intensify, that the working class will ultimately become [[Class consciousness|conscious]] of itself as an exploited collective and will overthrow the capitalists and establish collective ownership over the [[means of production]], therein arriving at a [[Post-capitalism|new phase of development]] called [[Socialist mode of production|socialism (in Marxist understanding)]]. 

The state ruled by the working class during the transition into classless society is called the "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]". [[Vladimir Lenin]] created [[Vanguardism|revolutionary vanguard]] theory in an attempt to expand on the concept. Lenin saw that science is something that is initially practicable by only a minority of society who happen to be in a position free from distraction so that they may contemplate it and believed that [[scientific socialism]] was no exception. He therefore advocated that the [[Communist party]] should be structured as a vanguard of those who have achieved full class consciousness to be at the forefront of the [[Class conflict|class struggle]] and lead the workers to expand class consciousness and replace the capitalist class as the ruling class, therein establishing the proletarian state.

== Development of Communist states ==
{{History of Communist Nations}}
During the 20th century, the world's first constitutionally socialist state was in Russia in 1917. In 1922, it [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|joined]] other former territories of the [[Russian Empire|empire]] to become the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR). After [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Army]] occupied much of Eastern Europe and thus helped establish Communist states in these countries. Most Communist states in Eastern Europe were [[Warsaw Pact|allied]] with the Soviet Union, except for [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] which declared itself [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]]. In 1949, after a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war against Japanese occupation]] and a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] resulting in a [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] victory, the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) was established. Communist states were also established in [[Cambodia]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]]. A Communist state was established in [[North Korea]], although it later adopted its own ideology called [[Juche]]. In 1989, the Communist states in Eastern Europe collapsed under public pressure during a [[Revolutions of 1989|wave of non-violent movements]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Today, the existing Communist states in the world are in China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam.

These Communist states often do not claim to have achieved socialism or communism in their countries—rather, they claim to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam's Constitution]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was re-unified under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] in 1976&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ "VN Embassy - Constitution of 1992"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From the Preamble: "On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty".&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]] is to "guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm "Cubanet - Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709122434/http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From Article 5: "The Communist Party of Cuba, a follower of Martí’s ideas and of Marxism-Leninism, and the organized vanguard of the Cuban nation, is the highest leading force of society and of the state, which organizes and guides the common effort toward the goals of the construction of socialism and the progress toward a communist society".&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist states share similar institutions, which are organized on the premise that the [[Communist party]] is a [[Vanguardism|vanguard of the proletariat]] and represents the long-term interests of the people. The doctrine of [[democratic centralism]], which was developed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as a set of principles to be used in the internal affairs of the Communist party, is extended to society at large.&lt;ref name="Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8–9"&gt;Furtak, Robert K. ''The political systems of the socialist states'', St. Martin's Press, New York, 1986, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to democratic centralism, all leaders must be elected by the people and all proposals must be debated openly, but once a decision has been reached all people have a duty to obey that decision and all debate should end. When used within a political party, democratic centralism is meant to prevent factionalism and splits. When applied to an entire state, democratic centralism creates a [[One-party state|one-party system]].&lt;ref name="Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8–9"/&gt;

The constitutions of most Communist states describe their political system as a form of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Furtak, Robert K. ''The political systems of the socialist states'', St. Martin's Press, New York, 1986, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; They thus recognize the sovereignty of the people as embodied in a series of [[Representative democracy|representative]] parliamentary institutions. Such states do not have a [[separation of powers]] and instead have one national legislative body (such as the [[Supreme Soviet]] in the [[Soviet Union]]) which is considered the highest organ of state power and which is legally superior to the executive and judicial branches of government.&lt;ref&gt;Furtak, Robert K. ''The political systems of the socialist states'', St. Martin's Press, New York, 1987, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such national legislative politics in Communist states often have a similar structure to the parliaments that exist in [[Liberal democracy|liberal republics]], with two significant differences: first, the deputies elected to these national legislative bodies are not expected to represent the interests of any particular constituency, but the long-term interests of the people as a whole; and second, against Marx's advice, the legislative bodies of Communist states are not in permanent session. Rather, they convene once or several times per year in sessions which usually last only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;Furtak, Robert K. ''The political systems of the socialist states'', St. Martin's Press, New York, 1986, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the national legislative body is not in session, its powers are transferred to a smaller council (often called a [[presidium]]) which combines legislative and executive power and in some Communist states (such as the Soviet Union before 1990), acts as a collective [[head of state]]. In some systems, the presidium is composed of important Communist party members who vote the resolutions of the Communist party into law.

=== State social institutions ===
A feature of Communist states is the existence of numerous state-sponsored social organizations ([[trade union]]s, [[youth organization]]s, [[women's organization]]s, [[Club (organization)|associations]] of teachers, writers, journalists and other professionals, [[consumer cooperatives]], [[sports club]]s and so on) which are integrated into the political system.

In Communist states, the social organizations are expected to promote social unity and cohesion, to serve as a link between the government and society and to provide a forum for recruitment of new Communist party members.&lt;ref&gt;Furtak, Robert K. ''The political systems of the socialist states'', St. Martin's Press, New York, 1986, p. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political power ===
Historically, the political organization of many socialist states has been dominated by a one-party monopoly. Some Communist governments, such as [[North Korea]], [[East Germany]] or [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], have or had more than one political party, but all minor parties are or were required to follow the leadership of the Communist party. In Communist states, the government may not tolerate criticism of policies that have already been implemented in the past or are being implemented in the present.&lt;ref&gt;Furtak, Robert K. ''The political systems of the socialist states'', St. Martin's Press, New York, 1986, p. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Communist parties have won elections and governed in the context of [[Multi-party system|multi-party democracies]] without seeking to establish a one-party state and therefore these entities do not fall under the definition of Communist state. Examples include [[San Marino]], [[Nicaragua]] (1979–1990),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/15/world/nicaragua-s-communist-party-shifts-to-opposition.html|work=The New York Times|first=Stephen|last=Kinzer|title=NICARAGUA'S COMMUNIST PARTY SHIFTS TO OPPOSITION|date=15 January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moldova]], [[Nepal]] (presently), [[Cyprus]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/25/cyprus.greece "Cyprus elects its first communist president"], ''The Guardian'', 25 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Indian states of [[Kerala]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyberjournalist.info/kerala/sumas.php4?year=2006 Kerala Assembly Elections-- 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{main article|Criticisms of communist party rule}}
Countries such as the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] were criticized by Western authors and organisations on the basis of a lack of [[multi-party]] [[Western democracy]],&lt;ref name="Basic Books AZ"&gt;{{cite book|last1=SP|first1=Huntington|title=Authoritarian politics in modern society: the dynamics of established one-party systems|date=1970|publisher=Basic Books (AZ)|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowy|first1=Michael|title=Mass organization, party, and state: Democracy in the transition to socialism|journal=Transition and Development: Problems of Third World Socialism|date=1986|issue=94|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to several other areas where socialist society and [[Western society|Western societies]] differed. For instance, socialist societies were commonly characterised by [[state ownership]] or [[social ownership]] of the [[means of production]] either through [[management|administration]] through [[Communist Party|party]] organisations, democratically elected [[councils]] and [[communes]] and [[co-operative|co-operative structures]]—in opposition to the [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[free market]] paradigm of management, ownership and control by corporations and private individuals.&lt;ref name="University of Chicago Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amandae|first1=Sonja|title=Rationalizing capitalist democracy: The cold war origins of rational choice liberalism|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communist states have also been criticised for the [[Social influence|influence]] and outreach of their respective [[ruling party|ruling parties]] on [[society]], in addition to lack of recognition for some Western [[legal rights]] and [[Civil liberty|liberties]] &lt;ref name=coe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta06/Eres1481.htm|title=Assemblée parlementaire du Conseil de l'Europe|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the right to ownership of private property and the restriction of the [[Free speech|right to free speech]].

Soviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of "freedom". McFarland and Ageyev noted that "Marxist–Leninist norms disparaged ''laissez-faire'' individualism (as when housing is determined by one's ability to pay), also [condemning] wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not. Instead, Soviet ideals emphasized equality—free education and medical care, little disparity in housing or salaries, and so forth".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McFarland|first1=Sam|last2=Ageyev|first2=Vladimir|last3=Abalakina-Paap|first3=Marina|title=Authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1992|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.1004}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to comment on the claim that former citizens of Communist states enjoy increased freedoms, [[Heinz Kessler]], former [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)|East German Minister of National Defence]], replied: "Millions of people in Eastern Europe are now free from employment, free from safe streets, free from health care, free from social security".&lt;ref name="City Lights Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parenti|first1=Michael|title=Blackshirts and reds : rational fascism and the overthrow of communism|date=1997|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87286-330-1|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early economic development policies of Communist states have been criticised for focusing primarily on the development of [[heavy industry]].

In his critique of states run under Marxist–Leninist ideology, economist [[Michael Ellman]] of the [[University of Amsterdam]] notes that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy.&lt;ref name=ellman&gt;[[Michael Ellman]].

== Multi-party states with governing Communist parties ==
There are multi-party states with Communist parties leading the government. Such states are not considered to be Communist states as the countries themselves allow for multiple parties and do not provide a constitutional role for their Communist parties.
* {{flag|Nepal|name=Nepal}}: the [[Nepal Communist Party]] is the current ruling party of the central government.
* {{flag|India|name=India}}: the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] is the leading party in the state government in the southern state of [[Kerala]].
* {{flag|Brazil|name=Brazil}}: the [[Communist Party of Brazil]] is the leading party in the state government in the northern state of [[Maranhão]].
* {{flag|Russia|name=Russia}}: the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] is the leading party in the regional governments of the [[Irkutsk Oblast]] and the [[Oryol Oblast]].

[[San Marino]] (1945–1957), [[Moldova]] (2001–2009), [[Cyprus]] (2001–2013) and [[Guyana]] (1992–2015) have also had officially Marxist–Leninist ruling parties.

[[File:Czech Rep. - Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia III (en).png|thumb|right|360px|Czech historical lands and current administrative regions (''[[kraj]]e'')]]
The '''Czech lands''' or the '''Bohemian lands'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brill.com/products/book/history-jews-bohemian-lands Martin Wein: History of the Jews in the Bohemian Lands]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mua.cas.cz/cs/foto/mezinarodni-konference-between-politics-and-culture-new-perspectives-on-the-history-of-the-bohemian-lands-and-the-first-150 Between Politics and Culture: New Perspectives on the History of the Bohemian Lands and the First Czechoslovak Republic (1880s–1930s)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://bookstore.artmap.cz/cs/2666-biedermeier-umeni-akultura-vceskych-zemich-1814-1848-2vydani Biedermeier. Art and Culture in the Bohemian Lands 1814–1848]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-cs|České země}}) are the three [[historical region]]s of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Czech Silesia]]. Together the three have formed the Czech part of [[Czechoslovakia]] since 1918 and the [[Czech Republic]] since 1 January 1969, which became independent on 1 January 1993.

In a historical context, Czech texts use the term to refer to any territory ruled by the [[List of rulers of Bohemia|Kings of Bohemia]], i.e., the [[lands of the Bohemian Crown]] (''{{lang|cs|země Koruny české}}'') as established by Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in the 14th century. This would include territories like the [[Lusatia]]s (which in 1635 fell to [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]]) and the whole of [[Silesia]], all ruled from [[Prague Castle]] at that time. After the conquest of Silesia by the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] king [[Frederick the Great]] in 1742, the remaining lands of the Bohemian Crown—Bohemia, Moravia and [[Austrian Silesia]]—have been more or less co-extensive with the territory of the modern-day Czech Republic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

== Alternative names ==
{{main|Name of the Czech Republic}}
The term Czech lands has been used to describe different things by different people. While the Czech name of Bohemia proper is ''Čechy'', the adjective ''český'' refers to both "Bohemian" and "Czech". The non-auxiliary term (i.e. the term used in official Czech geographical terminology lists) for the present-day Czech lands (i.e. Bohemia, Moravia, Czech Silesia) is ''Česko'', documented as early as in 1704.

During the period of the First and Second Czechoslovak Republic the Czech lands were frequently referred as ''Historical lands'' in particular when mentioned together with [[Slovakia]] (which was never an autonomous historical region within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]).

==History==
{{main|History of the Czech lands}}
The Bohemian lands had been settled by Celts ([[Boii]]) from 5th BC until 2nd AD, then by various Germanic tribes ([[Marcomanni]], [[Quadi]], [[Lombards]] and others) until they moved on to the west during the [[Migration Period]] (1st-5th century). At the beginning of the 5th century the population decreased vigorously and, according to [[Slavic mythology|mythology]] led by a chieftain ''Čech'', the first [[Western Slavs]] came in the second half of the 6th century. In the course of the decline of the [[Great Moravia]]n realm during the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]] in the 9th and 10th century, the Czech [[Přemyslid dynasty]] established the [[Duchy of Bohemia]]. Backed by the [[East Francia|East Frankish]] kings, they prevailed against the reluctant Bohemian nobility and extended their rule eastwards over the adjacent [[Moravia]]n lands.

In 1198 Duke [[Ottokar I of Bohemia]] received the royal title by the [[Kingdom of Germany|German]] [[anti-king]] [[Philip of Swabia]]. Attached to his [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was the [[Margraviate of Moravia]] established in 1182 and [[Kłodzko Land]], the later [[County of Kladsko]]. From the second part of the 13th century onwards, [[Ethnic Germans|German colonists]] ("[[Sudeten Germans|German Bohemians]]") settled in the mountainous border area on the basis of the kings' invitation during the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'' (in [[Prague]] they lived already from the early 12th century) and lived alongside the Slavs.

The Silesian lands north of the [[Sudetes]] mountain range had been ruled by the Polish [[Piast dynasty]] from the 10th century onwards. While Bohemia rose to a kingdom, the [[Silesian Piasts]] alienated from the fragmenting [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Kingdom of Poland]]. After in 1310 the Bohemian crown had passed to the mighty [[House of Luxembourg]], nearly all [[Duchies of Silesia|Silesian dukes]] pledged allegiance to King [[John of Bohemia|John the Blind]] and in 1335 the Polish king [[Casimir III the Great]] officially renounced Silesia by the [[Treaty of Trentschin]]. King John had also acquired the lands of [[Bautzen]] and [[Görlitz]] (later [[Upper Lusatia]]) in 1319 and 1329. His son and successor Charles IV, also [[King of the Romans]] since 1346, incorporated the Silesian and Lusatian estates into the Bohemian Crown and upon his coronation as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] confirmed their indivisibility and affiliation with the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

In 1367 Emperor Charles IV also purchased the former [[March of Lusatia]] ([[Lower Lusatia]]) in the northwest, however,  during the [[Thirty Years' War]] both Lusatias passed to the Electorate of Saxony by the [[Peace of Prague (1635)|Peace of Prague]]. After the Bohemian Crown ([[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]]) passed to the [[House of Habsburg]] in 1526, the Bohemian [[crown lands]] together with the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] "hereditary lands" became part of the larger [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In 1742 the Habsburg queen [[Maria Theresa]] lost the bulk of Silesia to Prussia upon the [[Silesian Wars|First Silesian War]], part of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].

==Coats of arms==
{{main|Coat of arms of the Czech Republic}} The coat of arms of the Czech Republic incorporates those of the three integral Czech lands: Bohemia proper, Moravia and Czech Silesia. The arms of Bohemia originated with the Bohemian kingdom, like those of Moravia with the Moravian margraviate. The arms of Czech Silesia originated as those of all of the historical region of Silesia, much of which is now in [[Poland]].

'''Dibeen Forest Reserve''' is a [[List of nature reserves in Jordan|nature reserve]] located in the north-west of [[Jordan]]. It is situated just south of the Roman site of [[Jerash]]&lt;ref name=eco&gt;{{cite book|title=Jordan Eco &amp; Nature|publisher=Jordan Tourism Board, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and covers an area of {{convert|8.5|km2|sqmi|1}}&lt;ref name=rscn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rscn.org.jo/orgsite/RSCN/HelpingNature/ProtectedAreas/DibeenForestReserve/tabid/97/Default.aspx|title=Dibeen Forest Reserve|publisher=Jordan Society for the Conservation of Nature|accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; of rolling hills covered with [[pine]]–[[oak]] habitat. This area houses the largest Aleppo Pines one of the oldest and naturally grown habitats in Jordan. It also is the home to 17 endangered species such as the [[Persian Squirrel]].

The area was protected as a nature reserve in 2004 under the initiative of the [[Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature]].&lt;ref name="rscn" /&gt;

== Geology and climate ==
The forest is known as the driest places in the region and ranges over 60&amp;nbsp;km and is changing in altitude of 500m to 1000m above sea level. The rock within the reserve is a mixture of [[limestone]] and chalky limestone, which has been formed into steep slopes.&lt;ref name=rscn /&gt; The average rainfall is {{convert|710|mm|in|0}} per year.&lt;ref name=rscn /&gt; Within the forest, there is a variety of moisture conditions, with [[wadis]] giving different regimes from those found on the steep slopes.

== The Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) ==
The [[Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature]] (RSCN) is a voluntary organization that works to preserve the natural resources of [[Jordan]]. It was established in 1966 under the patronage of [[Queen Noor of Jordan|Queen Noor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r and the late [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] as Honorary President.

In 1966 their main focus was the decline in animal species due to illegal hunting in the area and the disregard to nature in Jordan. The small group of pioneers worked side by side with the government to make sure that wildlife was kept safe by creating ground rules and hunting laws. As a result, in 1973, the RSCN was given the right to issue hunting licenses and develop hunting patrols to regulate hunting laws in Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rscn.org.jo/content/full-story|title=The Full Story {{!}} RSCN|website=www.rscn.org.jo|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work flourished and by 1995 they were the first to establish the first Jordanian Environmental Protection Law&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moenv.gov.jo/En/LegislationAndPolicies/Legislation/Regulations/Pages/EnvironmentalProtectionLaw.aspx#|title=Environmental Protection Law No. 52 of 2006|website=www.moenv.gov.jo|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Environmental Police Unit in 2006.

Throughout the years the RSNC has dutifully protected six areas around Jordan (1200 square meters). These areas include [[Shaumari Wildlife Reserve|Shaumari]], [[Azraq, Jordan|Azraq,]] [[Dana, Jordan|Dana]], [[Wadi Mujib]], [[Ajloun]], and [[Dibeen Forest Reserve|Dibeen]].

On May 17, 2016, [[The Jordan Times]] wrote an article on the RSCN's celebration of its golden jubilee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/rscn-celebrates-golden-jubilee-releases-annual-report|title=RSCN celebrates golden jubilee, releases annual report|date=2016-05-17|newspaper=Jordan Times|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flora ==
[[Image:Dibeen Trees.jpg|thumb|left]]The forest reserve contains one of the last remaining examples of a pine–oak forest in the [[Middle East]]. The species of the reserve's trees vary with elevation; [[Aleppo Pine]]s inhabit the lower altitudes, the mixed pine–oak woodland (comprising Aleppo Pine and [[Palestine Oak]]) grows in the middle, and a species of small deciduous oak – [[Quercus infectoria]] (the Aleppo, or Cyprus, Oak) – grows at the higher altitudes.&lt;ref name=rscn /&gt; Other flora in the habitat include [[orchids]], [[Arbutus andrachne|Greek strawberry trees]], [[pistachio]], and [[olive tree]]s. The forest's age structure shows wide variation, with many areas containing mature forest trees and a vigorous [[understory]].

== Fauna ==
At least 17 endangered species have been identified within the reserve. These include the Persian [[red squirrel]], four [[bat]] types,&lt;ref name=eco /&gt; [[grey wolves]] and striped [[hyenas]]. Woodland [[List of birds of Jordan|birds]] also live in the forest.&lt;ref name=eco /&gt; It is also believed but not proven, that this reserve has the last population of Southern Banded Newts living in Jordan

== Conservation ==
Dibeen Forest Reserve was established in 2004 after being listed as a conservation priority in the 1998 protected areas review and the 8.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area became part of the protected area.&lt;ref name=rscn /&gt;

Between 2004 and 2007, [[UNDP]] led a project in the Dibeen Forest, Jerash, Al Meirad and Burma municipalities of the region to support the establishment of the nature reserve. This helped to conserve the unique local [[biodiversity]] and encouraged the local communities to make sustainable alternative uses of the available resources. As a result, there was increased awareness of the local capacity-building and need for the conservation-oriented land use planning in the region.&lt;ref&gt;UNDP (2003) [http://www.energyandenvironment.undp.org/index.cfm?module=Projects&amp;page=Project&amp;ProjID=753 Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity in Dibeen Nature Reserve]. Jordan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite efforts to protect the forest, it is gradually and systematically being destroyed by the establishment of modern cement projects, intentional fires, over grazing and illegal sporadic logging.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The '''Eger Graben''' ({{lang-cs|Oherský příkop}}, {{lang-de|Egergraben}}), much less commonly called the Ohre or Ohře Graben, is a geographical unit in the [[Czech Republic]]. It runs southwards, parallel to the [[Ore Mountains]] (''Krušné Hory'') and its formation is linked with that of the mountain range.

== Topography ==
The [[Ohře]] (equally commonly known in English by its German name ''Eger'', hence the name of the trough) flows through the Eger [[Graben]] and separates the Ore Mountains from the [[Slavkovský les]] and the [[Doupov Mountains]]. The trench continues to the northeast along the valley of the [[Bílina (river)|Bílina]] and later, as the [[North Bohemian Basin]], separates the Ore Mountains from the [[Bohemian Central Mountains]], where the River Ohře leaves the graben and flows into the Elbe south of the Bohemian Mountains.

== Geology ==
The Eger Graben is part of the [[European Cenozoic Rift System]] and was created geologically on the same principle as the [[Rhine Rift Valley]]. It was formed by the almost complete erosion of the [[Variscan orogeny|Variscan Mountains]] and sits on a [[fault-block]] caused by the horizontal pressure of the [[Africa]]n continental plate. This block dropped, however, in contrast to the surrounding area. The Ore Mountains are [[fault-block mountains]] which rise very gently in Germany, but drop very steeply into the Eger Graben. The trench thus follows the main fault line of the Ore Mountains.

The worldwide [[floriculture]] industry is worth well over 30 billion U.S dollars and demand, as well as production, is on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, N.S.P. (1998). Floriculture worldwide trade and consumption patterns. World conference of Horticultural Research, Actahort.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Canada is not one of the major floriculture producers worldwide, this industry remains of importance to the nation.

==Introduction==
In 2001, the Canadian floriculture industry was valued at $904 million CAD.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M.M. (2001). "[http://www.actahort.org/books/543/543_1.htm Floriculture industry overview: production, sales and marketing in North America]". ''Acta Hort.'' (ISHS) 543:23-29&lt;/ref&gt; To give a more recent figure, Canadian floricultural farm cash receipts in 2013 totalled $1.09 billion CAD.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada (2014). "[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/agri03a-eng.htm Farm cash receipts 2013]". Accessed November 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, there were 2,278 floricultural farms in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada (2014). [http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/pick-choisir?lang=eng&amp;p2=33&amp;id=0040014 Census of Agriculture], farms classified by the North American industry classification. Accessed November 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the provinces, Ontario has the greatest share in this industry—nearly 45% in 2004.&lt;ref name="reid"&gt;Reid, N., &amp; Carroll, M. (2005). "Using Cluster-Based Economic Development to Enhance the Economic Competitiveness of Northwest Ohio's Greenhouse Nursery Industry". In ''Papers and Proceedings of Applied Geography Conferences'' (Vol. 28, p. 309). [np]; 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly Ontario dominates in exports to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, N., Smith, B. W., Gatrell, J. D., &amp; Carroll, M. C. (2009). "Importing Change: Canadian Competition and the US Floriculture Industry". ''The Industrial Geographer'', 6(1), 3-19.&lt;/ref&gt; 9,500 people of mainly Dutch and Danish background were employed by Ontario’s floriculture industry in 2004.&lt;ref name="reid" /&gt; Southern Ontario’s strategic location within 12 hours by road of half of the U.S. urban population is cited as one of the major sources of its success in floriculture.&lt;ref name="reid" /&gt; Clearly the floriculture industry is quite important to Canada and especially to Ontario.

[[File:Parterre2.jpg|thumb|275px|Part of a [[parterre]] in an [[English garden]]]]
'''Gardening''' is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of [[horticulture]]. In gardens, [[ornamental plant]]s are often grown for their [[flower]]s, [[leaf|foliage]], or overall appearance; useful plants, such as [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]], [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, and [[herb]]s, are grown for consumption, for use as [[dye]]s, or for [[Medicine|medicinal]] or [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] use. Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.

Gardening ranges in scale from [[fruit]] [[orchard]]s, to long [[boulevard]] plantings with one or more different types of [[shrub]]s, [[tree]]s, and [[herbaceous plant]]s, to residential [[Yard (land)|yards]] including lawns and foundation plantings, to plants in large or small containers grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a large number of different plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from [[Agriculture|farming]] or [[forestry]].

==History==
{{Main|History of gardening}}
[[Image:Forestgarden2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Robert Hart (horticulturist)|Robert Hart]]'s forest garden in [[Shropshire]], England]]

===Ancient times===
[[Forest gardening]], a forest-based food production system, is the world's oldest form of gardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage|isbn=9780754609582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest gardens originated in [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]] along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of [[monsoon]] regions. In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while undesirable species were eliminated. Eventually foreign species were also selected and incorporated into the gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The forest-garden farms of Kandy, Sri Lanka|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=1992|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3QPo7lThXsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage|isbn=9789251028988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the emergence of the first [[civilization]]s, wealthy individuals began to create gardens for aesthetic purposes. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian tomb paintings from the [[New Kingdom]] (around 1500 BC) provide some of the earliest physical evidence of ornamental [[horticulture]] and landscape design; they depict [[Egyptian lotus|lotus]] ponds surrounded by symmetrical rows of [[acacia]]s and [[palm tree|palms]]. A notable example of ancient [[Ornamental Gardens|ornamental gardens]] were the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]]—one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] —while [[ancient Rome]] had dozens of gardens.

Wealthy ancient Egyptians used gardens for providing shade. Egyptians associated trees and gardens with gods, believing that their deities were pleased by gardens. Gardens in ancient Egypt were often surrounded by walls with trees planted in rows. Among the most popular species planted were [[date palms]], sycamores, [[Ficus|fir trees]], nut trees, and [[willows]]. These gardens were a sign of higher socioeconomic status. In addition, wealthy ancient Egyptians grew vineyards, as wine was a sign of the higher social classes. [[Rose]]s, poppies, [[Asteraceae|daisies]] and [[Iris (plant)|irises]] could all also be found in the gardens of the Egyptians.

[[Assyria]] was also renowned for its beautiful gardens. These tended to be wide and large, some of them used for hunting game—rather like a game reserve today—and others as leisure gardens. [[Cupressus|Cypresses]] and palms were some of the most frequently planted types of trees.

[[Ancient Roman]] gardens were laid out with hedges and vines and contained a wide variety of flowers—[[Acanthus (plant)|acanthus]], [[cornflowers]], [[crocus]], [[cyclamen]], hyacinth, iris, ivy, [[lavender]], lilies, myrtle, narcissus, poppy, [[rosemary]] and violets&lt;ref name="localhistories"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/gardening.html| title=A Brief History of Gardening|accessdate= 2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;—as well as statues and sculptures. Flower beds were popular in the courtyards of rich Romans.
[[File:Mendel II 073 v.jpg|thumb|170px|A gardener at work, 1607]]

===The Middle Ages===
The [[Middle Age]] represented a period of decline in gardens for aesthetic purposes, with regard to gardening. After the fall of Rome, gardening was done for the purpose of growing [[medicinal herbs]] and/or decorating church [[altars]]. Monasteries carried on a tradition of garden design and intense horticultural techniques during the medieval period in Europe. 
Generally, monastic garden types consisted of kitchen gardens, infirmary gardens, cemetery orchards, cloister garths and vineyards. Individual monasteries might also have had a "green court", a plot of grass and trees where horses could graze, as well as a cellarer's garden or private gardens for obedientiaries, monks who held specific posts within the monastery.

[[Islamic Gardens|Islamic gardens]] were built after the model of Persian gardens and they were usually enclosed by walls and divided in 4 by watercourses. Commonly, the center of the garden would have a pool or [[pavilion]]. Specific to the Islamic gardens are the [[mosaics]] and glazed tiles used to decorate the rills and [[Fountain|fountains]] that were built in these gardens.

By the late 13th century, rich Europeans began to grow gardens for leisure and for medicinal herbs and vegetables.&lt;ref name="localhistories" /&gt; They surrounded the gardens by walls to protect them from animals and to provide [[seclusion]]. During the next two centuries, Europeans started planting lawns and raising flowerbeds and trellises of roses. Fruit trees were common in these gardens and also in some, there were turf seats. At the same time, the gardens in the [[monasteries]] were a place to grow flowers and medicinal herbs but they were also a space where the [[monks]] could enjoy nature and relax.

The gardens in the 16th and 17th century were [[symmetric]], proportioned and balanced with a more classical appearance. Most of these gardens were built around a central axis and they were divided into different parts by hedges. Commonly, gardens had flowerbeds laid out in squares and separated by gravel paths.

Gardens in Renaissance were adorned with sculptures, topiary and fountains. In the 17th century, knot gardens became popular along with the hedge mazes. By this time, Europeans started planting new flowers such as [[tulips]], marigolds and [[sunflowers]].

===Cottage gardens===
[[Cottage garden]]s, which emerged in Elizabethan times, appear to have originated as a local source for herbs and fruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryrie|first=Charlie|title=The Cottage Garden: How to Plan and Plant a Garden That Grows Itself|publisher=[[Collins &amp; Brown]]|year=2004|page=7|isbn=1-84340-216-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VfO_WIAx0wC&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that they arose out of the [[Black Death]] of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens.&lt;ref name="Scott-James80"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott-James|first=Anne|author2=Osbert Lancaster|title=The Pleasure Garden: An Illustrated History of British Gardening|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|year=2004|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbhwIo3m3mQC&amp;pg=PA80|isbn=978-0-7112-2360-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the late 19th-century legend of origin,&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Scott-James]], ''The Cottage Garden'' (London: Lane) 1981, de-mythologised the origins of the English cottage garden, and its treasured [[topiary]] among the vegetables and flowers, popularly supposed to represent heirlooms from the seventeenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, to provide them with food and herbs, with flowers planted among them for decoration. Farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a small garden—about {{convert|1|acre}}—where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens.&lt;ref&gt;''A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840'', Howard Colvin, [[Yale University Press]], 2008
{{ISBN|0-300-12508-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CSyaO-MqYoAC&amp;pg=PA659 p 659]&lt;/ref&gt;

Authentic gardens of the [[Yeoman|yeoman cottager]] would have included a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, along with a well. The peasant cottager of medieval times was more interested in meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); [[calendula]]s and [[primula vulgaris|primroses]] were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as [[sweet william]] and [[hollyhock]]s, were grown entirely for their beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Christopher|author2=Richard Bird|others=Jacqui Hurst|title=The Cottage Garden|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=1999|pages=6–9|isbn=978-0-7513-0702-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
In the 18th century, gardens were laid out more naturally, without any walls. This style of smooth undulating grass, which would run straight to the house, clumps, belts and scattering of trees and his serpentine lakes formed by invisibly damming small rivers, were a new style within the English landscape, a "gardenless" form of landscape gardening, which swept away almost all the remnants of previous formally patterned styles. The English garden usually included a lake, lawns set against groves of trees, and often contained shrubberies, grottoes, pavilions, bridges and [[folly|follies]] such as mock temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. This new style emerged in [[England]] in the early 18th century, and spread across [[Europe]], replacing the more formal, symmetrical [[Garden à la française]] of the 17th century as the principal gardening style of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe'', Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The English garden presented an idealized view of nature. They were often inspired by paintings of landscapes by [[Claude Lorraine]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]], and some were Influenced by the classic [[Chinese gardens]] of the East,&lt;ref name=Boults/&gt; which had recently been described by European travelers.&lt;ref name=Boults&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated History of Landscape Design|author=Boults, Elizabeth and Chip Sullivan|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2010|isbn=0-470-28933-3|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work of [[Capability Brown|Lancelot 'Capability' Brown]] was particularly influential.   Also, in 1804 the Horticultural Society was formed. Gardens of the 19th century contained plants such as the monkey puzzle or Chile pine. This is also the time when the so-called "gardenesque" style of gardens evolved. These gardens displayed a wide variety of flowers in a rather small space. [[Rock garden]]s increased in popularity in the 19th century.

==Types==
{{main|List of garden types}}
[[File:SF Conservatory of Flowers 3.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Conservatory of Flowers in [[Golden Gate Park]], [[San Francisco]]]]
[[File:Hanging baskets in thornbury arp.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Hanging basket]]s in [[Thornbury, South Gloucestershire]]]]
[[Garden design|Residential gardening]] takes place near the home, in a space referred to as the '''garden'''. Although a garden typically is located on the land near a residence, it may also be located [[roof garden|on a roof]], in an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], on a [[balcony]], in a [[windowbox]], or [[Patio|on a patio]] or [[vivarium]].

Gardening also takes place in non-residential green areas, such as parks, public or semi-public gardens ([[botanical garden]]s or [[zoo|zoological gardens]]), [[amusement park]]s, along transportation corridors, and around [[tourism|tourist attractions]] and [[garden hotels]]. In these situations, a staff of gardeners or [[groundskeeper]]s maintains the gardens.
* [[Garden|Indoor gardening]] is concerned with the growing of [[houseplant]]s within a residence or building, in a [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]], or in a [[greenhouse]]. Indoor gardens are sometimes incorporated as part of [[air conditioning]] or heating systems. Indoor gardening extends the growing season in the fall and spring and can be used for [[winter gardening]].
* [[Native plant gardening]] is concerned with the use of [[native plants]] with or without the intent of creating [[wildlife habitat]]. The goal is to create a garden in harmony with, and adapted to a given area. This type of gardening typically reduces water usage, maintenance, and fertilization costs, while increasing [[native fauna]]l interest.
* [[Water garden]]ing is concerned with growing plants adapted to pools and ponds. [[Bog]] gardens are also considered a type of water garden. These all require special conditions and considerations. A simple water garden may consist solely of a tub containing the water and plant(s). In [[aquascaping]], a garden is created within an [[aquarium]] tank.
* [[Container garden]]ing is concerned with growing plants in any type of container either indoors or outdoors. Common containers are pots, [[hanging basket]]s, and planters. Container gardening is usually used in atriums and on balconies, patios, and roof tops.
* [[Compost#Hügelkultur|Hügelkultur]] is concerned with growing plants on piles of rotting wood, as a form of [[raised bed gardening]] and composting [[In situ#Biology|in situ]].&lt;ref name="richsoil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/|title=hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds|website=www.richsoil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An English [[loanword]] from German, it means "mound garden." [[Toby Hemenway]], noted [[Permaculture]] author and teacher, considers wood buried in trenches to also be a form of hugelkultur referred to as a dead wood [[Swale (landform)|swale]].&lt;ref&gt;Hemenway, Toby (2009). ''Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture''. Chelsea Green Publishing. pp. 84-85. {{ISBN|978-1-60358-029-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hugelkultur is practiced by [[Sepp Holzer]] as a method of [[forest gardening]] and [[agroforestry]], and by [[Geoff Lawton]] as a method of [[dryland farming]] and [[desert greening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.org.au/2009/12/11/greening-the-desert-ii-final/|title=Greening the Desert II|date=11 December 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used as a method of disposing of large volumes of waste wood and woody debris, hugelkultur accomplishes [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref name="richsoil" /&gt; It is also a form of [[xeriscaping]].
* [[Community gardening]] is a social activity in which an area of land is gardened by a group of people, providing access to fresh produce and plants as well as access to satisfying labor, neighborhood improvement, sense of community and connection to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communitygarden.org/learn/ |publisher=American Community Garden Association |year=2007 |title=What is a community garden? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204082111/http://www.communitygarden.org/learn/ |archivedate=4 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannah, A. K. &amp; Oh, P. (2000) Rethinking Urban Poverty: A look at Community Gardens. ''Bulletin of Science, Technology and &amp; Society.'' 20(3). 207-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Community gardens are typically owned in trust by local governments or nonprofits.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, J., Norman, C. &amp; Sempik, J. (2001) People, Land and Sustainability: Community Gardens and the Social Dimension of Sustainable Development. ''Social Policy and Administration.'' 35(5). 559-568.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Garden sharing]] partners landowners with gardeners in need of land. These shared gardens, typically front or back [[yard (land)|yards]], are usually used to produce food that is divided between the two parties.
* [[Organic horticulture|Organic gardening]] uses natural, sustainable methods, fertilizers and pesticides to grow non-[[genetically modified crops]].

==Garden features and accessories==
There is a wide range of features and accessories available in the market for both the professional gardener and the amateur to exercise their creativity. These are used to add decoration or functionality, and may be made from a wide range of materials such as copper, stone, wood, bamboo, [[stainless steel]], [[clay]], [[stained glass]], concrete, or iron. Examples include [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]], [[arbor (garden)|arbor]]s, statues, [[Bench (furniture)|benches]], [[water fountains]], [[urns]], bird baths and feeders, and garden lighting such as candle [[lanterns]] and [[oil lamps]]. The use of these items can be part of the expression of a gardener's gardening personality.

==Comparison with farming==
[[File:Jardinage petits outils.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.8|Hand gardening tools]]

Gardening for beauty is likely{{original research inline|date=January 2018}} nearly as old as farming for food, however for most of history for the majority of people there was no real distinction since the need for food and other useful products trumped other concerns. Small-scale, [[subsistence agriculture]] (called [[hoe-farming]]) is largely indistinguishable from gardening. A patch of potatoes grown by a Peruvian peasant or an Irish smallholder for personal use could be described as either a garden or a farm. Gardening for average people evolved as a separate discipline, more concerned with aesthetics, [[recreation]] and [[leisure]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
under the influence of the pleasure gardens of the wealthy.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  Meanwhile, farming has evolved (in developed countries) in the direction of [[commercial agriculture|commercialization]], [[economics of scale]], and [[monocropping]].

In respect to its food-producing purpose, gardening is distinguished{{by whom|date=January 2018}} from [[Agriculture|farming]] chiefly by scale and intent. Farming occurs on a larger scale, and with the production of salable goods as a major motivation. Gardening happens on a smaller scale, primarily for pleasure and to produce goods for the gardener's own family or community. There is some overlap between the terms, particularly in that some moderate-sized vegetable growing concerns, often called [[market gardening]], can fit in either category.
[[File:Brian Farrell plants.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Planting in a garden]]
The key distinction between gardening and farming is essentially one of scale; gardening can be a hobby or an income supplement, but farming is generally understood{{by whom|date=January 2018}} as a full-time or commercial activity, usually involving more land and quite different practices. One distinction is that gardening is labor-intensive and employs very little [[infrastructural capital]], sometimes no more than a few tools, e.g. a [[spade]], [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], [[basket]] and [[watering can]]. By contrast, larger-scale farming often involves [[irrigation|irrigation systems]], chemical [[fertilizer]]s and [[combine harvester|harvesters]] or at least [[ladder]]s, e.g. to reach up into [[fruit tree]]s. However, this distinction is becoming blurred with the increasing use of power tools in even small gardens.

In part because of labor intensity and aesthetic motivations, gardening is very often much more productive per unit of land than farming.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In the [[Soviet Union]], half the [[food security|food supply]] came from small peasants' garden plots on the huge government-run [[collective farming|collective farms]], although they were tiny patches of land.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Some{{Who|date=October 2015}} argue this as evidence of the superiority of [[capitalism]], since the [[kolkhoznik|peasant]]s could generally sell their produce. Others{{Who|date=October 2015}} consider it to be evidence of a [[tragedy of the commons]], since the large collective plots were often{{quantify|date=January 2018}} neglected, with fertilizers or water redirected to the private gardens.

[[Monty Don]] has speculated on an atavistic connection between present-day gardeners and pre-modern [[peasantry]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[precision agriculture]] is sometimes used{{by whom|date=January 2018}} to describe gardening using [[Appropriate technology|intermediate technology]] (more than tools, less than harvesters), especially of [[organic farming|organic varieties]]. Gardening is effectively scaled up to feed entire villages of over 100 people from specialized plots. A variant is the [[community gardening|community garden]] which offers plots to urban dwellers; see further in [[allotment (gardening)]].

==Gardens as art==
{{See also|Landscape architecture}}
[[File:Schultenhof Mettingen Bauerngarten 8.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Garden at the Schultenhof in [[Mettingen]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany]]
[[Garden design]] is considered to be an art in most cultures, distinguished from gardening, which generally means ''garden maintenance''. Garden design can include different themes such as perennial, butterfly, wildlife, Japanese, water, [[Tropical garden|tropical]], or shade gardens. In Japan, [[Samurai]] and [[Zen|Zen monks]] were often required to build decorative gardens or practice related skills like [[floristry|flower arrangement]] known as ''[[ikebana]]''. In 18th-century Europe, country estates were refashioned by landscape gardeners into [[Garden design|formal gardens]] or landscaped park lands, such as at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], France, or [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]], England. Today, [[landscape architect]]s and [[garden designer]]s continue to produce artistically creative designs for private garden spaces. In the US, professional landscape designers are certified by the Association of Professional Landscape Designers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apld.org APLD.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social aspects==
People can express their political or social views in gardens, intentionally or not. The lawn vs. garden issue is played out in [[urban planning]] as the debate over the "[[land ethic]]" that is to determine urban [[land use]] and whether hyper [[hygiene|hygienist]] [[bylaw]]s (e.g. [[weed control]]) should apply, or whether land should generally be allowed to exist in its natural wild state. In a famous [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights]] case, "Sandra Bell vs. City of Toronto", 1997, the right to cultivate all native species, even most varieties deemed noxious or allergenic, was upheld as part of the [[Freedom of speech|right of free expression]].

[[Community gardening]] comprises a wide variety of approaches to sharing land and gardens.

People often surround their house and garden with a hedge. Common hedge plants are [[privet]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]], [[beech]], [[Taxus|yew]], [[Leyland Cypress|leyland cypress]], [[Tsuga|hemlock]], [[Thuja occidentalis|arborvitae]], [[Berberis|barberry]], [[Buxus|box]], [[holly]], [[Nerium oleander|oleander]], [[forsythia]] and [[lavender]]. The idea of open gardens without hedges may be distasteful to those who enjoy privacy.
The [[Slow Food]] movement has sought in some countries to add an edible school yard and garden classrooms to schools, e.g. in [[Fergus, Ontario]], where these were added to a public school to augment the kitchen classroom. [[Garden sharing]], where urban landowners allow gardeners to grow on their property in exchange for a share of the harvest, is associated with the desire to control the quality of one's food, and reconnect with soil and community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/04/ethicalliving.organics Meet the urban sharecroppers] ''The Guardian'', 4 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In US and British usage, the production of ornamental plantings around buildings is called ''[[landscaping]]'', ''[[landscape maintenance]]'' or ''grounds keeping'', while international usage uses the term ''gardening'' for these same activities.

Also gaining popularity is the concept of "Green Gardening" which involves growing plants using organic fertilizers and pesticides so that the gardening process - or the flowers and fruits produced thereby - doesn't adversely affect the environment or people's health in any manner.

==Garden pests==
Garden pests are generally [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], or [[animal]]s (frequently [[insect]]s) that engage in activity that the gardener considers undesirable. A pest may crowd out desirable plants, disturb soil, stunt the growth of young seedlings, steal or damage fruit, or otherwise kill plants, hamper their growth, damage their appearance, or reduce the quality of the edible or ornamental portions of the plant. [[Aphid]]s, [[spider mite]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[ant]]s, [[bird]]s, and even [[cat]]s are commonly considered to be garden pests.

Because gardeners may have different goals, organisms considered "garden pests" vary from gardener to gardener. ''[[Tropaeolum speciosum]]'', for example, may be considered a desirable and ornamental garden plant, or it may be considered a pest if it [[seed]]s and starts to grow where it is not wanted. As another example, in [[lawn]]s, moss can become dominant and be impossible to eradicate. In some lawns, [[lichen]]s, especially very damp lawn lichens such as ''[[Peltigera]] lactucfolia'' and ''P. membranacea'', can become difficult to control and be considered pests.

===Garden pest control===
There are many ways by which unwanted pests are removed from a garden. The techniques vary depending on the pest, the gardener's goals, and the gardener's philosophy. For example, snails may be dealt with through the use of a chemical pesticide, an organic pesticide, hand-picking, barriers, or simply growing snail-resistant plants.

Pest control is often done through the use of [[pesticides]], which may be either [[Organic agriculture|organic]] or artificially synthesized. Pesticides may affect the [[ecology]] of a garden due to their effects on the populations of both target and non-target species. For example, unintended exposure to some [[neonicotinoid]] pesticides has been proposed as a factor in the recent decline in [[honey bee]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/03/28/science.1215039| title=A Common Pesticide Decreases Foraging Success and Survival in Honey Bees|accessdate= 2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mole vibrator can deter mole activity in a garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/1998/04/mole-ested?page=0,2| title=Mole-ested|accessdate= 2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other means of control include the removal of infected plants, using fertilizers and biostimulants to improve the health and vigour of plants so they better resist attack, practising [[crop rotation]] to prevent pest build-up, using [[companion planting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/2010/08/11/episode-24-companion-planting-and-crop-rotation/ |title=The Self-Sufficient Gardener Podcast--Episode 24 Companion Planting and Crop Rotation |accessdate=2010-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918114758/http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/2010/08/11/episode-24-companion-planting-and-crop-rotation/ |archivedate=18 September 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and practising good garden hygiene, such as disinfecting tools and clearing debris and [[weed]]s which may harbour pests.

===Garden Guns===
{{main|Garden guns}}
[[File:.22LR ratshot.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|CCI .22LR snake shot loaded with #12 shot]]

"[[Garden guns|Garden Guns]]" are smooth bore shotguns specifically made to fire [[.22 caliber]] [[snake shot]], and are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for [[pest control]]. Garden Guns are short range weapons that can do little harm past {{convert|15|yard}} to {{convert|20|yard}}, and they're relatively quiet when fired with snake shot, compared to a standard ammunition. These guns are especially effective inside of barns and sheds, as the snake shot will not shoot holes in the roof or walls, or more importantly injure [[livestock]] with a [[ricochet]]. They are also used for pest control at [[airport]]s, [[warehouse]]s, [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], etc.&lt;ref name="Eger"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eger|first1=Christopher|title=Marlin 25MG Garden Gun|url=http://www.marlinforum.com/Marlin-25MG-Garden-Gun.html|website=Marlin Firearms Forum|publisher=Outdoor Hub LLC|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=28 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918005923/http://www.marlinforum.com/Marlin-25MG-Garden-Gun.html|archive-date=18 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iraq Topography.png|thumb|Topography of Iraq.]]

The '''geography of [[Iraq]]''' is diverse and falls into five main regions: 1. the desert (west of the [[Euphrates]]), 2. [[Upper Mesopotamia]] (between the upper [[Tigris]] and Euphrates rivers), 3. the northern highlands of Iraq, and 4. [[Lower Mesopotamia]], 5. the alluvial plain extending from around [[Tikrit]] to the [[Persian Gulf]].

The mountains in the northeast are an extension of the alpine system that runs eastward from the [[Balkans]] through southern [[Turkey]], northern [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], and [[Afghanistan]], eventually reaching the [[Himalayas]]. The [[desert]] is in the southwest and central provinces along the borders with [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Jordan]] and geographically belongs with the [[Arabian Peninsula]].

==Major geographical features==
Most geographers, including those of the Iraqi government, discuss the country's geography in terms of four main zones or regions: the [[desert]] in the west and southwest; the rolling upland between the upper Tigris and Euphrates rivers (in Arabic the ''Dijla'' and ''Furat'', respectively); the highlands in the north and northeast; and the alluvial plain through which the Tigris and Euphrates flow.
Iraq's official statistical reports give the total land area as {{convert|438446|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, whereas a [[United States Department of State]] publication gives the area as {{convert|434934|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

===Upper Mesopotamia===
{{further|Upper Mesopotamia}}
The uplands region, between the Tigris north of [[Samarra]] and the Euphrates north of [[Hit, Iraq|Hit]], is known as [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Al Jazira]] (the island) and is part of a larger area that extends westward into Syria between the two rivers and into [[Turkey]]. Water in the area flows in deeply cut valleys, and [[irrigation]] is much more difficult than it is in the lower plain. The southwest areas of this zone are classified as desert or semi-desert. The northern parts, which include such places like the [[Nineveh Plain]]s, [[Duhok]] and [[Zakho]], mainly consist of [[Mediterranean shrub|Mediterranean]] vegetation. The vegetation cyclically dries out and appear brown in the virtually arid summer and flourish in the wet winter.

===Lower Mesopotamia===
{{further|Lower Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian Marshes|Shatt al-Arab}}

An [[Alluvial plain]] begins north of [[Baghdad]] and extends to the [[Persian Gulf]]. Here the Tigris and Euphrates rivers lie above the level of the plain in many places, and the whole area is a [[river delta]] interlaced by the channels of the two rivers and by irrigation canals. Intermittent [[lake]]s, fed by the rivers in flood, also characterize southeastern Iraq. A fairly large area ({{convert|15000|km2|mi2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) just above the confluence of the two rivers at [[Al Qurnah]] and extending east of the Tigris beyond the Iranian border is marshland, known as [[Hawr al Hammar]], the result of centuries of flooding and inadequate drainage. Much of it is permanent marsh, but some parts dry out in early winter, and other parts become marshland only in years of great flood.

Because the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates above their confluence are heavily [[silt]]- laden, [[irrigation]] and fairly frequent flooding deposit large quantities of silty loam in much of the delta area. Windborne silt contributes to the total deposit of sediments. It has been estimated that the delta plains are built up at the rate of nearly twenty centimeters in a century. In some areas, major floods lead to the deposit in temporary lakes of as much as thirty centimeters of mud.

The Tigris and Euphrates also carry large quantities of [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s. These, too, are spread on the land by sometimes excessive irrigation and flooding. A high [[water table]] and poor surface and subsurface drainage tend to concentrate the salts near the surface of the soil. In general, the salinity of the soil increases from Baghdad south to the Persian Gulf and severely limits productivity in the region south of [[Al Amarah]]. The [[salinity]] is reflected in the large lake in central Iraq, southwest of Baghdad, known as [[Bahr al Milh]] (Sea of Salt). There are two other major lakes in the country to the north of Bahr al Milh: [[Buhayrat ath Tharthar]] and [[Buhayrat al Habbaniyah]].

===Baghdad area===
{{main|Baghdad Belts}}
Between Upper and Lower Mesopotamia is the urban area surrounding [[Baghdad]].
These "[[Baghdad Belts]]" can be described as the provinces adjacent to the Iraqi capital and can be divided into four quadrants: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest. Beginning in the north, the belts include the province of [[Salah ad Din Governorate|Salah ad Din]], clockwise to Baghdad province, [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]] in the North-east, [[Babil]] and [[Wasit Governorate|Wasit]] in the south east and around to [[Al Anbar]] in the west.

===Highlands===
{{main|Northern Iraq}}
The northeastern highlands begin just south of a line drawn from [[Mosul]] to [[Kirkuk]] and extend to the borders with [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]. High ground, separated by broad, undulating [[steppe]]s, gives way to mountains ranging from {{convert|1000|to|4000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} near the Iranian and Turkish borders. Except for a few valleys, the mountain area proper is suitable only for grazing in the foothills and steppes; adequate soil and rainfall, however, make cultivation possible. Here, too, are the great oil fields near Mosul and Kirkuk. The northeast is the homeland of most Iraqi [[Kurd]]s.

===Desert===
{{main|Syrian Desert|Arabian Desert}}

The desert zone, an area lying west and southwest of the Euphrates River, is a part of the [[Syrian Desert]] and [[Arabian Desert]], which covers sections of [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Saudi Arabia]] and most of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].
The region, sparsely inhabited by pastoral [[bedouins]], consists of a wide stony plain interspersed with rare sandy stretches. A widely ramified pattern of [[wadi]]s–watercourses that are dry most of the year–runs from the border to the Euphrates. Some [[wadi]]s are over {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and carry brief but torrential floods during the winter rains.

Western and southern Iraq is a vast desert region covering some 64,900 square miles (168 square km), almost two-fifths of the country.
The western desert, an extension of the Syrian Desert, rises to elevations above 1,600 feet (490 metres).
The southern desert is known as Al-Hajarah in the western part and as Al-Dibdibah in the east. Both deserts are part of the Arabian Desert.
Al Hajarah has a complex topography of rocky desert, wadis, ridges, and depressions.
Al-Dibdibah is a more sandy region with a covering of scrub vegetation. Elevation in the southern desert averages between 1,000 and 2,700 feet (300 to 800 metres).
A height of 3,119 feet (951 metres) is reached at Mount 'Unayzah at the intersection of the borders of Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
The deep Wadi Al-Batin runs 45 miles (75&amp;nbsp;km) in a northeast-southwest direction through Al-Dibdibah. It has been recognized since 1913 as the boundary between western [[Kuwait]] and Iraq.

==Tigris–Euphrates river system==
{{main|Tigris–Euphrates river system}}
The Euphrates originates in Turkey, is augmented by the [[Balikh River|Balikh]] and [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]] rivers in Syria, and enters Iraq in the northwest. Here it is fed only by the wadis of the western desert during the winter rains. It then winds through a gorge, which varies from two to 16 kilometers in width, until it flows out on the plain at [[Ar Ramadi]]. Beyond there the Euphrates continues to the [[Hindiya Barrage]], which was constructed in 1914 to divert the river into the Hindiyah Channel; the present day Shatt al Hillah had been the main channel of the Euphrates before 1914. Below [[Al Kifl]], the river follows two channels to [[As-Samawah]], where it reappears as a single channel to join the Tigris at [[Al Qurnah]].
The Tigris also rises in Turkey but is significantly augmented by several rivers in Iraq, the most important of which are the [[Khabur (Tigris)|Khabur]], the [[Great Zab]], the [[Little Zab]], and the [[Adhaim]], all of which join the Tigris above Baghdad, and the [[Diyala River|Diyala]], which joins it about thirty-six kilometers below the city. At the [[Kut Barrage]] much of the water is diverted into the [[Shatt al-Hayy]], which was once the main channel of the Tigris. Water from the Tigris thus enters the Euphrates through the Shatt al-Hayy well above the confluence of the two main channels at [[Al Qurnah]].

Both the Tigris and the Euphrates break into a number of channels in the marshland area, and the flow of the rivers is substantially reduced by the time they come together at Al Qurnah. Moreover. the swamps act as silt traps, and the Shatt al Arab is relatively silt free as it flows south. Below [[Basra]], however, the [[Karun River]] enters the [[Shatt al Arab]] from Iran, carrying large quantities of silt that present a continuous dredging problem in maintaining a channel for ocean-going vessels to reach the port at [[Basra]]. This problem has been superseded by a greater obstacle to river traffic, however, namely the presence of several sunken hulls that have been rusting in the Shatt al Arab since early in the Iran-Iraq war.

The waters of the Tigris and Euphrates are essential to the life of the country, but they sometimes threaten it. The rivers are at their lowest level in September and October and at flood in March, April, and May when they may carry forty times as much water as at low mark. Moreover, one season's flood may be ten or more times as great as that in another year. In 1954, for example, Baghdad was seriously threatened, and [[Dyke (construction)|dikes]] protecting it were nearly topped by the flooding Tigris. Since Syria built a dam on the Euphrates, the flow of water has been considerably diminished and flooding was no longer a problem in the mid-1980s. In 1988 Turkey was also constructing a dam on the Euphrates that would further restrict the water flow.

Until the mid-twentieth century, most efforts to control the waters were primarily concerned with irrigation. Some attention was given to problems of flood control and drainage before the revolution of July 14, 1958, but development plans in the 1960s and 1970s were increasingly devoted to these matters, as well as to irrigation projects on the upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates and the tributaries of the Tigris in the northeast. During the war, government officials stressed to foreign visitors that, with the conclusion of a peace settlement, problems of irrigation and flooding would receive top priority from the government.

==Coral reef==
Iraqi [[coastal waters]] boast a living [[coral reef]], covering an area of 28&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[Persian Gulf]], at the mouth of the [[Shatt al-Arab]] river ({{Coord|29|37|00|N|48|48|00|E|display=inline}}).&lt;ref name="sr"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nature.com/srep/2014/140306/srep04250/full/srep04250.html|author1=Thomas Pohl |author2=Sameh W.

Ali |author4=Nadia Al-Mudaffar Fawzi |author5=Hermann Ehrlich |author6=Broder Merkel |title =Discovery of a living coral reef in the coastal waters of Iraq |publisher =''[[Scientific Reports]]''|doi=10.1038/srep04250|date=6 March 2014| accessdate =6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coral reef was discovered by joint Iraqi–German expeditions of scientific scuba divers carried out in September 2012 and in May 2013.&lt;ref name="sr"/&gt; Prior to its discovery, it was believed that Iraq lacks coral reefs as the local turbid waters prevented the detection of the potential presence of local coral reefs. Iraqi corals were found to be adapted to one of the most extreme coral-bearing environments in the world, as the seawater temperature in this area ranges between 14 and 34&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="sr"/&gt; The reef harbors several living stone corals, [[octocorals]], [[ophiuroids]] and [[bivalves]].&lt;ref name="sr"/&gt; There are also [[silica]]-containing demo-sponges.&lt;ref name="sr"/&gt;

==Settlement patterns==
In the rural areas of the alluvial plain and in the lower Diyala region, settlement almost invariably clusters near the rivers, streams, and irrigation canals. The bases of the relationship between watercourse and settlement have been summarized by Robert McCormick Adams, director of the Oriental Institute of the [[University of Chicago]]. He notes that the levees laid down by streams and canals provide advantages for both settlement and agriculture. Surface water drains more easily on the levees' back-slope, and the coarse soils of the levees are easier to cultivate and permit better subsurface drainage. The height of the levees gives some protection against floods and the frost that often affect low-lying areas and may kill and/or damage winter crops. Above all, those living or cultivating on the crest of a levee have easy access to water for irrigation and household use in a dry, hot country.

Although there are some isolated homesteads, most rural communities are nucleated settlements rather than dispersed farmsteads; that is, the farmer leaves his village to cultivate the fields outside it. The pattern holds for farming communities in the [[Kurd]]ish highlands of the northeast as well as for those in the alluvial plain. The size of the settlement varies, generally with the volume of water available for household use and with the amount of land accessible to village dwellers. Sometimes, particularly in the lower Tigris and Euphrates valleys, [[soil salinity]] restricts the area of arable land and limits the size of the community dependent on it, and it also usually results in large unsettled and uncultivated stretches between the villages.

Fragmentary information suggests that most farmers in the alluvial plain tend to live in villages of over 100 persons. For example, in the mid-1970s a substantial number of the residents of [[Baqubah]], the administrative center and major city of Diyala Governorate, were employed in agriculture.

The Marsh Arabs of the south usually live in small clusters of two or three houses kept above water by [[Juncaceae|rushes]] that are constantly being replenished. Such clusters often are close together, but access from one to another is possible only by small boat. Here and there a few natural islands permit slightly larger clusters. Some of these people are primarily [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] herders and lead a semi-[[nomad]]ic life. In the winter, when the waters are at a low point, they build fairly large temporary villages. In the summer they move their herds out of the marshes to the river banks.

The war has had its effect on the lives of these denizens of the marshes. With much of the fighting concentrated in their areas, they have either migrated to settled communities away from the marshes or have been forced by government decree to relocate within the marshes. Also, in early 1988, the marshes had become the refuge of deserters from the Iraqi army who attempted to maintain life in the fastness of the overgrown, desolate areas while hiding out from the authorities. These deserters in many instances have formed into large gangs that raid the marsh communities; this also has induced many of the marsh dwellers to abandon their villages.

The war has also affected settlement patterns in the northern [[Kurd]]ish areas. There, the struggle for a Kurdish state by [[guerrillas]] was rejected by the government as it steadily escalated volence against the local communities. Starting in 1984, the government launched a scorched-earth campaign to drive a wedge between the villagers and the [[guerrillas]] in the remote areas of two provinces of [[Kurdistan]] in which Kurdish guerrillas were active. In the process whole villages were torched and subsequently bulldozed, which resulted in the Kurds flocking into the regional centers of [[Irbil]] and [[As Sulaymaniyah]]. Also as a "military precaution", the government has cleared a broad strip of territory in the Kurdish region along the [[Iran]]ian border of all its inhabitants, hoping in this way to interdict the movement of Kurdish guerrillas back and forth between Iran and Iraq. The majority of [[Kurd]]ish villages, however, remained intact in early 1988.

In the arid areas of Iraq to the west and south, cities and large towns are almost invariably situated on watercourses, usually on the major rivers or their larger tributaries. In the south this dependence has had its disadvantages. Until the recent development of flood control, [[Baghdad]] and other cities were subject to the threat of inundation. Moreover, the [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] needed for protection have effectively prevented the expansion of the urban areas in some directions. The growth of [[Baghdad]], for example, was restricted by dikes on its eastern edge. The diversion of water to the Milhat ath Tharthar and the construction of a canal transferring water from the Tigris north of Baghdad to the [[Diyala River]] have permitted the irrigation of land outside the limits of the dikes and the expansion of settlement.

The climate of Iraq is mainly a [[hot desert climate]] or a [[hot semi-arid climate]] to the northernmost part. Averages high temperatures are generally above 40&amp;nbsp;°C (104&amp;nbsp;°F) at low elevations during summer months (June, July and August) while averages low temperatures can drop to below 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) during the coldest month of the year during winter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Weather longterm historical data Baghdad, Iraq |newspaper=The Washington Post |year=1999 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/weather/longterm/historical/data/baghdad_iraq.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhbsTqqj?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/weather/longterm/historical/data/baghdad_iraq.htm |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The all-time record high temperature in Iraq of 52&amp;nbsp;°C (126&amp;nbsp;°F) was recorded near [[An Nasiriyah]] on 2 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Brugge, Roger |title=World weather news, August 2011 |publisher=Department of Meteorology, University of Reading |url=http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~brugge/world2011.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhcxKyga?url=http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~brugge/world2011.html |archivedate=29 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the rainfall occurs from December through April and averages between {{convert|100|and|180|mm|1|sp=us}} annually. The mountainous region of northern Iraq receives appreciably more precipitation than the central or southern desert region, where they tend to have a [[Mediterranean climate]].

Roughly 90% of the annual rainfall occurs between November and April, most of it in the winter months from December through March. The remaining six months, particularly the hottest ones of June, July, and August, are extremely dry.

Except in the north and northeast, mean annual rainfall ranges between {{convert|100|and|190|mm|in|sp=us}}. Data available from stations in the foothills and steppes south and southwest of the mountains suggest mean annual rainfall between {{convert|320|and|570|mm|in|1|sp=us}} for that area. Rainfall in the mountains is more abundant and may reach {{convert|1,000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} a year in some places, but the terrain precludes extensive cultivation. Cultivation on nonirrigated land is limited essentially to the mountain valleys, foothills, and [[steppes]], which have {{convert|300|mm|in|1|sp=us}} or more of rainfall annually. Even in this zone, however, only one crop a year can be grown, and shortages of rain have often led to crop failures.

Mean minimum temperatures in the winter range from near freezing (just before dawn) in the northern and northeastern foothills and the western desert to {{convert|2|to|3|C|F|1}} and {{convert|4|to|5|C|F|1}} in the alluvial plains of southern Iraq. They rise to a mean maximum of about {{convert|16|°C|°F|1}} in the western desert and the northeast, and {{convert|17|°C|°F|1}} in the south. In the summer mean minimum temperatures range from about {{convert|27|to|31|C|F|1}} and rise to maxima between roughly {{convert|41|and|45|C|F|1}}. Temperatures sometimes fall below freezing and have fallen as low as {{convert|-14|°C|°F|1}} at Ar Rutbah in the western desert. A such summer heat, even in a hot desert, is high and this can be easily explained by the very low elevations of deserts regions which experience these exceptionally searing high temperatures. In fact, the elevations of cities such as [[Baghdad]] or [[Basra]] are near the sea level (0 m) because deserts are located predominantly along the [[Persian Gulf]]. That's why some Gulf's countries like [[Iraq]], [[Iran]] and [[Kuwait]] experience extreme heat during summer, even more extreme than the normal level. The searing summer heat only exists in low elevations in these countries while mountains and higher elevations know much more moderated summer temperatures.

The summer months are marked by two kinds of wind phenomena. The southern and southeasterly ''sharqi'', a dry, dusty wind with occasional gusts of {{convert|80|km/h|sp=us}}, occurs from April to early June and again from late September through November. It may last for a day at the beginning and end of the season but for several days at other times. This wind is often accompanied by violent duststorms that may rise to heights of several thousand meters and close airports for brief periods. From mid-June to mid-September the prevailing wind, called the [[shamal (wind)|shamal]], is from the north and northwest. It is a steady wind, absent only occasionally during this period. The very dry air brought by this shamal permits intensive sun heating of the land surface, but the breeze has some cooling effect.

The combination of rain shortage and extreme heat makes much of Iraq a desert. Because of very high rates of evaporation, soil and plants rapidly lose the little moisture obtained from the rain, and vegetation could not survive without extensive irrigation. Some areas, however, although arid, do have natural vegetation in contrast to the desert. For example, in the [[Zagros]] Mountains in northeastern Iraq there is permanent vegetation, such as [[oak]] trees, and [[date palm]]s are found in the south.

==Area and Boundaries==
In 1922 British officials concluded the Treaty of Mohammara with Abd al Aziz ibn Abd ar Rahman [[Al Saud]], who in 1932 formed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The treaty provided the basic agreement for the boundary between the eventually independent nations. Also in 1922 the two parties agreed to the creation of the diamond-shaped Neutral Zone of approximately {{convert|7500|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} adjacent to the western tip of Kuwait in which neither Iraq nor Saudi Arabia would build dwellings or installations. [[Bedouin]]s from either country could utilize the limited water and seasonal grazing resources of the zone. In April 1975, an agreement signed in [[Baghdad]] fixed the borders of the countries.

Through [[Algeria]]n mediation, Iran and Iraq agreed in March 1975 to normalize their relations, and three months later they signed a treaty known as the [[1975 Algiers Agreement|Algiers Accord]]. The document defined the common border all along the [[Khawr Abd Allah]] (Shatt) River [[estuary]] as the [[thalweg]]. To compensate Iraq for the loss of what formerly had been regarded as its territory, pockets of territory along the mountain border in the central sector of its common boundary with Iran were assigned to it. Nonetheless, in September 1980 Iraq went to war with [[Iran]], citing among other complaints the fact that Iran had not turned over to it the land specified in the [[1975 Algiers Agreement|Algiers Accord]]. This problem has subsequently proved to be a stumbling block to a negotiated settlement of the ongoing conflict.

In 1988 the boundary with [[Kuwait]] was another outstanding problem. It was fixed in a 1913 treaty between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] officials acting on behalf of [[Politics of Kuwait|Kuwait's ruling family]], which in 1899 had ceded control over foreign affairs to Britain. The boundary was accepted by Iraq when it became independent in 1932, but in the 1960s and again in the mid-1970s, the Iraqi government advanced a claim to parts of Kuwait. [[Kuwait]] made several representations to the Iraqis during the war to fix the border once and for all but [[Baghdad]] repeatedly demurred, claiming that the issue is a potentially divisive one that could inflame nationalist sentiment inside Iraq. Hence in 1988 it was likely that a solution would have to wait until the war ended.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8399">'''Gil Joseph Wolman''' ([[Paris]], 1929 – Paris, 1995) was a [[France|French]] artist. His work encompassed painting, poetry and film-making. He was a member of [[Isidore Isou]]'s [[avant garde]] [[Lettrist|Letterist]] movement in the early 1950s, then becoming a central figure in the [[Letterist International]], the group which would subsequently develop (without Wolman himself) into the [[Situationist International]].

==Lettrism==
Wolman joined the Letterists in 1950, although he quit the group only two years later. His first published work appeared in the 1950 first issue of their journal ''Ur'', where his 'Introduction to Wolman' would set the scene for later creations: "In the beginning, there was Wolman"! While still in the group, Wolman would make two major contributions. First, in [[sound poetry]], he devised the notion of the 'megapneume': while lettrism was based upon the letter, megapneumes were based upon the breath. Second, in film, he produced ''[[Anticoncept|L'Anticoncept]]'', the work for which he is now primarily remembered. The film was shown for the first time on 11 February 1952 at the 'Avant-Garde 52' cinema club. It consisted of blank illumination projected onto a weather balloon, accompanied by a staccato spoken soundtrack. The film was banned by the French censors on 2 April 1952—when the Letterists visited the [[Cannes Film Festival]] the following month, they were forced to restrict the audience to journalists only. The [http://www.notbored.org/anticoncept.html text] of the soundtrack was published in the sole issue of the Letterist journal ''Ion'' (1952; reprinted Jean-Paul Rocher, 1999), and later reissued in a separate edition augmented with associated texts (Editions Allia, 1994). ''Ion'' also included the [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/debord.films/howls.htm text] of [[Guy Debord]]'s film [http://www.ubu.com/film/debord.html ''Howls for Sade''], which was dedicated to Wolman and featured his voice in its own soundtrack.

==First Letterist International==
In June 1952, Wolman and Debord formed the [[Letterist International]], which, with [[Jean-Louis Brau]] and [[Serge Berna]], would officially split from the main group that December. Wolman contributed several texts to the Letterist International's own bulletin, ''Potlatch''; and, with Debord, he co-authored some of its most important texts, published in the Belgian [[surrealist]] review ''[[Les Lèvres Nues]]'' (Naked Lips). These included 'A User's Guide to Détournement' and 'Theory of the Dérive' (both 1956). The term ''[[détournement]]'' (literally 'diversion') signified the deliberate re-use of plagiarised material for a new and usually subversive purpose. The ''dérive'' ('drift') was a process of aimlessly wandering through urban environments in order to map their [[psychogeography]].

In 1955, Wolman wrote [http://www.unpopular.org.uk/lettrism/whylettrism.html Why Lettrism?], also with Guy Debord, published in ''Potlatch'' no. 22. The following year, he represented the Letterist International at the [[World Congress of Artists]] in [[Alba Docilia|Alba]], [[Italy]]. This conference established important links between the Letterist International and those figures (primarily [[Asger Jorn]] and [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio|Pinot-Gallizio]] of the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]]) who would soon afterwards be joining forces with it to form the Situationist International. Wolman himself, however, never made it as far as the Situationist International. He was officially excluded from the Letterist International on 13 January 1957, just six months before the creation of the new group, the exclusion being announced in obituary format in ''Potlatch'' no. 28. Debord seems to have been the driving force behind the exclusion, which did cause some consternation among his colleagues. Even [[Michèle Bernstein]], Debord's wife at the time, has stated that she did not understand why Debord took so suddenly against Wolman.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hussey, ''The Game of War'' (Jonathan Cape, 2001), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Michel Mension]], an early member of the Letterist International, recalls that "Gil was reticent, sweet—an incredibly sweet guy. I don't think I ever heard him actually raise his voice, except occasionally, except when he was reciting his poetry, but that was different. Everyone loved Gil."&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Mension, ''The Tribe'' (Verse, 2002), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; He also could not understand why Debord had excluded him, and observed: "I think Wolman, in Guy's eyes, was a truly extraordinary artist, clearly superior to the other artists in the Letterist International. Personally, I've never believed in the exclusion of Gil.".&lt;ref&gt;-Michel Mension (2002), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Rumney]], an early member of the Situationist International, speculated that the real reason behind the exclusion was that Wolman and his wife, Violette, had just had a child: "Guy, and Michèle for that matter, had an absolute horror of domesticity and babies in particular. They were trying to experiment with new ways of living, which for Guy meant total sexual freedom. Wolman's happy family life could not be tolerated."&lt;ref&gt;''The Game of War'', p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Back with the Lettrists / Second Letterist International==
Following his exclusion, Wolman continued to develop his own work, and he re-established links with the original Letterist movement and exhibited with them from 1961 to 1964. He devised [[Scotch Art]] in 1963, a process which consists in tearing off bands of printed matter and using adhesive tape to reposition them on fabrics or wood. In 1964, however, he split again from Isou's group, to establish the short-lived Second Letterist International with [[Jean-Louis Brau]] and [[François Dufrêne]]; thereafter, Wolman worked largely in isolation. He later developed the "separatist movement", and series of "dühring dühring", "decompositions" and finally "depicted painting".

==Posterity==

Three years after his death, the magazine "Poézi Prolétèr" (No.2), directed by Katalin Molnar and [[Christophe Tarkos]], published in 1998 an article on Wolman including several of his texts gathered under the title "Introduction of the word". Although at times often seen as a side-kick of Guy Debord, he is now regarded, along with [[Robert Filliou]], as one of the more influential artists of his day. Wolman, however, who started a decade before Filliou, did not subscribe to Filliou's "genius without talent", but rather said that "genius is what we all have when we stop improving one thing in order to make something else. When we only refuse to have talent" (1964).

Several of Wolman's audio recordings were published through [[Henri Chopin]]'s journal, ''OU''; and an l.p., ''L'Anticoncept'', was issued in 1999 by Alga Marghen, which gathered together various sound works from 1951 to 1972. A volume of his uncollected writings was published in 2001 by Editions Allia, ''Défense de mourir''. The first international retrospective of Wolman's works was held at MACBA (Barcelona, 2010) and Museu SERRALVES (Porto, 2011), curated by [[Frédéric Acquaviva]], Bartomeu Mari and Joao Fernandes, with a catalogue "Gil J Wolman, I am immortal and alive" in 3 different versions : english, spanish-catalan, french-portuguese. The Centre Pompidou in Paris devoted a room to Wolman's works in 2015 while La Plaque Tournante, an independent art space in Berlin, programmed the first Wolman Retrospective in Germany with 500 works and documents.

'''ISO 3166-2:BW''' is the entry for [[Botswana]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Botswana, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[districts of Botswana|10 districts]], 4 towns, and 2 cities.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|BW}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Botswana. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''''India Reloaded: Inside India’s Resurgent Consumer Market''''' is a 2015 book that was written by [[Dheeraj Sinha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Narayanan|first1=Chitra|title=Marketers have been sent on a wild goose chase|url=http://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/lifestyle/reviews/marketers-have-been-sent-on-a-wild-goose-chase/story/222537.html|publisher=Business Today|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published on July 24, 2015, through [[Palgrave Macmillan]] and examines India's consumer market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balakrishnan|first1=Ravi|title=Dheeraj Sinha debunks India's pet marketing beliefs in new book|url=http://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/marketing/greys-dheeraj-sinha-debunks-indian-marketings-pet-beliefs-in-new-book/49245169|publisher=Brand Equity|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
In the book Sinha reviews data from several outlets in order to examine success in the Indian consumer market. He also looks at several myths and contradictions surrounding this market and draws upon his own experiences.

==Reception==
''[[Brand Equity (Weekly)|Brand Equity]]'' wrote a mostly favorable review, criticizing Sinha for utilizing "bland business terms" while commending him for the "range and breadth of sources from which Dheeraj draws his data points, and mines them for insight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book review: Dheeraj Sinha's 'India Reloaded'|url=http://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/advertising/book-review-india-reloaded/49400322|publisher=Brand Equity|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Business Standard]]'' was mixed, writing "Some parts of the book are a bit tedious, especially when the author discusses political developments in great detail and describes Hindi films to show how popular culture reflects the changed thinking of consumers. But one thing is certain - if you want to understand the Indian mindset and how consumer psychology works, the book provides the on-ground realities and challenges for brands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Majumdar|first1=Shyamal|title=The difference between affordable and cheap|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/the-difference-between-affordable-and-cheap-115100501239_1.html|publisher=Business Standard|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was the driving force behind the placement of [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]] on the [[Thames Embankment]].&lt;ref name="Waterston" /&gt;

==Background==
Born in [[Stirling]],&lt;ref name="Waterston" /&gt; he was the eldest son of  Edward Alexander of Powis, [[Clackmannanshire]], and his second wife Catherine Glas, daughter of John Glas, Provost of Stirling.&lt;ref name = Dod&gt;{{cite book | last = Dod | first = Robert P. | title = The Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland | year = 1860 | publisher = Whitaker and Co. | location = London | pages = 87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family purchased Powis House near Stirling in 1808 from James Mayne (his uncle by marriage) for £26,500. His father, a banker, had to sell Powis House in 1827 on collapse of the Stirling Banking Company.&lt;ref name="Fergusson1905" /&gt; He received his training in [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], and the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]].

In 1837 he married Eveline Marie Mitchell, daughter of Col C. C. Mitchell of the [[Royal Artillery]].&lt;ref name="Fergusson1905"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fergusson|first=Robert Menzies |title=Logie: A Parish History;|url=https://archive.org/details/logieaparishhis00ferggoog|year=1905|publisher=Alxander Gardner|location=Paisley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853 he obtained Westerton House in [[Bridge of Allan]], built in 1803 by Dr John Henderson of the [[East India Company]] (a cousin and friend). Here he became an elder of [[Logie Kirk]], walking there each Sunday.&lt;ref name="Fergusson1905" /&gt;

He died in Ryde on the [[Isle of Wight]] but is buried in Old Logie Churchyard just east of his home town of Stirling.&lt;ref name="Waterston" /&gt; The graveyard lies several hundred metres north of Logie Cemetery and the 19th century Logie Kirk.

After his death his trustees sold Westerton House to [[Edmund Pullar]].

==Military career==
In 1820, he joined the [[British East India Company]]'s army, transferring into the [[British Army]] in 1825. As [[aide-de-camp]] to the British envoy to Persia, he witnessed fighting during the war between [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and [[Russia]] in 1826 and in 1829 was present in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829]]. From 1832 to 1834, he witnessed the [[Liberal Wars|War of the Two Brothers]] in [[Portugal]], and in 1835 he took part in the [[Xhosa Wars|6th Cape Frontier War]] in South Africa as [[aide-de-camp]] and private secretary to [[Benjamin d'Urban|Sir Benjamin d'Urban]]. He was the son-in-law of [[Charles Collier Michell]], having married in Cape Town on 25 October 1837 his daughter Eveline Marie, born 16 April 1821.

In 1838, he was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] for his services.&lt;ref name = Dod/&gt; From 1841, he served in [[Canada]], among others in the staff of [[William Rowan|Sir William Rowan]]. During the [[Crimean War]], he commanded the [[14th Regiment of Foot]] as lieutenant-colonel in the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|Siege of Sevastopol]] in 1855&lt;ref name = Dod/&gt; and held an important command during the [[New Zealand Wars|Land Wars]] in [[New Zealand]] in 1862. He retired from active service in 1877 and on 1 July 1881 was given the honorary rank of general.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue= 25085|page=1215|date=17 Mar 1882}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Explorer==
On behalf of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (which he had co-founded), he conducted an exploring expedition into [[Namaqualand]] and [[Damaraland]], lasting from 8 September 1836 to 21 September 1837, in the course of which he collected rock specimens, pelts of rare animals, birdskins, weapons and implements from the [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people|Nama]], as well as drawing maps of the region and making a first list of Herero words. Subsequently, Arrowsmith made use of his data to draw a map accompanying his book of the expedition. [[Alexander Bay, Northern Cape|Alexander Bay]] on the [[Orange River]] mouth, is named after him. In 1877, he was largely responsible for the preservation and transfer of [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]] to England.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7281">This is an incomplete '''list of Canadian royal commissions''' since [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]]. [[Royal commission]]s typically consist of a panel of experts appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]-[[Queen-in-Council|in-Council]] to carry out full investigations into specific national problems.

This is a '''list of the bird species recorded in the Cook Islands'''. The avifauna of the [[Cook Islands]] include a total of 50 species, of which six are [[Endemism in birds|endemic]], one has been [[Introduced species|introduced]] by humans and three are rare or accidental. Ten species are globally threatened. Birds described from [[subfossil]] remains that became extinct as a consequence of human settlement of the islands and the introduction of exotic mammals include the [[Mangaia rail]] (''Gallirallus ripleyi'') and the [[Mangaia crake]] (''Porzana rua'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Steadman, D. W. |year=1986 |title= Two new species of rails (Aves: Rallidae) from Mangaia, Southern Cook Islands. |journal=Pacific Science |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=27–43 |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list's [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of ''[[The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World]]'', 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for the Cook Islands.

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. Not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species.

*(A) '''[[Vagrancy (biology)|Accidental]]''' - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Cook Islands
*(E) '''[[Endemic]]''' - a species endemic to the Cook Islands
*(Ex) '''[[Extinct]]''' - a species extinct to the Cook Islands
*(I) '''[[Introduced species|Introduced]]''' - a species introduced to the Cook Islands as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions

==Shearwaters and petrels==
'''Order''': [[Procellariiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Procellariidae]]

The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized "true petrels", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.

*[[Hall's giant petrel]], ''Macronectes halli'' (A)
*[[Cape petrel]], ''Daption capense''
*[[Tahiti petrel]], ''Pterodroma rostrata''
*[[Phoenix petrel]], ''Pterodroma alba'' (A)

==Austral storm petrels==
'''Order''': [[Procellariiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Oceanitidae]]

The [[austral storm petrel]]s are relatives of the [[petrel]]s and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on [[plankton]]ic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes [[bat]]-like.

*[[White-bellied storm petrel]], ''Fregetta grallaria''
*[[Polynesian storm petrel]], ''Nesofregetta fuliginosa''

==Tropicbirds==
'''Order''': [[Phaethontiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Phaethontidae]]

[[Tropicbird]]s are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings. 

*[[Red-tailed tropicbird]], ''Phaethon rubricauda''
*[[White-tailed tropicbird]], ''Phaethon lepturus''

==Boobies and gannets==
'''Order''': [[Suliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Sulidae]]

The sulids comprise the [[gannet]]s and [[Booby|boobies]]. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.

*[[Masked booby]], ''Sula dactylatra''
*[[Red-footed booby]], ''Sula sula''
*[[Brown booby]], ''Sula leucogaster''

==Frigatebirds==
'''Order''': [[Suliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Fregatidae]]

[[Frigatebird]]s are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black and white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.

*[[Great frigatebird]], ''Fregata minor''
*[[Lesser frigatebird]], ''Fregata ariel''

==Bitterns, herons and egrets==
'''Order''': [[Pelecaniformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Ardeidae]]

The family Ardeidae contains the [[bittern]]s, [[heron]]s and [[egret]]s. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills.

*[[Pacific reef heron]], ''Egretta sacra''

==Ducks, geese and swans==
'''Order''': [[Anseriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Anatidae]]

Anatidae includes the [[duck]]s and most duck-like waterfowl, such as [[Goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating.

*[[Mallard]], ''Anas platyrhynchos'' (I)
*[[Pacific black duck]], ''Anas superciliosa''
*[[Northern pintail]], ''Anas acuta''

==Plovers and lapwings==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Charadriidae]]

The family Charadriidae includes the [[plover]]s, [[dotterel]]s and [[lapwing]]s. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.

*[[Pacific golden plover]], ''Pluvialis fulva''
*[[Black-bellied plover]], ''Pluvialis squatarola''

==Sandpipers and allies==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Scolopacidae]]

Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the [[sandpiper]]s, [[curlew]]s, [[godwit]]s, [[Tringa|shanks]], [[tattler (bird)|tattler]]s, [[woodcock]]s, [[snipe]]s, [[dowitcher]]s and [[phalarope]]s. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.

*[[Bristle-thighed curlew]], ''Numenius tahitiensis''
*[[Grey-tailed tattler]], ''Tringa brevipes''
*[[Wandering tattler]], ''Tringa incana''
*[[Ruddy turnstone]], ''Arenaria interpres''

'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Laridae]]

Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds, the [[gull]]s, [[tern]]s, and [[skimmer]]s. Gulls are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years.

*[[Black-naped tern]], ''Sterna sumatrana''
*[[Common tern]], ''Sterna hirundo''
*[[Sooty tern]], ''Onychoprion fuscatus''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5857">There are several newspapers on the [[Faroe Islands]], ranging from single man publications about local news to widely distributed publications reporting on international events and business news.

==''Dimmalætting''==
''[[Dimmalætting]]'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]] for "dawn") is the oldest and largest newspaper of the [[Faroe Islands]] and is based in [[Tórshavn]].

The first edition of the ''Dimma'', as it is commonly known, appeared (after a test issue on December 8, 1877) on January 5, 1878. Today it has a print run of 8,500 copies (in 1991 it was 13,300) and appears five days weekly. As an answer to competing papers, the Tuesday edition has been delivered free of charge to all households since April 5, 2005.

Since the founding of the [[Union Party (Faroe Islands)|Unionist Party]] in 1906, ''Dimma'' was the party paper, but it has since declared itself independent 1995. However, as of 2005, the chief has still been an automatic member of the Unionist party leadership.

The name ''Dimmalætting'' combines the word ''dimmi'' (darkness) and ''lætting'', from the verb ''lætta'' (leave). ''Dimmið lættir'' means "it is becoming daytime", or literally, "the darkness is dwindling". The paper's name comes from [[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb]], the creator of the modern orthography of Faroese.

The [[Danish language|Danish]] name for the paper was the ''Amtstidene for Færøerne'' ("official paper for the Faroese"), and its Faroese name was printed in small letters. In its early years, the paper was only published in the Danish language.  Then, from 1910 to 1947, it was printed in both languages, and in the years since 1947, Faroese has dominated.

Until 1911, when a Wednesday edition began, the paper only appeared on Saturdays. In the 1920s, the paper expanded to six pages from the previous four. After 1970, the page count rose to eight or more. A third edition was added, and from September 1996, it has appeared five times a week from Tuesday to Saturday. In November 2004, the days were changed to Monday to Friday. Since the middle of March 2005, it has appeared in a smaller format.

The newspaper went bankrupt and folded in October 2013.

== ''Local.fo'' ==
''[[Local.fo]]'' is the only English-language news media in the Faroe Islands reporting Faroese news.

== ''Norðlýsið'' ==
[[File:Norðlýsið nr 1 16-04-1915.jpg|thumb|''Norðlýsið'']]
''[[Norðlýsið]]'' is a Faroese newspaper and in recent years also a newsportal, which has a mainly local northern islands focus on its news, with its base in [[Klaksvík]].

== ''Oyggjatíðindi'' ==
''[[Oyggjatíðindi]]'' was a Faroese newspaper, and since 2011 it is an internet newsportal.&lt;ref name="Oyggjatíðindi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oyggjatidindi.com/nu+kunnu+blodini+keypast+a+netinum.html|title=Nú kunnu bløðini keypast á netinum|last=Klein|first=Dan|date=19 September 2011|publisher=Oyggjatíðindi|language=Faroese|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written mainly by one man, Faroese reporter [[Dan Klein (journalist)|Dan Klein]].

== ''Sosialurin'' ==
''[[Sosialurin]]'' is a Faroese newspaper, founded in 1927. Originally it was associated with the [[Social Democratic Party (Faroe)|Social Democrats]], but in 2006 the political party sold their part of the shares. The newspaper in partnership with Føroya Tele, a Faroese telecom, operates the website [http://www.portal.fo Portal.fo].

==''Vikublaðið''==
''[[Vikublaðið]]'' is a free Faroese weekly newspaper. In a national survey, it came out as the most read newspaper on the islands.

==''Vinnuvitan''==
''[[Vinnuvitan]]'' was the only [[newspaper]] on the [[Faroe Islands]] that dealt with business issues exclusively. It now exists only on the internet.&lt;ref name="About Vinnuvitan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vinnuvitan.fo/um-vinnuvitan/|title=Um Vinnuvitan|last=Reyðberg|first=Eyðfinn|publisher=Vinnuvitan|language=Faroese|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in December 2004. It was originally published every other week, but later the newspaper had grown in size and popularity and was published every Thursday for some years. In addition to the newspaper, ''Vinnuvitan'' was also a publishing house, releasing a small number of books each year, including ''[[Skipalistin]]'' and ''[[Okkara Sangbók]]''.

''Vinnuvitan'' was also the founder and organizer of the annual [[Faroese Advertising Awards]] (Kolan). It was chosen Best Achievement of 2006 (Ársins Átak) by the [[Faroese House of Industry]].&lt;ref name="Ársins átak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industry.fo/Default.aspx?ID=32&amp;PID=4786&amp;Action=1&amp;NewsId=765|title=Ársins Virki og Ársins Átak verður valt 28. september|date=10 September 2012|publisher=Industry.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mongefossen''' ({{lang-en|Monge falls}}) is a [[waterfall]] in the [[Rauma Municipality]] of [[Møre og Romsdal]] county, [[Norway]].  It is located near the [[European route E136]] highway and the [[Rauma River]], which it flows into.  There is some dispute as to the height, but it is generally listed at {{convert|773|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{wwdb name|id=7|name=Mongefossen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As is the case with many of Norway's waterfalls, it has been targeted for [[hydroelectric]] power, which results in a greatly diminished water flow during the summer tourist season.&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Mongefossen|title=Mongefossen|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mongefossen also holds the distinction as being the highest waterfall in the world which may be viewed from a [[Train station|railway station]] on the [[Rauma Line]], on the north side between the villages of Flatmark and Marstein.

'''Mount Liamuiga''' is a {{Convert|3792|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[stratovolcano]] which forms the western part of the island of [[Saint Kitts]]. The peak is the highest point on the island of Saint Kitts, in the federation of [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], and in the entire British [[Leeward Islands]], as well as one of the tallest peaks in the eastern [[Caribbean]] [[archipelago]].  The peak is topped by a {{Convert|0.6|mi|km|0|adj=on}} wide [[summit crater]], which contained a shallow [[crater lake]] until 1959.  As of 2006, the crater lake had re-formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Avery | first = Roberta | title = Trek to top of `Mount Misery' is a picnic – even in the rain | publisher =[[Toronto Star]] | date = 2006-12-21 | url = https://www.thestar.com/Travel/article/163003 | accessdate =  2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last verified eruptions from the volcano were about 1,800 years ago, while reports of possible eruptions in 1692 and 1843 are considered uncertain.

Mount Liamuiga was formerly named '''Mount Misery'''.  The renaming took place on the date of St. Kitts' independence, September 19, 1983.  However, many older citizens still refer to it as Mount Misery. The name ''Liamuiga'' is derived from the [[Kalinago]] name for the entire island of St. Kitts, which means, "fertile land."

The mountain sides are covered in farmland and small villages up to the {{Convert|1500|ft|m|-1|adj=on}} height, after which lush tropical [[rainforest]]s drape the slopes until [[cloud forest]] takes over at {{Convert|3000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}}. Many tours and guided hikes are organized to the peak's summit and surrounding rainforests, usually starting from Belmont Estate in the village of St. Paul's. From the summit, the views are outstanding, including the entire island and the beautiful [[Caribbean Sea]], as well as the neighbouring islands of [[Saba]], [[Statia]], [[St. Barths]], [[St. Martin]], [[Antigua]], and [[Nevis]].

The '''Murray–Darling basin''' is a large geographical area in the interior of [[Geography of Australia|southeastern]] [[Australia]]. Its name is derived from its two major rivers, the [[Murray River]] and the [[Darling River]]. The basin, which drains around one-seventh of the [[Australia]]n land mass,&lt;ref name="awr"/&gt; is one of the most significant agricultural areas in Australia.  It spans most of the states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[the Australian Capital Territory]], and parts of the states of [[Queensland]] (lower third) and [[South Australia]] (southeastern corner). The basin is {{convert|3375|km|mi}} in length, with the Murray River being {{convert|2508|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.

Most of the {{convert|1061469|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} [[Drainage basin|basin]] is flat, low-lying and far inland, and receives little direct rainfall. The many [[river]]s it contains tend to be long and slow-flowing, and carry a volume of water that is large only by Australian standards.

==The original inhabitants==
The basin was once home to a large number of [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] people whose traditional lifestyle and cultures were gradually destroyed by the arrival of Europeans. In addition, some were killed by English settlers. Although some tribes organized resistance, such as the Maraura, whose territory lay around the Rufus River above [[Renmark, South Australia|Renmark]] and the Tanganekald near [[The Coorong]], they were eventually either killed, exiled, or succumbed to disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of the Murray|editor=G. V. Lawrence and Graeme Kinross Smith|author=H. A. Lindsay|chapter=Ch. 11: Aborigines in the Murray Valley|publisher=Rigby Ltd.|date=1975|ISBN=0 85179 917 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Native fauna==
The Murray–Darling basin is home to many native animal species. The true numbers may not be known, but a fairly confident estimate has been made of these animals and the current status of their population. Among the aboriginal fauna in the region, the study found {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} that there were:

* 80 species of mammals, with 62 extinct and 10 endangered
* 55 species of frogs, with 18 endangered
* 46 species of snakes, with five endangered
* 5 species of tortoises, with none endangered
* 34 species of fish, with up to half either threatened or of conservation significance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Murray-Darling Basin Authority|title=Proposed Murray Darling Basin Plan|date=August 2012|url=http://download.mdba.gov.au/altered-PBP/APBP-Proposed-Basin-Plan-20120806.pdf|accessdate=7 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113212624/http://download.mdba.gov.au/altered-PBP/APBP-Proposed-Basin-Plan-20120806.pdf|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records show that the previous abundances of fish provided a reliable food source.&lt;ref name=Wohl&gt;{{citation|last=Wohl|first=Ellen E.|title= A World of Rivers: Environmental Change on Ten of the World's Great Rivers|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bountiful fish became concentrated when the early stages of a flood left shallow water across the floodplain.&lt;ref name=Wohl/&gt; Today, roughly 24 native freshwater fish and another 15-25 marine and estuarine species are existent in the basin, a very low biodiversity. &lt;ref name=Wohl/&gt;

==Introduced species==
Four varieties of [[carp]] were used to stock up fish dams. Since then they have made their way into the river systems, where they spread quite quickly. Human introduction, possibly by anglers using small carp illegally as live bait has also increased their distribution.&lt;ref name="giac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fisheries/pests-diseases/freshwater-pests/species/carp/general-information#How-did-carp-get-here? |title=General information about carp - biology, ecology and impacts |publisher=New South Wales Department of Primary Industires |accessdate=10 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These fish are very mobile, breed rapidly and can survive in very shallow water and through long periods of very low dissolved oxygen content.

Carp are a problem because they feed by sucking gravel from the riverbed and taking all the edible material off it, before returning the rest to the water. This stirs up all the sediment, reducing the quality of the water. A project for developing [[daughterless carp]] shows promise for eliminating carp from the river system.

[[Cane toad]]s have entered the upper reaches of the Darling Basin and there are several reports of individuals being found further down the system.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, D., Mazzer, T.M. and Ellis, M.V.  (2004).  Herpetofauna of the Darling Basin.  In: The Darling (Eds. R. Breckwoldt, R. Boden and J. Andrew) (Murray-Darling Basin Commission, Canberra).&lt;/ref&gt; Cane toads compete with native amphibians and are toxic to native carnivores.

==Physiography==
This area is one of the physiographic provinces of the larger [[East Australian basins]] division, and encompasses the smaller [[Naracoorte Platform]] and [[Encounter Shelf]] physiographic sections.

Total water flow in the Murray–Darling basin 1885 to the present has averaged around {{convert|24,000|GL|hm3 acre·ft|sigfig=2|lk=on}} per year. This is the lowest rate of the world's major river systems.&lt;ref name="awr"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia's Water Resources: From use to management |last=Pigram |first=John J. |year=2007 |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Collingwood, Victoria |isbn=978-0-643-09442-0 |page=160&amp;mdash;162 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 6.0 percent of Australia's total rainwater falls into the basin.&lt;ref name="rivertourism"&gt;{{cite book |title=River Tourism |last=Prideaux |first=Bruce |editor1-first=Bruce |editor1-last=Prideaux |editor2-first=Malcolm |editor2-last=Cooper |chapter=River Heritage: the Murray–Darling River |year=2009 |publisher=CAB International |location=Wallingford, United Kingdom |isbn=1-84593-468-7 |page=167 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EpEvuRK4CHUC |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most years only half of this quantity reaches the sea and in dry years much less. Estimated total annual flows for the basin have ranged from {{convert|5,000|GL|hm3 acre·ft|sigfig=2}} in 1902 to {{convert|57,000|GL|hm3 acre·ft|sigfig=2}} in 1956{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. Despite the magnitude of the basin, the hydrology of the streams within it is quite varied. 

These waters are divided into four types:&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;Brown, J. A. H. (John Alexander Henstridge); ''Australia's Surface Water Resources''. {{ISBN|0-644-02617-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Darling River|Darling]] and [[Lachlan River|Lachlan]] basins. These have extremely variable flows from year to year, with the smallest annual flow being typically as little as ''1 percent'' of the long-term mean and the largest often more than ten times the mean. Periods of zero flow in most rivers can extend to months and in the drier parts (Warrego, Paroo and Lower Darling basins) to years.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; Flows in these rivers are not strongly seasonal. In the northern regions the majority of floods occur in the summer from monsoonal penetration. For most of the Darling and Lachlan catchments it is typical to see high or low flows begin in winter and extend to the following autumn (see [[El Niño]]). High water extraction rates for irrigation and mining have heavily compromised these rivers.
* The southwestern basins ([[Campaspe River|Campaspe]], [[Loddon River|Loddon]], [[Avoca River|Avoca]], [[Wimmera River|Wimmera]]). These have a marked winter rainfall maximum and relatively lower precipitation variability than the Lachlan or Darling. However, the age and infertility of the soils mean that run-off ratios are exceedingly low (for comparison, ''around a tenth that of a [[Europe]]an or [[North America]]n catchment with a similar climate''&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, T.A. and Finlayson, B.L.; ''Global Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges''; pp. 86–98 {{ISBN|3-923381-27-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus, variability of runoff is very high and most of the terminal lakes found in these basins very frequently dry up. Almost all runoff occurs in the winter and spring and, in the absence of large dams for regulation, these rivers are often seasonally dry during summer and autumn.
* A number of small catchments in South Australia, of which the largest are the Angas River flowing through [[Strathalbyn, South Australia|Strathalbyn]] and the [[Finniss River (South Australia)|Finniss River]] further west, are  part of the Murray–Darling Basin. These catchments lead to Lake Alexandrina, one of the lakes at the end of the Murray system. The Angas River is often dry in summer because of high levels of water extraction. The Finniss River has permanent flow which previously went into Lake Alexandrina but now has been cut off by a [[weir]]. The Finniss now fills the Goolwa Channel for recreational boating.
* The [[Murray River|Murray]], [[Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee]] and [[Goulburn River|Goulburn]] (except the [[Broken River (Victoria)|Broken River]] which resembles the southwestern basins) Basins. Because these catchments have headwaters in alpine country with relatively young [[Histosol|peaty]] [[soil]]s, the runoff ratios are much higher than in other parts of the basin. Consequently, although gross precipitation variability is ''no lower'' than in the Lachlan or Darling basins, runoff variability is markedly lower than in other parts of the basin. Typically these rivers never cease to flow and the smallest annual flow is typically around 30 percent of the long-term mean and the largest around three times the mean. In most cases the flow peaks very strongly with the spring snow melt and troughs in mid-autumn.

The two principal rivers of the basin, the Murray and Darling, bring water from the high ranges of the east and carry it west then south through long flat and dry inland areas.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, Jessica K. 2009. Murray River country: an ecological dialogue with traditional owners. Canberra: Aboriginal Studies Press. &lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these waters are subject to major diversions for municipal drinking supplies and irrigated agriculture that began in the 1890s. &lt;ref name=Wohl/&gt; Currently, 4 major reservoirs, 14 lock and weir structures, and five coastal barrages interject the water flowing down the Murray-Darling. &lt;ref name=Wohl/&gt; Of the approximately {{convert|13,000|GL|hm3 acre·ft|sigfig=3}} of flow in the basin, which studies have shown to be divertible, {{convert|11,500|GL|hm3 acre·ft|sigfig=3}} are removed for irrigation, industrial use, and domestic supply. Agricultural irrigation accounts for about 95 percent of the water removed,&lt;ref name="awr"/&gt; including for the growing of [[rice]] and [[cotton]]. This extraction is highly controversial among scientists in Australia, regarding the agriculture industry's high water use in a region extremely short of water (as much due to exceptionally low run-off coefficients as to low rainfall).&lt;ref&gt;Government, politics, power and policy in Australia / [editors] Dennis Woodward, Andrew Parkin, John  Summers.&lt;/ref&gt; These extensive irrigation systems require a reliable supply of water, not the unpredictable flows that characterize the Murray-Darling. &lt;ref name=Wohl/&gt; These structures and irrigation implements were ideal when there was a steady flow of water.&lt;ref name=Richter&gt;{{citation|last=Richter|first=Brian D.|date=2014|title=Chasing water: a guide for moving from scarcity to sustainability}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during “the Big Dry,” as the early [[2000s Australian drought|2000s drought]] came to be known, Australian farmers experienced a scarcity unlike ever before. The drought was so severe that numerous rivers and streams such as the Murray-Darling stopped flowing.&lt;ref name=Richter/&gt; The basin contains more than 30,000 [[wetland]]s.&lt;ref name="iwm"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Connell |first=Daniel |date= |title=Irrigation, water markets and sustainability in Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin |journal=Agriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia |volume=4 |pages=133–139 |doi=10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.03.016 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210784315000790 |accessdate=10 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eleven of these are protected under the [[Ramsar Convention]] of Wetlands of International Importance.

The rivers listed below comprise the Murray–Darling basin and its direct significant tributaries, with elevations of their [[confluence]] with the downstream river. The tributary with the highest elevation is [[Swampy Plain River]] that rises in the Snowy Mountains, below [[Mount Kosciuszko]] at an elevation of {{convert|2120|m}}, and ends merging with the Murray River, descending {{convert|1860|m}}.

==Management==
The basin covers five states and territory governments, who according to the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]], are responsible for managing water resources. The River Murray Commission was established in 1917.&lt;ref name="awr"/&gt; Under the River Murray Waters Agreement, which never included Queensland despite the state containing about a quarter of the basin, the Commission's role was only as an advisory body with no authority for the enforcement of provisions. For a long time the Commission was only concerned with water quantity until [[Salinity in Australia|salinity]] became a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdba.gov.au/basin-plan-roll-out/water-quality-and-salinity |title=Murray- Darling river: Water quality management|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to minor reforms in 1982 in which [[water quality]] became part of the Commission's responsibilities.&lt;ref name="awr"/&gt; However, it was soon recognised that a new organisational structure which considered the national perspective was needed for effective management.

The Murray–Darling Basin Agreement was first adopted in 1985 but it wasn't until 1993 that its full legal status was enacted.&lt;ref name="awr"/&gt; The Agreement led to the creation of a number of new organisations under what is known as the Murray-Darling Basin Initiative. These included the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council and the Murray Darling Basin Commission.

===The Murray–Darling Basin plan===

The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was signed off by Tony Burke, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities on 22 November 2012, and passed disallowance period in the Australian Parliament on the 19 March 2013. Following is the history leading up to this significant occasion in the history of Australian water reform.

====History====
In October 2010, in response to the [[2000s Australian drought]], the [[Murray–Darling Basin Authority]] released a draft plan to secure the long-term [[ecological health]] of the Murray–Darling Basin. This entailed cutting existing water allocations and increasing [[environmental flows]].&lt;ref name="cewa"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2010/10/12/3036291.htm |title=MDBA Chair explains water allocation cuts |author=Joseph Thomsen  |accessdate=17 October 2010 |date=12 October 2010 |work=[[ABC Goulburn Murray]] |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt; The document is officially titled the ''Guide to the Proposed Murray–Darling Basin Plan''.

The Basin Plan is designed to set environmentally sustainable limits on the quantities of water that may be taken from Basin [[water resource]]s, to set Basin-wide environmental, [[water quality]] and [[Salinity in Australia|salinity]] objectives, to develop efficient [[water trading]] regimes across the Basin, to set requirements for state water resource plans and to improve water security for all Basin users.&lt;ref name="smr"&gt;{{citation|url=http://download.mdba.gov.au/FactSheet_Murrumbidgee.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410012341/http://download.mdba.gov.au/FactSheet_Murrumbidgee.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2013|title=Summary of Murrumbidgee Region From the Guide to the proposed Basin Plan|publisher=Australian Government|author=Murray-Darling Basin Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also intends to minimise social and economic impacts whilst achieving the plan's environmental outcomes.&lt;ref name="jsf"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/water-issues/joyce-signals-fight-over-plan-for-murraydarling-basin-20100530-wnj1.html |title=Joyce signals fight over plan for Murray–Darling Basin |first=Tom|last= Arup |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107055535/http://www.smh.com.au/environment/water-issues/joyce-signals-fight-over-plan-for-murraydarling-basin-20100530-wnj1.html|archivedate=7 November 2012 |date=31 May 2010 |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=Fairfax Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the release of the ''Guide to the Proposed Murray–Darling Basin Plan'' there have been a number of protests and voiced concerns about the plan in rural towns that the MDBA  visited to present the plan to consultation meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/15/3039240.htm?section=justin|title=Tractor convoy as SA irrigators protest|date=15 October 2010|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|website=ABC News|archivedate=31 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031221858/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/15/3039240.htm?section=justin}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 5,000 people attended a MDBA meeting in Griffith where Griffith Mayor, Mike Neville, said the plan would "obliterate" [[Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee]] valley communities.&lt;ref name="GriffithMeeting"&gt;{{cite news|title=Griffith irrigators vent anger|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2010/10/21/248661_water.html|accessdate=21 October 2010|newspaper=Weekly Times|date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups also echo this feeling, such as the Victorian Farmers Federation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vff.org.au/newsite/policy_issues/murray_darling_basin_plan.php VFF Declares War!: Stop the MDBA plundering] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120917131741/http://www.vff.org.au/newsite/policy_issues/murray_darling_basin_plan.php |date=17 September 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Wine Group Growers' Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wgga.com.au/news/pdf/WGGA%20Basin%20Plan%20Response%20-%2013%20Oct%202010.pdf Federal Government urged "not to forget people" in Basin Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113325/http://www.wgga.com.au/news/pdf/WGGA%20Basin%20Plan%20Response%20-%2013%20Oct%202010.pdf |date=6 July 2011 }}.

New legal advice from the lawyers of the Federal Government is changing the plan. The Government's interpretation is that the plan must give equal weight to the environmental, social, and economic impacts of proposed cuts to irrigation.

Environmentalists and South Australian irrigators, at the end of the river in South Australia, say that the authority should stick to its original figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jason|last=Om|date=27 October 2010|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/26/3048954.htm?site=news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112070201/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/26/3048954.htm?site=news|archivedate=12 November 2012|title= SA irrigators back Murray–Darling cuts|website=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, a parliamentary inquiry into the economic impacts of the plan was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Lee|date=18 October 2010|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/16/3040193.htm|title=Murray authority chairman faces uphill battle|website=ABC News|archivedate=22 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222051132/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/16/3040193.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2010 the Water Minister, Tony Burke, played down the prospect of a High Court challenge to the Murray–Darling Basin plan, as confusion continued over new legal advice released by the Government. In response to community concerns that the Murray–Darling Basin Authority had put environmental issues first over social and economic needs, Burke released new advice on the requirements of the Water Act. Burke stated that the Act does allow for the authority to "optimise" the needs of all three areas, but constitutional lawyer, George Williams, had cast doubts over the interpretation of the laws, stating it could be subject to a legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Emma |last=Rodgers|date=28 October 2010|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/28/3050494.htm?section=justin|title=Burke plays down challenge to basin plan|website=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|archivedate=30 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030071236/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/28/3050494.htm?section=justin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MDBA announced in November 2010 that it might be forced to push back the release of its final plan for the river system until early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kerrin|last=Binnie|date=2 November 2010|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/01/3054328.htm?section=justin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104043813/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/01/3054328.htm?section=justin|archivedate=4 November 2010|title=Basin authority flags delay to final plan|website=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The then MDBA chairman, [[Mike Taylor (public servant)|Mike Taylor]], reassured the public meeting that more work is being done to look at how the proposed cuts would affect regional communities. He stated; "Importantly, we want to make sure the social and economic impacts—which under any sort of scenario is very significant—were fully teased out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=4 November 2010|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/04/3057036.htm?section=justin|title=Water cuts treat farmers as 'second-class citizens|website=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|archivedate=4 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104222500/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/04/3057036.htm?section=justin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor resigned as he allegedly believed that the overriding principle should be the environmental outcome which was in conflict with the Gillard Government and following a period of sustained criticism of the Authority and the implementation of the proposed draft basin plan.&lt;ref name="ABC-resign"&gt;{{cite news   | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-12-07/murray-darling-boss-resigns/2365224?section=justin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112040519/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-12-07/murray-darling-boss-resigns/2365224?section=justin|archivedate=12 November 2012 | title = Murray–Darling boss resigns   | last = Rodgers|first= Emma   | website = ABC News   | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation

In late May 2012, the revised plan was forwarded to state water ministers.&lt;ref name="mdpdts"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rural/news/content/201205/s3512350.htm |title=Murray-Darling plan delivered to states |author=Anna Vidot and rural reporters |accessdate=29 May 2012 |date=28 May 2012 |website=ABC Rural |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529013820/http://www.abc.net.au/rural/news/content/201205/s3512350.htm|archivedate=29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not alter the recommendation to cut {{convert|2,750|GL|km3 acre·ft|sigfig=3}} of water entitlements.

Following much negotiation between the Commonwealth and State governments and numerous submissions from interested stakeholders and the community, the Basin Plan became law in November 2012 and can now be implemented.

====Sustainability and risks====
Although the Murray-Darling Basin Plan (MDBP) is a {{According to whom|positive step|date=February 2018}} towards sustainability the measures keep a significant risk of human activities exacerbating the drought risk (see [[River Murray]] which has only dried up twice since records began{{Citation needed|reason=Needs a reference as the definition of dried up has to be clarified as to where, how long, and under what assumptions|date=February 2018}}). The Environmental Water Requirement found that a reduction in allocations of {{convert|7,600|GL|km3 acre·ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} (per year) is required to be certain that the river systems would maintain their health{{Citation needed|reason=This number has come from some document it would help to know which one|date=February 2018}}. However objectors {{Like whom|date=February 2018}} cite socio-economic impacts of major cutbacks to the widescale farming (and in some areas wine-growing) in the basin, and conclude that within plans for population growth, particularly in times of drought, may be a need for sustainable water transportation from new extraction from rivers in the wettest part of the country, the [[Cape York Peninsula]] or more [[water desalination|desalination]].

'''Neil Alden Armstrong''' (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American [[astronaut]] and [[aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]] who was the [[Apollo 11#Lunar surface operations|first person to walk on the Moon]]. He was also a [[United States Naval Aviator|naval aviator]], [[test pilot]], and [[university professor]].

A graduate of [[Purdue University]], Armstrong studied aeronautical engineering with his college tuition paid for by the [[U.S. Navy]] under the [[James L. Holloway, Jr.#Holloway Plan|Holloway Plan]]. He became a [[midshipman]] in 1949, and a naval aviator the following year. He saw action in the [[Korean War]], flying the [[Grumman F9F Panther]] from the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}}. In September 1951, he was hit by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]] while making a low bombing run, and was forced to bail out.  After the war, he completed his bachelor's degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) [[Armstrong Flight Research Center|High-Speed Flight Station]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]]. He was the project pilot on [[Century Series]] fighters and flew the [[North American X-15]] seven times. He was also a participant in the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s [[Man in Space Soonest]] and [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]] [[human spaceflight]] programs.

Armstrong joined the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]] in the [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|second group]], which was selected in 1962. He made his first spaceflight as commander of [[Gemini 8]] in March 1966, becoming [[NASA]]'s first civilian astronaut to fly in space. During this mission with pilot [[David Scott]], he performed the first [[Spacecraft docking and berthing mechanisms|docking]] of two [[spacecraft]]; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to remove a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster. During training for Armstrong's second and last spaceflight as commander of [[Apollo 11]], he had to eject from the [[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]] moments before a fiery crash.

In July 1969, Armstrong and Apollo 11 [[Lunar Module]] pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]] performed the first manned [[Moon landing]], and spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] remained in lunar orbit in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]]. When Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]. President [[Jimmy Carter]] presented Armstrong with the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]] in 1978, and Armstrong and his former crewmates received a [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 2009.

After he resigned from NASA in 1971, Armstrong taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the [[University of Cincinnati]] until 1979. He served on the [[Apollo 13]] accident investigation, and on the [[Rogers Commission Report|Rogers Commission]], which investigated the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]]. He acted as a spokesman for several businesses, and appeared in advertising for the automotive brand [[Chrysler]] starting in January 1979.

== Early years ==
Armstrong was born on August 5, 1930, near [[Wapakoneta, Ohio]],{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=49–50}} to Stephen Koenig Armstrong and Viola Louise {{nee}} Engel. He was of German, Scottish and Scots-Irish ancestry,{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=13, 20}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Giant Leap For An Ulsterman |date=Aug 28, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/a-giant-leap-for-an-ulsterman-tributes-to-neil-armstrong-the-astronaut-who-was-first-to-walk-on-the-moon-28785887.html |access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had a younger sister, June, and a younger brother, Dean. His father worked as an [[auditor]] for the [[Government of Ohio|Ohio state government]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neil Armstrong grants rare interview to accountants organization |publisher=CBC News |date=May 24, 2012 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/neil-armstrong-grants-rare-interview-to-accountants-organization-1.1289392 |accessdate=April 8, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107163955/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/neil-armstrong-grants-rare-interview-to-accountants-organization-1.1289392 |archivedate=January 7, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the family moved around the state repeatedly, living in sixteen towns over the next fourteen years.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=29}} Armstrong's love for flying grew during this time, having started early when his father took his two-year-old son to the [[National Air Races|Cleveland Air Races]]. When he was five or six, he experienced his first airplane flight in [[Warren, Ohio]], when he and his father took a ride in a [[Ford Trimotor]], also known as the "Tin Goose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Project Apollo: Astronaut Biographies |publisher=NASA |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/astrobios.htm#Armstrong |access-date=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428105817/http://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/astrobios.htm#Armstrong |archivedate=April 28, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=45|ps=.  "According to a volunteer group in Warren. Ohio that had worked through the 2000s to turn the Warren Airport into a historical exhibit, the date of Neil's inaugural; flight was July 26, 1936.

His father's last move was in 1944, back to Wapakoneta. Armstrong attended [[Blume High School]], and took flying lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=49–50}} He earned a student flight certificate on his sixteenth birthday, then [[First solo flight|soloed]] in August, all before he had a driver's license.{{sfn|Koestler-Grack|2010|p=14}} He was active in the [[Scouting in Ohio|Boy Scouts]] and earned the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].{{sfn|Hansen|2012|p=38}} As an adult, he was recognized by the [[Boy Scouts of America]] with its [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] and [[Silver Buffalo Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23385802/the_morning_call/|title=1st Man on the Moon Gets National Eagle Award|last1=Airgood|first1=Glenn|newspaper=The Morning Call|location=Allentown, Pennsylvania|date=February 16, 1973|page=5|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scouting.org/awards/silver-buffalo/previous-winners/1979-1970/|title=Silver Buffalo Award Winners 1979–1970|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|access-date=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 18, 1969, while flying toward the [[Moon]], Armstrong greeted the Scouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote="I'd like to say hello to all my fellow Scouts and Scouters at [[Farragut State Park]] in [[Idaho]] having a [[National Scout jamboree (Boy Scouts of America)|National Jamboree]] there this week; and Apollo 11 would like to send them best wishes".

In 1947, at age 17, Armstrong began studying [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]] at [[Purdue University]]. He was the second person in his family to attend college. He was also accepted to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), but an uncle who had attended MIT dissuaded him from attending, telling him that it was not necessary to go all the way to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], for a good education. His college tuition was paid for under the [[James L. Holloway, Jr.#Holloway Plan|Holloway Plan]]. Successful applicants committed to two years of study, followed by two years of flight training and one year of service in the U.S. Navy as an aviator, then completion of the final two years of their [[bachelor's degree]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=55–56}} He did not take courses in naval science, nor did he join the [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] at Purdue.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=58}}

Armstrong's call-up from the Navy arrived on January 26, 1949, requiring him to report to [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] in [[Florida]] for flight training with class 5-49. After passing the medical examinations, he became a [[midshipman]] on February 24, 1949.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=68–69}} Flight training was conducted in a [[North American T-6 Texan|North American SNJ trainer]], in which he soloed on September 9, 1949.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=71}} On March 2, 1950, he made his first [[aircraft carrier]] landing on the {{USS|Cabot|CVL-28|6}}, an achievement he considered comparable to his first solo flight.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=71}} He was then sent to [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]] in Texas for training on the [[Grumman F8F Bearcat]], culminating in a carrier landing on the {{USS|Wright|CVL-49|6}}. On August 16, 1950, Armstrong was informed by letter that he was a fully qualified [[United States Naval Aviator|naval aviator]]. His mother and sister attended his graduation ceremony on August 23, 1950.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=76–79}}

Armstrong's assignment was to Fleet Aircraft Service Squadron 7 (FASRON 7) at [[Naval Air Station North Island|NAS San Diego]] (now known as NAS North Island). On November 27, 1950, he was assigned to [[VF-51]], an all-jet squadron, becoming its youngest officer, and made his first flight in a jet, a [[Grumman F9F Panther]], on January 5, 1951. He was promoted to [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] on June 5, 1951, and made his first jet carrier landing on {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}} two days later. On June 28, 1951, ''Essex'' had set sail for Korea, with VF-51 aboard to act as [[ground-attack aircraft]]. VF-51 flew ahead to [[Naval Air Station Barbers Point]] in Hawaii, where it conducted fighter-bomber training before rejoining the ship at the end of July.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=79–85}}

On August 29, 1951, Armstrong saw action in the [[Korean War]] as an escort for a photo [[reconnaissance]] plane over [[Songjin]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=90}} Five days later, on September 3, he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon-ni, west of [[Wonsan]]. Making a low bombing run at {{convert|350|mph|-1|abbr=on}}, Armstrong's F9F Panther was hit by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]]. While trying to regain control, he collided with a pole at a height of {{convert|20|ft|0}}, which sliced off {{convert|3|ft|0}} of the Panther's right wing.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=92–93}}

Armstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory, but due to the loss of the [[aileron]], [[ejection seat|ejection]] was his only safe option. He intended to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters, but his parachute was blown back over land. A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked him up; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of his aircraft, F9F-2 BuNo ''125122''.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=95–96}}

In all, Armstrong flew 78 missions over Korea for a total of 121 hours in the air, a third of them in January 1952, with the final mission on March 5, 1952. Of 492 U.S. Navy personnel killed in the Korean War, 27 of them were from the ''Essex'' on this war cruise. Armstrong received the [[Air Medal]] for 20 combat missions, two [[5/16 inch star|gold stars]] for the next 40, the [[Korean Service Medal]] and Engagement Star,{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=112}} the [[National Defense Service Medal]] and the [[United Nations Korea Medal]]. His regular commission was terminated on February 25, 1952, and he became an ensign in the [[United States Navy Reserve]]. On completion of his combat tour with ''Essex'', he was assigned to a transport squadron, VR-32, in May 1952. He was released from active duty on August 23, 1952, but remained in the reserves, and was promoted to [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] on May 9, 1953.&lt;ref name="USN record" /&gt; As a reservist, he continued to fly, with VF-724 at [[Naval Air Station Glenview]] in Illinois, and then, after moving to California, with VF-773 at [[Naval Air Station Los Alamitos]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=118}} He remained in the reserve for eight years, before resigning his commission on October 21, 1960.&lt;ref name="USN record"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/bios/Armstrong-Neil/Armstrong_redacted_Redacted.pdf |title=Ex-Lieutenant (junior grade) Neil Alden Armstrong, U.S. Naval Reserve, Transcript of Naval Service |access-date=February 28, 2018 |publisher=United States Navy |date=March 27, 1967 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506025424/https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/bios/Armstrong-Neil/Armstrong_redacted_Redacted.pdf |archivedate=May 6, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== College years ==
After his service with the Navy, Armstrong returned to Purdue. His previously earned good but not outstanding [[Academic grading in the United States#Six-point system|grades]] now improved, lifting his final Grade Point Average (GPA) to a respectable but not outstanding 4.8 out of 6.0. He pledged the [[Phi Delta Theta]] [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity]], and lived in its fraternity house. He wrote and co-directed two musicals as part of the all-student revue. The first was a version of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarves'', co-directed with his girlfriend Joanne Alford from the [[Alpha Chi Omega]] sorority, with songs from the [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Walt Disney film]], including ''[[Someday My Prince Will Come]]''; the second was titled ''The Land of Egelloc'', with music from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] but new lyrics. He was chairman of the Purdue Aero Flying Club, and flew the club's aircraft, an [[Aeronca Aircraft|Aeronca]] and a couple of [[Piper Aircraft|Pipers]], which were kept at nearby Aretz Airport in [[Lafayette, Indiana]]. Flying the Aeronca to Wapakoneta in 1954, he damaged it in a rough landing in a farmer's field, and it had to be hauled back to Lafayette on a trailer.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=61–62}} He was a [[baritone horn|baritone]] player in the [[Purdue All-American Marching Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Purdue mourns alumnus Neil Armstrong|url=https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q3/purdue-mourns-alumnus-neil-armstrong.html|access-date=April 2, 2018|date=August 25, 2012|publisher=Purdue University|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216125803/http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2012/Q3/purdue-mourns-alumnus-neil-armstrong.html|archivedate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later he was made an honorary member of [[Kappa Kappa Psi]] national band honorary fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.purdue.edu/uns/html3month/1997/970425.Bands.campaign.html |access-date=July 10, 2018 |date=April 25, 1997 |title=Purdue Bands launch $2 million fund-raising campaign |publisher=Purdue University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Aeronautical Engineering]] in January 1955.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=118}} In 1970 he completed his [[Master of Science]] degree in [[Aerospace Engineering]] at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC).&lt;ref name=NASA-bio&gt;{{cite web |title=Biographical Data: Neil A.

Armstrong met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in [[family and consumer science|home economics]], at a party hosted by Alpha Chi Omega.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=62}} According to the couple, there was no real courtship, and neither could remember the exact circumstances of their engagement. They were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in [[Wilmette, Illinois]]. When he moved to [[Edwards Air Force Base]], he lived in the bachelor quarters of the base, while Janet lived in the [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]] district of [[Los Angeles]]. After one semester, they moved into a house in [[Antelope Valley]]. Janet did not finish her degree, a fact she regretted later in life. The couple had three children: Eric, Karen, and Mark.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=124–128}} In June 1961, Karen was diagnosed with a [[malignant]] [[tumor]] of the middle part of her [[Brainstem|brain stem]]; X-ray treatment slowed its growth, but her health deteriorated to the point where she could no longer walk or talk. She died of [[pneumonia]], related to her weakened health, on January 28, 1962, aged two.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=161–164}}

== Test pilot ==
Following his graduation from Purdue, Armstrong became an experimental research test pilot. He applied at the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) [[Armstrong Flight Research Center|High-Speed Flight Station]] at Edwards Air Force Base.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=119–120}} NACA had no open positions, and forwarded his application to the [[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], where Armstrong made his first test flight on March 1, 1955.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=119–120}} Armstrong's stint at Cleveland lasted only a couple of months before a position at the High-Speed Flight Station became available, and he reported for work there on July 11, 1955.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=130}}

On his first day, Armstrong was tasked with piloting [[chase plane]]s during releases of experimental aircraft from modified bombers. He also flew the modified bombers, and on one of these missions had his first flight incident at Edwards. On March 22, 1956, he was in a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]],{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=134}} which was to air-drop a [[Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket]]. He sat in the right-hand pilot seat while the left-hand seat commander, Stan Butchart, flew the B-29.&lt;ref name="Early NASA Years"&gt;{{cite web |last=Creech |first=Gray |title=From the Mojave to the Moon: Neil Armstrong's Early NASA Years |publisher=NASA |date=July 15, 2004 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/neil_armstrong.html |access-date=May 17, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630200654/http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/neil_armstrong.html |archivedate=June 30, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As they climbed to {{convert|30000|ft|km|0}}, the [[aircraft engine position number|number-four engine]] stopped and the [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] began windmilling (rotating freely) in the airstream. Hitting the switch that would stop the propeller's spinning, Butchart found it slowed but then started spinning again, this time even faster than the others; if it spun too fast, it would break apart. Their aircraft needed to hold an airspeed of {{convert|210|mph|0|abbr=on}} to launch its Skyrocket payload, and the B-29 could not land with the Skyrocket attached to its belly. Armstrong and Butchart brought the aircraft into a nose-down [[Attitude (geometry)|attitude]] to increase speed, then launched the Skyrocket. At the instant of launch, the number-four engine propeller disintegrated. Pieces of it damaged the number-three engine and hit the number-two engine. Butchart and Armstrong were forced to shut down the damaged number-three engine, along with the number-one engine, due to the [[torque]] it created. They made a slow, circling descent from {{convert|30000|ft|km|0|abbr=on}} using only the number-two engine, and landed safely.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=134–136}}

Armstrong served as project pilot on [[Century Series]] fighters, including the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]] A and C variants, the [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]], the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]], the [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief]] and the [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]]. He also flew the [[Douglas DC-3]], [[Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star]], [[North American F-86 Sabre]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]], [[Douglas F5D-1 Skylancer]], Boeing B-29 Superfortress, [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]], and was one of eight elite pilots involved in the [[NASA Paresev|Parasev]] paraglider research vehicle program.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=136–138}} Over his career, he flew more than 200 different models of aircraft.&lt;ref name=NASA-bio /&gt; His first flight in a [[rocket-powered aircraft]] was on August 15, 1957, in the [[Bell X-1]]B, to an altitude of {{convert|11.4|mi|km|1}}. On landing, the poorly designed [[Landing gear|nose landing gear]] failed, as had happened on about a dozen previous flights of the Bell X-1B. He flew the [[North American X-15]] seven times,{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=145}} including the first flight with the Q-ball system, the first flight of the number 3 X-15 airframe, and the first flight of the MH-96 adaptive flight control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mach25media.com/Resources/X15FlightLog.pdf |title=The X-15 Rocket Plane: , Flight Log |pp=22, 25 |publisher=Mach 25 Media |first=Michelle |last=Evans |date=2013 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413002147/http://www.mach25media.com/Resources/X15FlightLog.pdf |archivedate=April 13, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=147}} He became an employee of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) when it was established on October 1, 1958, absorbing NACA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Biographies/glennan.html |title=T.

Armstrong was involved in several incidents that went down in Edwards folklore or were chronicled in the memoirs of colleagues. During his sixth X-15 flight on April 20, 1962, when Armstrong was testing the MH-96 control system, he flew to a height of over {{convert|207,000|ft|km}} (the highest he flew before [[Gemini 8]]). He held up the aircraft nose for too long during its descent to demonstrate the MH-96's g-limiting performance, and the X-15 ballooned back up to around {{convert|140,000|feet|km}}. He flew past the landing field at [[Mach number|Mach]] 3 at over {{convert|100000|ft|km}} in altitude, and ended up {{convert|40|mi|km}} south of Edwards. After sufficient descent, he turned back toward the landing area, and landed, just missing [[Yucca brevifolia|Joshua trees]] at the south end. It was the longest X-15 flight in both flight time and length of the ground track.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=178–184}}

Many of the test pilots at Edwards praised Armstrong's engineering ability. [[Milton Orville Thompson|Milt Thompson]] said he was "the most technically capable of the early X-15 pilots". [[Bill Dana (pilot)|Bill Dana]] said Armstrong "had a mind that absorbed things like a sponge". Those who flew for the Air Force tended to have a different opinion, especially people like Yeager and [[William J. Knight|Pete Knight]], who did not have engineering degrees. Knight said that pilot-engineers flew in a way that was "more mechanical than it is flying", and gave this as the reason why some pilot-engineers got into trouble: their flying skills did not come naturally.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=138–139}} Armstrong made seven [[List of X-15 flights|flights in the X-15]] between November 30, 1960, and July 26, 1962.{{sfn|Jenkins|2000|pp=118–121}} He reached a top speed of Mach 5.74 ({{convert|3989|mph|0|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) in the X-15-1, and left the Flight Research Center with a total of 2,400 flying hours.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=210}}

On April 24, 1962, Armstrong flew for the only time with [[Chuck Yeager]]. Their job, flying a T-33, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake in [[Nevada]] for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a [[Touch-and-go landing|touch-and-go]], the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. As Armstrong told the story, Yeager never tried to talk him out of it and they made a first successful landing on the east side of the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck, provoking Yeager to fits of laughter.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=184–189}}

On May 21, 1962, Armstrong was involved in the "Nellis Affair". He was sent in an F-104 to inspect [[Delamar Dry Lake]] in southern Nevada, again for emergency landings. He misjudged his altitude, and did not realize that the landing gear had not fully extended. As he touched down, the landing gear began to retract; Armstrong applied full power to abort the landing, but the ventral fin and landing gear door struck the ground, damaging the radio and releasing [[hydraulic fluid]]. Without radio communication, Armstrong flew south to [[Nellis Air Force Base]], past the control tower, and waggled his wings, the signal for a no-radio approach. The loss of hydraulic fluid caused the [[tailhook]] to release, and upon landing, he caught the arresting wire attached to an anchor chain, and dragged the chain along the runway.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=189–192}}

It took thirty minutes to clear the runway and rig another arresting cable. Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only two-seater available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, where a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33, but he almost landed long. The Nellis base operations office then decided that to avoid any further problems, it would be best to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=189–192}}

In June 1958, Armstrong was selected for the U.S. Air Force's [[Man In Space Soonest]] program, but the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA) cancelled its funding on August 1, 1958, and on November 5, 1958, it was superseded by [[Project Mercury]], a civilian project run by NASA. As a NASA civilian test pilot, Armstrong was ineligible to become one of its astronauts at this time, as selection was restricted to military test pilots.{{sfn|Burgess|2013|pp=17–18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/first_up.html |title=First Up? |first=Tony |last=Reichhardt |magazine=Air &amp; Space Magazine |date=August–September 2000 |access-date=February 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1960, he was chosen as part of the pilot consultant group for the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]], a military space plane under development by Boeing for the U.S. Air Force, and on March 15, 1962, he was selected by the U.S. Air Force as one of seven pilot-engineers who would fly the X-20 when it got off the design board.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=171–173}}{{sfn|Burgess|2013|pp=19–21}}

In April 1962, NASA announced that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts for [[Project Gemini]], a proposed two-man spacecraft. This time, selection was open to qualified civilian test pilots.{{sfn|Burgess|2013|pp=4–6}} Armstrong visited the [[Seattle World's Fair]] in May 1962, and attended a conference there on space exploration that was co-sponsored by NASA. After he returned from [[Seattle]] on June 4, he applied to become an astronaut. His application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline, but Dick Day, a flight simulator expert with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=193–195}} At [[Brooks Air Force Base]] at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.{{sfn|Burgess|2013|pp=29–30}}

NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, [[Deke Slayton]], called Armstrong on September 13, 1962, and asked whether he would be interested in joining the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]] as part of what the press dubbed "the [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|New Nine]]"; without hesitation, Armstrong said yes. The selections were kept secret until three days later, although newspaper reports had been circulating since earlier that year that he would be selected as the "first civilian astronaut".{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=201–202}} Armstrong was one of two civilian pilots selected for this group;{{sfn|Burgess|2013|pp=64–66}} the other was [[Elliot See]], another former naval aviator.&lt;ref name=USastronaut&gt;{{cite web |title=Elliot M.

=== Gemini program ===
==== Gemini 5 ====
On February 8, 1965, Armstrong and [[Elliot See]] were announced as the backup crew for [[Gemini 5]], with Armstrong as its commander, supporting the prime crew of [[Gordon Cooper]] and [[Pete Conrad]].{{sfn|Reichl|2016|p=78}} The purpose of the mission was to practice [[space rendezvous]] and to develop procedures and equipment for a long-duration flight of seven days. These would be required for a mission to the Moon. With two other flights ([[Gemini 3]] and [[Gemini 4]]) in preparation, there were six crews competing for simulator time, resulting in Gemini 5 being postponed. The mission lifted off on August 21.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=255–256}} Armstrong and See watched the launch at [[Cape Kennedy]], and then flew to the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] in Houston.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=239}} The mission was generally successful, despite a problem with the [[fuel cell]]s that prevented a rendezvous. Cooper and Conrad practiced a "phantom rendezvous", carrying out the maneuver without a target.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=257–258}}

The crew assignments for Gemini 8 were announced on September 20, 1965. Under the normal rotation system, the backup crew for one mission would become the prime crew for the third mission after, but Slayton designated [[David Scott]] as the pilot of Gemini 8.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=240}}{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=523–529}} Scott was the first member of the [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|third group of astronauts]], whose selection was announced on October 18, 1963, to receive a prime crew assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/roundups/issues/63-10-30.pdf |title=14 New Astronauts Introduced at Press Conference |newspaper=Space News |volume=3 |issue=1 |date=October 30, 1963 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222121909/http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/roundups/issues/63-10-30.pdf |archivedate=December 22, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; See was designated to command [[Gemini 9]]. Henceforth, each Gemini mission would be commanded by a member of Armstrong's group, with a member of Scott's group as the pilot. Conrad would be Armstrong's backup this time, with [[Richard F. Gordon Jr.]] as his pilot.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=240}}{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=523–529}} Armstrong became the first American civilian in space; [[Valentina Tereshkova]] of the [[Soviet Union]] had become the first civilian (and first woman) nearly three years earlier aboard [[Vostok 6]] when it launched on June 16, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova (Born March 6, 1937) |url=http://www.yarregion.ru/eng/Pages/famous_people_Valentina_Vladimirovna_Tereshkova.aspx |publisher=Yaroslavl Regional Government |accessdate=July 27, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904004808/http://www.yarregion.ru/eng/Pages/famous_people_Valentina_Vladimirovna_Tereshkova.aspx |archivedate=September 4, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Armstrong would also be the last of his group to fly in space, as See died in a [[1966 NASA T-38 crash|T-38 crash]] on February 28, 1966, that also took the life of crewmate [[Charles Bassett]]. They were replaced by the backup crew of [[Thomas P. Stafford|Tom Stafford]] and [[Gene Cernan]], while [[Jim Lovell]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] moved up from the backup crew of [[Gemini 10]] to become the backup for Gemini 9,{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=323–325}} and would eventually fly [[Gemini 12]].{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|p=258}}

Gemini 8 launched on March 16, 1966. It was to be the most complex yet, with a rendezvous and docking with an unmanned [[Agena target vehicle]], and the second American [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) by Scott. In total, the mission was planned to last 75 hours and 55 orbits. After the Agena lifted off at 10:00:00 [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]],{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=242–244}} the [[Titan II GLV|Titan II]] rocket carrying Armstrong and Scott ignited at 11:41:02 EST, putting them into an orbit from which they chased the Agena.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|p=526}} They achieved the first-ever docking between two spacecraft in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=March 16, 1966: Gemini's First Docking of Two Spacecraft in Earth Orbit |publisher=NASA |url=https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/march-16-1966-geminis-first-docking-of-two-spacecraft-in-earth-orbit |access-date=April 30, 2018|date=March 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contact with the crew was intermittent due to the lack of tracking stations covering their entire orbits. Out of contact with the ground, the docked spacecraft began to roll, and Armstrong attempted to correct this with the [[Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System]] (OAMS) of the Gemini spacecraft. Following the earlier advice of Mission Control, they undocked, but found that the roll increased dramatically to the point where they were turning about once per second, indicating a problem with Gemini's [[attitude control]]. Armstrong engaged the Reentry Control System (RCS) and turned off the OAMS. Mission rules dictated that once this system was turned on, the spacecraft had to re-enter at the next possible opportunity. It was later thought that damaged wiring caused one of the thrusters to become stuck in the on position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Merritt |first=Larry |title=The abbreviated flight of Gemini 8 |publisher=Boeing |url=http://bts.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2006/march/i_history.html |date=March 2006 |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812222659/http://bts.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2006/march/i_history.html |archivedate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a few people in the Astronaut Office, including [[Walter Cunningham]], who felt that Armstrong and Scott "had botched their first mission".{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|pp=111–112}} There was speculation that Armstrong could have salvaged the mission if he had turned on only one of the two RCS rings, saving the other for mission objectives. These criticisms were unfounded; no malfunction procedures had been written, and it was only possible to turn on both RCS rings, not just one or the other.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=270–271}} [[Gene Kranz]] wrote, "the crew reacted as they were trained, and they reacted wrong because we trained them wrong." The mission planners and controllers had failed to realize that when two spacecraft are docked together, they must be considered to be one spacecraft. Kranz considered this the most important lesson.{{sfn|Kranz|2000|p=174}} Armstrong himself was depressed that the mission had been cut short,{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=274}} canceling most mission objectives and robbing Scott of his EVA. The Agena was later re-used as a docking target by Gemini 10.{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=321–322}} Armstrong and Scott received the [[NASA Exceptional Service Medal]],&lt;ref name="NASA Awards"&gt;{{cite |url=https://searchpub.nssc.nasa.gov/servlet/sm.web.Fetch/Agency_Awards_Historical_Recipient_List.pdf?rhid=1000&amp;did=2120817&amp;type=released |title=Agency Awards Historical Recipient List |publisher=NASA |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202083252/https://searchpub.nssc.nasa.gov/servlet/sm.web.Fetch/Agency_Awards_Historical_Recipient_List.pdf?rhid=1000&amp;did=2120817&amp;type=released |archivedate=December 2, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Air Force awarded Scott the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=143831 |title=Valor awards for David Randolph Scott |publisher=Military Times Hall of Valor|access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301225001/https://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=143831 |archivedate=March 1, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], and Armstrong received a $678 raise in pay to $21,653 a year ({{Inflation|US|21,653|1966|fmt=eq}}), making him NASA's highest paid astronaut.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=274}}

==== Gemini 11 ====
{{Main|Gemini 11}}
The final assignment for Armstrong in the Gemini program was as the back-up Command Pilot for [[Gemini 11]], announced two days after the landing of Gemini 8. Having trained for two flights, Armstrong was quite knowledgeable about the systems and took on a teaching role for the rookie backup Pilot, [[William Anders]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=292–293}} The launch was on September 12, 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gemini-XI |publisher=NASA (Kennedy Space Center) |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/gemini/gemini-xi/gemini-xi.html |access-date=July 24, 2010 |date=August 25, 2000 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64v3PKGaL?url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/gemini/gemini-xi/gemini-xi.html |archivedate=January 24, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Conrad and Gordon on board, who successfully completed the mission objectives, while Armstrong served as a [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM).{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=294–296}}

Following the flight, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] asked Armstrong and his wife to take part in a 24-day goodwill tour of South America.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=296–297}} Also on the tour, which took in 11 countries and 14 major cities, were Dick Gordon, [[George Low]], their wives, and other government officials. In Paraguay, Armstrong greeted dignitaries in their local language, [[Guarani language|Guarani]]; in Brazil he talked about the exploits of the Brazilian-born [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=298–299}}

=== Apollo program ===
On January 27, 1967, the date of the [[Apollo 1 fire]], Armstrong was in Washington, DC, with Cooper, Gordon, Lovell and [[Scott Carpenter]] for the signing of the United Nations [[Outer Space Treaty]]. The astronauts chatted with the assembled dignitaries until 18:45, when Carpenter went to the airport, and the others returned to the Georgetown Inn, where they each found messages to phone the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]]. During these telephone calls, they learned of the deaths of [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] and [[Roger B. Chaffee|Roger Chaffee]] in the fire. Armstrong and the group spent the rest of the night drinking scotch and discussing what had happened.{{sfn|Lovell|Kluger|2000|pp=24–25}}

On April 5, 1967, the same day the Apollo 1 investigation released its final report on the fire, Armstrong assembled with 17 other astronauts for a meeting with Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, "The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room."{{sfn|Cernan|Davis|1999|p=165}} According to Cernan, one of the astronauts present, Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for [[Apollo 9]], which at that stage was planned to be a [[medium Earth orbit]] test of the [[Lunar Module]]–[[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] combination.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=312–313}}

This crew assignment was officially announced on November 20, 1967.{{sfn|Brooks et al.|2009|p=374}} For crewmates, he was assigned Lovell and Aldrin, the crew of Gemini 12. After design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module (LM), [[Apollo 8]] and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong would command Apollo 11.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=312–313}} There would be one change. [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Mike Collins]] on the Apollo 8 crew began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=288–289}} Lovell took his place on the Apollo 8 crew, and, when he recovered, Collins joined Armstrong's crew.{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|p=109}}

To give the astronauts experience with how the LM would fly on its final landing descent, NASA commissioned [[Bell Aircraft]] to build two [[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]]s (LLRV), later augmented with three Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV). Nicknamed the "Flying Bedsteads", they simulated the Moon's one-sixth of Earth's gravity by using a [[turbofan]] engine to support five-sixths of the craft's weight. On May 6, 1968, {{convert|100|feet|m|0}} above the ground, Armstrong's controls started to degrade and the LLRV began [[aircraft principal axes|rolling]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=330}} He ejected safely. Later analysis suggested that if he had ejected half a second later, his parachute would not have opened in time. His only injury was from biting his tongue. The LLRV was completely destroyed.{{sfn|Kraft|2001|p=312}} Even though he was nearly killed, Armstrong maintained that without the LLRV and LLTV, the lunar landings would not have been successful, as they gave commanders valuable experience in the behavior of lunar landing craft.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=334}}

In addition to the LLRV training, NASA began lunar landing simulator training after Apollo 10 was completed. Aldrin and Armstrong worked with the instructors to train for the most feasible possibilities they could encounter during a real lunar landing.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=171}} The pair only made time to go on one geological expedition, to the mountains of west Texas. The press found out, and filled the area with cars and a helicopter, which made it hard for the astronauts to hear the geologist. They also received briefings from geologists while at NASA.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=179}}

Left to right are Armstrong, [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and [[Buzz Aldrin]].]]
After Armstrong served as backup commander for Apollo 8, Slayton offered him the post of commander of Apollo 11 on December 23, 1968, as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon.{{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=17}} In a meeting that was not made public until the publication of Armstrong's biography in 2005, Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Armstrong as Commander, Lunar Module (LM) Pilot Buzz Aldrin and Command Module (CM) Pilot Michael Collins, he was offering Armstrong the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell. After thinking it over for a day, Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin, as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command. Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the Lunar Module Pilot, unofficially the lowest ranked member, and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell, the commander of Gemini 12, in the number 3 position of the crew.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=338}} The crew of Apollo 11 was officially announced on January 9, 1969, as Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin, with Lovell, Anders and [[Fred Haise]] as the backup crew.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=312–313}}

According to [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr.|Chris Kraft]], a March 1969 meeting between Slayton, George Low, [[Robert R. Gilruth|Bob Gilruth]] and Kraft determined that Armstrong would be the first person on the Moon, in part because NASA management saw him as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the Lunar Module Pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his book.{{sfn|Kraft|2001|pp=323–324}}{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=365–373}} Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if these were considered at the time. Slayton added, "Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out&amp;nbsp;... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision."{{sfn|Cortright|1975|p=160}}

===== Voyage to the Moon =====
A [[Saturn V]] rocket launched Apollo 11 from [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39]] site at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (09:32:00 EDT local time).{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=92}} Armstrong's wife Janet and two sons watched from a yacht moored on the [[Banana River]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=2}} During the launch, Armstrong's heart rate peaked at 110 beats per minute.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=410}} He found the first stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch. The Apollo CM was relatively roomy compared to the Gemini spacecraft. None of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from [[Space adaptation syndrome|space sickness]], as some members of previous crews had. Armstrong was especially happy, as he had been prone to [[motion sickness]] as a child and could experience [[nausea]] after doing long periods of [[aerobatics]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=411–412}}

[[File:Neil Armstrong.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Armstrong smiling in his spacesuit with the helmet off. He wears a headset and his eyes look slightly watery.|Armstrong in the lunar module after the completion of the [[extravehicular activity|EVA]]]]
The objective of Apollo 11 was to land safely rather than to touch down with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the LM ''Eagle'' would probably touch down several miles beyond the planned landing zone.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=11}} As the ''Eagle''{{'}}s landing [[radar]] acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code [[Jack Garman#1202|1202]] alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM [[Charles Duke]] in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive overflow in the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|Lunar Module computer]]. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary ''[[In the Shadow of the Moon (film)|In the Shadow of the Moon]]'', the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data and did not have enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did so with the objective of facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=459–465}}

When Armstrong noticed they were heading toward a landing area which he believed was unsafe, he took over manual control of the LM, and attempted to find an area which seemed safer, taking longer than expected, and longer than most simulations had taken.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=199}} For this reason, there was concern from Mission Control that the LM was running low on fuel.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=198}} Upon landing, Aldrin and Armstrong believed they had 40 seconds left on their fuel, including the 20 seconds' worth which had to be saved in the event of an abort.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=200}} During training, Armstrong had landed the LLTV with less than 15 seconds left on several occasions, and he was also confident the LM could survive a vertical fall from {{convert|50|ft|m}} if needed. Analysis after the mission showed that at touchdown there was 45 to 50 seconds of propellant burn time left.{{sfn|Manned Spacecraft Center|1969|pp=9-23–9-24}}

The landing on the surface of the Moon occurred several seconds after 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Eric M. |title=The First Lunar Landing, time 109:45:40 |url=http://www.history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html |website=Apollo 11 Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |access-date=March 4, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225232200/https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html |archivedate=December 25, 2017  }} That was the time of probe contact; the exact time of landing is difficult to determine, because Armstrong said the landing was "very gentle" and "It was hard to tell when we were on."&lt;/ref&gt; at which time one of three {{convert|67|in|cm|adj=on}} probes attached to three of the Lunar Module's four legs made contact with the surface, a panel light inside the LM lit up, and Aldrin called out, "Contact light." Armstrong shut the engine off and said, "Shutdown." As the LM settled onto the surface, Aldrin said, "Okay. Engine stop", then they both called out some post-landing checklist items. After a ten-second pause, Duke acknowledged the landing with, "We copy you down, ''Eagle''." Armstrong announced the landing to Mission Control and the world with the words, "Houston, [[Tranquility Base]] here. The ''Eagle'' has landed."

The official NASA flight plan called for a crew rest period before extravehicular activity, but Armstrong requested that the EVA be moved to earlier in the evening, [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Houston time]]. Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, ''Eagle'' was depressurized, the hatch was opened and Armstrong made his way down the ladder.{{sfn|Cortright|1975|p=215}} At the bottom of the ladder Armstrong said, "I'm going to step off the LM now". He turned and set his left boot on the lunar surface at 02:56 [[UTC]] July 21, 1969,{{sfn|Harland|1999|p=23}} then spoke the now-famous words, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mikkelson |first=Barbara |first2=David |last2=Mikkelson |title=One Small Misstep: Neil Armstrong's First Words on the Moon |date=October 2006 |website=Snopes.com |url=http://www.snopes.com/quotes/onesmall.asp |accessdate=September 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong prepared his famous [[epigram]] on his own.&lt;ref name="Plimpton" /&gt; In a post-flight press conference, he said that he chose the words "just prior to leaving the LM."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 11 Post Flight Press Conference, 16 September 1969|url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/FirstLunarLanding/ch-7.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=July 24, 2015|quote=Yes, I did think about it.

Recordings of Armstrong's transmission do not provide evidence for the indefinite article "a" before "man", though NASA and Armstrong insisted for years that static had obscured it. Armstrong stated he would never make such a mistake, but after repeated listenings to recordings, he eventually conceded he must have dropped the "a".&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt; He later said he "would hope that history would grant me leeway for dropping the syllable and understand that it was certainly intended, even if it was not said—although it might actually have been".{{sfn|Nickell|2008|p=175}} There have since been claims and counter-claims about whether acoustic analysis of the recording reveals the presence of the missing "a";&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goddard |first=Jacqui |title=One small word is one giant sigh of relief for Armstrong |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=October 2, 2006 |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/americas/article2000645.ece |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Shann Ford]], an Australian computer programmer, conducted a digital audio analysis and claims that Armstrong did say "a man", but the "a" was inaudible due to the limitations of communications technology of the time.&lt;ref name="Snopes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Peter Shann |title=Electronic Evidence and Physiological Reasoning Identifying the Elusive Vowel "a" in Neil Armstrong's Statement on First Stepping onto the Lunar Surface |website=CollectSpace.com |date=September 17, 2006 |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-100306a.html |accessdate=August 28, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015424/http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-100306a.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Software Finds Missing 'a' in Armstrong's Moon Quote |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=October 1, 2006 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/09/30/moon.quote.ap/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004151135/http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/09/30/moon.quote.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 4, 2006|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford and [[James R.

About 20 minutes after the first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface and became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of investigating how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, Armstrong unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also with Aldrin, planted the [[Lunar Flag Assembly|flag of the United States]]. Although Armstrong had wanted the flag to be draped on the flagpole,{{sfn|Chaikin|2007|p=212}} it was decided to use a metal rod to hold it horizontal on the pole.{{sfn|Johnson|2008|p=60}} Since the rod did not fully extend, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|pp=503–504}} Shortly after their flag planting, President [[Richard Nixon]] spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=505–506}} In the Apollo 11 photographic record there are only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected. The mission was planned to the minute, with the majority of photographic tasks performed by Armstrong with the single [[Hasselblad]] camera.&lt;ref name="AS11-40-5886"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.5886.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728042723/http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.5886.html |archive-date=July 28, 2011  |date=July 28, 2011 |title=AS11-40-5886 |last1=Jones |first1=Eric M. |website=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |access-date=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After helping to set up the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package|Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package]], Armstrong went for a walk to what is now known as East Crater, {{convert|65|yd|m}} east of the LM, the greatest distance traveled from the LM on the mission.

After they re-entered the LM, the hatch was closed and sealed. While preparing for the liftoff from the lunar surface, Armstrong and Aldrin discovered that, in their bulky spacesuits, they had broken the ignition switch for the ascent engine; using part of a pen, they pushed the circuit breaker in to activate the launch sequence.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=489–490}} The ''Eagle'' then continued to its rendezvous in lunar orbit, where it docked with ''Columbia'', the [[Command and Service Module]]. The three astronauts returned to Earth and splashed down in the [[Pacific Ocean]], to be picked up by the {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1969-059A |title=Apollo 11 Command and Service Module (CSM) |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918002017/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1969-059A |archivedate=September 18, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being released from an 18-day quarantine to ensure that they had not picked up any infections or diseases from the Moon, the crew were feted across the United States and around the world as part of a 45-day "Giant Leap" tour. Armstrong then took part in [[Bob Hope]]'s 1969 [[United Service Organizations|USO]] show, primarily to Vietnam.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=580}} In May 1970, Armstrong traveled to the Soviet Union to present a talk at the 13th annual conference of the International Committee on Space Research; after arriving in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] from Poland, he traveled to Moscow where he met [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] [[Alexei Kosygin]]. Armstrong was the first westerner to see the supersonic [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and was given a tour of the [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center]], which he described as "a bit Victorian in nature".{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=583}} At the end of the day, he was surprised to view a delayed video of the launch of [[Soyuz 9]] as it had not occurred to Armstrong that the mission was taking place, even though [[Valentina Tereshkova]] had been his host and her husband, [[Andriyan Nikolayev]], was on board.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=582–584}}

=== Teaching ===

Armstrong announced shortly after the Apollo 11 flight that he did not plan to fly in space again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Riley |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/09/apollo-astronauts-walking-moon |title=The Moon Walkers: Twelve Men Who Have Visited Another World |date=July 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204055219/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/09/apollo-astronauts-walking-moon |archivedate=February 4, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator for aeronautics for the Office of Advanced Research and Technology at ARPA; he served in this position for only a year, and resigned from it and NASA in 1971.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=584}} He accepted a teaching position in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the [[University of Cincinnati]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Neil Armstrong Remembered|url = http://ceas.uc.edu/about/neil-armstrong-remembered.html|website = University of Cincinnati|accessdate = November 28, 2015|language = en-US|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208165113/http://ceas.uc.edu/about/neil-armstrong-remembered.html|archivedate = December 8, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; having chosen Cincinnati over other universities, including his ''alma mater'', Purdue, because Cincinnati had a small aerospace department.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|p=590}} He hoped that the faculty members would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only the USC master's degree.&lt;ref name="a11 crew"&gt;{{cite web |title=Apollo 11 Crew Information |website=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |last1=Jones |first1=Eric M. |publisher=NASA |date=November 1, 2005 |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.crew.html |accessdate=August 28, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828070600/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.crew.html |archivedate=August 28, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his master's degree while stationed at Edwards years before, and completed it after Apollo 11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=590–594}}

At Cincinnati he was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. He took a heavy teaching load and taught core classes. Armstrong created two graduate-level classes while at the university: aircraft design and experimental flight mechanics.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|p=592}} He was considered a good teacher, and was a tough grader. His research activities during this time did not involve him working for NASA. He did not want to give the appearance of favoritism, and he later regretted that decision. After teaching for eight years, he resigned in 1980. When the university changed from an independent municipal university to a state school, bureaucracy increased. He did not want to be a part of the faculty collective bargaining group, so he decided to teach half-time. According to Armstrong, he had the same amount of work but received half of his salary. In 1979, less than 10% of his income came from his university salary. Employees at the university did not know why he left.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=590–594}}

=== NASA commissions ===
In 1970, after the explosion and aborted lunar landing of [[Apollo 13]], Armstrong was part of [[Edgar Cortright]]'s accident investigation. He produced a detailed chronology of the flight. A 28-volt thermostat switch in an oxygen tank was supposed to be replaced with a 65-volt version, which led to the explosion. Cortright recommended a redesign of the entire tank, at a cost of $40 million. Many NASA managers, as well as Armstrong, opposed the report's recommendation to re-design the oxygen tanks, since the thermostat switch was the source of the explosion. They lost the argument, and the tanks were redesigned.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=600–603}}

In 1986, President [[Ronald Reagan]] requested that Armstrong join the [[Rogers Commission Report|Rogers Commission]], which investigated the ''Challenger'' disaster. Armstrong was appointed vice chairman of the commission. He was in charge of the operational side of the commission, and performed private interviews with contacts he developed over the years to help determine the cause of the accident. As vice chair, he helped keep the number of recommendations the committee gave to nine. He believed if there were too many recommendations, NASA would not act on them.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=610–616}}

[[File:Apollo 11 - Crew at the White House.jpg|thumb|Michael Collins, President [[George W. Bush]], Neil Armstrong, and Buzz Aldrin during celebrations of the 35th anniversary of the Apollo 11 flight, July 21, 2004]]
Armstrong was appointed to a fourteen-member commission by President Reagan, to develop a plan for American civilian spaceflight in the 21st century. The commission was chaired by Dr. [[Thomas O. Paine]], former NASA administrator, who Armstrong had worked with during the Apollo program. The group published a book titled ''Pioneering the Space Frontier: The Report on the National Commission on Space''. The commission recommended establishing a permanent lunar base by 2006 and sending humans to Mars by 2015. The recommendations were largely ignored, as the fallout from the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] took priority.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|pp=609–610}}

Armstrong and his wife attended the memorial service for the victims of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] in 2003, at the invitation of President [[George W. Bush]].{{sfn|Hansen|2012|pp=616–617}}

=== Business activities ===
After Armstrong retired from NASA in 1971, he acted as a spokesman for several businesses. The first company to successfully approach him was [[Chrysler]], for whom he appeared in advertising starting in January 1979. Armstrong thought they had a strong engineering division, and they were in financial difficulty. He later acted as a spokesman for other American companies, including General Time Corporation and the Bankers Association of America.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=595}} He only acted as a spokesman for American companies.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=596}}

Along with spokesman duties, he also served on the board of directors of several companies. The first company which Armstrong joined the board was [[Gates Learjet]], chairing their technical committee. He flew their new and experimental jets and even set a climb and altitude record for business jets. Armstrong became a member of [[Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company]]'s board in 1973. They were interested in nuclear power and wanted to increase the company's technical competence. He served on the board of [[Taft Broadcasting]], also based in Cincinnati. Armstrong joined [[Thiokol]]'s board in 1989, after he was vice-chair of the Rogers Commission; the [[Space Shuttle]] ''Challenger'' was destroyed due to a problem with the Thiokol-manufactured solid rocket boosters. When Armstrong left the University of Cincinnati, he became the chairman of Cardwell International Ltd., a company that manufactured drilling rigs. He served on additional aerospace boards, first [[United Airlines]] in 1978 and later [[Eaton Corporation]] in 1980. He was asked to chair the board of directors for a subsidiary of Eaton, AIL Systems. He chaired the board through the company's 2000 merger with [[EDO Corporation]], until his retirement in 2002.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=596–598}}

=== North Pole expedition ===
In 1985, professional expedition leader Mike Dunn organized a trip to take men he deemed the "greatest explorers" to the [[North Pole]]. The group included Armstrong, [[Edmund Hillary]], [[Peter Hillary|Hillary's son Peter]], [[Steve Fossett]], and [[Patrick Morrow]], and arrived on April 6, 1985. Armstrong said he was curious to see what the North Pole looked like from ground level, as he had only seen it from the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/neil-armstrong-and-sir-edmund-hillarys-trip-to-the-north-pole|title=When Neil Armstrong and Edmund Hillary Took a Trip to the North Pole|date=August 27, 2013|publisher=Atlas Obscura|access-date=May 19, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512111015/http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/neil-armstrong-and-sir-edmund-hillarys-trip-to-the-north-pole|archivedate=May 12, 2016|last1=Bruhns|first1=Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong wanted to keep the expedition private, and kept the media in the dark about the trip.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|p=609}}

=== Television and film ===
In 2010, he voiced the character of Dr. Jack Morrow in ''[[Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/09/quantum-quest/ |title=NASA Footage Sets Scene for Quantum Quest Movie |journal=Wired |first=Hugh |last=Hart |date=March 9, 2010 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301224818/https://www.wired.com/2010/09/quantum-quest/ |archivedate=March 1, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt; an animated educational sci-fi adventure film initiated by JPL/NASA through a grant from Jet Propulsion Lab.&lt;ref name=J9P&gt;{{cite web  |title=Quantum Quest  |publisher=jupiter9productions.com  |url=http://jupiter9productions.com/news.aspx  |accessdate=October 8, 2012  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108191010/http://jupiter9productions.com/News.aspx  |archivedate=January 8, 2013    }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1991 and 1993, he hosted ''[[First Flights with Neil Armstrong]]'', an [[aviation history]] [[documentary series]] on [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]].{{sfn|Shapiro|2012|pp=9, 267, 268}}

=== Reclusiveness ===

Armstrong kept a low profile later in his life, which led to the belief that he was a recluse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/08/26/opinion/seymour-armstrong-appreciation/index.html|title=Neil Armstrong, a hero who shunned fame|last1=Seymour|first1=Gene|publisher=CNN|date=August 27, 2012|access-date=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo1&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/19/AR2009071901771.html?noredirect=on|title=Neil Armstrong Took One Small Step, Then Made a Giant Retreat Into Private Life|last1=Farhi|first1=Paul|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 20, 2009|access-date=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned down most interviews and declined many public appearances. Michael Collins said in his book ''Carrying the Fire'' that when Armstrong moved to a dairy farm to become a college professor it was like he "retreated to his castle and pulled up the drawbridge". Armstrong found this amusing, and noted that, "...those of us that live out in the hinterlands think that people that live inside the Beltway are the ones that have the problems." Andrew Chaikin says in ''A Man on the Moon'' that Armstrong kept a low profile, but was not a recluse, due to participation in interviews, advertisements for Chrysler, and hosting a cable television series.{{sfn|Chaikin|2007|pp=568–570}}

Armstrong used to autograph everything except for [[first day cover]]s. Around 1993, he found out his signatures were being sold online, and most of them were forgeries, so he stopped autographing material.&lt;ref name=wapo1 /&gt; Armstrong also wrote letters congratulating Eagle Scouts on their accomplishment. He used to answer all requests for congratulations. In part of 2003, he had received 950 requests for letters to Eagle Scouts. He decided to quit the practice in the 1990s because he felt the letters should be written by people who knew the scout. These things combined contributed to the reclusiveness myth.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|pp=622–623}}

Armstrong's family described him as a "reluctant American hero".&lt;ref name="The National"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |title=Neil Armstrong, first man on the Moon, dead at 82 |date=August 26, 2012 |url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/neil-armstrong-first-man-on-the-moon-dead-at-82-1.607011 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304172524/https://www.thenational.ae/uae/neil-armstrong-first-man-on-the-moon-dead-at-82-1.607011 |archivedate=March 4, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/neil-armstrong-praised-as-a-reluctant-american-hero |date=August 30, 2012 |title=Neil Armstrong Praised as a Reluctant American Hero |first=Bob |last=Granath |publisher=NASA |access-date=July 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neil Armstrong a 'reluctant American hero': family |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=August 25, 2012 |first=Olivia |last=Hampton |access-date=July 8, 2018 | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/neil-armstrong-a-reluctant-american-hero-family/article4499479/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Glenn]], the first American to orbit Earth, recalled Armstrong's humility. "He didn't feel that he should be out huckstering himself," Glenn told CNN. "He was a humble person, and that's the way he remained after his lunar flight, as well as before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |title=Tributes paid to Neil Armstrong, the humblest of American heroes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/9500380/Tributes-paid-to-Neil-Armstrong-the-humblest-of-American-heroes.html |date=August 26, 2013 |access-date=July 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some former astronauts (such as Glenn and [[Harrison Schmitt]]) sought political careers after leaving NASA, but although Armstrong was approached by political groups from both parties, he declined all offers. He described his political leanings as favoring [[states' rights]] and opposing the United States acting as the "world's policeman".{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=600–601}}

When Armstrong applied at a local Methodist church to lead a Boy Scout troop in the late 1950s he gave his religious affiliation as "[[deist]]".{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=33}} His mother later said that Armstrong's religious views caused her grief and distress in later life as she was more religious.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=35}}  In the early 1980s, Armstrong was the subject of a hoax saying that he converted to Islam after hearing the ''[[adhan]]'', the Muslim call to prayer, while walking on the Moon. The Indonesian singer Suhaemi wrote a song called "Gema Suara Adzan di Bulan" ("The Resonant Sound of the Call to Prayer on the Moon") which described Armstrong's conversion; the song was discussed widely in various [[Jakarta]] news outlets in 1983.{{sfn|Abramson|2004|p=93}} Other similar hoax stories were seen in Egypt and Malaysia. In March 1983, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] responded by issuing a message to embassies and consulates in Muslim countries saying that Armstrong "has not converted to Islam".{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=630–631}} The hoax surfaced occasionally for the next three decades. Part of the confusion arose from the similarity between the names of Armstrong's American residence in [[Lebanon, Ohio]], and the country of [[Lebanon]], which has a majority Muslim population.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=630–631}}

In 1972, Armstrong visited the town of [[Langholm]], Scotland, the traditional seat of [[Clan Armstrong]]; he was made the first freeman of the [[burgh]], and happily declared the town his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=Willie |title=Recalling Moon man's 'muckle' leap |publisher=BBC News |date=July 20, 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8158762.stm |access-date=July 20, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720100435/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8158762.stm |archivedate=July 20, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Justice of the Peace]] read from an unrepealed 400-year-old law that required him to hang any Armstrong found in the town.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=13}}

While working at his farm near Lebanon, Ohio, in November 1978, Armstrong jumped off the back of his grain truck and his wedding ring got caught in the wheel, tearing off the tip of his left hand's ring finger. He collected the severed digit and packed it in ice, and surgeons reattached it at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=608}} In February 1991, a year after his father had died, and nine months after the death of his mother, he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at [[Aspen, Colorado]].{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=639–640}}

Armstrong and his first wife, Janet, separated in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/first-man-fact-vs-fiction-neil-armstrong-movie-daughter-bracelet.html|title=What’s Fact and What’s Fiction in First Man, the New Neil Armstrong Movie|last=Stein|first=Ellin|magazine=Slate Magazine|date=October 15, 2018|access-date=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and divorced in 1994, after 38 years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schorn |first=Daniel |title=Being The First Man On The Moon  |publisher=CBS News |date=July 2, 2006 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/03/60minutes/main1008288_page3.shtml |accessdate=January 9, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013013459/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/03/60minutes/main1008288_page3.shtml |archivedate=October 13, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He met his second wife, Carol Held Knight, in 1992 at a golf tournament, where they were seated together at the breakfast table. She said little to Armstrong, but two weeks later she received a call from him asking what she was doing—she replied she was cutting down a cherry tree; 35 minutes later Armstrong was at her house to help out. They were married on June 12, 1994, in Ohio, and then had a second ceremony, at San Ysidro Ranch, in California. He lived in [[Indian Hill, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=John |last2=Amrhein |first2=Saundra |last3=Thompson |first3=Richelle |title=Neil Armstrong, Reluctant Hero |date=July 18, 1999 |newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1999/07/18/loc_neil_armstrong_the.html |access-date=March 4, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=643–645}}

After 1993, Armstrong refused all requests for autographs because his signed items were selling for large amounts of money and many forgeries were in circulation; any requests that were sent to him received a [[form letter]] in reply, saying that he had stopped signing.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=622–623}} Although his no-autograph policy was well known, author [[Andrew Smith (author)|Andrew Smith]] observed people at the 2002 [[Reno Air Races]] trying to get signatures, with one person claiming, "If you shove something close enough in front of his face, he'll sign."{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=134}} He also stopped sending out congratulatory letters to new Eagle Scouts, because he believed these letters should come from people who knew the Scouts personally.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=623}}

Armstrong guarded the use of his name, image, and famous quote.

A tribute was held for Armstrong on September 13 at [[Washington National Cathedral]], whose Space Window depicts the Apollo 11 mission and holds a sliver of Moon rock amid its stained-glass panels.&lt;ref name="aljazeu" /&gt; In attendance were Armstrong's Apollo 11 crewmates, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin; Gene Cernan, the Apollo 17 mission commander and last man to walk on the Moon; and former Senator and astronaut John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth. In a eulogy, Charles Bolden praised Armstrong's "courage, grace, and humility". Cernan recalled Armstrong's low-fuel approach to the Moon: "When the gauge says empty we all know there's a gallon or two left in the tank!" [[Diana Krall]] sang the song "[[Fly Me to the Moon]]". Collins led prayers. Scott recalled their Gemini 8 mission with Armstrong when he spoke, possibly for the first time, about an incident in which glue spilled on his harness and prevented it from locking correctly minutes before the hatch had to be sealed or the mission aborted. Armstrong then called on Conrad to solve the problem, which he did, to continue the mission without stopping the countdown clock.

In 2010, he made a rare public criticism of the decision to cancel the [[Ares I]] launch vehicle and the [[Constellation program|Constellation Moon landing program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=I suspect that even though the various questions are difficult and many, they are not as difficult and many as those we faced when we started the Apollo [space program] in 1961.|last=Kaplan |first=Jeremy A. |title=Star Wars: Neil Armstrong, Obama Spar Over NASA's Future |date=April 14, 2010 |publisher=Fox News |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/04/14/obama-vs-neil-armstrong-nasa-constellation/?test=latestnews |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029081228/http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/04/14/obama-vs-neil-armstrong-nasa-constellation/?test=latestnews |archivedate=October 29, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter also signed by fellow Apollo veterans Lovell and Cernan, he noted, "For The United States, the leading space faring nation for nearly half a century, to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, destines our nation to become one of second or even third rate stature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Armstrong |first=Neil |last2=Lovell |first2=James |last3=Cernan |first3=Eugene |title=Armstrong: Obama NASA plan 'devastating' |date=April 14, 2010 |publisher=NBC Nightly News |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/36470363/ns/nbc_nightly_news_with_brian_williams/t/armstrong-obama-nasa-plan-devastating/ |access-date=October 18, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103111342/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36470363 |archivedate=November 3, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong had also publicly recalled his initial concerns about the Apollo 11 mission, when he had believed there was only a 50 percent chance of landing on the Moon. "I was elated, ecstatic and extremely surprised that we were successful", he later said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Yoong |title=Neil Armstrong: Manned Mars mission 20 years away |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |location=Washington DC |date=September 6, 2005 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2005-09-06-mars-armstrong_x.htm |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726194523/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2005-09-06-mars-armstrong_x.htm |archivedate=July 26, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, 2010, aged 80, Armstrong said in a speech during the ''[[Meet the Future, Science &amp; Technology Summit 2010|Science &amp; Technology Summit]]'' in The Hague, Netherlands, that he would offer his services as commander on a mission to Mars if he were asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Neil Armstrong wil nog best naar Mars |trans-title=Neil Armstrong still wants to go to Mars |newspaper=NU.nl |via=ANP |language=nl |date=November 18, 2010 |url=http://www.nu.nl/wetenschap/2382331/neil-armstrong-wil-nog-best-mars.html |access-date=February 28, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220151853/https://www.nu.nl/wetenschap/2382331/neil-armstrong-wil-nog-best-mars.html |archivedate=February 20, 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>The referenced German article gives the number "37,000 m" and unlike in English, the comma denotes the decimal separator, so it's an equivalent of dot in English notation. This means the difference is 37 meters (see the German version of the article). The trailing zeros must stand for the precision of the measurement (compare to the German version that says the difference is exactly 37 m).</comment>

'''''Normalnull''''' ("standard zero") or '''Normal-Null''' (short '''N.&amp;nbsp;N.''' or '''NN''' ) is an outdated official [[Geodetic system#Vertical data|vertical datum]] used in Germany. Elevations using this reference system were to be marked "Meter über Normal-Null" (“meters above standard zero”). Normalnull has been replaced by [[Normalhöhennull]] (short NHN).

== History ==
In 1878 reference heights were taken from the [[Amsterdam Ordnance Datum]] and transferred to the [[Berlin Observatory#New Berlin Observatory|New Berlin Observatory]] in order to define the [[Normalhöhenpunkt 1879]]. Normalnull has been defined as a level going through an imaginary point 37.000&amp;nbsp;m below ''Normalhöhenpunkt 1879''. When the New Berlin Observatory was demolished in 1912 the reference point was moved east to the village of Hoppegarten (now part of the town of [[Müncheberg]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;S.

From the application point of view, the main objective of soil mapping is to accurately predict response of a soil-plant ecosystem to various soil management strategies. In other words, the main objective of pedometric mapping is to generate maps of [[soil map|soil properties and soil classes]] that can be used to feed other environmental models or for decision making. Pedometric mapping is largely based on applying [[geostatistics]] in soil science and other statistical methods used in [[pedometrics]].

Although pedometric mapping is mainly data-driven, it can also largely be based on use of expert knowledge. The expert knowledge, however, needs to be ''plugged-in'' into a pedometric computational framework so that it can be used to produce more accurate prediction models. For example, [[data assimilation]] techniques, such as the space–time [[Kalman filter]], can be used to integrate pedogenetic knowledge and field observations.&lt;ref name="Heuvelink2001Geoderma"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heuvelink|first=G.B.M|author2=Webster, R|title=Modelling soil variation: past, present, and future|journal=Geoderma|date=30 April 2001|volume=100|issue=3-4|pages=269–301|doi=10.1016/S0016-7061(01)00025-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[information theory]] context, the objective of pedometric mapping is to describe the spatial complexity of soils (information content of soil variables over a geographical area), then represent this complexity using maps, summary measures, mathematical models and simulations.&lt;ref name=Hengl2012JAG&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hengl|first=T.|author2=Nikolić, M. |author3=MacMillan, R.A. |title=Mapping efficiency and information content|journal=International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation|date=31 March 2012|doi=10.1016/j.jag.2012.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulations are a preferred way of visualizing soil patterns as they represent both the deterministic pattern due to the landscape, geographic hot-spots and short range variability (see image below).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Pedometric vs traditional soil mapping ==

In traditional soil survey, spatial distribution of soil properties and soil bodies can be inferred using mental models which leads to manual delineations. Such methods can be considered to be subjective, and it is hence difficult or impossible to statistically assess the accuracy of such maps without additional field sampling. Traditional soil survey mapping has some limitations for use in a multithematic GIS related to the fact that is often not consistently applied by different mappers, it is largely manual and it is difficult to automate. Most of traditional soil maps in the world are based on manual delineations of assumed soil bodies, to which then soil attributes are attached.&lt;ref name="McBratney2003Geoderma"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McBratney|first=A.B |author2=Mendonça Santos, M.L |author3=Minasny, B|title=On digital soil mapping|journal=Geoderma|date=1 November 2003|volume=117|issue=1-2|pages=3–52|doi=10.1016/S0016-7061(03)00223-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorsten2006JPNSS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Behrens|first=Thorsten|author2=Scholten, Thomas|title=Digital soil mapping in Germany—a review|journal=Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science|date=1 June 2006|volume=169|issue=3|pages=434–443|doi=10.1002/jpln.200521962}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of pedometric mapping, all outputs are based on using rigorous statistical computing and are hence [[reproducible research|reproducible]].

Pedometric mapping is largely based on using extensive and detailed covariate layers such as Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derivatives, remote sensing imagery, climatic, land cover and geological GIS layers and imagery. Evolution of pedometric mapping can be closely connected with the emergence of new technologies and global, publicly available data sources such as the [[SRTM]] DEM, [[MODIS]], [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]] and [[Landsat]] imagery, gamma radiometrics and LiDAR imagery, and new [[automated mapping]] methods.

== Pedometric mapping methods ==

Pedometric mapping methods differ based on the soil survey data processing steps:
* Sampling
* Data screening 
* Preprocessing of soil covariates
* Fitting of geostatistical model
* Spatial prediction
* Cross-validation / accuracy assessment
* Visualization of outputs

One of the main theoretical basis for pedometric mapping is the universal model of soil variation:&lt;ref name="Heuvelink2001Geoderma" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burrough1986PGIS&gt;{{cite book|last=Burrough|first=P.A.|title=Principles of Geographical Information Systems for Land Resources Assessment|year=1986|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z(\mathbf{s}) = m(\mathbf{s}) + \varepsilon '(\mathbf{s}) + \varepsilon ''&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{m(\mathbf{s})}&lt;/math&gt; is the deterministic part of soil variation, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\varepsilon '(\mathbf{s})}&lt;/math&gt; is the stochastic, spatially auto-correlated part of variation, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\varepsilon ''}&lt;/math&gt; is the remaining residual variation (measurement errors, short-range variability etc.) that is also possibly dependent on &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\mathbf{s}}&lt;/math&gt;, but it is not modeled. This model has been first time introduced by French mathematician [[Georges Matheron]], and has shown to be the [[BLUP|Best Unbiased Linear Predictor]] for spatial data. One way of using this model to produce predictions or simulations is by means of [[regression-kriging]] (also known as universal [[kriging]]). In the case of soil data, the deterministic component of the model is often modeled using the soil forming factors: climate, organism, relief, parent material, or lithology, and time. This conceptual model is known as the [[Clorpt|CLORPT]] model, and has been the first time introduced to soil-landscape modelling by [[Hans Jenny (pedologist)|Hans Jenny]].&lt;ref name="Grunwald2006CRC" /&gt;

A special group of techniques of pedometric mapping focus on downscaling the spatial information that can be area-based or continuous. Prediction of [[soil taxonomy|soil classes]] is also another sub-field of pedometric mapping where specific geostatistical methods are used for the purpose of interpolation of factor-type of variables.

Pedometric mapping is also largely based on using novel technologies for measuring soil properties, also referred to as the [[digital soil mapping]] techniques. These include:
* [[Soil spectroscopy]] and proximal soil sensing (hand-held or vehicle-driven devices)
* [[Remote sensing]] systems for mapping and monitoring soils (e.g. [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite|SMOS]])
* [[LiDAR]] technology to produce [[digital elevation model]]s
* [[Precision agriculture]] technologies

'''Pedra da Galinha Choca''' (Rock of the Brooding Hen) is a [[rock formation]] in the [[Brazil]]ian city of [[Quixadá]] in [[Ceará]], taking its name from its curious shape. It is located 5&amp;nbsp;km from the city center.&lt;ref name="Galinha Choca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webventure.com.br/destinoaventura/destinos/index/atracoes/destino/quixada/atr/707|title=Galinha Choca|accessdate=2010-11-16|language=portuguese|publisher=Webventure}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The formation is in the [[Quixadá Monoliths Natural Monument]], a fully protected area.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;

Until the early twentieth century was called the ''Pedra da Arara'' (Arara's Stone{{Verify source|date=April 2011}}&lt;!-- may be "Macaw Stone" --&gt;).
It consists of [[inselberg]] diorites and [[granites]], which are igneous rocks, i.e., formed from cooling [[magma]]. Like other monoliths of the region, the Pedra da Galinha Choca is on a crystalline ground, i.e., consists of ancient and tough rocks that were formed during the [[Precambrian]], and which with erosion eventually stood above the surface.

The Barragem do Cedro (Cedar Dam) was built between 1890 and 1906 using stone masonry, cement and steel, at the foot of the Pedra da Galinha Choca. On 30 January 2015 the dam was placed on the tentative list as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{citation |title=Cedro Dam in the Quixadá Monoliths|publisher=UNESCO |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5998/|accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
During the early 1900s, the study of regional-scale [[geomorphology]] was termed "physiography". Unfortunately, physiography later was considered to be a contraction of "'''''physi'''''cal" and "ge'''''ography'''''", and therefore synonymous with [[physical geography]], and the concept became embroiled in controversy surrounding the appropriate concerns of that discipline. Some geomorphologists held to a geological basis for physiography and emphasized a concept of physiographic regions while a conflicting trend among geographers was to equate physiography with "pure morphology," separated from its geological heritage. In the period following World War II, the emergence of process, climatic, and quantitative studies led to a preference by many Earth scientists for the term "geomorphology" in order to suggest an analytical approach to landscapes rather than a descriptive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Victor R. |title=Geomorphology From Space: A Global Overview of Regional Landforms, Introduction |publisher=[[NASA]] |year=1986 |url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_1/GEO_CHAPTER_1.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315105147/http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_1/GEO_CHAPTER_1.shtml |archivedate=2008-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In current usage, physiography still lends itself to confusion as to which meaning is meant, the more specialized "geomorphological" definition or the more encompassing "physical geography" definition. For the remainder of this article, emphasis will remain on the more "geomorphological" usage, which is based upon geological landforms, not on climate, vegetation, or other non-geological criteria.

For the purposes of physiographic mapping, landforms are classified according to both their geologic structures and histories. Distinctions based on geologic age also correspond to physiographic distinctions where the forms are so recent as to be in their first [[Cycle of erosion|erosion cycle]], as is generally the case with sheets of [[Glacial Drift|glacial drift]]. Generally, forms which result from similar histories are characterized by certain similar features, and differences in history result in corresponding differences of form, usually resulting in distinctive features which are obvious to the casual observer, but this is not always the case. A maturely [[dissected plateau]] may grade without a break from rugged mountains on the one hand to mildly rolling farm lands on the other. So also, forms which are not classified together may be superficially similar; for example, a young [[coastal plain]] and a [[peneplain]]. In a large number of cases, the boundary lines are also geologic lines, due to differences in the nature or structure of the underlying rocks.&lt;ref name="Fenneman-US" /&gt;

===History===

====19th-century====
The history of "physiography" itself is at best a complicated effort. Much of the complications arise from how the term has evolved over time, both as its own 'science' and as a synonym for other branches of science. In 1848, [[Mary Somerville]] published her book ''Physical Geography'' which gave detailed descriptions of the [[topography]] of each continent, along with the distribution of plant, animals and humans. This work gave impetus to further works along the field. In Germany, Oscar Peschel in 1870, proposed that geographers should study the morphology of the Earth's surface, having an interest in the study of landforms for the development of human beings. As the chair of geography (and a geologist by training) in Bonn, Germany, [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] made the study of landforms the main research field for himself and his students. Elsewhere, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s ''Physiography'' was published in 1877 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name="Huxley1877"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=Physiography: An Introduction to the Study of Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FiT_td97DT8C|date=1 June 1877|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4179-0806-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the field of "physical geography" itself was renamed as "physiography". Afterwards, physiography became a very popular school subject in Britain, accounting for roughly 10% of all examination papers in both English and Welsh schools, and physiography was now regarded as an integral, if not the most important aspect of geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt-Jensen |first=Arild |title=Geography, History and Concepts: A Student's Guide |publisher=Sage Publications Inc. |year=1999 |pages=40–42 |isbn=0-7619-6180-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with these 'advances' in physiography, physically and visually mapping these descriptive areas was underway as well. The early photographers and balloonists, [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]] and Triboulet, experimented with aerial photography and the view it provided of the landscape. In 1899, [[Albert Heim]] published his photographs and observations made during a balloon flight over the Alps; he is probably the first person to use aerial photography in geomorphological or physiographical research. The block diagrams of Fenneman, Raisz, Lobeck and many others were based in part upon both aerial photography and topographic maps, giving an oblique "birds-eye" view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hayden |first=Robert S. |title=Geomorphology From Space: A Global Overview of Regional Landforms, Chapter 11: Mapping |publisher=NASA |year=1986 |url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_11/index.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====20th century====
By 1901, there were clear differences in the definition of the term physiography. "In England, physiography is regarded as the introduction to [[physical science]] in general. It is made to include the elements of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]], physical geography, and [[geology]], and sometimes even certain phases of [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. In America, the term has a somewhat different meaning. It is sometimes used as a [[synonym]] for physical geography, and is sometimes defined as the science which describes and explains the physical features of the earth's surface".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Student's Reference Work: A Cyclopaedia for Teachers, Students, and Families |publisher=C.B. Beach and Company |year=1901 |location=New York and Chicago |pages=1123 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IVkPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1123&amp;dq=subject:%22Encyclopedias+and+dictionaries.%22+%2Bphysiography |author1= Adam, Graeme Mercer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1911, the definition of physiography in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' had evolved to be "In popular usage the words 'physical geography' have come to mean geography viewed from a particular standpoint rather than any special department of the subject. The popular meaning is better conveyed by the word physiography, a term which appears to have been introduced by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], and was reinvented as a substitute for the cosmography of the Middle Ages by Professor Huxley. Although the term has since been limited by some writers to one particular part of the subject, it seems best to maintain the original and literal meaning. In the stricter sense, physical geography is that part of geography which involves the processes of contemporary change in the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and the circulation of the fluid envelopes. It thus draws upon physics for the explanation of the phenomena with the space-relations of which it is specially concerned. Physical geography naturally falls into three divisions, dealing respectively with the surface of the [[lithosphere]] – geomorphology; the [[hydrosphere]] – [[oceanography]]; and the [[atmosphere]] – [[climatology]]. All these rest upon the facts of mathematical geography, and the three are so closely inter-related that they cannot be rigidly separated in any discussion".&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Geography |volume=11 |page=630 |inline=1 |first=Hugh Robert |last=Mill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1919 edition of ''The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge'' further adjusted the definition to be "Physiography (geomorphology), now generally recognized as a science distinct from geology, deals with the origins and development of land forms, traces out the topographic expression of structure, and embodies a logical history of oceanic basins, and continental elevations; of [[mountain]]s, [[plateau]]s and [[plain]]s; of hills and valleys. Physical geography is used loosely as a synonym, but the term is more properly applied to the borderland between geography and physiography; dealing, as it does, largely with the human element as influenced by its physiographic surroundings".

====21st-century====
Even in the 21st century, some confusion remains as to exactly what "physiography" is. One source states "Geomorphology includes quaternary geology, physiography and most of physical geography",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Geomorphology |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/geomorphology/ |accessdate=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; treating physiography as a separate field, but subservient to geomorphology. Another source states "Geomorphology (or physiography) refers to the study of the surface features of the earth. It involves looking at the distribution of land, water, soil and rock material that forms the land surface. Land is closely linked to the geomorphology of a particular landscape",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Geomorphology |publisher=[[Government of Alberta]] |year=2006 |url=http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/land/quality/html/quality/geomorphology.html |accessdate=2007-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225004304/http://www3.gov.ab.ca/env/land/quality/html/quality/geomorphology.html |archivedate=2007-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding physiography as synonymous with geomorphology. Yet another source states "Physiography may be viewed from two distinct angles, the one dynamic, the other passive". The same source continues by stating "In a large fashion [[geodynamics]] is intimately associated with certain branches of geology, as [[sediment]]ation, while geomorphology connects physiography with geography. The dynamic interlude representing the active phase of physiography weaves the basic threads of geologic history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glock |first=Waldo S. |title=Dual Nature of Physiography | journal = Science | volume = 72 | issue = 1853 |pages=3–5 |publisher=|year=1930 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/72/1853/3 | doi = 10.1126/science.72.1853.3 |accessdate=2007-12-21 |pmid=17769440 |bibcode=1930Sci....72....3G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Geological Survey defines physiography as a study of "Features and attributes of earth's land surface",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Alphabetical index, Physiography |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |url=http://www.usgs.gov/science/science-kwic.php?letter=p |accessdate=2007-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212213206/http://www.usgs.gov/science/science-kwic.php?letter=p |archivedate=2007-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while geomorphology is defined separately as "Branch of geology dealing with surface land features and the processes that create and change them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=|first=|title=Subject index, Geomorphology |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |url=http://www.usgs.gov/science/science.php?term=468 |accessdate=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to this confusion over what "physiography" actually means, some scientists have refrained from using the term physiography (and instead use the similar term geomorphology) because the definitions vary from the American Geological Institute's "the study and classification of the surface features of Earth on the basis of similarities in geologic structure and the history of geologic changes" to descriptions that also include vegetation and/or land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Belward |first=Alan S. |author2=Valenzuela, Carlos R. |title=Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems for Resource Management in Developing Countries |publisher=Springer |year=1991 |pages=430 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8XvOEfo6fX8C&amp;pg=PA430&amp;lpg=PA430&amp;dq=%22geomorphic+mapping%22+physiography |isbn=0-7923-1268-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6590">{{about|the disparity in services etc. between different geographic areas|other uses}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], the term '''postcode lottery''' has two definitions:
*A situation where [[Postcodes in the United Kingdom|postcodes]] directly affect the services an area can obtain, such as [[insurance]] prices. Despite having many non-postal uses, postcodes are only determined based on [[Royal Mail]] operations and bear little relation to local government boundaries.
*More broadly, the unequal provision of services around the country, especially in [[public services]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2000/nov/09/NHS | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Q&amp;A: Postcode lottery | first=Patrick | last=Butler | date=2000-11-09 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as access to cancer drugs in the healthcare system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/2700686/Healthcare-postcode-lottery-means-patients-losing-out-on-cancer-treatments.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Healthcare postcode lottery means patients losing out on cancer treatments | first=Kate | last=Devlin | date=2008-09-08 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or quality of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/postcode-lottery-still-determines-degree-achievement-1805468.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Postcode lottery still determines degree achievement | first=Richard | last=Garner | date=2009-10-19 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are more likely to be a result of local budgets and decision-making than actual postcodes.

== Details ==

Postcodes were devised solely for the purposes of sorting and directing mail and rarely coincide with political boundaries. However, over time they have become a geographical reference in their own right with postcodes and postcode groups becoming synonymous with certain towns and districts. Further to this, the postcode has been used by organisations for other applications including government statistics, marketing, calculation of car and household insurance premiums and credit referencing.

There are several groups, mostly on the fringes of major population centres, who are affected in one way or another by the associations of their postcode. There is a movement in the [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead]] to change the first two characters of their postcodes from {{postcode|SL}} to WM for vanity, so as not to be associated with [[Slough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2668561.stm |title=England &amp;#124; 'Snobs' want to slough off postcode |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-01-17 |accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A businessman in [[Ilford]] wishes to have the postcode district of {{postcode|IG|1}} changed to {{postcode|E|19}} as he claims customers do not realise his business is based in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scrivens |first=Louise |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4409163.stm |title=England &amp;#124; London &amp;#124; The power of the postcode |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-04-05 |accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of West Heath in {{postcode|SE|2}} wish to have their postcodes changed to that of adjacent [[Bexleyheath]], citing higher insurance premiums as reason to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/archive/display.var.334327.0.cracking_the_codes_not_easy.php |title=Cracking The Codes Not Easy (from This Is Local London) |publisher=Thisislocallondon.co.uk |date=2002-03-12 |accessdate=2010-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526111315/http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/archive/display.var.334327.0.cracking_the_codes_not_easy.php |archivedate=2008-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some residents of [[Kingston Vale]] in {{postcode|SW|15}} wish to have their postcodes changed to adjacent [[Kingston upon Thames]] for the same reasons{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}.

In all these cases [[Royal Mail]] has said that there is "virtually no hope" of changing the postcode, referring to their policy of changing postcodes only to match changes in their operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scrivens |first=Louise |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4409163.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; London &amp;#124; The power of the postcode |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-04-05 |accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this policy residents of the [[Wirral Peninsula]] had their postcodes changed from the {{postcode|L}} (Liverpool) to {{postcode|CH}} (Chester) group when a new sorting office was opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.thisiswirral.co.uk/1999/09/09/13953.html |title=Postman Pat Gets L Of A Row Off His Chest&amp;nbsp;— This Is Wirral |publisher=Archive.thisiswirral.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927084419/http://archive.thisiswirral.co.uk/1999/09/09/13953.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some postcode areas straddle [[England]]'s borders with [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]]. Examples of such postcodes include {{postcode|CH|4}}, {{postcode|SY|10}}, {{postcode|NP|16}} and {{postcode|TD|15}}. This has led to [[British Sky Broadcasting]] subscribers receiving the wrong BBC and ITV regions, and newly licensed [[amateur radio|radio amateurs]] being given incorrect [[call sign]]s.

Postcomm says the following regarding the extended use of postcodes and the [[Postcode Address File]] (PAF):

{{Cquote|Many organisations&amp;nbsp;– including new postal operators, banks, insurance companies and others offering to deliver goods to your door&amp;nbsp;— have a need for this information. It would be very time-consuming and costly for anyone to try and replicate the list, so Royal Mail licenses PAF data, for a fee, allowing others to use it. ... Although we have a role in ensuring that PAF is managed well, Postcomm does not intervene to resolve disputes involving individual postcodes. A postcode is a routing instruction, allowing a postal operator to sort and deliver mail accurately and efficiently. It is not necessarily a geographically accurate description of where a property is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psc.gov.uk/postcomm/live/factsheets/Royal_Mail_Postcode_Address_File.pdf | title=Royal Mail’s Postcode Address File | author=[[Postal Services Commission]] | publisher=Postcomm |date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Seascape ecology''' is a scientific discipline that deals with the causes and [[Ecology|ecological]] consequences of spatial pattern in the [[marine environment]], drawing heavily on conceptual and analytical frameworks developed in terrestrial [[landscape ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Wiens JA, Wu J, Urban DL (2017) Chapter 16: Landscape ecologist’s perspectives on seascape ecology. p485-494. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Overview==

Seascape ecology, the application of landscape ecology concepts to the marine environment&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ (2017) Chapter 1: Introducing Seascape Ecology. p3-25. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; has been slowly emerging since the 1970s &lt;ref&gt;Sousa WP (1979) Disturbance in marine intertidal boulder fields: the nonequilibrium maintenance of species diversity. Ecology 60(6): 1225–1239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paine RT, Levin SA (1981) Intertidal landscapes: disturbance and the dynamics of pattern. Ecological Monographs 51(2): 145–178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walsh WJ (1985) Reef fish community dynamics on small artificial reefs: the influence of isolation, habitat structure, and biogeography. Bulletin of Marine Science 36(2):357–376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steele JH (1989) The ocean ‘landscape’. Landscape Ecology 3(3–4): 185–192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones GP, Andrew NL (1992) Temperate reefs and the scope of seascape ecology. In Battershill CN, Schiel DR, Jones GP, Creese RG, MacDiarmid AB (eds) 2nd International Temperate Reef Symposium (7–10 January 1992). NIWA Marine, Auckland, pp. 63–76.&lt;/ref&gt;, yielding new ecological insights and showing growing potential to support the development of ecologically meaningful science-based management practices &lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Kneib RT, Simenstad C. (2011) Practicing coastal seascape ecology. Marine Ecology Progress Series 427, 187-190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olds AD, Connolly RM, Pitt KA, Pittman SJ, Maxwell PS, Huijbers CM, Moore BR, Albert S, Rissik D, Babcock RC, Schlacher TA. (2016) Quantifying the conservation value of seascape connectivity: a global synthesis. Global Ecology and Biogeography 25(1):3-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Lepczyk CA, Wedding LM, Parrain C (2017) Chapter 12: Advancing a holistic systems approach in applied seascape ecology. p367-389. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young MA, Wedding LM, Carr MH (2017) Applying landscape ecology for the design and evaluation of marine protected area networks. p429-464.In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. For marine systems, the application of landscape ecology came about through a recognition that many of the concepts developed in the theory of [[island biogeography]]&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur RH,Wilson EO (1967) The Theory of Island Biogeography. Monographs in Population Biology. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simberloff DS (1974) Equilibrium theory of island biogeography and ecology. Annual review of Ecology and Systematics, 5(1), pp.161-182.&lt;/ref&gt; and the study of patch dynamics (precursors to modern landscape ecology) could be applicable to a range of marine environments from plankton patches &lt;ref&gt;Steele JH (1978) Spatial Pattern in Plankton Communities. Plenum Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; to patch reefs &lt;ref&gt;Molles MC Jr (1978) Fish species diversity on model and natural reef patches: experimental insular biogeography. Ecological Monographs 48: 289–305.&lt;/ref&gt;, intertidal mussel beds &lt;ref&gt;Paine RT, Levin SA (1981) Intertidal landscapes: disturbance and the dynamics of pattern.
Ecological Monographs 51(2): 145–178.&lt;/ref&gt; and seagrasses meadows &lt;ref&gt;McNeill SE, Fairweather PG (1993) Single large or several small marine reserves? An experimental approach with seagrass fauna. Journal of Biogeography 1: 429–440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins BD, Bell SS (1994) Seagrass landscapes: a terrestrial approach to the marine subtidal environment. Trends in Ecology and Evolution 9(8): 301–314.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Progress in the ecological understanding of spatial patterning was not confined to shallow seafloor environments. For the [[open ocean]], advances in ocean observing systems since the 1970s have allowed scientists to map, classify, quantify and track dynamic spatial structure in the form of [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]], [[surface roughness]], currents, runoff plumes, ice, temperature fronts and plankton patches using oceanographic technologies – a theme increasingly referred to as pelagic seascape ecology &lt;ref&gt;Hidalgo M, Secor DH, Browman HI (2016) Observing and managing seascapes: linking synoptic oceanography, ecological processes, and geospatial modelling. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 73(7), pp.1825-1830.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kavanaugh MT, Hales B, Saraceno M, Spitz YH, White AE, Letelier RM (2014) Hierarchical and dynamic seascapes: A quantitative framework for scaling pelagic biogeochemistry and ecology. Progress in Oceanography, 120, pp.291-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scales KL, Alvarez-Berastegui D, Embling C, Ingram S (2017) Chapter 3: Pelagic seascapes. p57-88. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;.Subsurface structures too, such as [[Internal wave|internal waves]], [[Thermocline|thermoclines]], [[Halocline|haloclines]], boundary layers and stratification resulting in distinct layering of organisms, is increasingly being mapped and modelled in multiple dimensions.

Like landscape ecologists, seascape ecologists are interested in the spatially explicit geometry of patterns and the relationships between pattern, ecological processes and environmental change. A central tenet in landscape ecology is that patch context matters, where local conditions are influenced by attributes of the surroundings. For instance, the physical arrangement of objects in space, and their location relative to other things, influences how they function&lt;ref&gt;Bell SS, McCoy ED, Mushinsky HR (EDS.). 1991. Habitat structure: the physical arrangement of objects in space. Chapman and Hall, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt;. 

A landscape ecologist will ask different questions focused at different scales than other scientists, such as: What are the ecological consequences of different shaped patches, patch size, quality, edge geometry, spatial arrangement and diversity of patches across the landscape? At what scale(s) is structure most influential? How do landscape patterns influence the way that animals find food, evade predators and interact with competitors? How does human activity alter the structure and function of landscapes?

Several guiding principles that exist at the core of landscape ecology have made major contributions to terrestrial landscape planning and conservation, but in marine systems our understanding is still in its infancy. The first book on seascape ecology was published in December 2017&lt;ref&gt;Seascape Ecology edited by Simon J. Pittman http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119084431.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Seascapes are defined broadly as spatially heterogeneous and dynamic spaces that can be delineated at a wide range of scales in time and space. With regard to seascapes defined by sampling units, a 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; quadrat can be a valid seascape sample unit (SSU), just as can a 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; analytical window in a geographical information system. The wide diversity of possible focal scales in marine ecology means that the term seascape cannot be used as an indication of scale, or a level of organisation.

== Seascape patterns ==
The sea exhibits complex spatial patterning that can be mapped and quantified, such as gradients in plant communities across [[Salt marsh|tidal saltmarshes]] or the intricate mosaics of patches typical of [[Coral reef|coral reefs]]&lt;ref&gt;Costa B, Walker BK, Dijkstra JA (2017) Chapter 2: Mapping and quantifying seascape patterns. p27-56. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. In the open ocean too, dynamic spatial structure in the form of water currents, eddies, temperature fronts and plankton patches can be measured readily&lt;ref&gt;Bakun A (1996) Patterns in the Ocean: Ocean Processes and Marine Population Dynamics.
University of California Sea Grant, San Diego, CA, United States in cooperation with
Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas de Noroeste, La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scales KL, Alvarez-Berastegui D, Embling C, Ingram S (2017) Chapter 3: Pelagic seascapes.
 p57-88. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;. Physical processes such as storms dramatically influence spatial patterning in the environment and human activity can also directly create patch structure, modify mosaic composition and even completely remove elements of the seascape. Furthermore, climate-change induced shifts in species related to water temperature change and sea level rise are driving a gradual reconfiguration of the geography of species and habitats.

The patterns revealed by remote sensing devices are most often mapped and represented using two types of model: (1) collections of discrete patches forming mosaics e.g.  as represented in two-dimensional benthic habitat map, or (2) continuously varying gradients in three-dimensional terrain models e.g. in remotely sensed bathymetric data&lt;ref&gt;McGarigal K, Tagil S, Cushman SA (2009) Surface metrics: an alternative to patch metrics for the quantification of landscape structure. Landscape Ecology 24(3): 433–450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wedding L, Lepczyk C, Pittman S, Friedlander A, Jorgensen S (2011) Quantifying seascape structure: extending terrestrial spatial pattern metrics to the marine realm. Marine Ecology Progress Series 427: 219–232.&lt;/ref&gt;. In landscape ecology, patches can be classified into a binary patch-matrix model based on island biogeography theory where a focal habitat patch type (e.g. seagrasses) is surrounded by an inhospitable matrix (e.g. sand), or a patch-mosaic of interconnected patches, where the interactions of the parts influence the ecological function of the whole mosaic. Both patch and gradient models have provided important insights into the spatial ecology of marine species and biodiversity.

== Scale matters ==
Scale, the spatial or temporal dimensions of a phenomenon, is central to seascape ecology and the topic permeates all applications of a seascape ecology approach from conceptual models through to design of sampling, analyses and interpretation of results&lt;ref&gt;Schneider DC (2001) The rise of the concept of scale in ecology: The concept of scale is evolving from verbal expression to quantitative expression. BioScience 51(7): 545–553.&lt;/ref&gt;. Species and life-stage responses to patchiness and gradients in environmental structure are likely to be scale dependent, therefore, scale selection is an important task in any ecological study. Seascape ecology acknowledges that decisions made for scaling ecological studies influence our perspective and ultimately our understanding of ecological patterns and processes&lt;ref&gt;Levin SA (1992) The problem of pattern and scale in ecology. Ecology 73: 1943–1967.&lt;/ref&gt;. Historically, marine scientists have played a significant role in communicating the importance of scale in ecology&lt;ref&gt;Schneider DC (2017) Chapter 4: Scale and scaling in seascape ecology. p89-117. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, a physical oceanographer, [[Henry Stommel]], published a conceptual diagram that was to have a profound effect on all of the environmental sciences &lt;ref&gt;Vance TC, Doel RE (2010) Graphical methods and cold war scientific practice: The Stommel diagram’s intriguing journey from the physical to the biological environmental sciences. Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences 40: 1–47.&lt;/ref&gt;. The diagram &lt;ref&gt;Stommel H (1963) Varieties of oceanographic experience. Science 139: 572–576.&lt;/ref&gt; depicted variation in sea level height at spatial scales from centimetres to that of the planet and at time scales from seconds to tens of millennia&lt;ref&gt;Schneider DC (2017) Chapter 4: Scale and scaling in seascape ecology. p89-117. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;. The oceanographer [[John Steele (oceanographer)|John Steele]] (1978) adapted the Stommel diagram to depict the spatial and temporal scales of patchiness in [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]] and [[fish]].
[[File:Seascape scales.jpg|thumb|Seascape scales]]
Measuring habitat structure at multiple scales is typical in seascape ecology, particularly where a single meaningful scale is not known or not meaningful to the ecological process of interest. Multi-scale measurements have been used to discover the scale at which populations are associated with key habitat features&lt;ref&gt;Schneider DC, Piatt JF (1986) Scale-dependent correlation of seabirds with schooling fish in a coastal ecosystem. Marine Ecological Progress Series 32: 237–246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Brown KA (2011) Multi-scale approach for predicting fish species distributions across coral reef seascapes. PLoS ONE 6(5): e20583.&lt;/ref&gt;. With regard to scaling seascapes, one approach is to select spatial and temporal scales to be ecologically meaningful to the organism’s movements or other processes of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Hile SD, Caldow, C &amp; Monaco ME (2007) Using seascape types to explain the spatial patterns of fish using mangroves in Puerto Rico. Marine Ecology Progress Series 348, 273-284&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of information, or the lack of continuous observation on the way animals use space through time, can all too often result in insufficient consideration of seascape context potentially resulting in misleading conclusions on the primary drivers of ecological patterns and processes. Pittman and McAlpine (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ &amp; McAlpine CA (2003) Movements of marine fish and decapod crustaceans: Process, theory and application. Advances in Marine Biology 44, 205-294.&lt;/ref&gt; offer a multi-scale framework for scaling ecological studies that integrates hierarchy theory with movement ecology and the concept of ecological neighborhoods&lt;ref&gt;Addicott JF, Aho JM, Antolin MF, Padilla DK, Richardson JS, Soluk DA (1987) Ecological neighborhoods: scaling environmental patterns. Oikos 1:340-346.&lt;/ref&gt;. Here the focal scale is guided by the spatial and temporal scales relevant to an ecological process of interest. The focal scale is nested within a spatial hierarchy that incorporates patterns and processes at both finer and broader scales&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ, Davis B, Santos-Corujo RO (2017) Chapter 7: Animal movements through the seascape: Integrating movement ecology with seascape ecology. p189-227. In Pittman SJ (ed.) Seascape Ecology. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5916">Most [[List of states of Mexico|Mexican states]] do not have an official [[flag]].  For these states, a ''de facto'' flag is used for civil and state purposes, typically consisting of a white background charged with the state's [[Coats of arms of states of Mexico|coat of arms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/mx-.html ''CRW Flags'']; Mexico; retrieved May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

At least five states have official flags: [[Durango]], [[Jalisco]], [[Querétaro]], [[Quintana Roo]] and [[Tlaxcala]]. Except for Jalisco and Tlaxcala, each official flag is simply a white background charged with the state's coat of arms.  Tlaxcala's flag was designed by [[Desiderio Hernández Xochitiotzin]] in 1981 and was painted in his mural ''El siglo de oro tlaxcalteca'' in the [[Tlaxcala Municipality]] ''cabildo'' before being made the official flag in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-tlaxcala.mx/nota/2017-04-21/congreso/resena-historica-de-la-bandera-de-tlaxcala |title=Reseña histórica de la bandera de Tlaxcala |date= 2017-04-21 |website=e-consulta.com Tlaxcala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two states have provisions in their constitutions explicitly declaring that there shall be no official state flag.  These states are [[Baja California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitución Política|url=http://www.bajacalifornia.gob.mx/portal/nuestro_estado/historia/doctos/constitucion_BC.pdf|website=bajacalifonia.gob.mx|publisher=Gobierno del Estado|accessdate=May 20, 2016}}  Per Chapter 3, Article 6, "there shall be no other flags ... of official character" (''No habrá otros banderas ... de carácter oficial'').&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Campeche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitución Política|url=http://www.transparencia.campeche.gob.mx/images/stories/Documentos/n/leyes/Constitucion_Politica_del_Estado_de_Campeche.pdf|website=campeche.gob.max|publisher=Gobierno del Estado|accessdate=May 20, 2016}}  Per Chapter 2, Article 5, "there shall be no other flags ... of official character" (''No habrá otros banderas ... de carácter oficial'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Article 3 states that the state's coat of arms can be represented in the form of a flag (''puede representarse en forma de Bandera'') and gives rules on how the coat of arms shall appear when used in that form.  The article specifies that the flag shall consist of the coat of arms on a white background, and gives further physical specifications.  Chapter 4 (Articles 7 through 18) gives rules regarding the use of the coat of arms when it is in the form of a flag (''en su modalidad de Bandera'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sub-prefectures''' (known in French as ''sous-prefectures'') are the third-level administrative divisions in [[Guinea]]. As of 2009 there were 303 rural communes of Guinea and 38 urban communes, 5 of which compose the [[Conakry]] greater urban area; [[Kaloum]], [[Dixinn]], [[Matam, Guinea|Matam]], [[Ratoma]] and [[Matoto]].

In [[Kiribati]], there are no more official subdivisions but it is possible to divide Kiribati geographically into three groups of islands:
*[[Gilbert Islands]]
*[[Line Islands]]
*[[Phoenix Islands]].

Kiribati was divided into 6 districts until independence:
* [[Banaba Island|Banaba]]
* [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]]
* [[Northern Gilbert Islands]]
* [[Central Gilbert Island]]
* [[South Gilbert Islands|Southern Gilbert Islands]]
* [[Line Islands]]

Four of the former districts (including Tarawa) lie in the Gilbert Islands, where most of the islands' population lives.  Only three of the Line Islands are inhabited, while the Phoenix Islands are uninhabited apart from Kanton (31 people) and have no representation.  Banaba itself is sparsely inhabited now (295 people in 2010). There is also a representative non-elected of the Banabans relocated to [[Rabi Island]] in the nation of [[Fiji]].

== Island Councils==
There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council. Two atolls have
more than one island councils:  Tarawa has three and Tabiteuea has 2, for a total of 24 local councils.

An '''urban refugee''' is a [[refugee]] who decided or was obliged to settle in an [[urban area]] rather than in a [[refugee camp]] in the country or territory where the person fled to. More than 60% of the world's refugee population and 80% of [[internally displaced person]]s (IDP) under [[UNHCR]] mandate live in urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/urban-refugees.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, their number was around 5.5 million people. "Urban refugee" is not a recognized legal term in the [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]]. However, the UNHCR has adopted a 'Policy on Refugee Protection and Solutions in Urban Areas' in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/docid/4ab8e7f72.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban refugees are among the most vulnerable groups in low income countries. According to UNHCR, the urban refugee population worldwide is very diverse, comprising a large number of women, children, and older people who have particular protection challenges. The urban refugee population face specific protecting needs attendant to urban environments: they may lack access to services, health, education and are often confronted to xenophobic attitudes in their country of asylum.

The overwhelming majority of refugees living in urban areas are to be found in the poorest and more conflict-affected regions of the world. Africa and Asia concentrate the highest number of urban refugee populations. Some war-affected countries host a huge number of both urban internally displaced people and refugees in capital cities (such as [[Kampala]] or [[Khartoum]]). Urban refugees also live in the main cities of their country of origin: after protracted exile, many returnees prefer settling back as IDPs in cities and towns of their own country upon return.

Since around 2017, the UNHCR prioritizes urban refugees for [[third country resettlement|resettlement]] over those refugees living in [[refugee camps]]. In Kenya, for example, only refugees living in Nairobi are submitted for resettlement places, and not those refugees living in [[Kakuma]] or [[Dadaab]].

==Reasons for living in urban areas==
Reasons for living in urban settings rather than in refugee camps could be specific medical care needs that can't be provided for in camps, or higher than average educational achievements and aspirations, as camps don't provide much higher education opportunities. There is insufficient physical and material security in some camps. Especially certain groups of refugees, such as [[LGBTI]] refugees and women at high risk of gender-based violence, cannot be sufficienty protected from other refugees in the camps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf|{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} page 35&lt;/ref&gt; Or it could simply the fact that the state or territory where refugees fled to does not run refugee camps (e.g. Syria or Egypt). Some refugees leave camps in search of better economic opportunities in urban centres and to avoid being dependent on aid rations. Some even move back and forth between urban centres and refugee camps to get the best of both.

A disadvantage is that the UNHCR and other aid agencies cannot legally protect and support refugees dispersed in urban settings as much as in camps.

==Notable urban refugee settlements==
* [[Damascus]], Syria: the majority of a total of around 63,000 Iraqi refugees in Syria&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iraqi-refugees-in-syria-feel-new-strains-of-war/2013/04/09/4f5cd784-9ee8-11e2-a941-a19bce7af755_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; (also see [[Iraqis in Syria]]). 
* [[Cairo]], Egypt: around 30,000 Sudanese refugees&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmreview.org/FMRpdfs/FMR27/50.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (also see [[sudanese refugees in Egypt]]).&lt;!-- as of 2015, Kenyan government requires refugees to reside in camps --&gt;
* [[Cape Town]], South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/prm/funding/fy2015/240479.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kathmandu]], Nepal: 500 Rohingya and Sri Lankan refugees as well as [[Ahmadiyyas]] from Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/bleak-outlook-nepal-urban-refugees-151123110438884.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Beirut]], Lebanon: 26,000 
* [[Kandahar]] and [[Kabul]], Afghanistan: 55,000 each
* [[Belgrade]], Serbia: 57,542 
* [[Amman]], Jordan:  162,061 
* [[Bangui]], Central African Republic: 496,731
* [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia: 62,200

In [[spatial statistics]] the theoretical '''variogram''' &lt;math&gt;2\gamma(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2)&lt;/math&gt; is a function describing the degree of spatial dependence of a spatial [[random field]] or [[stochastic process]] &lt;math&gt;Z(\mathbf{s})&lt;/math&gt;. 

In the case of a concrete example from the field of [[gold mining]], a variogram will give a measure of how much two samples taken from the mining area will vary in gold percentage depending on the distance between those samples. Samples taken far apart will vary more than samples taken close to each other.

==Definition==
===Semivariogram===
The '''semivariogram''' &lt;math&gt;\gamma(h)&lt;/math&gt; was first defined by Matheron (1963) as half the average squared difference between points (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_2&lt;/math&gt;) separated at distance &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Matheron1963"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matheron|first1=Georges|title=Principles of geostatistics|journal=Economic Geology|volume=58|issue=8|year=1963|pages=1246–1266|issn=1554-0774|doi=10.2113/gsecongeo.58.8.1246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faculty.washington.edu/edford/Variogram.pdf |title=The Empirical Variogram |last=Ford |first=David |date= |website=faculty.washington.edu/edford |publisher= |access-date=31 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formally

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma(h)=\frac{1}{2V}\iiint_V \left[f(M+h) - f(M) \right]^2dV, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a point in the geometric field &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(M)&lt;/math&gt; is the value at that point. For example, suppose we are interested in iron content in soil samples in some region or field &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;f(M)&lt;/math&gt; would be the content (e.g., in mg iron per kg soil) of iron at some location &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has coordinates of latitude, longitude, and depth. The triple integral is over 3 dimensions. &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the separation distance (e.g., in m or km) of interest. To obtain the semivariogram for a given &lt;math&gt;\gamma(h)&lt;/math&gt;, all pairs of points at that exact distance would be sampled. In practice it is impossible to sample everywhere, so the [[Variogram#Empirical_variogram|empirical variogram]] is used instead.

===Variogram===
The variogram is defined as the [[variance]] of the difference between field values at two locations (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_2&lt;/math&gt;, note change of notation from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;) across realizations of the field (Cressie 1993):

:&lt;math&gt;2\gamma(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2)=\text{var}\left(Z(\mathbf{s}_1) - Z(\mathbf{s}_2)\right) = E\left[((Z(\mathbf{s}_1)-\mu(\mathbf{s}_1))-(Z(\mathbf{s}_2) - \mu(\mathbf{s}_2)))^2\right]. &lt;/math&gt; 

or in other words is twice the semivariogram. If the spatial random field has constant mean &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, this is equivalent to the expectation for the squared increment of the values between locations &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; (Wackernagel 2003) (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_2&lt;/math&gt; are points in space and possibly time):

:&lt;math&gt;2\gamma(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2)=E\left[\left(Z(\mathbf{s}_1)-Z(\mathbf{s}_2)\right)^2\right] . &lt;/math&gt; 

In the case of a [[stationary process]], the variogram and semivariogram can be represented as a function &lt;math&gt;\gamma_s(h)=\gamma(0,0+h)&lt;/math&gt; of the difference &lt;math&gt;h=\mathbf{s}_2-\mathbf{s}_1&lt;/math&gt; between locations only, by the following relation (Cressie 1993):

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2)=\gamma_s(\mathbf{s}_2-\mathbf{s}_1).&lt;/math&gt;

If the process is furthermore [[isotropy|isotropic]], then the variogram and semivariogram can be represented by a function &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i(h):=\gamma_s(h e_1)&lt;/math&gt; of the distance  &lt;math&gt;h=\|\mathbf{s}_2-\mathbf{s}_1\|&lt;/math&gt; only (Cressie 1993):

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2)=\gamma_i(h).&lt;/math&gt;

The indexes &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are typically not written. The terms are used for all three forms of the function. Moreover, the term "variogram" is sometimes used to denote the semivariogram, and the symbol &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used for the variogram, which brings some confusion.

==Properties==
According to (Cressie 1993, Chiles and Delfiner 1999, Wackernagel 2003) the theoretical variogram has the following properties:
* The semivariogram is nonnegative &lt;math&gt;\gamma(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2)\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, since it is the expectation of a square.
* The semivariogram  &lt;math&gt;\gamma(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_1)=\gamma_i(0)=E\left((Z(\mathbf{s}_1)-Z(\mathbf{s}_1))^2\right)=0&lt;/math&gt; at distance 0  is always 0, since &lt;math&gt;Z(\mathbf{s}_1)-Z(\mathbf{s}_1)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
* A function is a semivariogram if and only if it is a conditionally negative definite function, i.e. for all weights &lt;math&gt;w_1,\ldots,w_N&lt;/math&gt; subject to &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^N w_i=0&lt;/math&gt; and locations &lt;math&gt;s_1,\ldots,s_N&lt;/math&gt; it holds:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=1}^N w_{i}\gamma(\mathbf{s}_i,\mathbf{s}_j)w_j \leq 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;which corresponds to the fact that the variance &lt;math&gt;var(X)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X=\sum_{i=1}^N w_i Z(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the negative of this double sum and must be nonnegative. {{citation needed|reason=This statement appears to be false|date=July 2016}}
* As a consequence the semivariogram might be non continuous only at the origin. The height of the jump at the origin is sometimes referred to as ''nugget'' or nugget effect. 
* If the [[covariance function]] of a stationary process exists it is related to variogram by&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;2\gamma(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2)=C(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_1)+C(\mathbf{s}_2,\mathbf{s}_2)-2C(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For a non-stationary process the square of the difference between expected values at both points must be added:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;2\gamma(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2)=C(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_1)+C(\mathbf{s}_2,\mathbf{s}_2)-2C(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2) + (E\left[Z(\mathbf{s}_1)\right]-E\left[Z(\mathbf{s}_2)\right])^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* If a stationary random field has no spatial dependence (i.e. &lt;math&gt;C(h)=0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;h\not= 0&lt;/math&gt;), the semivariogram is the constant &lt;math&gt;var(Z(\mathbf{s}))&lt;/math&gt; everywhere except at the origin, where it is zero.  
* &lt;math&gt;\gamma(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2)=E\left[|Z(\mathbf{s}_1)-Z(\mathbf{s}_2)|^2\right]=\gamma(\mathbf{s}_2,\mathbf{s}_1)&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetric function.
* Consequently, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_s(h)=\gamma_s(-h)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[even function]].
* If the random field is [[stationary process|stationary]] and [[ergodic]], the &lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to \infty} \gamma_s(h) = var(Z(\mathbf{s}))&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the variance of the field. The limit of the semivariogram is also called its ''sill''.

==Empirical variogram and application==
Generally an empirical variogram is needed, because sample information &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is not available for every location. The sample information could be concentration of iron in soil samples, pixel intensity on a camera or the property of a material.&lt;ref name="arregui18"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arregui Mena | first1 = J.D. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2018 | title = Characterisation of the spatial variability of material properties of Gilsocarbon and NBG-18 using random fields | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327537624_Characterisation_of_the_spatial_variability_of_material_properties_of_Gilsocarbon_and_NBG-18_using_random_fields | journal = Journal of Nuclear Materials | volume = 511 | issue = | pages = 91-108| doi = 10.1016/j.jnucmat.2018.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each piece of sample information has coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}=(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for a 2D sample space where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are geographical coordinates. In the case of the iron in soil, the sample space could be 3 dimensional. If there is temporal variability as well (e.g., phosphorus content in a lake) then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; could be a 4 dimensional vector &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z,t)&lt;/math&gt;. For the case where dimensions have different units (e.g., distance and time) then a scaling factor &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; can be applied to each to obtain a modified Euclidean distance.&lt;ref name="Nguyen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=H.|last2=Osterman|first2=G.|last3=Wunch|first3=D.|last4=O'Dell|first4=C.|last5=Mandrake|first5=L.|last6=Wennberg|first6=P.|last7=Fisher|first7=B.|last8=Castano|first8=R.|title=A method for colocating satellite &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; data to ground-based data and its application to ACOS-GOSAT and TCCON|journal=Atmospheric Measurement Techniques|volume=7|issue=8|year=2014|pages=2631–2644|issn=1867-8548|doi=10.5194/amt-7-2631-2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample observations are denoted &lt;math&gt;Z(\mathbf{s}_i)=z_i&lt;/math&gt;. Samples may be taken at &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; total different locations. This would provide as set of samples &lt;math&gt;z_1,\ldots,z_k&lt;/math&gt; at locations &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{s}_k&lt;/math&gt;. Generally plots show the semivariogram values as a function of sample point separation &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of empirical semivariogram, separation distance bins &lt;math&gt;h \pm \delta&lt;/math&gt; are used rather than exact distances, and usually isotropic conditions are assumed (i.e., that &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is only a function of &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and does not depend on other variables such as center position). Then, the empirical semivariogram &lt;math&gt;\hat{\gamma}(h \pm \delta)&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated for each bin:

&lt;math&gt;\hat{\gamma}(h \pm \delta):=\frac{1}{2|N(h \pm \delta)|}\sum_{(i,j)\in N(h \pm \delta)} |z_i-z_j|^2&lt;/math&gt;

Or in other words, each pair of points separated by &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; (plus or minus some bin width tolerance range &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;) are found. These form the set of points &lt;math&gt;N(h \pm \delta) \equiv \{ (\mathbf{s}_i,\mathbf{s}_j): |\mathbf{s}_i,\mathbf{s}_j| = h \pm \delta; i,j=1,\ldots,N \}&lt;/math&gt;. The number of these points in this bin is &lt;math&gt;|N(h \pm \delta)|&lt;/math&gt;. Then for each pair of points &lt;math&gt;i,j&lt;/math&gt;, the square of the difference in the observation (e.g., soil sample content or pixel intensity) is found (&lt;math&gt;|z_i-z_j|^2&lt;/math&gt;). These squared differences are added together and normalized by the natural number &lt;math&gt;|N(h \pm \delta)|&lt;/math&gt;. By definition the result is divided by 2 for the semivariogram at this separation.

For computational speed, only the unique pairs of points are needed. For example, for 2 observations pairs [&lt;math&gt;(z_a,z_b),(z_c,z_d)&lt;/math&gt;] taken from locations with separation &lt;math&gt;h \pm \delta&lt;/math&gt; only [&lt;math&gt;(z_a,z_b),(z_c,z_d)&lt;/math&gt;] need to be considered, as the pairs [&lt;math&gt;(z_b,z_a),(z_d,z_c)&lt;/math&gt;] do not provide any additional information. 

The ''empirical variogram'' is used in [[geostatistics]] as a first estimate of the (theoretical) variogram needed for spatial interpolation by [[kriging]]. 
 
According to (Cressie 1993), for observations &lt;math&gt;z_i=Z(\mathbf{s}_i)&lt;/math&gt; from a [[Stationary process|stationary]] [[random field]] &lt;math&gt;Z(\mathbf{s})&lt;/math&gt;, the empirical variogram with lag tolerance 0 is an [[unbiased estimator]] of the theoretical semivariogram, due to:

&lt;math&gt;E\left[\hat{\gamma}(h)\right]=\frac{1}{2|N(h)|}\sum_{(i,j)\in N(h)}E\left[|Z(s_i)-Z(s_j)|^2\right]=\frac{1}{2|N(h)|}\sum_{(i,j)\in N(h)}2\gamma(s_j-s_i)=\frac{2|N(h)|}{2|N(h)|}\gamma(h)&lt;/math&gt;

==Variogram parameters==

The following parameters are often used to describe variograms:

* ''nugget'' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;: The height of the jump of the semivariogram at the discontinuity at the origin. 
* ''sill'' &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;: Limit of the variogram tending to infinity lag distances.  
* ''range'' &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;: The distance in which the difference of the variogram from the sill becomes negligible. In models with a fixed sill, it is the distance at which this is first reached; for models with an asymptotic sill, it is conventionally taken to be the distance when the semivariance first reaches 95% of the sill.

==Variogram models==

The empirical variogram cannot be computed at every lag distance &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and due to variation in the estimation it is not ensured that it is a valid variogram, as defined above. However some [[geostatistics|Geostatistical]] methods such as [[kriging]] need valid semivariograms. In applied geostatistics the empirical variograms are thus often approximated by model function ensuring validity (Chiles&amp;Delfiner 1999). Some important models are (Chiles&amp;Delfiner 1999, Cressie 1993): 

* The exponential variogram model 

:: &lt;math&gt;\gamma(h)=(s-n)(1-\exp(-h/(ra)))+n 1_{(0,\infty)}(h)&lt;/math&gt;

* The spherical variogram model 

:: &lt;math&gt;\gamma(h)=(s-n)\left(\left(\frac{3h}{2r}-\frac{h^3}{2r^3}\right)1_{(0,r)}(h)+1_{[r,\infty)}(h)\right)+n1_{(0,\infty)}(h)&lt;/math&gt;

* The Gaussian variogram model 

:: &lt;math&gt;\gamma(h)=(s-n)\left(1-\exp\left(-\frac{h^2}{r^2a}\right)\right) + n1_{(0,\infty)}(h)&lt;/math&gt;

The parameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; has different values in different references, due to the ambiguity in the definition of the range. E.g. &lt;math&gt;a=1/3&lt;/math&gt; is the value used in (Chiles&amp;Delfiner 1999). The &lt;math&gt;1_A(h)&lt;/math&gt; function is 1 if &lt;math&gt;h\in A&lt;/math&gt; and 0 otherwise.

==Discussion==
{{Uncited-section|date=May 2015}}
Three functions are used in [[geostatistics]] for describing the spatial or the temporal correlation of observations: these are the [[correlogram]], the [[covariance]] and the '''semivariogram'''. The last is also more simply called '''variogram'''. The [[sampling variogram]], unlike the semivariogram and the variogram, shows where a significant degree of spatial dependence in the sample space or sampling unit dissipates into randomness when the variance terms of a temporally or ''in-situ'' ordered set are plotted against the variance of the set and the lower limits of its 99% and 95% confidence ranges.

The variogram is the key function in [[geostatistics]] as it will be used to fit a model of the temporal/[[spatial correlation]] of the observed phenomenon. One is thus making a distinction between the ''experimental variogram'' that is a visualisation of a possible spatial/temporal correlation and the ''variogram model'' that is further used to define the weights of the [[kriging]] function. Note that the experimental variogram is an empirical estimate of the [[covariance]] of a [[Gaussian process]]. As such, it may not be [[positive definite]] and hence not directly usable in [[kriging]], without constraints or further processing. This explains why only a limited number of variogram models are used: most commonly, the linear, the spherical, the Gaussian and the exponential models. 

==Related concepts==

The squared term in the variogram, for instance &lt;math&gt;(Z(\mathbf{s}_1) - Z(\mathbf{s}_2))^2&lt;/math&gt;, can be replaced with different powers: A ''madogram'' is defined with the [[absolute difference]], &lt;math&gt;|Z(\mathbf{s}_1) - Z(\mathbf{s}_2)|&lt;/math&gt;, and a ''rodogram'' is defined with the [[square root]] of the absolute difference, &lt;math&gt;|Z(\mathbf{s}_1) - Z(\mathbf{s}_2)|^{0.5}&lt;/math&gt;. [[Estimator]]s based on these lower powers are said to be more [[resistant statistics|resistant]] to [[outlier]]s. They can be generalized as a "variogram of order ''α''",

:&lt;math&gt;2\gamma(\mathbf{s}_1,\mathbf{s}_2)=E\left[\left|Z(\mathbf{s}_1)-Z(\mathbf{s}_2)\right|^\alpha\right]&lt;/math&gt;,

in which a variogram is of order 2, a madogram is a variogram of order 1, and a rodogram is a variogram of order 0.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geostatistical Glossary and Multilingual Dictionary |pages=47, 67, 81 |first=Ricardo A. |last=Olea |isbn=9780195066890 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a variogram is used to describe the correlation of different variables it is called ''cross-variogram''. Cross-variograms are used in [[co-kriging]].
Should the variable be binary or represent classes of values, one is then talking about ''indicator variograms''. Indicator variogram is used in [[indicator kriging]].

The '''Vienna Institute of Demography (VID)''' (until 2002: Institut für Demographie/IfD) is a research institute of the division for humanities and social sciences within the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] (ÖAW)&lt;ref&gt;[http://wissenschaft.bmwfw.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/forschung/OEAW-Forschungsinstitute_Feb._2015.pdf List of Academy institutes published by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; and part of the three "''pillar institutions''" of the [[Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1295571237693/Ehrgeizig-Wiener-Wittgenstein-Center-will-an-Spitze-der-Demographie-Institute ''Der Standard'', 31. January 2011: "Vienna Wittgenstein Centre aims for top position among demography institutes worldwide" (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

After some groundwork by researchers interested in having a population studies institute in Austria, among them [[Wilhelm Winkler]] and Gustav Feichtinger, the ''Institut für Demographie'' was established in November 1975 as a non-university research institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in close cooperation with the Austrian Statistical Central Office (now [[Statistik Austria]]). Founding director was Lothar Bosse (1914–1996), a German-born philosopher, mathematician and economist who remained at the head of IfD for twelve years. In the first few years, research activities were limited by budget restrictions and focussed on ''theory and basic research'' as well as ''applied demography''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/29734814 ''European Demographic Information Bulletin'' (December 1979), Volume 10, Issue 4, pp. 163–164]&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, there was an emphasis on informing the public about population issues and research results, by publications such as "''Demographische Informationen''" (since 1981, in German with English abstracts).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/16/035/16035469.pdf Activity Report of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, chapter on IfD on p.222ff. (published in the IAEA archive)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosse was succeeded by [[Richard Gisser]] who headed the institute 1987–1989 and again 1993–2001 (interim directorship was taken by social scientist Rainer Münz) and continues to be the institute’s deputy director and a leader of the research group on ''Demography of Austria''.

In the period of 1985 to 2000, the institute and the research topic of demography received increasing attention, though there was some competition for scientific staff with the newly founded [[Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]] in Rostock, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23026758 "Twenty Years Institute of Demography: Activities 1987–1996", in: ''Demographische Informationen'' (1995/96), pp. 5-8 (JSTOR quotation)]&lt;/ref&gt;

After positive independent evaluations and the commitment of special funds, the ÖAW decided to substantially expand and internationalise the institute in 2001. Under the designated new director [[Wolfgang Lutz]], the IfD changed its name and working language, employed more scientific and administrative staff, expanded its research agenda as well as its publication efforts and moved to new and successively larger premises in the 4th district (2002–2007 at Prinz-Eugen-Strasse 8-10, then 2007–2015 at Wohllebengasse 12-14).

Research activity at VID continued to expand and received favourable attention by policy-makers and scientific peers, which showed in VID members participating in or coordinating major research projects, for instance within the European Union’s [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Framework Programmes]], and obtaining recognition by being awarded sizeable grants from the [[European Research Council]] (ERC). Director Wolfgang Lutz received the [[Wittgenstein Award]] in 2010 and, with the 1.5 million euro prize money, established the ''Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital''.

At its 40th anniversary in 2015, VID moved to the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business|WU]] campus in Vienna’s 2nd district,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wu.ac.at/en/press/press-releases/press-releases-details/detail/wu-welcomes-the-austrian-academy-of-sciences-to-its-new-department-building-5/|title=WU welcomes the Austrian Academy of Sciences to its new Department Building 5|work=WU (Vienna University of Economics and Business)|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating this and other occasions with a symposium on "Demography that Matters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tt.com/home/10463868-91/multiple-jubil%C3%A4en-f%C3%BCr-wiener-demographie.csp ''Tiroler Tageszeitung'' of 4 September 2015: "Multiple anniversaries for Vienna’s Demography"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dstatg.de/en/home/aktuelle-news/article/40-years-vienna-institute-of-demography-symposium-demography-that-matters/ Announcement by the German Statistical Society (DStatG)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research activities ==

VID employs about 40 researchers, most of them from the fields of [[economics]], [[mathematics]]/[[statistics]], [[geography]], health studies and [[sociology]], to cover the major research topics of [[demography]] or population science: [[fertility]], [[mortality rate|mortality]] and [[human migration|migration]] as well as a number of other fields of interest. Over time, the institute’s research focus has expanded from its core competences in Austrian and later European demography to a global perspective on the relevant issues of population and human capital development.&lt;ref name="40years" /&gt;

There are seven main areas of research, assigned to different research groups though there is considerable permeability and cooperation:

* Demography of Austria (led by Richard Gisser and Isabella Buber-Ennser)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ggp-austria.at/fileadmin/ggp-austria/Publikationen/ggp_brochure_austria_2013_english.pdf ''Families in Austria'', results of the Generations and Gender Survey 2009–2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacques Élisée Reclus''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁəkly|lang}}; 15 March 1830 &amp;ndash; 4 July 1905) was a renowned [[French people|French]] [[geographer]], writer and [[anarchist]]. He produced his 19-volume masterwork, ''La Nouvelle Géographie universelle, la terre et les hommes'' ("Universal Geography"), over a period of nearly 20 years (1875–1894). In 1892 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the [[Société de Géographie|Paris Geographical Society]] for this work, despite having been banished from France because of his political activism.

==Biography==
Reclus was born at [[Sainte-Foy-la-Grande]] ([[Gironde]]). He was the second son of a [[Protestant]] pastor and his wife. From the family of fourteen children, several brothers, including fellow geographers [[Onésime Reclus|Onésime]] and [[Élie Reclus]], went on to achieve renown either as [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]], politicians or members of the learned professions.

Reclus began his education in [[Rhenish Prussia]], and continued higher studies at the Protestant college of [[Montauban]]. He completed his studies at [[University of Berlin]], where he followed a long course of geography under [[Carl Ritter]].

Withdrawing from France due to the political events of December 1851, as a young man he spent the next six years (1852–1857) traveling and working in [[Great Britain]], the [[United States]], [[Central America]], and [[Colombia]]. Arriving in [[Louisiana]] in 1853, Reclus worked for about two and a half years as a tutor to the children of cousin Septime and Félicité Fortier at their plantation Félicité, located about {{convert|50|mile|order=flip}} upriver from [[New Orleans]]. He recounted his passage through the [[Mississippi River Delta]] and impressions of antebellum New Orleans and the state in ''Fragment d'un voyage á Louisiane'', published in 1855.&lt;ref name=mesechabe/&gt;

On his return to Paris, Reclus contributed to the ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'', the ''Tour du monde'' and other periodicals, a large number of articles embodying the results of his geographical work. Among other works of this period was the short book ''Histoire d'un ruisseau'', in which he traced the development of a great river from source to mouth. During 1867 and 1868, he published ''La Terre; description des phénomènes de la vie du globe'' in two volumes.
[[File:Le Cri du Peuple - Elisée Reclus.JPG|thumb|left|Reclus reading ''[[Le Cri du Peuple]]'' in the garden of his home in Brussels, ca. 1894–1905]]
During the [[Siege of Paris (1870–1871)]], Reclus shared in the [[aerostat]]ic operations conducted by [[Félix Nadar]], and also served in the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]]. As a member of the [[Association Nationale des Travailleurs]], he published a hostile manifesto against the government of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] in support of the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 in the ''[[Cri du Peuple]]''.

Continuing to serve in the National Guard, which was then in open revolt, Reclus was taken prisoner on 5 April. On 16 November he was sentenced to deportation for life. Because of intervention by supporters from England, the sentence was commuted in January 1872 to perpetual banishment from France.

After a short visit to [[Italy]], Reclus settled at [[Clarens, Switzerland]], where he resumed his literary labours and produced ''Histoire d'une montagne'', a companion to ''Histoire d'un ruisseau''.  There he wrote nearly the whole of his work, ''La Nouvelle Géographie universelle, la terre et les hommes'', "an examination of every continent and country in terms of the effects that geographic features like rivers and mountains had on human populations—and vice versa,"&lt;ref name=Sale&gt;[[Kirkpatrick Sale|Sale, Kirkpatrick]] (2010-07-01) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00045/ "Are Anarchists Revolting?"], ''[[The American Conservative]]'', 1 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This compilation was profusely illustrated with maps, plans, and engravings. It was awarded the gold medal of the [[Paris Geographical Society]] in 1892. An English edition was published simultaneously, also in 19 volumes, the first four by translated [[E. G. Ravenstein]], the rest by [[A. H. Keane]]. Reclus's writings were characterized by extreme accuracy and brilliant exposition, which gave them permanent literary and scientific value.

According to [[Kirkpatrick Sale]]:&lt;ref name=Sale/&gt;
{{quote|His geographical work, thoroughly researched and unflinchingly scientific, laid out a picture of human-nature interaction that we today would call [[bioregionalism]]. It showed, with more detail than anyone but a dedicated geographer could possibly absorb, how the ecology of a place determined the kinds of lives and livelihoods its denizens would have and thus how people could properly live in self-regarding and self-determined bioregions without the interference of large and centralized governments that always try to homogenize diverse geographical areas.}}

In 1882, Reclus initiated the [[Criticism of marriage|Anti-Marriage]] Movement. In accordance with these beliefs and the practice of ''union libre'' ("free unions"), which was common among working-class French in the mid-to-late 1800s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McPhee |first1=Peter |title=A Social History of France 1780-1914: |date=2004 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |page=195 |edition=Second }}&lt;/ref&gt;, Reclus allowed his two daughters to "marry" their male partners without any civil or religious ceremonies, an action causing embarrassment to many of his well-wishers. Reclus had himself entered a free union in 1872, after the death of his first wife. In 1882 he also wrote ''Unions Libres,'' a pamphlet which detailed his anarchist and feminist objections to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ferretti |first1=Federico |title=Anarchist geographers and feminism in late 19th cen- tury France:   the contributions of Elisée and Elie Reclus |journal=Feminist Historical Geographi |volume=44 |page=68-88 |url=https://ejournals.unm.edu/index.php/historicalgeography/article/view/353}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French government initiated prosecution from the High Court of [[Lyon]], arrested him and [[Peter Kropotkin]] as the International Association's organizers, and sentenced the latter to five years' imprisonment. Reclus escaped punishment as he remained in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="landuyt"&gt;[http://antwerpjamesjoycecenter.com/fleuve.html Ingeborg Landuyt and Geert Lernout, "Joyce's Sources: Les Grands Fleuves Historiques"], originally published in ''Joyce Studies,'' Annual 6 (1995): 99–138&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclus had strong views on [[naturism]] and the benefits of [[nudity]].  He argued that living naked was more hygienic than wearing clothes; he believed that it was healthier for skin to be fully exposed to light and air so that it could resume its "natural vitality and activity" and become more flexible and firm at the same time. He also argued that from an aesthetic point of view, nudity was better: naked people were more beautiful.  His principal objection to clothing was, however, a moral one; he felt that a fixation with clothing caused excessive focus on what was covered.&lt;ref name="Reclus2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reclus|first=Elisée |editor1-first=John P. |editor1-last=Clark|editor2-first=Camille |editor2-last=Martin|title=Anarchy, Geography, Modernity: The Radical Social Thought of Elisée Reclus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dge71MovfE0C&amp;pg=PA107|year=2004|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7391-0805-5|pages=107–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="l'HetT" /&gt;{{rp|[http://kropot.free.fr/Reclus-naturisme.htm 485]}}

[[File:ÉliséeReclus1905.png|thumb|right|Élisée Reclus]]
In 1894, Reclus was appointed chair of comparative geography at the [[University of Brussels]], and moved with his family to Belgium. His brother [[Élie Reclus]] was at the university already, teaching religion.&lt;ref name="landuyt"/&gt; Élisée Reclus continued to write, contributing several important articles and essays to French, German and English scientific journals. He was awarded the 1894 [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]].&lt;ref name="rgs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, shortly before his death, Reclus completed ''L'Homme et la terre'', in which he rounded out his previous works by considering humanity's development relative to its geographical environment.&lt;ref name="l'HetT"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lhommeetlaterre00reclgoog|first= Élisée |last=Reclus|title=L'Homme et la terre|date=1905|location=Paris|volume=Tome VI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Reclus married and had a family, including two daughters.

He died at [[Torhout]], near [[Bruges]], Belgium.

==Legacy==
Reclus was admired by many prominent 19th century thinkers, including [[Alfred Russel Wallace]],&lt;ref name=wallace/&gt; [[George Perkins Marsh]] and [[Patrick Geddes]],&lt;ref name=geddes/&gt; [[Henry Stephens Salt]],&lt;ref name=salt/&gt; and [[Octave Mirbeau]].&lt;ref name=mirbeau/&gt; [[James Joyce]] was influenced by Reclus' book ''La civilisation et les grands fleuves historiques''.

Reclus advocated [[nature conservation]] and opposed meat-eating and cruelty to animals. He was a [[vegetarian]].&lt;ref name=vegetarian/&gt; As a result, his ideas are seen by some historians and writers as anticipating the modern [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] and [[animal rights]] movements.&lt;ref name=demanding/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Vegetarian Communard | last = Hochschartner | first = Jon | work = [[CounterPunch]] | date = 19 March 2014 | accessdate = 2017-04-05 | url = http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/19/the-vegetarian-communard/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
