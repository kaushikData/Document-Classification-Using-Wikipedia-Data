      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3337">The '''All-Union Council on physical culture and sports''' ({{lang-ru|Всесоюзный совет физической культуры}}) was a main body of Soviet executive power in physical culture and sports originally established in August of 1920 as part of the Soviet [[vsevobuch]]. In 1936 it was transformed into All-Union committee and State committee.

At first it was established as interdepartamental commission that included representatives of [[Vseobuch]], [[People's Commissariat of Enlightenment]], [[People's Commissariat of Healthcare]], trade unions, Russian League of Communist Youth (RKSM, later known as [[Komsomol]]), and sports-gymnastics societies. It also was a consultative agency to Vseobuch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140219024553/http://www.minsport.gov.ru/ministry/structure/90-let-minsportu/3696/ All Russian Central Executive Committee of the Soviet of workers, soldiers and peasants deputies (Всероссийский Центральный Исполнительный Комитет Совета рабочих, солдатских и крестьянских депутатов)]. Ministry of Sports (Russian Federation).&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1923 and until 1936 it was a special agency of the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union]].

Its main duties included
* development and review of programs, provisions, regulations, and guidelines on physical education;
* organization and holding of sports competitions;
* general management of sports organizations;
* preparation of physical culture cadres (staff);
* monitoring of the physical education of students;
* medical control over the health of those engaged in physical culture and sports.

'''Cabo Verde Express''' is a [[Cape verde|Cape Verdean]] [[regional airline]] headquartered in [[Espargos]] and based at [[Amílcar Cabral International Airport]] operating domestic scheduled and charter services. 

==History==
It was established in 1998 by Jean-Christophe Bartz, airline transport pilot and business man with many interests within the airline industry in West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aircharterguide.com/Operator_Info/CABO_VERDE_EXPRESS/60856/SAL/49521 Company Profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930172806/http://www.aircharterguide.com/Operator_Info/CABO_VERDE_EXPRESS/60856/SAL/49521# |date=2011-09-30 }}. aircharterguide.com, retrieved 24 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Operations started with a single [[Cessna Caravan]] (D4-CBJ). A few months later the Czech-made [[Let L-410 Turbolet]] were introduced. The airline employed 14 pilots including 2 freelancers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caboverdeexpress.com/en/cape-verde/airplane.php Aeroplane type of Cabo Verde Express]. caboverdeexpress.com, retrieved 24 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

The little airline grew fast under the command of Captain JC Bartz and actively contributed to the tourism development on the island of Boa Vista. Captain JC Bartz sold the airline back in 2007 to the Portuguese group Omni Aviacao, the owner of [[White Airways]]. Its head office is at the Amílcar Cabral International Airport in [[Espargos]], [[Sal (island)|Sal]].

'''Correios de Cabo Verde''' (Portuguese for Post of Cape Verde) is the company responsible for [[mail|postal service]] in [[Cape Verde]]. The headquarters of the company are in the [[Plateau (Praia)|city centre]] of [[Praia]], at Rua Cesário Lacerda, nº 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.correios.cv/conteudo.aspx?id=1604 Contactos], Correios de Cabo Verde&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During Portuguese rule in Cape Verde which lasted until 1975, all postal services were done by [[Correios de Portugal]] (Portuguese Post). Its first post office was opened in Praia in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correios.cv/conteudo.aspx?id=1588&amp;cid=1606 |title=Correios De Cabo Verde |publisher=Correios.cv |date= |accessdate=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under law no. 9-A/95 made on 16 February 1995, the public company of posts and telecommunications (Empresa Pública dos Correios e Telecomunicaçöes, (CTT-EP) was split into two: Correios de Cabo Verde (postal service) and [[Cabo Verde Telecom]] (telecommunications). Both became [[Limited liability company|anonymous societies with limited responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.correios.cv/conteudo.aspx?id=1588&amp;cid=1606 Quem somos], Correios de Cabo Verde&lt;/ref&gt;

==Street names and numbers==
More than 90% of Cape Verdean roads don't have names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rinckes |first1=Doug |title=Delivering mail where streets have no name |url=https://africa.googleblog.com/2016/12/delivering-mail-where-streets-have-no.html |website=Official Google Africa Blog |publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, most people use community post boxes. To enable delivery at home, the [[Open Location Code]] system invented by [[Google]] has officially been adopted by the Cape Verdean post, including a system on their website to officially link their home location with personal data at the post office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Morada Certa |url=http://www.correios.cv/conteudo.aspx?id=1786&amp;cid=1803 |website=www.correios.cv |publisher=Correios Cabo Verde |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Danish Social Service Law''', '''Serviceloven''', properly ''Lov om social service'',  is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[law]] which specifies guidelines for advice and support both in order to prevent [[social problem]]s and to provide services to people with physical or mental disabilities or particular social problems.

The first version of the law was passed in 1998, but it is typically revised several times a year, {{As of|2014|06|19|lc=yes}} most recently on 10 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/r0710.aspx?id=163646 "Lov om ændring af lov om social service og lov om forpligtende kommunale samarbejder"], LOV nr 576 § 1, 10 June 2014; [https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/r0710.aspx?id=163647 "Lov om ændring af lov om social service"], LOV nr 577, 10 June 2014, at retsinformation.dk {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends attribute to him building of the town of [[Duklja (town)|Duklja]],&lt;ref name=SMR/&gt; [[Dukljan's border]],&lt;ref name=SMR/&gt; and the [[Roman road#Milestones|Roman milestones]] near [[Tuzi]] (according to a folktale, he was throwing them at his brother and sister as they were fleeing to [[Zahumlje|Hum]]).&lt;ref name=SMR/&gt;

Several variants of a story that he is still alive exist; according to them he is chained in the [[Morača]] river near [[Duklja (town)|Duklja]] (the [[Vizier's bridge]]).&lt;ref name=SMR/&gt; In some of them, he constantly gnaws at his chains, and each year around [[Christmas]] (or around [[Đurđevdan]]) nearly manages to break free and destroy the world, when four [[Romani people|Gypsy]] [[blacksmith]]s reforge the chains.&lt;ref name=SMR/&gt;

'''''Egypt Carrying the Light to Asia''''', also known as '''''Progress Carrying the Light to Asia''''' or '''pedestal committee'''; was a plan for a colossal [[neoclassical sculpture]]. Designed in the late 1860s by [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]], a French sculptor, the project was to be a statue of a robed female figure bearing a torch at the entryway of the [[Suez Canal]] in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Khan2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=Yasmin Sabina |title=Enlightening the World: The Creation of the Statue of Liberty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0W2mNOrpJUC|year=2010|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-4851-4|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabamericanhistory.org/archives/the-statue-of-liberty-story-from-egypt-to-new-york/|title=The Statue of Liberty Story, From Egypt to New York {{!}} The Arab American Historical Foundation Home|website=www.arabamericanhistory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the khedive and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps|Lessups]] declined the proposed statue from Bartholdi, citing the expensive cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A.

In the 1880s Bartholdi designed and built ''Liberty Enlightening the World'', which became known as the [[Statue of Liberty]], and placed it in [[New York Harbor]] in the [[United States]].

The '''United States Embassy in Poland''' is situated on [[Ujazdów Avenue]] in [[Warsaw]], Poland.

During [[World War II]], the United States kept relations with the [[Polish government-in-exile]].

{{Culture of South Ossetia}}
The flag used by the [[South Ossetia|Republic of South Ossetia]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{South Ossetia-note}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[North Ossetia-Alania|Republic of North Ossetia–Alania]] is a [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]], top to bottom [[white]], [[red]], and [[yellow]]. The flag is also said to represent the social structure of ancient [[Ossetia]]n society, which was divided into three social groups forming an organic whole: the military aristocracy, the clergy, and ordinary people. The colours symbolise moral purity (white), martial courage (red) and wealth and prosperity (yellow). In [[blazon]]s, the flag is described as ''Per fess Argent and Or, a fess Gules''. The South Ossetian version was prescribed by the South Ossetian Constitution of 26 November 1990 and confirmed by the Regulation on the National Flag of 30 March 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliamentrso.org/node/8|title=Государственная символика Республики Южная Осетия {{!}} Парламент Республики Южная Осетия|website=www.parliamentrso.org|language=ru|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag was created by South Ossetian historian and former leader of the Adamon Nykhas ({{lang-os|Адæмон Ныхас}}, literally ''national assembly'')  independence movement [[Alan Chochiev]] and was firstly used as an emblem of this movement.

The flag is also used by the pro-Georgian [[Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia]], formerly based in [[Kurta, Georgia|Kurta]], which opposes the Russian-backed separatist government in [[Tskhinvali]].

The flags of North Ossetia-Alania and South Ossetia are almost identical, the only difference being the shades used. The flag of South Ossetia has identical proportions to the flag of North Ossetia-Alania (1:2), but slightly different colours (most noticeably a darker shade of yellow).

Under the [[Soviet Union]], North Ossetia had a predominantly red flag with a blue trim on the left edge, the hammer and sickle and the words "North Ossetian ASSR" in both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ossetian language|Ossetian]]. Shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was replaced with the present flag, which was adopted on October 2, 1991.

'''Hørsholm Windmill''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]. Hørsholm Mølle) is a [[smock mill]] located in [[Hørsholm]] to the north of [[Copenhagen]], Denmark. The site also comprises two storage buildings. The complex is now home to a small museum of old crafts.

==History==
The windmill was constructed in 1890&amp;ndash;91 by mill builder Martin Johansen. ItWind power was already falling out of facour and it was supplemented by a steam engine in 1895 and by a diesel engine from 1914. One large and two small electrical engines were installed in about 1940 and the complex was from then on used for production of chicken ffeed. It was decommissioned in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horsholmhf.dk/side7.html|title=Hørsholm Mølle|language=Danish|website=Håndværkerforeningen|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moellearkivet.dk/egeskov-mlle|title=HØRSHOLM MØLLE, Ved Møllen 8, 2970 Hørsholm|language=Danish|website=Moellearkivet.dk|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The windmill consists of an octagonal tower clad in [[wood shingle|shingles]] and topped by an ogee cap. The cap carries the four [[windmill sail#Common sails|Common sails]]. It is winded by a fantail. The mill stands on a dressed brick case, which has an underpass for wagons.

==Today==
The windmill is now home to a small museum of traditional crafts. It was opened by the Association of Craftsmen in Copenhagen. The premises are also rented out for exhibitions and other events.

The organisation was founded by the Swiss advocate [[Théodore Aubert]] and Russian émigré Red Cross leader Georges Lodygensky as a response to the [[Communist International]] in 1924.&lt;ref name ="New Perspective"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Durham |first1=Martin |last2=Power | first2=Margaret  |date=2010 |title=New Perspectives on the Transnational Right |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_hjDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26 |location=Google Books |publisher=Palgrave McMillan |pages=26–31 |isbn=0230115527 |access-date=3 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its objectives were to defend the "principles of order, family, property and nationality".&lt;ref name ="New Perspective" /&gt;
 
The entente had national chapters in over 20 countries, with the aim of influencing political and journalistic circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Courtois |first=Stéphane |date= 2007 |title=Dictionnaire du communisme |url= |location= |publisher= |page=93 |isbn=978-2035837820 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British chapter was the Central Council of the [[Economic League (United Kingdom)|Economic League]]s.&lt;ref name ="New Perspective" /&gt; In Finland, the national chapter ''Suomen Suojelusliitto'' was founded by the prominent statesman [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] a year earlier in 1923 to do anti-communist education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/pieni/4/0246.html Pieni Tietosanakirja IV.

'''Maman Brigitte''' ([[English Language|English]]: ''Mother Brigitte'') also written '''Gran Brigitte, Grann Brigitte''', '''Manman''', '''Manman Brigit''', and '''Maman Brijit''', is a death [[loa]] and the wife of [[Baron Samedi]] in [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]]. She drinks rum infused with hot peppers and is symbolized by a black rooster. Like Samedi and the [[Ghede]], she is foul-mouthed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meta-religion.com/World_Religions/Voodoo/ancestors.htm "The Ancestral Lwa - Baron, Maman Brigitte, And The Lwa Ghede"], Meta Religion.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the adoptive mother of [[Ghede Nibo]].

Brigitte is the only [[White people|white]] Voodoo god, having her origins in [[Ireland]], and not in [[Africa]] or [[Haiti]] like other loa.&lt;ref&gt;Max Sparber, [http://www.happyhooligan.co/2014/10/irish-american-halloween-irish-voodoo/ "Irish-American Halloween: Irish Voodoo"], The Happy Hooligan, 20 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She is described having brown or red-gold hair and emerald green eyes, and is associated with [[Brigid]], the [[Celtic deities|Celtic goddess]] of healing and life.

She protects gravestones in cemeteries if they are properly marked with a cross. Horses, weeping willows, fire, and elm trees are considered sacred to her.

A New World loa, Maman Brigitte is syncretized with various saints, including [[St. Brigit|Saint]] [[Brigid#Brigid and Saint Brigid|Brigid]] and [[Mary Magdalene]].

'''Marinette''' is a [[loa]] of power and violence in [[Haitian Vodou]]. In her [[Petro loa|petro]] form she is called ''Marinette Bras Cheche'' (Marinette of the Dry Arms) or ''Marinette Pied Cheche'' (Marinette of the Dry Feet) suggesting that she is [[skeleton|skeletal]].  

She is believed to be the [[Mambo (Voodoo)|Mambo]] who sacrificed the black pig at the culmination of the start of the first [[Haitian Revolution]].  While she is feared and tends to ride those she [[Spirit possession|possesses]] violently, she can also be seen as one who frees her people from bondage.

Marinette is represented by a [[screech owl]] and is often seen as the protector of [[werewolves]].  Her [[Catholic]] counterpart is the [[Anima Sola]] ([[Purgatory|Forsaken Soul]]) who can either free one from bondage or drag you back. Her colors are black and deep blood red. Her offerings are black [[pig]]s and black [[rooster]]s plucked alive.

Mambo Marinette is not cruel. She only gets cruel in possession, when people burn animals or humans. Her colors are red and black. She likes Salvia, black pepper, lavender and sweets.

==In popular culture==

Marinette is a main character in Rem Oscuro's book ''I am the Dark''.

FLÏRT, a band from Hamburg, Germany, refers to Marinette in the song "Marinette of the Dry Feet".

Marinette the main antagonist in the DC Comics Series Ragman - Cry of the Dead.

Marinette, or Her Lady of the Dry Arms, appears in "The Bruja" by Michael Molisani.

The festival invites international and local experts from the fields of creative industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festival.mikser.rs/en/about-mikser-house/ |title=About Mikser House - Mikser Festival 2017 |publisher=Festival.mikser.rs |date= |accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to lectures, competitions, and workshops, there are exhibits, concerts, films and theater plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festival.mikser.rs/en/complete-programme/ |title=Complete Programme - Mikser Festival 2017 |publisher=Festival.mikser.rs |date= |accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==About==
The festival occurs once a year in [[Belgrade]] at the end of May or the beginning of June, and usually lasts about 4 to 7 days. The first show was held at the "Žitomlina" silo in the [[Dorćol]] area of [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref name="blic.rs"/&gt; Since then, the festival regularly took place in the once derelict industrial zone of [[Savamala]],  helping revitalize the [[Belgrade]] neighborhood, before returning to [[Dorćol]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=VL-aDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=mikser+festival+2008&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fn_ZVJNUv8&amp;sig=r4OCin_0-nn7HSYuCEeZtKlzdq0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV26nN06PbAhWrq1kKHXrXA9Q4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mikser+festival+2008&amp;f=false|title=The Impact of Artists on Contemporary Urban Development in Europe|first1=Monika|last1=Murzyn-Kupisz|first2=Jarosław|last2=Działek|date=4 April 2017|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, the festival attracted 40,000 visitors and in 2017, the numbers had risen to 75,000.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

The Misker Festival is part of the Mikser umbrella organization, which includes the Mikser House, a gallery and cultural space located in the [[Savamala]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/17/world/europe/hip-belgrade-resilient-capital/index.html|title=Hip Belgrade: Resilient capital finds new energy to rebuild once again|first=Paula Newton,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The umbrella group also comprises the reMiks Studio, Mikser TV, the Mikser Organization, the Miksalište Refugee Center, the Mikser Café and the Balkan Design store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scen.uns.ac.rs/?p=20460|title=SCENLAB RAZGOVORI / SEZONA 5: ŠTA RADIM I ŠTA MI SE DOGAĐA, Maja Vidaković Lalić, arhitekta i kreativni direktor – SCEN|website=www.scen.uns.ac.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mikser Festival also sometimes coordinates with other events. In 2006, it's Ghost Project exhibit was shown at [[Belgrade Design Week]]. A multimedia installation, Ghost Project first focused on local unrealized projects in industrial design and since 2011 has evolved into a competition for international designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designaustria.at/posts/3078-mikser-festival-international-design-competition-ghost-project-2017|title=Mikser Festival: International Design Competition »Ghost Project 2017« - designaustria|website=www.designaustria.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mikser-remiks.blogspot.com/search/label/Ghost%2Bproject|title=Mikser|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festival.mikser.rs/en/project/ghost-project-2017-new-nomads/ |title=Exhibition: Ghost Project 2017 - The new nomads - Mikser Festival 2017 |publisher=Festival.mikser.rs |date= |accessdate=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inhabitat.com/designcompetitions/ghost-project-international-design-competition-2011/|title=Ghost Project International Design Competition 2011 - Design Competitions|website=inhabitat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highlights==
The main theme of the 2011 festival was the promotion of workshops, new technologies, and experimentation, as well as commemorating the 20 year anniversary of the break-up of [[Yugoslavia]]. Musicians who had been popular before the break-up were invited to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/festival/1929925+Mikser+festival+2011|title=Mikser festival 2011 at Žitomlin magacini (Beograd) on 25 May 2011  - Last.fm|website=Last.fm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greg Wilson (DJ)|Greg Wilson]], [[John Tejada]], JD Twitch and JG Wilkes, from the British club scene, also made appearances.

Nr. 34, 07 prill 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Christian]] faith that views [[Jesus Christ]] as its founder and head, and the [[Bible]] (especially the [[New Testament]]) as its written authority. [[Evangelical]] [[Protestants]] in Albania numbered approximately 8,000 in 1998.&lt;ref name="Christianity Today"&gt;{{cite web

Most, but not all Evangelical/Protestant groups are members of the Albania's Evangelical Brotherhood (VUSH), a cooperative organization which views itself as existing as "an instrument of blessing … with the purpose of promoting unity amongst the churches, representing every local church with dignity, and promoting evangelism."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vush.org (official website)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On August 26, 1816, [[Robert Pinkerton]] wrote the [[British and Foreign Bible Society|British and Foreign and Bible Society]] to encourage them to translate the New Testament into [[Albanian language|Albanian]].&lt;ref&gt;The Thirteenth Annual Report of the British and Foreign Bible Society, 1817, p. 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyrus Hamlin]] reported in 1857 that Albanians were applying to his Protestant seminary.&lt;ref&gt;ABCFM Annual Report, 1857, Boston, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented Albanian Protestant was [[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]], who left his native Orthodox faith and converted to Protestantism on his own while comparing Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Protestant theological texts. He joined the Protestant Church of Smyrna in 1856 or 1857, and was sent to Istanbul for theological training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first="Smyrna Station". : 20–21. 1857.|date=1857|title=Smyrna Station|url=|journal=The Gospel in Turkey: being the third annual report of the Turkish Missions-Aid Society|volume=|pages=20-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bitola|Monastir]], [[Gjerasim Qiriazi]] also converted to Protestantism ca. 1876–1877, and united with the multi-ethnic Protestant church there. The first two known Albanian Protestant-Evangelical churches were both established by Gjerasim Qiriazi, first in Monastir in 1884 and later in [[Korça]] in 1890 (both cities then part of the Ottoman Empire).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lëvizja Protestant ndër shqiptarët, 1816–1908|last=Hosaflook|first=David|publisher=Universiteti i Tiranës (disertacion)|year=2017|isbn=|location=Tirana|pages=216–219, 240–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1890, Gjerasim Qiriazi was ordained as the first Albanian evangelist and preacher by the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] in the board's annual meeting help in Monastir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lëvizja Protestant ndër shqiptarët, 1816–1908|last=Hosaflook|first=David|publisher=Universiteti i Tiranës|year=2017|isbn=|location=Tirana|pages=240–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second church among Albanians was opened in [[Korça]]. Qiriazi was also the head of one of the first national societies within Albania, named “The Evangelical Brotherhood”. As a result, Gjerasim Qiriazi is considered as the father of the Albanian Protestant Church.&lt;ref name="Kisha Protestante"&gt;{{cite web

'''Ragtime''' or RAGTIME is the code name of four secret surveillance programs conducted by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) of the United States. These programs date back to at least 2002&lt;ref name=wapo1&gt;[https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/nsa-report-on-privacy-violations-in-the-first-quarter-of-2012/395/ NSA report on privacy violations in the first quarter of 2012], The Washington Post, August 16, 2013, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and were revealed in March 2013 in the book ''Deep State: Inside the Government Secrecy Industry'', by [[Marc Ambinder]] and D.B. Grady.

These special programs are conducted under the code name RAGTIME (also abbreviated as RT), and are divided into several subcomponents. It's said that about fifty companies have provided data to this domestic collection program.

RAGTIME consists of four parts: RAGTIME-A, RAGTIME-B, RAGTIME-C, and RAGTIME-P.&lt;ref&gt;Shane Harris, [http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/dead_drop/surveillance-state/ragtime-codename-of-nsas-secret-domestic-intelligence-program-revealed-in-new-book.php Ragtime: Code name of NSA’s Secret Domestic Intelligence Program Revealed in New Book], February 27, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the book ''Deep State'', only about three dozen NSA officials have access to RAGTIME's intercept data on domestic counter-terrorism collection, though outside the agency some 1000 people have knowledge of the program's details. Internally, the NSA has a compliance staff of about four or five people to ensure the program stays within laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/02/28/deep_state_book_uncovers_details_on_ragtime_domestic_surveillance_program.html Details Revealed on Secret U.S. “Ragtime” Domestic Surveillance Program], February 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under the RAGTIME-P program, the [[FISA court]] and the US Attorney General both certify a slate of approved targets, which include bulk data, like phone call logs and records that can be collected around those targets. Apparently, RAGTIME-P can process as many as 50 different data sets at one time. 

All intercepted data go to the NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, where a program called [[XKeyscore]] processes them and sending them to different so-called "production lines" that deal with targets, like counterterrorism or specific countries. These processed data are stored in different NSA databases like [[Pinwale|PINWALE]] for internet content and [[MARINA]] for internet metadata, which is generally stored for five years. 

Originally, RAGTIME only applied to NSA Establishment FISA data, but in 2002 this was changed and since then the program encompasses both NSA Establishment FISA and FBI FISA data.&lt;ref name=wapo1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marc Ambinder, RAGTIME refers to phonecall and e-mail content intercepted under FISA authority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/marcambinder/statuses/368228547103453185 Twitter message] from August 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''State Police of Latvia''' (also '''Latvian State Police''', {{lang-lv|Latvijas Valsts policija}}) is the national [[law enforcement agency]] of [[Latvia]]. It is subordinate to the [[List of Ministers of the Interior of Latvia|Ministry of the Interior]]. The agency is divided into five Regional Administrations ([[Riga]], [[Courland|Kurzeme]], [[Latgale]], [[Vidzeme]], [[Zemgale]]), which are responsible for policing priorities and the availability of public security police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vp.gov.lv/?id=71&amp;said=71&amp;rsd=1|title=About us  &gt; The State Police of Latvia|last=|first=|date=|website=www.vp.gov.lv|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The founding date of the Latvian Police is considered to be 5 December 1918, when the transitional government of the newly-proclaimed Republic of Latvia, the [[People's Council of Latvia]], approved the Temporary Regulations on the Internal Security Organization ([[Latvian language|Latvian]]: ''Pagaidu noteikumi par iekšējās apsardzības organizēšanu''), which regulated the structure of the police force and put it under jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Latvia)|Ministry of the Interior of Latvia]], led by [[Miķelis Valters]]. The date is now commemorated in Latvia as the Day of the Police. The regulations ordered the formation of 23 police districts - one for each district of Latvia and 6 prefectures of the largest cities (Riga, [[Liepāja]], [[Daugavpils]], [[Jelgava]], [[Rēzekne]], [[Ventspils]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Latvijas policijas vēsture, 2. sējums; 7. sējums|last=Žīgure|first=Anna|publisher=Fakts|year=1998|isbn=9789984925103|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the ongoing [[Latvian War of Independence]] and the lack of territory controlled by Latvian forces at that time, the force could only begin its activities in the summer of 1919 after the [[Latvian National Armed Forces|Latvian Army]] and its allies had liberated large parts of the country from the [[Red Army]]. Facing a lack of qualified personnel, the Police School at the Riga Prefecture was opened in the same year. 

After the war, the force was further divided into the Civil (''Kārtības policija''), Criminal (''Kriminālpolicija'') and Secret Police (Political Police, ''Politiskā policija''). The Latvian Criminal Police became a member of [[Interpol]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iem.gov.lv/eng/ministry/history/|title=History - Ministry of the Interior|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iem.gov.lv|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|Soviet occupation of Latvia]] in 1940, the police force was dissolved and former servicemen persecuted under the Soviet regime. Law enforcement in the [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian SSR]] was primarily the task of the Soviet [[militsiya]].

After the [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|restoration of the independence of Latvia]], the Latvian Police was re-established in 1991, with one of the first units being the 1st Police (Patrol) Battalion on 30 April 1991. The main task of the battalion, which was the first armed formations of the Latvian government, was to provide security of the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia|Supreme Council of Latvia]] and strategically important buildings (government offices, [[Latvijas Radio|radio]] and [[Latvian Television|television]]). In 1992, the battalion was renamed as the [[Latvian Security Service of Parliament and State President|Security Service of the Republic of Latvia]], which was merged into the [[Latvian Military Police|Military Police]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bataljons.lv/index.php/vesture.html|title=1.

'''Yalla''' ([[Cyrillic]]: ''Ялла;'' pronounced {{IPA-uz|jælˈlæ|}} in Uzbek) is a [[folk rock]] band from [[Uzbekistan]]. They appeared in 1970 and in the 1970s-1980s, were popular all over the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] countries. The most prominent song of Yalla was ''[[Uchquduq]] - three water wells'', and it was once the most popular hit in [[USSR]] in 1980s. They sing in [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and occasionally some other languages, such as Arabic, [[German language|German]] and [[Tatar]].

The leader of the band is [[Farrukh Zokirov]].
The members of Yalla are graduates of the [[Ostrovsky Theatrical Art Institute]] and the Ashrafi State Conservatory in Tashkent. They are not Russian but Uzbek, a Turkic nationality from the crossroads of the ancient Silk Road. Their music incorporates traditional ethnic folk tunes and poetry of Uzbekistan and other Central Asian and Middle Eastern cultures, along with contemporary pop and dance influences, into a unique international blend. They perform songs in more than 10 languages, including Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], Hindi, Nepalese and French as well as Uzbek and Russian.

Formed in the early 1970s, Yalla has appeared on Soviet national television as well as performing in Moscow and elsewhere in the Soviet Union, and on concert tours in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America, including featured appearances at the "Voice of Asia" festival.
The Yalla band had some changes at the time of collapse of the Soviet Union. The Immigration of Rustam Ilyasov (musical arranger and bass guitar) to the United States and independence of Uzbekistan made Yalla change their songs more local.
Some new hits came out, such as ''Uzbekistan'', ''Bez lubimyh glaz'' and some more.
Yalla invited a dancer Roza Abdulhairiva to make a dance show mixed with singing.
Yalla has invited Tolkin Isakov who was a percussion teacher at the Tashkent State Conservatory. He replaced Rustam Ilyasov. Percussionist Ibragim Aliev was an addition to Yalla with a skillful performance on Uzbek national percussion instruments.
It was another pick of Yalla for few years (1994–1999).
