He then used a Knife to slice the bag, nunchucks to break the board, and a [[Katana]] to slice the pineapple in half – all with deadly precision of course.{{Citation needed |date=September 2014}}

The suspense and the intrigue and the mystery, it was absolutely terrifyingly brilliant."{{Citation needed |date=September 2014}}

==History==
Al-Manar first began terrestrial broadcasting from Beirut, Lebanon on 4 June 1991.&lt;ref name="Harb2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zahera Harb|title=Channels of Resistance in Lebanon: Liberation Propaganda, Hezbollah and the Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p7FOdul0mbkC&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=22 October 2012|date=15 April 2011|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84885-120-7|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the station began broadcasting via satellite at a cost that was a couple of million dollars.&lt;ref name="Inside Hizballahs Al-Manar"&gt;{{harvp|Jorisch|2004|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2012}} The station was located in the predominantly [[Shi'a]] neighborhood of [[Haret Hreik]] in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where the Hezbollah is also headquartered.&lt;ref name="Inside Hizballahs Al-Manar"/&gt; Originally, the station employed only a few men that had studied media in [[London]] during the mid-1980s. But almost a year later, Al-Manar was employing over 150 people.&lt;ref name="Inside Hizballahs Al-Manar"/&gt;

Initially, Al Manar would broadcast only five hours per day. Shortly before the 1992 election, it began broadcasting regular news bulletins in order to help Hezbollah attain more votes and spread its message to more people. In 1993, the station expanded its broadcasting to seven hours a day and extended its signal to the southern part of the [[Bekaa Valley]]. Ahead of the [[Lebanese general election, 1996|1996 Lebanese parliamentary elections]], additional [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] were erected in [[North Governorate|Northern Lebanon]] and throughout the [[Mount Lebanon]] range, so that the station could be viewed not only in Lebanon, but also in western [[Syria]] and northern Israel. Broadcasting was extended to 20 hours in 1998 but reduced to 18 hours in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jorisch|2004|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the Lebanese government granted broadcasting licenses to only five television stations, not including Al-Manar. Approximately 50 stations were forced to close at the time. Several stations appealed the government's decision, but only four of them were finally granted licenses, one of which was Al-Manar. On 18 September, the Lebanese Cabinet decided to grant Al-Manar a license after having been requested to do so by then Syrian [[President of Syria|president]] [[Hafiz al-Asad]]. Al-Manar received the license in July 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jorisch|2004|pp=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the US department of treasury, Al Manar is the media arm of the Hezbollah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/js4134.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621044829/http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/js4134.htm |date=21 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The station manager Muhammad Afif Ahmad, said that Al Manar belongs to Hezbollah culturally and politically.&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post'', 19 June 1995, Al-Manar: Hizbullah TV, 24/7, Avi Jorisch, ''Middle East Quarterly'' Winter 2004, pp. 17–31&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, Al Manar was estimated to hold 10-15 million viewers daily worldwide.&lt;ref name="partyofgod"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffreygoldberg.net/articles/tny/a_reporter_at_large_in_the_par.php |title=A Reporter At Large: In The Party Of God (Part I) |author=[[Jeffrey Goldberg]] |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=14 October 2002 |accessdate=31 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gbBkEx6J?url=http://www.jeffreygoldberg.net/articles/tny/a_reporter_at_large_in_the_par.php |archivedate=7 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite broadcasting===
During the 1990s, the popularity of [[satellite broadcasting]] greatly increased in the [[Arab world]] and in Lebanon. The first Lebanese station to use this technology was [[Future Television]], launching Future International SAT in 1994, while [[LBCI]] and the Lebanese government followed by launching LBCSAT and [[Tele-Liban|Tele Liban Satellite]] respectively. In order to compete with these emerging stations, and in order to find an international audience, Al-Manar announced its intention to launch a satellite channel on 9 March 2000. [[Muhammad Ra'd]], a Hezbollah member of parliament and al-Manar's largest shareholder, submitted the request to the minister of transmission, which was approved in April 2000. Although the launch of the satellite station was originally planned for July, the date was moved up in order to coincide with the end of the [[1982-2000 South Lebanon conflict|Israeli occupation of South Lebanon]] on 25 May. This success led other television stations to follow in launching satellite stations, including [[Murr TV]] in November 2000, but it was shut down for "violating an election law prohibiting [[propaganda]]" — a fate which al-Manar did not meet, although its programming was also considered propaganda by many analysts{{Who|date=December 2009}} {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. [[ArabSat]], a leading communications satellite operator in the [[Middle East]], headquartered in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], was at first wary about collaborating with al-Manar, because of the station's Shi'a agenda{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  — the two companies agreed, however, that the programming would be adapted to the pan-Arab audience, leading to a slight difference between the local broadcast and the one via satellite. At first, only three hours of satellite programming were broadcast per day, but by December 2000, the station was broadcasting around the clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jorisch|2004|pp=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Manar was soon carried by many satellite providers. However, starting with the removal of the station from [[TARBS World TV]] in [[Australia]] in 2003, many satellite television providers stopped featuring it. Until then the station was featured by the following providers at one time or another:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
*[[Intelsat]], broadcasting to [[North America]]
*[[New Skies Satellites]] NSS-803, [[Africa]] and parts of [[Europe]]

*[[AsiaSat]], [[Asia]]

*[[Eutelsat]], Europe, North Africa, and Middle East

{{div col end}}

According to the [[BBC]] on 26 July 2006, Al-Manar had three satellite signals:&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, July 26, 2006 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5217484.stm Israel steps up "psy-ops" in Lebanon] Retrieved 1 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Manar during 2006 Lebanon War===

====Israeli Air Force strike====
The channel was continuously struck by missiles during Israeli air raids. The [[Israeli Air Force]] attacks on 13 July 2006 led to injury of three employees.&lt;ref name=mreport&gt;{{cite web|title=Media in Lebanon: Reporting on a Nation Divided |url=http://www.freemedia.at/fileadmin/media/Documents/IPI_mission_reports/Lebanon_Mission_Report.pdf |publisher=IPI |accessdate=16 July 2012 |format=Mission Report |date=December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919231441/http://www.freemedia.at/fileadmin/media/Documents/IPI_mission_reports/Lebanon_Mission_Report.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack on Al Manar's facilities shortly followed another strike against the [[Rafic Hariri International Airport]] in Beirut earlier that morning. Despite the attack, the station remained on air, broadcasting from undisclosed locations.

The [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] bombed Al-Manar's Beirut complex again on July 16 causing fire in the complex and surrounding buildings. The station's signal disappeared briefly several times, then continued normal programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newssafety.com/hotspots/countries/lebanon/alertnet/lebanon160706.htm|title=Hizbollah rockets hit Haifa, Israel strikes Lebanon|accessdate=27 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005103/http://www.newssafety.com/hotspots/countries/lebanon/alertnet/lebanon160706.htm|archive-date=27 September 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Illegality of bombing=====
The bombing of media outlets violates [[international law]] when they are not being used for [[military]] purposes ("it is unlawful to attack facilities that merely shape [[civilian]] opinion; neither directly contributes to military operations"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/07/17/lebano13748.htm|title=Can Israel attack Hezbollah radio and television stations? |accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Human Rights Watch]].

This incident has been condemned by the [[International Federation of Journalists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifj.org/default.asp?Index=4064&amp;Language=EN''The|title=International Federation of Journalists condemned bombing of Al-Manar''|accessdate=March 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Israel Association of Journalists]] withdrew from the federation due to this criticism, claiming that Al-Manar employees "are not journalists, they are terrorists".&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Post, 16 July 2006, [https://archive.is/20120708224352/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150886017691&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Israel threatens to leave World Press Federation] Note that this article refers to the "World Press Federation" in an apparent error&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Post, 20 July 2006, [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1153291961355 Israeli journalists pull out of IFJ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511113811/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1153291961355&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=11 May 2011 }} Retrieved 27 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York City|New York]] based [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], has also expressed alarm over the incident as "it (Al-Manar) does not appear based on a monitoring of its broadcasts today to be serving any discernible military function, according to CPJ’s analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.org/news/2006/mideast/lebanon13july06na.html''Lebanon:|title=Israeli forces strike Al-Manar TV facilities''|accessdate=27 March 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=December 2009}}
Al-Manar's programming consists of 25% [[music video]]s and [[Filler (media)|fillers]], 25% series and [[drama]]s, 25% [[talk show]]s, and finally 25% news and family shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jorisch|2004|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the programming is self-produced, although on occasion, programming from [[IRIB]] (Iran) is used. The [[Perspective (cognitive)|point-of-view]] of the programming is strongly [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Israel]] and [[Anti-Americanism|anti-US]]. "Appearing on al-Manar, Hezbollah Secretary General [[Hassan Nasrallah]] frequently calls for `[[Death to America]]`" and the [[Statue of Liberty]] is depicted "as a [[ghoul]], her gown dripping blood, a knife instead of a torch in her raised hand."&lt;ref&gt;Avi Jorisch, ''[[National Review]]'', 22 December 2004, [http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/jorisch200412220812.asp Terrorist Television Hezbollah has a worldwide reach.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programs===
The news programming includes much footage from the international press, especially the Israeli. Additionally the station subscribes to the following [[wire service]]s: [[Reuters]], [[Associated Press]], [[Agence France Presse]], and [[Deutsche Presse Agentur]]. It also sources stories from Iranian news agencies such as FARS and IRNA. The station airs eight news bulletins a day in [[Arabic]] in addition to one in [[English language|English]] and one in [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jorisch|2004|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several talk shows are regularly aired on al-Manar. The best known of these is ''Beit al-ankabut'' (''The Spider's House''); its title alludes to a [[metaphor]], Hassan Nasrallah often employs to describe Israel. It is dedicated to uncovering the "weakness of the Zionist entity", i.e. Israel. It attempts to convince the Arab world that Israel could easily be destroyed, for example, by an increase in the Arab population and the implementation of the Palestinian [[right of return]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jorisch|2004|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further talk shows include ''Hadith al-sa'a'' (''Talk of the Hour''), ''Matha ba'ad'' (''What's Next?''), ''Ma'al Hadath'' (''With The Event''), ''Bayna Kawsayn'' (''Between The Brackets''), ''Milafat'' (''Files''), ''Al-din wa al-hayat'' (''Religion and Life''), and ''Nun wa al-qalam'' (''The 'Nun' and the Pen''). Guests include well-known journalists, analysts, writers, Lebanese politicians, spokespersons of terrorist groups, and Islamic scholars, who then discuss current religious, political, and cultural, regional and global topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jorisch|2004|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Manar often airs music videos and fillers in between full-length programs and during commercial breaks. The music videos are generally dedicated to the following seven purposes: the promotion of the Hezbollah, highlighting the importance of armed resistance against Israel, the glorification of [[martyrdom]], spreading of [[anti-Americanism]], denunciation of Israel and Zionism as the embodiments of terrorism, the appeals for the destruction of Israel, and the depiction of the future of Arab youths.&lt;ref name="i104"/&gt; The videos are on average three minutes long. The videos are usually professionally produced by the station itself and each usually takes about three to four days to make.&lt;ref name="i104"&gt;{{harvp|Jorisch|2004|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filler material usually consists of appeals to donate money to the Hezbollah, lists of [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] taking place worldwide, and slogans in English, [[Hebrew]], or Arabic.&lt;ref name="Jorish_105"&gt;{{harvp|Jorisch|2004|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station also offers [[Broadcasting of sports events|sports]] broadcasting - such as the programs ''Goal'' and ''Tis'in daqiqa'' (''Ninety Minutes'') -, family programming - such as ''Al-mustakshifoun al-judud'' (''The New Explorers''), ''Al-Muslimoun fi al-Sin'' (''Muslims in China''), and ''Ayday al-khayr'' (''Hands of Benevolence'') -, game shows - including ''Al-mushahid shahid'' (''The Viewer Is the Witness''), where contestants attempt to guess the names of Israeli political and military figures, and ''Al-muhima'' (''The Mission'') -, and even a children's program called ''Al-manr al-saghir'' (''The Little Manar''), which is in the style of the US show ''[[Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', targeting three- to seven-year-olds.&lt;ref name="Jorish_105"/&gt; Al-Manar also broadcasts [[Iran]]ian [[soap opera]]s, [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into [[Modern Standard Arabic]].

During [[Ramadan]], al-Manar features special programs, many of which are self-produced. In 2001, ''Izz al-Din al-Qassam: Qisat al-jihad wa al-muqawama'' (''Izz al-Din al-Qassam: A Story of Jihad and Resistance''), a four-part drama based on the life of [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam|Izz al-Din al-Qassam]], an early-twentieth-century Arab, after whom the [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]] are named. It was considered a success among Palestinians. The 2002 program ''Faris bi la jawad'' (''A Knight without a Horse''), which was produced by an [[Egypt]]ian, was based on ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', an old [[Russia]]n [[anti-Semitic]] text claiming a conspiracy of [[Jews]] control the world, like many programs of the station. The 29-part series ''[[Ash-Shatat]]'' (''The Diaspora''), which was aired in 2003, was also based on ''The Protocols'' and produced in [[Syria]]; it led to the banning of al-Manar in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jorisch|2004|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies: [http://www.intelligence.org.il/Eng/sib/10_04/oct_04.htm#4 Legal proceedings to ban Al-Manar in France and Lebanon’s rushing to Hezbollah’s aid]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Al-Manar was the first TV station to report Hezbollah's condemnation of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Other non-state attacks against the United States have also been condemned on Al Manar, including the 2000 [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]] suicide attack against a US Navy destroyer.&lt;ref name=lamb /&gt;

Al-Manar was once described as one of the channels, among other complex reasons, of the spread of [[Shia|Shiism]] in Syria in the years before 2009.&lt;ref name=ctiii09&gt;{{harvp|Sindawi|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the Israeli withdrawal from [[South Lebanon]], al-Manar's programming political focus was mainly against the Israeli presence in Lebanon. While the withdrawal in May 2000 left a void in the station's programming, Hezbollah and al-Manar consider the [[Shebaa Farms]] to be Lebanese territory occupied by Israel, and this became a focal point for political programming. In September of that year, the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]] broke out, and al-Manar began to cover the issue of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] more extensively, overtly propagandizing to support the Palestinian militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jorisch|2004|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journalistic standards and neutrality==
According to Al Manar's news director, Hassan Fadlallah, Al Manar does not aim to be neutral in its broadcasting, "Neutrality like that of Al Jazeera is out of the question for us," Fadlallah said. "We cover only the victim, not the aggressor. [[CNN]] is the Zionist news network, Al Jazeera is neutral, and Al Manar takes the side of the Palestinians...He said Al Manar's opposition to neutrality means that, unlike Al Jazeera, his station would never feature interviews or comments by Israeli officials. "We're not looking to interview Sharon," Fadlallah said. "We want to get close to him in order to kill him."&lt;ref name="partyofgod"/&gt;

===Accusations and restrictions===

====Designation as a 'terrorist entity'====
Al-Manar was placed on a US terrorist watchlist in December 2004.&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://counterpunch.org/lamb01012010.html |title=The Israel Lobby's War on Al Manar TV: How a Lebanese Television Station Got Included on the T-List |author=Franklin Lamb |work=[[CounterPunch]] |date=1–3 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104222053/http://www.counterpunch.org/lamb01012010.html |archivedate=4 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reporters without Borders]] said that no evidence was presented of Al-Manar's involvement with terrorism.&lt;ref name=lamb/&gt; The main evidence provided for Al-Manar being anti-semitic was its partial showing, in October–November 2003, of the Syrian-produced 29-part series ''[[Ash-Shatat]]'' ("The Diaspora"). "Al Manar management apologized for airing the series, dropped it and explained that the Station had purchased it without first viewing the entire series."&lt;ref name=lamb/&gt; Lebanon's [[ambassador]] to the United States, [[Farid Abboud]], protested: "If you want simply to demonize or eliminate one side, you're not going to advance the issue. If you are going to focus on one side simply because of the political message, it's unacceptable and it's a grave breach of the [[freedom of speech]].".&lt;ref name="2ij3d"/&gt;

In March 2006 Al-Manar was designated as a "[[Specially Designated Global Terrorist]] entity" by the United States, declaring it "owned or controlled by the Iran-funded [[Hezbollah]] terrorist network".&lt;ref name="js4134"&gt;{{cite web| year=2006| publisher=[[U.S. Department of the Treasury]]| author=U.S. Department of the Treasury| url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/js4134.aspx| title=U.S. Designates Al-Manar as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Entity}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Al-Manar was made subject to US sanctions.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="js4134"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/terror/terror.pdf |title=U.S. Treasury List of Organizations sanctioned under Executive Order 13224 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910021822/http://www.treasury.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/terror/terror.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allegations of anti-Semitic programming====
One of the satellite providers which has transmitted Al-Manar is the French satellite Hot Bird 4, owned by the [[Eutelsat]] Satellite organisation. On 13 December 2004, the French [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]], the highest administrative Court in France, ordered the French-based Eutelsat Company to shut down Al-Manar broadcasts following accusations that its programmes were [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] and could incite hatred.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurispd/index_ac_ld0460.shtml full text of the decision] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217003233/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurispd/index_ac_ld0460.shtml |date=17 December 2004 }}, [http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/actual/index_ac_lc0418.shtml press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217003337/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/actual/index_ac_lc0418.shtml |date=17 December 2004 }}, in [[French language|French]]; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4093579.stm BBC report])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EU, Brussels, 17 March 2005 [http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/05/98&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=1&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en EU Rules and Principles on Hate Broadcasts: Frequently Asked Questions] Retrieved 26 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Manar claims the French decision was political and not legal, influenced by Israel and Jewish lobbies.&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera, 27 December 2004 [http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/A2751281-EEC6-4B8E-B36A-D9996FCA6B7D.htm US designates Al-Manar TV 'terrorist'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818062418/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/A2751281-EEC6-4B8E-B36A-D9996FCA6B7D.htm |date=18 August 2006 }} Retrieved 1 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Banning of broadcasts====
{{Wikinews|Man arrested for broadcasting Hezbollah television in New York}}
Al-Manar's broadcasts have been banned by the US, [[France]],&lt;ref name="france_ban"/&gt; [[Spain]],&lt;ref name="comm_EC"/&gt; and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Germany_ban"/&gt;

After the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] placed Al-Manar on the [[Terrorist Exclusion List]] on 17 December 2004, transmissions to North America via [[Intelsat]]'s satellites were blocked.&lt;ref name="2ij3d"&gt;Reuters, 18 December 2004 [https://web.archive.org/web/20050326161910/http://in.news.yahoo.com/041218/137/2ij3d.html U.S. designates Al-Manar TV as 'terrorist'] Retrieved 1 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Times,'' 19 December 2004 [http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20041218-104540-1727r.htm Hezbollah's TV loses U.S. feed] Retrieved 1 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Javed Iqbal, a resident of [[New York City]] is the first person to charged under this law. Iqbal, 45, a Pakistani who had been living in the U.S. for more than 25 years, was charged by federal prosecutors with [[providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization]] by broadcasting Al Manar to U.S. customers, in exchange for thousands of dollars payment. In a 2008 plea bargain, he agreed to serve a prison term of up to {{frac|6|1|2}} years.

The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Media Authority "discovered that a satellite owned by [[New Skies Satellites]] was carrying Al-Manar and has ordered the company to stop doing so, because the channel did not have the required Dutch licence."&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera, 17 March 2005 [https://archive.is/20070313000842/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/504FEF70-AB80-4B8A-86E9-A689EC67A84E.htm Al-Manar TV to go off Dutch platform] Retrieved 30 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'', 18 March 2005 [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=553690 EU blocks Hezbollah TV broadcasts in Europe] Retrieved 30 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Many, including [[Radio Netherlands]] Worldwide Media Network&lt;ref name="Netherlands1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Netherlands2"/&gt; consider this to be a ban. The Spanish authorities banned the retransmission of Al-Manar by [[Hispasat]] on 30 June 2005 (which effectively prevents its reception not only in the Iberian Peninsula but also in South America).&lt;ref name="comm_EC"/&gt;

The lack of transmission from Intelsat had the effect of making Al-Manar unavailable in [[Canada]], which some have interpreted as a "ban".&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; While Al-Manar is not approved for distribution in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/satlist.htm|title=Revised lists of eligible satellite services|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=3 August 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060715182853/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/satlist.htm| archivedate= 15 July 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no record of application for approval having been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[TARBS World TV]] voluntarily stopped broadcasting al-Manar in [[Australia]] on 5 November 2003, 15 days into an investigation by the ABA regarding accusations of "broadcast programs that are likely to incite or perpetuate hatred against or gratuitously vilify any person or group on the basis of their [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[religion]]". The report for this investigation was never finalised as TARBS had gone into receivership by that time. Al-Manar in August 2009 received approval for broadcast by Australian Communications and Media Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galusaustralis.com/2009/08/acma-says-ok-to-hezbollah-but-%E2%80%98no-way%E2%80%99-to-lezbollah/ |title=ACMA says ‘OK’ to Hezbollah, but ‘No Way’ to Lezbollah |publisher=Galus Australis |date=24 August 2009|accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Manar provides a live feed of its programming on the [[Internet]] through its [http://www.almanar.com.lb/english/main.php website]. This effectively circumvents the bans as Al-Manar is still available in all the areas it does not broadcast to via satellite.

===Google and Apple applications===
On 25 July 2012, Al Manar launched an application through [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iTunes]] [[App Store (iOS)|app store]], directing users to various content produced by the Hezbollah television station, including speeches by Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accessadl.blogspot.com/2012/07/hezbollah-on-your-iphone-theres-app-for.html |title=Hezbollah on Your iPhone: There’s An App for That|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the application was subsequently pulled from iTunes four days later, and two days after that, Google announced that the al-Manar app had been removed from Google Play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-tv-app-banned-by-apple-and-google/ Hezbollah TV app banned by Apple and Google] by Gabe Fisher, ''Times of Israel'', 1 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maha Abouelenein]], Head of Communications for the Mena at Google, subsequently stated that “We remove applications that violate our policies, such as apps that are illegal or that promote hate speech” although she added that “We don’t comment on individual applications — however, you can check out our policies for more."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/business/technology/google-and-apple-ban-web-application-for-hezbollah-tv-station-1.1059565 Google and Apple ban web application for Hezbollah TV station] Jumana Al Tamimi, Gulf News, 8 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Manar TV subsequently blamed "Israeli incitement against Al Manar TV" as the reason Al-Manar mobile apps were removed by Apple and Google. An Al-Manar TV reporter stated that: "Al Manar TV is once again targeted by America and Israel. The removal of the channel's mobile apps from the Google and Apple stores is a new attempt to curb Al-Manar's message of resistance.&lt;ref name=MEMRIAl/&gt;

Al Manar TV Director-General Abdallah Qasir stated that the removal of the apps "indicates that Al Manar TV has the ability to cause great harm to Israel, and that Israel is extremely annoyed by Al Manar becoming so widespread and by its great credibility. Israel cannot even bear to see the Al-Manar icon on smartphones." Abd Al-Hadi Mahfouz, president of the Lebanese National Media Council, also supported Al-Manar, arguing that: "This move contradicts all laws pertaining to radio and television, to the exercising of media liberties, and to the right of citizens, Western and Arab alike, to information." Rabi' Al-Ba'lbaki, the head of the Lebanese IT Association reportedly called for a boycott of Apple and Google if they do not restore service for Al-Manar's applications.&lt;ref name=MEMRIAl&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/3517.htm Hizbullah's Al-Manar TV after Google and Apple Banned Its Apps: We Will Find Other Ways to Deliver "Message of Resistance"], MEMRITV, Clip No. 3517 (transcript), 2 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement issued on 16 August 2012, Al Manar says it is “back on Ipad and Iphone applications via alternative ways, following the campaign carried out by the Jewish Anti-Defamation League to deactivate Al-Manar applications on smart phones at Google Play and apple store.”&lt;ref name=adef&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.adl.org/extremism/hezbollah-itunes-googleapps-blame-adl-for|title=Hezbollah Re-Launches Apps; Blames ADL For Failure Of Previous Effort|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|date=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to avoid distributor policies and control, the new applications are downloadable directly from Al-Manar’s website, which is hosted British server.&lt;ref name=adef/&gt; The website also provides instructions, along with screen shots, on configuring Android phones to accept applications “not sourced in Android Market” and for installing the application on iPhones.&lt;ref name=adef/&gt;

In March 2014, Al Manar relaunched their application in Apple's iTunes store under the name "LCG."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jns.org/news-briefs/2014/3/14/hezbollahs-al-manar-news-launches-app-in-apples-itunes-store#.UyNzIvldXsI Hezbollah’s Al-Manar news station launches app in Apple’s iTunes store] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315011331/http://www.jns.org/news-briefs/2014/3/14/hezbollahs-al-manar-news-launches-app-in-apples-itunes-store#.UyNzIvldXsI |date=15 March 2014 }} JNS.org, JNS.org, 14 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An American Tail: Fievel's Gold Rush''''' is a [[platform game]] that was first released in Europe on March 1, 2002 for the [[Game Boy Advance]], then in North America on May 2, 2003. It was developed by [[Hokus-Pokus]]&lt;ref name="mobygames"&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/an-american-tail-fievels-gold-rush ''An American Tail: Fievel's Gold Rush''] at [[MobyGames]]&lt;/ref&gt; and published by [[Conspiracy Entertainment]].

==Gameplay==
Fievel Mousekewitz, a rodent with an immigration card, is heading west in ''An American Tail: Fievel's Gold Rush''. Based on the animated series from [[Universal Studios]], the game has players controlling Fievel as he travels through 18 levels and six worlds, including "New York City" and "Gold Dust Gulch," to piece together Cat Malone's treasure map. Fievel will swing on rope, attack with his ten-gallon hat, ride riverboats, and jump the train to find Wylie Burp's gold.&lt;ref name="ag"/&gt;

His family and friends were also kidnapped, so he has to rescue his family, as well as find the gold. The game is a traditional side-scrolling platformer. Conspiracy Entertainment has the game aimed at a "young audience who loved the films and direct-to-video sequels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/137/137178p1.html|title=An American Tail: Fievel's Gold Rush|publisher=IGN|date=2001-10-18|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The game received mediocre reviews from critics. jeuxvideo.com stated, in French, that "It takes a real pleasure to play in an environment so worked. The levels are quite varied and different to want to continue. The characters are very fine and loyal to the cartoon. The animation is very fluid. You will never be hampered by a slowdown and this regardless of the number of enemies displayed[...] particular attention was brought to the soundtrack. It is really very good quality and quite adapted to crossed levels. But there also are somewhat regretted the lack of diversity in the music". Though the publication pointed out that the game will only appeal to younger players, and of the short length of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=fr&amp;to=en&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jeuxvideo.com%2Farticles%2F0000%2F00002040_test.htm|title=Fievel and the lost treasure|publisher=jeuxvideo.com|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of animation in the United States}}

Television animation developed from the success of animated movies in the first half of the 20th century. The state of animation changed dramatically in the three decades starting with the post-[[World War II]] proliferation of television. While studios gave up on the big-budget theatrical short cartoons that thrived in the 1930s and 1940s, new television animation studios would thrive based on the economy and volume of their output. By the end of the 1970s and 1980s, most of the Golden Age animators had retired or died, and their younger successors were ready to change the industry and the way that animation was perceived.

== From the big screen to the small screen ==
Cartoons in the Golden Age, such as ''[[Red Hot Riding Hood]]'', contained topical and often suggestive humor, though they were seen primarily as "children's entertainment" by movie exhibitors. This point of view prevailed when the new medium of [[television]] began showing cartoons in the late 1950s.

One of the first images to be broadcast over television was that of [[Felix the Cat]]. In 1938, cartoonist Chad Grothkopf's eight-minute experimental ''Willie the Worm'', cited as the first animated film created for TV, was shown on NBC.&lt;ref&gt;Connecticut Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjW6cCE4v1QC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22chad+grothkopf%22+worm&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chad%20grothkopf%22%20worm&amp;f=false |author=Beckerman, Howard|title=''Animation: The Whole Story''|publisher=Allworth|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As TV became a phenomenon and began to draw audiences away from movie theaters, many children's TV shows included airings of theatrical cartoons in their schedules, and this introduced a new generation of children to the cartoons of the 1920s and 1930s. Cartoon producer Paul Terry sold the rights to the [[Terrytoons]] cartoon library to television and retired from the business in the early 1950s. This guaranteed a long life for the characters of [[Mighty Mouse]] and [[Heckle and Jeckle]], whose cartoons were syndicated and rerun in children's television programming blocks for the next 30 to 40 years.

There were a number of early experiments in limited animation television cartoons. These cartoons usually were about five minutes in length and were episodic in nature, allowing stations to flexibly program them. One of the first cartoons produced expressly for television was ''[[Crusader Rabbit]]'', a creation of Alexander Anderson and [[Jay Ward]]. A small studio in Florida was responsible for another early adventure serial, ''[[Colonel Bleep]]''. Often, existing programs would be a launching ground for new cartoon characters. In 1956, the ''[[Howdy Doody]]'' show aired the first ''[[Gumby]]'' [[clay animation|clay animated]] cartoon from creator [[Art Clokey]]. [[Sam Singer]] earned a certain degree of infamy for his efforts at television animation, which included an animated adaptation of ''[[The Adventures of Paddy the Pelican]]'' (which may or may not have made it to air) and the original series ''[[Bucky and Pepito]]'', both of which have been cited as among the [[List of television series considered the worst|worst of their kind]].  On the other hand, a long-running series of animated shorts named ''[[Tom Terrific]]'' was produced by Terrytoons for the ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' show, and this series was praised by film historian Leonard Maltin as "one of the finest cartoons ever produced for television." &lt;ref&gt;Maltin, L. (1987). ''Of mice and magic: A history of American animated cartoons'' (Rev. ed.). New York: New American Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1954, [[Walt Disney]] capitalized on the medium of television with his own weekly TV series, ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Disneyland]].'' This ABC show popularized his new [[Disneyland]] [[theme park]] and began a decades-long series of TV broadcasts of Disney cartoons, which later expanded into the show ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color.'' While Disney recognized that the economics of the medium could not support his production standards and refused to go into TV animation, he still ordered the creation of one character exclusive to TV, [[Ludwig Von Drake]]. The character's segments would link compilations of the company's archived theatrical shorts as complete episodes. Walt continued to host the show for the rest of his life, and he became as recognizable to the TV audience as his studio's cartoon characters.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

===Hanna-Barbera===
The first major animation studio to produce cartoons exclusively for television was [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]]. When [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] closed its cartoon studio in 1957, Hanna-Barbera began producing cartoons directly for television, finding an audience in the evening "family hour" time. The first [[animated series]] from Hanna-Barbera were NBC's ''[[The Ruff &amp; Reddy Show]]'' and the [[first-run syndication]] entry ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]''. However, the studio hit its stride in 1960s with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Flintstones]]'', the first half-hour animated [[sitcom]]. Like many of its immediate successors it was originally aired during prime time when the whole family would be watching television. ''The Flintstones'' was the first of several prime-time animated series from Hanna-Barbera, which included ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Top Cat]]'', and ''[[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Jonny Quest]]''. But after the end of ''The Flintstones'' in 1966, Hanna-Barbera largely turned its efforts to the growing market for [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s, outside of isolated series for [[first run syndication]] in the 1970s such as ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]''.

Hanna-Barbera was notorious for using common [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s in its series. Its original series of the late 1950s through mid-1960s all featured anthropomorphic animals, usually an adult (who would in turn impersonate a well-known celebrity) and child, interacting with the humans of their environment.  After the immense success of ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', which premiered on [[CBS]] in 1969, the next decade of Hanna-Barbera's animated output would follow that show's formula: a group of teenagers solving mysteries or fighting crime, usually with the help of a wacky animal or a ghost. The many incarnations of ''Scooby-Doo'' ran uninterrupted on CBS and then ABC for 17 seasons. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hanna-Barbera turned to adaptations of prime time sitcoms. It was not until ''[[The Smurfs]]'' in 1981 that H-B once again had anything successful outside the ''Scooby'' template; it, in turn, led to derivative series (''[[The Snorks]]'' and ''[[Paw Paws]]''). The late 1980s and early 1990s saw Hanna-Barbera join the numerous studios producing [[younger and junior versions of cartoon characters]] for the Saturday morning cartoon market.

===Limited animation===
One of the problems with producing animation for television was the extremely labor-intensive animation process. While theatrical short subjects were previously produced in six-month cycles or longer, network television needed a season of 10-20 half hour episodes each year. This led to a number of shortcut techniques to speed up the production process, and the techniques of [[limited animation]] were applied to produce a great number of quickly-produced, low-budget TV cartoons. Hanna-Barbera also used limited animation for artistic reasons: with smaller, low-resolution screens, the company's namesakes reasoned that a limited style that focused on dialogue and close-up shots with bold outlines worked better than the fully detailed animation used in film shorts, which were designed for large theater screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[United Productions of America|UPA studio]] was one of the first victims of the TV-animation market. In 1952, because of his left-wing social activism, [[John Hubley]] was dismissed from the studio under pressure from [[Columbia Pictures]] (who was itself under pressure from the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|HUAC]]). The creative atmosphere post-Hubley was not the same and UPA's theatrical shorts ended in 1959. In order to stay afloat financially, UPA turned to television to sustain itself. The TV versions of ''Mister Magoo'' and ''Dick Tracy'' were not successful and did nothing to reverse the studio's financial decline. In spite of the 1962 animated feature ''[[Gay Purr-ee]]'' (distributed by [[Warner Bros.]]), which featured the voices of [[Judy Garland]] and [[Robert Goulet]] and a [[Harold Arlen]]/[[Yip Harburg]] song score, and the beloved animated special ''[[Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol]]'', UPA was shut down in 1964.

The [[Jay Ward Productions|Jay Ward studio]], producer of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]],'' used limited animation in its series, but compensated with its satire of [[Cold War]] politics and popular culture and its off-beat humor. Like the earlier ''Crusader Rabbit'', the Rocky and Bullwinkle adventures were multi-part serials. The Ward studio also produced ''[[George of the Jungle]]'', ''[[Super Chicken]]'', and ''[[Tom Slick]]''. It later produced a series of popular television commercials for [[The Quaker Oats Company|Quaker Oats]] cereals [[Cap'n Crunch]], [[Quisp and Quake]]. Another company that used the same animation studios as Jay Ward did was [[Total Television]], most famous for ''[[The Underdog Show]]''. Total Television and Jay Ward animated productions were often mixed and aired together in syndication, leading to the two companies' shows to sometimes be confused with each other.

[[Filmation]], headed by [[Lou Scheimer]] and Norm Prescott, was another television animation studio that arose in the 1960s. Filmation was most famous for its acquisition of licenses to produce animated series based on other media; it was one of the few companies to keep all of its animation within the United States and did not use the aesthetics of limited animation preferred by Hanna-Barbera and UPA; instead, Filmation productions relied on heavy usage of [[stock footage]], [[rotoscoping]], limited voice casts (Scheimer himself provided many voices) and a balance of licensed animated series with lower-budget, live-action ones (such as ''[[The Ghost Busters]]'' and ''[[Uncle Croc's Block]]'') to stay financially solvent. After a string of success lasting well into the 1980s, Filmation dissolved in 1989.

One of the most infamous users of limited animation was [[Cambria Studios]], which invented and patented a process known as [[Syncro-Vox]], implementing it beginning in 1960. While the process resulted in an extremely economical, quick and inexpensive product (thus making it ideal for television), it had a fatal flaw that prevented it from being taken seriously: the process involved inserting the moving lips of the voice actor over a still frame of a character's mouth. The result was that Cambria's cartoons (''[[Clutch Cargo]]'', ''[[Space Angel]]'' and ''[[Captain Fathom]]'') contained hardly any animation at all, and were effectively pictures (albeit well-drawn ones that were of greater detail than other producers') with words. Cambria switched to a more mainstream limited animation process with ''[[The New Three Stooges]]'' in 1965, but went out of business shortly afterward.

==The 1960s and 1970s==
By the late 1950s and 1960s, the perception of cartoons as children's entertainment was entrenched in the public consciousness. Animation began to disappear from movie theaters; while Disney continued to produce animated features after losing its founder, MGM and Warner Bros closed their studios, outsourced their animation, and got out of it entirely by the end of the decade. The majority of American animation came to be dominated by limited animation made for TV and aimed primarily at children. However, there were a number of attempts to challenge this perception during the late 1960s and 1970s with ambitious (and often controversial) animated projects that were definitely not for children.

===Disney===
In the 1960s, [[Walt Disney]]'s current animated films (''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', ''[[The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'', the live-action/animated combo ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', and ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'') generated hefty revenue for the studio, as did the regular reissues of earlier animated films. ''Poppins'', in particular, won five [[Academy Awards]] (and received with the studio's first [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] nomination) and topped the 1964 box office charts while launching the film career of its star, [[Julie Andrews]], who won an [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Oscar]]. ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'', now on [[NBC]], became a Sunday night television institution that kept [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Goofy]], and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] in the public consciousness long after their theatrical cartoon series had ended. The anthology series ran until 1983. In 1961, Walt helped to establish the ''[[California Institute of the Arts]].'' The founding of the institute was both a philanthropic gesture and a savvy investment by Disney, as the school provided plenty of creative talent for the company in the years to come. In 1966, the studio brought [[A.A. Milne]]'s [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] characters to the screen for the first time in two of four animated featurettes (the second of which, ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]'', won an Oscar, the last Walt Disney received).

The Disney empire was rocked to its core when Walt died from [[lung cancer]] on December 15, 1966. While the studio tried to remain true to his vision (a common [[catchphrase]] of the time was "What would Walt do?"), the level of popularity and acclaim the studio received in earlier years eluded it in the 1970s. The theme parks [[Disneyland]] and [[Walt Disney World]] (the latter having opened in 1971) ended up contributing more to the bottom line than the film division. Additionally, many veteran animators either retired or died, so the studio had to find ways to replace them. In 1973, [[Eric Larson]] started a training program for new animators.

The studio's post-Walt animation fare consisted of the features ''[[The Aristocats]]'', ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[The Rescuers]]'' and ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'', the featurettes ''[[It's Tough to Be a Bird]]'', ''[[Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!]]'', ''[[The Small One]]'', ''[[Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore]]'', and ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', and the live-action/animation hybrids ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' and ''[[Pete's Dragon]]''. Some of the films got mixed reactions from critics; ''Robin Hood'', in particular, was widely criticized for re-use of animation from earlier films (especially in the production number "The Phony King of England"), but this was done because the film had fallen way behind schedule.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hill |first=Jim |title=Why For? |work=Jim Hill Media |url= http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_hill/archive/2005/03/17/562.aspx |date=2005-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, all of these films were successful and many of them received Academy Award nominations (with two wins, one for the short ''Bird'' and another for the special effects in ''Bedknobs''). Additionally, in keeping with Walt's original intentions, the first three ''Pooh'' featurettes were compiled into the 1977 feature ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''.

The most devastating development since Walt's death occurred in September 1979, when studio animator [[Don Bluth]] led a walkout of himself and 11 of his supporters (a large chunk of the studio's animation department at the time), including [[Gary Goldman]] and [[John Pomeroy]]. Fed up with the status quo at Disney, he and his acolytes left to start his own studio, which produced the short film ''[[Banjo the Woodpile Cat]]'' and the feature film ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Beck |first=Jerry |title=Don Bluth Goes Independent |work=Animation World Magazine |date=1996-06-01 |url=http://mag.awn.com/index.php?article_no=993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney entered the 1980s facing an uncertain future, despite the respectable $39,900,000 gross and some good reviews for ''[[The Fox and the Hound (film)|The Fox and the Hound]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Fox and the Hound (1981) |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&amp;p=.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The end of Termite Terrace===
Warner Bros. shut down its animation studio completely in 1963, and the directors of [[Termite Terrace]] went their separate ways. [[Friz Freleng]] co-founded [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]], which produced ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' from 1964 to 1967. [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] reopened the studio from 1967 to 1969, but the low-budget cartoons produced were not popular with critics or audiences then or now. The new characters introduced during the Seven Arts period, such as [[Cool Cat (Looney Tunes)|Cool Cat]], [[Bunny and Claude]], [[Quick Brown Fox and Rapid Rabbit]], and [[Merlin the Magic Mouse]], never caught on, while the Termite Terrace cartoons remained perennial television favorites through syndication and Saturday morning airings throughout the remainder of the 20th century.

===Chuck Jones and MGM===
In 1961, [[Chuck Jones]] moonlighted as a writer on the UPA feature ''Gay Purr-ee''. When Warner Bros. distributed the film the following year, they discovered that he had contributed to the film in violation of his exclusive contract and fired him. Jones teamed with [[Les Goldman]] to form [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts|Sib Tower 12 Productions]] to work with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] on the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' series in the mid-1960s; his shorts were not as popular as the Hanna-Barbera originals but more so than the [[Gene Deitch]] shorts produced overseas in the early 1960s. Jones then began producing a number of successful animated TV specials. His most famous special was ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'', a 1966 [[CBS]] adaptation of the [[Dr. Seuss]] story that still remains popular and has been released on video and DVD several times. Jones also produced three animated adaptations of short stories from [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', a full-length MGM feature film entitled ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth (film)|The Phantom Tollbooth]]'', and the 1970 TV version of ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]''

===Friz Freleng===
{{Main|DePatie-Freleng Enterprises}}
After leaving the remnants of Termite Terrace behind for good, Friz Freleng and his new partner [[David H. DePatie]] went on to produce the ''[[The Pink Panther Show|Pink Panther]]'' cartoons during the 1960s and 1970s, with the cartoons appearing almost simultaneously on television and in theaters through a distribution deal with [[United Artists]]. Freleng also produced several TV specials based on [[Dr. Seuss]] books throughout the 1970s, including ''[[The Cat in the Hat (TV special)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' and ''[[The Lorax]]''.

In 1981, [[Friz Freleng]] retired. The DePatie-Freleng Enterprises studio was sold to [[Marvel Comics]], and it continued under his lead as [[Marvel Productions Ltd]]. This new studio focused almost exclusively on toy merchandising, and it found a new audience among young viewers with such action oriented cartoons as ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'' and ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]''.

===''Yellow Submarine''===
In 1968, the music of [[The Beatles]] and the [[Peter Max]]-inspired psychedelic artwork of Canadian-born animator [[George Dunning]] came together to create ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Displeased with the previous [[The Beatles (TV series)|animated television series depicting themselves]], the Beatles themselves had reservations about the project at first and declined to participate beyond providing a mix of older and original musical recordings. However, they were impressed enough with the finished film to appear in a live action epilogue.

===Ralph Bakshi===
[[File:RalphBakshiJan09.jpg|thumb|left|Ralph Bakshi tried to establish an alternative to mainstream animation through [[independent animation|independent]] and [[adult animation|adult]]-oriented productions in the 1970s.]]
In 1968, [[Ralph Bakshi]], along with producer [[Steve Krantz]], founded Bakshi Productions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=54 |chapter=First Gigs }}&lt;/ref&gt; establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators.

However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt; While browsing the East Side Book Store on [[St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)|St. Mark's Place]], Bakshi came across a copy of ''[[Robert Crumb|R. Crumb]]'s [[Fritz the Cat]]''. Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-58"/&gt;

Knopf]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-394-54684-9 |page=275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other animation===
A few attempts were made to produce independent feature-length animated films in the 1970s. Several of these were decidedly adult-oriented productions, including ''[[Watership Down (film)|Watership Down]]'', ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]],'' and a live-action/animated version of the Pink Floyd concept album ''[[Pink Floyd – The Wall|The Wall]]'' (which, although produced in Britain, received wide release in the United States).

Other films like [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]]' ''[[Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy: A Musical Adventure]]'' were less successful. The industry largely continued to ignore or dismiss animation as something only kids watched on Saturday morning television. A notable exception was a series of films based on the ''[[Peanuts]]'' franchise, beginning with the 1969 film ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]'', which was both a commercial and critical success; the films were made with the same production team behind the acclaimed ''Peanuts'' television specials that were airing throughout the time period, led by [[Bill Melendez]].

==Commercialization and counterculture==
Animation on television focused almost exclusively on children, and the tradition of getting up early to watch [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s became a weekly ritual for millions of American kids. The networks were glad to oblige their demands by providing hours-long blocks of cartoon shows. [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] became the leader in the production of TV cartoons for children. A number of other studios produced TV cartoons, such as [[Filmation]] (''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', ''[[The Archies]]'') and [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]] (''[[The Pink Panther (character)|The Pink Panther]]''), but Hanna-Barbera had developed a virtual lock on Saturday morning cartoons by the 1970s. Such critics of Hanna-Barbera's style of limited animation as Chuck Jones referred to it disparagingly as "illustrated radio," yet when one show was cancelled, the studio usually had another one ready to replace it because they were so cheap to produce.

From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, several successful prime-time animated [[TV special]]s aired. Because these one-shot cartoons were aired during prime-time hours (and thus had to appeal to adults as well as children), they had to obtain higher ratings than their Saturday and weekday counterparts. [[CBS]] in particular allowed a large number of animated TV specials to air on its network, and several of these continue to be repeated annually and sold on video and DVD.  The [[Rankin-Bass]] studio produced a number of [[stop-motion]] specials geared towards popular holidays (including ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', ''[[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)|Frosty the Snowman]]'', and ''[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (TV special)|Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town]]''); while [[Bill Melendez]]'s long-running series of ''[[Peanuts]]'' specials won numerous awards, spawned four feature films, and even launched a [[The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show|Saturday morning series]]. Other attempts to bring comic strip characters to TV did not have anywhere near as much success until one of the ''Peanuts'' directors, [[Phil Roman]], brought the [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] comic strip ''[[Garfield (comics)|Garfield]]'' to TV starting in 1982, resulting in 11 specials and a [[Garfield and Friends|long-running animated series]].

This era also saw a number of [[independent animation|independent animated]] short films that were rarely seen outside of "art house" movie theaters.  As the Hollywood animation studios faded, a number of independent producers of animation continued to make experimental, artistic animated films that explored new artistic territory in the medium of animation.  Short films such as ''The Critic,'' ''[[Bambi Meets Godzilla]],'' ''[[Lupo the Butcher]],'' and many others were almost unknown to mainstream audiences; however, these independent animated films continued to keep the yearly category of the [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film]] alive, as well as introducing a number of new names into the field of animation&amp;mdash;names that would begin to bring change to the industry in the 1980s.

===Animation in the 1980s===

====Television and toy trends====
Though the dominant [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] launched a phenomenon with the 1981 premiere of ''[[The Smurfs]]'' on NBC, very little else which they produced in this decade caught on. Adding to this was the financial problems of their owner [[Taft Broadcasting]], which was taken over by [[Carl Lindner, Jr.]], owner of [[American Financial Group|Great American Insurance Company]], in 1987. Two years later, [[Tom Ruegger]] launched an exodus of H-B employees to form a relaunched [[Warner Bros. Animation]] division. In 1991, [[Turner Broadcasting System]] bought the company and its library.

Other studios' offerings chipped away at the H-B Saturday dominance throughout the decade, such as H-B alumni [[Ruby-Spears Productions]]' ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks]]'', [[Marvel Productions|Marvel]] and [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[Muppet Babies]]'', [[DiC Entertainment|DiC]] and [[Columbia Pictures Television|Columbia]]'s ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'', and [[Film Roman]]'s ''[[Garfield and Friends]]''. Additionally, the Saturday morning continued to see attempts to adapt prime time series for animation, some successfully (''[[Happy Days]]'' and its spinoffs, ''[[Mister T (TV series)|Mister T]]'', ''[[ALF: The Animated Series]]''), others less so (''[[It's Punky Brewster (TV series)|It's Punky Brewster]]'', ''[[The Gary Coleman Show]]'', ''[[Little Rosie]]''). After three decades of resistance, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] finally entered Saturday morning in 1985 when ''[[The Gummi Bears]]'' and ''[[The Wuzzles]]'' debuted with significantly more substantial budgets; the [[first-run syndication]] success of ''[[DuckTales]]'', which premiered in 1987, eventually inspired a whole block of Disney-produced syndicated cartoons which forced competing studios to improve their own production standards to compete.

The 1980s also saw a number of cartoons based on children's toys, such as ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'', ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'', ''[[My Little Pony 'n Friends]]'', ''[[He-Man (1983)|He-Man]]'', ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]'', ''[[Jem and the Holograms]]'' and ''[[Care Bears]]''. There were even cartoons based on ''[[Pac-Man (TV series)|Pac-Man]]'' video games and ''[[Rubik, the Amazing Cube|the Rubik's Cube]]''. Some of them even inspired feature films. While many of them were successful with children, shows like these were accused of being glorified toy commercials by parents' groups such as [[Action for Children's Television]]. These groups also objected to the level of violence in many of these shows. ACT's efforts to curb these trends resulted in the [[Children's Television Act]], enacted in 1990 and strictly enforced by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] starting in 1996.

====Anime comes to America====
Throughout this period, Japanese [[anime]] production made a limited impact on the [[North America]]n market.  The most notable work were the television series like ''[[Battle of The Planets]]'' and ''[[Star Blazers]]'' in the 1970s and ''[[Voltron]]'' and ''[[Robotech]]'' in the 1980s. As a rule, the imported series were heavily censored to make them acceptable to children; ''[[Star Blazers]]'' and ''[[Robotech]]'' were partial exceptions. Although their impact on the art in North America was minimal for decades, the distinctive nature of the anime series created a cult following that grew gradually until the 1980s when ''Star Blazers'' and ''Robotech'', with their complex storylines and frank depiction of violence, helped create the groundswell that would lead to the major influx of anime popularity starting in the 1990s.

====Music videos====
The 1980s also saw the rise of the [[music video]] industry''',''' spearheaded by [[MTV]]. Artistic experimentation in these short films often resulted in the production of innovative animated sequences that reminded viewers of the potential of animation as something other than [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s.  A number of memorable animated videos were produced during the heyday of MTV, including "[[Take on Me (music video)|Take on Me]]" by [[a-ha]]; "[[Sledgehammer (Peter Gabriel song)|Sledgehammer]]" by [[Peter Gabriel]]; "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]" by [[Dire Straits]]; and "[[Harlem Shuffle (song)|The Harlem Shuffle]]" by [[The Rolling Stones]] (the animated sequences in this video were directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]] and [[John Kricfalusi]]).

The player must fight through hordes of rogue robots to take back control of the Genki Star.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt; The game can be played in [[single-player]] or in [[local cooperative]] play with up to four players.&lt;ref name="rps_release" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer_release" /&gt; The game features four game modes: a story, campaign, a challenging 50 layer mode, Infinity Drive, daily challenges, Daily Drive, and [[boss rush]] mode.&lt;ref name="eurogamer_release" /&gt; The game has nine playable androids to choose from,&lt;ref name="eurogamer_release" /&gt; each of which have a different combination of primary and secondary weapons.&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt; The game includes 25 stages which morph and transform as the level progresses.&lt;ref name="eurogamer_release" /&gt;&lt;ref name="destructoid_review" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19658">'''Auction theory''' is an applied branch of [[economics]] which deals with how people act in [[auction]] markets and researches the properties of auction markets. There are many possible designs (or sets of rules) for an auction and typical issues studied by auction theorists include the [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] of a given auction design, [[optimal]] and equilibrium bidding strategies, and revenue comparison. Auction theory is also used as a tool to inform the design of real-world auctions; most notably auctions for the privatization of public-sector companies or the sale of licenses for use of the electromagnetic spectrum.

==General idea==
Auctions are characterized as transactions with a specific set of rules detailing resource allocation according to participants' bids. They are categorized as games with incomplete information because in the vast majority of auctions, one party will possess information related to the transaction that the other party does not (e.g., the bidders usually know their personal valuation of the item, which is unknown to the other bidders and the seller).&lt;ref name="McAffeeandMcMillan" /&gt; Auctions take many forms, but they share the characteristic that they are ''universal'' and can be used to sell or buy any item. In many cases, the outcome of the auction does not depend on the identity of the bidders (i.e., auctions are ''anonymous''){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

Most auctions have the feature that participants submit ''bids'', amounts of money they are willing to pay. ''Standard'' auctions require that the winner of the auction is the participant with the highest bid. A ''nonstandard'' auction does not require this (e.g., a lottery).

==Types of auction==
{{Main|Auction#Types}}

There are traditionally four types of auction that are used for the allocation of a single item:

* [[First-price sealed-bid auctions]] in which bidders place their bid in a sealed envelope and simultaneously hand them to the auctioneer. The envelopes are opened and the individual with the highest bid wins, paying the amount bid.
* [[Sealed second-price auction|Second-price sealed-bid auctions (Vickrey auctions)]] in which bidders place their bid in a sealed envelope and simultaneously hand them to the auctioneer. The envelopes are opened and the individual with the highest bid wins, paying a price equal to the ''second-highest'' bid.
* [[English auction|Open ascending-bid auctions (English auctions)]] in which participants make increasingly higher bids, each stopping bidding when they are not prepared to pay more than the current highest bid. This continues until no participant is prepared to make a higher bid; the highest bidder wins the auction at the final amount bid. Sometimes the lot is only actually sold if the bidding reaches a reserve price set by the seller.
* [[Dutch auction|Open descending-bid auctions (Dutch auctions)]] in which the price is set by the auctioneer at a level sufficiently high to deter all bidders, and is progressively lowered until a bidder is prepared to buy at the current price, winning the auction.

Most auction theory revolves around these four "basic" auction types. However, other auction types have also received some academic study (see [[Auction#Types|Auction Types]]).

=== Benchmark model ===
The ''benchmark model'' for auctions, as defined by McAfee and McMillan (1987), offers a generalization of auction formats, and is based on four assumptions:
# All of the bidders are risk-neutral.
# Each bidder has a private valuation for the item independently drawn from some probability distribution.
# The bidders possess symmetric information.
# The payment is represented as a function of only the bids.
The benchmark model is often used in tandem with the ''Revelation Principle'', which states that each of the basic auction types is structured such that each bidder has incentive to report their valuation honestly. The two are primarily used by sellers to determine the auction type that maximizes the expected price. This optimal auction format is defined such that the item will be offered to the bidder with the highest valuation at a price equal to their valuation, but the seller will refuse to sell the item if they expect that all of the bidders' valuations of the item are less than their own.&lt;ref name="McAffeeandMcMillan" /&gt;

Relaxing each of the four main assumptions of the benchmark model yields auction formats with unique characteristics:
* ''Risk-averse bidders'' incur some kind of cost from participating in risky behaviors, which affects their valuation of a product. In sealed-bid first-price auctions, risk-averse bidders are more willing to bid more to increase their probability of winning, which, in turn, increases their expected utility. This allows sealed-bid first-price auctions to produce higher expected revenue than English and sealed-bid second-price auctions.
* In formats with ''correlated values''—where the bidders’ values for the item are not independent—one of the bidders perceiving their value of the item to be high makes it more likely that the other bidders will perceive their own values to be high. A notable example of this instance is the ''Winner’s curse'', where the results of the auction convey to the winner that everyone else estimated the value of the item to be less than they did. Additionally, the [[linkage principle]] allows revenue comparisons amongst a fairly general class of auctions with interdependence between bidders' values.
* The ''asymmetric model'' assumes that bidders are separated into two classes that draw valuations from different distributions (i.e., dealers and collectors in an antiques auction).
* In formats with ''royalties or incentive payments'', the seller incorporates additional factors, especially those that affect the true value of the item (e.g., supply, production costs, and royalty payments), into the price function.&lt;ref name="McAffeeandMcMillan" /&gt;

==Game-theoretic models==
A game-theoretic auction model is a [[Game theory#Representation of games|mathematical game]] represented by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of players, a set of actions ([[Strategy|strategies]]) available to each player, and a payoff [[vector (geometric)|vector]] corresponding to each [[combination]] of strategies. Generally, the players are the buyer(s) and the seller(s). The action set of each player is a set of bid [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] or [[reservation price]]s (reserves). Each bid function maps the player's [[Value (economics)|value]] (in the case of a buyer) or [[cost]] (in the case of a seller) to a bid [[price]]. The payoff of each player under a combination of strategies is the [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]] (or [[Expected value|expected]] profit) of that player under that combination of strategies.

Game-theoretic models of auctions and strategic bidding generally fall into either of the following two categories. In a [[private values auction model|private value model]], each participant (bidder) assumes that each of the [[Competition|competing]] bidders obtains a [[random]] ''private value'' from a [[probability distribution]]. In a [[Common value auction|common value]] model, the participants have equal valuations of the item, but they do not have perfectly accurate information about this valuation. In lieu of knowing the exact valuation of the item, each participant can assume that any other participant obtains a random signal, which can be used to estimate the true valuation, from a probability distribution common to all bidders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategy: An Introduction to Game Theory, Third Edition|last=Watson|first=Joel|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2013|isbn=978-0-393-91838-0|location=New York, NY|pages=360–377|chapter=Chapter 27: Lemons, Auctions, and Information Aggregation|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, but not always, a private values model assumes that the values are [[Statistical independence|independent]] across bidders, whereas a common value model usually assumes that the values are independent up to the common [[parameter]]s of the probability distribution.

A more general category for strategic bidding is the ''affiliated values model'', in which the bidder's total utility depends on both their individual private signal and some unknown common value. Both the private value and common value models can be perceived as extensions of the general affiliated values model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Tong|last2=Perrigne|first2=Isabelle|last3=Vuong|first3=Quang|year=2002|title=Structural Estimation of the Affiliated Private Value Auction Model|url=|journal=The RAND Journal of Economics|volume=33|issue=2|pages=171–193|jstor=3087429|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EnumaElish102.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Ex-post equilibrium in a simple auction market.]]When it is necessary to make explicit assumptions about bidders' value [[Probability distribution|distributions]], most of the published research assumes [[Symmetric game|symmetric]] bidders. This means that the probability distribution from which the bidders obtain their values (or signals) is identical across bidders. In a private values model which assumes independence, symmetry implies that the bidders' values are [[I.i.d.|independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)]].
An important example (which does not assume independence) is [[Paul Milgrom|Milgrom]] and [[Robert J. Weber|Weber]]'s "general symmetric model" (1982).&lt;ref&gt;Milgrom, P., and R. Weber (1982) "A Theory of Auctions and Competitive Bidding," Econometrica Vol. 50 No. 5, pp. 1089–1122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Because bidders in real-world auctions are rarely symmetric, applied scientists began to research auctions with asymmetric value distributions beginning in the late 1980s.  Such applied research often depended on [[Numerical solution|numerical solution algorithms]] to compute an equilibrium and establish its properties.  Preston McAfee and John McMillan (1989) simulated bidding for a government contract in which the cost distribution of domestic firms is different from the cost distribution of the foreign firms ("Government Procurement and International Trade," ''Journal of International Economics'', Vol. 26, pp. 291–308.)  One of the publications based on the earliest numerical research is Dalkir, S., J. W. Logan, and R. T. Masson, "Mergers in Symmetric and Asymmetric Noncooperative Auction Markets: The Effects on Prices and Efficiency," published in Vol. 18 of ''The International Journal of Industrial Organization'', (2000, pp. 383–413).  Other pioneering research include Tschantz, S., P. Crooke, and L. Froeb, "Mergers in Sealed versus Oral Auctions," published in Vol. 7 of ''The International Journal of the Economics of Business'' (2000, pp. 201–213).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earlier published theoretical research addressing properties of auctions among asymmetric bidders is Keith Waehrer's 1999 article.&lt;ref&gt;K. Waehrer (1999) "Asymmetric Auctions With Application to Joint Bidding and Mergers," International Journal of Industrial Organization '''17''': 437–452&lt;/ref&gt;  Later published research include [[Susan Athey]]'s 2001 Econometrica article,&lt;ref&gt;Athey, S. (2001) "Single Crossing Properties and the Existence of Pure Strategy Equilibria in Games of Incomplete Information," Econometrica Vol. 69 No. 4, pp. 861–890.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Reny and Zamir (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Reny, P., and S. Zamir (2004) "On the Existence of Pure Strategy Monotone Equilibria in Asymmetric First-Price Auctions," Econometrica, Vol. 72 No. 4, pp. 1105–1125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first formal analysis of auctions was by [[William Vickrey]] (1961). Vickrey considers two buyers bidding for a single item. Each buyer's value, v, is an independent draw from a uniform distribution with support [0,1]. Vickrey showed that in the sealed first-price auction it is an equilibrium bidding strategy for each bidder to bid half his valuation. With more bidders, all drawing a value from the same uniform distribution it is easy to show that the symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy is 
:&lt;math&gt;B(v)=\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)v&lt;/math&gt;.
To check that this is an equilibrium bidding strategy we must show that if it is the strategy adopted by the other n-1 buyers, then it is a best response for buyer 1 to adopt it also. Note that buyer 1 wins with probability 1 with a bid of (n-1)/n so we need only consider bids on the interval [0,(n-1)/n]. Suppose buyer 1 has value v and bids b. If buyer 2's value is x he bids B(x). Therefore buyer 1 beats buyer 2 if

:&lt;math&gt;B(x)=\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)x&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;  that is  &lt;math&gt;x&lt;\left(\frac{n}{n-1}\right)b&lt;/math&gt;
Since x is uniformly distributed, buyer 1 bids higher than buyer 2 with probability nb/(n-1). To be the winning bidder, buyer 1 must bid higher than all the other bidders (which are bidding independently). Then his win probability is
:&lt;math&gt;w(b)=\Pr {{\{{{b}_{2}}&lt;b\}}^{n-1}}={{\left(\frac{n}{n-1}\right)}^{n-1}}{{b}^{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
Buyer 1's expected payoff is his win probability times his gain if he wins. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;U(b)=w(b)(v-b)={{\left(\frac{n}{n-1}\right)}^{n-1}}{{b}^{n-1}}(v-b)={{\left(\frac{n}{n-1}\right)}^{n-1}}({{b}^{n-1}}v-{{b}^{n}})&lt;/math&gt;
It is readily confirmed by differentiation that U(b) takes on its maximum at 
:&lt;math&gt;B(v)=\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)v&lt;/math&gt;

It is not difficult to show that B(v) is the unique symmetric equilibrium. Lebrun (1996)&lt;ref&gt;Lebrun, Bernard (1996) "Existence of an equilibrium in first price auctions," Economic Theory, Vol. 7 No. 3, pp. 421–443.&lt;/ref&gt; provides a  general proof that there are no asymmetric equilibria.

==Revenue equivalence==
{{Main|Revenue equivalence}}
One of the major findings of auction theory is the celebrated '''Revenue equivalence theorem'''. Early equivalence results focused on a comparison of revenue in the most common auctions. The first such proof, for the case of two buyers and uniformly distributed values was by {{Harvtxt|Vickrey|1961}}. In 1979 {{harvtxt|Riley|Samuelson|1981}} proved a much more general result. (Quite independently and soon after, this was also derived by {{Harvtxt|Myerson|1981}}).The [[revenue equivalence theorem]] states that any allocation mechanism or auction that satisfies the four main assumptions of the benchmark model will lead to the same expected revenue for the seller (and player ''i'' of type ''v'' can expect the same surplus across auction types).&lt;ref name="McAffeeandMcMillan" /&gt;

Relaxing these assumptions can provide valuable insights for auction design. Decision biases can also lead to predictable non-equivalencies. Additionally, if some bidders are known to have a higher valuation for the lot, techniques such as price-discriminating against such bidders will yield higher returns. In other words, if a bidder is known to value the lot at $X more than the next highest bidder, the seller can increase their profits by charging that bidder $X – Δ (a sum just slightly inferior to the sum is willing to pay) more than any other bidder (or equivalently a special bidding fee of $X – Δ). This bidder will still win the lot, but will pay more than would otherwise be the case.&lt;ref name="McAffeeandMcMillan"&gt;{{cite_journal |last=McAfee |first=R. Preston |authorlink2=John McMillan (economist) |first2=John |last2=McMillan |year=1987 |title=Auctions and Bidding |journal=[[Journal of Economic Literature]] |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=699–738 |jstor=2726107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winner's curse==

The [[winner's curse]] is a phenomenon which can occur in ''common value'' settings—when the actual values to the different bidders are unknown but correlated, and the bidders make bidding decisions based on estimated values. In such cases, the winner will tend to be the bidder with the highest estimate, but the results of the auction will show that the remaining bidders' estimates of the item's value are less than that of the winner, giving the winner the impression that they "bid too much".&lt;ref name="McAffeeandMcMillan" /&gt;

In an equilibrium of such a game, the winner's curse does not occur because the bidders account for the bias in their bidding strategies. Behaviorally and empirically, however, winner's curse is a common phenomenon. (cf. [[Richard Thaler]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2797">'''Ballarat Regional Tourism''' (trading as '''Visit Ballarat''') is the separate, relatively autonomous tourism arm of the [[City of Ballarat]]. The board was created on January 27, 2011 to enable the local tourism sector to take ownership of destination promotion of Greater [[Ballarat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballarat Regional Tourism comes of age |url=http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/about-council/communications-and-publications/media-releases/january-2011/ballarat-regional-tourism-comes-of-age-.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319172832/http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/about-council/communications-and-publications/media-releases/january-2011/ballarat-regional-tourism-comes-of-age-.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new organisation commenced operations on February 1, 2011 which is when it took over key tourism management responsibilities formerly handled by the Ballarat City Council. Responsibilities of the new tourism arm include promotion of Ballarat and surrounding areas as a tourist destination; providing visitor information through the Visitor Information Centre, and developing and attracting tourism and business events.

During its first year, the organisation was managed by a private sector board with the city council retaining ownership. On March 14, 2012 the city council voted to transfer Ballarat Regional Tourism's ownership to the private sector. The council will still continue to fund the board contingent on it meeting key performance indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballarat Regional Tourism's new ownership welcomed|url=http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/ballarat-regional-tourisms-new-ownership-welcomed/2492161.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose''''' is the ninth studio album by [[Meat Loaf]], and the third and final one in the ''Bat Out of Hell'' trilogy. It was released in Ireland on October 20 2006, 29 years after ''[[Bat Out of Hell]]'' (1977), and 13 years after ''[[Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell]]'' (1993). It was released in the UK on October 23, 2006, and in the US on October 31, 2006.

Produced by [[Desmond Child]], it is the only ''Bat'' album not involving [[Jim Steinman]] in its production. The album was subject to a legal dispute between Meat Loaf and Steinman, who had registered the phrase "Bat Out of Hell" as a [[trademark]] and attempted to prevent the album using the phrase. In the end, seven songs that Steinman wrote for various other projects were included.

As with its predecessors, the album received mixed reviews. A tour, named [[The Seize the Night Tour]], followed the release, concentrating upon songs from the ''Bat'' albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jonathan |last=Cohen |work=Billboard |title=Meat Loaf Awakens The Beast For 'Bat III' |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/57666/meat-loaf-awakens-the-beast-for-bat-iii |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929155620/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/57666/meat-loaf-awakens-the-beast-for-bat-iii |archivedate=2007-09-29 |accessdate=2006-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to a [[Reuters]] report, Meat Loaf and Steinman started working on an album in 2001.&lt;ref name="graff"&gt;{{cite news |first=Gary |last=Graff |title=Meat Loaf unleashes "Bat" for third flight |date=2006-10-28 |work=Reuters |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUKN2716092720061030 |accessdate=2007-09-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071017143837/http://uk.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUKN2716092720061030| archivedate= 17 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the concerts in his ''Hair of the Dog'' tour, Meat Loaf made a point to mention that he and Steinman were putting out a new album.

The composer suffered some health setbacks around 2004. Meat Loaf says that "lawyers worked for over a year putting together a contract for Steinman to do ''Bat Out of Hell III''. It was one of the best producer's contracts in the history of the record business." Ultimately, according to the singer, Steinman was not well enough to work on such an intense project and made what he calls the "selfish" decision to go ahead without him. In promotional interviews he said that he did not want to wait a year and a half just to find out that Steinman was still unfit.&lt;ref name="thismorning"&gt;{{cite interview |title=Meat Loaf |interviewer=[[Ruth Langsford]], [[Phillip Schofield]] |publisher=ITV1 |location= London |date=May 2007 |work=[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing himself as a "really loyal  person," Meat Loaf says that "the decision not to use Steinman has taken its toll on me."&lt;ref name="graff"/&gt;

However, in 2006, [[David Sonenberg]], Steinman's manager, said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jim's health is excellent. That's not the reason he didn't participate in (''Bat III''). He had some meaningful health problems about four years ago, but he's been totally healthy the last couple of years. His health in no way impacted on his involvement in the ''Bat Out of Hell'' project.&lt;ref name="graff"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The development problems and confusion over Steinman's involvement is a result of a dispute of the [[trademark]] "Bat Out of Hell", which Steinman registered in 1995.&lt;ref name="butler"&gt;{{cite web |first=Susan |last=Butler |work=Billboard |title=Meat Loaf Sues Over 'Bat Out Of Hell' |url=http://www.neverlandhotel.dk/news/index.php?nr=155 |accessdate=2006-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426042502/http://www.neverlandhotel.dk/news/index.php?nr=155 |archivedate=2008-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meat Loaf sued Steinman and his manager, in a complaint filed May 28, 2006 in federal District Court in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], for $50 million and to prevent further use by the writer/producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MEAT LOAF BATTLES FOR BAT OUT OF HELL TRADEMARK |date=2006-06-06 |work=contactmusic.com |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/meat%20loaf%20battles%20for%20bat%20out%20of%20hell%20trademark_06_06_2006 |accessdate=2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meat Loaf has stated that he contributed lyrics to "Bat Out of Hell". He had used the phrase extensively for tours, to which Steinman had never objected "until a recent falling out."&lt;ref name="butler"/&gt; Steinman and his representatives approached Meat Loaf's labels, Universal and Virgin, asserting trademark ownership and threatening litigation&lt;ref name="butler"/&gt; to prevent the album's release.&lt;ref name="cnasia"&gt;{{cite news |first=Zul |last=Othman |title=Man out of hell |date=2006-10-26 |work=ChannelNews Asia |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/237668/1/.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20061107091041/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/237668/1/.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-11-07 |accessdate=2006-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement was reached in Summer 2006. According to Virgin, "the two came to an amicable agreement that ensured that Jim Steinman's music would be a continuing part of the 'Bat Out of Hell' legacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MEATLOAF REACHES AGREEMENT OVER BAT OUT OF HELL |date=2006-08-01 |work=contactmusic.com |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/meatloaf%20reaches%20agreement%20over%20bat%20out%20of%20hell_1004104 |accessdate=2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In promotional interviews, Meat Loaf has played down the dispute with Steinman, pointing out that it was over in three weeks and was purely for the sake of business.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I consider him to be one of my best friends but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, we had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of ''Bat Out of Hell III'' without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.&lt;ref name="cnasia"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the fact that Steinman was not involved in the recording or production, the album does include seven of his songs, five of which are covers of previously released songs. The other two were covers of Steinman's demos intended for musical theater projects, at the time unreleased. The agreement enabled Steinman to work on a musical theatre project based on all of the songs from ''Bat Out of Hell''. Describing the project as "''[[Cirque du Soleil]]'' on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]", in September 2007, he expected it to open in [[London]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="cour"&gt;{{cite news|first=Maryellen |last=Fillo |title=A Bat Out Of Hell Who Whistles |work=Hartford Courant |url=http://www.courant.com/features/lifestyle/hc-nujavaspilling0928.artsep28,0,6539032.story |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2007-09-29 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Meat Loaf had announced that [[Michael Beinhorn]] was producing the record, but [[Desmond Child]] took the helm. The singer reports that Child would say things that made him think he was sitting next to Steinman.&lt;ref name="radio2"&gt;{{cite interview |title=Meat Loaf |interviewer=[[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] |publisher=BBC Radio 2 |location= London |date= 2006-08-04 |work=Steve Wright in the Afternoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child began recording sessions by playing [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] CDs to get the assembled musicians in the mood.&lt;ref name="graff"/&gt; In addition to musicians from his touring band, the [[Neverland Express]], several guest players contributed to the album. Meat Loaf says, "I didn't just want to bring in rock players — I wanted to go to extreme rock people" resulting in an album that "has all the touches of the other two ''Bats'', but it's much more of a rock album."&lt;ref name="graff"/&gt; Child says that one of the most memorable experiences working on the album was working with [[Brian May]], who played on "Bad for Good".&lt;ref name="mob2"&gt;{{cite video |date=2006 |title=The Making of Bat Out of Hell III | medium=DVD |publisher=Mercury Records}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album also featured guest performances by [[John 5 (guitarist)|John 5]], [[Steve Vai]] and [[John Shanks]].

Meat Loaf says that he does not enjoy recording in studios. He compares the process to "going to the dentist and having [[root canal]] everyday". Whereas you ''really'' have to be flat for people to notice it in a live show, in a studio, every "nuance is under a microscope... and I'm a perfectionist who knows that there's no such thing as perfection but I try to get as close as I can."&lt;ref name="thismorning"/&gt;

[[Todd Rundgren]], who produced the first album and arranged all of the background vocals for ''Bat II'', arranged the background vocals for three tracks. In a promotional interview for the album Rundgren has said "continuity is an important thing."&lt;ref name="mob2"/&gt; However, in another interview he said that his contribution was considerably less than on some earlier Meat Loaf albums.

&lt;blockquote&gt;And by the time they got it all organized and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and [[Kasim Sulton|Kasim]]... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Will |last=Harris |title=A Chat with Todd Rundgren |work=bullz-eye.com |url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/music/interviews/2007/todd_rundgren.htm |date=2006-12-01 |accessdate=2007-09-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070826231725/http://www.bullz-eye.com/music/interviews/2007/todd_rundgren.htm| archivedate= 26 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The album features three duets. Norwegian vocalist [[Marion Raven]] duets on "It's All Coming Back to Me Now". "What About Love?" features [[Patti Russo]], who has toured with Meat Loaf for over thirteen years. Finally, [[Jennifer Hudson]] performs on "The Future Ain't What It Used to Be".

==Compositions==
The album opens with the title track. "The Monster Is Loose" is highly influenced by the Gothic style of [[John 5 (guitarist)|John 5]], who plays the main guitar parts. The song is very heavy and continues Meat Loaf's association with [[Major League Baseball]] established with [[Phil Rizzuto]]'s commentary on "[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]."&lt;ref name="graff"/&gt; "Blind as a Bat", written by Desmond Child, tells about how one is thankful for the love another has given him, even after he has done deeds to suggest that he does not deserve such love.&lt;ref&gt;"Blind as a Bat", written by Desmond Child&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Steinman, "[[It's All Coming Back to Me Now]]" was inspired by ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', and was an attempt to write "the most passionate, romantic song" he could ever create.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=JimSteinman.com |title=Jim Steinman on "It's All Coming Back To Me Now" |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/backtome.htm |accessdate=2006-09-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060903072121/http://www.jimsteinman.com/backtome.htm| archivedate= 3 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, Meat Loaf has said that, in his mind, the song was always meant to be a duet.&lt;ref name="Asia"&gt;{{cite news |first=Zul |last=Othman |title=Man out of hell |work=Channel NewsAsia |date=2006-10-26 |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/237668/1/.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20061107091041/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/237668/1/.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-11-07 |accessdate=2006-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian artist [[Marion Raven]], who had been working on her solo album with Child, was chosen because the [[timbre]] of her voice starkly contrasts to Meat Loaf's.&lt;ref name="xmr"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Bat Out of Hell III |series=Liner Notes |network =[[XM Satellite Radio]] |airdate=2006-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bad for Good" was one of the many songs written by Steinman under the inspiration of ''[[Peter Pan]]'' and [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|lost boys]] who never grow up.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |title=BBC Rock Hour Special: Jim Steinman; Transcription of BBC Radio Broadcast, 1981 |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/bbc.htm |accessdate=2007-08-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070814030841/http://www.jimsteinman.com/bbc.htm| archivedate= 14 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in lyrics such as "You know I'm gonna be like this forever/I'm never gonna be what I should." The song was written to appear on the follow-up to ''Bat Out of Hell'', but which Steinman recorded himself. Because of this, Meat Loaf was aware that there is a "core of fans that know that song," so he "had that under the microscope more than any other on the album."&lt;ref name="mob2"/&gt;

"[[Cry Over Me]]" is, according to Meat Loaf, a timeless song dealing with relationships of all kinds. In a 2007 interview, he says that it can be about your first or last loves, or dealing with your boss at work. Partially quoting the lyrics, the singer posits that there are times when "you want him to feel exactly like I felt when he said that to me."&lt;ref name="thismorning"/&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' says "In the Land of the Pig (The Butcher Is King)" is "five Olympian minutes crying out for a full production at [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Caroline |last=Sullivan |title=Meat Loaf, Bat Out of Hell III |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,1926073,00.html |work=The Guardian |date=2006-10-20 |accessdate=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarist [[Steve Vai]] describes it as "very Gothic; almost terrifying."&lt;ref name="mob2"/&gt; It is about the intense power over subordinates:

:''Can't you hear the choir now?''
:''Listen to the animals sing.''
:''Can't you hear the [[slaughterhouse]] bells?''
:''In the land of the pigs the butcher is king.''

"Monstro" is a bombastic orchestral piece layered with chorals that lead into the piano introduction to "Alive." Meat Loaf decided to hire Desmond Child when he revealed that he had written "Alive" especially for the album. The song refers to how the singer has overcome difficult periods in his life.&lt;ref name="xmr"/&gt;

"What About Love", a piano-based duet with [[Patti Russo]], is a sexually charged song that echoes "[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]" from the 1977 album. Here, though, the singers are singing about love throughout, not bitterness. The final verse contains the most explicit lyrics about their first sexual encounter.

:''[Boy:]''
:''I can't forget the feeling of your sweat upon my skin.''
:''And the tremble of your body on the day you let me in...''

:''[Girl:]''
:''On a summernight's surrender with nothing to lose.''
:''You were scared and so was I when I gave myself to you...''

"Seize the Night" has a strong orchestral foundation underneath the lead vocals and a choir. A duet with [[Jennifer Hudson]], "The Future Ain't What It Used to Be" is a pessimistic song based upon the myth that [[Pandora]] closed her jar before allowing "hope" to escape (the song first appeared on the only album performed by female group [[Pandora's Box (band)|Pandora's Box]]). The lyrics reveal the hopelessness of the past (''Were there ever any stars in the sky?'') and the future (''There's nothing so sad as a tomorrow gone bad'').

The final song of the ''Bat'' trilogy is a short one written by Steinman. A few lyrics of ''Cry to Heaven'' begin rather sweet, but turning rather bitter: (''Cry baby cry/Cry, cry to heaven/If that doesn't do it for you/Go ahead and cry like hell''.) The two parts are bridged by an instrumental dominated by an [[Irish flute]].

==Cover and booklet==
The cover follows the style of the previous two albums called ''Bat Out of Hell''. [[Julie Bell]] designed the cover and the artwork that appears alongside the lyrics in the booklet. She also supplied the art for the "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" single. The cover features the biker from the first two covers about to slay the giant bat from the second cover, while the angel from the same cover takes cover behind a destroyed pillar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Randall |last=Larson |work=Cinescape |title=New Bat Out Of Hell Album from Meat Loaf |url=http://www.cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0&amp;this_cat=Music+%26+Audio&amp;action=page&amp;type_id=&amp;cat_id=270466&amp;obj_id=51370# |accessdate=2006-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009001656/http://www.cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0 |archive-date=2006-10-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the first two ''Bat'' albums, Steinman's songwriting is credited on the cover, this time shared with Desmond Child.

The booklet contains all of the lyrics to the songs, each page featuring a small illustration. The CD liner contains a dedication "For thirty years of friendship and inspiration, ''Bat Out of Hell III'' is dedicated to Jim Steinman."

The album debuted at #8 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold about 81,000 copies in its opening week, his best since ''Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Hasty |title='Montana' Zooms By Manilow For Second Week At No. 1 |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56725/montana-zooms-by-manilow-for-second-week-at-no-1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133257/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56725/montana-zooms-by-manilow-for-second-week-at-no-1 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |work=Billboard.com |date=2006-11-08 |accessdate=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it slipped to #60 after three weeks. The album also reached #3 in the UK charts, but quickly fell off.

''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' gave the album a positive review, calling it "the second-best album to bear the 'Bat' name", and saying that Child did an "impressive recreation of Steinman's [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]-on-steroids approach", while the album was "overblown, frequently ridiculous and largely devoid of irony." They were unimpressed with the title track, suggesting that "whoever decided it would be a good idea for Meat Loaf to tackle [[nu metal]]…should be tarred and feathered." ''Q'' did, however, praise the "operatic" vocals and May's "fabulously hysterical guitar" on the track "Bad for Good".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Village Voice]]'' named it as 'Album of the Year This Week', calling it "absurdist, righteous majesty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rob |last=Harvilla |title=Stuff You Need to Know This Week to Avoid Ostracism |work=The Village Voice |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0641,harvilla,74677,22.html |accessdate=2006-10-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016035941/http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0641%2Charvilla%2C74677%2C22.html |archivedate=16 October 2006 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviews lamented Steinman's absence. According to [[AllMusic]], "this ''Bat'' is quite obviously a patchwork, pieced together from things borrowed and recreated, never quite gelling the way either of the previous ''Bats'' did." They criticized "The Monster Is Loose" as a "disarming, a grindingly metallic riff-rocker that sits very uncomfortably next to Steinman's "It's All Coming Back to Me Now", and Child as "a professional who is playing a game without bothering to learn the rules." On the other hand, the review commended Meat Loaf's voice: he sings "his heart out as he valiantly tries to make this ''Bat'' a worthy successor to the originals."&lt;ref name="AllMusic"/&gt;

"It's All Coming Back to Me Now" was the first song released as a single.

Told in flashback, Raven's character crashes her car to avoid a man standing in the road. She sings as an unseen spirit following Meat Loaf. It echoes Steinman's comments that the song is about the "dark side of love" and the "ability to be resurrected by it."&lt;ref name="jsopb"&gt;{{cite video |people=Jim Steinman |date=1989 |title=Jim Steinman Opens Pandora's Box | medium=DVD |publisher=Virgin Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video for "Cry over Me" had the lowest budget since those for the original album. A simple video, Meat Loaf has said that it only took four hours to film.&lt;ref name="thismorning"/&gt; The animated music video for "The Monster Is Loose" is about a biker who rescues a girl from an enormous bat-like creature.

The videos for "It's All Coming Back to Me Now", "Cry over Me" and "The Monster Is Loose" are included as bonus features on the ''[[3 Bats Live]]'' DVD, released in October 2007.

All of the [[Jim Steinman]] songs were written for other projects. Like ''Bat II'',&lt;ref&gt;"It Just Won't Quit" and "[[Good Girls Go to Heaven (Bad Girls Go Everywhere)]]"&lt;/ref&gt; the album contains two songs ("It's All Coming Back..." and "The Future Ain't What It Used to Be") that originally appeared on ''[[Original Sin (Pandora's Box album)|Original Sin]]'', Steinman's 1989 [[concept album]] with [[Pandora's Box (band)|Pandora's Box]]. Steinman's demo of "In the Land of the Pig, the Butcher Is King" was part of the preparations for the unrealized ''Batman: The Musical'' project. Steinman's "Cry to Heaven" demo was intended for the possibility that Steinman would provide songs for a musical based on the film ''[[Cry-Baby]]''. ''[[Cry-Baby (musical)|Cry-Baby]]'' has since been staged, but without any work from Steinman. "Bad for Good" was featured as the title track on Steinman's [[Bad for Good|1981 album]]. Some of the songs on the ''[[Bad for Good]]'' album were once intended to be a Meat Loaf solo album. "Seize the Night" first appeared as "Carpe Noctem" in the German language musical ''[[Dance of the Vampires (musical)|Tanz der Vampire]]''. It was also performed in English in the 2002 Broadway show called ''[[Dance of the Vampires (musical)|Dance of the Vampires]]'', and demos of the song in English became widely available around that time. "If It Ain't Broke, Break It" first appeared in the MTV film ''[[Wuthering Heights (2003 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'', and a recording of the song was released on the soundtrack CD for the film.

A limited edition was released with an accompanying DVD, containing a short "making of" featurette, the animated trailer, and "The Monster is Loose" career montage video. The US version also includes a photo gallery and the "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" video.

[[Best Buy]]'s version of the album came with an exclusive bonus track: a live version of "Testify" (from ''[[Couldn't Have Said It Better]]''). This track was originally announced to be on the CD itself, but Best Buy opted to include an insert in the packaging giving customers a code to download the song. [[Circuit City (1949–2009 company)|Circuit City]]'s version came with an exclusive downloadable track: a live version of "Life Is a Lemon and I Want My Money Back". [[Target Corporation|Target]] released a "Limited Tour Edition" with a concert ticket pre-sale offer. [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] released the album as part of an exclusive 2-pack with the ''Meat Loaf Bat Out of Hell [[Classic Albums]]'' DVD.

The version of the album available from [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[iTunes Store]] includes two bonus tracks, a live version of "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)", recorded at a concert in Australia, and "Heads Will Roll", sung by Marion Raven from her [[Heads Will Roll (EP)|EP of the same name]].

==Tour==
Meat Loaf embarked on a 112 date world tour to promote the album. He performed a concert performing some songs from all three ''Bat Out of Hell'' albums on October 16 at [[London]]'s [[Royal Albert Hall]], and performed many of those songs on the rest of his tour as well. He also performed a "Bat on Broadway" performance on November 2, 2006 at [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theater]], as well as shows in [[Toronto]], [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[Uncasville, Connecticut|Uncasville]], and [[Mexico City]].

Marion Raven joined Meat Loaf for the first leg of his 2007 tour, [[Seize the Night tour]]. She was the supporting act, promoting her ''[[Set Me Free (Marion Raven album)|Set Me Free]]'' album. Meat Loaf introduced her on stage at the latter stages of the concerts to duet on "It's All Coming Back to Me Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Norwegian singer tours UK with Meat Loaf |work=norway.org.uk |url=http://www.norway.org.uk/culture/music/marion-raven.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203846/http://www.norway.org.uk/culture/music/marion-raven.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A DVD of the tour was released in October 2007, entitled ''[[3 Bats Live]]''. It also contains a bonus disc featuring the promotional videos and animations from ''Bat III''.

Portions of the tour were captured on film in the [[Theatrical]] [[Documentary film|Documentary]] ''[[Meat Loaf: In Search of Paradise]]'', directed by Bruce David Klein, which was released in 2008.

'''''Batman Eternal''''' is a year-long weekly [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] published by [[DC Comics]], that began in April 2014. The series featured [[Batman]], his allies, and [[Gotham City]], and was written by [[Scott Snyder]], [[James Tynion IV]], Ray Fawkes, [[Kyle Higgins]], and [[Tim Seeley]]. [[John Layman]] was originally scheduled to write for the series as well, before leaving the project in January 2014 and being replaced by Higgins; his final issue was issue 10. &lt;!--The first series consisted of 52 issues, though Snyder initially said it might contain 60.&lt;ref name="EternalComicosity" /&gt;--&gt; ''Batman Eternal'' ran through April 2015, after which it took a hiatus, before returning in October 2015 for a 26-issue weekly sequel series titled ''[[Batman and Robin Eternal]]''.

==Publication history==
In October 2013, [[DC Comics]] announced the series would launch in early 2014, with [[Scott Snyder]] heading the story. Additional writers include [[James Tynion IV]], [[John Layman]], Ray Fawkes, and [[Tim Seeley]], with art at the beginning handled by Jason Fabok. Snyder and Tynion co-wrote the first story arc, which lays the groundwork for the series. The story lines then move to a bigger story that includes Snyder's ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' title, once it finishes the "[[Batman: Zero Year|Zero Year]]" story line. The series is part of the 75th anniversary celebration of [[Batman]].&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt;

In November 2013, Snyder released a teaser image by Fabok, titled "Happy Batsgiving", inspired by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]]' ''The First Thanksgiving 1621''.&lt;ref name="Batsgiving2" /&gt; The image was intended to be "full of Easter eggs and teases" for the series.&lt;ref name="Batsgiving" /&gt; In December 2013, Seeley stated that Snyder and Tynion created the overarching plot threads of the series to keep each writer progressing, but then further broke the whole story down to different genres for each writer to work in.&lt;ref name="SeeleyRama"/&gt; Fawkes also added that each writer takes turns being the "lead" on the issue, while the others continue to contribute their parts to the issue.&lt;ref name="FawkesRama"/&gt;

In January 2014, Snyder revealed that each writer is writing arcs to the series, opposed to each writer working together on a single issue. Snyder said, "it might be more difficult or tricky to do a series where each one of us is doing an arc that leads to the next arc, but we liked that idea. We liked that challenge." To aid in this, a large document containing the whole story was created to help map out where large moments needed to occur, and how to aid in connecting each writer's arcs.&lt;ref name="SnyderRama" /&gt; It was also announced in January that the series would launch in April 2014, and that Layman had left the project.&lt;ref name="IGNJan2014" /&gt; Layman's final issue was issue 10,&lt;ref name="LaymanFinal" /&gt; though he still received "contributing writer" credit through issue 21. Later in the month, DC confirmed the addition of [[Kyle Higgins]] on the writing team, who wrote [[The New 52]] series ''[[Nightwing]]'' up to its penultimate issue in March 2014.&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt;

The series starts with a three-issue arc that features a glimpse at the series' end, as well as establishing the incident that drastically reshapes Gotham. Then, issues 4–7 set up smaller plots branching out from the overarching story, before shifting into three-issue arcs by the various creative teams. On the arcs, Snyder said, "Each arc reflects the tastes and the real talent of each writer, and yet at the same time it will feel really seamless and singular — like one bombastic game-changing story that rolls forward through these different neighborhoods of writing in an interesting way."&lt;ref name="USAToday2" /&gt; Seeley called issue 20 the end of "season one" of ''Eternal''.&lt;ref name="SeeleySeason1" /&gt;

In July 2014, Snyder revealed the story arc after "Zero Year" in ''Batman'', "[[Batman: Endgame|Endgame]]", would take place after the events of ''Eternal''. He revealed that issue 34 would act as a way to catch readers up to the events of ''Eternal'', without spoiling the conclusion, while also setting up the new story arc that will run from ''Batman'' #35-40.&lt;ref name="BatmanEndgame" /&gt; Starting in October 2014, along with the "Endgame" storyline, most New 52 titles in the [[List of The New 52 publications#"Batman"|"Batman" family]] take place at the end of the ''Eternal'' storyline ending in April 2015.&lt;ref name="BatTitlesEternalEnd" /&gt; At the end of October, Snyder confirmed the series would go on hiatus after April 2015,&lt;ref name="March2015Hiatus" /&gt; and would return for a second year.&lt;ref name="SecondYear" /&gt;

===''Batman'' #28===
In December 2013, Snyder announced that ''Batman'' #28, originally scheduled to be part of the "Zero Year" story, would instead act as a preview issue to ''Batman Eternal'' and the future story line in ''Batman''. The issue was written by Snyder and Tynion, with [[Dustin Nguyen (artist)|Dustin Nguyen]] and Derek Fridolfs providing the artwork.&lt;ref name="Batman28Announce" /&gt; Snyder stated that if ''Batman'' #28 was an issue of ''Eternal'' it would be issue 39.5, which equates to a year's time from the continuity seen at the end of "[[Forever Evil]]" and the start of ''Eternal'', and was done as a way to tease where ''Eternal'' would lead in 2014.&lt;ref name="Batman28Continuity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Batman28CBR" /&gt; However, the solicitations for issue 43 indicated that that issue would have close ties to ''Batman'' 28.&lt;ref name="Issue43Solicit" /&gt; 

The issue introduces a Gotham where the police are no longer allies to Batman and a curfew is being enforced. Harper Row is able to gain access to The Egyptian, the last remaining nightclub in New Gotham, where she reveals to security that her brother is sick in the Narrows at "ground zero" and was hoping to meet the new "kingpin" of Gotham to get help. When security starts to question her reason for being there, she shuts off the lights, to allow Batman to enter. Learning where to go next from a mysterious girl in the Batcave, Harper begins to help Batman remove the remaining security teams, working under the name [[Bluebird (DC Comics)|Bluebird]]. Batman and Bluebird learn that the new "kingpin" is [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]], who has quickly taken control of the underworld. They request to get something from her safe that will help the people dying in Gotham. At the safe, it is revealed Selina has [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown / The Spoiler]] tied up and she is the only one who knows how to stop what is coming next.&lt;ref name="Batman28CBR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Batman 28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Batman28Newsarama" /&gt;

==Premise and characters==
Each of the writers spoke about the different aspects of [[Batman]] and [[Gotham City]] they would be exploring in their arcs. With the main plot occurring in Snyder's and Tynion's arcs, each writer was able to incorporate different genres and aspects of the Batman universe into their stories:

* Tynion stated he would be focusing on some of the younger members of the Bat Family, including former [[Robin (comics)|Robins]] [[Tim Drake]] and Stephanie Brown. Additionally, Tynion will be introducing a larger role for the ''Gotham Gazette'' and [[Vicki Vale]], and will examine how their roles as reporters affect Gotham.&lt;ref name="TynionRama" /&gt;
* Seeley revealed he would be working within the action, espionage, and adventure genres, with his arc focused on [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]&lt;ref name="SeeleyRama" /&gt; and [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]].&lt;ref name="SeeleyRedHood" /&gt;
* Fawkes will be covering the horror genre and aspect of Gotham, while focusing on [[Batwing (DC Comics)|Batwing]]&lt;ref name="FawkesRama" /&gt; and [[Jim Corrigan#Jim Corrigan (1940s)|Jim Corrigan]].&lt;ref name="FawkesCorrigan" /&gt; He also brought back [[Ten-Eyed Man]], [[Doctor Double X]], and [[Maxie Zeus]] among various other villains and characters that have not been seen in Gotham in years,&lt;ref name="USAToday2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MTVEternal16" /&gt; and thought to introduce Julia Pennyworth, which the creative team felt so strongly about, they rerouted "everything to make [her place in the story] one of the key parts of the series."&lt;ref name="USAToday2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FawkesPennyworth" /&gt;
* Layman, before leaving the project, was to focus on "the colorful aspects of Gotham" and the villains.&lt;ref name="SnyderRama"/&gt; Layman's replacement, Kyle Higgins, will continue this focus&lt;ref name="HigginsFocus" /&gt; while also taking his approach from a cinema background. Higgins also revealed that he would introduce Zachary Gate, also known as The Architect, from his ''[[Batman: Gates of Gotham]]'' series.&lt;ref name="HigginsRama" /&gt;

Snyder stated after the release of ''Batman'' #28, that [[Bluebird (DC Comics)|Harper Row]] "is all over this book"&lt;ref name="Batman28CBR" /&gt; and later said that one of the "spines" of the series is the relationship between Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], putting "them in situations you've never ever seen before where the conflicts and challenges they're up against are different than anything they've experienced on the page." On the characters that will appear in the series, Tynion said, "Gotham is the best toy box in the comics industry, and we're getting to play with all of the toys, even the ones that are sort of in the bottom of the bin that have been forgotten about."&lt;ref name="USAToday2" /&gt;

Tynion later added that [[Dick Grayson]] would not appear in his series, due to the Bat Family believing he is dead from the events of ''[[Forever Evil]]'' and the character appearing in his new role as a superspy in the series ''Grayson''. However, the effect of the Bat Family thinking [[Nightwing]] is dead and not knowing where he is will be explored.&lt;ref name="RamaWeek2" /&gt; At the 2014 [[Chicago Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo]], Tynion revealed that the creative team almost included [[Renee Montoya]], who has yet to appear in The New 52, but they decided against it, saying, "We cut her out because we didn't want her to just be in the background of the GCPD. We want to bring her back for her own big story."&lt;ref name="C2E22014Panel" /&gt;

In the near future, Batman is seen tied to the [[Bat-Signal]] while Gotham City burns around him. In the present, Commissioner Gordon is fighting [[Professor Pyg]] before being joined by Batman. The two give chase to Pyg, with Gordon cornering one of his henchmen, ordering him to lower his weapon, though the henchman states he does not have one. Gordon fires, but the bullet passes through the henchman and hits a transformer, which causes a massive explosion and two trains to collide. The [[Gotham City Police Department]] and [[Jason Bard]], who had just arrived in Gotham, arrive at the scene and Bard arrests Gordon,&lt;ref name="Eternal 1" /&gt; who is denied bail for his crimes and assigned to [[Blackgate Penitentiary|Blackgate Prison]] until his trial.&lt;ref name="Eternal 4" /&gt; Batman reviews the footage of the accident and learns that the henchman Gordon was chasing worked for [[Carmine Falcone]], who has been talking to [[List of mayors of Gotham City|Mayor Sebastian Hady]] about returning Gotham to the time before the rise of Batman.&lt;ref name="Eternal 2" /&gt; Batman goes to the [[Iceberg Lounge]] to see if [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] knows of Falcone's whereabouts, only to find that Penguin does not know he has returned. Later at the [[Batcave]], Batman attempts to piece together the evidence gathered so far, when he learns of attacks on Penguin's weapons caches by Falcone's men. Learning of the attacks as well, Penguin prepares to go to war with Falcone. Mayor Hady, under the guidance of Falcone, promotes Major Jack Forbes to interim commissioner of the GCPD, who shifts the department's priority to stopping Batman.&lt;ref name="Eternal 3" /&gt;

As Batman deals with an explosion at Pyg's lab caused by [[Doctor Phosphorus]], [[Catwoman]] visits Penguin at the Iceberg Lounge to learn about disappearances in the Gotham Underground, before Falcone, [[Tiger Shark (DC Comics)|Tiger Shark]] and Road Runner begin an attack on the casino. Catwoman is able to save Penguin and patrons of the casino before it sinks to the bottom of Gotham Harbor, while Pyg destroys Road Runner's car dealership, believing he was connected to destroying his lab.&lt;ref name="Eternal 7" /&gt; After Batman apprehends multiple Falcone thugs throughout the night for the GCPD, Falcone contacts Forbes about putting Batman in his place. Later that night, Batman meets Forbes and Bard at the Bat–Signal, hoping to form an alliance similar to the one he had with Gordon. When Forbes threatens to shoot, Bard orders the SWAT members to fire their smoke grenades, allowing Batman to escape. To learn more about Falcone's past and why he has returned to Gotham, Batman heads to [[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref name="Eternal 8" /&gt; where is aided by the Batman of Japan. Batman learns from Shen Fang that Falcone bought Fang out to end the gang war in Hong Kong to return to Gotham. Batman returns home with Julia Pennyworth, who was injured while fighting Fang, to the surprise of Alfred. In Gotham, Catwoman is captured by Falcone when she attempts a heist.&lt;ref name="Eternal 9" /&gt; While Alfred helps nurse Julia back to health at [[Wayne Manor]], Pyg takes Falcone and Catwoman hostage, hoping to turn Falcone into one of his henchmen for blowing up his lab, though Batman is able to stop him and rescue Catwoman.&lt;ref name="Eternal 10" /&gt;

With no end to the gang war in sight, Bard approaches [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]], [[Maggie Sawyer]], [[Vicki Vale]] and Batman with an idea on how to stop it: lead an assault on Falcone's men to capture them, and with the help of Vale, wire tap Forbes to learn more about his involvement with Falcone. Elsewhere, Gordon begins his trial and learns that his son, [[James Gordon Jr.]], is alive, who gives him an opportunity to escape his captivity the next night, though Gordon does not take it.&lt;ref name="Eternal 12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eternal 13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eternal 14" /&gt; Distraught by all that Falcone has done to him, Penguin arrives at Falcone's hideout to finish him, only for both to be arrested by Bard and sent to Blackgate.&lt;ref name="Eternal 14" /&gt; Once inside Blackgate, along with many of their gang members, one of Falcone's men kills one of Penguin's, igniting a riot and takeover in the prison. Hearing this, Gordon sets out to save the guards and receives help from his cellmate Leo, who turns out to be former crime boss Rex Calabrese.&lt;ref name="Eternal 19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eternal 20" /&gt; With Bard and Batman working together now, the two witness someone head underground in the Narrows and go to investigate. They are eventually joined by [[Killer Croc]],&lt;ref name="Eternal 18" /&gt; where they encounter [[Ten-Eyed Man]] and a captured victim. Batman, Croc and Bard are able to save the victim and defeat Ten-Eyed Man, as the underground caves in on him.&lt;ref name="Eternal 19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eternal 20" /&gt;

Batgirl uses the [[Batcomputer]] to recreate the train station surveillance, where she notices a man who spent three hours on the tracks, leaving only just before the trains collided. She identifies him as a Brazilian soap opera star with drug cartel connections, and heads to South America to find him.&lt;ref name="Eternal 4" /&gt; In South America, Batgirl is confronted by [[Batmen of All Nations#Club of Villains|Scorpiana]]. With the aid of [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]], who Bruce sends to help Batgirl,&lt;ref name="Eternal 10" /&gt; [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] and [[Batmen of All Nations#Members|El Gaucho]], she is able to defeat Scorpiana and learns that the man was not actually at the train station, but an impersonator instead.&lt;ref name="Eternal 11" /&gt; Searching for the actual person, Red Hood and Batgirl are joined by Batwoman,&lt;ref name="Eternal 15" /&gt; and they eventually end up at a toy factory in Rio de Janeiro. Once inside, they find Dr. Falsario, who uses mind altering technology on Batgirl,&lt;ref name="Eternal 18" /&gt; who begins to attack Red Hood and Batwoman, seeing them as the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and James Jr., respectively. While Batwoman is able to get to Dr. Falsario and learn that he supplied his mind altering technology to have Gordon see a gun, Red Hood tells Batgirl one of his favorite memories of them to spark her eidetic memory, and break the mind control.&lt;ref name="Eternal 19" /&gt; Dr. Falsario escapes to the rain forest, where Batgirl gives chase, though he is killed by an unknown assassin before she can talk to him.&lt;ref name="Eternal 20" /&gt;

During the gang war, Stephanie Brown returns home to see [[Cluemaster|her father]] meeting with other villains, narrowly escaping when her dad attempts to kill her for being a possible deterrent to his boss and his associates' rising to power in Gotham.&lt;ref name="Eternal 3" /&gt; Stephanie calls her mother to tell her what she has learned, only for her mother to reach out to her father after hanging up with her.&lt;ref name="Eternal 4" /&gt; Stephanie heads to the library, where she begins to post articles alerting the public to her father and his comrades' villainous deeds,&lt;ref name="Eternal 10" /&gt; and also researches the history of her father and how he became Cluemaster.&lt;ref name="Eternal 11" /&gt; To draw her out, Cluemaster sends a bomb to one of Stephanie Brown's friend's house, setting it ablaze.&lt;ref name="Eternal 13" /&gt; She creates the Spoiler costume to go after her father and other bad guys.&lt;ref name="Eternal 20" /&gt;

[[Tim Drake|Red Robin]] investigates the infected children who were present during Pyg's fight with Gordon, and learns the infection originated from a single building in the Narrows. Red Robin goes to the Narrows and discovers the infection was caused by nanobots, and accidentally activates them in a child. Elsewhere, Vicki Vale follows a lead on potential gang wars in the Narrows, and, upon confronting them, is saved by Harper Row. The gang members follow Harper and Vale back to Harper's apartment, which is below Red Robin, who falls through the floor fighting the nanobots. The nanobots attack the gang members before Red Robin is able to stop them. However, Harper's brother Cullen, who was also infected, has the nanobots enter his body. In Tokyo, one of Bruce's teachers, Sergei, comments that the nanobots were activated too early, and that Bruce would not be happy.&lt;ref name="Eternal 5" /&gt; Red Robin heads to Tokyo to find Sergei, only to learn that Harper has stowed away on his plane.&lt;ref name="Eternal 14" /&gt; The duo find Sergei and Red Robin shows him the nanobot design, which Sergei says resembles a design that was stolen from him.&lt;ref name="Eternal 17" /&gt; Red Robin also begins to consider training Harper.&lt;ref name="Eternal 19" /&gt;

Batman sends [[Batwing (DC Comics)|Batwing]] to assist [[Jim Corrigan#Jim Corrigan (1940s)|Jim Corrigan]] at [[Arkham Asylum]] to investigate a magical disturbance, while [[Duela Dent#The New 52|Joker's Daughter]] prepares a summoning ritual below Arkham, using its inmates that have the "dark dream".&lt;ref name="Eternal 6" /&gt; Corrigan and Batwing enter Arkham only to be attacked,&lt;ref name="Eternal 15" /&gt; with Batwing captured by Joker's Daughter. Batwing is able to escape and meets back up with Corrigan to discover that a resurrected [[Deacon Blackfire]] is the cause of the Arkham disturbance,&lt;ref name="Eternal 16" /&gt; who is able to unleash his attack on Gotham.&lt;ref name="Eternal 17" /&gt;

Bard becomes the new police commissioner, when word is released that Gordon is receiving a life sentence for his murders. Bard arranges Falcone to be released from Blackgate, but Batman meets with him first. He tells Falcone he knew he framed Gordon, as he has since learned from Batgirl, Red Hood and Batwoman, that the knife that killed Dr. Falsario belongs to the crime lords of Hong Kong, only for Falcone to say that Batman has no idea who is actually behind everything. Later, Batman gives Bard evidence that can clear Gordon, and tells Bard he does not trust him. At Wayne Manor [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] injects Alfred with fear toxin, while Bard goes to Blackgate to retrieve Falcone and release Zachary Gate, giving him his Architect costume. Bard contacts Hush telling him he released the Architect and that Batman does not suspect anything, along with destroying the evidence clearing Gordon.&lt;ref name="Eternal 21" /&gt; Batman heads to the Beacon Tower when he sees the Architect destroying it. Julia Pennyworth enters the Batcave and contacts Batman, telling him about Alfred's condition and assists him in rescuing the hostages held in the Beacon Tower. Batman confronts the Architect, who helps him realize that Hush has been one of the masterminds since the beginning.&lt;ref name="Eternal 22" /&gt;

Hush has been manipulating the city, both overtly, through the gang war between Carmine Falcone and the Penguin and the Architect's attack on Beacon Tower; and covertly, using the Cluemaster to trigger rolling blackouts, infesting the city with rats and strangling the road network with traffic jams. All of this brings tensions to a head so that when Hush has Jason Bard leak a story about an imminent terrorist attack to the ''Gotham Gazette'', rioting breaks out, forcing Bard to introduce a state of martial law.

With the help of Jade, a girl living on the streets under the protection of Killer Croc, Selina Kyle enters Blackgate Prison to meet with her father, Rex Calabrese. Calabrese suggests that she alone can end the gang war by showing herself to be his daughter, but Selina refuses. When Jade is taken by child services and placed with her only living relatives, a group of Romanian mobsters, Selina makes it her mission to rescue her. The Romanians use Jade to lure her into a trap, capturing her and intending to beat and torture her to death in front of a paying crowd. Selina escapes when Killer Croc arrives, looking for Jade, but is horrified when a bullet aimed at her kills Jade instead. She returns to Calabrese who repeats his suggestion that Selina could end the gang war, and she takes up the cause.

Meanwhile, Hush&amp;mdash;as Thomas Elliott&amp;mdash;has Alfred moved to Arkham Asylum, which remains under the control of the inmates. Although Deacon Blackfire's plan to open Gotham up to the influence of hell has been thwarted, he still retains corporeal form and is able to overpower Jim Corrigan. Having been separated previously, Batwing reawakens and tries to rescue Corrigan, only to witness the Spectre emerging and stopping Blackfire. However, this causes the caves under Arkham Asylum to collapse, destroying the facility and allowing a mass break-out of the inmates. Alfred is among the survivors and joins with Bane in trying to locate other survivors. Alfred leads him to a satellite Batcave and uses its defence systems to knock him out.

While Batman tries to track down the Arkham escapees, Hush has Jason Bard deploy soldiers to specific locations around the city. While on a routine patrol, an explosion destroys a police convoy, killing several police officers. The explosion is revealed to have been a Wayne Enterprises weapons cache, one of seventeen placed around the city to assist Batman Incorporated. Batman joins Julia Pennyworth in rendering each cache safe by activating its failsafe, destroying its contents. He finally confronts Hush in the final cache, and the two fight. Although Batman prevails, Hush directs his attention to a news broadcast in which Lucius Fox announces that in light of the explosion, the federal government has seized upon Wayne Enterprises' assets, effectively rendering Bruce Wayne bankrupt.

With Hush in custody, order is temporarily restored until Jason Bard tries to capture Batman with seized Wayne Enterprises assets, leading Batman to believe that Hush was simply another pawn in a wider scheme. He starts searching for the mastermind, first tracking down the Riddler and later Ra's al Ghul&amp;mdash;the only people he believes who have the ability carry out such a sophisticated plan&amp;mdash;only for both of them to convince him of their innocence, arguing that they could easily destroy a weakened Batman, but that they must vanquish him at the height of his powers in order to prove their power over him.

Meanwhile, Red Robin enlists Harper Row's aid in locating the source of the nanomachine infestation sweeping the city. They identify Jervis Tetch as the source, and Harper&amp;mdash;adopting the name "Bluebird"&amp;mdash;is forced into the field when Red Robin, Batgirl and Red Hood are all overwhelmed by the nanomachines. Harper tricks Tetch into giving up the device that controls the nanomachines, shutting down the infestation. They realise that a variant of Tetch's mind-control technology was used to manipulate Jim Gordon into firing the shots that triggered the subway accident.

Following the collapse of Arkham Asylum, several high-value inmates remain at large. After regrouping and arguing over their leadership, they find an anonymous backer has supplied them with unlimited resources, enabling them to unleash havoc on the city at will. Selina Kyle is made the same offer, but turns it down and instead focuses on finding Stephanie Brown, who is still on the run from assassins. Selina locates her quickly and turns her over to Batman. Stephanie refuses to talk, believing that Bruce Wayne is responsible for backing the criminal activity that has taken hold in Gotham. As each of Batman's allies heads off to thwart the individual criminals, the Penguin starts a riot at Blackgate Penitentiary to try and kill James Gordon. Gordon is saved by Harvey Bullock and Jason Bard, who has had a change of heart. They escape the prison to find Gotham of fire following an attack by Firefly.

Batman initially prepares to engage Firefly, but realises that it is a distraction. He moves to Beacon Tower where he is confronted by the real mastermind of the plan: Arthur Brown, also known as the Cluemaster, a costumed villain largely regarded as a third-rate criminal. Brown reveals that his entire plan hinged on Batman believing his own legend&amp;mdash;that if his enemies appeared to not only be co-ordinated, but orchestrated, then he would always look for the bigger threat behind it all and never consider a small-time criminal like Brown as the mastermind. Brown prepares to kill Batman, but is himself killed by his silent partner, Lincoln March; also known as the Talon. On the Night of the Owls, Brown approached the Court of Owls with his plan to ruin Batman, only to find that they have been slaughtered by March, who agrees to support his plan.

As March and a physically and mentally exhausted Batman begin to fight, Jim Gordon rallies the people of Gotham to rise up and support him. The entire Batman family converges on Beacon Tower to apprehend March before he can kill Batman, but he escapes through the sewers. In the aftermath, Jason Bard resigns as commissioner with his career in ruins, while Stephanie Brown moves in with Harper Row and her brother Cullen. Red Robin questions March's whereabouts, and it is revealed that although he killed the Court of Owls' leadership, the membership continued on, catching him and putting him into an induced hypothermic coma indefinitely. In the epilogue, Batman meets with Jim Gordon, who reveals that Scarecrow has launched another attack on the city. Batman asks if he is ready for one more fight; Gordon replies that he is willing to find out.

==Reception==
{{As of|2014|12|05|df=US}}, [[Review aggregator|review aggregate]] website Comic Book Roundup reported a 7.3/10 rating for the series, based on individual reviews for each issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/reviews/dc-comics/batman-eternal|title=Batman: Eternal Review|publisher=Comic Book Roundup|accessdate=August 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903073859/http://www.comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/reviews/dc-comics/batman-eternal|archive-date=2014-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, ''Batman Eternal'', along with DC's second weekly title launching in 2014, ''[[The New 52: Futures End]]'', were featured on [[IGN]]'s "Most Anticipated Comics of 2014".&lt;ref name="IGNMostAnticipated" /&gt;

The first issue received positive reviews. [[Comic Book Resources]]' Jim Johnson gave the issue 4.5 stars out of 5, saying the issue "is a tremendous start, not just for a weekly series, but for any comic series."&lt;ref name="Eternal1CBR" /&gt; Michael Moccio of [[Newsarama]] added, "From beginning to end of this issue, you won’t want to stop turning the pages and, at the final page, you’ll be on the edge of your seat anticipating the next issue", giving it an 8 out of 10.&lt;ref name="Eternal1Rama" /&gt; Despite some "clunky dialogue" at the start of ''Batman Eternal'' #1, Mike Logsdon of IGN gave the issue an 8.6 out of 10, due to its "cinematically-scaled layouts, strong themes, an interesting use of a new character, and an intriguing new mystery."&lt;ref name="Eternal1IGN" /&gt;

John Layman's first issue in the series, ''Batman Eternal'' #4, was met with generally positive reviews. Logsdon gave the issue a 9.0 out of 10, saying, beyond a few art distractions, it was "the strongest issue of this series so far."&lt;ref name="Eternal4IGN" /&gt; Newsarama's Pierce Lydon added that, despite "another solid installation in this weekly series... the plot is starting to spin its wheels. We are less than 10% through this series, but we’re not seeing enough effective payoff yet. The World’s Greatest Detective is really taking his time doing any detecting", giving the issue a 6 out of 10.&lt;ref name="Eternal4Rama" /&gt; Jennifer Cheng of Comic Book Resources said the issue felt "like a well put-together TV show, and not just in its faster week-to-week pacing. There are many interlocking parts to the plot, and each part holds its own," awarding the issue 3.5 stars out of 5.&lt;ref name="Eternal4CBR" /&gt;

Issue 5, James Tynion IV's first issue, continued the generally positive trend, receiving 4 stars out of 5 from Comic Book Resources's Greg McElhatton. He said, "A weekly series needs to have three to four times as much plot as a monthly book, in order to keep from feeling padded. With this issue, we're starting to enter the outskirts of "epic" levels of plot, and that's a relief. Tynion takes on the scripting for this issue and it flows well, introducing the new elements without feeling like we've been left hanging for what's come before."&lt;ref name="Eternal5CBR" /&gt; Logsdon gave the issue a 7.8 out of 10, saying "It seems that this weekly series might be presenting us with a series of one-shots that tie into the larger story. If this really is the start of a trend, so far it has been quite successful. James Tynion IV takes on scripting duties and he does a good job of capturing Tim Drake's new personality."&lt;ref name="Eternal5IGN" /&gt; Lydon, however, said, "I’m always partial stories that take into account more than just the police and capes side of a story and Tynion taps Vicki Vale for a starring role as well. But we’re still just moving pawns in this game of chess, and the strategy has been yet to be fully realized," giving the issue a 5 out of 10.&lt;ref name="Eternal5Rama" /&gt;

''Batman Eternal'' #6, the first for Ray Fawkes, had more mixed reviews. IGN's Jeff Lake said the series "is starting to feel a bit like ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. Each week offers a snapshot view of a few characters, only to switch to a different set the following week. Issue #6 is a Batwing issue, and while it's fun to see him working alongside Jim Corrigan (and facing the always awesome [[Gentleman Ghost]]), it's hard to see how it fits into the main story," awarding the issue a 7.8 out of 10.&lt;ref name="Eternal6IGN" /&gt; Lydon expressed similar sentiments, giving the issue a 6 out of 10 and adding, "We’re still firmly in building mode but we’re starting to lose sight of the inciting incident. Gordon’s mishap and the return of the Roman feel like they happened so long ago because we’ve seen an attempt to weave so many other storylines in."&lt;ref name="Eternal6Rama" /&gt;

Logsdon gave issue 7, Tim Seeley's first, an 8.0 out of 10, feeling Seeley gave each of the characters he dealt with the proper spotlight.&lt;ref name="Eternal7IGN" /&gt; Marykate Jasper of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, saying the issue was "an explosion-packed, game-changing issue that keeps up the pace of its predecessors and continues to expand the scope of the story."&lt;ref name="Eternal7CBR" /&gt; Lydon also spoke positively, giving the issue an 8 out of 10, and saying, "The chains are really starting to move in ''Eternal''... [and the series] is changing the landscape of Gotham quite literally, and it’s exciting to watch."&lt;ref name="Eternal7Rama" /&gt;

Issue 22, Kyle Higgins' first issue, received a 5 out of 10 from Lydon. He said, "Kyle Higgins’ scripting serves really only to get us to the ending and have the Architect reveal his motivations a bit... This chapter almost feels extraneous, but it’s not the worst this title has been."&lt;ref name="Eternal22Rama" /&gt; McElhatton gave the issue 2.5 stars out of 5, saying, "The problem with ''Batman Eternal'' #22 is that this recent shift, bringing the Architect and Hush back into continuity, hasn't had time to settle in with everything else around it. Dealing with the crime war or the strangeness under Arkham Asylum, bringing the characters in feels out of place, almost like an entirely different comic. While the connection is there, it's still such a thin line that for the moment it's hard to adjust to a proverbial jumping of the tracks into something else. The tone is different, the characters we've been reading about are suddenly all absent, and this just doesn't quite work."&lt;ref name="Eternal22CBR" /&gt;

;''Batman'' #28
[[Comic Book Resources]]' Doug Zawisza gave ''Batman'' #28 4.5 stars out of 5, saying he was "onboard and locked in to see how Snyder and crew weave the not-so-distant past with the near future... [and the] issue is a nice break from "Zero Year," a change of pace, a switch in visual impact, a breath of fresh air and a sign of hope for the Gotham of tomorrow as Snyder continues to construct and deepen the legend of Gotham City and its role in the mythology of Batman."&lt;ref name="Batman28CBRReview" /&gt; David Pepose of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out 10. He said, "With this preview to the upcoming Bat-event ''Batman Eternal'', the creative team adds just enough to Gotham's mythology to hold your interest."&lt;ref name="Batman28RamaReview" /&gt; IGN's Melissa Grey gave the issue an 8 out of 10 as well, calling it "a fun issue," but one that "doesn't comfortably ground the reader in its timeline."&lt;ref name="Batman28IGNReview" /&gt;

==Sales==
For April 2014, [[Diamond Comic Distributors]] announced that ''Batman Eternal'' issues 1–4 were the fourth, sixth, ninth and 10th best selling titles of the month, respectively.&lt;ref name="April2014Sales" /&gt; ''Batman Eternal'' #5–8 ranked 10th, 11th, 17th and 15th, respectively for May 2014.&lt;ref name="May2014Sales" /&gt; In June 2014, ''Batman Eternal'' #9-12 ranked 14th through 17th, respectively.&lt;ref name="June2014Sales" /&gt; For July 2014, ''Eternal'' #13-17 ranked 17th, 18th, 22nd, 23rd and 25th, respectively.&lt;ref name="July2014Sales" /&gt; ''Eternal'' #18 in August 2014 ranked 10th, while issues 19-21 ranked 14th-16th, respectively.&lt;ref name="August2014Sales" /&gt; In September 2014, ''Batman Eternal'' #22-25 ranked 31st, 34th, 35th and 37th, respectively.&lt;ref name="September2014Sales" /&gt; In October 2014, issues #26-30 ranked 29th, 32nd, 39th and 38th, respectively.&lt;ref name="October2014Sales" /&gt; The final issue, #52, reached the rank of 39th.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2015/2015-04.html | title=April 2015 Sales | work=Comichron }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, DC announced a new title within the "Batman" family of New 52 titles, ''Arkham Manor'', written by Gerry Duggan, with art by Shawn Crystal for release in October 2014.&lt;ref name="ArkhamManor" /&gt; In August, they also announced ''Gotham By Midnight'' for release in November 2014, written by Ray Fawkes and art by Ben Templesmith.&lt;ref name="Midnight" /&gt; Both spin out of the events of ''Eternal'', with ''Arkham Manor'' focusing on Wayne Manor becoming the new Arkham Asylum,&lt;ref name="ArkhamManor2" /&gt; and ''Gotham By Midnight'' exploring Corrigan and "The Midnight Shift" of the Gotham Police Department that handle supernatural occurrences.&lt;ref name="Midnight" /&gt; ''Arkham Manor'' takes place after the events of ''Eternal'' #30,&lt;ref name="ArkhamManor3" /&gt; with ''Gotham By Midnight'' occurring at the end of the ''Eternal'' storyline ending in March 2015.&lt;ref name="BatTitlesEternalEnd" /&gt;

==Sequel==
At the 2015 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], DC announced a follow up series, ''[[Batman and Robin Eternal]]''. It will feature Tynion as the lead writer, along with Snyder, Seeley, Geneveive Valentine, Steve Orlando, Jackson Lanzing, Collin Kelly and Ed BrissonIt, with art from Tony Daniel, Paul Pelletier and Scot Eaton. ''Batman and Robin Eternal'' will begin in October 2015 until April 2016, running weekly for 26 issues, and is intended to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Robin character, just as ''Batman Eternal'' celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Batman character. Tynion stated, "Part of it will be Dick Grayson as Robin in the past alongside Batman. This is Dick's first international mysteries, he thought it was the most harrowing case of his life but he didn't know who he was up against. He's going to stumble into a mystery that shakes the foundation of the concept of Robin. This is the series where we will bring back Cassandra Cain to the DC Universe. She's been one of my favorite characters, I came up in the era when she was front and center. Bringing her into continuity in this story in particular -- the three leads in this story are Dick Grayson and Harper Row and Cassandra Cain. It's going to take us all over the world and bring in all of the Robins. The whole Bat family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arrant|first=Chris|title=BATMAN &amp; ROBIN ETERNAL and ROBIN WAR Announced|url=http://www.newsarama.com/25123-batman-robin-eternal-and-robin-war-announced.html|publisher=Newsarama|date=July 10, 2015|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sdcc-dcs-upstarts-talk-black-canary-midnighter-more|title=SDCC: DC'S UPSTARTS TALK "BLACK CANARY," "MIDNIGHTER" &amp; MORE|last=White|first=Brett|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=July 14, 2015|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Captain Marvel''''' is an upcoming American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Carol Danvers|Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel]]. Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the twenty-first film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is written and directed by [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]], with [[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] and [[Jac Schaeffer]] also contributing to the screenplay. [[Brie Larson]] stars in the title role, alongside [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], [[Lashana Lynch]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Clark Gregg]], and [[Jude Law]]. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as Earth is caught in the center of an intergalactic conflict between two alien worlds.

Development of the film began as early as May 2013, and was officially announced in October 2014, making it Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. [[Nicole Perlman]] and [[Meg LeFauve]] were hired as a writing team the following April after submitting separate takes on the character. The story borrows elements from [[Roy Thomas]]' 1971 "[[Kree–Skrull War]]" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]. Boden and Fleck were brought on board to direct in April 2017, and Robertson-Dworet soon took over scripting duties, with the remainder of the cast added by the start of filming. [[Location shooting]] began in January 2018, with [[principal photography]] beginning that March in California before concluding in July 2018 in Louisiana. Jackson and Gregg, both reprising their roles from previous MCU films, were digitally [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] in [[post-production]].

''Captain Marvel'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 8, 2019, in [[IMAX]] and [[3D film|3D]].

==Premise==
Set in 1995,&lt;ref name="MarvelJapan" /&gt; ''Captain Marvel'' follows [[Carol Danvers]], a former [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] fighter pilot, as she turns into one of the galaxy's mightiest heroes and joins [[Starforce]], an elite [[Kree]] military team, before returning home with new questions about her past and identity when the Earth is caught in the center of an intergalactic conflict between two alien worlds.&lt;ref name="FullCastAnnouncement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EWCoverLarson" /&gt;

==Cast==
&lt;!-- Order per billing block --&gt;
* [[Brie Larson]] as [[Carol Danvers|Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel]]: {{Cast list break|An ex-[[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] fighter pilot and member of an elite [[Kree]] military team called [[Starforce]], whose DNA was fused with that of a Kree during an accident, which imbued her with superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight.&lt;ref name="Larson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LarsonConfirm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EWCoverLarson" /&gt; &lt;!-- While with Starforce, Danvers is known as "Vers".&lt;ref name="VersName" /&gt; --&gt; Danvers also has a cat named Goose, in reference to the ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986) character Nick "Goose" Bradshaw. In the comics, Goose is a flerken named Chewie, named after the ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Chewbacca]].&lt;ref name="GooseTheCat" /&gt; Larson described Danvers as a "believer in truth and justice" and a "bridge between Earth and space. She's fighting between the flaws that are within her and all this good that she wants to try and spread and make the world a better place."&lt;ref name="LarsonSciFiNow" /&gt; [[Marvel Studios]] President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that Larson was cast because she has the ability to balance the character's vast powers with her humanity and relatable flaws.&lt;ref name="FeigeNov2016" /&gt; Larson called Danvers aggressive, quick tempered, and invasive, but said while those characteristics can be great in battle, they are also character flaws.&lt;ref name="EWCover" /&gt;  Speaking more to Danvers' flaws and her Kree and human halves "warring against each other", Larson noted that her Kree half is "unemotional... an amazing fighter and competitive," while her human half "is flawed but is also the thing that she ends up leading by. It’s the thing that gets her in trouble, but it’s also the thing that makes her great."&lt;ref name="EWCoverLarson" /&gt; Regarding concern that Larson (who was 26 when she was cast) was too young to portray Danvers, an accomplished [[airman]], initial screenwriter [[Nicole Perlman]] consulted with the Air Force, who said it was not out of the realm of possibility for someone "to go very far" between the ages of 28 and 34.&lt;ref name="PerlmanPodcast" /&gt; Larson trained for nine months, learning [[judo]], [[boxing]], and [[wrestling]].&lt;ref name="LarsonTraining" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EWCoverLarson" /&gt; She also visited [[Nellis Air Force Base]] and met with active duty airmen, including [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Jeannie Leavitt]] and [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds|Thunderbirds]] pilot [[Major (United States)|Major]] Stephen Del Bagno to prepare for the role.&lt;ref name="FullCastAnnouncement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DelBagnoConsultant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LarsonNellis" /&gt; [[Mckenna Grace]] portrays a young Carol Danvers,&lt;ref name="FullCastAnnouncement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MckennaGraceRole" /&gt;}}
* [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as [[Nick Fury]]: {{Cast list break|The future director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who at this time is a low level bureaucrat.&lt;ref name="EWGreggSept2018" /&gt; Fury appears without his signature eye patch as the film is set in the 1990s, before he loses his eye.&lt;ref name="2017SDCC" /&gt; Feige stated that the film explores a period of Fury's life when he has no idea about superheroes and that Carol Danvers is the first superhero that he comes across,&lt;ref name="FeigeMar2018" /&gt; elaborating that Fury "has reached a point in his career where he thought the [[Cold War]] is over and the best days are behind him. And when he encounters certain things in this movie, it sets him on a path that leads us to where we are 19 films later."&lt;ref name="FeigeApr2018" /&gt; Jackson said, "This is a mind-changing, attitude-changing moment... He [now] understands that there are these other things out there. He understands that they're not all enemies, and we do need to find allies who have specific kinds of skills that humans don't have." Jackson described Fury at this point in time as a desk jockey, who has not yet become cynical towards bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="EWJackson" /&gt; Jackson was digitally de-aged by 25 years, the first time Marvel has done this for an entire film.&lt;ref name="Feige/FilmJul2018" /&gt;}}
* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as [[Talos (comics)|Talos]]: {{Cast list break|The shape-shifting leader of the [[Skrull]] invasion of Earth, who is working undercover within S.H.I.E.L.D. as Fury's boss.&lt;ref name="EWMendelsohn" /&gt; Mendelsohn described Talos’ human persona as "buttoned up" and his natural Skrull persona as "more laid back, a bit tougher, [and] a little bit nastier." Mendelsohn elaborated, "The thing is, when you’re Skrullin’, there’s a kind of take-no-prisoners vibe about it, which is more relaxed. [As a human] This guy’s got to follow protocol because it’s S.H.I.E.L.D." When portraying Talos, Mendelsohn uses his native Australian accent, and an American accent when he is in his S.H.I.E.L.D. disguise, which Mendelsohn compared to that of American politician [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. Mendelsohn noted there was "a very lengthy discussion" regarding the accent for the Skrulls, adding "There’s a certain kind of earthy correctness to an Australian delivery". It took Mendelson a "couple of hours" to have his makeup and prosthetics applied to portray Talos.&lt;ref name="EWMendelsohn" /&gt;}}

Lynch described Rambeau as "resilient" and "strong" saying, "Maria’s got a strength that’s undeniable, in that you don’t feel like you need to help her. She is thrown into many a situation in this movie that she’s never been a part of, never seen, never experienced — and she just learns it, immediately." Like Larson, Lynch met with active duty airmen in preparation for the role. In particular, she met with pilots who are also mothers, as her character is also both. Lynch was excited to portray a character the audience would be proud of and could relate to, especially mothers and members of the black community, helping to continue "a real through-line" for African-American characters in the MCU after ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.&lt;ref name="EWLynch" /&gt;}}

Law also stated that his character has a special relationship with Danvers, whom he views as a mentee, which becomes a source of tension in the film with the other members of Starforce.

===Development===
By May 2013, a script for ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'', the moniker [[Carol Danvers]] used in the comics before she took the mantle [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], had been written for [[Marvel Studios]] through the studio's writing program.&lt;ref name="THRMay2013" /&gt; Producer Louis D'Esposito stated later that year that the studio was interested in a female-driven superhero film, saying that they have plenty of "strong female characters" from which to choose and suggested Captain Marvel, [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Pepper Potts]], or [[Peggy Carter]] as possible candidates.&lt;ref name="ComingSoonSep2013" /&gt; [[Kevin Feige]], President of Production at Marvel Studios, said that if Marvel was to make a female-led film, he would prefer it to be a new character to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] like Captain Marvel, who could receive an [[origin story]].&lt;ref name="BadassDigestMarch2014" /&gt; In August 2014, Feige stated that [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and Captain Marvel were "both characters that we like, that development work has been done on and is continuing to be done on" and that the studio is often asked about it by the public, "more than ''Iron Man 4'', more than ''[[Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers 3]]'' ... I think that's something that we have to pay attention to."&lt;ref name="IGNAug2014" /&gt;

{{quote box|width=33%|quote=We've been talking a lot about archetypes and what we want this movie to be about and just how to write a strong female superhero without making it [[Superman]] with boobs ... we'll catch ourselves and say, 'Wait a minute, what are we saying [here] about women in power?' Then we have to say, 'Why are we getting so hung up on that? We should just tell the best story and build the best character.' And then we have this constant back-and-forth about how to tell a story that is compelling, entertaining, moving, kick-ass, and fun, and also be aware of what those larger implications might be.|source= —Co-screenwriter [[Nicole Perlman]]&lt;ref name="PerlmanJuly2015" /&gt;}}

In October 2014, Feige announced that ''Captain Marvel'' would be released on July 6, 2018, as part of the studio's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Three|Phase Three]] slate of films,&lt;ref name="MarvelOct2014" /&gt; making it Marvel's first female-led film.&lt;ref name="Seventeen" /&gt; He said the film would be based on the Carol Danvers version of the character and that the film "has been in the works almost as long as ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' or ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' before it came out, and one of the key things was figuring out what we wanted to do with it. Her adventures are very earthbound, but her powers are based in the cosmic realm."&lt;ref name="MarvelOct2014" /&gt; Feige added that a writer and director would be announced "quite soon", and female filmmakers were being considered, though he could not promise that Marvel would "hire from any one demographic".&lt;ref name="Oct2014EventQA" /&gt;

In February 2015, Marvel pushed back the release date to November 2, 2018.&lt;ref name="Feb2015Dates" /&gt; In early April, Feige revealed that Captain Marvel appeared in an early draft of the ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' screenplay, but was removed as "it didn't feel like the time. We didn't want to introduce her fully formed flying in a costume before you knew who she was or how she came to be."&lt;ref name="AvengersAoU" /&gt; He also said that Marvel would be ready to announce writers for the film "hopefully in the next week or two",&lt;ref name="FeigeApril2015" /&gt; and by mid-April, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' co-screenwriter [[Nicole Perlman]] and ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' co-screenwriter [[Meg LeFauve]] were announced to be writing the screenplay.&lt;ref name="WritersOfficial" /&gt; The duo were put together as a writing team after impressing Feige with separate takes on the character,&lt;ref name="Writers" /&gt; and began work on the film within a month.&lt;ref name="ScreenwritersBegin" /&gt; LeFauve found the character being a female superhero to be both "wonderful" and a challenge, particularly because of how powerful the character is which could lead to the "Superman curse. 'What's her vulnerability?' is what we have to figure out."&lt;ref name="LeFauveOct2015" /&gt;

By May, Marvel had discussions with [[Ava DuVernay]] about directing ''Captain Marvel'' or ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'',&lt;ref name="DuVernay" /&gt; which Feige confirmed a month later, saying that he had met with DuVernay amongst a number of other directors and expected a decision to be made by mid- to late 2015.&lt;ref name="FeigeJune2015" /&gt; That September, Feige said that the casting process would not begin until 2016, as "we're scripting the film, figuring out who we want Carol Danvers to be, and really what the structure of the movie will be and what her part will be in some of our other Phase 3 films." Producer Jeremy Latcham elaborated that "getting the character right first is going to lead the charge. We want to make sure we know who it is before we can start figuring out who should play it."&lt;ref name="FeigeSept2015" /&gt; In October 2015, Marvel changed the release date once again, moving it back to March 8, 2019.&lt;ref name="Phase3Update" /&gt;

[[File:Brie Larson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Brie Larson]] promoting ''Captain Marvel'' at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]
Feige stated in April 2016 that a director would be announced "in the next month or two" and that the first cast members would be announced in mid-2016. He also mentioned that the film would be about Carol Danvers' journey to become Captain Marvel.&lt;ref name="FeigeApr2016" /&gt; The next month, indie filmmaker [[Emily Carmichael (filmmaker)|Emily Carmichael]]'s name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film,&lt;ref name="Carmichael" /&gt; and by June, [[Brie Larson]] emerged as the frontrunner to play Captain Marvel.&lt;ref name="Larson2" /&gt; Larson was confirmed for the role at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] 2016,&lt;ref name="LarsonConfirm" /&gt; for which she will earn $5 million.&lt;ref name="LarsonPay" /&gt; Larson was initially hesitant to accept the role, but "couldn't deny the fact that this movie is everything I care about, everything that's progressive and important and meaningful, and a symbol I wished I would've had growing up."&lt;ref name="LarsonVanityFair" /&gt; She was able to bring "some of those [deep emotional] things" she had used in more "dramatic roles" for the part, which she felt helped set ''Captain Marvel'' apart from other superhero films.&lt;ref name="EWCoverLarson" /&gt; Also at Comic-Con, Feige said the search for a director had been narrowed down to "a short list of 10", and was hoping to be able to announce the choice "by the end of the summer".&lt;ref name="FeigeSDCC2016" /&gt;

Perlman revealed in August that the character's origin story had been changed for the film due to similarities with [[Green Lantern]]'s,&lt;ref name="PerlmanAug2016" /&gt; with Feige expanding by saying, "I think we have a very cool and unique way of telling" her story, centered on Danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities; he added that the character would be "by far the most powerful character" in the MCU films, and would be a "very important character in our universe".&lt;ref name="FeigeOct2016" /&gt; Producer Nate Moore later explained that they sought to break away from the traditional structure of many MCU origin stories, "which is you meet the character, they have a problem, they get powers at the end of the first act, and the end of the second act they learn about the powers, the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers," in order to give audiences a new experience;&lt;ref name="MooreMay2018" /&gt; Danvers starts the films with her powers already.&lt;ref name="EWCover" /&gt;

In October 2016, Feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected, and explained that the studio was now waiting for "a little more of the story [to be] set" so they could talk to potential directors about it. Once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film, Feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement "to make a great version of ''Captain Marvel'', but it's something we think is important," even if that female filmmaker does not know a lot about the comics, as "they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it. It's amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through [the source material] and know, 'Oh, a female's writing it now'", speaking in particular to [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]]'s run in the comics.&lt;ref name="FeigeOct2016" /&gt; Feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016;&lt;ref name="FeigeDirectorEnd2016" /&gt; however, Perlman and LeFauve turned in a script treatment around December, pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017.&lt;ref name="ScriptDirectorUpdate" /&gt;

In February 2017, Perlman stated that despite her and LeFauve being hired almost a year previously, the duo had only recently gotten their "marching orders" for the script, stating one of the reasons for the delay was figuring out where the film would fit within the MCU. Perlman also discussed the character's femininity, feeling that it was important to make sure she is not "somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity ... being a woman is part of [her] strength." The writers were also considerate of tropes that could be diminishing to a female character but not for male characters, "things you wouldn't think twice about for [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] but you would think twice about for Captain Marvel."&lt;ref name="PerlmanPodcast" /&gt;&lt;!-- Additionally, Malaysian actress Raja Ilya was cast in an undisclosed role.&lt;ref name="IlyaCast" /&gt; --&gt;

{{quote box|width=33%|quote=This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly or has some godlike connection... what makes her special is just how human she is.

But at her core, she has so much heart and so much humanity — and all of its messiness.|source= —Co-director [[Anna Boden]]&lt;ref name="EWCover" /&gt;}}

Marvel hired [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]] to direct ''Captain Marvel'' in April 2017, after the duo impressed Marvel "time and time again" over numerous meetings with their vision for the character, and because of their experience working in both television and film.&lt;ref name="Directors" /&gt; Feige noted that he and Marvel were impressed with Boden and Fleck's ability to create character-driven stories in all of their works. He added, "The stories they've told have been so diverse, but regardless of the subject matter, they can dive into it and hone in on that character's journey." Ultimately, Feige felt the film "needs to be about the three-dimensional, multilayered Carol Danvers character. You have to be able to track her and follow her and relate to her at all points of the movie, regardless of how many visual effects and spaceships and bad guys are filling the frame."&lt;ref name="FeigeVultureApr2017" /&gt; Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2018, at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],&lt;ref name="FilmingLocation" /&gt; but Feige was expecting it to not begin until February 2018.&lt;ref name="FebFilmingStart" /&gt;

By July 2017, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as [[Nick Fury]].&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige revealed that the film would take place in the 1990s and the [[Skrulls]] would act as the film's villains, allowing elements from the "[[Kree–Skrull War]]" storyline to appear.&lt;ref name="2017SDCC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kree–Skrull War" /&gt; By setting the film in the 1990s, Feige noted it would allow Danvers to "be the singular hero, but place it within timing of the MCU."&lt;ref name="FeigeMar2018" /&gt; In response to this announcement, Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' compared the film to ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' and the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'', as they were also set decades before present day. By setting the film in the 1990s, McMillan felt it would create the question of "what happened to Captain Marvel to take her off the playing field ahead of the Marvel movies that we've seen to date?", and noted Danvers' story might echo the "Captain America narrative", where "a hero from the past... disappears from the world before re-emerging".&lt;ref name="THRComparison" /&gt; Also in July, the [[California Film Commission]] awarded a $20.7{{nbsp}}million tax credit to the production,&lt;ref name="CaliforniaTaxCredit" /&gt; going towards the first $100{{nbsp}}million spent on qualified in-state expenditures,&lt;ref name="CaliforniaTaxCredit2" /&gt; making California the main filming location for ''Captain Marvel''. D'Esposito called this "very exciting" given Marvel Studios' headquarters and post-production facilities are also in the state, allowing them to streamline the production process for this film and others.&lt;ref name="CaliforniaTaxCredit" /&gt; Awarding of the tax credit was dependent on filming beginning within 180 days.&lt;ref name="CaliforniaTaxCreditPDF" /&gt; Marvel planned to spend $118.6&amp;nbsp;million filming in the state, for a net of $97.8&amp;nbsp;million after the tax credit was applied.&lt;ref name="CFCBudget" /&gt;

[[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] was hired by Marvel by mid-August to take over the scripting duties for ''Captain Marvel'' after LeFauve left the project to co-direct ''[[Gigantic (2020 film)|Gigantic]]'' for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Animation]].&lt;ref name="Robertson-Dworet" /&gt; Perlman confirmed her departure from the project as well, and said that the story she and LeFauve worked on in earlier drafts would be retained in the final screenplay.&lt;ref name="PerlmanAugust2017" /&gt; Robertson-Dworet described the film as an action-comedy, and likened her script to an initial one she wrote for ''[[Tomb Raider (film)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2018) before that film took a more dramatic tone. She added that it was important to the entire creative team to keep the comedic elements of the film and the "very funny voice" of the character, since Danvers "is one of the funniest comic book characters. She's so sassy, she's such a smartass, she won’t take shit from anyone". Robertson-Dworet also credited Boden for helping to shape Danvers' voice in the film and the desire "to carve our own path and make sure we weren’t retreading the same territory [after the release of ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]''], and showing all facets of what women are capable of."&lt;ref name="RobertsonDworetEWMar2018" /&gt; Feige added that ''Captain Marvel'' would have "homages to our favorite '90s action films", such as the action from ''[[Terminator 2]]'', "cool street level fights, street level car chases, and fun stuff like that", since the 1990s action genre was one Marvel Studios had yet to explore. He also stated much of the film would take place in outer space.&lt;ref name="FeigeMar2018" /&gt; Quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis from the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the [[California Institute of Technology]] consulted on the film.&lt;ref name="ScienceConsultant" /&gt;

By October, filming was slated to begin in March 2018. Feige described the film then as "a big part of heading towards" the then [[untitled Avengers film]], set for release after ''Captain Marvel'', and concluding the story being told across the first three phases of the MCU.&lt;ref name="MarFilmingStart" /&gt; [[Ben Mendelsohn]] entered negotiations to join the film as the main villain,&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn" /&gt; having previously worked with Boden and Fleck on their film ''[[Mississippi Grind]]''. They had him in mind for the ''Captain Marvel'' villain when they first began working on this film's story, and once they had met with him about the role, Mendelsohn "quickly agreed to pursue" it.&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn2" /&gt; By November, [[Jude Law]] was in negotiations for the role of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Walter Lawson / Mar-Vell]] in the film.&lt;ref name="Law" /&gt; In January 2018, [[DeWanda Wise]] was cast as [[Maria Rambeau]],&lt;ref name="Wise" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EWLynch" /&gt; and Mendelsohn and Law were confirmed to have been cast.&lt;ref name="Wise" /&gt; Feige stated that Law was an actor Marvel had "admired for a long time and have wanted to find a role for in our movies", feeling his part in ''Captain Marvel'' was "extraordinary". For Law, he felt Marvel was "an interesting party to join in with at an interesting time in their ascendancy. That to me is an interesting playground to work in," noting Marvel's "effort [in recent years] to hire independent directors with distinct voices".&lt;ref name="EWLaw" /&gt;

===Filming===
[[Location shooting]] occurred at the end of January 2018.&lt;ref name="JanLocationShooting" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LocationShooting" /&gt; Set photos taken at that time showed Larson in a green and black uniform instead of the character's familiar red and blue suit. Feige responded by saying that Marvel accepts the risk of set photos being leaked as a consequence of location shooting, and felt that "most people are savvy enough to know they're looking at a behind-the-scenes photo, completely out of context." He added that a large amount of scenes in the film would be shot on location.&lt;ref name="LocationShooting" /&gt;

A month later, [[Gemma Chan]] joined the cast as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]].&lt;ref name="Chan" /&gt; In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film due to a scheduling conflict with her television series ''[[She's Gotta Have It (TV series)|She's Gotta Have It]]''.&lt;ref name="NoWise" /&gt; The following day, [[Lashana Lynch]] entered into negotiations to replace Wise.&lt;ref name="Lynch" /&gt; By the end of the month, Lynch was confirmed while [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], and [[Clark Gregg]] were set to reprise their roles as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], and [[Phil Coulson]], respectively, from earlier MCU films. [[Algenis Perez Soto]], [[Rune Temte]], and [[Mckenna Grace]] were also set to star.&lt;ref name="FullCastAnnouncement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="THRFilmingStart" /&gt; At the same time, Marvel credited Boden and Fleck and the writing team of Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch with writing the screenplay along with LeFauve, Perlman and Robertson-Dworet.&lt;ref name="FullCastAnnouncement" /&gt; Additionally, Bek Smith worked on production rewrites for the film, after spending a year in Marvel's writers program.&lt;ref name="SmithRewrites" /&gt; With the inclusion of Korath, Ronan, and Coulson (characters established and killed in earlier films), Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the film "provide[d] the MCU with another unique opportunity to strengthen the presence of some characters who may not have lived up to their potential and to give great actors, particularly those who portrayed ill-fated villains, a chance to bring more to their roles than their initial opportunities allowed... ''Captain Marvel'' allows these characters to become more prominent, and while their fates are sealed for now, their pasts and the stories that reside there can entirely change our perception of them."&lt;ref name="THRMar2018" /&gt;

[[Principal photography]] began on March 19 in Los Angeles,&lt;ref name="FilmingStart" /&gt; under the [[working title]] ''Warbird'',&lt;ref name="FilmingStartEnd" /&gt; with [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] serving as director of photography, marking his fourth time working as a cinematographer in the MCU following ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', and ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]''.&lt;ref name="FullCastAnnouncement" /&gt; A carnival scene, set in 1986 and featuring Danvers and Fury, was filmed later that week at the [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall Racing Club]] in [[Oxnard, California]].&lt;ref name="OxnardFilming" /&gt; Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' in Los Angeles, along with other big-budget films that took advantage of California's improved tax credit program, helped raise on-location feature film production in the area by 11.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017; it was the first two-figure increase in production since the fourth quarter of 2015.&lt;ref name="FilmingIncrease" /&gt; Filming at [[Shaver Lake]] outside [[Fresno, California]] was set to take place in April under the working title ''Open World'',&lt;ref name="ShaverLake" /&gt; but was pushed back to mid-May.&lt;ref name="ShaverLake2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ShaverLake3" /&gt; In late April, Feige stated that filming was a little less than halfway completed.&lt;ref name="FeigeApr2018" /&gt; The following month, [[Annette Bening]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.&lt;ref name="Bening" /&gt; In late June, principal photography moved to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and [[New Orleans]] for two weeks,&lt;ref name="FullCastAnnouncement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CaliforniaFilmingEnd" /&gt; also using the working title ''Open World'',&lt;ref name="LouisianaBudget" /&gt; before concluding on July 6.&lt;ref name="FilmingEnd" /&gt;

===Post-production===
Additional photography was confirmed to have begun in late November 2018 via set photos.&lt;ref name="AdditionalPhotography" /&gt; With the release of the theatrical poster in early December 2018, Marvel provided updated writing credits for the film, crediting Perlman and the writing team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse for the story, and Boden, Fleck, Robertson-Dworet, and [[Jac Schaeffer]] for the screenplay.&lt;ref name="SecondTrailerAndPoster" /&gt; Visual effects were created by Lola VFX, with the company working on the de-aging of Jackson and Gregg.&lt;ref name="LolaVFX" /&gt;

==Music==
In May 2018, Clark Gregg indicated the film's soundtrack would include songs from the 1990s.&lt;ref name="GreggEWMay2018" /&gt; [[Pinar Toprak]] signed on to compose the film's score by the following month, making her the first woman to score an MCU film.&lt;ref name="Toprak" /&gt;

[[File:Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum.jpg|thumb|Airmen from the [[Air Force District of Washington]] attending a screening of the first ''Captain Marvel'' trailer at the [[National Air and Space Museum]]]] 
Concept art from the film was shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con.&lt;ref name="2017SDCC" /&gt; In June 2018, Feige revealed a look at Larson as Danvers at [[CineEurope]].&lt;ref name="CineEurope" /&gt; Larson debuted the first trailer in September 2018 at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.&lt;ref name="DeadlineFirstTrailer" /&gt; Petrana Radulovic of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt the trailer showed "large-scale action and intergalactic mayhem that reaches for ''[[Avengers: Infinity War|Infinity War]]''{{'}}s heights."&lt;ref name="PolygonFirstTrailer" /&gt; Ben Kuchera, also of ''Polygon'', felt opening the trailer with [[Blockbuster Video]] was "fitting" and an "anchoring shot" since its logo "remains instantly identifiable to a large audience", and pointed out that the scenes of Danvers as an Airforce pilot "appear to nod at the famously sun-drenched ''Top Gun''" that calls back "to the golden era of films about fighter pilots."&lt;ref name="PolygonFirstTrailer2" /&gt; Devan Coogan of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the trailer "a powerful introduction to the MCU’s first solo female hero."&lt;ref name="EWFirstTrailer" /&gt; Graeme McMillian of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' noted that Nick Fury's narration dominates the first half of the trailer which "grounds the trailer in something — some{{em|one}} — familiar for the Marvel faithful, and lays the groundwork for Carol Danvers’ first words." He also noted that the film's apparent departure from its' comic book origins removes "the self-determination and agency of Carol Danvers", which was "a risky proposition" to long-time fans of the character.&lt;ref name="THRFirstTrailer" /&gt; Richard Newby, also of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', felt the trailer "waste[d] no time in not only establishing Captain Marvel’s tremendous power set, but also distinguishing her from the heroes that have come before." Newby also noted, that since Captain Marvel's powers are not as recognizable for the general audience, Marvel does not use their "unfamiliarity to present the character as a joke" as they did with ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'', but "[r]ather it makes a statement that Captain Marvel means business, and if you don’t know her, well buckle up because she’s about to change the universe." Newby commended cinematographer Ben Davis from the trailer for making the film's identity "distinct" from the other MCU films he worked on, noting ''Captain Marvel'' seemed "more grounded" than Davis' work on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' or ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' and appeared to be inspired by the films of [[Tony Scott]], [[Roland Emmerich]], and [[Richard Donner]].&lt;ref name="THRFirstTrailer2" /&gt; The trailer was viewed 109 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the [[List of most-viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|11th most viewed trailer in that time period]].&lt;ref name="FirstTrailerViews" /&gt;&lt;!--

On December 3, 2018, the second trailer was released during halftime of the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].&lt;ref name="SecondTrailerAndPoster" /&gt;--&gt;

But here's the thing, if you were just going to do a straight adaptation of the comics, her origin story is very similar to Green Lantern. And obviously, that's not what we want to do. There's a lot of reinvention that needs to happen. And also, she's her own person and she's a great character. We have to be aware of what's happened in other Marvel film and makes sure that her particular storyline is unique and fun and also fits in within this world that's going on at the same time. It's a little bit of an interesting story gauntlet. It's been good to have a partner. It's been an incredible experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4881">'''Children of a Dead Earth''' is a space warfare game released in 2016 featuring realistic orbital mechanics and battle tactics.

== Development and reception ==
The game was developed by Q Switched Productions, LLC and was released on 23 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.awargamersneedfulthings.co.uk/2016/10/children-of-dead-earth-review.html|title=Children of a Dead Earth Review|work=A Wargamers Needful Things|access-date=2018-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024035144/http://www.awargamersneedfulthings.co.uk/2016/10/children-of-dead-earth-review.html|archive-date=2018-10-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's website states that "Children of a Dead Earth was created to discover what space warfare would be like.

While not intended to be a casual game, the game features "extensive guides on orbital mechanics, laser engineering, nuclear physics, rocket science and everything else you will need".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thetorchentertainmentguide.com/game-review-children-of-a-dead-earth-q-switched-productions/|title=Game Review – Children of a Dead Earth [Q Switched Productions]|date=2016-11-01|work=The Torch Entertainment Guide|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503022313/http://thetorchentertainmentguide.com/game-review-children-of-a-dead-earth-q-switched-productions/|archive-date=2017-05-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of the game features various missions which require the player to construct an appropriate space ship, a feature that creates comparisons with spaceship simulator [[Kerbal Space Program]].

The [https://childrenofadeadearth.wordpress.com/ official blog] for the game contains detailed information about the science behind the game. There is also a [http://coade.wikia.com/wiki/Children_of_a_Dead_Earth_Wiki fan curated wiki].

== Plot ==
In the near future, Earth has become uninhabitable thanks to warfare and climate change. Surviving humans have left earth to rebuild and colonise other planets. Two human factions (the Republic and the United Sol Trade Alliance) emerge and begin to contest for dominance of the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChildrenOfADeadEarth|title=Children Of A Dead Earth (Video Game) - TV Tropes|website=TV Tropes|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023234245/https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChildrenOfADeadEarth|archive-date=2018-10-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Collage]] film''' is a style of [[film]] created by juxtaposing [[Found footage (appropriation)|found footage]] from disparate sources. The term has also been applied to the physical [[collaging]] of materials onto [[film stock]].&lt;ref name=beaver&gt;{{cite book|last=Beaver|first=Frank Eugene|title=Dictionary of Film Terms: The Aesthetic Companion to Film Art|date=January 2006|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|isbn=978-0-8204-7298-0|page=46|chapter=Collage film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jj7vAjkArz4C&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=%22collage%20film%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surrealist roots of collage film==
The [[surrealist]] movement played a critical role in the creation of the collage film form. In 1936, the [[United States|American]] artist [[Joseph Cornell]] produced one of the earliest collage films with his reassembly of ''[[East of Borneo]]'' (1931), combined with pieces of other films, into a new work he titled ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' after the leading actress.&lt;ref name="rose hobart"&gt;Rony, Fatimah Tobing. The Quick and the Dead: Surrealism and the Found Ethnographic Footage Films of Bontoc Eulogy and Mother Dao: The Turtlelike. Camera Obscura. January 2003, Vol. 18 Issue 52&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Salvador Dalí]] saw the film, he was famously enraged, believing Cornell had stolen the idea from his thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/25/joseph-cornell-wanderlust-royal-academy-exhibition-london  Joseph Cornell: how the reclusive artist conquered the art world – from his mum’s basement-The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Adrian Brunel]]  made, twelve years before,  ''Crossing the Great Sagrada'' (1924)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/440503/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henri Storck]]  conceived, four years earlier,  ''Story of the Unknown soldier'' (''Histoire du soldat inconnu'') (1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinematek.be/?node=30&amp;dvd_id=24&amp;lng=en]&lt;/ref&gt;)

The idea of combining film from various sources also appealed to another surrealist artist [[André Breton]]. In the town of Nantes, he and friend Jacques Vaché would travel from one movie theater to another, without ever staying for an entire film.&lt;ref name= "breton"&gt;André Breton, Nadja (Paris: Gallimard, 1964), and Breton, “As in a Wood.”  L’age du cinema (1951) as reprinted in ''The Shadow and Its Shadows'', ed. Paul Hammond (London: The British Film Institute, 1991).  As cited by Rony, Fatimah Tobing. The Quick and the Dead: Surrealism and the Found Ethnographic Footage Films of Bontoc Eulogy and Mother Dao: The Turtlelike. Camera Obscura. Jan2003, Vol. 18 Issue 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance==
A renaissance of found footage films emerged after [[Bruce Conner]]'s ''[[A Movie]]'' (1958). The film mixes [[ephemeral film]] clips in a dialectical montage. A famous sequence made up of disparate clips shows "a submarine captain [who] seems to see a scantily dressed woman through his periscope and responds by firing a torpedo which produces a nuclear explosion followed by huge waves ridden by surfboard riders."&lt;ref&gt;Wees, William. ''Recycled Images: The Art and Politics of Found Footage Films'' Anthology Film Archives, New York: 1993: P.14 {{ISBN|0-911689-19-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conner continued to produce several other found footage films including ''[[Report (film)|Report]]'' and ''[[Crossroads (1976 film)|Crossroads]]'' among others.

Working at the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) in the 1960s, [[Arthur Lipsett]] created collage films such as ''[[Very Nice, Very Nice]]'' (1961) and ''[[21-87]]'' (1963), entirely composed of found footage discarded during the editing of other films (the former earning an Academy Award nomination).&lt;ref name=Wees&gt;{{cite web|last=Wees|first=William C.|title=From Compilation to Collage: The Found-Footage Films of Arthur Lipsett|url=http://www.filmstudies.ca/journal/pdf/cj-film-studies162_Wees_collage_g.pdf|work=Martin Walsh Memorial Lecture, 2007|publisher=Canadian Journal of Film Studies|accessdate=25 February 2012|volume=16 |issue=2 |date=Fall 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the young [[Joe Dante]] made ''[[The Movie Orgy]]'' with producer [[Jon Davison (film producer)|Jon Davidson]] that featured outtakes, trailers and commercials from various shows and films.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g7fp4v8bTEo TFH Exclusive: A Clip from THE MOVIE ORGY-YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent examples==
Other notable users of this technique are [[Chuck Workman]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://film.avclub.com/the-source-1798195190 The Source-AV Club]&lt;/ref&gt; with his Oscar-winning ''[[Precious Images]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-22/entertainment/ca-1490_1_andy-warhol MOVIE REVIEW: Will the Real Andy Warhol Please Stand Up?:Documentary: Entertaining look at the pop superstar illuminates the artist rather than the man-LA Times]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Craig Baldwin]] in his films ''Spectors of the Spectrum'', ''[[Tribulation 99]]'' and ''O No Coronado'' and Bill Morrisson who used found footage lost and neglected in film archives in his 2002 work ''[[Decasia]]'' (which alongside [[Kevin Rafferty]]'s 1982 Cold War satire ''[[The Atomic Cafe]]'' were inducted to the National Film Registry). A similar entry in the found footage canon is Peter Delpeut's ''[[Lyrical Nitrate]]'' (1991).

The technique was employed in the 2008 feature film ''[[The Memories of Angels]]'', a visual ode to [[Montreal]] composed of [[stock footage]] from over 120 NFB films from the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="Hays"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2008/10/08/f-memories-of-angels.html|title=Montreal, mon amour|last=Hays|first=Matthew |date=October 8, 2008|work=CBC News|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terence Davies]] used a similar technique to create ''[[Of Time and the City]]'', recalling his life growing up in [[Liverpool]] in the 1950s and 1960s, using [[newsreel]] and documentary footage supplemented by his own commentary voiceover and contemporaneous and [[classical music]] soundtracks.&lt;ref name="liverpool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-life-features/liverpool-arts/2008/05/21/liverpool-film-portrait-takes-cannes-film-festival-by-storm-64375-20940233/|title=Liverpool film portrait takes Cannes film festival by storm|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 experimental documentary ''[[Fraud (film)|Fraud]]'' was sourced from over a hundred hours of home video footage uploaded to YouTube by an unknown family in the United States. The footage was  collaged with additional clips appropriated from other YouTube users and transformed into a 53-minute [[crime film]] about a family preoccupied with material consumption going to extreme lengths in order to get out from under unsustainable [[consumer debt|personal debt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bray|first1=Catherine|title=Hot Docs Film Review: ‘Fraud’|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/fraud-review-1201769267/|website=Variety|publisher=Michelle Sobrino|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable collage documentaries===

*''[[June 17th, 1994]]''
*''[[LA 92 (film)|LA 92]]''
*''[[Our Nixon]]''
*''[[Tarnation (2003 film)|Tarnation]]''
*''[[Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? (film)|Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?]]''

==Comedies==
Some of the earliest surrealist collage works were humorous. This tradition of using film collage for comedic effect can later be seen in commercial films such as [[Woody Allen|Woody Allen's]] first film, ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' in which Allen took a [[Japan]]ese [[spy film]] by [[Senkichi Taniguchi]], re-edited parts of it and wrote a new soundtrack made up of his own dialogue for comic effect, and [[Carl Reiner]]'s 1982 comedy ''[[Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid]]'' which incorporated footage from approximately two dozen classic [[film noir]] films along with original sequences with [[Steve Martin]].

==Physical film collaging==
Some filmmakers have taken a more literal approach to collage film. [[Stan Brakhage]] created films by collaging [[found object]]s between clear [[film stock]], then passing the results through an [[optical printer]], such as in ''[[Mothlight]]'' and ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights (1981 film)|The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.

==Animation==

It is the first stand-alone web series launched by a major television network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvovermind.com/tv-news/nbc-launches-ctrl-a-new-web-series/6455 |title=NBC launches CTRL, A New Web Series |accessdate=2009-07-15 |author=AstroJones |date=2009-07-14 |publisher=''TV Overmind''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series stars [[Tony Hale]] as a typical office-working, self-confidence-lacking nerd who discovers he can undo things (as well as employ other keyboard functions) in real life. It is an adaptation and expansion of the short film ''Ctrl Z'' by [[Robert Kirbyson]], which was a winner at the 2008 [[Sundance Film Festival]].

''CTRL'' was spotted and developed by SXM from the original short film ''Ctrl Z'', which was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008. SXM ultimately partnered with NBC's digital studio to produce the online series. After NBC shut the digital studio in 2011, all rights reverted to SXM, who are currently developing Season 2 with [[Yahoo]] and a private investor. As of early 2012, the episodes appear to have been removed from the NBC website, but can be found on [[Hulu]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12356">A '''cultureme''' is any portion of [[cultural behavior]] apprehended in signs of symbolic value that can be broken down into smaller units or amalgamated into larger ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095652765 |title=Cultureme |publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cultureme is a "cultural information-bearing unit"&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicolae|first=Adina Oana|date=2015|title=Multicultural dialogue: translating culturemes|url=|journal=Discourse as a Form of Multiculturalism in Literature and Communication|language=|volume=3|pages=215-222|doi=|isbn=978-606-8624-21-1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the contents of which are recognizable by a group of people. Culturemes are the bridge between linguistic units and culture.

Their usage can be seen in cultural expressions, [[phraseologism]]s, [[jokes]], [[slogan]]s, [[literature]], [[religion]], [[folklore]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], etc.&lt;ref name="elies"&gt;[http://elies.rediris.es/Language_Design/LD11/LD11-05-Lucia.pdf Luque Nadal, L. (2009): "Los culturemas: ¿unidades lingüísticas, ideológicas o culturales?" en Language Design 11, págs. 93-120] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of which are subcultures in a culture system. Culturemes of this nature have historical relevance that when translated or explained result in a miscommunication and misunderstanding. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The notion of cultureme is being increasingly used in [[translation studies]] and other disciplines. It is a recently used concept that is yet to be defined and distinguished from others, such as phraseme, idiom, symbol, cultural word, etc.&lt;ref name="elies" /&gt;

== Phases of a Cultureme ==

Fernando Poyatos breaks down the features of a cultureme into four phases. These phases analysis the broadest of culturemes to the most particular aspects of culturemes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/654436579|title=The Mutual interaction of people and their built environment : a cross-cultural perspective|last=|first=|date=1976|publisher=Mouton|others=Rapoport, Amos., International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (9th : 1973 : Chicago)|year=|isbn=9789027979094|location=The Hague|pages=265–274|oclc=654436579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase One: Basic Culturemes ===

'''Basic culturemes''' are the broadest of culturemes. They characterize the initial semblance of a culture. Basic culturemes are separated into two cultural "realms," '''urban''' and '''rural''', and two domains: exterior and interior.  Basic culturemes begin with urban and rural realms because of their dichotomy in cultural identity and displays of social interactions.  Within either cultures, there are '''exteriors''' (what is observed from the outside) and '''interiors''' (what is observed from the inside of buildings or establishments that are not seen from an outdoors perspective).  The main divisions of culturemes are: urban-exterior, urban-interior, rural-exterior, and rural-interior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The significance of basic culturemes is to give a general sense of surroundings. For instance,

&lt;blockquote href="Category:Articles with Spanish-language external links"&gt;"in ''North America'' (United States and Canada): the larger size of many automobiles, the summery sound and smell of lawn mowing, the smell of city bus exhausts, the basic separation of the 'downtown' business and residential areas in the small town or village, the sirens of their police cars, the smell of hamburger and French fries of many eating establishments, the unique drugstore smell, the 'Licensed' signs in many second-rate restaurants (indicating a cultural attitude towards drinking"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48375754|title=Nonverbal communication across disciplines|last=Fernando.|first=Poyatos,|date=2002|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|year=|isbn=1556197535|location=Amsterdam|pages=11|oclc=48375754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Phase Two: Primary Culturemes ===
'''Primary culturemes''' exist in the phase when acculturation occurs, in which one's culture is becoming more complex. The basic four culturemes are subcategorized into '''environmental''' (cultural settings) and '''behavioral''' (behaviors of people and their interactions). These culturemes are a result of recognizing cultural patterns and "experiencing it through mere observation or systemic learning." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48375754|title=Nonverbal communication across disciplines|last=Fernando.|first=Poyatos,|date=2002|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|year=|isbn=1556197535|location=Amsterdam|pages=12|oclc=48375754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase Three: Secondary Culturemes ===
Culturemes are further broken down into settings, in which a specific culture is exemplified. These includes cultures in the school, the park, the bar, etc.  These are '''secondary culturemes'''. Phase three is the point where the cultures identified in phase two begin to interact; interrelationships are seen among different cultural systems and values.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Phase Four: Tertiary Culturemes ===
Phase four delves deeper into human senses, analyzing to the fullest extent possible.  The completion of phase four allows one to identify the cultureme's cultural system and subculture. Knowing the cultural system and subculture are important as it helps to navigate through other identifiable systems within the culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Translation ==
Translating a cultureme can be challenging, as [[connotation]]s are sometimes very strong. For instance: the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''alcázar'' means "the castle", "palace" or "fortress", but, as it is of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin, it recalls eight centuries of history ([[Al Andalus]]), which cannot be easily translated into English, so the translator must adopt a crucial decision: either choose the English word "fortress" and lose all the historical and cultural connotations, or use the [[loan word]] [[Alcázar|alcazar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.um.es/tonosdigital/znum24/secciones/tritonos-3-culturemas.htm Translation of culturemes for tourism] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A language may have various cultures and various languages may share the same culture. Cultures may differ in conceptualization that may in turn affect how thoughts are conveyed in their languages. The asymmetry of language complicates the matter of providing a linguistically and culturally sound equivalent of a cultureme in another language. The complex relationship of language and culture is significant in giving culturemes their intended value. Dictionaries further complicate cross-cultural gaps of meaning because without the collaborative effort of all cultures, it is impossible to define the significance of words that may be culturemes in the dictionary. Though, slowly, interactive and multimedia dictionaries have become extensive in information that lessen the bridge across languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaskot|first=Maciej Paweł|last2=Ganoshenko|first2=Iurii|date=2015-12-31|title=Culturemes and Non-Equivalent Lexis in Dictionaries|url=https://ispan.waw.pl/journals/index.php/cs-ec/article/view/cs.2015.009|journal=Cognitive Studies {{!}} Études cognitives|language=|volume=|issue=15|pages=115–124|doi=10.11649/cs.2015.009|issn=2392-2397|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturemes are translated in several ways:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li href="Category:Articles with Spanish-language external links"&gt;Literal translation: Language of the cultureme is rendered in another language in attempts to convey the same core meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functional equivalence: Translating meaning without the inclusion of its cultural association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Near-synonymy: A translation has a similar meaning to the cultureme without being identical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Under-specification: A space-saving technique that give a short and manageable definition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distortion: A translation that does not preserve the same meaning as the cultureme.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explanation: A translator uses this technique in their efforts to get the audience to fully understand the meaning. This can involve lengthy and overly detailed descriptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Category change: In the instance that the cultureme is obsolete or no longer relevant, a modern-day equivalent is provided.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glossary: A given text provides a definition at the end&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li href="International Standard Book Number"&gt;Over-specification: More information is given than required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No translation: Some culturemes are kept in their original language. This applies mainly to [[Latin script|Roman script]] languages, though other languages may have their culturemes [[Romanization|romanized]].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omission: The translator may omit what they judge to be peripheral in what is meant to be said.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicolae|first=Adina Oana|date=2015|title=Multicultural dialogue: translating culturemes|url=|journal=Discourse as a Form of Multiculturalism in Literature and Communication|language=|volume=3|pages=215–222|doi=|isbn=978-606-8624-21-1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Culture: Norms, Ideas, and Materials ===

In translating, the inability to convey cultural meaning strips a cultureme of its "cultureme" title and it simply becomes an ambiguous word. Culture is classified into three categories: Norms, Ideas, and Materials.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Kyung-Eun|last2=Shin|first2=Keun-Hye|last3=Kim|first3=Ki-Sun|date=2015-12-01|title=Research on limitations of indirect literary translation and aspects of cultural vocabulary translation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|journal=Neohelicon|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=603–621|doi=10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|issn=0324-4652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;li&gt;'''Norms''' refer to the habits and traditions of a societal group. A culture with a foundation of politeness that uses [[honorific]] terms of address, such as in the [[Korean language|Korean]] language, has very intricate forms of pronouns that have nonequivalence in other languages, e.g. English. Different cultures and languages have different interpretations of politeness that affects how successful a cultureme is translated. Traditional holidays are norms in a culture. The Vietnamese New Year ''[[Tết]]'' is a cultureme of the Vietnamese language and culture. ''Tết'' signifies the start of the new year on the [[Lunar calendar]]. It is a day of being home with family and cheerful celebration. A literal translation of ''Tết'' to English would be "New Year." But, anyone who had no knowledge of the cultureme would think the traditions and practices of "New Year's" all the same.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;*'''Ideas''' refer to "scientific truths, religious beliefs, myths, legends, works of literature, superstitions, aphorisms, proverbs, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Kyung-Eun|last2=Shin|first2=Keun-Hye|last3=Kim|first3=Ki-Sun|date=2015-12-01|title=Research on limitations of indirect literary translation and aspects of cultural vocabulary translation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|journal=Neohelicon|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=614|doi=10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|issn=0324-4652|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These culturemes are deep rooted in shared, personal history that outsiders of a culture are unfamiliar with knowing. Culturemes pertaining to cultural ideas do not need explained in the present, their meanings and significance are cemented in the people's knowledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*'''Materials''' refer to physical culture. Food, for instance, is a important example of tangible culture; it can illustrate dietary culture/lifestyle. Certain dishes are staples of the culture and can be a product of the local surroundings. The existence of a food or dish may have historical relevance to a culture. Translation in recipes that involve food cultureme can result in the wrong ingredients being introduced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Many songs, albums, bands and performances have referenced [[Donald Trump]] or his various brands, including [[Trump Tower]], his TV show, his hotel chain, and his casinos.&lt;ref name="McCann, 2016" /&gt; Though recent songs refer to Trump's campaign and subsequent election as [[President of the United States]], more than 200 songs refer to Trump prior to his successful presidential campaign between 1989 and 2013.&lt;ref name="Bristout, 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bristout|first1=Ralph|title=38 rap references that display Donald Trump's fall from hip-hop grace|url=https://revolt.tv/stories/2016/11/02/38-rap-references-display-donald-trumps-fall-hiphop-grace-07003da490|website=Revolt TV|accessdate=November 13, 2016|date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his victory in the 2016 presidential election, Trump's prominence in hip-hop music has been likened to that of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s in [[hardcore punk]] during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Barshad, 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barshad|first1=Amos|title=The Joy Of "Fuck Trump": YG and some goofy kids from Baltimore have the Trump catharsis you need.|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/04/06/yg-nipsey-hussle-anti-trump-rap-songs|publisher=The Fader|accessdate=November 13, 2016|date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Hip hop===
Trump's name first appeared in [[hip hop]] lyrics during the 1980s when the business mogul became an icon of the ultra rich. Among the earliest mentions of Trump in rap lyrics was the [[Beastie Boys]]' track "Johnny Ryall" on the 1989 ''[[Paul's Boutique]]'' album, in which they contrast Donald Trump with his homeless [[alter-ego]], Donald Tramp.&lt;ref name="Bristout, 2016" /&gt;

While many rappers praise Trump's wealth, usually comparing their own financial aspirations or success to that of the billionaire businessman, others have used their music as a platform to criticize Trump's practices and politics.&lt;ref name="Finley, 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finley|first1=Taryn|title=67 Times Rappers Name Dropped ‘Donald Trump’|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hip-hops-25-year-obsession-with-donald-trump_us_55d61727e4b055a6dab3524a|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=November 12, 2016|date=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the earliest of these was [[The Coup (band)|The Coup]] from [[Oakland, California]], who critiqued and mocked Trump on their first two albums released in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="McCann, 2016" /&gt;

[[ESPN]]'s political site [[FiveThirtyEight]] documented that between 1989 and 2014, 19% of song lyrics about Trump were negative while 60% were positive. The 2010s marked a left-leaning political shift in musicians' attitude toward Trump as his presence in the public eye changed from that of a business tycoon to a politician, particularly one known for making controversial statements. Because of hip hop's close association with minority  communities and its reinvigorated politicization with the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, lyrical depictions of Trump rapidly grew to be more disparaging throughout his campaign and subsequent election as President of the United States.&lt;ref name="McCann, 2016" /&gt;

Many artists have name-checked Trump in more than one song. Pre-presidency, [[Rick Ross]] had the most Trump mentions (nine songs between 2008 and 2015) with [[Nas]] running second (seven songs between 1996 and 2012). Other major Trump name-checkers include [[Migos]] (six songs between 2013 and 2016), [[Young Thug]] (six songs between 2013 and 2015), [[Lil Wayne]] (five songs between 2000 and 2012) and [[Raekwon]] (five songs between 1995 and 2012).&lt;ref name="McCann, 2016" /&gt;

====Mac Miller controversy====
When [[Mac Miller]]'s 2011 song "[[Donald Trump (song)|Donald Trump]]" became a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hit, Trump released a [[YouTube]] video congratulating the rapper:

{{quote|A lot of people are calling me about the Mac Miller rap song. Now, it's named "Donald Trump." Maybe you should pay me a lot of money, but it just did over 20 million people, tuning into Mac Miller. So in one way, I'm proud of him. I haven't actually seen the language... Probably, it's not the cleanest language you've ever heard... But the "Donald Trump" song just hit over 20 million, that's not so bad. I'm very proud of him.&lt;ref name="Zaru, 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaru|first1=Deena|title=What hip-hop lyrics tell us about Donald Trump|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/02/politics/donald-trump-rich-hip-hop-lyrics-rap/|accessdate=November 26, 2016|publisher=CNN|date=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the song garnered more plays, Trump took a more aggressive tone and demanded [[royalties]] for using his name, thereby starting a feud with Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Makarechi |first1=Kia |title=Mac Miller, Donald Trump's Least Favorite Rapper, Revisits Feud |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/mac-miller-donald-trump-feud |accessdate=June 13, 2016 |work=Vanity Fair |date=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013, Trump threatened the rapper via a series of exchanges on [[Twitter]]:

{{quote|Little @MacMiller, you illegally used my name for your song “Donald Trump” which now has over 75 million hits.
I want the money not the plaque you gave me!
I’m now going to teach you a big boy lesson about lawsuits and finance. You ungrateful dog!
I have more hair than you do and there’s a slight age difference.&lt;ref name="Trump, 1/31/2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trump|first1=Donald|title=@MacMiller|url=https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/297084584334589952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw|website=Twitter|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2015 Trump changed his attitude toward Miller again when he ended an interview with ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' by praising Miller's song as it approached 100 million hits.&lt;ref name="Cirilli, 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cirilli|first1=Kevin|title=Trump praises rapper’s ‘great’ song about him|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/248911-trump-praises-rappers-great-song-about-him|accessdate=November 26, 2016|work=The Hill|date=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller later appeared on ''[[The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore]]'' to denounce Trump for [[Racial views of Donald Trump|his racial views]] during his run for President in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Comedy Central|title=The Nightly Show - Mac Miller Unloads on Donald Trump|date=2016-03-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm8ISls_TBA|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other styles of music===

Outside of hip hop, most lyrical references to Trump have appeared in songs ranging from [[satire]]s of the billionaire, to outright protest in varying degrees of explicitness. One of the earliest Trump send-ups was the 1990 ballad "Donald Trump (Black Version)" written by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] for fellow [[Minneapolis]] act [[The Time (band)|The Time]]  in which singer [[Morris Day]] calls himself a black version of Donald Trump, who can use his riches to "fulfill [a woman's] every wish, [and her] every dream".&lt;ref name="Jackson, 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=Lucas|title=Prince once wrote a song called "Donald Trump (Black Version)"|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/prince-once-wrote-a-song-called-donald-trump-black-version/|accessdate=November 22, 2016|agency=CBS News|publisher=CBS|date=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 Irish [[folk-rock]] group [[Goats Don't Shave]] had a #4 hit with "[[Las Vegas in the Hills of Donegal]]," which references Trump's [[casino]] business in imagining [[County Donegal|an Irish county]] that becomes a [[gambling]] mecca.&lt;ref name="Donegal 2016" /&gt;

More recently, songs like "Fergus Laing" by Scottish folk singer [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] present thinly veiled references to Trump without mentioning him by name, while songs like "Fucked Up Donald" by Canadian punk band [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]] are more direct. Many songs attack Trump by mocking his supporters through stereotypical portrayals of their views and lifestyles. [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]-based comedian Brian Nissen comedian stars as "Mullets Over America" spokesman Dwain in the music video "Make America Great Again", while Rocky Mountain Mike's cover of "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" remakes the lyrics to be about Trump, with the song's title alluding to the color of his skin. Sung from the perspective of a [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] Trump supporter, the song opens:

{{quote|Hey Mr. Tangerine Man, build a wall for me
I'm not that bright and don't know that you're not going to
Hey Mr. Tangerine Man, keep Muslims away from me
With my jingoistic worldview, I'll come following you.&lt;ref name="Hermann, 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hemann|first1=Andy|title=The 10 Best Trump Parodies and Protest Songs|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-10-best-trump-parodies-and-protest-songs-7052391|accessdate=November 14, 2016|agency=L.A. Weekly|date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In October 2016, author [[Dave Eggers]] launched a project slated to release one anti-Trump song each day leading up to [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016's election day]]. Originally called ''30 Songs, 30 Days'', Eggers' plan was to have each song performed by a different artist, but due to  more musicians coming through with songs, it grew to be 40, and then [[30 Days, 50 Songs|50 songs in 30 days]].&lt;ref name="Kornhaber, 2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/10/30-days-30-songs-donald-trump-death-cab-for-cutie/503783/ | title=Donald Trump Is Terrific Protest-Music Inspiration | work=The Atlantic | date=October 12, 2016 | accessdate=October 15, 2016 | author=Kornhaber, Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="30 Days, 30 Songs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.30days30songs.com/about|title=About 30 Days, 30 Songs|last=|first=|date=|website=30 Days, 40 Songs|publisher=Artists for a Trump-free America|access-date=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eggers worked on the project with [[Jordan Kurland]] with whom he had previously worked on two similar election-related projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.30days30songs.com/masthead|title=30 Days, 30 Songs: Masthead|last=Kurland|first=Jordan|date=|website=30 Days, 40 Songs|publisher=|access-date=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zeitgeistmanagement.com/|title=Zeitgeist Artist Management|last=|first=|date=|website=zeitgeistmanagement.com|publisher=|access-date=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cillizza, 2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/13/famous-musicians-are-writing-30-anti-trump-songs-for-the-final-30-days-of-the-election/ | title=Famous musicians are writing 30 anti-Trump songs for the final 30 days of the election | work=Washington Post | date=October 13, 2016 | accessdate=October 15, 2016 | author=Cillizza, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eggers' inspiration for the project came when attending a Trump rally in [[Sacramento]] earlier that year.&lt;ref name="Goodman, 2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/11/30-days-30-songs-dave-eggers-anti-trump-music | title=Inside the making of Dave Eggers' anti-Trump music project, 30 Days, 30 Songs | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=October 11, 2016 | accessdate=October 15, 2016 | author=Goodman, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participating artists included  [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[Aimee Mann]], [[Bhi Bhiman]], [[Jim James]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Josh Ritter]], [[Thao Nguyen]], [[EL VY]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Adia Victoria]], [[Moby]], [[Lila Downs]], [[Mac McCaughan]], [[Tim Bluhm]], [[Vinnie Paz]], [[Jesu (band)|Jesu]], [[Sun Kil Moon]], [[Filthy Friends (supergroup)|Filthy Friends]], [[Radioinactive]], [[Amuka|Sheila Brody]], [[Ani DiFranco]], [[Andrew Bird]], [[Mirah]], [[clipping.]], [[Sam Cohen (musician)|Sam Cohen]], [[Blake Hazard]], [[John Wesley Harding (singer)|Wesley Stace]], [[Loudon Wainwright III]], [[Cold War Kids]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[Mission of Burma]], [[Bob Mould]], [[Ryan Miller (musician)|Ryan Miller]], [[The Long Winters]], [[Open Mike Eagle]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Kyle Craft]], [[Local Natives]], [[Anthony D'Amato]], [[Greg Holden]], [[Laura Gibson]], [[Tim Heidecker]], [[Modern Baseball]], [[Joe Purdy]], and [[Rogue Wave (band)|Rogue Wave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.30days30songs.com/|title=30 Days, 30 Songs|website=30 Days, 30 Songs|access-date=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Compound Sound LLC released ''Trumped Music'', a 32-minute album of eight songs which are [[Fair Use]] parodies of famous hit songs throughout the years. These songs are sung by impressionist Christopher John as 'Donald Trump', with several tracks also featuring impressionist Andrew Harris as 'Vladimir Putin'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trumped Music|url=http://www.TrumpedMusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opera===
At the 2017 [[Lowlands (festival)|Lowlands Festival]] in the Netherlands, the American [[coloratura soprano]] [[Sara Hershkowitz]] performed [[György Ligeti]]'s 1992 concert excerpts from his opera ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'', titled ''Mysteries of the Macabre'', with the [[Noord Nederlands Orkest]]. She alluded to Donald Trump in three costumes which she changed on stage, a clown, baby outfit with a bottle, and a [[Miss America]] swimsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The principals are [[Peru]]vian [[singer]]s [[La Tigresa del Oriente]], [[Wendy Sulca]] and Indigenous Kichwa [[Ecuador]]ian singer-songwriter [[Delfin Quishpe]], known as ''"Delfín Hasta El Fín"''. Quishpe has expressed a desire to visit Israel.&lt;ref name=Entrevista&gt;[http://www.eluniverso.com/2010/05/05/1/1378/delfin-quishpe-el-grito-me-identifica.html] "Delfín Quishpe: ‘El grito me identifica’", 05 de mayo del 2010, El Universo.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The video==

The opening shot is of video  Delfin Quishpe sitting in a living room  watching television. People on television speak of war, fear, and the dangers of living in Israel, despite the obvious fact that they are not Israeli.  Delfin rises to his feet and shouts "This cannot be," spreading his arms high and wide.  The video segues to an introduction of each of the singers.   The song then continues as a lovesong to Israel and Israelis.&lt;ref name=Entrevista/&gt;  Gastón Cleiman, a [[Buenos Aires]] advertising man who wrote  the song’s lyrics describes it as, "a song against prejudice.”&lt;ref name=Carmon/&gt;  The score is by [[Gaby Kerpel]] and Daniel Mart.n&lt;ref name=Carmon/&gt; [[Picky Talarico]] directed.&lt;ref name=Carmon/&gt;

==Production==

The tracks were recorded separately. Wendy and Bustos were recorded in Lima, while Delfin was recorded in Ecuador.  The music was mixed and the video produced in [[Buenos Aires]] by Gaby Kerpel.&lt;ref name=Tiempo/&gt;   The three performers were not acquainted and did not meet during the production of the video.&lt;ref name=Entrevista/&gt;

==Cultural impact==

The video was intended by its creators to be taken as a genuinely naive work, a kind of online [[outsider art]].&lt;ref name=Carmon/&gt;  It was taken for such by [[Alma Guillermoprieto]] who gushed over it in the ultra-sophisticated [[New York Review of Books]], calling Latin America "the last great reservoir of innocent art," and continuing:

''"Their self-confidence and optimism we can only envy, and yet they have lives we can barely imagine (how much did the rural violence provoked by Peru’s Shining Path guerrillas influence Wendy’s parents’ decision to migrate to the capital?); they make choices that to us seem inscrutable (what is that monkey doing behind the rowboat?). But millions of people admire these singers. What the video shows us is the chaotic transformation of a culture that has always had an infinite and joyful capacity for self-invention. This is not outsider but insider art of the deepest sort, forged in a hot-hot crucible, and it is we who stand on the outside, peering wistfully at the screen."''&lt;ref name=Guillermoprieto&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2010/jun/09/what-monkey-doing-behind-rowboat/] "What is that Monkey Doing Behind the Rowboat? Alma Guillermoprieto, June 9, 2010, New York Review of Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The video’s great success has brought new opportunities for the three performers. A party promoter brought ''La Tigresa'' to  [[Buenos Aires]], where diners in an upscale restaurant greeter her by breaking into the chorus of “En Tus Tierras Bailaré.”&lt;ref name=Carmon/&gt; She was and hailed as a gay icon and stopped in the street by fans wanting photos.  There is  talk of a world tour, ending in Israel.&lt;ref name=Carmon/&gt;

The '''Festival of Lights''' ({{lang-fr|Fête des lumières}}) in [[Lyon]], [[France]] expresses gratitude toward [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] around December 8th of each year.&lt;ref name="Festival of Lights History" /&gt; This uniquely Lyonnaise tradition dictates that every house place candles along the outsides of all the windows to produce a spectacular effect throughout the streets. The festival includes other activities based on light and usually lasts four days, with the peak of activity occurring on the 8th. The two main focal points of activity are typically the [[Basilica of Fourvière]] which is lit up in different colours, and the [[Place des Terreaux]], which hosts a different light show each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr/en/edition/2010-program|title=2010-program at fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr/en/edition/2011-program|title=2011-program at fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr/en/edition/2012-program|title=2012-program at fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr/en/edition/2013-program|title=2013-program at fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr/en/edition/2014-festival|title=2014-festival at fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Spared from plague ===
The origins of the festival date to 1643 when Lyon was struck by [[Bubonic plague|plague]]. On September 8, 1643 the municipal councillors (''échevins'') promised to pay tribute to Mary if the town was spared. Ever since, a solemn procession makes its way to the Basilica of Fourvière on 8 December (the feast of the [[Immaculate Conception]]) to light candles and give offerings in the name of Mary. In part, the event thus commemorates the day Lyon was consecrated to the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histoire-pour-tous.fr/tourisme/101-france-sud-est/4995-la-fete-des-lumieres-lyon.html History of Lyon's 'fete des lumieres', at histoire-pour-tous.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inauguration of a statue ===
In 1852, it became a popular festival when a statue of the Virgin Mary was erected next to the Basilica, overlooking the city.&lt;ref name="Festival of Lights History" /&gt; Now a focal point of the festival, the statue was created by the renowned sculptor [[Joseph-Hugues Fabisch]] and was sponsored by several notable Lyonnais Catholics. It was then accepted by Maurice Cardinal de Bonald in 1850. The inauguration of the statue was due to take place on September 8, 1852, the day of celebration of the [[Nativity of Mary|Nativity of the Virgin]]&lt;!-- et date anniversaire du vœu des échevins de 1643 --&gt;. However, the flooding of the [[Saône River|Saône]] prevented the statue from being ready. The archbishop, with the agreement of a committee of lay people, therefore chose to move the date back to the 8 December.&lt;ref name="Festival of Lights History"&gt;[http://www.fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr/en/page/history Festival of Lights History at fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1852 in Lyon, December 8 had already been a celebration for the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin.&lt;ref name="Festival of Lights History" /&gt; Leading up to the inauguration, everything was in place for the festivities: The statue was lit up with flares, fireworks were readied for launching from the top of Fourvière Hill and marching bands were set to play in the streets. The prominent Catholics of the time suggested lighting up the façades of their homes as was traditionally done for major events such as royal processions and military victories.

However, on the morning of the big day, a storm struck Lyon.&lt;ref name="Festival of Lights History" /&gt; The master of ceremonies hastily decided to cancel everything and to push back the celebrations once more to the following Sunday. In the end the skies cleared and the people of Lyon, who had been eagerly anticipating the event, spontaneously lit up their windows, descended into the streets&lt;ref name="Festival of Lights History" /&gt; and lit flares to illuminate the new statue and the Chapel of Notre-Dame-de-Fourvière, later superseded by the Basilica. The people sang songs and cried "''Vive Marie!''" until late in the night. This celebration was then repeated from year to year.&lt;ref name="Festival of Lights History" /&gt;

== Today ==
[[File:Lumignons_fete_des_Lumieres_Lyon_8-12-2013.jpg|thumbnail|Candle lights on a windowsill on December 8.]]
Thus, tradition now dictates that every family in Lyon keep, along with its Christmas decorations, a collection of stained or clear glass in which candles are burnt on windowsills on 8 December. These stout, fluted candles can be found in shops towards the end of November.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr/fr/page/les-lumignons-du-coeur les-lumignons-du-Coeur ''(Candles of the Heart)'' at  fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, the city council puts on professionally run performances. The people of Lyon's participation remains strong as evidenced by numerous façades lit up in the traditional way and by the throngs of people wandering the streets on 8 December.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tripadvisor.fr/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g187265-d195594-i71760840-Cathedral_Saint_Jean_Baptiste-Lyon_Rhone_Rhone_Alpes.html Photograph of Cathedral_Saint_Jean_Baptiste-Lyon during fete des lumieres at tripadvisor.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians and sociologists{{who?|date=December 2012}} note the rather misinformed notions that the people of Lyon have concerning the celebration's origins: confusion over the thanks given to Mary, as well as the dates involved, leads people to think the celebration commemorates the establishment of the Basilica of [[Notre-Dame de Fourvière]] or a wish granted after a plague supposedly struck in the 19th century.

Nowadays, the festival draws 3 to 4 million people each year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Festival of Lights History" /&gt;

== Changes in 2015 and 2016 ==
In 2015, the festival was scaled back,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/nov/20/lyon-cancels-fete-des-lumieres-in-wake-of-paris-attacks Guardian article, November 2015: 'Lyon cancels fete des lumieres in wake of paris attacks' at theguardian.com]&lt;/ref&gt; owing to the nationwide state of emergency banning large assemblies in the wake of the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|November 13 attacks]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frenchmoments.eu/the-festival-of-lights-in-lyon-la-fete-des-lumieres-de-lyon/ the festival of lights in lyon 2015 postponed until 2016 at frenchmoments.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was limited to the traditional lumignon candles and an installation which paid tribute to the victims of the terrorist attacks, whose first names were displayed over the buildings of the quays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr/en/page/tribute-victims-terrorist-attacks-paris tribute to victims of terrorist attacks in Paris at fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the continuing risk of attacks, the 2016 edition of the festival took place in a smaller area than usual and will lasted for three days instead of four.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr/en/news/new-combined-security-system A new combined security system at fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; Security inspections were conducted at entrances to the event and additional security forces were provided by the [[Minister of Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/dec/09/lyons-fete-des-lumieres-returns-for-2016-amid-tight-security|title=Lyon's Fête des Lumières returns for 2016 amid tight security|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|date=9 December 2016|website=The Guardian|archive-url=https://archive.fo/Z1rgd|archive-date=14 November 2018|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of Gambling in Russia.svg|thumb|300px|Gambling subjects of Russia:&lt;br/&gt;[[Kaliningrad Oblast]],&lt;br/&gt;[[Azov-City]] ([[Krasnodar Krai]], Rostov Oblast part was excluded from list),&lt;br/&gt;[[Altai Krai]],&lt;br/&gt;[[Primorsky Krai]]]]

'''[[Gambling]] in [[Russia]]''' is legal in only four regional subject areas, and in 2009 was made illegal in all other areas of Russia.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 2009, gambling was banned almost everywhere in Russia. The only exceptions are four specially arranged zones in the Altai, Krasnodar, Kaliningrad, and Primorsky regions.

==Public Policy Economics Perspective==
Gambling has been a major policy problem for the Russian government since the early 21st century. The problem was the rapidly increasing number of [[slot machine]]s and gambling houses, including [[casino]]s, spreading all over the country.  This caused a little concern for the government.  According to city officials, after the year 2002 there were 58 casinos, 2,000 gaming rooms and approximately 70,000 slot machines in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casinoman.net/gambling-news/article/gambling-industry-flourishes-in-russia.4215.asp#|title=Gambling Industry Flourishes in Russia|author=|date=|website=casinoman.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It became a greater problem for the government because the [[Demographics of Russia|younger population]] was widely exposed to the obtrusive advertising of gambling houses. Teenagers missed school to crowd around slot machines hoping to win some money. This behavior affected the society’s welfare in a way that was external to the market, thus, giving rise to a negative externality. Experts from the Russian Association of Gambling Business Development claimed that approximately half a million people on a regular basis indulged in gambling in the capital city of Moscow. At the same time, city psychiatrists, who met with people addicted to excessive gambling, provided quite different information arguing that the number was much higher. “The head of the extra-hospital aid in the National Narcological Scientific Center Taras Dudko says that the number of people regularly going to Moscow casinos, bookmaking offices and gambling houses is over 1.5 million people”.&lt;ref name="english.pravda.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/history/08-10-2003/3863-gambling-0/|title=Russian Roulette: Gambling in Russia|first=Michael|last=Simpson|date=8 October 2003|website=pravda.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to marketing research by Bookmaker-Ratings, in Russia from May 2016 till May 2017 services of illegal offshore bookmakers were used by 1 million 410 thousand players, services of legal Russian bookmakers – by 820 thousand players. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bookmaker-ratings.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/betting-report-2017-en.pdf|title=Russian bookmaking industry: current state and growth perspectives. May 2017|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Additionally, money laundering was another concern of every city government that failed to collect estimated tax revenue from gambling businesses, that kept the profits and did not share them with the city by avoiding tax payment.&lt;ref name="english.pravda.ru"/&gt; 
These were the major rationales for the government to get involved and implement a policy on gambling restriction. 
One of the policy solutions to solve the gambling problem in Russia was proposed in the form of limiting the number of gambling establishments throughout the country. Additionally, the Moscow officials proposed to bar slot machine parlors within 500 yards of a residential area, which would force operators out of all urban areas in the country in order to protect the young generation from being tempted to lose money using slot machines.&lt;ref name="rg.ru"&gt;Федеральный закон Российской Федерации от 29 декабря 2006 г. N 244-ФЗ О государственном регулировании деятельности по организации и проведению азартных игр и о внесении изменений в некоторые законодательные акты Российской Федерации [http://www.rg.ru/2006/12/31/azart-dok.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The major policy problem about excessive gambling in the Russian society and their people’s continuous discontent with the spread of gambling houses all over the country finally led to the implementation of federal policy. Russia closed down its casinos overnight as gambling was banned nationwide. Thus since July 1, 2009, according to the Federal Law № 244 “On state regulation of organization and management of gambling”, the gambling business in Russia has been allowed only in four designated zones.&lt;ref name="rg.ru"/&gt; The ban was to protect the health of society, and was expected to put an end to the era which witnessed an eruption of gambling fueled by a lawless business culture, which caused great costs to the society. Despite the ban, gambling continues working, pretending to be Internet cafes, lottery clubs, nightclubs.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
At the end of 1927, the [[People’s Commissar of the Interior]] presented a report devoted to gambling and the gaming business existing at that time to the RSFSR SPC. The main idea voiced through the report was that its incompatibility of an idle, bourgeois pastime with
the true spirit of the working proletariat. And, regardless of the rather modest figures in the gaming sector (for example, only 4 small gaming houses operated in [[Leningrad]] at that time), the key prohibitive provisions in the report were approved.

All this led to a ban on the opening of gambling houses in worker districts, it was followed by a ban on gambling  in the entire districts, and later, on May 8, 1928, by the resolution of the USSR SPC, all Soviet Republics were instructed, the reasons not being explained, "to take measures on the immediate closure of any facilities for card games, roulette, lotto and other kinds of gambling". The closure of gaming houses and the gambling ban were pushed by the penal policy course shaped by the [[Soviet state]], providing for overall reinforcement of criminal sanctions in the country and the modification of the state's penitentiary policy upon the whole. Later, lotteries were also restricted. On June 6, 1928, the Workers-Peasants’ Government of the RSFSR issues the resolution, "On Banning the Draw of Liquors in Lotteries". First, on January 1, 1930, the USSR SPC issues the resolution "On the Procedure of Issuing Permits for Lottery Arrangement", and then, on August 31, 1932, another USSR SPC Resolution #1336 was announced, "On the Regulation of the Lottery Business".

The first slot machines which appeared in the country quite lawfully, were installed only in 1988  in hotels which were part of the USSR [[State Committee of Foreign Tourism]] (Goscomintourist). Within the system, the All-Russian Business External Trade Union (VHVO) "Intourservice" is set up, developing new kinds of additional services for foreign tourists, payable in free convertible currency. And private businesses have no access to gambling operations. Despite an eagerness to deal with slot machine installation and operation, the Soviete authorities allowed it only within its state structures, only as an experiment. To be on the safe side, there was a legal reminder that the business still cannot be entered. On December 29, 1988, the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the USSR]] issued another resolution, this time "On the Regulation of Certain Activities of Cooperatives According to the Law on Cooperation in the USSR", which, in particular, stressed that cooperatives are not entitled to perform gambling operations.

On August 23, 1989, the Soviet government lifted its ban on gambling and opened the first gambling house in Moscow and later, the first casino was opened in the capital city’s Savoy Hotel.

Poker in Russia was very popular during the collapse of the USSR, when people started being interested in Western culture and values.

In the Soviet Union it was possible to play poker only in cellar clubs or the casino. In addition, players often gathered in private flats. By the end of the 90s it was the first attempt to hold poker tournaments, but it did not get the widespread popularity at the time.

==Taxation==
In 2004, the Law #142-FZ “On Gambling Tax” being in effect for a sixth year, Chapter 29 “Gambling Tax” of the Russian Federation’s Tax Code came into effect. A new and the most complicated stage in the area of gambling taxation began. As of January 1, 2004, gambling tax became regional and its receipts are transferred to the budgets of the Federation’s constituent entities. As of 2004, each region was entitled to independently determine the gambling tax rate within the limits provided for by the Law #142-FZ “On Gambling Tax”. The taxation rate for [[slot machines]] with cash winnings was 1,500 to 7,500 roubles and for gaming tables, totalisator cash desks and [[bookmaker]] cash desks – 25,000 to 125,000 roubles.

In 2008, [[Anita Silvey]], author of ''100 Best Books for Children'', described ''Good Masters!

'''''Gothic 3''''' is a [[fantasy]]-themed [[open world]] [[action role-playing game]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] from the [[Germany|German]] game developer [[Piranha Bytes]].&lt;ref name="gspot_review"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gothic-3-review/1900-6162673/|title=Gothic 3 Review|last=Park|first=Andrew|date=December 4, 2006|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the sequel to ''[[Gothic II]]''. Although widely available in English, the native release of the game is German. The North American release incorporates two [[Patch (software)|patch]]es that appeared after the initial UK edition.

A ''Collector's Edition'' was also released containing bonus collectible material. [[JoWooD Entertainment|JoWooD]] released a standalone expansion, entitled ''[[Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods]]'', in November 2008.

==Gameplay==
The player must complete quests and slay wild animals and monsters to earn experience and improve skills. The game is reputation centric allowing the player to side with a faction. While there are six factions in the game, only three are joinable: the Rebels, the Orc mercenaries and the Hashishin. The remaining factions are the Rangers, the Nomads and the people of Nordmar. The player is able to take advantage of missions to allow either side to take over towns. Dialog changes according to in-game actions and behavior. The game places a special focus on the interactivity of the environment. The controls have been altered slightly with a stronger focus on action.  Navigation and combat are more mouse-centric, with each mouse button having a different combat action. The Nameless Hero can also now wield dual weapons or use a shield.

==Synopsis==

===Prologue===
The [[Gothic (video game)|first part of Gothic]] tells the story of The Nameless Hero, a man thrust into the events of a penal colony.  The colony takes the form of a [[natural landscape]] encased in a large magical shield known as The Barrier, much like an impenetrable dome.  Over the course of the story, The Nameless Hero becomes acquainted with several characters, the most notable of which are Diego, Lee, Cor Angar, Lester, Gorn, Lares, Milten, and Xardas.  Some of these characters are connected with the various factions of the game, which include the ''Old Camp'', the ''New Camp'' and the ''Swamp Camp''. Also connected with these factions are the water and fire mages, of which Xardas is an outcast.  Xardas, a necromancer, plays a central part to the survival and advancement of the character.  Ultimately, he galvanizes the character toward the ultimate goal of stopping the summoning of a beast known as ''The Sleeper'', but the entrance was guarded by a camp of orcs. The hero was helped by an orc shaman named Ur-Shak, who made an artifact that would prevent the orcs from attacking him. The Nameless Hero banishes ''The Sleeper'' at the cost of nearly losing his own life.

The [[Gothic II|second part of Gothic]] sees The Nameless Hero resurrected by Xardas into a new setting. Now located outside the city of Khorinis, he is asked by Xardas to investigate a new evil that threatens Khorinis and the surrounding lands. Over the course of the story, The Nameless Hero reconnects with old friends from the first chapter while adjusting to changes in the faction structure. With the penal colony and its barrier a thing of the past, the surrounding lands have been invaded by orcs.  Factions now consist of the ''Militia/Paladins'' of Khorinis, the ''Fire Novices/Fire Mages'', and the ''Mercenaries/Dragon Hunters''. Water mages also make a return.  Having discovered the source of the evil threatening Khorinis, our hero assembles a crew of trusted friends and sails to a nearby island. There he battles a large undead dragon, completing the central quest of the chapter. The chapter closes with the hero and his allies sailing away from the island.

''Gothic 2'' also has an expansion called ''Night of the Raven''. In the expansion, the Hero faced many new dangers and a new unexplored world. The Water Mages played an important role in the expansion. There was a new faction known as the Ring of Water, who had the same relationship to the Water Mages as the Paladins do to the Fire Mages. The main antagonist was Raven, who was second-in-command to Gomez, leader of the Old Camp, in the first game. Raven wanted to command the armies of Beliar, the evil one of the 3 gods, along with a new powerful weapon known as the Claw of Beliar.

===Plot===
The third part opens with the Nameless Hero and his friends sailing to a new continent overrun with orcs, arriving in Myrtana, the central region of the continent.  The hero lost all his belongings from the previous game when his ship is stolen while he's onshore with Milten, Diego, Gorn, and Lester.  Presumably this is the source of the orc invasion that was launched on Khorinis during the second chapter.  These lands have no physical connection to Khorinis or the ruins of the penal colony.  In these mountainous forests the orcs have enslaved the human kingdom with only a few free humans living in the nearly uninhabitable icy northlands of Nordmar and the southern desert of Varant.  The hero must decide whether to join the rebellion and stay true to the deposed human king, serve the Orcish usurpers in their quest to topple the last remaining human stronghold, or choose a path that serves his own ends.  Throughout the story, he is accompanied by a number of NPCs, some of whom are old friends.  While this chapter brings forward friends from the previous title (Xardas, Diego, Milten, Gorn, Lester, Lee, and Vatras) it also introduces two new major characters; King Rhobar the Second (who ultimately was responsible for sending the Nameless Hero to the penal colony in the first game) and Zuben.  While the king has a strong past as a bold leader, he now faces a near defeat; his fame is on the decline.  Zuben leads the Hashishin that inhabit the southern region of Varant.&lt;ref name="gothic3manual"&gt;''Gothic 3'' manual (all versions).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''Gothic 3'' is powered by a custom engine called Genome; it supports [[Pixel Shader|Pixel Shader 3.0]], has a [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreaded]] design and includes dynamic lighting (including [[self-shadowing]]). Character animation uses EMotion FX 2 and physics simulation is provided by [[Ageia]]'s [[PhysX]] [[physics engine]]. It also uses IDV's [[SpeedTree|SpeedTreeRT]] tree and plant software, [[Bink video|Bink Video Technology]] from [[RAD Game Tools]] for the cutscenes, as well as the [[FMOD|FMOD Sound System]] from Firelight Technologies for sound playback.&lt;ref name="gothic3manual"/&gt;

The game was designed for a minimum system requirement of a 2.0&amp;nbsp;GHz Intel Pentium 4 with 768&amp;nbsp;MB System [[Random-access memory|RAM]]; recommended video cards include an ATI [[X1600]], Nvidia [[GeForce 6800]] series or better if possible.&lt;ref name="gothic3manual"/&gt;

===Post-release===
After a release with many problems and bugs, a dispute between the publisher and developer led to their separation in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluto13.de/docs/PiranhaBytesJoWooD.pdf|title=Piranha Bytes und JoWood gehen getrennte Wege|language=German|website=[[Piranha Bytes]]|date=May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game remained with the last released patch 1.12 in a buggy and unfinished state, and an announced further patch and editor were not finished.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Therefore, the copyright holding publisher Jowood granted access to the [[source code]] to developers from the game community to allow the fans at least take care of the significant problems and bugs themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.jowood.com/showthread.php?t=144237|title=Das Patch-Projekt|language=German|website=[[JoWooD Entertainment]]|date=June 17, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930144752/http://forum.jowood.com/showthread.php?t=144237|archivedate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.jowood.com/html/News/news_details.php?id=898&amp;title=NEWS&amp;bereich=60|title=Gothic 3 Patch – Release Anfang 2008|language=German|website=JoWooD Entertainment|date=December 20, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121112650/http://press.jowood.com/html/News/news_details.php?id=898&amp;title=NEWS&amp;bereich=60|archivedate=January 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerbild.de/artikel/cbs-Aktuell-Demos-Patches-Gothic-3-Fan-Patch-1.6-veroeffentlicht-1270192.html|title=Gothic 3: Fan-Patch 1.6 veröffentlicht|last=Schuldt|first=Rainer|date=February 8, 2008|language=German|website=[[Computer Bild]]|accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In years of voluntary and unpaid work the fan community produced several [[Unofficial patch|community patches]], with an actual iteration version 1.75 released on April 2012.

''Gothic 3'' was a commercial success, with global sales over 500,000 copies by March 2007.&lt;ref name=sales3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/gothic-3-more-than-500000-units-worldwide-sold|title=''Gothic 3'' - More Than 500,000 Units Worldwide Sold|author=GamesIndustry International|date=March 9, 2007|website=Gamesindustry.biz|publisher=Gamer Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20181202031437/http://www.4players.de/4players.php/spielinfonews/PC-CDROM/3266/63163/Gothic_3-500000_verkaufte_Exemplare.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The game received "mixed" reviews, according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; Prior to its release in early October 2006, Gothic 3 was nominated as the best game of E3 by [[IGN]]. Since the release, most concerns have centered on bugs. ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'''s Daniel Wilks commended the game for its "ton of quests, rewards exploration and approachable combat". However, he criticised it for "system hogging, feeling unfinished and atrocious voice acting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Gothic 3|last=Wilks|first=Daniel|magazine=[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]|publisher=[[nextmedia|Next Media Pty Ltd]]|issue=159|date=January 2007|pages=76-77|issn=1320-7458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hipster Whale''' is an [[Australia]]n [[Independent video game development|independent]] [[video game developer]] and [[Video game publisher|publisher]] founded in 20 November 2014 by Andy Sum and Matt Hall, shortly before making the game ''[[Crossy Road]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adcolony.com/blog/2015/01/16/publisher-spotlight-hipster-whale/|title=Publisher Spotlight: Hipster Whale - AdColony|work=AdColony}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also created the games ''[[Shooty Skies]]'', ''[[Pac-Man 256]]'' (in collaboration with [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]]), and ''[[Crossy Road|Disney Crossy Road]]'' (in collaboration with [[Disney Interactive Studios]]).

==History==
[[File:Crossy Road Gameplay.png|thumb|201x201px|''Crossy Road'' gameplay|left]]After meeting at GCAP (Game Center: Asia Pacific) 2013, Andy Sum and Matt Hall decided to make Hipster Whale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossyroad.com/press/|title=Crossy Road Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name came from discussing [[Free-to-play|free-to-play games]] and the word "[[high roller|whale]]" came up in the conversation. Sum was doodling as they were talking and began drawing a whale, which would later become the company's logo. Sum and Hall kept the whale as the mascot for later on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redbull.com/us/en/games/stories/1331701011749/crossy-road-hipster-whale-interview&lt;/ref&gt;

Hipster Whale's first game, ''Crossy Road'' was planned to take a total of 6 weeks. But after seeing its potential, the developers spent more than 12 weeks developing it. ''Crossy Road'' was inspired by linear movement games (modern successors to classic [[platform games]])such as ''[[Temple Run]]'', ''[[Flappy Bird]]'', ''[[Disco Zoo]]'', ''[[Frogger]]'', ''[[Skylanders]]'', ''[[Tiny Wings]]'', ''[[Subway Surfers]]'', and ''[[Fez (video game)|Fez]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KlickTock/status/538471575838674945|title=Matt Hall|work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name and concept of the game is based on the joke "[[Why did the chicken cross the road?]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/macman/more-than-fun-and-games-with-local-developers-20150304-13usxe|title=More than fun and games with local developers|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2015, [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] and Hipster Whale announced ''[[Pac-Man 256]]'', which featured [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]] trying to escape ghosts and overcome a glitch while performing the same mechanics as the [[Pac-Man|1980 video game]], with the glitch based on the [[Pac-Man#Kill screen|Level 256 glitch]] from the original arcade game,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://toucharcade.com/2015/05/22/pac-man-256-crossy-road/|title='Pac-Man 256' by Hipster Whale is 'Pac-Man' Meets 'Crossy Road'|last=Dotson|first=Carter|date=22 May 2015|work=TouchArcade|access-date=15 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with upgrades and [[freemium]] [[Microtransaction|purchases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kotaku.com/endless-pac-man-is-really-fun-even-though-you-can-neve-1725723440|title=Pac-Man 256 Is Endless Pac-Man With A Fun, Glitchy Twist|last=Hamilton|first=Kirk|date=21 August 2015|work=[[Kotaku]]|access-date=15 September 2016|via=[[Univision Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 August, the game was released, with the game then being released on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on 22 June 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/06/22/pac-man-256-is-munching-endless-pellets-on-ps4-xbox-one-and-steam-right-now/|title=Pac-Man 256 is munching endless pellets on PS4, Xbox One, and Steam|last=Wilson|first=Jason|date=22 June 2016|work=[[VentureBeat]]|access-date=15 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Hipster Whale announced a spin-off of ''Crossy Road'', ''[[Disney Crossy Road]]'', which would be published by [[Disney Interactive Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://creative.vic.gov.au/news/2016/disney-and-hipster-whale-announce-new-game|title=Disney and Hipster Whale Announce New Game|last=|first=|date=17 March 2016|website=|publisher=Creative Victoria|access-date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 July, the company announced its move into [[Video game publisher|video game publishing]], and appointed former [[Atari]] and [[Krome Studios Melbourne]] employee Clara Reeves as the [[President (corporate title)|President]] of Hipster Whale, who recently worked at [[Film Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-07-20-crossy-road-studio-hipster-whale-expands-into-publishing|title=Crossy Road studio Hipster Whale expands into publishing|last=Brightman|first=James|date=20 July 2016|work=Gamesindustry.biz|access-date=15 September 2016|via=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September, the company released an update towards ''Disney Crossy Road'', which added ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' characters to the game and a mode called the "Weekend Challenge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mobipicker.com/disney-crossy-road-guide-monster-inc/|title=Disney Crossy Road Guide – Monster Inc.

'''Georgian Film Studio''' ({{lang-ka|ქართული ფილმი}} Georgian Film; {{lang-ru|Грузия-фильм}}) is one of world's oldest film studios that has produced 800 feature, made-for-TV and short films, 600 documentaries, and 300 animation movies. During Soviet times, the studio was one of the most active places for film production. Having grown organically from the merger of several film production companies that operated in the beginning of the twentieth century in Tbilisi, the studio had been renamed several times before becoming Georgian Film (Gruziya-Film in Russian) in 1953. Sitting on 9.75 hectares (24 acres) of prime land in Tbilisi, Georgian Film Studios offers several sound stages, recording and editing facilities, various production services, modern equipment and professional crews. Georgian Film was founded in 1921 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollberg|first=Peter|title=Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Cinema|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cuw1vHuxITYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA274,M1|year=2008|pages=274&amp;ndash;277|isbn=0-8108-6072-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8119">'''Media meshing''' is the process of using one of the [[Mass media|media]], such as a [[blog]] or a [[website]], to enhance the experience of another medium, such as a newspaper article or a fictional television program.&lt;ref name='clickz2005'&gt;[http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3515526 Media Meshing: An Evolution in Media Consumption], Pete Lerma, [[clickZ]], 2005-Jun-28, retrieved 2007-Apr-14&lt;/ref&gt;  "Meshing" may describe activities and motivations of an information receiver which are completely independent of the intentions of the source of that information.  "Meshing" may also be used to describe the activities of an information provider, who may intentionally encourage consumer engagement by using multiple media or channels of information exchange related to a product or organization, as in an integrated [[advertising campaign]].  Strictly, in both cases, "media meshing" ultimately describes the ''behaviour'' of the person ''receiving'' the information.

When the meshing of media sources is encouraged by the source itself, as is often the case with commercial products and special interest promotions, media meshing may be better described as [[integrated media]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integratedmedia.org/nav.cfm?cat=15&amp;subcat=116&amp;subsub=126 Integrated Media Association] retrieved 2007-Apr-14&lt;/ref&gt; This describes the activity desired by commercial entities when they encourage web traffic through non-web media such as billboards or newspaper articles in a comprehensive [[advertising campaign]].&lt;ref name='clickz2006'&gt;[http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3623563 American Express' Media Meshing], Pete Lerma, [[clickZ]], 2006-Oct-03, retrieved 2007-Apr-14&lt;/ref&gt;

However, from the perspective of the information [[consumer]], Lerma describes that meshing represents a way to experience media which is fundamentally different from the way people interacted with mass media in the past.  When the participants themselves choose the channels, pieces, sources, and specific media that they use to enhance or disassemble the first piece of media they encounter, especially when these are perceived to be mostly independent sources, the result is an enriched self-discovery experience with a level of engagement not possible from even the most well designed guided experiences.  Meshing goes beyond simply [[mutually inclusive public relations]] across media channels, pieces, and [[product placement]]. [[Broadband]] technology and diversity of online services have increased the accessibility and prevalence of simultaneous media experiences to the point where some would argue there is a new, more demanding and more inquisitive, incarnation of information [[consumer]]s.&lt;ref name='omd2005'&gt;[http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san&amp;s=29314&amp;Nid=13055&amp;p=301415 Yahoo!: Internet Users 'Mesh' Web With Television] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227064523/http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san |date=2007-02-27 }} Wendy Davis, 2005-Apr-19, retrieved 2007-Apr-14&lt;/ref&gt;  The richness of experience in meshing becomes even more evident when information receivers puts their new views and interpretations back into the media by posting or answering questions on a discussion forum or blog, publishing a formal in-depth response, or creating an independent fan site.  In cases like these, the persons may be called information [[prosumer]]s, as they are both consuming information from various sources and producing a web of related information for other "meshers" to ''consume'' (or ''prosumers'' to mesh).

&lt;!-- these next statements are carefully constructed to be true, using weasle words I admit, but are important concepts in this article, and I think, could be substantiated by an expert in information and knowledge and media --&gt;
It is arguable, however, that this is the traditional approach of historians and scientists to information sources, and that what is new is the speed and ease with which cross-referencing and elaboration can be achieved with the media delivery and display technology that is used, and the amount of time invested in multi-source research by the non-specialized population.  It is also arguable that multi-form/multi-source information gathering only "seems" new when contrasted to the recent era of single-voice and non-interactive commercial television and radio information broadcasting.  It is also important to note that if the sources are not chosen carefully to be as [[orthogonal]] as possible, media meshing will result in a false reassurance of the "facts" presented by the single-voice of the original articles, but it would still technically be media meshing (i.e., confirming a [[CNN]] television story about an event in London by meshing the [[CNN.com]] web-site, [[BBC]] radio, and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper will probably confirm the original facts, but a different set of facts may be forthcoming from an email to a friend who lives there or from reading a blog from a beat-cop in the area.)

==Engagement==

{{quote|''Using the Web in this fashion--dubbed "media meshing" by the report--"fulfills a need to become more deeply involved with hobbies, interests or stories that kindle passionate involvement," states the report.''|Wendy Davis, Online Media Daily &lt;ref name='omd2005'/&gt;}}

{{quote|''...the Yahoo/mediaedge:cia research shows people with broadband don't necessarily make big shifts in their [[media consumption]] in terms of time spent. Instead, they change how they use other forms of media in conjunction with the Internet. They use the Internet to maximize their engagement with other media.''|Pete Lerma, clickZ &lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt;}}

==Advertising==
{{quote|''Producers retain their shows interactive rights and integrate "experience triggers" into them''|Pete Lerma, clickZ &lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt;}}

==Activities==
The following activities, while perhaps not unique to media meshing, are characteristic of this type of 'enhanced' media consumption
* look up Web sites related to TV programming &lt;ref name='omd2005'/&gt;
* look up Web sites mentioned on TV ads &lt;ref name='omd2005'/&gt;
* take part in online polls mentioned on television &lt;ref name='omd2005'/&gt;
* access more than one type of media simultaneously &lt;ref name='omd2005'/&gt;
* ''Communicating'' becomes ''socializing''&lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt; - email, instant chat and online communities bring families and friends together in real ways, replacing other forms of socializing
* ''Sound bites'' become ''full stories''&lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt; - a five-second headline on the evening news turns into four hours of deep multi-source coverage and 14 hours of discussion online
* ''Just for fun'' becomes ''personal entertainment''&lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt; - try correcting a few pages in Wikipedia for fun, for example
* read stories in magazines and newspapers, then go online to get multiple angles on the same stories &lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt;
* watch a reality TV show, then go online to get character bios, behind-the-scenes information &lt;ref name='clickz2005'/&gt;&lt;ref name='omd2005'/&gt;

== Examples==
&lt;!-- caution, this should not be a link-farm or directory [[WP:NOT#DIR]] I think we would like a small number of good examples or anecdotes, preferably with good Wikipedia articles about them. If you find a really good example, perhaps consider replacing a poorer example if it makes the same point. --&gt;
* In news, using [http://en.wikinews.org WikiNews] and Wikipedia together to investigate, confirm, and gain a deeper understanding of broadcast news stories from a commercial or publicly funded source

'''Mixamo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɪ|k|s|ə|m|oʊ}}) is a [[3D computer graphics]] technology company. Based in San Francisco, the company develops and sells web-based services for [[3D model|3D character]] animation. Mixamo's technologies use [[machine learning]] methods to automate the steps of the character animation process, including [[3D modeling]] to rigging and [[3D animation]].

Mixamo is spun-off of [[Stanford University]] and has raised over $11 million from investors [[Granite Ventures]], Keynote Ventures, Stanford University and [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD Ventures]].&lt;ref name=venturebeat1&gt;{{cite news |title=Mixamo debuts Fuse character creation tool on Steam using Valve’s Team Fortress 2 characters |author=Dean Takahashi |date=November 7, 2013 |publisher=Venture Beat |url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/11/07/mixamo-debuts-fuse-character-creation-tool-on-steam-using-valves-team-fortress-2-characters/ |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixamo was acquired by [[Adobe Systems]] on June 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unlocking The Power of 3D for The Creative Community – Adobe Acquires Mixamo «  Adobe Creative Cloud|url = https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/unlocking-the-power-of-3d-for-the-creative-community/|website = blogs.adobe.com|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mixamo was founded in 2008 by Stefano Corazza and Nazim Kareemi as a spin-off of Stanford University's Biomotion Lab,&lt;ref name=venturebeat1/&gt;&lt;ref name=techcrunch1&gt;{{cite news |title=Mixamo Is Building A Platform For Game Developers To Create And Animate 3D Characters |author=Kim-Mai Cutler |date=July 23, 2014 |publisher=Tech Crunch |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/23/mixamo/ |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started out as a cloud-based service offering animations and automatic character rigging.&lt;ref name=cgworld1&gt;{{cite news |title=Evolving Characters |author=Kathleen Maher |date=May 21, 2014 |publisher=Computer Graphics World |url=http://www.cgw.com/Press-Center/In-Focus/2014/Evolving-Characters.aspx |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It launched its first online animation service in 2009. In 2010, Mixamo worked with Evolver to provide characters to customers.&lt;ref name=cgworld1/&gt; Later [[Autodesk]] acquired Evolver and made it proprietary, but Mixamo had already begun work on its own character creation service.&lt;ref name=cgworld1/&gt;

Mixamo released its automatic rigging service in 2011. That was followed by the launch of its real-time facial animation product, Face Plus, in 2013,&lt;ref name=technewsworld&gt;{{cite news |title=Face Plus Gives Digital Characters Heart and Soul |author=Rachelle Dragani |date=August 29, 2013 |publisher=TechNews World |url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/78767.html |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the official launch of its Fuse 3D character creator software in March 2014.&lt;ref name=developonline&gt;{{cite news |title=Mixamo launching Fuse 1.0 |author=Craig Chapple |date=March 12, 2014 |publisher=Develop Online |url=https://www.develop-online.net/news/mixamo-launching-fuse-1-0-next-week/0190316 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Mixamo launched a new pricing structure.&lt;ref name=cgworld2&gt;{{cite news |title=Mixamo Offers New Pricing Structure |date=August 20, 2014 |publisher=Computer Graphics World |url=http://www.cgw.com/Press-Center/News/2014/Mixamo-Offers-New-Pricing-Structure.aspx |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuse==
[[File:Fuse Character Creator Carousel.png|thumb|right|Models created with Fuse.]]
In March 2014, Mixamo officially launched [[Fuse Character Creator]] at [[Game Developers Conference]].&lt;ref name=developonline/&gt; Fuse stems out of the research done by Siddhartha Chaudhuri&lt;ref&gt;[http://vladlen.info/publications/probabilistic-reasoning-for-assembly-based-3d-modeling/ Siddhartha Chaudhuri]&lt;/ref&gt; which originated within Vladlen Koltun's research group at Stanford and Substance technology from Allegorithmic.&lt;ref name=slashgear&gt;{{cite news |title=Mixamo Fuse universal expendable 3-D character creator launches on Steam |author=Shane McGlaun |date=November 8, 2013 |publisher=SlashGear |url=http://www.slashgear.com/mixamo-fuse-universal-expendable-3-d-character-creator-launches-on-steam-08304713/ |accessdate=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early version of the service had been released in November 2013.&lt;ref name=gamasutra2013&gt;{{cite news |title=Fuse adds easy character creation to Steam |author=Kris Ligman |date=November 8, 2013 |publisher=Gamasutra |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/204434/Fuse_adds_easy_character_creation_to_Steam.php |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It allows users to create a 3D character by assembling customizable body parts, clothing and textures together.&lt;ref name=gfxspeak&gt;{{cite news |title=Mixamo builds out to end to end products, adds upgrade in time for GDC |author=Kathleen Maher |date=March 12, 2014 |publisher=GraphicSpeak |url=http://gfxspeak.com/2014/03/12/mixamo-products-upgrades/ |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those characters can then be exported into other [[3D modeling|3D model]] software packages or [[game engines|game engine]].&lt;ref name=gfxspeak/&gt; In March 2014, Mixamo launched Fuse 1.0 on Steam with the ability of importing and integrating user generated content in the character creation system.&lt;ref name=cinemablend&gt;{{cite news |title=Mixamo Releases Fuse, Character Creation Tool On Steam |author=William Usher |date=March 30, 2014 |publisher=Cinema Blend |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Mixamo-Releases-Fuse-Character-Creation-Tool-Steam-63079.html |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuse was updated to allow the importation and editing of character models generated by Microsoft's Kinect 2.0 in August of that year.&lt;ref name=gamasutra2014&gt;{{cite news |title=Mixamo's Fuse makes modeling people easier with Kinect v2 support |author=Alex Wawro |date=August 7, 2014 |publisher=Gamasutra |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/222858/Mixamos_Fuse_makes_modeling_people_easier_with_Kinect_v2_support.php |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rigging service==
Mixamo also provides an online, automatic model rigging service known as the Auto-Rigger, which was the industry's first online rigging service. The AutoRigger applies machine learning to understand where the limbs of a 3D model are and to insert a "skeleton", or rig, into the 3D model as well as calculating the skinning weights. The service can take up to 2 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development/digging-into-rigging-mixamos-character-service-explored|title=Digging into rigging: Mixamo's character service explored|work=MCV|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==3D Character Animation==
Mixamo's online services include an animation store featuring downloadable 3D models and animation sequences. The animations were created at Mixamo using [[motion capture]] and cleaned up by key frame animators. All its animations work with characters created in Fuse and/or rigged with Mixamo's AutoRigger.

==Real-time facial animation==
[[File:Unplugged real-time animated short.png|thumb|right|Screenshot from "Unplugged": real-time facial animation from single camera and blendshape animation running in [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] game engine.]]

August 2013, Mixamo released Face Plus, a [[game development tool]] that allows users to record [[facial animation]] data of themselves using a standard webcam and apply the animation to a character inside the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] [[game engine]] in real-time.&lt;ref name=technewsworld/&gt;&lt;ref name=tropicalpost/&gt; Face Plus was briefly included in the keynote presentation at the Unite conference in Vancouver. The technology was developed in collaboration with [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]].&lt;ref name=gfxspeak/&gt; and uses [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] acceleration.&lt;ref name=tropicalpost&gt;{{cite news |title=Generate realistic Animation using Mixamo’s Face plus |date=September 6, 2013 |publisher=TropicalPost |url=http://tropicalpost.com/generate-realistic-animation-using-mixamos-face-plus/ |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animated short "Unplugged" was created using Face Plus technology and as of April 2014 has won several awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://bestshorts.net/?page_id=163&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''MotoGP '07''''' is the fifth game in [[THQ]]'s MotoGP series for [[Xbox 360]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[mobile phone]]s (the latter released as '''''MotoGP 4'''''). The purchase of the [[Black Rock Studio|Climax Racing]] studio, developer of most of the previous titles in the series, from Climax Studios by [[Disney Interactive Studios]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061008173035/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=146839]&lt;/ref&gt; led to speculation over who would be developing the game. However, a promo video on the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] confirmed that Climax Studios were still involved in ''MotoGP '07''.

==Features==
''MotoGP '07'' features complete rider and team data, new 800[[Cubic centimetre|cc]] [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]] bikes and all 18 circuit of the [[2007 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2007 MotoGP season]]. The title also features interactive track-side crowds, on-line tournament features, on-line "[[Vehicle title|pink slip]]" racing, and a revamped Extreme mode.  The revamped Extreme mode allows for over one million possible bike customizations.

In addition, minor gameplay changes have been made to the [[Car handling|handling]] and [[Brake|braking]] to allow for easier player accessibility. Changes to [[acceleration]] and [[Acceleration|deceleration]] have been made to add to the realism which will make turns easier to navigate through. Slight [[fishtailing]] with hard braking has been put in to give a better feel for the handling of the bike and to let the player know how effective their braking is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brudvig |first=Erik |date=March 2, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/02/motogp-07-hands-on |title=MotoGP '07 Hands-On |publisher=IGN |accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the ability of the player to customise their bikes is greatly increased. In Extreme mode the player can upgrade their bike with various performance modifications: carbon brakes, race exhausts, magnesium/carbon wheels etc. In Grand Prix mode, the customisation is limited to visual upgrades, though ''MotoGP'07'' now allows players greater control over the appearance of their bike. Despite this, some players have complained that the visual modifications are still fairly restrictive - the main criticism is that the custom paintwork option still restricts the player to the same limited amount of customisation as the previous games, despite the fact that the overall visual modification option has been overhauled. This leaves the player unable to design or customise the paint on their bike to approximate the level of design detail achieved by other AI racers.. Whether this issue will be resolved in future patches is not known.

In addition to this the PC version of the game features a corrupt model of the Yamaha M1 with the rear cowling misformed visible on Rossi and Edwards' bikes. Also the crowds in grandstands no longer work with post 2010's graphics drivers on the PC and shimmer.

===Ilmor GP===

The game features Ilmor GP to ride but In real life Ilmor rider Jeremy McWilliams crashed before the first Round of the season in Qatar, resulting in him not Being able to take part in the race. Andrew Pitt, the second Rider, raced alone. However, Ilmor GP does not appear in more races since Ilmor retired from the 2007 Championship after the first GP in Qatar.

However, Jeremy McWilliams and Andrew Pitt and the Ilmor GP bike are available to use as a playable driver and bike in the championship mode and race mode and in the quick races

In championship mode, the Ilmor GP team was removed to avoid running against them,

In sports race, you can use the Ilmor GP team to customize it and play with it but like the championship mode, the Ilmor GP team is removed and we will not be able to race against them.

In quick race, one rider IA will be replaced random for Andrew Pitt, since the game only has 19 bikes at a time, 20 bikes for the sports race mode.

==Release==
''MotoGP '07'' had a somewhat protracted release in the United Kingdom. While the Xbox release proceeded as planned, the PC version was delayed twice: originally delayed until the first week of September, and then delayed again until the eventual release date of September 28.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12880">'''Musical hallucinations'''  fall under the category of [[auditory hallucinations]] and describe a disorder in which a sound is perceived as instrumental music, sounds, or songs. It is a very rare disorder, reporting only 0.16% in a cohort study of 3,678 individuals.&lt;ref name ="Evers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Evers |first=S |author2=Ellger, T |title=The clinical spectrum of musical hallucinations |journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences |year=2004 |volume=227 |issue=1 |pages=55–65 |pmid=15546592 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2004.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of disorder ==
In 73 individual cases reviewed by Evers and Ellger, 57 patients heard tunes that were familiar, while 5 heard unfamiliar tunes. These tunes ranged from religious pieces to childhood favorites, and also included popular songs from the radio. Vocal and instrumental forms of classical music were also identified in some patients. Keshavan found that the consistent feature of musical hallucinations was that it represented a personal memory trace. Memory traces refer to anything that may seem familiar to the patient, which indicate why certain childhood or familiar songs were heard.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Keshavan" /&gt;

== Causes ==
Investigators have successfully narrowed down the major factors that are associated with musical hallucinations. Evers and Ellgers compiled a significant portion of musical hallucination articles, case studies etc. and were able to categorize five major etiologies:

* [[Hypoacusis]]
* [[Musical hallucinations#Psychiatric disorders|Psychiatric disorders]]
* [[Focal brain lesion]]
* [[Epilepsy]]
* [[Substance intoxication|Intoxication]]

=== Hypoacusis ===
Hypoacusis is defined as impairment in hearing or deafness. Hypoacusis is one of five etiologies of musical hallucinations, and is the most common in the case studies reviewed by Evers and Ellgers.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt; According to Sanchez et al. 2011, there have been suggestions that pontine lesions could alter the central auditory system's function causing hypoacusis and musical hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Hammeke"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hammeke |first=TA |author2=McQuillen, MP |author3=Cohen, BA  |title=Musical hallucinations associated with acquired deafness |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |year=1983 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=570–2 |pmid=6875592 |pmc=1027453 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.46.6.570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanchez"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sanchez |first=TG|author2=Rocha, SC |author3=Knobel, KA |author4=Kii, MA |author5=Santos, RM |author6= Pereira, CB  |title=Musical hallucination associated with hearing loss |journal=Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria |year=2011 |volume=69 |issue=2B |pages=395–400 |pmid=21625772 |doi=10.1590/s0004-282x2011000300024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychiatric disorders ===
A case study by Janakiraman et al. 2006, revealed a 93‑year‑old woman with [[major depressive disorder]] who experienced musical hallucinations while treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT). Investigators found that the patient's depression symptoms were inversely related to her hallucinations and primarily stemmed from the ECT treatment.  The patient had no known abnormalities in hearing, suggesting that musical hallucinations could arise from a variety of sources including psychiatric illnesses. After a complete course of ECT, her hallucinations dissipated, also suggesting that they can be acute.&lt;ref name="Janaki"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janakiraman |first=R |author2=Wildgoose, K |author3=Seelam, K  |title=ECT associated musical hallucinations in an elderly patient: a case report |journal=Annals of General Psychiatry |year=2006 |volume=5 |pages=10 |pmid=16889667 |doi=10.1186/1744-859X-5-10 |pmc=1557851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Evers and Ellgers, some other major psychiatric disorders that contribute to musical hallucinations include [[schizophrenia]] and depression. Some patients who have schizophrenia experience musical hallucinations due to their ongoing psychosis, but there are some cases that do so without psychosis. There are also a very small percentage of musical hallucination cases due to [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD).&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;

=== Focal brain lesions ===
Among the handful of cases that Evers and Ellgers studied, major lesion sites included the temporal cortex; however, the specific location and laterality (left vs. right temporal cortex) was variable. Many cases of focal brain lesions had comorbidity with hearing impairment (see hypoacusis), epileptic activity and intoxication.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt; There have also been several findings of acute musical hallucinations in patients with dorsal [[pons]] lesions post-stroke and [[encephalitis]] potentially due to disruption of connections between the [[sensory cortex]] and [[reticular formation]].&lt;ref name="Schielke"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schielke |first=E |author2=Reuter, U |author3=Hoffmann, O |author4= Weber, JR  |title=Musical hallucinations with dorsal pontine lesions |journal=Neurology |year=2000 |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=454–5 |pmid=10932294 |doi=10.1212/wnl.55.3.454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epilepsy ===
Epileptic brain activity in musical hallucinations originates in the left or right temporal lobe.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt; In a specific case studied by Williams et al. 2008, a patient who received a left temporal lobectomy in order to treat epilepsy was diagnosed with musical hallucinations post-surgery. The patient also had multiple additional risk factors that could have accounted for the hallucinations including mild neuropsychiatric dysfunction and [[tinnitus]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=VG |author2=Tremont, G |author3=Blum, AS  |title=Musical hallucinations after left temporal lobectomy |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology |year=2008 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=38–40 |pmid=18327022 |doi=10.1097/WNN.0b013e318165a9e1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intoxication ===
Intoxication accounts for a small percentage of musical hallucination cases. Intoxication leads to either withdrawal or inflammatory encephalopathy, which are major contributors to musical hallucinations. Some of the drugs that have been found to relate to musical hallucinations include salicylates, benzodiazepines, pentoxifylline, propranolol, clomipramine, amphetamine, quinine, imipramine, a phenothiazine, carbamazepine, marijuana, paracetamol, phenytoin, procaine, and alcohol.  General anesthesia has also been association with musical hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;
In a case study by Gondim et al. 2010, a seventy–seven-year-old woman with [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) was administered [[amantadine]] after a year of various other antiparkinsonian treatments. Two days into her treatment, she started to experience musical hallucinations, which consisted of four musical pieces. The music persisted until three days after cessation of the drug. Although the patient was taking other medications at the same time, the timing of onset and offset suggested that amantadine either had a synergistic effect with the other drugs or simply caused the hallucinations. Although the case wasn't specific to intoxication, it leads to the idea that persons with PD who are treated with certain drugs can experience musical hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Gondim"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gondim |first1=Francisco de Assis Aquino |last2=Costa |first2=Helida A. |last3=Taunay |first3=Tauily C.D. |last4=de Oliveira |first4=Gisele R. |last5=Ferreira |first5=Jamile Magalhães |last6=Rola |first6=Francisco H. |title=Transient amantadine‑induced musical hallucinations in a patient with Parkinson’s disease |journal=Movement Disorders |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2010 |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1505–1506 |pmid=20629118 |doi=10.1002/mds.22553 |issn=0885-3185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imaging ==
[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) show that musical hallucinations activate a wide variety of areas in the brain including the following: auditory areas, [[motor cortex]], visual areas, [[basal ganglia]], [[brainstem]], [[pons]], [[tegmentum]], [[cerebellum]], [[Hippocampus|hippocampi]], [[amygdala]], and peripheral auditory system.&lt;ref name="Sacks" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
To date, there is no successful method of treatment that "cures" musical hallucinations. There have been successful therapies in single cases that have ameliorated the hallucinations. Some of these successes include drugs such as neuroleptics, antidepressants, and certain anticonvulsive drugs. A musical hallucination was alleviated, for example, by antidepressant medications given to patients with depression.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt; Sanchez reported that some authors have suggested that the use of hearing aids may improve musical hallucination symptoms.&lt;ref name="Sanchez" /&gt; They believed that the external environment influences the auditory hallucinations, showing worsening of symptoms in quieter environments than in noisier ones.&lt;ref name="Hammeke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=TC |author2=Crosby, TW |title=Musical hallucinations in a deaf elderly patient |journal=Annals of Neurology |date=Mar 1979 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=301–2 |pmid=443762 |doi=10.1002/ana.410050314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Elliott D. |title=Musical Hallucinations in Deafness |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |date=1975-02-10 |volume=231 |issue=6 |pages=620 |doi=10.1001/jama.1975.03240180056018 |pmid=1172847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Sacks' patient, Mrs. O'C, reported being in an "ocean of sound" despite being in a quiet room due to a small thrombosis or infarction in her right temporal lobe. After treatment, Mrs. O'C was relinquished of her musical experience but said that, "I do miss the old songs. Now, with lots of them, I can't even recall them. It was like being given back a forgotten bit of my childhood again." Sacks also reported another elderly woman, Mrs. O'M, who had a mild case of deafness and reported hearing musical pieces. When she was treated with anticonvulsive medications, her musical hallucinations ceased but when asked if she missed them, she said "Not on your life."&lt;ref name="Sacks1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |title=The man who mistook his wife for a hat and other clinical tales |year=1998 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-684-85394-9 |edition=1st Touchstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
According to [[Oliver Sacks]]' ''[[Hallucinations (book)|Hallucinations]]'', the first known medical report of musical hallucinations was published in 1846, by French alienist Jules Baillarger.&lt;ref name="Sacks"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |title=Hallucinations |year=2012 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-95724-5 |edition=1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first scientific description of the disorder was reported in the early 1900s. In the last two decades, Berrios has reported case studies in 1990 and 1991 along with Keshavan et al. in 1992. Berrios concluded that confirmed diagnoses of deafness, ear disease, brain disease, advanced age and drug use are all important factors in the development of musical hallucinations. After analyzing 46 cases, Berrios found a female predominance of 80% in women over the age of 60. The study concluded that musical hallucinations were more likely to be seen in elderly women affected by deafness or brain disease than in individuals with no psychiatric illness at all.&lt;ref name ="Berrios"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berrios |first=GE |title=Musical hallucinations. A historical and clinical study |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |year=1990 |volume=156 |issue=2 |pages=188–94 |pmid=2180526 |doi=10.1192/bjp.156.2.188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keshavan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keshavan |first=M.S. |author2=David, A.S. |author3=Steingard, S. |author4=Lishman, W.A.  |title=Musical hallucinations: a review and synthesis |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology |year=1992 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=211–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keshevan and Berrios were the first authors to identify classes of musical hallucinations. These classes consisted of hearing loss, coarse brain disease (i.e. tumors), [[epilepsy|epileptic disorder]], [[stroke]], and psychiatric disorder. Although no statistical analyses were performed, the authors stated that deafness was the most strongly related factor in musical hallucinations and that there was a female predominance, which could entail a genetic component.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berrios" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Keshavan" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9735">'''Nordic popular music''', also referred to as '''Scandipop''', are known for its biggest bands like [[ABBA]], [[Roxette]], [[a-ha]] and [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]]. These are by far the biggest non-metal acts to come out of [[Music of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Music of Norway|Norway]] and [[Music of Denmark|Denmark]]. 

The popular music of the [[Nordic countries]] exhibits great diversity. [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] have all had successful domestic record industries for many years. Because the [[Baltic countries]] of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] were under Soviet control for much of the 20th century, when recording technology and popular music spread across the world, those three countries have a more tenuous connection with the popular industries of Finland, Sweden and the rest. However, since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], Western popular music in general has gained audiences in the Baltic states; this includes popular music from the other Nordic nations, as well as the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]] and elsewhere.

The Nordic [[metal music|metal]] scene is highly visible compared to other genres from the region. Many big names such as [[Opeth]], [[Meshuggah]], [[Children of Bodom]] and [[Amon Amarth]] hail from Nordic nations. Nordic or Scandinavian metal bands have had a long and lasting influence on the metal subculture alongside their counterparts in Great Britain and The United States.

'''''Plug''''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] comics magazine that ran for 75 issues from 24 September 1977 until 24 February 1979, when it merged with ''[[The Beezer]]''. It was edited by [[Ian Gray (comics)|Ian Gray]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[[Paul Gravett]], [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/20/guardianobituaries.pressandpublishing "Obituary: Ian Gray"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from ''[[The Bash Street Kids]]'' [[comic strip]] in ''[[The Beano]]'', the comic was based on the character ''Plug'' who was a distinctively ugly member of the Bash Street Kids. His dog (''Pug'') from [[Pup Parade]], and a new character called ''Chunkee the Monkey'' (Plug's pet monkey) accompanied him. [[Vic Neill]] mainly drew the title character's strip. The comic also had its own fan club, the ''Plug Sports and Social Club''. The comic was inspired in part by ''[[Mad Magazine]]''.

The ''Plug'' comic was never a big hit, possibly because, at 9 [[penny|pence]], it was too expensive{{inline-speculation|date=August 2015}} compared to other [[D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd|D.C. Thomson]] comics at the time, which were priced at around 5 pence. According to the 2008 book ''The History of the Beano'', for a while there were rumours of a "curse of ''Plug''", fuelled by the fact that a number of celebrities featured in ''Mad'' magazine-style caricatures on the comic's cover died soon after, most notably [[John Wayne]]. However, the strip's use of gravure painting is still used in comics today.

[[File:Mémoire sur la polyphagie I.jpg|thumb|Baron Percy's original paper on Tarrare's medical history, ''Mémoire sur la polyphagie'' (1805)]]
'''Tarrare''' (c.&amp;nbsp;1772&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1798), sometimes spelled '''Tarare''', was a French showman and soldier, noted for his unusual eating habits. Able to eat vast amounts of meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager. He travelled France in the company of a band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling [[charlatan]]; he would swallow corks, stones, live animals and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to [[Paris]] where he worked as a street performer.

At the start of the [[War of the First Coalition]], Tarrare joined the [[French Revolutionary Army]]. With military rations unable to satisfy his large appetite, he would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. He was hospitalised due to exhaustion and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed eels whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.

General [[Alexandre de Beauharnais]] decided to put Tarrare's abilities to military use, and he was employed as a courier by the French army, with the intention that he would swallow documents, pass through enemy lines, and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination. Tarrare could not speak German, and on his first mission was captured by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] forces, severely beaten and underwent a [[mock execution]] before being returned to French lines.

Chastened by this experience, he agreed to submit to any procedure that would cure his appetite, and was treated with [[laudanum]], tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for [[offal]] in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] with a case of severe [[tuberculosis]], and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of [[exudative diarrhoea]].

==Childhood and early life==
Tarrare was born in rural France, near [[Lyon]], around 1772.&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 203"&gt;{{citation|editor=T. Bradley, Samuel Fothergill &amp; William Hutchinson|title=Polyphagism|journal=London Medical and Physical Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4e0EAAAAQAAJ|volume=42|year=1819|publisher=J.

As a child, Tarrare had a huge appetite and by his teens could eat a quarter of a [[cattle|bullock]], weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day.{{sfn|Lord|1839|p=111}}{{sfn|Good|1864|p=80}} By this time, his parents could not provide for him and had forced him to leave home.&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 203" /&gt;{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}} For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=305}} begging and stealing for food,&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 203" /&gt; before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling [[charlatan]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}}{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=197}} Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other.&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 203" /&gt;{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}} He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of [[Snake#Consumption|snake meat]].&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Pyle" /&gt;{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=197}}

In 1788, Tarrare moved to [[Paris]] to work as a street performer.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}} He appears to have been successful in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he had severe [[intestinal obstruction]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}} Members of the crowd carried him to the [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris|Hôtel-Dieu]] hospital, where he was treated with powerful [[laxative]]s.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}} He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.&amp;nbsp;Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}}{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=197}}

==Appearance and behaviour==
Despite his unusual diet, Tarrare was slim and of average height.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} At the age of 17, he weighed only {{nowrap|100 pounds}} ({{nowrap|45 kg; 7 st 2 lb}}).&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 203" /&gt;{{sfn|Good|1864|p=80}} He was described as having unusually soft fair hair and an abnormally wide mouth, in which his teeth were heavily stained{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} and on which the lips were almost invisible.{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=198}}&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 205"&gt;{{citation|editor=T.

Souter|location=London|page=205.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he had not eaten, his skin would hang so loosely that he could wrap the fold of skin from his abdomen around his waist.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}}{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=198}} When full, his abdomen would distend "like a huge balloon".{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}} The skin of his cheeks was wrinkled and hung loosely, and when stretched out, he could hold twelve eggs or apples in his mouth.&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 205" /&gt;{{sfn|Lord|1839|p=113}} 

His body was hot to the touch and he sweated heavily, he constantly had foul body odour;{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}}&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 205" /&gt; he was described as stinking "to such a degree that he could not be endured within the distance of twenty paces".&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 205" /&gt; This smell would get noticeably worse after he had eaten;{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=198}}&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 205" /&gt; his eyes and cheeks would become bloodshot,{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} a visible vapour would rise from his body,&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 205" /&gt; and he would become lethargic, during which time he would belch noisily and his jaws would make swallowing motions.&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 205" /&gt; He had chronic [[diarrhoea]], which was said to be "fetid beyond all conception".&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 205" /&gt; Despite his large intake of food, he did not appear either to vomit excessively or to gain weight.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=281}} Aside from his eating habits, his contemporaries saw no apparent signs of mental illness or unusual behaviour in him,{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=281}} other than an apparently apathetic temperament with "a complete lack of force and ideas".&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 205" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Cat Eaters"&gt;{{citation|last=Bondeson |first=Jan |date=October 2001 |title=The Cat Eaters |journal=Fortean Times |publisher=Dennis Publishing |location=London |issue=151 |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/260/the_cat_eaters.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521072202/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/260/the_cat_eaters.html |archivedate=2009-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of Tarrare's behaviour is not known. While there are other documented cases of similar behaviour from the period, none of the subjects other than Tarrare were autopsied and there have been no modern documented cases resembling Tarrare.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=312}} [[Hyperthyroidism]] can induce an extreme appetite, rapid weight loss, profuse sweating, heat intolerance, and fine hair. Bondeson (2006) speculates that Tarrare had a damaged [[amygdala]]; it is known that injuries to the amygdala in animals can induce [[polyphagia]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=313}}

==Military service==
On the outbreak of the [[War of the First Coalition]], Tarrare joined the [[French Revolutionary Army]].{{sfn|Lord|1839|p=111}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}} Unfortunately for him, military rations were insufficient to satisfy his appetite.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}} He would carry out tasks for other soldiers in return for a share of their rations and scavenge on the dungheap for scraps,{{sfn|Good|1864|p=80}} but this was not enough to satisfy him.&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 203" /&gt; He was admitted to the military hospital at [[Soultz-Haut-Rhin]] with a case of extreme exhaustion.&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 203" /&gt; He was granted quadruple rations but remained hungry;{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=197}} he would scavenge for garbage in gutters and refuse containers,{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}} eat the scraps of food left by other patients,&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 203" /&gt; and creep into the [[apothecary]]'s room to eat the [[poultice]]s.&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 203" /&gt; Military surgeons could not understand his appetite; Tarrare was ordered to remain in the military hospital to take part in physiological experiments designed by Dr.&amp;nbsp;Courville (surgeon to the 9th Hussar Regiment){{#tag:ref|Some sources give Courville's name as Comville.&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204"&gt;{{citation|editor=T. Bradley, Samuel Fothergill &amp; William Hutchinson|title=Polyphagism|journal=London Medical and Physical Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4e0EAAAAQAAJ|volume=42|year=1819|publisher=J. Souter|location=London|page=204.}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} and George Didier, Baron Percy, surgeon-in-chief of the hospital.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}}

{{Quote box|width=15em|salign=right|quote="The dogs and cats fled in terror at his aspect, as if they had anticipated the kind of fate he was preparing for them"{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}}|source=Baron Percy}}
Courville and Percy decided to test Tarrare's capacity for food. A meal had been prepared for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare in the presence of food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}} Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep;&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Pyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204" /&gt; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=276}}&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204" /&gt; On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Pyle" /&gt;{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=197}} Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten;{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Pyle" /&gt;

===Service as a military courier===
After several months he spent as an experimental case, military authorities began to press for Tarrare to be returned to active duty.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached [[Alexandre de Beauharnais|General Alexandre de&amp;nbsp;Beauharnais]] with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}}&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204" /&gt; Courville proposed to de&amp;nbsp;Beauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}}

Tarrare was called on by Beauharnais to demonstrate his abilities before a gathering of the commanders of the [[Army of the Rhine (France)|Army of the Rhine]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} Having swallowed the box successfully, Tarrare was given a wheelbarrow filled with {{convert|30|lb}} of raw bull's lungs and liver as a reward,&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Pyle" /&gt; which he immediately ate in front of the assembled generals.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}}{{sfn|Lord|1839|p=112}}

Following this successful demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially as a spy of the Army of the Rhine. Although General de&amp;nbsp;Beauharnais was convinced of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, he was concerned about his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße|Neustadt]];{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=277}} he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality de&amp;nbsp;Beauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}}

Tarrare crossed Prussian lines under cover of darkness, disguised as a German peasant.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Unable to speak German,{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=198}} he soon attracted the attention of local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside [[Landau]]. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed,&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204" /&gt; the wooden box emerged.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be de&amp;nbsp;Beauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a [[gallows]] and the noose placed around his neck.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had the presence of mind to recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.){{sfn|Good|1864|p=80}}&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204" /&gt; At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}}

==Attempted cures==
Following this incident, Tarrare was desperate to avoid further military service, and returned to the hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Percy treated him with [[laudanum]] without success; further treatments with [[vinegar|wine vinegar]] and [[tobacco]] pills were likewise unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204" /&gt;{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=278}} Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-[[boiled egg]]s, but this also failed to suppress his appetite.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for [[offal]] outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Pyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204" /&gt;{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing [[bloodletting]], and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Pyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204" /&gt;{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a [[lunatic asylum]], but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}}

After some time, a 14-month-old child disappeared from the hospital, and Tarrare was immediately suspected. Percy was unable or unwilling to defend him, and the hospital staff chased Tarrare from the hospital, to which he never returned.&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204" /&gt;{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}}

==Death==
Four years later, in 1798, a M.&amp;nbsp;Tessier of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] hospital contacted Percy to notify him that a patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could find some way to remove it. Percy, however, recognised that he had advanced [[tuberculosis]].{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} A month later, Tarrare began to experience continuous [[exudative diarrhoea]], dying shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}}

The corpse rotted quickly; the surgeons of the hospital refused to dissect it.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} Tessier, however, wanted to find out how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}} At the autopsy, Tarrare's [[gullet]] was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach.{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=280}} His body was found to be filled with [[pus]],&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204" /&gt; his [[liver]] and [[gallbladder]] were abnormally large,&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204" /&gt; and his stomach was enormous, covered in [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]]{{sfn|Millingen|1839|p=198}} and filling most of his abdominal cavity.&lt;ref name="LMPJ1919 204" /&gt;{{sfn|Bondeson|2004|p=279}}

The fork was never found.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=310}}

'''''The Cliffhanger: Edward Randy''''', known in [[Japan]] simply as {{nihongo|'''''Edward Randy'''''|エドワードランディ|edowādo randi}}, is a side-scrolling [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[arcade game]] released in [[Japan]] by [[Data East]] in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]].

==History==
The game is set in a [[steampunk]] (or, rather, [[dieselpunk]]) worldview, where many scenes and settings are directly modeled after ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', including a whip-wielding main character, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-like enemy army, and battles that take place on [[biplanes]], as well as boats in a [[Venice]]-like location. The game also contains parodies or homages to works by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and [[Buster Keaton]]. The game also uses a movie-like effect where upcoming in-game events are previewed in the game's background.

==In-game description==

===Plot===
The game takes place during the 1930s in an unspecified European country. Research on a secret weapon of mass destruction was being conducted in this country under the leadership of a fearsome army general, the ''Dark Ogre'', but an elderly scientist decides to escape after learning that he was being manipulated by the general. The scientist gives the key piece of his research, a prism stone, to his granddaughter ''Charlotte'' as he escapes, and the general pursues the prism with the full force of his army. Charlotte takes refuge in the home of ''Edward Randy'', a teenage boy who was preparing for his first date in half a year with his girlfriend, ''Jennifer'', while Edward suddenly finds himself in the midst of a huge adventure involving a dangerous plan to destroy the world.

===Gameplay===
[[Image:Thecliffhanger edwardrandy screenshot.png|left|thumb|Screenshot of ''The Cliffhanger: Edward Randy''.]]

The player controls the main character using an 8-way joystick and 2 buttons, one for attacking and one for jumping. The main character attacks using a whip, and he can attack in 8 different directions depending on the direction pressed on the joystick. He can also slide on the ground when the jump button is pressed while the joystick is pressed to the side or diagonally downwards. Pressing the joystick diagonally upwards causes the character to run quickly, and pressing down on the joystick while the character is in the air allows him to stomp on enemies on the ground. The character can also do a spin-attack by looping their whip on other objects and holding left or right on the joystick. The character is invincible while they are spinning, but can only spin 4 times per attack.

The game is completed when the player finishes all 7 levels, and up to 2 players can play together at a time. There are no lives in the game, and the main character's remaining health is directly linked to the number of points gained by the player on each level. The player can revive the main character's health by killing more enemies, and they lose points along with health when they are hit by enemy attacks. The player is taken to the game over screen when their points (health) reaches 0. Therefore, the high score is calculated as the highest number of points the player had at any point in the game rather than the number of points they have at the end of the game.

The game's story-line is explained in demo screens that appear in-between levels. The level's subtitle is displayed before the start of each level.

'''''The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made'''''&lt;!--This is the title as written on the cover and inside, as well as in book listings online. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE IT WITHOUT A REASON.--&gt; is a  2013 [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Greg Sestero]] and [[Tom Bissell]]. Sestero details the troubled development and production of the 2003 cult film ''[[The Room (film)|The Room]],'' his own struggles as a young actor, and his relationship with ''Room'' director [[Tommy Wiseau]].&lt;ref name=LAT1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruland|first1=Jim|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-greg-sestero-tom-bissell-20130929-story.html|title=Worst movie ever? 'The Disaster Artist' explores 'The Room'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017|date=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, a [[The Disaster Artist (film)|film adaptation of the same name]] was released, directed and produced by and starring [[James Franco]] as Wiseau, with his brother and co-producer [[Dave Franco]] in the role of Sestero.

==Synopsis==
Sestero, an aspiring actor struggling with confidence, first encounters Wiseau in an acting class. Sestero is at first perplexed by Wiseau's over-the-top acting technique, his unusual physical appearance, his unidentifiable accent and his eccentric behavior, which includes a fascination with all things American and a refusal to discuss his past. At the same time, Sestero admires Wiseau's boldness and his genuine enthusiasm for both life and acting. The two form an odd but affectionate bond as Sestero begins to learn of the many contradictions of Wiseau's personality.

As Sestero slowly accrues more acting credits and makes other friends, Wiseau grows jealous and schemes to earn similar acknowledgement (such as earning a [[SAG card]] by producing and starring in a commercial for a company he himself owned), leading Sestero to become uncomfortable with their relationship. After viewing ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' for the first time, Sestero is struck by how similar Wiseau is to the title character and convinces him to see the film. However, instead of recognizing his own behavior, Wiseau is deeply impressed by the performance and becomes obsessed with creating a movie just as emotionally powerful. The result is the screenplay for ''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]'', which includes a character, Mark, named after actor [[Matt Damon]] (whose name Wiseau had misheard).

Backed by a seemingly endless, mysterious supply of money, Wiseau develops, produces, directs and stars in ''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]'', despite having no knowledge of filmmaking. On-set relationships are a disaster: the story itself is nonsensical and full of plot threads that are never addressed or resolved (a matter complicated by Wiseau refusing to give anyone a full copy of the script); Wiseau's camera set-up requires two full crews to operate, actors and crew storm off the set, scripts are rewritten in the middle of scenes, sets are broken down only to be rebuilt and re-shot the following day, and at the last possible moment, Wiseau convinces Sestero to join the crew as one of the principal actors, in spite of the role already having been cast. By the end of shooting, the cast and crew, convinced that the film will never be seen, lose their enthusiasm, resulting in lackluster performances and technical blunders that are never corrected.

Sestero screens a rough cut of the film for his friends and family, who are enthralled by its bizarre ineptitude. Their reaction turns out to be prophetic when, eight months later, Wiseau secures a release for the film, beginning its cult reputation as "the ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' of [[list of films considered the worst|bad movies]]". The book ends with Sestero's meditation on the power—and danger—of unconditional belief in one's dreams.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|The Disaster Artist (film)}}
A film adaptation [[The Disaster Artist (film)|of the same name]], directed and co-produced by and starring [[James Franco]] as Wiseau and [[Dave Franco]] as Sestero, premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 12, 2017, and was released in the United States on December 1, 2017.

Sestero's impression of Wiseau in the audiobook has received praise from critics, including ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' and [[Publishers Weekly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartsell|first1=Carol|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/27/greg-sestero-tommy-wiseau-impression_n_5399103.html|title=Listen To Greg Sestero's Awesome Tommy Wiseau Impression In This 'Disaster Artist' Audioclip|work=[[HuffPost]]|accessdate=December 6, 2015|date=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Disaster Artist'' audiobook was named a finalist for the 2015 [[Audie Awards]] for Best Humor Audiobook.&lt;ref name="audie"&gt;{{cite web|title=20th Annual Audie finalists announced in thirty categories|url=https://www.audiopub.org/uploads/pdf/2015_Audie_Awards_Release.pdf|publisher=[[Audio Publishers Association]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017|date=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In March 2014, ''The Disaster Artist'' (Audiobook) won for ''Favorite Non-Fiction Book of 2013'' at [[Bookish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallucci|first1=Kelly|title=Oscar-Style Nominations For Our Favorite Books of 2013|url=https://www.bookish.com/articles/oscar-style-nominations-for-our-favorite-books-of-2013/|publisher=[[Bookish]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017|date=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, 2014, ''The Disaster Artist'' won for Best Non-Fiction at the National Arts &amp; Entertainment Journalism Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The judges praised the book, stating "''The Disaster Artist'' is not only a hell of a good read, it will make a great film if ever adapted. It's equal parts ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', ''[[American Hustle]]'' and demented ''[[Citizen Kane]]''—with a dash of [[Monty Python]] thrown into the mix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Winners - 7th National Arts &amp; Entertainment Journalism Awards|url=http://lapressclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2014-National-Arts-Entertainment-Journalism-Award-Winners.pdf|publisher=[[Los Angeles Press Club]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Trophy''', originally known as the '''Helms Award''', was an annual sporting award established by the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]] in 1939 to honour the foremost amateur athlete of each continent of the world, including Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, North America, and South America.&lt;ref name=olympic&gt;{{cite journal|title=Helms Athletic Foundation|url=http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1951/BDCE25/BDCE25n.pdf|journal=Bulletin du Comite International Olympique|date=1951|issue= 25|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the Foundation was established in 1936, the awards date back to the 1896, the year of the first [[Summer Olympics]]. Australasian awards for 1896 to 1949 were decided by a Committee in [[Australasia]] established by the Foundation. Members of the Committee were [[Frank Beaurepaire|Sir Frank Beaurepaire]] (Chairman), and Messrs. [[Harold Alderson|Harold G. Alderson]], [[Hugh Weir|Hugh R. Weir]], [[Jack Metcalfe]], Frank H. Pizzey, [[Hector de Lacy]], [[Ern Cowley]] and R.J.  McPherson (Secretary).

Winners were presented with a silver plaque and had their names added to the World Trophy that was located at the Helms Foundation and subsequently the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles (now known as the [[LA84 Foundation]]).&lt;ref name=pollard/&gt; Winners can only win the award once.&lt;ref name=pollard/&gt;

It is designed to enable a user propelled by [[gravity]] to travel from the top to the bottom of the inclined cable by holding on to, or attaching to, the freely moving pulley.  Zip-lines come in many forms, most often used as a means of entertainment.  They may be short and low, intended for child's play and found on some [[playground]]s.  Longer and higher rides are often used as a means of accessing remote areas, such as a [[rainforest]] [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]]. Zip line tours are becoming popular vacation activities, which are found at outdoor adventure camps or upscale resorts, where they may be an element on a larger challenge or [[ropes course]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mauimagazine.net/Maui-Magazine/September-October-2008/Dont-Look-Down/|title=Don't Look Down!|last=Thayer|first=Matthew|date=September–October 2008|magazine=Maui No Ka ‘Oi magazine|accessdate=9 March 2011|location=Maui, Hawaii|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126151202/http://www.mauimagazine.net/Maui-Magazine/September-October-2008/Dont-Look-Down/|archivedate=26 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The jungles of [[Costa Rica]], [[Florida]], [[Puerto Vallarta]], and [[Nicaragua]] are popular destinations for zip line enthusiasts.

==History==
The zip-wire has been used as a transportation method in some mountainous countries for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/01/aerial-ropeways-automatic-cargo-transport.html|title=Aerial ropeways: automatic cargo transport for a bargain|publisher=LOW-TECH MAGAZINE, Doubts on progress and technology|accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some remote areas in China such as [[Salween River|Nujiang (Salween)]] valley in [[Yunnan]], zip lines served the purposes of bridges across rivers, but due to a poor safety record, they have mostly been replaced by real bridges by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gokunming.com/en/blog/item/3444/bye_bye_nujiang_ziplines|title=Bye-bye Nujiang ziplines|publisher=GoKunming|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as "an inclined strong",&lt;ref&gt;See the second paragraph here [http://www.enotes.com/invisible-man-wells-text/chapter-x-mr-marvels-visit-to-iping] where the phrase is underlined.&lt;/ref&gt; one appears in ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]], published in 1897, as part of a Whit-Monday fair.

In 1739, [[Robert Cadman]], a [[steeplejack]] and [[Tightrope walking|ropeslider]], died when descending from [[Shrewsbury|Shrewsbury's]] [[St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury|St Mary’s Church]] when his rope snapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pis&amp;GRid=3976&amp;PIgrid=3976&amp;PIcrid=638945&amp;PIpi=78262&amp;|title=Find A Grave - Millions of Cemetery Records|author=|date=|website=www.findagrave.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] used a direct ancestor of the zip-line in spring 1906 for a method of testing various characteristics of his [[Santos-Dumont 14-bis]] [[Aviation in the pioneer era|pioneer era]] [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] biplane, before it ever flew under its own power later that year.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In the Australian [[outback]], zip-lines were occasionally used for delivering food, cigarettes or tools to people working on the other side of an obstacle such as a gully or river. Australian troops have used them to deliver food, mail and even ammunition to forward positions in several conflicts.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Flying fox==

The term "flying fox" is most commonly used in reference to a small-scale zip line typically used as an item of [[child]]ren's [[Play (activity)|play]] equipment, except in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] where it also refers to professional forms of zip-line equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ziplinerider.com/Australia_Ziplines.html

With the flying fox, the [[Pulley|pulley(s)]], attached to the car, are fixed to the cable.  The car itself can consist of anything from a simple hand grip, with the user hanging underneath, to a bucket for transporting small items, to a quite elaborate construction, perhaps including a seat or a safety strap. Children's versions are usually not set up with a steep incline, so the speeds are kept relatively low, negating the need for a means of stopping.

To be propelled by gravity, the cable needs to be on a fairly steep slope. Even then the car will generally not travel completely to the end (although this will depend on the [[Structural load|load]]), and some means of safely stopping the car at the bottom end is sometimes needed. It can be returned by several means, either by simply pushing the car back to the top of the hill on foot (as is common in children's play equipment as they do not hang far from the ground) or a line leading from the car to the uphill end.

The flying fox is usually made with rope instead of steel cable to make it easier and cheaper to install, uninstall and transport.  Riders on the Flying Fox need [[safety harness]] to get support on the zip line.

==Professional courses==
Professional versions of a zip-line are most typically used as an outdoor adventure activity. In contrast to "flying foxes" professional courses are usually operated at higher speeds, covering much longer distances and sometimes at considerable heights. The users are physically attached to the cable by a [[safety harness|harness]] that attaches to a removable [[zip line trolley|trolley]]. A [[helmet]] is required on almost all courses of any size.

Cables can be very high, starting at a height of over {{convert|9|m|abbr=on}}, and traveling well over {{convert|460|m|abbr=on}}.  All zip-line cables have some degree of sag. The proper tensioning of a cable is important and allows the ability to tune the ride of a zip line.

Zip lines are a common way to return participants to the ground at the end of a ropes adventure course.

[[File:Zip line spring braking system.jpg|thumb|Zip-line spring braking system]]

=== Braking ===

Users of zip-lines must have means of stopping themselves. Typical mechanisms include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roper|first1=Aaron|title=Zip Line Braking Methods|url=http://help.ziplinegear.com/entries/22964583-Zip-Line-Braking-Methods|website=ZipLineGear Knowledge Base|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Friction created between the pulley against the cable.
* Thick, purpose-built leather gloves.
* A mat or netting at the lower end of the incline.
* A passive arrester system composed of [[spring (device)|springs]], pulleys, [[counterweight]]s, [[bungee cord]], [[tire]] or other devices, which slows and then stops the trolley's motion.
* A "capture block" which is a block on the cable that is tethered to a rope controlled by a staff who can manually apply friction on the rope to slow the user down. 
* Gravity stop, exploiting the sag in the cable. The belly of the cable is always lower than the termination point. The amount of incline on a zip line controls the speed at which the user arrives at the termination point.
* Hand brake at the end of the zip line.

=== Safety ===

With proper knowledge and training on the part of the operators, along with good maintenance, zip lines are generally safe and easy to use. In 2012 there were an estimated 200 commercial zip lines in the US and a further 13,000 private ones resulting in 3,600 visits to the emergency room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zipline-related injuries are rapidly increasing|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/10/151005080118.htm|accessdate=7 October 2015|work=[[Science Daily]]|date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zip-line trolley==
[[File:Departure zip SuperFly in Whistler, BC, Canada.jpg|thumb|Departure zip SuperFly in Whistler, BC, Canada]]

The zip-line trolley is the frame or assembly together with the pulley(s) also known as sheave(s) inside that run along the cable. (The term "trolley" is more often used when this assembly consists of more than a single pulley with simple hanger and bearing.) Often more than one pulley is used to spread the load over more than one spot on the cable, to reduce cable bending stresses that may lead to metal fatigue and cable breakage. This also reduces any tendency of a pulley to twist sideways and run off the cable, with disastrous results. In addition, the trolley is usually shaped with guards to hold the cable in the groove(s) of the pulley(s).

A pivoting link, such as a [[carabiner]], is used to secure the load to the trolley so that the trolley does not have a tendency to rock and thus fall off the cable if the load should sway. Load carriers ranging from enclosed cabins to gondolas to harnesses are attached to the link. Occasionally the load carrier is just a handhold or handlebar, although there is the danger of the rider losing his grip and falling. Such a simple carrier should be used only on zip lines that are near the ground or over water. The rider losing his grip due to the use of the simple carrier has led to a number of deaths.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

'''''Zorns Lemma''''' is a 1970 American [[structural film|structural]] [[experimental film]] by [[Hollis Frampton]]. Originally starting as a series of photographs, the [[non-narrative film]] is structured around a 24-letter [[Latin alphabet]]. It remains, along with [[Michael Snow]]'s ''[[Wavelength (1967 film)|Wavelength]]'' and [[Tony Conrad]]'s ''[[The Flicker]]'', one of the best known examples of structural filmmaking.

==Content==
The opening section of ''Zorns Lemma'' is 5 minutes long. In it a woman reads an [[abecedary]] of 24 couplets from ''The Bay State Primer'', an eighteenth century book designed to teach children the alphabet.&lt;ref name="gidal-october"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gidal |first=Peter |year=1985 |title=Interview with Hollis Frampton |journal=[[October (journal)|October]] |issue=32 |pages=93–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is entirely black during this section.

[[File:Zorns Lemma letter A.png|thumb|left|A letter ''A'' stamped on tin foil, the first of 24 such letters shown at the beginning of the second section]]
The film's main section is silent and lasts 45 minutes, broken into 2,700 one-second units. It shows the viewer an evolving 24-part "alphabet". The section begins by presenting each letter typed on a sheet of tin foil.&lt;ref name="gidal-october"/&gt; The alphabet is initially composed of words that appear on street signs, photographed in [[Manhattan]]. As the film continues to cycle through the alphabet, individual letters are slowly substituted with images. The first four substitutions—fire (''x''), waves (''z''), smoke (''q''), and reeds (''y'')–depict the four [[classical elements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weiss |first=Allen S. |year=1985 |title=Frampton's Lemma, Zorn's Dilemma |journal=[[October (journal)|October]] |issue=32 |pages=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bershen |first=Wanda |date=September 1971 |title='Zorns Lemma' |journal=[[Artforum]] |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's conclusion lasts 10 minutes. It shows a man, woman and dog walking through snow. During this scene, six women's voices alternate in reading the words of a passage from ''[[On Light, or the Ingression of Forms]]'' by [[Robert Grosseteste]].&lt;ref name="gidal-october"/&gt; The voices read at a rate of one word per second.&lt;ref&gt;Sitney 2002, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Zorns Lemma'' emerged from ''Word Pictures'', a photography project that Frampton made from 1962 to 1963.&lt;ref name="phillips-october"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=Christopher |year=1985 |title=Word Pictures: Frampton and Photography |journal=[[October (journal)|October]] |issue=32 |pages=62–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Word Pictures'', Frampton shot over 2000 black-and-white [[35 mm format|35mm]] photographs of environmental words, seeking to explore the illusions of photography as a medium.&lt;ref name="gidal-october"/&gt; However, he had difficulty devising a form in which to present the photographs. During this period, Frampton became less active as a photographer and first started to experiment with filmmaking.&lt;ref name="phillips-october"/&gt; He started to make a film by shooting the photographs on a stand but thought the result looked "dead", deciding that he should film the words in color.&lt;ref name="frampton-criterion"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Hollis Frampton|Frampton, Hollis]] |year=2012 |section=Remarks by Frampton |title=A Hollis Frampton Odyssey |medium=DVD |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began filming static shots of words, carefully framing them with the use of a [[tripod (photography)|tripod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zryd |first=Michael |year=2004 |title=History and Ambivalence in Hollis Frampton's ''Magellan'' |journal=[[October (journal)|October]] |issue=109 |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frampton thought that imposing his own order on the film would make it too similar to a poem, so he decided to use alphabetical order and avoid any conscious connections between words. Because the number of times he had captured each letter varied greatly, he decided to use the "double alphabet" and continuously cycle through the letters.&lt;ref name="frampton-criterion"/&gt; This structure left "holes" to be filled in the film.&lt;ref name="frampton-criterion"/&gt; Frampton decided to gradually substitute out the letters for images, originally planning to use entirely different images each time.&lt;ref name="gidal-october"/&gt; Frampton's production notes outline three criteria for selecting the images used. He preferred banal images, with the exception of animals included for "shock value". He preferred "sculptural" images showing work or the "illusion of space or substance". These included painting a wall (''k'') and changing a tire (''t''). Frampton worked in "cinematic or para-cinematic reference", often subtly so. The letter ''d'' is substituted with cookie dough being sliced with a star-shaped cookie cutter, as a cinematic reference to film "stars". Modular actions—such as a child swinging (''l'') or assembling [[Tinkertoy]]s (''r'')—serve as para-cinematic references to modular time.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald 1995, pp. 61–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Frampton set the length of each shot to be one second, or 24 frames. However, 24 of the shots have slight irregularities in their lengths. Frampton instructed [[key grip]] David Hamilton that 12 shots should have 23 frames and 12 shots should have 25 frames.&lt;ref&gt;Frampton 2009, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final section of ''Zorns Lemma'' was shot in 1970.&lt;ref name=frampton76&gt;Frampton 1976, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Frampton envisioned it as a time for the audience "to empty the mind".&lt;ref name="frampton-criterion"/&gt; When loading and unloading the film rolls, he intentionally exposed them to sunlight and created reel-end flares to emphasize "the materiality of film".&lt;ref name=frampton76/&gt;

Frampton's films are often titled after specialized scientific disciplines, as in the case of ''Maxwell's Demon'', ''Prince Rupert's Drops'', and ''Hapax Legomena''.&lt;ref&gt;Sitney 2002, pp. 369–370.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s minimalist artist [[Carl Andre]] described to Frampton the [[Dedekind cut]], which partitions a totally ordered set into a set with no [[maximal element]] and a set with no minimal element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ragona |first=Melissa |year=2004 |title=Hidden Noise: Strategies of Sound Montage in the Future of Hollis Frampton |journal=[[October (journal)|October]] |issue=109 |pages=96–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became interested in the relationship between [[set theory]] and film while working on his ongoing project ''Magellan''. Frampton titled ''Zorns Lemma'' after [[Zorn's lemma]] (also known as the Kuratowski–Zorn lemma), a proposition of set theory formulated by mathematician [[Max Zorn]] in 1935. Zorn's lemma describes [[partially ordered set]]s where every [[totally ordered]] subset has an upper bound. The letters and images in ''Zorns Lemma'' are sets whose order is discovered during the course of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Sitney 2002, pp. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoberman]] wrote that it "drove the audience mad",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/hollis-frampton-at-anthology-here-there-everywhere-6389326 |title=Hollis Frampton at Anthology: Here, There, Everywhere |last=Hoberman |first=J. |authorlink=J. Hoberman |date=March 25, 2009 |website=[[The Village Voice]] |access-date=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Howard Thompson (film critic)|Howard Thompson]] observed that "never, at least so far during the Film Festival, have so many Philharmonic Hall viewers slithered outside for a cigarette."&lt;ref name="thompson-nyt"/&gt; Nevertheless, the sale of ''Zorns Lemma'' was a financial success for Frampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tuchman |first=Mitch |year=1985 |title=Frampton |journal=[[Film Comment]] |volume=21 |issue=4 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Amos Vogel]] called ''Zorns Lemma'' a "radical example of reductive cinema" that warned of "things to come&amp;nbsp;... 'meaning' (political, psychological, personal, or whatever) has been eliminated and the work exists purely for itself, demanding attention to structure, pattern, and orchestration."&lt;ref&gt;Vogel 1974, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described the film as "a thoroughly demanding but highly stimulating exercise in heightening our awareness of the possibilities of visual perception and, indeed, the ways in which we create meaning itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Kevin |date=October 8, 1974 |title=A Progression of Images |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=E9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental filmmaker [[Ernie Gehr]] stated, "''Zorns Lemma'' is a major poetic work. Created and put together by a very clear eye, this original and complex abstract work moves beyond the letters of the alphabet, beyond words and beyond [[Freud]]."&lt;ref name="hollisframpton.org"&gt;[http://hollisframpton.org.uk/zornslemma.htm ''Zorns Lemma'' at HollisFrampton.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have interpreted [[Stan Brakhage]]'s 1972 film ''The Riddle of Lumen'' as a response to ''Zorns Lemma''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Michelson |first=Annette |authorlink=Annette Michelson |year=1985 |title=Frampton's Sieve |journal=[[October (journal)|October]] |publisher= |issue=32 |pages=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sitney 2008, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Peter Greenaway]] has cited the film as an influence on his work, based on its illustration of how to "structure a film without necessarily using narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hagen |first=Charles |year=1990 |title=Peter Greenaway and the Erotics of Form |journal=[[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture]] |issue=121 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenaway's 1973 short film ''H Is for House'' presents long lists of words beginning with the letter ''h'', and his later feature films ''[[The Draughtsman's Contract]]'' and ''[[A Zed &amp; Two Noughts]]'' feature children reciting abecedaries.&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Su Friedrich]] adapted the structure of ''Zorns Lemma'' for her 1990 film ''[[Sink or Swim (1990 film)|Sink or Swim]]''. Originally intending to represent each letter of the alphabet with multiple words, Friedrich ultimately used a 26-segment structure that moves in reverse alphabetical order.&lt;ref&gt;Sitney 2008, pp. 309–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Zorns Lemma'' received three critics' votes in the 2012 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' polls of the world's greatest films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ded348a/sightandsoundpoll2012|title=Votes for Zorns Lemma (1970)|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
