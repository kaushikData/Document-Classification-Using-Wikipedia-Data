'''Artur Immanuel Hazelius''' (30 November 1833 &amp;ndash; 27 May 1901) was a Swedish teacher, scholar,  [[folklore|folklorist]] and museum director. He was the   founder of both the [[Nordic Museum]] (''Nordiska museet'') and the [[Skansen]]  [[open-air museum]] in [[Stockholm]].

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nordicmuseum.org/about |title=About the Nordic Museum |publisher = Nordiska museet |accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hazelius was born in Stockholm, Sweden as the son of  Johan August Hazelius (1797-1871), an [[Swedish Army|Army officer]] (with terminal rank of [[generalmajor|major general]]), politician and publicist. He entered [[Uppsala University]] in 1854, and received his Ph.D. degree in 1860, after which he worked as a teacher, as well as participating in several school-book and language reform projects.
[[File:Arthur Hazelius juni 2015.jpg|thumb|250 px| Bust of Artur Hazelius at Skansen]]
In 1869 Artur Hazelius was the secretary of the Swedish section at the Scandinavian [[orthography|orthographic]] congress in Stockholm (''det nordiska rättstavningsmötet''), and published its proceedings in 1871. The radical reforms in Swedish spelling proposed there sparked opposition from the [[Swedish Academy]].  This gave Johan Erik Rydqvist (1800–1877) the energy to publish ''[[Svenska Akademiens Ordlista]]'' (SAOL),  the very conservative 1st edition of the Academy's one volume spelling dictionary in 1874. However, many of the proposals from the congress were introduced in the 6th edition of the same dictionary in 1889 (e-ä, qv-kv) and the rest (dt, fv, hv) in a spelling reform for Swedish schools, introduced in 1906 by the minister of education [[Fridtjuv Berg]] (1851–1916). Berg acknowledged that Hazelius had laid the foundation for all following spelling reforms.

==Career==
[[File:Hazeliushuset beskrivelse.JPG|thumb|250 px|Plaque at Skansen]]
During travels in the country, Hazelius noticed how Swedish folk culture, including architecture and other aspects of the material culture, was eroding under the influence of industrialization, migration and other processes of modernity, and in 1872 he decided to establish a museum for Swedish ethnography, originally (1873) called the Scandinavian ethnographic collection (''Skandinavisk-etnografiska samlingen''), from 1880 the [[Nordiska museet|Nordic Museum]] (''Nordiska Museum'', now ''Nordiska museet''). In 1891 he established the open-air museum [[Skansen]], which became the model for other open-air museums in Northern Europe. He got the idea after a visit to the world's first open-air museum, [[Norwegian Museum of Cultural History|Norsk Folkemuseum ]] established near [[Oslo]] in 1881.
&lt;ref name="snl"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://snl.no/Norsk_Folkemuseum|title=  Norsk Folkemuseum|publisher=Store norske leksikon|author=   Anne-Sofie Hjemdahl|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Nordic museum, Hazelius bought or managed to get donations of objects &amp;ndash; furniture, clothes, toys etc. &amp;ndash; from all over Sweden and the other Nordic countries; he was mainly interested in peasant culture but his successors increasingly started to collect objects reflecting bourgeois and urban lifestyles as well. For Skansen he collected entire buildings and farms.

Although the project did not initially get the government funding he had hoped, Hazelius received widespread support and donations, and by 1898 the Society for the promotion of the Nordic Museum (''Samfundet för Nordiska Museets främjande'') had 4,525 members. The [[Riksdag]], allocated some money for the museums in 1891 and doubled the amount in 1900, the year before his death.

==Personal life==
Hazelius was married to Sofia Elisabeth Grafström (1839-1874), daughter of [[Anders Abraham Grafström]], a historian,  priest and member of the [[Swedish Academy]]. 
During the last few years of his life, Hazelius lived at Hazeliushuset, one of the old buildings on Skansen. He died on the 27 of May 1901, and on 4 February 1902, he was interred in a grave at Skansen.

His only son Gunnar Hazelius (1874-1905) succeeded him as [[curator]] of the Nordic Museum. Gunnar Hazelius's daughter Gunnel Hazelius-Berg  (1905-1997) was later costume and textile historian at the Nordic Museum. Her husband, Professor Gösta Berg (1903-1993) served as director of the Nordic Museum and Skansen from 1956-1963 and managing director of the Skansen Foundation from 1964.

'''Atheistic Dictionary''' ({{lang-ru|Атеисти́ческий слова́рь}}) is a one-volume [[reference]] work devoted to various aspects of [[religion]] and [[atheism]]. It contains more than 2500 terms.

== History of creation ==
The dictionary was the result of many years of cooperation of scientists from various scientific and educational institutions of the [[USSR]] and the socialist countries. It was based on the word list, compiled by the candidate of historical sciences V.F. Zybkovets with V.V. Zybkovets, which has been widely discussed by the scientific community of [[Moscow]], [[Leningrad]] and [[Kiev]] — [[Institute of Scientific Atheism]] Academy of Social Sciences under the CPSU Central Committee and its Kiev branch, Department of history and theory of [[Marxist–Leninist atheism|scientific atheism]], [[Lomonosov Moscow State University|Moscow State University named after Lomonosov]], Department of history and theory of [[Marxist–Leninist atheism|scientific atheism]] [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv|KSU named after Taras Shevchenko]], Department of scientific atheism, ethics and aesthetics [[Herzen University]]. The final wordlist was [[:ru:Яблоков, Игорь Николаевич|I. N. Yablokov]].

In August 2006, RateBeer's annual press-release of the highest rated beers on the site caused concern when various world media reported that supplies of [[Westvleteren Brewery|Westvleteren]] 12 were sold out due to being listed as the "Best beer in the world" on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.celebrator.com/features/westvleteren.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060207032143/http://www.celebrator.com/features/westvleteren.html| archivedate= 2006-02-07| title= Westvleteren : Is The Beer All Gone? | date=

RateBeer has over 4.5 million ratings (as of early 2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ratebeer.com/RateBeerBest/default_2013.asp|title=The Best Beers in the World 2013|website=www.ratebeer.com|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of more than 470,000 beers, from over 26,000 breweries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ratebeer.com/RateBeerBest/default_2016.asp|title=The Best Beers in the World 2015|website=www.ratebeer.com|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, it was revealed that [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] had acquired a minority stake in RateBeer via the incubator ZX Ventures. This purchase led to concerns that the company had a [[conflict of interest]], citing that the site could present bias towards Anheuser-Busch InBev brands, that there was a lack of transparency over the role of the company's investment, and that it could potentially gain access to customer data. Several breweries attempted to demand that their listings be removed from the website. Executive director Joe Tucker stated that "Nothing about this investment changes who we are and what we provide. We will just be able to give our community of beer drinkers an even better experience".&lt;ref name="nyt-inbevrate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Smaller Brewers Relied on RateBeer.com.

Located in Indianapolis, Indiana, '''The Chris Gonzalez Library and Archives''' is a circulating [[LGBT]] libraries in the Midwest. Housed inside the office building of Indy Pride, Inc., the collection currently has over 8,000 titles, a vast archive of local and national LGBT publications, including ''The Mirror Magazine'', ''The Works Magazine'' and the ''Heartland Newspaper'' collections. The library is also the proud recipient of the popular '''Bob and Margaret Green''' drag scene video collection. Other notable items in the [[archive]] is a collection of more than 200 T-shirts from legions of GBLT festivals and parades across the United States, valuable artwork by local artists, LGBT paraphernalia, mementos, and rare GLBT collectibles.

==Creation==
The brainchild of Michael Bohr, a lifelong resident of Indianapolis and graduate of [[Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School]], 1966 and [[Xavier University]], 1970, started the archive in 1993 with the donation of his personal collection, which contained 1,600 books and other memorabilia of gay life in Indianapolis. During the 1980s and 1990s, [[AIDS|Acquired Immune Dificiency Syndrome]] (AIDS) took the lives of many friends of Bohr's, and, thus, served as a catalyst in the creation of the library. Additionally, Bohr's awareness of other GLBT libraries, particularly the [[Gerber/Hart Library]] in Chicago served as inspiration in establishing a [[library]] in his hometown of Indianapolis.

==Collection==
From the beginning, Bohr’s inclination was to collect and preserve the history of gay life in Indianapolis. Thus, by erecting the ''Chris Gonzalez Library and Archives'', it became the place that espouses and commemorates the lives of [[same gender loving]] people and a [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] of GLBT titles and memorabilia for generations to come. Gay and lesbian publications like "''The Mirror"'', ''The Works'' and ''The Screamer'', which is believed to be the city's earliest gay publication&lt;ref name=Higgins/&gt; serve as examples. ''The Screamer'' was published on [[mimeographed]] paper in 1966 and its writers worked [[undercover]] by using [[pseudonyms]].

==Development==
''The Chris Gonzalez Library and Archives'' became a reality in March 1995,&lt;ref name=Penner/&gt; in collaboration with ''Diversity, Inc.'', a now defunct LGBT community center in Indianapolis. While Diversity's focus was on the future, serving as a public identified central clearinghouse&lt;ref name=Penner/&gt; for people who identify as gay, lesbian, [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]], the library's role was to keep a shining light on the past. Between 1997 and 2007, the library went through several changes and a few different sponsors. Indeed, with no other alternatives, the collection was placed in storage for approximately a year. However, Bohr continued seeking additional collections and some were simply donated by people in the community.

In April 2008, [[Indy Pride, Inc.]] forged a relationship with ''The Chris Gonzalez Library and Archives'' and became its sole benefactor.&lt;ref name=Higgins/&gt; Indy Pride, Inc. is a community-based, non-profit organization that seeks to "celebrate and educate others about the rich historical and cultural legacy of [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] peoples."&lt;ref&gt;Indy Pride&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chris Gonzalez==
''The Chris Gonzalez Library and Archives'' was named for Christopher T. Gonzalez, a local supporter and activist of gay and lesbian youth in Indiana. He is credited with establishing the Indiana Youth Group, an award-winning, non-profit organization that caters to gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth. He succumbed to AIDS in April, 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4048">The '''Chronicle of Market Prices''', designated "Chronicle 23" in Grayson’s ''Assyrian and Babylonian chronicles'',&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{ cite book | title = Assyrian and Babylonian chronicles | author = A. K. Grayson | publisher = J. J. Augustin | year = 1975 | pages = 60–62, 178–179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; its first publishing, and Mesopotamian Chronicle 50: “Chronicle of Market Prices” in Glassner’s ''Mesopotamian Chronicles''&lt;ref name=mc&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mesopotamian Chronicles | author = Jean-Jacques Glassner | publisher = Society of Biblical Literature | year = 2004 | pages = 294–297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n Chronicle laconically recording the cost of various commodities from the beginning of the second until the early-mid first millennium BC. The moniker is a modern designation as it had no colophon to identify it in antiquity.

==The text==

It is known from a single fragmentary [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] era copy, now held in the [[British Museum]] with reference BM 48498 (81-11-3, 1209) where only the left-hand side (6.5 x 3&amp;nbsp;cm) of a medium sized tablet remains. The surface is heavily worn, especially on the reverse, and the bottom is also broken off, consequently leaving a gap in the middle of the narrative. The text is subdivided into sections of uneven length apparently devoted to different reigns and ends halfway down the reverse.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{rp|60}}

Providing a brief résumé of commodity prices from sometime prior to the reign of [[Hammurabi|Ḫammu-rapī]] (''ana tar-ṣi Am-mu-ra-pí'', c. 1728–1686 BC, [[short chronology]]) until a period possibly as late as [[Nabu-shuma-ishkun|Nabû-šuma-iškun]] (c. 748 BC), it seems to have been compiled as a prologue to the pricing quoted in the [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]], which seem to have begun immediately after this period, as it shares their phraseology.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Reallexikon der Assyriologie und Vorderasiatischen Archäologie: Klagegesang – Libanon | chapter = Königslisten und Chroniken | author = A. K. Grayson | editor = D. O. Edzard | publisher = Walter De Gruyter | year = 1984 | pages = 88–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other kings whose names are discernible include [[Kurigalzu I]] or [[Kurigalzu II|II]], the ''twenty-first year'' of [[Marduk-apla-iddina I]] or [[Marduk-apla-iddina II|II]] (neither king reigned that long, unless Marduk-apla-iddina II's eight-year interregnum is included),&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Materials and Studies for Kassite History, Vol. I (MSKH I) | chapter = Marduk-apla-iddina I | author = J.

Historian A. K. Grayson favors identification with the earlier two of the homonymous monarchs.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{rp|61 note 7}}

The main products mentioned, barley (&lt;small&gt;ŠE&lt;/small&gt;''-im''), dates (&lt;small&gt;ZÙ.LUM.MA&lt;/small&gt;), sesame (&lt;small&gt;ŠE.GIŠ.Ì&lt;/small&gt;) and wool (&lt;small&gt;SÍG&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ḪI.A&lt;/sup&gt;) were in widespread use as commodities for exchange from the earliest of times. Their sequence follows that of the astronomic diaries,&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{rp|178}} which also include mustard/cuscuta and cress/cardamom whose economic significance developed in the first millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Evolution of Technical Analysis: Financial Prediction from Babylonian Tablets to Bloomberg Terminals | author = Andrew W.

The '''''Chronique romane''''' ("romance chronicle") or '''''Chronicle of Montpellier''''' ({{lang-fr|Chronique de Montpellier}}) is an [[Old Occitan]] and [[Middle French]] [[chronicle]] of the city of [[Montpellier]]. The ''Chronique'' was probably made for the use of town officials, who would have wanted a record of local history for help in administration and in forging civic pride. The recording of town officials, such as council members, was also important, and in two manuscripts the ''Chronique'' is found along with the ''[[Charte de 1204]]'', a compilation of local [[customary law]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Widmayer, "The Chronicle of ''Montpellier H119'': Text, Translation and Commentary," ''The Medieval Chronicle IV'', ed. Erik Kooper (Rodopi, 2006), 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Its annalistic format was typical of civic chronicles of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cf.]] the ''[[Annales Flores]]'' and ''[[Annales Paulini]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
The ''Chronique'' survived in five manuscripts at one point. The [[annals]] of ''Montpellier H119'', now among the ''fonds anciens'' (ancient sources) in the Bibliothèque de la faculté de médecine at Montpellier, cover the entire period 816–1364. The lost manuscript called ''Joubert'', formerly of the [[Bibliothèque Royale]] at [[Paris]], contained only the annals for 1088–1264. The ''Thalamus des archives du roi'' is now also lost, leaving ''Le grand Thalamus de Montpellier'' and ''Le petit Thalamus de Montpellier'',&lt;ref&gt;''Le petit Thalamus'' also contains the final written version (1204/5) of the [[Coutumes de Montpellier]], based on those given [[William VIII of Montpellier|Lord William VIII]] just before his death in 1202.&lt;/ref&gt; which is kept in the municipal archives of Montpellier and covers the years 814–1604. All the manuscripts derive from a single source for they years they have in common. In general ''Le petit Thalamus'' has the most complete entries, though both it and ''Montpellier H119'' were composed "negligently and hastily, with frequent orthographic and historical errors" and differ in the dating of many events.&lt;ref&gt;Widmayer, 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthographic evidence indicates that the manuscript ''Montpellier H119'' is older than ''Le petit Thalamus''. For example, the former spelling "Montpeslier" (from [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] ''Montepestalario'') is preferred in the former where "Montpellier" occurs in the latter. The final year in ''H119'' is 1364, whereas ''Le petit Thalamus'' continues 340 years to 1604. Earlier copies of the chronicle also contained annual lists of town councillors in the same manuscript, but in the late ''Petit Thalamus'' these lists are found in the margin beside their years of the chronicle. The penultimate entry of the ''H119'' chronicle is for 1295, probably the date of its initial completion, since all entries up to that point are written in a thirteenth-century [[Blackletter|Gothic script]]. The possessor of the manuscript in 1364 probably added the final, more [[cursive]], entry himself. ''Le petit Thalamus'' contains many years from between 1295 and 1364, but not 1364 itself.

==Modern editions==
In the sixteenth century one President Philippy, a local official, made a [[Textual criticism|critical edition]] of the text of the ''Thalamus des archives du roi'', but this went unpublished. On the eve of the [[French Revolution]], a Father Pacotte of [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] also tried to edit the chronicle, but it too went unpublished. The Archaeological Society of Montpellier published the first edition of the chronicle, based on ''Le petit Thalamus'', in 1836. In 2006 a critical edition with English translation based on ''Montpellier H119'' was published by Jeffrey S. Widmayer.

==Date and authorship==
The editors of ''Le petit Thalamus'' speculated that the original chronicle, from which all the manuscript versions derive, was begun around 1088, during the reign of [[William V of Montpellier]], and continued by a succession of scribes. The selection of this date is probably due to its being the starting point of the chronicle in the ''Joubert'' manuscript, which is the oldest one. However, in evoking the memory of [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]] (1093–1105), the original scribe erroneously puts him in power at the time of the death of [[Charlemagne]] (814), an unlikely mistake for a contemporary of Raymond's to make. There is no reason the composition could not have begun later.&lt;ref&gt;Widmayer, 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest date of the chronicle is 814, the year of Charlemagne's death, incorrectly thought by the scribe to be 809 years after the [[birth of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;An inherent error in the ''[[anno domini]]'' system means, however, that it was not exactly 814 years after Christ's birth either, but this error was unknown in the Middle Ages.&lt;/ref&gt; The years between 814 and 1134 are only infrequently recorded, and they year 1104 is out of order, but from 1141 the chronicle records multiple entries per year and includes more detail. This may indicate the beginning of the composition. The original scribe may have relied on "vague historical memory" and the collective memory of a city that lived for centuries under the rule of one family, the [[Lords of Montpellier|Guilhems]], to record events prior to his own day.

The authors of the chronicle took an especial interest in miracles and the foundation of religious organisations, but it was unusual for [[cleric]]s of the time to write in the vernacular, unless they were writing for patrons illiterate in Latin.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2015}}
{{italic title}}
The '''''Corpus Juris Canonici''''' ([[Literal translation|lit.]] 'Body of Canon Law') is a collection of significant sources of the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]] that was applicable to the [[Latin Church]]. It was replaced by the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]] which went into effect in 1918. The 1917 Code was later replaced by the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]], the codification of canon law currently in effect for the Latin Church. In 1990, [[Oriental canon law]] was codified in the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]], which is currently in effect for the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].

The ''Corpus juris canonici'' was used in canonical courts of the Catholic Church such as those in each [[diocese]] and in the courts of appeal at the [[Roman Curia]] such as the ''[[Roman Rota]]''.

==Definitions==
The term ''corpus juris canonici'' was used to denote the system of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical law]] beginning in the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, ''Law and Revolution'', pg. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[wikt:corpus|corpus]]'' (Latin for 'body') here denotes a collection of documents; ''corpus juris'', a collection of laws, especially if they are placed in systematic order. It may signify also an official and complete collection of a legislation made by the legislative power, comprising all the laws which are in force in a country or society. The term, although it never received legal sanction in either Roman or canon law, being merely academic phraseology, is used in the above sense when the "Corpus juris civilis" of the Christian [[Roman Emperor]]s is meant.
 
The expression ''corpus juris'' may also mean, not the collection of laws itself, but the legislation of a society considered as a whole. Hence [[Benedict XIV]] could rightly say that the collection of his Bulls formed part of the corpus juris.&lt;ref&gt;Jam fere sextus, 1746&lt;/ref&gt; One best explains the signification of the term ''corpus juris canonici'' by showing the successive meanings which were usually assigned to it in the past and at the present day.
 
Under the name of "corpus canonum" ('body of [[Canon law|canons]]') were designated the collection of [[Dionysius Exiguus]] and the ''Collectio Anselmo dedicata'' (see below). The ''[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]'' of [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] is already called ''Corpus juris canonici'' by a [[glossator]] of the 12th century, and [[Innocent IV]] calls by this name the ''Decretales'' or [[Decretals of Gregory IX]].&lt;ref&gt;Ad expediendos, 9 September 1253&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Since the second half of the 13th century, ''Corpus juris canonici'' in contradistinction to the [[Roman law|Roman]] ''[[Corpus juris civilis]]'' of [[Justinian I]], generally denoted the following collections: the "Decretals" of [[Gregory IX]]; those of [[Boniface VIII]] (Sixth Book of the Decretals); those of [[Clement V]] (Clementinæ) i. e. the collections which at that time, with the ''Decretum'' of Gratian, were taught and explained at the universities.
At the present day, under the above title are commonly understood these three collections with the addition of the ''Decretum'' of Gratian, the ''[[Extravagantes]]'' (laws 'circulating outside' the standard sources) of John XXII, and the ''Extravagantes Communes''.

Thus understood, the term dates back to the 16th century and was officially sanctioned by [[Gregory XIII]].&lt;ref&gt;Cum pro munere, 1 July 1580&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest editions of these texts printed under the now usual title of ''Corpus juris canonici'', date from the end of the 16th century (Frankfort, 8vo, 1586; Paris, fol., 1587).
 
In the strict sense of the word the Church does not possess a ''corpus juris clausum'' ('closed body of law'), i. e. a collection of laws to which new ones cannot be added. The [[Council of Basle]] (Sess. XXIII, ch. vi) and the decree of the Congregation "''Super statu regularium''" (25 January 1848) do not speak of a ''corpus clausum''; the first refers to "''reservationibus in corpore juris expresse clausis''": reservations of ecclesiastical benefices contained in the ''Corpus juris'', especially in the ''[[Liber sextus]]'' of Boniface VIII, to the exclusion of those held in the ''Extravagantes'' described below, and at that time not comprised in the ''Corpus juris canonici''; the second speaks of "''cuilibet privilegio, licet in corpore juris clauso et confirmato''", i. e. of privileges not only granted by the [[Holy See]] but also inserted in the official collections of canon law.

== Jus novum and Corpus juris canonici ==

===Decretum Gratiani===
{{Main|Decretum Gratiani}}

It was about 1150 that Gratian, professor of theology at the [[University of Bologna]] and sometimes believed to have been a [[Camaldolese]] monk, composed the work entitled by himself ''Concordia discordantium canonum'', but called by others ''Nova collectio'', ''Decreta'', ''Corpus juris canonici'', also ''Decretum Gratiani'', the latter being now the commonly accepted name. He did this to obviate the difficulties which beset the study of practical, external theology (''theologia practica externa''), i. e. the study of canon law. In spite of its great reputation and wide diffusion, the ''Decretum'' has never been recognized by the Church as an official collection.

===Extravagantes===
{{main|Extravagantes}}

The general laws of a later date than the "Decree" of Gratian have been called "Extravagantes", i. e. laws not contained in Gratian's ''Decretum'' (''Vagantes extra Decretum''). These were soon brought together in new collections, five of which (Quinque compilationes antiquæ) possessed a special authority. Two of them, namely the third and the fifth, are the most ancient official compilations of the Roman Church (see [[Papal Decretals]]). Among other compilations at the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the 13th century the following deserve special attention: "Appendix concilii Lateranensis III"; the collections known as "Bambergensis" (Bamberg), "Lipsiensis" (Leipzig), "Casselana" (Cassel) "Halensis" (Halle), and "Lucensis" (Lucca), so named from the libraries it which the manuscripts of these collections were found; the collection of the Italian Benedictine Rainerus Pomposianus, that of the English canonist Gilbert (Collectio Gilberti), that of his countryman Alanus, professor at Bologna (Collectio Alani) and that of the Spaniard [[Bernardus Compostellanus Antiquus|Bernard of Compostella]]. But soon the new era of official collections began to dawn.

===Decretales Gregorii IX and beyond===
{{main|Decretals of Gregory IX}}
In 1230 [[Gregory IX]] ordered [[St. Raymund of Pennafort]] to make a new collection, which is called the "Decretals of Gregory IX" (''Decretales Gregorii IX''). To this collection he gave force of law by the Bull "Rex pacificus", 5 September 1234. This collection is also known to canonists as the "Liber extra", i. e. extra Decretum Gratiani. [[Boniface VIII]] published a similar code on 3 March 1298, called the "Sixth Book of the Decretals" ([[Liber Sextus]]), including the ''[[Regulæ Juris]]''. [[John XXII]] added to it the last official collection of Canon law, the "[[Liber Septimus]] Decretalium", better known under the title of "Constitutiones Clementis V", or simply "Clementinæ" (Quoniam nulla, 25 October 1317). Later on the canonists added to the manuscripts of the "Decretals" the most important constitutions of succeeding popes. These were soon known and quoted as "Extravagantes", i. e. twenty constitutions of John XXII himself, and those of other popes to 1484. In the Paris edition of the canonical collections (1499–1505) [[Jean Chappuis]] drew them up in the form since then universally accepted, and kept for the first the name "Extravagantes Joannis XXII", and called the others, "Extravagantes communes", i. e. commonly met with in the manuscripts of the "Decretals" (see Papal Decretals).

==Legal status and structure of codifications==
The "Corpus Juris Canonici" was now complete, but it contained collections of widely different juridical value. Considered as collections, the "Decree" of Gratian, the "Extravagantes Joannis XXII" and the "Extravagantes communes" never had a legal value, but the documents which they contain often do possess very great authority. Moreover, custom has even given to several apocryphal canons of the "Decree" of Gratian the force of law. The other collections are official, and consist of legislative decisions still binding, unless abrogated by subsequent legislation.
 
The collections of Gregory IX (Libri quinque Decretalium) and of Boniface VIII (Liber Sextus) are moreover exclusive. The former, indeed, abrogated all the laws contained in the aforesaid compilations subsequent to the "Decree" of Gratian. Several authors however maintained, but wrongly, that it abrogated also all the ancient laws which had not been incorporated in Gratian. The second abrogated all the laws passed at a later date than the "Decretals" of Gregory IX and not included in itself. Each of these three collections is considered as one collection (collectio una), i. e. one of which all the decisions have the same value, even if they appear to contain antinomies. It is to be noted, however, that, in cases of contradiction, the decisions of the collections of later date invalidate those found in a collection of an earlier date.

The "Decretals" of Gregory IX, those of Boniface VIII and the "Clementinæ' are divided uniformly into five books (''[[liber]]''), the books into titles (''[[Titulus (inscription)|titulus]]''), the titles into chapters (''caput''), and treat successively of jurisdiction (''judex''), procedure (judicium), the clergy (''clerus''), marriage (''connubium''), and delinquencies (''crimen''). The rubrics, i. e. the summaries of the various titles, have the force of law, if they contain a complete meaning; on the other hand, the summaries of the chapters have not this juridical value.

==Manner of statutory citation==
It is customary to quote these collections by indicating the number of the chapter, the title of the collection, the heading of the title, the number of the book and the title. The "Decretals" of Gregory IX are indicated by the letter "X", i. e. extra Decretum Gratiani; the "Sixth Book" or "Decretals" of Boniface VIII by "in VIº" i. e. "in Sexto"; the "Clementines" by "in Clem.", i. e. "in Clementinis". For instance: "c. 2, X, De pactis, I, 35", refers to the second chapter of the "Decretals" of Gregory IX, first book, title 35; "c. 2, in VIº, De hæreticis, V, 2", refers to the second chapter of the "Decretals" of Boniface VIII, fifth book, title. 2; "c. 2, in Clem., De testibus, II, 8", refers to the second chapter of the "Clementines", second book, title 8. If there is only one chapter in a title, or if the last chapter is quoted, these passages are indicated by "c. unic.", and "c. ult.", i. e. "caput. unicum" and "caput ultimum". Sometimes also the indication of the number of the chapters is replaced by the first words of the chapter, as for instance: c. Odoardus. In such cases the number of the chapter may be found in the index-tables printed in all the editions.
 
The "Extravagantes Communes" are divided and quoted in the same manner as the "Decretals", and the collection is indicated by the abbreviation: "Extrav. Commun." For instance: "c. 1 (or unicum, or Ambitiosæ), Extrav. Commun., De rebus Ecclesiæ non alienandis, III, 4", refers to the first chapter (the only chapter) in book III, title 4 of the "Extravagantes Communes". This collection omits the usual "Liber IV" which treats of marriage. The "Extravagantes of John XXII" are divided only into titles and chapters. They are indicated by the abbreviation, "Extrav. Joan. XXII". For instance: "c. 2, Extrav. Joan. XXII, De verborum significatione XIV" refers to the second chapter of the fourteenth title of this collection.

Very soon after the invention of printing editions of the "Corpus Juris", with or without the gloss (comments of canonists) were published. We already mentioned the importance of the Paris edition (1499–1505) for the two collections of "Extravagantes"; it includes the gloss. The last edition with the gloss is that of Lyons (1671).

==Post-Tridentine Revision==
Though the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63) did not order a revision of the text of the canonical collections, [[St. Pius V]] appointed in 1566 a commission to prepare a new edition of the "Corpus Juris Canonici". This commission devoted itself especially to the correction of the text of the "Decree" of Gratian and of its gloss. [[Gregory XIII]] decreed that no change was to be made in the revised text.&lt;ref&gt;"Cum pro munere", 1 July 1580; "Emendationem", 2 June 1582&lt;/ref&gt; This edition of the "Corpus" appeared at Rome in 1582, ''in œdibus populi Romani'', and serves as exemplar for all subsequent editions. The best-known, previous to the 19th century, are those of the brothers Pithou (Paris, 1687), Freiesleben (Prague, 1728) and the Protestant canonist Böhmer (Halle-Magdeburg, 1747). The text of the latter edition differs from that of the Roman edition of 1582, and does not therefore possess practical utility. The edition of Richter (Leipzig, 1833–39) avoids this defect and is valuable for its critical notes. The edition of Friedberg (Leipzig, 1879–81) does not reproduce the text of the Roman edition for the "Decree" of Gratian, but gives the Roman text of the other collections. it is the best and most critical edition.

The '''Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire''' ({{lang-es|Acta de Independencia del Imperio Mexicano|links=no}}) is the document by which the [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]] declared independence from the [[Spanish Empire]]. This founding document of the Mexican nation was drafted in the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] in Mexico City on September 28, 1821, by Juan José Espinosa de los Monteros, secretary of the Provisional Governmental Board.

Three copies of the act were executed. One was destroyed in a fire in 1909. The other two copies are in the Museo Historico de Acapulco [[Fort of San Diego|Fuerte de San Diego]] in Acapulco and in the [[Archivo General de la Nación (Mexico)|General Archive of the Nation]] in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="suracapulco.mx"&gt;{{cite web |title=Resguardó descendiente de Nicolás Bravo una de tres copias del Acta de Independencia. |url=http://suracapulco.mx/archivos/63767|language=ES|dead-url=yes}}{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Generales del Trigarante.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Entry of the [[Army of the Three Guarantees|Trigarante Army]] to [[México City]].]]
On September 27, 1821, eleven years and eleven days after the [[Grito de Dolores]], the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] headed by [[Agustín de Iturbide]] entered Mexico City, concluding the [[Mexican War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=27 de septiembre de 1821 Consumación de la Independencia. |url=http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php/conoce-la-sedena/antecedentes-historicos/sedena/efemerides-del-ejercito-mexicano/septiembre/211-27-de-septiembre-de-1821-consumacion-de-la-independencia |publisher=SEDENA |accessdate=March 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930121352/http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php/conoce-la-sedena/antecedentes-historicos/sedena/efemerides-del-ejercito-mexicano/septiembre/211-27-de-septiembre-de-1821-consumacion-de-la-independencia |archivedate=September 30, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, Iturbide installed the Provisional Governing Board, comprising 38 people. The board was chaired by Antonio Pérez Martínez y Robles, and Juan José Espinosa de los Monteros was secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Discurso de Agustín de Iturbide al instalar la Junta. |url=http://www.biblioteca.tv/artman2/publish/1821_124/Discurso_de_Agust_n_de_Iturbide_al_instalar_la_Jun_296.shtml |publisher=500 años de México en documentos |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=El Ejército Trigarante toma la capital e instituye la Junta Provisional Gubernativa. |url=http://www.memoriapoliticademexico.org/Efemerides/9/27091821.html |publisher=Memoria Política de México |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board immediately elected the five members of the Regency of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proclama de Agustín de Iturbide. |url=http://www.agn.gob.mx/independencia/fichas/Proclama%20de%20Iturbide%20convoca%20instalacion%20Congreso%20Constituyente.html |publisher=Archivo General de la Nación |accessdate=March 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803102530/http://www.agn.gob.mx/independencia/fichas/Proclama%20de%20Iturbide%20convoca%20instalacion%20Congreso%20Constituyente.html |archivedate=August 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13 of the same year, Ramón Gutiérrez del Mazo, the first political chief of Mexico City, distributed a proclamation with the Declaration of Independence so all the people could read it, especially the courts, governors and military authorities, for them to publish it nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bando del Acta de Independencia del Imperio Mexicano...|url=http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php/conoce-la-sedena/antecedentes-historicos/sedena/documentos-historicos/octubre/69-13-oct-1821-bando-del-acta-de-independencia-del-imperio-mexicano-mandado-a-publicar-por-la-soberana-junta-provisional-gubernativa-del-28-sep-1821|publisher=SEDENA|accessdate=March 24, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803231217/http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php/conoce-la-sedena/antecedentes-historicos/sedena/documentos-historicos/octubre/69-13-oct-1821-bando-del-acta-de-independencia-del-imperio-mexicano-mandado-a-publicar-por-la-soberana-junta-provisional-gubernativa-del-28-sep-1821|archivedate=August 3, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting and signing==
On the afternoon of September 28, members of the Board met at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] to draft the Declaration of Independence of the newly independent nation. The resulting two documents were drafted in its final form by Juan José Espinosa de los Monteros, Secretary of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PONEN AL ALCANCE DOCUMENTOS DE LA INDEPENDENCIA. |url=http://www.inah.gob.mx/index.php/boletines/245-acervos/5242-ponen-al-alcance-documentos-de-la-independencia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923185544/http://www.inah.gob.mx/index.php/boletines/245-acervos/5242-ponen-al-alcance-documentos-de-la-independencia |archive-date=September 23, 2011 |dead-url=yes |publisher=Azteca 21 |accessdate=March 24, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acts were signed by 33 of the 38 members of the Board and Iturbide as President of the Regency of the Empire. [[Juan O'Donojú]], last [[List of viceroys of New Spain|Superior Political Chief of New Spain]], Francisco Severo Maldonado, José Domingo Rus, José Mariano de Almanza and Miguel Sánchez Enciso did not sign the documents, but in the acts was written: ''Place of signature Juan O'Donoju'' and later his signature was added in the printed copies.

==Text of the Declaration==

{{quote|Declaration of the independence of the Mexican Empire, issued by its Sovereign Junta, assembled in the Capital on September 28, 1821.

The Mexican Nation, which for three hundred years had neither had its own will, nor free use of its voice, leaves today the oppression in which it has lived.

The heroic efforts of its sons have been crowned today, and consummated in an eternal and memorable enterprise, which a spirit superior to all admiration and praise, out of love and for the glory of its Country started in Iguala, continued, and brought to fruition, overcoming almost insurmountable obstacles.

Restored then this part of the North to the exercise of all the rights given by the Author of Nature and recognized as unalienable and sacred by the civilized nations of the Earth, in liberty to constitute itself in the manner which best suits its happiness and through representatives who can manifest its will and plans, it begins to make use of such precious gifts and solemnly declares by means of the Supreme Junta of the Empire that it is a Sovereign nation and independent of old Spain with which henceforth it will maintain no other union besides a close friendship in the terms prescribed by the treaties; that it will establish friendly relationships with other powers, executing regarding them whatever declarations the other sovereign nations can execute; that it will constitute itself in accordance to the bases which in the [[Plan of Iguala]] and the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] the First Chief of the Imperial Army of the Three Guarantees wisely established and which it will uphold at all costs and with all sacrifice of the means and lives of its members (if necessary); this solemn declaration, is made in the capital of the Empire on the twenty-eighth of September of the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-one, first of Mexican Independence.|}}

===Signatories===
The following is the list of the people who signed the Declaration of Independence, the names are written like in the acts. Juan O'Donoju did not sign but his name was written in the acts. Of the 38 members of the Provisional Governmental Board only 34 signed the document (including the aforementioned firm O'Donoju). The signatures of Francisco Severo Maldonado, José Domingo Rus, José Mariano de Almanza and Miguel Sánchez Enciso did not appear to have suffered a possible impairment due to illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paleografía |url=http://www.agn.gob.mx/independencia/paleografias/Acta%20de%20Independencia%20del%20Imperio%20Mexicano.html |publisher=Archivo General de la Nación |accessdate=March 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624214133/http://www.agn.gob.mx/independencia/paleografias/Acta%20de%20Independencia%20del%20Imperio%20Mexicano.html |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Three Original Documents==
Three originals of the document were created and signed.&lt;ref name="suracapulco.mx"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alaman/&gt;

===Provisional Governmental Board  – 1st Original Declaration===
One copy was given to the Provisional Governmental Board, which was later put on display in the Chamber of Deputies until 1909, when fire destroyed the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Celebra SEGOB los 187 años de la firma del acta de Independencia |url=http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/2008/09/celebra-segob-los-187-anos-de-la-firma-del-acta-de-independencia/ |publisher=Presidencia de la Republica |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bravo/Ruiz de Velasco – 2nd Original Declaration===
The Ruiz de Velasco family were the original owners for 128 years of the Acta de Independencia del Imperio Mexicano de 1821. This document was passed down through generations from [[Nicolás Bravo]].  On August 22, 1987, [[Pedro Ruiz de Velasco|Pedro Ruiz de Velasco de la Madrid]] gave the document as a gift to [[Mexico]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=Donan al Gobierno de Guerrero el Acta de la Independencia|author=Diaz Clave, Enrique|url=http://www.elnoticieroenlinea.com/?p=17631|publisher=Excelsior – El Periodico de la Vida Nacional|accessdate=October 21, 2017|date=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[José Francisco Ruiz Massieu]], [[Governor of Guerrero]], accepted this gift and secured this historical document in the Museo Historico de Acapulco [[Fort of San Diego|Fuerte de San Diego]] in Acapulco in the State of Guerrero.&lt;ref name="suracapulco.mx"/&gt;

===Regency of the Empire – 3rd Original Declaration===
A third copy was given to the Regency of the Empire, which remained at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] and was stolen in 1830. Foreign Minister [[Lucas Alamán]] made this reference about the stolen:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acta de Independencia de México. |url=http://www.tepatitlan.gob.mx/gobierno2010-2012/archivo%20Municipal/boletines/Boletin%20no%207%20Acta%20de%20Independencia.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203005829/http://www.tepatitlan.gob.mx/gobierno2010-2012/archivo%20Municipal/boletines/Boletin%20no%207%20Acta%20de%20Independencia.pdf |archive-date=December 3, 2011 |dead-url=yes |page=1 |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cita|"There is not in the republic another copy (handwritten) that the one in session hall of the Chamber of Deputies, the other was sold by an unfaithful employee to a curious traveler from France."}}

Alamán wanted to get the record during his tenure as [[Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|foreign minister]] but failed even when he offered a lot of money for it.

Decades later, the act was acquired by [[Emperor of Mexico|Emperor]] [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]], although it is unknown how and where he got it. The act contains in the back the figure of the ex libris of Maximilian's library.  After Maxilian's execution, Agustin Fischer, confessor of the emperor, took the document out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Afirman que el Acta de Independencia guarda buen estado. |url=http://www.informador.com.mx/cultura/2010/228517/6/afirman-que-el-acta-de-independencia-guarda-buen-estado.htm |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="actaespaña"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ficha Acta de Independencia del Imperio Mexicano, 1821. |url=http://www.agn.gob.mx/independencia/fichas/Acta%20de%20Independencia%20Imperio%20Mexicano.html |accessdate=March 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215043015/http://www.agn.gob.mx/independencia/fichas/Acta%20de%20Independencia%20Imperio%20Mexicano.html |archivedate=February 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later, the act appeared in Spain in the library of antiquarian Gabriel Sánchez. It is also unknown how he got it, but is a fact that the act has in the back the stamp of the Spanish antiquarian library. Sánchez sold the document to the Mexican historian [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]], who preserved it and passed it down to his son Luis García Pimentel.&lt;ref name="actaespaña" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acta de Independencia, manuscrito que da fe del nacimiento de México. |url=http://www.excentricaonline.com/libros/escritores_more.php?id=6968_0_8_0_M |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florencio Gavito Bustillo lived in France and there he was contacted by Luis García Pimentel, who offered to sell him the Declaration of Independence. After buying the act for 10 thousand [[Mexican peso|pesos]] he returned to Mexico with the intention of delivering the act to the Mexican government himself, but he died of [[leukemia]] in 1958. Gavito expressed in his will the wish that the act should be delivered to the [[President of Mexico|president]].

The Mexican government sent the document for opinions of authenticity. The opinions were ready on November 14, 1961.

The ceremony to deliver the act was held on November 21 of the same year. Florencio Gavito Jauregui, son of Gavito Bustillo gave the act to the president [[Adolfo López Mateos]]. In the ceremony were also [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]], [[Secretariat of the Interior (Mexico)|Secretary of the Interior]] and [[Jaime Torres Bodet]], [[Secretary of Education (Mexico)|Secretary of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Un acta de Independencia fugitiva. |url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/558409.un-acta-de-independencia-fugitiva.html |publisher=El siglo de Torreón |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Invaluable regalo a México. |url=http://www.yucatan.com.mx/20100920/nota-13/4717-invaluable-regalo-a-mexico.htm |publisher=Diario de Yucatán |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act was put on display for a while in [[Chapultepec Castle]] and then it was withdrawn and sent to the General Archive of the Nation.

In 2008, the restoration works on the act began and it was exhibited for a month at the [[Palace of Lecumberri]]. In 2010 it was put on display at the National Palace as part of the celebration of the [[Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010|bicentennial of the beginning of Mexico's independence]]. The [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]] was concerned about the exposure of the act and recommended not to expose it to more time because it does not have a special system for that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=México expone tesoros de 200 años de historia en Palacio Nacional. |url=http://mexico.cnn.com/bicentenario/2010/09/08/mexico-expone-tesoros-de-200-anos-de-historia-en-palacio-nacional |publisher=CNN |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=En riesgo Acta de Independencia: INAH |url=http://www.eluniversal.mx/notas/702670.html |publisher=El Universal |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] are working on a system of preservation and exhibition of historical documents in order to permanently exhibit the act in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acta de Independencia, en buen estado: INAH |url=http://www.eluniversal.mx/notas/704114.html |publisher=El Universal |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Diseñan en la UNAM exhibidores para resguardar el Acta de Independencia. |url=http://anuario.upn.mx/index.php/noticias-educativas/noticias-educativas-2010/52-diario-de-yucatan/9189-disenan-en-la-unam-exhibidores-para-resguardar-el-acta-de-independencia-.html |publisher=Universidad Pedagógica Nacional |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology TITLE.jpg|right|thumb]]
The '''''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology''''' (1849, originally published 1844 under a slightly different title) is an [[encyclopedia]]/[[biographical dictionary]]. Edited by [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], the dictionary spans three volumes and 3,700 pages. It is a classic work of 19th-century [[lexicography]]. The work is a companion to Smith's ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]'' and ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Smith, Sir William |volume=25 |page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authors and scope==
[[File:Philolaus-and-Philomelus-Pythagorean-Book.jpg|thumb|Excerpt from [[Philolaus]] Pythagoras book, (Charles Peter Mason, 1870)]]
The work lists thirty-five authors in addition to the editor, who is also an author for some definitions and articles. The authors were [[Classics|classical]] scholars, primarily from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[Rugby School]], and the [[University of Bonn]], but some were from other institutions. Many of the mythological entries were the work of the German expatriate [[Leonhard Schmitz]], who helped to popularise German classical scholarship in Britain.&lt;ref name=lowe&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]] |title=Killing the Graves myth |work=[[The Times|Times Online]] |location=London |date=20 December 2005 |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/others/article1888498.ece |accessdate=2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to biographies, Smith intended to be comprehensive. In the preface, he writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;The biographical articles in this work include the names of all persons of any importance which occur in the Greek and Roman writers, from the earliest times down to the extinction of the Western Empire in the year 476 of our era, and to the extinction of the Eastern Empire by the capture of Constantinople by the turks in the year 1453.&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Samuel Sharpe (scholar)|Samuel Sharpe]] thought [[Edward Bunbury]] had plagiarised his work, as he wrote of in his diary entry on 3 September 1850: &lt;blockquote&gt;I certainly felt mortified on reading the articles on the Ptolemies in Dr. Smith's "Dictionary of Classical Biography." They were all written by E. H. Bunbury with the help of my "History of Egypt," and with-out any acknowledgment, though he even borrowed the volume from my brother [[Daniel Sharpe|Dan]] for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayden|first1=PW|title=Samuel Sharpe|page=82|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924026852180/cu31924026852180_djvu.txt|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Many of the ''Dictionary''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s definitions and articles have been referred to in more recent works, and [[Robert Graves]] has been accused of "lifting his impressive-looking source references straight, and unchecked" from it when writing ''[[The Greek Myths]]''.&lt;ref name="lowe" /&gt;

==Use and availability today==
The work is now in the [[public domain]], and is available in several places on the Internet. While still largely accurate (only rarely have ancient texts been emended so severely as to warrant a biographical change), much is missing, especially more recent discoveries (such as [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'', or the decipherment of [[Linear B]]) and epigraphic material. Perhaps more seriously, the context in which ancient evidence is viewed has often changed in the intervening century and a half.

'''Don Camillo''' {{IPA-it|ˈdɔŋ kaˈmillo|}} is a character created by the Italian writer and journalist [[Giovannino Guareschi]], whose name, and some of his character, is based on an actual [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] priest, [[World War II]] partisan and detainee at the concentration camps of [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Mauthausen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], named Don Camillo Valota (1912&amp;ndash;1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.mkoe.at/ | title= Mauthausen Komitee Österreich |trans-title= Austrian Mauthausen Committee | language= de}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/novembre/05/Morto_Bormio_don_Camillo_suo_co_5_9811051913.shtml |title= Morto a Bormio don Camillo; Il suo nome ispiro' Guareschi | language= Italian |trans-title=Dead at Bormio don Camillo; his name inspired Guareschi |newspaper= [[Corriere della Sera]] |date= 5 November 1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Guareschi was also inspired by Don Alessandro Parenti, a priest of [[Trepalle]], near the Swiss border. The fictional Don Camillo is one of two main protagonists of Guareschi's short stories, the other being the communist mayor of the town, Peppone.  The stories are set in what Guareschi refers to as the "small world" of rural Italy after World War II.

Most of the Don Camillo stories came out in the weekly magazine ''Candido'', founded by Guareschi with Giovanni Mosca.  These "Little World" (Italian: ''Mondo piccolo'') stories amounted to 347 in total and were put together and published in eight books, only the first three of which were published when Guareschi was still alive.

==Characterisation==
[[File:Don camillo4.jpg|thumb|Don Camillo played by [[Fernandel]]]]
In the post-war years (after 1945), [[Don (honorific)|Don]] '''Camillo Tarocci''' (his full name, which he rarely uses) is the hotheaded priest of a small town in the [[Po valley]] in northern [[Italy]]. Don Camillo is a big man, tall and strong with hard fists. For the films, the town chosen to represent that of the books was [[Brescello]] (which currently has a museum dedicated to Don Camillo and Peppone) after the production of movies based on Guareschi's tales, but in the first story Don Camillo is introduced as the parish priest of Ponteratto.
[[File:Don camillo.jpg|thumb|Don Camillo talking with [[Jesus]]]]

Don Camillo is constantly at odds with the [[communist]] mayor, Giuseppe Bottazzi, better known as '''Peppone''' (meaning, roughly, ''Big Joe'') and is also on very close terms with the [[crucifix]] in his town church. Through the crucifix he hears the voice of Christ.&lt;ref name = lower-alpha&gt;As the author notes in the preface of the first book, not the Christ, but "his" Christ, the voice of his conscience.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christ in the crucifix often has far greater understanding than Don Camillo of the troubles of the people, and has to constantly but gently reprimand the priest for his impatience.

What Peppone and Camillo have in common is an interest in the well-being of the town. They also appear to have both been [[Italian Resistance Movement|partisan]] fighters during [[World War II]]; one episode mentions Camillo having braved German patrols in order to reach Peppone and his fellow Communists in the mountains and administer Mass to them under field conditions. While Peppone makes public speeches about how "the reactionaries" ought to be shot, and Don Camillo preaches [[fire and brimstone]] against "godless Communists", they actually grudgingly admire each other. Therefore, they sometimes end up working together in peculiar circumstances, though keeping up their squabbling. Thus, although he publicly opposes the Church as a Party duty, Peppone takes his gang to the church and baptises his children there, which makes him part of Don Camillo's flock; also, Peppone and other Communists are seen as sharing in veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]] and local Saints. Don Camillo also never condemns Peppone himself, but the ideology of communism which is in direct opposition to the church.

As depicted in the stories, the Communists are the only political party with a mass grassroots organization in the town. The [[Italian Christian Democratic Party]], the main force in Italian politics at the time, does not have a local political organization (at least, none is ever mentioned); rather, it is the Catholic Church which unofficially but very obviously plays that role. Don Camillo thus plays an explicitly political as well as religious role. For example, when the Communists organize a local campaign to sign the [[Stockholm Peace Appeal]], it is Don Camillo who organizes a counter-campaign, and townspeople take for granted that such a political campaign is part of his work as priest.

Many stories are satirical and take on the real world political divide between the Italian [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Italian Communist Party]], not to mention other worldly politics. Others are tragedies about schism, politically motivated murder, and personal [[Feud|vendetta]]s in a small town where everyone knows everyone else, but not everyone necessarily likes everyone else very much.

Political forces other than the Communists and the Catholics have only a marginal presence. In one episode the local Communists are incensed at the announcement that the small [[Italian Liberal Party]] has scheduled an elections rally in their town, and mobilize in force to break it up — only to discover virtually no local Liberals have turned up; the Liberal speaker, a middle-aged professor, speaks to a predominantly Communist audience and wins its grudging respect by his courage and determination.

In one story, Don Camillo visits the [[Soviet Union]], pretending to be a [[comrade]]. In another, the arrival of pop culture and motorcycles propels Don Camillo into fighting "decadence", a struggle in which he finds he has his hands full, especially when the Christ mainly smiles benevolently on the young rascals. In this later collection, Peppone is the proprietor of several profitable dealerships, riding the "Boom" years of the 1960s in Italy. He is no longer quite the committed Communist he once was, but he still does not get on with Don Camillo — at least not in public. Don Camillo has his own problems — the [[Second Vatican Council]] has brought changes in the Church, and a new assistant priest, who comes to be called Don Chichì, has been foisted upon him to see that Don Camillo moves with the times. Don Camillo, of course, has other ideas.

Despite their bickering, the goodness and generosity of each character can be seen during hard times. They always understand and respect each other when one is in danger, when a flood devastates the town, when death takes a loved one, and in many other situations in which the two "political enemies" show their mutual respect for one another and fight side by side for the same ideals (even if they are each conditioned by their individual public roles in society).

Guareschi created a second series of novels about a similar character, Don Candido, Archbishop of Trebilie (or Trebiglie, literally "three marble balls" or "three billiard balls"). The name of this fictional town is a play on words of [[Trepalle]] (literally "three balls"), a real town (near [[Livigno]]) whose priest was an acquaintance of Guareschi's.

==Adaptations==

===Films===
A series of black-and-white films were made between 1952 and 1965. These were French-Italian coproductions and were simultaneously released in both languages. Don Camillo was played by French actor [[Fernandel]], Peppone by the Italian actor [[Gino Cervi]], quite a Guareschi-lookalike, both tall and bulky with big mustaches. The author of the original stories was involved in the scripts and helped select the main actors. To this day, the films are screened in Europe. The titles were:

*''[[Le Petit Monde de Don Camillo|The Little World of Don Camillo]]'' (Italian: ''Don Camillo''; French: ''Le Petit Monde de don Camillo'')&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0043918|Don Camillo (1952)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Return of Don Camillo]]'' (Italian:'' Il ritorno di don Camillo ''; French: ''Le Retour de don Camillo'')&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0045081|Le retour de Don Camillo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Don Camillo's Last Round]]'' (Italian: ''Don Camillo e l'onorevole Peppone''; French: ''La Grande Bagarre'')&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0048002|Don Camillo e l'on. Peppone}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Don Camillo: Monsignor]]'' (Italian: ''Don Camillo monsignore ma non troppo''; French:'' Don Camillo Monseigneur'')&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0054814|Don Camillo monsignore ma non troppo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Don Camillo in Moscow]]'' (Italian: ''Il compagno don Camillo''; French:'' Don Camillo en Russie'')&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0059049|Il compagno Don Camillo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mario Camerini began filming the French-Italian film ''Don Camillo e i giovani d'oggi''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0068495|Don Camillo e i giovani d'oggi}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had to stop filming due to Fernandel's falling ill, which resulted in his untimely death.  The film was then completed in 1972 with [[Gastone Moschin]] playing the role of Don Camillo and [[Lionel Stander]] as Peppone. A Don Camillo (''[[The World of Don Camillo]]''; Italian: ''Don Camillo'') film was remade in 1983, an Italian production with [[Terence Hill]] directing and also starring as Don Camillo. [[Colin Blakely]] performed Peppone in one of his last film roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0085454|Don Camillo (1984)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
A [[BBC Radio]] English-language radio dramatization of ''The Little World of Don Camillo'' was broadcast in 2001 starring [[Alun Armstrong (actor)|Alun Armstrong]] as Don Camillo, [[John Moffatt (actor)|John Moffatt]] as the Bishop, [[Shaun Prendergast]] as Peppone and [[Joss Ackland]] as God, and rebroadcast in July 2010 on [[BBC Radio 7]].

Four further [[BBC Radio]] series of ''The Little World of Don Camillo'' were made, with the final series broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in December 2006.&lt;ref name =BBC&gt;{{Citation

[[BBC Radio 7]] broadcast the second and third series throughout August and September 2010 with the fourth series beginning on 6 October.&lt;ref name =BBC2&gt;{{Citation

===Television===
In 1980, the [[BBC]] produced the television series ''The Little World of Don Camillo'', based on the stories, starring Italian-German actor [[Mario Adorf]] as Don Camillo and Englishman [[Brian Blessed]] as Peppone. The narrator and Voice of the Christ was [[Cyril Cusack]].

In Colombia the stories were adapted into a TV comedy called ''Don Camilo''. The Italian Communist era was changed to a Colombian period called "La Violencia" when the Liberal and Conservative parties were fighting to maintain power in Colombia. The comedy was produced from 1987 to 1988 by the now defunct Coestrellas company and produced and directed by Daniel Samper Pizano and Bernando Romero Pereiro. The series starred [[Carlos Benjumea]] as Don Camillo (Don Camilo in Colombian Spanish), [[Hector Rivas]] as Peppone (Pepón in Colombian Spanish), Luis Fernando Múnera as The Christ Voice, and the actors Diego León Hoyos and Manuel Pachón as Peppone flunkies. The series was broadcast on Mondays at 10:00 pm by [[Canal A|Cadena 2]] ([[Señal Institucional]] now) and rebroadcast by [[Señal Colombia]] in 2011 and [[Canal Uno]] in 2014.

===Thai Novel===
''The Little World of Don Camillo'' was adapted by the [[Thai people|Thai]] writer and politician [[Kukrit Pramoj]] into his own 1954 novel, ''Phai Daeng'' (Red Bamboo).

The '''''Eric Chronicle''''' (Swedish: ''Erikskrönikan'') is the oldest surviving Swedish [[chronicle]]. It was written by an unknown author (or, less probably, several authors) between about 1320 and 1335.

It is the oldest in a group of medieval rhymed chronicles recounting political events in Sweden. It is one of Sweden's earliest and most important narrative sources. Its authorship and precise political significance and biases are debated, but it is clear that the chronicle's protagonist and hero is [[Eric, Duke of Södermanland]], brother of King [[Birger, King of Sweden|Birger of Sweden]].

The chronicle is written in ''[[knittelvers]]'', a form of [[doggerel]], and in its oldest version is 4543 lines long. It begins in 1229, with the reign of [[Eric XI of Sweden]] (d. 1250) but focuses on the period 1250-1319, ending in the year when the three-year-old [[Magnus IV of Sweden]] came to the throne. It survives in six manuscripts from the fifteenth century and a further fourteen from the sixteenth and seventeenth.

== Context ==
{{main article|Ross expedition|Flora Antarctica}}

The British government fitted out [[Ross expedition|an expedition]] led by [[James Clark Ross]] to investigate magnetism and marine geography in high southern latitudes, which sailed with two ships, [[HMS Terror (1813)|HMS ''Terror'']] and [[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS ''Erebus'']] on 29 September 1839 from Chatham.

The ships arrived, after several stops, at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 4 April 1840. On 21 April the giant kelp ''[[Macrocystis pyrifera]]'' was found off [[Prince Edward Islands|Marion Island]], but no landfall could be made there or on the [[Crozet Islands]] due to the harsh winds. On 12 May the ships anchored at Christmas Harbour for two and a half months, during which all the plant species previously encountered by [[James Cook]] on the [[Kerguelen Islands]] were collected. On 16 August they reached the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]], remaining in Tasmania until 12 November. A week later the flotilla stopped at [[Auckland Islands|Lord Auckland's Islands]] and [[Campbell Island group|Campbell's Island]] for the spring months.

Large floating forests of ''Macrocystis'' and ''[[Durvillaea]]'' were found until the ships ran into icebergs at latitude 61° S. [[Drift ice|Pack-ice]] was met at 68° S and longitude 175°. During this part of the voyage [[Victoria Land]], [[Mount Erebus]] and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] were discovered. After returning to Tasmania for three months, the flotilla went via Sydney to the [[Bay of Islands]], and stayed for three months in New Zealand to collect plants there. After visiting other islands, the ships returned to the Cape of Good Hope on 4 April 1843. At the end of the journey specimens of some fifteen hundred plant species had been collected and preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J.D.

[[File:Retable St.Marys Thornham Parva - geograph.org.uk - 542418.jpg|thumb|The [[Thornham Parva]] Retable]]
The '''Hamilton Kerr Institute''' is a branch of the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], [[England]], dedicated to the study and conservation of easel paintings. It is also part of the [[University of Cambridge]].

== Facilities and logistics ==
The institute was founded in 1976 through grants from the [[Baring Foundation]], the [[Esmée Fairbairn Trust]], the [[Gulbenkian Foundation]], the [[Isaac Wolfson Foundation]], the [[Monument Trust]], and the [[Pilgrim Trust]], and continues to finance itself through income from its work and its endowment fund. It is housed in a riverside property, donated by [[Hamilton Kerr]], seven miles south of [[Cambridge]] in the village of [[Whittlesford]]. The premises consist of a mid-eighteenth century house and converted mill buildings, containing offices and a scientific laboratory, restoration studios, studios for panel treatment and the relining of canvases, and studios for photography. In 1980, the institute opened a studio in [[London]].&lt;ref name="fitz"&gt;[http://www-hki.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/history/ Hamilton Kerr Institute History Page]. Retrieved 24 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable restoration accomplishments ==
*The [[Westminster Retable]]: 1998–2004. The Westminster Retable of ca. 1270 was the main altarpiece for [[Westminster Abbey]] during pre-Reformation [[England]]. When it was rediscovered in the 18th century, several poorly executed restoration attempts damaged the retable. In 1998, the institute acquired this work, and began work on repairing and restoring it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electric-review.com/archives/000260.html |title=The Westminster Retable at the National Gallery |author=Bunny Smedley |date=27 May 2005 |accessdate=24 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120070940/http://www.electric-review.com/archives/000260.html |archivedate=20 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Thornham Parva Retable]]. This 15-ft long medieval altarpiece was restored after an eight-year plan. Estimated to be worth millions, the altarpiece is thought to have been created in the 1330s for a Dominican Priory in [[Norfolk]]. It now stands in a protective glass case in [[St Mary's Church, Thornham Parva|St Mary's Church]], [[Thornham Parva]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4706/is_/ai_n17277874 The Hamilton Kerr Institute in Cambridge has restored a 15-ft long medieval altarpiece], ''[[History Today]]'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hatheway House''', also known as the '''Phelps-Hatheway House &amp; Garden''' is a [[historic house museum]] at 55 South Main Street in [[Suffield, Connecticut]].  The sprawling house has sections built as early as 1732, with significant alterations made in 1795 to a design by [[Asher Benjamin]] for [[Oliver Phelps]], a major land speculator.  The house provides a window into a wide variety of 18th-century home construction methods.  It is now maintained by [[Connecticut Landmarks]], and is open seasonally between May and October.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==Description and history==
The Hatheway House is located in the village center of Suffield, on the west side of South Main Street, south of its junction with Bridge Street.  It is a sprawling multi-section wood frame structure, with a 2-1/2 story five-bay central block flanked on the north by a 2-1/2 story three-bay section and on the left by a 1-1/2 story ell.  Each section is covered by gambrel roof and is sheated in wooden clapboards.  The center block, built in 1762, has a large central chimney, and its interior is finished with high-quality Georgian woodwork.  The southern ell is an older structure with simple finishes, and may date as far back as 1732.  The northern addition was added in 1795.  The main entrance is at the center of the main block, sheltered by a Doric portico designed by Asher Benjamin and added in 1795.  Outbuildings on the property include a carriage house and barn, both 19th-century structures.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|75001934}}|title=NRHP nomination for Hatheway House|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main block of the house was built about 1762, probably by Abraham Burbank, and was originally more plainly decorated with a gable roof.  Burbank's son Shem sold the house to Oliver Phelps in 1788.  Phelps, then already a man of some wealth and sophistication, transformed the house into the mansion it is now.  Phelps was a principal in the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]] of six million acres of land in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]], making him one of the nation's largest landowners.  Phelps lived here until 1802, when he moved to [[Canandaigua, New York]], to more closely oversee the development and sale of his holdings.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

==Description==
This document is both dedicated to Hrvoje Vukčić, and is of great significance to Croatian and Bosnian history.&lt;ref name="Ethnicity-Did-Not-Matter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tradition-Betrayed"/&gt; Hrvoje's Missal is kept at the [[Topkapı Palace|Topkapı Palace Museum Manuscript Library]] in [[Istanbul]]). Once bound in precious covers, from 19th century Hrvoje's Missal is in [[leather]] binding. Hrvoje's Missal is considered as one of the most beautiful Croatian Glagolitic books. It contains 247 folios, which includes 96 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and 380 [[initial]]s and many more small initials. Some details are made of golden leaves. It is written in two columns on 488 pp (22.5x31 cm), and contains also some [[music notation]]. Some [[initials]] contain architectural elements of the [[Dalmatia]]n city of Split. The particular value of the Hrvoje's Missal lies in its combination of eastern and [[Western world|western]] principles in terms of composition and contents, thus making it a truly deluxe work and securing it a place in the regional and transregional history of art.

'''ITU-R 468''' (originally defined in [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] recommendation 468-4; sometimes referred to as '''CCIR-1k''') is a standard relating to [[noise measurement]], widely used when measuring noise in audio systems.  The standard,&lt;ref name="itu"&gt;{{cite web|title=RECOMMENDATION ITU-R BS.468-4 - Measurement of audio-frequency noise voltage|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.468-4-198607-I!!PDF-E.pdf|website=www.itu.int|publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]]|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; now referred to as ITU-R BS.468-4, defines a [[weighting filter]] curve, together with a [[quasi-peak]] [[rectifier]] having special characteristics as defined by specified [[tone-burst]] tests.  It is currently maintained by the [[International Telecommunications Union]] who took it over from the CCIR.

It is used especially in the UK, Europe, and former countries of the [[British Empire]] such as Australia and South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It is less well known in the USA where [[A-weighting]] has always been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.95|title=1910.95 - Occupational noise exposure. {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''M-weighting''' is a closely related filter, an offset version of the same curve, without the quasi-peak detector.  See [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting#Present usage of 468-weighting|Present usage of 468-weighting]].

== Explanation ==
While most audio engineers are familiar with the [[A-weighting]] curve, which was based on the 40 phon [[equal-loudness contour]] derived initially by [[Fletcher-Munson curves|Fletcher and Munson]] (1933) the later CCIR-468 weighting curve, now supported as an [[ITU]] standard is less well known outside of the UK and Europe. Originally incorporated into an ANSI standard for [[sound level meters]], A-weighting was intended for measurement of the audibility of sounds by themselves. It was never specifically intended for the measurement of the more random (near-[[White noise|white]] or [[Pink noise|pink]]) noise in electronic equipment, though has been used for this purpose by most microphone manufacturers since the 1970s. The human ear responds quite differently to clicks and bursts of random noise, and it is this difference that gave rise to the 468-weighting, which together with quasi-peak measurement (rather than the rms measurement used with A-weighting) became widely used by broadcasters throughout Britain, Europe, and former [[British Commonwealth]] countries, where engineers were heavily influenced by [[BBC]] test methods. Telephone companies worldwide have also used methods similar to 468 weighting with quasi-peak measurement to describe objectionable interference induced in one telephone circuit by switching transients in another.

== History ==
=== Original research ===
Developments in the 1960s, in particular the spread of [[FM broadcasting|FM]] broadcasting and the development of the [[Compact Cassette|compact audio cassette]] with [[Dolby-B Noise Reduction]], alerted engineers to the need for a weighting curve that gave subjectively meaningful results on the typical random noise that limited the performance of broadcast circuits, equipment and radio circuits. A-weighting was not giving consistent results, especially on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio transmissions and Compact Cassette recording where [[preemphasis]] of high frequencies was resulting in increased noise readings that did not correlate with subjective effect. Early efforts to produce a better weighting curve led to a DIN standard that was adopted for European Hi-Fi equipment measurement for a while.

Experiments in the [[BBC]] led to [[BBC Research Department]] Report EL-17, ''The Assessment of Noise in Audio Frequency Circuits'',&lt;ref&gt;BBC Research Department Report - The assessment of noise in audio-frequency circuits. http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/reports/1968-08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in which experiments on numerous test subjects were reported, using a variety of noises ranging from clicks to tone-bursts to [[pink noise]]. Subjects were asked to compare these with a 1&amp;nbsp;kHz tone, and final scores were then compared with measured noise levels using various combinations of weighting filter and quasi-peak detector then in existence (such as those defined in a now discontinued German [[DIN]] standard). This led to the CCIR-468 standard which defined a new weighting curve and quasi-peak rectifier.

The origin of the current ITU-R 468 weighting curve can be traced to 1956.  The 1968 BBC EL-17 report discusses several weighting curves, including one identified as ''D.P.B.'' which was chosen as superior to the alternatives: A.S.A, C.C.I.F and O.I.R.T.  The report's graph of the DPB curve is identical to that of the ITU-R 486 curve, except that the latter extends to slightly lower and higher frequencies.  The BBC report states that this curve was given in a "contribution by the D.B.P. (The Telephone Administration of the Federal German Republic) in the Red Book Vol. 1 1957 covering the first plenary assembly of the CCITT (Geneva 1956)". D.B.P. is [[Deutsche Bundespost]], the German post office which provides telephone service in Germany as the GPO does in the UK.  The BBC report states "this characteristic is based on subjective tests described by Belger." and cites a 1953 paper by E. Belger.    

Dolby Laboratories took up the new CCIR-468 weighting for use in measuring noise on their noise reduction systems, both in cinema (Dolby A) and on cassette decks (Dolby B), where other methods of measurement were failing to show up the advantage of such noise reduction. Some Hi-Fi column writers took up 468 weighting enthusiastically, observing that it reflected the roughly 10dB improvement in noise observed subjectively on cassette recordings when using Dolby B while other methods could indicate an actual worsening in some circumstances, because they did not sufficiently attenuate noise above 10&amp;nbsp;kHz.

=== Standards ===
[[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] Recommendation 468-1 was published soon after this report, and appears to have been based on the BBC work. Later versions up to CCIR468-4 differed only in minor changes to permitted tolerances. This standard was then incorporated into many other national and international standards (IEC, BSI, JIS, ITU) and adopted widely as the standard method for measuring noise, in broadcasting, professional audio, and '[[Hi-Fi]]' specifications throughout the 1970s. When the CCIR ceased to exist, the standard was officially taken over by the [[ITU-R]] ([[International Telecommunication Union]]). Current work on this standard occurs primarily in the maintenance of IEC 60268, the international standard for sound systems.

The CCIR curve differs greatly from A-weighting in the 5 to 8&amp;nbsp;kHz region where it peaks to +12.2 dB at 6.3&amp;nbsp;kHz, the region in which we appear to be extremely sensitive to noise. While it has been said (incorrectly) that the difference is due to a requirement for assessing noise intrusiveness in the presence of programme material, rather than just loudness, the BBC report makes clear the fact that this was not the basis of the experiments. The real reason for the difference probably relates to the way in which our ears analyse sounds in terms of spectral content along the [[cochlea]]. This behaves like a [[filter bank|set of closely spaced filters]] with a roughly constant [[Q factor]], that is, bandwidths proportional to their centre frequencies. High frequency [[hair cell]]s would therefore be sensitive to a greater proportion of the total energy in noise than low frequency hair cells. Though hair-cell responses are not exactly constant Q, and matters are further complicated by the way in which the brain integrates adjacent hair-cell outputs, the resultant effect appears roughly as a tilt centred on 1&amp;nbsp;kHz imposed on the A-weighting.

Dependent on spectral content, 468-weighted measurements of noise are generally about 11 dB higher than A-weighted, and this is probably a factor in the recent trend away from 468-weighting in equipment specifications as cassette tape use declines. 

It is important to realise that the 468 specification covers both weighted and 'unweighted' (using a 22&amp;nbsp;Hz to 22&amp;nbsp;kHz 18 dB/octave bandpass filter) measurement and that both use a very special quasi-peak rectifier with carefully devised dynamics (A-weighting uses [[root mean square|RMS]] detection for no particular reason{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}). Rather than having a simple 'integration time' this detector requires implementation with two cascaded 'peak followers' each with different attack time-constants carefully chosen to control the response to both single and repeating tone-bursts of various durations. This ensures that measurements on [[impulse noise (audio)|impulsive noise]] take proper account of our reduced hearing sensitivity to short bursts. This [[quasi-peak]] measurement is also called [[psophometric weighting]].

This was once more important because outside broadcasts were carried over 'music circuits' that used telephone lines, with clicks from [[Strowger switch|Strowger]] and other electromechanical telephone exchanges. It now finds fresh relevance in the measurement of noise on computer 'Audio Cards' which commonly suffer clicks as drives start and stop.

== Present usage of 468-weighting ==
468-weighting is also used in weighted distortion measurement at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. Weighting the distortion residue after removal of the fundamental emphasises high-order harmonics, but only up to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz or so where the ears response falls off. This results in a single measurement (sometimes called [[distortion residue]] measurement) which has been claimed to correspond well with subjective effect even for power amplifiers where [[crossover distortion]] is known to be far more audible than normal THD ([[Total harmonic distortion]]) measurements would suggest.

468-weighting is still demanded by the BBC and many other broadcasters,&lt;ref name="Lindos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lindos.co.uk/cgi-bin/FlexiData.cgi?SOURCE=Articles&amp;VIEW=full&amp;id=10 |title=468 - Weighting in Detail |publisher=Lindos |accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; with increasing awareness of its existence and the fact that it is more valid on random noise where pure tones do not exist.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Often both A-weighted and 468-weighted figures are quoted for noise, especially in microphone specifications.

While not intended for this application, the 468 curve has also been used (offset to place the 0 dB point at 2 kHz rather than 1 kHz) as "M weighting" in standards such as ISO 21727&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:21727:ed-2:v1:en|title=ISO 21727:2016(en) Cinematography — Method of measurement of perceived loudness of short duration motion-picture audio material|last=|first=|date=2016|website=ISO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to gauge loudness or annoyance of cinema soundtracks. This application of the weighting curve does not include the quasi-peak detector specified in the ITU standard.

==Summary of specification ==
Note: this is not the full definitive standard.
===Weighting curve specification ( Weighted measurement)===
The weighting curve is specified by both a circuit diagram of a weighting network and a table of amplitude responses.

[[File:Itu-r 468-circuit.png]]

Above is the ITU-R 468 Weighting Filter Circuit Diagram.  The source and sink impedances are both 600 ohms (resistive), as shown in the diagram.  The values are taken directly from the ITU-R 468 specification.  Note that since this circuit is purely passive, it cannot create the additional 12dB gain required; any results must be corrected by a factor of 8.1333, or +18.2dB.

The values of the amplitude response table slightly differ from those resulting from the circuit diagram, e.g. because of the finite resolution of the numerical values. In the standard it is said that the 33.06&amp;nbsp;nF capacitor may be adjusted or an active filter may be used.

Modeling at hand the circuit above and some calculus give this formula to get the amplitude response in dB for any given frequency value :


:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{ITU}(f) = \frac{1.246332637532143\cdot10^{-4} \, f}{\sqrt{(h_1(f))^2 + (h_2(f))^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ITU}(f) = 18.2+20\log_{10}\left(R_\mathrm{ITU}(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;h_1(f)=-4.737338981378384\cdot10^{-24} \, f^6 + 2.043828333606125\cdot10^{-15} \, f^4 - 1.363894795463638\cdot10^{-7} \, f^2 + 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h_2(f)=1.306612257412824\cdot10^{-19} \, f^5  - 2.118150887518656\cdot10^{-11} \, f^3 + 5.559488023498642\cdot10^{-4} \, f&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">'''Index Copernicus''' (IC) is an online [[database]] of user-contributed information, including scientist [[User profile|profiles]], as well as of scientific [[institution]]s, [[publication]]s and [[project]]s established in 1999 in Poland, and operated by Index Copernicus International.  The database, named after [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (who triggered the [[Copernican Revolution]]), has several assessment tools to track the impact of scientific works and publications, individual scientists, or research institutions. In addition to the productivity aspects, IC also offers the traditional [[Abstract (summary)|abstracting]] and [[Bibliographic index|indexing]] of scientific publications. 

== Origins ==
The Index Copernicus aimed to offer an alternative to the English language dominance of publication indexing systems. The enterprise was co-financed by the [[European Regional Development Fund]] under the name: "Electronic Publishing House of Scientific Journals system of Index Copernicus Ltd."{{cn|date=July 2015}}

== Controversy ==
IC's journal ranking system was criticized in 2013 by [[Jeffrey Beall]] because of the high proportion of [[Predatory open access publishing|predatory journals]] included in it and its suspect evaluation methodology; he characterized the resulting "IC Value" as "a pretty worthless measure".&lt;ref name=Beall&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2013/11/21/index-copernicus-has-no-value/ |title=Index Copernicus Has No Value |work=Scholarly Open Access |author=[[Jeffrey Beall]] |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2014-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403010813/http://scholarlyoa.com/2013/11/21/index-copernicus-has-no-value/ |archivedate=2014-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of [[J. J. Benítez]] encompass literature and journalism, as well as UFO investigations.&lt;ref name=laverdad/&gt; Primarily renowned as an investigator of the paranormal,&lt;ref name=casadellibro/&gt; Benítez garnered attention and criticism when he released ''Jerusalén'', the first volume of a series named ''[[Caballo de Troya]]'', related to the life and death of [[Jesus Christ]]. He began his journalist career in January 1966  in the newspaper ''La Verdad'', after receiving a journalism degree from the [[University of Navarra]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=laverdad/&gt; He published his first books in 1975, ''Ovni: S.O.S a la Humanidad'' and ''Existió Otra Humanidad''.

During his three decades as an author, he has published more than 50 books, including [[Reports|investigative reports]], [[essays]], [[novels]] and [[poetry]], and sold more than nine million copies worldwide. As of May 2007, 7 million copies has been sold from the first 8 books of the ''Caballo de Troya'' series.&lt;ref name="Ummitas50"/&gt; He has also directed a [[TV documentary]] series called ''Planeta Encantado'', in which he travels to 17 different countries in order to render his interpretation of some of the great unsolved mysteries of past history.&lt;ref name=IMDB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18195">A '''Lobby Registry''', also named '''Lobbyist Registry''', '''Register for Lobby Transparency''' or '''Registry of Lobbyists''' is a public database, in which information about [[lobbying]] actors and key data about their actions can be accessed.

Its aim is to gain [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] about possible influences of [[interest group]]s on [[Member of Parliament|Parliamentarians]] and their staff. Several studies indicate that lobby transparency leads to a decrease of [[corruption]].&lt;ref name="CompAnalysisHolmana" /&gt;
Registers exist for political committees of several countries. Their effectiveness is rated differently, strongly depending on their exact regulations. Many non-mandatory registers do not include powerful lobbyists.&lt;ref Name="CompAnalysisHolmana" /&gt;&lt;ref Name="ComparativeAnalysis" /&gt;&lt;ref Name="RescueEURegister" /&gt;

== Positions and considerations ==
Register opponents mainly argued in a survey that there would be no need for regulations, since it would be self-regulating and that they would fear a barrier of free exchange of views.&lt;ref name="OpinionsOfActors" /&gt;
Different from the US, West European countries had only weak lobby regulations for a long time.
Authors of a study interpreted that the early West-European politic was not focusing the concept of lobby transparency to gain public confidence into political processes, but rather on promoting economic development by enabling undisturbed communication between politics and economy. This setting of priorities is currently changing due to scandals and public pressure.&lt;ref Name="CompAnalysisHolmana" /&gt;

== Regulation details ==
Many [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations (NGOs)]] see means of controlling and sanction to handle missing or wrong entries as a central prerequisite for a working register.&lt;ref name="RescueEURegister" /&gt;&lt;ref Name="OECDlobbying" /&gt; In many cases there are complains that this has not been put into practice.

Making an entry only mandatory if a certain threshold of money or time is spent on lobbying should prevent an inappropriately high bureaucratic burden for small actors (for example) in the US. Similar mechanisms are popular among supporters of a register.&lt;ref name="RescueEURegister" /&gt;

Implementation as a database is favored over a list format since it allows not only searches but also enables data analysis and graphical representations.&lt;ref Name="opensecrets"&gt;[http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/index.php lobby data analyzed by the NGO ”The Center for Responsive Politics”] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/60IJs5vay?url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/index.php |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contained data ===
Most registers contain at least the following data:
*Identity of the lobbyist
*contracting entity
*motivations/goals
*financial means
A survey among lobbyists conducted by the [[OECD|Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] revealed, that a majority of them would support a mandatory register and publication of the data above (excluding financial information).&lt;ref Name="OECDlobbying" /&gt;
Some registers, for example the Canadian, require much more data.

== Lobby registers in different countries ==

=== USA ===
A mandatory, publicly accessible and processable&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/index.php analyzed and graphically processed data about lobbyism is provided by the NGO “The Center for Responsive Politics”] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/60IJs5vay?url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/index.php |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; lobby register with enforced financial disclosure and theoretical high punishments exists on federal level,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/ Official Register US - Lobbying disclosure House of Representatives]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in every state besides Pennsylvania.&lt;ref Name="OpinionsOfActors" /&gt;
A register was introduced in the US in 1946 with the ''Lobbying Act''. Loopholes in the regulation lead to the fact that only 4&amp;nbsp;000 of 13&amp;nbsp;000 lobbyists were registered, before the rules of disclosure were substituted by the stricter [[Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995]]. In 2007 this was extended by the [[Honest Leadership and Open Government Act]] with more precise definitions and more powerful means of sanction.&lt;ref Name="ComparativeAnalysis" /&gt; The data published by this register is relatively informative. But it has been criticized that complaints lead to no action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33065.pdf Report for Congress - Lobbying Reform: Background and Legislative Proposals; RE Petersen; Congressional Research Service (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Canada was putting a ''Lobbyist Registration Act'' into operation in 1989. This was extended regularly to comply with higher demands about data given, to extend the applying field of scope and to enable more powerful means of sanction. Maximum punishments are two years in prison and 200,000 Canadian $ &lt;sup&gt;(ca. 190,000 US $ or 140,000 EUR)&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocl-cal.gc.ca/eic/site/012.nsf/eng/h_00008.html The Lobbying Act; The Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying, independent Agent of Parliament Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;
The strong regulations about lobby transparency demand lobbyists to report about their activity on a monthly basis. This includes the information, with which members of parliament or their staff they interacted and about which topics they spoke. The conduct has a law status, is equipped with sanctional power and is controlled by an independent office.

Complaints are pursued publicly, violations have been prosecuted legally in practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwatch.ca/camp/Ethics_Court_Cases.html Court Cases and Complaints About the Canadian Federal Government Ethics Rules and Enforcement System; Democracy Watch NGO]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario similar regulations were introduced.&lt;ref Name=ComparativeAnalysis /&gt;

=== European Union ===
The '''Transparency Register''' is a voluntary lobbyist register operated jointly by the European Parliament and the EU Commission since June 2011.&lt;ref name=EC2011PR/&gt; Its coverage extends beyond lobbyists to law firms, NGOs, and think tanks, and it includes information on staff numbers, the legislative proposals they have attempted to influence, and the amount of EU funding they have received.&lt;ref name=EC2011PR&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission and European Parliament launch Joint Transparency Register to shed light on all those seeking to influence European policy|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-11-773_en.htm?locale=en|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=14 March 2015|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be appealing that only registered lobbyists are granted passes that ease access to the parliament. As maximum means of sanction a commented deletion of the entry out of the registry and a withdrawal of the access pass is possible.
The transparency gained by this register is seen as minor, since entries are voluntary, were drawn back arbitrarily by lobbyist in the past and incorrect information (which the co-signed code of conduct&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/info/about-register/codeOfConduct.do?locale=en Codex of the EU transparency register]&lt;/ref&gt;  does not officially allow) is not sanctioned in practice. The register is however in an evaluation phase and there is the prospect of further improvement.&lt;ref Name="RescueEURegister" /&gt;
The [[European Parliament]] is still working to transform it into a mandatory register,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2011-0222+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN resolution of the EU Parliament; 11. May 2011; Point 5]&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[EU Commission]] is reluctant. First the reason given for this was that there would be no juristic basis. After a legal study disproved this,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alter-eu.org/documents/2013/06/legal-study legal study: a mandatory EU Lobby register is possible; Prof. Dr. Markus Krajewski, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; the EU Commission agreed that it was juristically possible, but stated that the current voluntary approach was sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foeeurope.org/legal_framework_mandatory_lobby_register180613 ALTER-EU: Legal framework for a mandatory EU lobby register; Friends Of The Earth Europe NGO; 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The need for a mandatory EU transparency register has also been highlighted by the anti-corruption organisation, [[Transparency International]] &lt;ref&gt;Transparency International's assessment of the proposal for a mandatory EU Transparency Register. At http://transparency.eu/resource/transparency-internationals-assessment-of-the-proposal-for-a-mandatory-eu-transparency-register/.&lt;/ref&gt; which has argued for the need to create a robust and credible mandatory register which would serve to increase the public trust in the EU institutions.

==== Legislative footprint ====
It has been planned by the EU Parliament in 2011 to publish a '''legislative footprint''' in the appendices of legislative reports. This should list all lobbyists that were in contact with the members of parliament or influenced them during the creation of the law text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdfs/news/expert/infopress/20110510IPR19128/20110510IPR19128_en.pdf press release ; European parliament; Reference No.: 20110510IPR19128]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
There is a voluntary register in the United Kingdom since 2011, but some NGOs criticize it as ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spinwatch.org/index.php/issues/lobbying/item/5517-spinwatch-statement-on-lobbying-register |title=Statement on the Register of Lobbyists Bill; 2013 |date=17 July 2013 |author=Spinwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{See also|Lobbying in the United Kingdom#Proposed regulation of lobbying}}

=== Germany ===
There is no mandatory lobby register in Germany.

Since 1972 associations can voluntarily be included in a list reciting their contact data, head and representatives, general interests of the association and the number of their members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/lobbyliste/index.html public list of registered trade associations, German Bundestag]&lt;/ref&gt;
The list is limited to associations and there is no data about self-employed lobbyists, lawyers, [[think tanks]] and NGOs. There is no financial information and the registration is voluntary. A regulation making a registry in the list mandatory for [[trade association]]s to be heard in the Parliament was put out of force later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lobbypedia.de/index.php/Verbändeliste association list - ''Verbändeliste'' - LobbyPedia article]&lt;/ref&gt; Many NGOs do not see this list as a means to further promote lobby transparency in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.de/fileadmin/pdfs/Wissen/NIS-report_Germany_short-version.PDF national integrity system report Germany (short version); 2012; Point 10; Transparency International - Germany NGO]&lt;/ref&gt;
Several initiatives of members of parliament in the opposition (social, left wing and green party) were denied by government (consisting of the conservatives and liberals 2009-2013).&lt;ref Name="BundestagStreit"&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2011/34043817_kw14_de_lobbyregister/ Discussion about the introduction of a new lobby register; German parliament; (available only in German)2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 the proposal of the opposition was turned down in the Bundestag. In the debate preceding the voting [[Hans-Peter Uhl]], CSU, judiciary of the conservative coalition, warned about the "discrimination and stigmatization" of interest groups. Presenting and discussing individual interests should not be criminalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nach Bundestagsentscheidung&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;"Einfluss von Lobbyisten ist nach wie vor sehr groß"|trans-title=|periodical=Deutschlandfunk|publisher=|url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/nach-bundestagsentscheidung-einfluss-von-lobbyisten-ist.694.de.html?dram:article_id=356876|format=|accessdate=2016-06-14|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=de-DE|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German states Brandenburg and Rhineland-Palatinate have de facto voluntary lists for associations that are comparable to the list on federal level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnn.de/brandenburg-berlin/748329/ The new lobby register of Brandenburg; 2013; Newspaper ''Potsdamer Neueste Nachrichten'' (available in German only)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austria ===
In Austria a mandatory lobby register&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lobbyreg.justiz.gv.at/ Lobbyingregister; Federal Ministry of Justice Austria; (available in German only)]&lt;/ref&gt; with duty of disclosure including financial information and means of sanction was put into force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viennareview.net/news/austria/lobbying-an-austrian-solution Lobbying: An Austrian Solution - A new law seeks to curb political corruption, but critics view it as another half-hearted attempt ; The Vienna Review; 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
The register is still in the early phase, some deadlines to register end 2014, many lawyers wait for clarification by a court´s decision and did not register.&lt;ref name="OECDComparisonPage" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1363706574781/Lobbying-Register-mit-93-Eintragungen-gestartet Lobbying-Register started; 2013; Newspaper ''Der Standard'' (available in German only)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further countries ===
Further registers have been set up in Australia&lt;ref&gt;[http://lobbyists.pmc.gov.au/who_register.cfm Australian Lobby Register]&lt;/ref&gt; (in the year 2011), Denmark, France (2010), Ireland, Israel (2008), Lithuania (2001), Macedonia (2008), Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tweedekamer.nl/over_de_tweede_kamer/lobbyistenregister/index.jsp Lobbyist Registry Netherland]&lt;/ref&gt; (2012), Poland (2005), Slovenia&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kpk-rs.si/en/lobbying/register-of-lobbyists Lobby Register Slovenia]&lt;/ref&gt; (2010), Taiwan, Hungary (2006-2011).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regulatelobbying.com/ world map with facts about lobby registers]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases long-term-experiences do not yet exist, in some cases the need for improvement is already seen today.&lt;ref Name="CompAnalysisHolmana" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OECDComparisonPage" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2882">The '''London Television archive''' is a [[London]]-based television and film video archive.

It consists of thousands of hours of footage relating to London, from stock shots of famous landmarks such as [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]], [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Westminster Abbey]], to news stories such as [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]' death and state visits to London from dignitaries such as [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Nelson Mandela]].

The main collection of the archive comes from the '''Channel One News Archive''', which was active throughout the 1990s. Hence, '''The London Television Archive''' is particularly strong in cultural 1990 features such as the [[Brit Pop]] explosion, featuring [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and the rise of [[Girl Power]] and the [[Spice Girls]].

It also has website that features art inspired by London, and an alternative tours of London page which features the most important London locations of [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[George Orwell]] and actors such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]].

The archive is predominantly used by film and television production companies, global television news networks, and advertising agencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3018">The '''Madrid Skylitzes''' is a richly illustrated [[illuminated manuscript]] of the ''Synopsis of Histories'' ({{lang|grc|Σύνοψις Ἱστοριῶν}}), by [[John Skylitzes]], which covers the reigns of the Byzantine emperors from the death of [[Nicephorus I]] in 811 to the deposition of [[Michael VI Bringas|Michael VI]] in 1057.  The manuscript was produced in [[Sicily]] in the 12th century, and is now at the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]] in [[Madrid]], with the shelfmark MS Graecus Vitr. 26-2; it widely known as the ''Madrid Skylitzes'', ''Codex Græcus Matritensis Ioannis Skyllitzes'', or ''Skyllitzes Matritensis''. It is the only surviving illustrated manuscript of a Greek chronicle, and includes 574 miniatures.

It is unclear whether these illustrations are copies of earlier Byzantine images or were newly created specifically for this copy.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[File:John Henry Fuseli - The Nightmare.JPG|thumb|300px|''[[The Nightmare]]'', by [[Henry Fuseli]], 1781]]

A '''Mare''' ({{lang-ang|mære}}, {{lang-odt|mare}}; {{lang|non|mara}} in [[Old High German]] and [[Old Norse]]) is a malicious entity in [[Germanic folklore|Germanic]] and [[Slavic folklore|Slavic]] [[folklore]] that rides on people's chests while they sleep, bringing on bad dreams (or "[[nightmare]]s").&lt;ref name=BJORVAND719&gt;Bjorvand and Lindeman (2007), pp. 719–720.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "mare" comes (through [[Middle English]] ''mare'') from [[Old English]] ''mære'', ''mare'', or ''mere'', all feminine nouns. These in turn come from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*marōn''. ''*Marōn'' is the source of  {{lang-non|mara}}, from which are derived {{lang-sv|mara}}; {{lang-is|mara}}; {{lang-fo|marra}}; {{lang-da|mare}}; {{lang-no|mare}}''/mara'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ({{lang|nl|nacht}}){{lang|nl|merrie}}, and [[German language|German]]: ({{lang|de|Nacht}})''{{lang|de|mahr}}''. The ''-mar'' in [[French language|French]] ''cauchemar'' ("nightmare") is borrowed from the Germanic through [[Old French]] ''mare''.&lt;ref name=BJORVAND719/&gt;

The word may ultimately be traced back to the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] ''*mer-'', "to rub away" or "to harm".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE326.html mer-] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910021749/http://bartleby.com/61/roots/IE326.html |date=2005-09-10 }}" in Pickett et al. (2000). Retrieved on 2008-11-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian folklorist [[Éva Pócs]] endorses an alternative etymology, tracing the core term back to the [[Greek languages|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μόρος}} (Indo-European *''moros''), meaning "death".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pócs|1999|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haunted Land 2001, p 78"&gt;Devereux (2001), ''Haunted Land'', p.78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|mo/ros|μόρος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norwegian and Danish, the words for "nightmare" are ''mareritt'' and ''mareridt'' respectively, which can be directly translated as "mare-ride". The Icelandic word ''martröð'' has the same meaning (-''tröð'' from the verb ''troða'', "trample", "stamp on", related to "tread"), whereas the Swedish ''mardröm'' translates as "mare-dream".

== Beliefs ==

The mare was also believed to "ride" horses, which left them exhausted and covered in sweat by the morning. She could also entangle the hair of the sleeping man or beast, resulting in "marelocks", called ''marflätor'' ("mare-braids") or ''martovor'' ("mare-tangles") in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] or ''marefletter'' and ''marefloker'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. The belief probably originated as an explanation to the [[Polish plait]] phenomenon, a hair disease.

Even trees were thought to be ridden by the mare, resulting in branches being entangled. The undersized, twisted [[pine|pine-trees]] growing on coastal rocks and on wet grounds are known in Sweden as ''martallar'' ("mare-pines") or in German as ''Alptraum-Kiefer'' ("nightmare pine").

According to  [[Paul Devereux]], mares included witches who took on the form of animals when their spirits went out and about while they were in trance (see the Icelandic example of Geirrid, below). These included animals such as frogs, cats, horses, hares, dogs, oxen, birds and often bees and wasps.&lt;ref name="Haunted Land 2001, p 78"/&gt;

The mare is attested as early as in the Norse ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' from the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Ynglinga saga'', chapter 13 (and quoted stanza from ''Ynglingatal''), in Hødnebø and Magerøy (1979), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Here, King [[Vanlandi|Vanlandi Sveigðisson]] of [[Uppsala]] lost his life to a nightmare (''mara'') conjured by the [[Finns|Finnish]] sorceress [[Huld]] or Hulda, hired by the king's abandoned wife [[Drífa]]. The king had broken his promise to return within three years, and after ten years had elapsed the wife engaged the sorceress to either lure the king back to her, or failing that, to assassinate him. Vanlandi had scarcely gone to sleep when he complained that the nightmare "rode him;" when the men held the king's head it "trod on his legs" on the point of breaking, and when the retinue then "seized his feet" the creature fatally "pressed down on his head." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Hollander|1964}}|author=Snorri Sturluson|others=Hollander, Lee M. (tr.)|title=Heimskringla: History of the Kings of Norway|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2010|origyear=1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71U7xXIBbUgC&amp;pg=PA16|isbn=0292786964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Vatnsdæla saga]]'', Thorkel Silver ({{lang|is|Þorkell Silfri}}) has a dream about riding a red horse that barely touched ground, which he interpreted as a positive omen, but his wife disagreed, explaining that a mare signified a man's [[Fetch (folklore)|fetch]] (''[[fylgja]]''), and that the red color boded bloodiness. This association of the nightmare with fetch is thought to be of late origin, an interpolation in the text dating to circa 1300, with the text exhibiting a "confounding of the words ''marr'' and ''mara''."&lt;ref name="kelchner"&gt;{{cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Kelchner|1935}}|last=Kelchner|first=Georgia Dunham|title=Dreams in Old Norse Literature and their Affinities in Folklore|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|origyear=1935|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=ja&amp;lr=&amp;id=eXMoAAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA20|pages=20&amp;ndash;22|isbn=1107620228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible example is the account in the ''[[Eyrbyggja saga]]'' of the sorceress Geirrid accused of assuming the shape of a "night-rider" or "ride-by-night" (''marlíðendr'' or ''kveldriða'') and causing serious trampling bruises on Gunnlaug Thorbjornsson. The ''marlíðendr'' mentioned here has been equated to the ''mara'' by commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Morris|first1=William|last2=Magnússon|first2=Eiríkr|title=The Story of the Ere-dwellers (Eyrbyggja Saga)|publisher=B.

As in English, the name appears in the word for "nightmare" in the [[North Germanic languages|Nordic languages]] (e.g. the Swedish word "mardröm" literally meaning mara-dream, the Norwegian word "mareritt" and the Danish "Mareridt", both meaning Mare-ride or the Icelandic word "martröð" meaning mara-dreaming repeatedly).

=== Germany ===
In Germany they were known as ''mara'', ''mahr'', ''mare''.

German Folklorist [[Franz Felix Adalbert Kuhn]] records a [[Westphalia]]n charm or prayer used to ward off mares, from Wilhelmsburg near [[Paderborn]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such charms are preceded by the example of the ''Münchener Nachtsegen'' of the fourteenth century (See [[Elf]] under [[Elf#Medieval and early modern German texts|§Medieval and early modern German texts]]). Its texts demonstrates that certainly by the [[Late Middle Ages]], the distinction between the ''mare'', the [[Alp (folklore)|alp]], and the ''trute'' ([[drude]]) was being blurred, the mare being described as the alp's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref=harv|last=Hall|first=Alaric|title=Elves in Anglo-Saxon England: Matters of Belief, Health, Gender and Identity|publisher=Boydell Press|year=2007|isbn=1843832941|url=http://www.libgen.net/view.php?id=383363|pages=125&amp;ndash;6}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slavic countries ===
In [[Polish folklore]], ''zmora'' or ''mara'' are the souls of living people that leave the body during the night, and are seen as wisps of straw or hair or as moths. Accordingly, [[Polish language|Polish]] ''mara'', [[Czech language|Czech]] ''můra'' denote both a kind of elf or spirit as well as a "[[sphinx moth]]" or "night butterfly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grimm|1883|loc=''TM'' '''2''', 464, note2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Slavic languages]] with cognates that have the double meaning of [[moth]] are: [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] ''mòra'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Sychta]]. Słownik gwar kaszubskich na tle kultury ludowej, Ossolineum, Wrocław - Warszawa - Kraków 1969, tom III, pp. 102-105&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''mora''.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In the north-western Russian and South-Russian traditions, the mara means a female character, similar to [[Kikimora|kikimora]]. Mara is usually invisible, but can take the form of a woman with long flowing hair, which she combs, sitting on a yarn. According to other sources, the mara is black, shaggy (olonets, tul.), And also a terrible and disheveled creature (Kaluga).

In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], ''mora'' refers to a "nightmare". ''Mora'' or ''Mara'' is one of the spirits from ancient Slav mythology. Mara was a dark spirit that takes a form of a beautiful woman and then visits men in their dreams, torturing them with desire, and dragging life out of them. In Serbia, a mare is called ''mora'', or ''noćnik/noćnica'' ("night creature", masculine and feminine respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pócs|1999|p=33}} gives the feminine form.&lt;/ref&gt; In Romania they were known as ''[[Moroi]]''.

It is a common belief that ''mora'' enters the room through the keyhole, sits on the chest of the sleepers and tries to strangle them (hence ''moriti'', "to torture", "to bother", "to strangle", "umoriti", "to tire", "to kill", "umor", "tiredness" and "umoran", "tired"). To repel ''moras'', children are advised to look at the window or to turn the pillow and make a sign of cross on it (''prekrstiti jastuk''); in the early 19th century, [[Vuk Karadžić]] mentions that people would repel ''moras'' by leaving a broom upside down behind the door, or putting their belt on top of their sheets, or saying an elaborate prayer poem before they go to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Karadžić|first=Vuk|authorlink=Vuk Karadžić|title=Srpski rječnik|year=1898|origyear=1818|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b4d-AAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential analogues ===
In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the creature is known as ''éjjeljáró'' or "night-goer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pócs|1999|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Estonia]], the mare-like spirit is called ''Painaja'' (presser) or ''Külmking'' (cold-shoe).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In [[Thailand]], this phenomenon is well documented and called ผีอำ (pee ahm), pee meaning "ghost". Buddhist residents wear amulets (พระเครื่อง) blessed by monks to ward off spirits such as these. In [[Turkey]], the mare is known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Karabasan|tr}} (ominous-presser).

&lt;/div&gt;
The '''Michel catalog''' (''MICHEL-Briefmarken-Katalog'') is the largest and best-known [[stamp catalog]] in the [[German language|German]]-speaking world. First published in 1910, it has become an important reference work for [[philately]], with information not available in the English-language [[Scott catalog]].

==Origins==
The catalog started out as a price list for the dealer [[Hugo Michel]] of [[Apolda]]. By 1920 it was split into two volumes, for "Europe" and "overseas", and eventually grew to a present-day size of about a dozen volumes covering the entire world, with additional specialized volumes bringing the total to some forty catalogs.

==Scope==
It extensively covers specialized Germany collecting including the complex WW2 era stamps of Germany, occupied territories, and [[provisional stamps]].

Unlike Scott, Michel does not issue a complete set of catalogs every year, instead updating only several of the volumes. Michel is also more detailed, with quantities issued, sheet formats, and so forth. Also of significance to some collectors is its coverage of countries and periods omitted by Scott for editorial or political reasons. For instance, US embargoes against Cuba, Iraq, and North Korea are reflected by Scott's failure to show market values for those countries' stamp issues (as late as 2002, Scott did not supply any information at all about North Korean stamps), and Michel is one of few sources for that information.

Michel also documents stamps issued apparently with little or no intent of being used to pay postage and stamps issued by regions or areas with dubious political status. Scott excludes many issues that were unlikely to be actually used to pay postage.

==Catalogue publications==
There are 15 main catalogues, all issued in German; about 400,000 are printed annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briefmarken.de/images/PDF/NEWS/Introduction_Englisch.pdf| title=Michel Stamp Catalogues. An Introduction to English-speaking readers |publisher=Schwaneberger Verlag, Munich |accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their information is also accessible on the Michel internet pages.
=== Germany ===
The standard Germany catalogue (Michel-Deutschland-Katalog) covers all  German stamps issues . A more detailed specialized catalogue is available. For young collectors a simplified  "Junior Catalogue" is available. All these catalogues are published on an annual basis.

=== Europe ===
Called "Europa-Katalog (EK)" these catalogues appear annually and are divided as follows:
* EK1 West and Central Europe
* EK2 Southern Europe 
* EK3 North and Northwest  Europe 
* EK4 Eastern Europe

=== Overseas ===
Called "Übersee-Katalog (ÜK)" these catalogues appear about every three years. As of 2014 there are 10 issues, some in two volumes. In contrast to the European catalogues the number of stamps printed is not indicated. Not all issues are represented by images. 
* ÜK1  North and Central America
* ÜK2 Caribbean Islands
* ÜK3  South America 
* ÜK4 North and East Africa 
* ÜK5  West Africa 
* ÜK6 Southern Africa 
* ÜK7 Australia, Oceania, Antarctic Territories
* ÜK8  South and Southeast Asia 
* ÜK9  Central and East Asia
* ÜK10 Middle East

=== Other stamp catalogues ===
Aside from Germany, a number of other countries are covered in specialized catalogues that indicate more details such as variations and first day cancellation. Specialized catalogues are available for Austria, Switzerland and Lichtenstein, Great Britain, United States, Croatia, and the United Nations. In addition, other philatelic titles are published.
&lt;ref&gt;Gesamtausgabeprogramm 2009/10 der Michel-Kataloge, Verlag Schwaneberger GmbH&lt;/ref&gt;

==English issues==
Recently Michel publishers (Schwaneberger Verlag) has issued some English-language titles, viz.:

- ''Gulf States'' (2006, all colour focussed on the Arabian semi-island from Abu Dhabi-Yemen inc. the "sheikhdom issues");
''
- Germany Specialized'' Vol. 1 (2007, empire, colonies ec. up to 1945), Vol. 2 (2009, WWII and aftermath inc. related as Generalgouvernement, allied occ. zones); not covered up to now old German states and post-1949, probably in a Vol. 3. The Germany specializeds are issued in co-operation with the APS affiliate [[German Philatelic Society]].

'''Multiracial''' is defined as made up of or relating to people of many [[race (human categorization)|races]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/multiracial |title=Definition of ''multiracial'' in English |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2013 |website=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many terms exist for people of various multiracial backgrounds. Some of the terms are considered insulting and offensive. Preferred terms include ''mixed race'' (or simply ''mixed''), ''multiracial'', ''biracial'', ''multiethnic'', ''polyethnic'', ''half'', ''half-and-half'', ''[[Métis]]'', ''[[Creole peoples|Creole]]'', ''[[mestizo]]'', ''[[mulatto]]'', ''[[Melungeon]]'', ''[[Criollo people|Criollo]]'', ''[[quadroon]]'', ''[[zambo]]'', ''[[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]]'', ''[[hapa]]'', ''[[hāfu]]'', ''[[garifuna]]'' and ''[[pardo]]''.

Individuals of multiracial backgrounds make up a significant portion of the population in many parts of the world. In [[North America]], studies have found that the multiracial population is continuing to grow. In many countries of [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], people with multiracial backgrounds make up the majority of the population. Other countries where multiracial people make up a sizable portion of the population are the [[United Kingdom]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Fiji]].

==Definitions==

[[Race and genetics#Defining race|While defining race is controversial]],&lt;ref&gt;"Not surprisingly, biomedical scientists are divided in their opinions about race. Some characterize it as 'biologically meaningless' or 'not based on scientific evidence', whereas others advocate the use of race in making decisions about medical treatment or the design of research studies." {{cite journal

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
''race'' remains a commonly used term for categorization. Insofar as race is defined differently in different cultures, perceptions of multiraciality will naturally be subjective.

According to U.S. sociologist [[Troy Duster]] and ethicist Pilar Ossorio:

{{quote|Some percentage of people who look white will possess genetic markers indicating that a significant majority of their recent ancestors were African. Some percentage of people who look black will possess genetic markers indicating the majority of their recent ancestors were European.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Abraham, [http://www.racesci.org/racescinow/genetics,race,and%20ancestry/6.html "Molecular Eyewitness: DNA Gets a Human Face"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605145510/http://www.racesci.org/racescinow/genetics%2Crace%2Cand%20ancestry/6.html |date=5 June 2008 }} (quoted from ''Globe and Mail'', 25 June 2005), ''RaceSci''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the United States:

{{quote|Many state and local agencies comply with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 1997 revised standards for the collection, tabulation, and presentation of federal data on race and ethnicity. The revised OMB standards identify a minimum of five racial categories: [[White American|White]]; [[African American|Black or African American]]; [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian and Alaska Native]]; [[Asian American|Asian]]; and [[Pacific Islander American|Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander]]. Perhaps the most significant change for Census 2000 was that respondents were given the option to mark one or more races on the questionnaire to indicate their racial identity. [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census#Census 2000|Census 2000]] race data are shown for people who reported a race either alone or in combination with one or more other races.&lt;ref name=MRDSF&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/archives/files/MRSF-01-US1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040918181635/http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/files/MRSF-01-US1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 September 2004 |title=Modified Race Data Summary File |work=2000 Census of Population and Housing |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=30 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Related terms===
In the [[English-speaking world]], many terms for people of various multiracial backgrounds exist, some of which are pejorative or are no longer used. ''[[Mulato]]'', ''[[zambo]]'' and ''[[mestizo]]'' are used in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''[[mulato]]'', ''[[caboclo]]'', ''cafuzo'', ''ainoko'' (from [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) and ''[[mestiço]]'' in Portuguese and ''mulâtre'' and ''[[métis]]'' in [[French language|French]] for people of multiracial descent. These terms are also in certain contexts used in the English-speaking world. In [[Canada]], the [[Métis people|Métis]] are a recognized ethnic group of mixed European and [[First Nation]] descent, who have status in the law similar to that of First Nations.

Terms such as ''mulatto'' for people of partially African descent and ''mestizo'' for people of partially Native American descent are still used by English-speaking people of the western hemisphere,{{citation needed|reason=which country ie. AE or BE etc.|date=July 2011}} but mostly when referring to the past or to the demography of [[Latin America]] and its diasporic population. ''[[Half-breed]]'' is a historic term that referred to people of partial Native American ancestry; it is now considered pejorative and discouraged from use. [[Mestee]], once widely used, is now used mostly for members of historically mixed-race groups, such as Louisiana Creoles, [[Melungeon]]s, [[Redbone (ethnicity)|Redbones]], [[Brass Ankles]] and [[Mayles]]. In South Africa, and much of English-speaking southern Africa, the term ''Coloured'' was used to describe a mixed-race person and also Asians not of African descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Power!: Black Workers, Their Unions and the Struggle for Freedom in South Africa|author1=Denis MacShane|author2=Martin Plaut|author3=David Ward|publisher=[[South End Press]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0-89608-244-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rLrJ-_78SB0C&amp;pg=PA7 7]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rLrJ-_78SB0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the term is socially accepted, it is becoming an outdated due to its association with the [[apartheid]] era.

In Latin America, where mixtures became tri-racial after the introduction of African slavery, a panoply of terms developed during the colonial period, including terms such as ''[[zambo]]'' for persons of Amerindian and African descent. Charts and diagrams intended to explain the classifications were common. The well-known ''[[Casta]]'' paintings in Mexico and, to some extent, Peru, were illustrations of the different classifications.

At one time, Latin American census categories have used such classifications, but in Brazilian censuses since the [[Empire of Brazil|Imperial times]], for example, most persons of multiracial heritage, except the [[Asian Brazilian]]s of some [[European Brazilian|European descent]] (or any other to the extent it is not clearly perceptible) and vice versa, tend to be thrown into the single category of "[[pardo]]", although [[Race in Brazil|race lines in Brazil]] do not denote ancestry but phenotype, and as such a westernized Amerindian of [[copper (color)|copper-colored]] skin is also a "pardo", a ''caboclo'' in this case, despite being not multiracial, but a European-looking person with one or more African or Indigenous American ancestor is not a "pardo" but a "branco", or a [[white Brazilian]]. The same applies to "negros" or [[Afro-Brazilian]]s and European or Amerindian ancestors. Most Brazilians of all racial groups (except Asian-Brazilians and natives) are to some extent mixed-race according to genetic research.

In English, the terms ''[[miscegenation]]'' and ''[[amalgamation (history)|amalgamation]]'' were used for unions between whites, blacks, and other ethnic groups. These terms are now often considered offensive and are becoming obsolete.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The terms ''mixed-race'', ''biracial'' or ''multiracial'' are becoming generally accepted. In other languages, translations of miscegenation did not become [[politically incorrect]].

In the [[United States]], the 2000 census was the first in the history of the country to offer respondents the option of identifying themselves as belonging to more than one race. This multiracial option was considered a necessary adaptation to the demographic and cultural changes that the United States has been experiencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2005 |title=The New Race Question: How The Census Counts Multiracial Individuals |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation |isbn=0871546582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiracial [[Americans]] officially numbered 6.1 million in 2006, or 2.0% of the population.&lt;ref name=b02001&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=dt&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2006_EST_G2000_B02001&amp;-tree_id=306&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-currentselections=ACS_2006_EST_G2000_B02001&amp;-currentselections=ACS_2006_EST_G2000_B02003&amp;-currentselections=ACS_2006_EST_G2000_C02003&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-geo_id=02000US1&amp;-geo_id=02000US2&amp;-geo_id=02000US3&amp;-geo_id=02000US4&amp;-search_results=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en |title=B02001.

Prior to the mid-20th century, many people hid their multiracial heritage. The development of binary thinking about race meant that African Americans, a high proportion of whom have also had European ancestry, were classified as black. Some are now reclaiming additional ancestries. Many Americans today are multi-racial without knowing it. According to the Census Bureau, as of 2002, over 75% of all [[African American]]s had multiracial ancestries.&lt;ref name="Quintana"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Stephen M. Quintana|editor2=Clark McKown|title=Handbook of Race, Racism, and the Developing Child|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0470189800|page=211|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=d34N68eY-3QC|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the number of Americans who checked both "black" and "white" on their census forms was 134 percent higher than it had been a decade earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1953/multi-race-2010-census-obama|title=Multi-Race and the 2010 Census|accessdate=26 April 2011 |last=Cohn|first=D'Vera }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[James P. Allen]] and Eugene Turner from [[California State University, Northridge]], by some calculations in the 2000 Census, the multiracial population that is part white is as follows:
*white/Native American and [[Alaskan Native]]: 7,015,017,
*white/African American: 737,492,
*white/Asian: 727,197 and
*white/Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander: 125,628.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csupomona.edu/~mreibel/2000_Census_Files/Allen-Turner.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002234040/http://www.csupomona.edu/~mreibel/2000_Census_Files/Allen-Turner.doc |archivedate=2 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stigma of a mixed race heritage, associated with racial discrimination among numerous racial groups, has decreased significantly in the United States. People of mixed-race heritage can identify themselves now in the U.S. Census by any combination of races, whereas before Americans were required to select from only one category. For example, in 2010, they were offered choices of one or more racial categories from the following list:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2009/questionnaire.aspx|title=The 2010 Census Questionnaire: Seven Questions for Everyone|publisher=Population Reference Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mixed raced Americans use the term ''biracial''. The U.S. has a growing multiracial identity movement, reflective of a desire by people to claim their full identities. [[Interracial marriage]], most notably between whites and blacks, was historically deemed immoral and illegal in most states in the 18th, 19th and first half of the 20th century, due to its long association of blacks with the slave caste. [[California]] and the [[Western United States|western US]] had similar laws to prohibit European-Asian marriages, which was associated with discrimination against Chinese and Japanese on the West Coast. Many states eventually repealed such laws and a 1967 decision by the US Supreme Court (''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'') overturned all remaining [[anti-miscegenation laws]] in the US.

The United States is one of the most racially diverse countries in the world. The American people are mostly multi-ethnic descendants of various immigrant nationalities culturally distinct in their former countries. [[Cultural assimilation|Assimilation]] and [[Racial integration|integration]] took place, unevenly at different periods of history, depending on the American region. The "Americanization" of foreign ethnic groups and the inter-racial diversity of millions of Americans has been a fundamental part of its history, especially on frontiers where different groups of people came together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The former President of the United States, [[Barack Obama]], is a multiracial American, as he is the son of a [[European Americans|European American]] mother and a [[Luo people (Kenya)|Luo]] father from Kenya. He acknowledges both parents. His official [[White House]] biography describes him as [[African Americans|African American]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama|title=President Barack Obama|publisher= whitehouse.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hawai'i, the U.S. state in which he was born, he would be called "[[hapa]]", which is the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word for "mixed ethnic heritage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/uhtoday/spring2007/j402/alanatina.html|title=The Hapa Project: How multiracial identity crosses oceans|publisher=''UH Today''|date=Spring 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiracial Canadians in 2006 officially totaled 1.5% of the population, up from 1.2% in 2001, although, this number may actually be far higher. The official mixed-race population grew by 25% since the previous census. Of these, the most frequent combinations were ''multiple visible minorities'' (for example, people of mixed black and south Asian heritage form the majority, specifically in [[Toronto]]), followed closely by ''white-black'', ''white-Chinese'', ''white-Arab'', and many other smaller mixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=97-562-XCB2006007&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=0&amp;IPS=97-562-XCB2006007&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=&amp;PID=92334&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=&amp;StartRow=&amp;SUB=&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=80&amp;VID=&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF= |title=Population Groups (28) and Sex (3) for the Population of Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, 2006 Census – 20% Sample Data |date=12 June 2008 |work=2006 Census: Data Products |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=14 July 2008 |format= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204144216/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=97-562-XCB2006007&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=0&amp;IPS=97-562-XCB2006007&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=&amp;PID=92334&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=&amp;StartRow=&amp;SUB=&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=80&amp;VID=&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF= |archivedate=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of [[slavery in the United States]], a very large but unknown number of African American slaves escaped to Canada, where [[slavery in Canada|slavery]] was made illegal in 1834, via the [[Underground Railroad]]. Many of these people married in with Native Canadian and European-Canadian populations, although their precise numbers and the numbers of their descendants, are not known.

Another 1.2% of Canadians officially are [[Métis in Canada|Métis]] (descendants of a historical population who were partially [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]]—also called "Indian" or "Native"—and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]], particularly [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[French people|French]] ethnic groups). Although listed as a single "race" in Canada, the Métis are therefore multi-racial. In particular the Métis population may be far higher than the official numbers state, due to earlier racism causing people to historically hide their mixed heritage. This however is changing, although many Canadians may now be unaware of their mixed race heritage, especially those of Métis descent.

[[Mestizo]] is the common word used to describe multiracial people in [[Latin America]], especially people with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[Spaniards|Spanish]] or other European ancestry. Mestizos make up a large portion of Latin Americans, comprising a majority in many countries.

In Latin America, racial mixture was officially acknowledged from colonial times. There was official nomenclature for every conceivable mixture present in the various countries. Initially, this classification was used as a type of [[caste]] system, where rights and privileges were accorded depending on one's official racial classification. Official caste distinctions were abolished in many countries of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking [[Americas]] as they became independent of Spain. Several terms have remained in common usage.

Race and racial mixture have played a significant role in the politics of many Latin American countries. In most countries, for example [[Mexico]], [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Panama]], a majority of the population can be described as biracial or multiracial (depending on the country). In [[Demographics of Mexico#Mestizo|Mexico]], over 80% of the population is [[mestizo]] in some degree or another.&lt;ref name="INMEGEN"&gt;[Silva-Zolezzi I., Hidalgo-Miranda A., Estrada-Gil J., Fernandez-Lopez J.C., Uribe-Figueroa L., Contreras A., Balam-Ortiz E., del Bosque-Plata L., Velazquez Fernandez D., Lara C., Goya R., Hernandez-Lemus E., Davila C., Barrientos E., March S., Jimenez-Sanchez G. Analysis of genomic diversity in Mexican Mestizo populations to develop genomic medicine in Mexico. ''Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A''. 2009 May 26;106(21):8611-6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican philosopher and educator [[José Vasconcelos]] authored an essay on the subject, ''[[La Raza Cósmica]]'', celebrating racial mixture. [[Venezuela]]n ex-president [[Hugo Chávez]], himself of Spanish, indigenous and African ancestry, made positive references to the mixed race ancestry of most Latin Americans from time to time.

Colonialism throughout the [[West Indies]] has created diverse populations on many islands, including people of multiracial identities. Of note is the mixture of [[Afro-Caribbean|West African communities]], most brought to the region as slaves and [[Indo-Caribbeans|East Indian]] settlers most of whom came as indentured labor after the abolition of slavery. [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]] and [[Suriname]] claim the highest populations of such mixtures, known locally as ''[[dougla]]s''. In addition to mixed [[Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians|African]] and [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Indian]] heritage, inhabitants of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] can also have any combination of [[Amerindian]], [[Latino]], [[White Trinidadian and Tobagonian|European]], [[Chinese Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Chinese]], [[Arabs|Arab]] and [[Jews|Jewish]] heritage.

====Brazil====
{{main article|Pardo Brazilians|Mixed-race Brazilian}}
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
According to the 2000 official census, 38.5% of [[Brazilians]] identified themselves as [[pardo]] skin color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2000/populacao/cor_raca_Censo2000.pdf|format=PDF|title=Censo Demográfico 2000|publisher=Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística|language=Portuguese|accessdate=14 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That option is normally marked by [[Brazil#Ethnicity|people that consider themselves multiracial]] (''mestiço''). The [[Mixed Race Day]] or Mestizo Day (Dia do Mestiço), on 27 June, is official event in States of Amazonas, Roraima e Paraíba and a holyday in two cities. The term ''pardo'' is formally used in the official census but is not used by the population. In Brazilian society, most people who are multiracial call themselves ''moreno'': light-''moreno'' or dark-''moreno''. These terms are not considered offensive and focus more on skin color than on ethnicity (it is considered more like other human characteristics such as being short or tall).

The most common multiracial groups are between European and African (''[[mulatto]]'') and Amerindian and European (''[[caboclo]]'' or ''mameluco''). But there are also African and Amerindian (''cafuzo'') and East Asian (mostly Japanese) and European/other (''ainoko'' or more recently, ''[[hafu]]''). All groups are more or less found throughout the whole country. Brazilian multiracials with the following three origins, Amerindian, European and African, make up the majority. It is said today{{who|date=September 2016}} that 89% or even more of the "Pardo" population in Brazil has at least one Amerindian ancestor (most of ''brancos'' or White Brazilian population have some Amerindian or African ancestry too despite nearly half of the country's population self-labeling as "Caucasian" in the censuses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} In Brazil, it is very common for Mulattoes to claim that they don't have any Amerindian ancestry, though studies have found{{who|date=September 2016}} that if a Brazilian multiracial can trace their ancestry to nearly 8 to 9 generations back, they will have at least one Amerindian ancestor from their maternal side of the family.

Since multiracial relations in Brazilian society have occurred for many generations, some people find it difficult to trace their own ethnic ancestry. Today a majority of mixed-race Brazilians do not really know their ethnic ancestry. Due to their unique features that makes them Brazilian-looking like skin color, lips and nose shape or hair texture, they are only aware that their ancestors were probably Portuguese, African or Amerindian. Also there was a very large number of other Europeans (counted in the millions) who contributed to the Brazilian racial make up, Japanese (the largest Japanese population outside Japan), Italian (the largest Italian population outside Italy) Lebanese (the largest population of Lebanese outside Lebanon), Germans, Poles and Russians. There is also a high percentage of Brazilians of Jewish descent, perhaps hundreds of thousands, mostly found in the northeast of the country who cannot be sure of their ancestry as they descend from the so-called "Crypto-Jews" (Jews who practiced Judaism in secret while outwardly pretending to be Catholics, also called Marranos or New-Christians, often considered Portuguese); according to some sources, 1 out of every 3 families to arrive there from Portugal during the colonization was of Jewish origin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

There is a high level of integration between all groups. However, there exists a great social and economic difference between European descendants (found more among the upper and middle classes) and African, Amerindian and multiracial descendants (found more among the lower classes), what is called [[Brazilian apartheid]].

===United Kingdom===

In 1991 an analysis of the census showed that 50% of black Caribbean men born in the UK have white partners,&lt;ref&gt;France Winddance Twine. ''A White Side of Black Britain.'' Durham, Duke UP, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2011 BBC documentary ''Mixed Britannia'' noted that 1 in 10 British children are growing up in interracial households. 
 
In 2000, ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' reported that "Britain has the highest rate of interracial relationships in the world" and certainly the UK has the highest rate in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;John Harlow, ''The Sunday Times'' (London), 9 April 2000, quoting Professor Richard Berthoud of the Institute for Social and Economic Research&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 census showed the population of England to be 1.4% mixed-race, compared with 2.7% in Canada and 1.4% in the U.S. estimates of 1.4% in 2002, although this U.S. figure did not include mixed-race people who had a black parent. Both the US and UK have fewer people identifying as mixed race, however, than Canada. By 2020 the mixed-race population is expected to become Britain's largest ethnic minority group with the highest growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2002/race/changing_face_of_britain.stm ''Changing Face of Britain''], BBC, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, many multi-racial people have [[British African-Caribbean community|Caribbean]], [[Ethnic groups in Africa|African]] or [[British Asian|Asian]] heritage. For example, supermodel [[Naomi Campbell]], who has [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]], and [[Asia]]n roots. Some, like 2008 [[Formula One]] World Champion, [[Lewis Hamilton]], are referred to or describe themselves as '[[mixed British|mixed]]'.&lt;!-- The majority of mixed-race Britons identified themselves as 'mixed-race' on the 2001 census.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}appears to be refuted by http://www.statistics.gov.uk/lib2001/Section3597.html --&gt;

The [[2001 UK Census]] included a section entitled 'Mixed' to which 1.4% (1.6% by 2005 estimates) of people responded, which was split further into ''White and Black Caribbean, White and Asian, White and Black African'' and ''Other Mixed''. Despite this, 2005 birth records for the country state at least 3.5% of newborn babies as mixed race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1050593/Only-babies-born-England-Wales-white-British.html|title=Only two in three babies born in England and Wales are white British|website=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Africa, a large number of multiracial communities can also be found. Among these are the [[Haratin]] oasis-dwellers of Saharan southern [[Morocco]], Algeria and [[Mauritania]]. They are believed to be a mixture of [[Black people|Black Africans]] and [[Berber people|Berbers]], and constitute a socially and ethnically distinct group.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Bridget Anderson, ''World Directory of Minorities'' (Minority Rights Group International: 1997), p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

[O]ur results confirmed that admixture in Malagasy was due to the encounter of people surfing the extreme edges of two of the broadest historical waves of language expansion: the Austronesian and Bantu expansions. In fact, all Madagascan living groups show a mixture of uniparental lineages typical of present African and South East Asian populations with only a minor contribution of Y lineages with different origins."&lt;/ref&gt; Years of intermarriages created the [[Malagasy people]], who primarily speak [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], an [[Austronesian]] language with [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] influences.&lt;ref name="Tofanelli"/&gt;

In [[South Africa]], the [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949|Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act]] of 1949 prohibited marriage between Whites (people of European descent) and non-Whites (being classified as African, Asian and [[Coloured]]). It was repealed in 1985.

Multiracial South Africans are commonly referred to as [[coloured]]s.

===Central Asia===

Today, many Central Asian populations are an amalgamation of various peoples such as Mongols, Turkics, and Iranians. The Mongol invasion of Central Asia in 13th century resulted in the massacre of the population of Iranians and other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European peoples]] as well as a large degree of intermarriage and assimilation. Genetic studies shows that Central Asian Turkic people and Hazara are a mixture of Northeast Asians and Indo-European people. Caucasian ancestry is prevalent in almost all central Asian Turkic people. Kazakhs, Hazara, Karakalpaks, Crimean Tatars have more European mtdna than European y-dna. Kyrgyz have mostly European y-dna with substantial European mtdna. Other Turkic people like Uyghurs and Uzbeks have mostly European y-dna but also a significantly higher percentage of European mtdna. Turkmen have predominantly European y-dna and mtdna.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |doi=10.1086/342096 |author1=Tatjana Zerjal|author2=R.

====Taiwan====

During the 1662 [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] in which Chinese [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] loyalist forces commanded by [[Koxinga]] besieged and defeated the [[Dutch East India Company]] and conquered Taiwan, the Chinese took Dutch women and children prisoner. The Dutch missionary [[Antonius Hambroek]], two of his daughters, and his wife were among the Dutch prisoners of war with [[Koxinga]]. Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia demanding he persuade them to surrender or else Hambroek would be killed when he returned. Hambroek returned to the Fort, where two of his other daughters were. He urged the Fort not to surrender, and returned to Koxinga's camp. He was then executed by decapitation, and in addition to this, a rumor was spreading among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese, so Koxinga ordered the mass execution Dutch male prisoners in retaliation, in addition to a few women and children also being killed.

===South Asia===

====India====
[[Anglo-Indian]]s are a Eurasian mix which originated in [[India]] during the Colonial period beginning with the French, Dutch, Portuguese and other Europeans who came along with them, continuing during the [[British Raj]] in India. The estimated population of Anglo-Indians is 600,000 worldwide with the majority living in India and the UK.

Article 366(2) of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] defines Anglo-Indian as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/a035833a480e4514802565530037bf7e?OpenDocument "Treaty Bodies Database – Document – State Party Report"] United Nations Human Rights Website. 29 April 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/255331/ |title=Article 366(2) in The Constitution of India 1949|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;(2) an Anglo-Indian means a person whose father or any of whose other male progenitors in the male line is or was of European descent but who is domiciled within the territory of India and is or was born within such territory of parents habitually resident therein and not established there for temporary purposes only;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Goans]] are an assimilation of Indo-Aryan, Eurasian and Luso-Asians ancestries, with many being descendants of the Portuguese, who had a considerable influence on Goa for over 450 years. Many Goans have a considerable amount of Portuguese in them, and tracing back family trees often proves that their family began with Portuguese people who lived many hundreds of years ago. Many Goans today identify their nationality as Portuguese-Goan as they have much Portuguese ancestry and Portuguese surnames.

====Burma====
As with India, [[Burma]] was ruled by the British, from 1826 until 1948. Many European groups vied for control of the country before the British arrived. Intermarriage and mixed-relationships between these settlers and merchants with the local Burmese population, and subsequently between British colonists and the Burmese created a local Eurasian population, known as the [[Anglo-Burmese]]. This group dominated colonial society and through the early years of independence. Most [[Anglo-Burmese]] now reside primarily in Australia, New Zealand and the UK since Burma received her independence in 1948 with an estimated 52,000 left behind in Burma.

====Sri Lanka====
Due to its strategic location in the Indian Ocean, the island of [[Sri Lanka]] has been a confluence for settlers from various parts of the world, which has resulted in the formation of several mixed-race ethnicities in the Island. The most notable mixed-race group are the [[Sri Lankan Moors]], who trace their ancestry from Arab traders who settled on the island and intermarried with local women. Today, The Sri Lankan Moors live primarily in urban communities, preserving their Arab-Islamic cultural heritage while adopting many Southern Asian customs.

The [[Burgher People|Burghers]] are a Eurasian ethnic group, consisting for the most part of male-line descendants of European colonists from the 16th to 20th centuries (mostly Portuguese, Dutch, German and British) and local women, with some minorities of Swedish, Norwegian, French and Irish.

The [[Sri Lanka Kaffir people|Sri Lanka Kaffirs]]  are an ethnic group partially descended from 16th-century Portuguese traders and the African slaves who were brought by them. The Kaffirs spoke a distinctive creole based on Portuguese, the Sri Lanka Kaffir language, now extinct. Their cultural heritage includes the dance styles Kaffringna and Manja, as well as the Portuguese Sinhalese, Creole, Afro-Sinhalese varieties.

===Southeast Asia===

====Singapore and Malaysia====
According to government statistics, the population of [[Singapore]] as of September 2007 was 4.68 million, of whom multiracial people, including [[Chindian]]s and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]], formed 2.4%.

In Singapore and [[Malaysia]], the majority of inter-ethnic marriages are between [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]]. The offspring of such marriages are informally known as "[[Chindian]]", though the Malaysian government only classifies them by their father's ethnicity. As the majority of these intermarriages usually involve an Indian groom and Chinese bride, the majority of Chindians in Malaysia are usually classified as "[[Malaysian Indian|Indian]]" by the Malaysian government. As for the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], who are predominantly [[Muslim]], legal restrictions in Malaysia make it uncommon for them to intermarry with either the Indians, who are predominantly [[Hindu]], or the Chinese, who are predominantly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Daniels |first=Timothy P. |year=2005 |title=Building Cultural Nationalism in Malaysia |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-94971-8 |page=189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, common for Muslims and [[Arab Singaporean|Arabs in Singapore]] and Malaysia to take local Malay wives, due to a common [[Islam]]ic faith.&lt;ref name=Arab-Malays&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arab and native intermarriage in Austronesian Asia|work=ColorQ World|url=http://www.colorq.org/MeltingPot/article.aspx?d=Asia&amp;x=ArabMalays|accessdate=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chitty]] people, in Singapore and the [[Malacca]] state of Malaysia, are [[Tamils]] with considerable Malay descent. This was due to the first Tamil settlers taking local wives, since they did not bring along any of their own women with them.

In the East Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], there have been many incidents of intermarriage between [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] and native tribes such as the [[Murut people|Murut]] and [[Dusun]] in Sabah, and the [[Iban people|Iban]] and [[Bisaya]] in Sarawak. This phenomenon has resulted in a potpourri of cultures in both states where many people claiming to be of native descent have some Chinese blood in them, and many Chinese have native blood in them. The offspring of these mixed marriages are called "Sino-(name of tribe)", e.g. Sino-Dusun. Normally, if the father is Chinese, the offspring will adopt Chinese culture and if the father is native then native culture will be adopted, but this is not always the case. These Sino-natives are usually fluent in [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[English language|English]]. A smaller number are able to speak Chinese dialects and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], especially those who have received education in vernacular Chinese schools.

====Philippines====
{{See also|Filipino mestizo}}
The [[Philippines]] was a [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish colony]] for almost four centuries or 333 years, and by the United States for 46 years. This is the cause of many mixed race Filipinos of [[Spanish Filipino]] and Philippine-American descent.

After the defeat of Spain during the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, the Philippines and other remaining [[Spanish colonies]] were ceded to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]]. The Philippines was under U.S. [[sovereignty]] until 1946, though occupied by Japan during World War II. In 1946, in the [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Treaty of Manila]], the U.S. Recognized the Republic of the Philippines as an independent nation. Even after 1946, the U.S. maintained a heavy military presence in the Philippines, with as many as 21 U.S. military bases and 100,000 U.S. military personnel stationed there. The bases closed in 1992, leaving behind thousands of [[Amerasian]] children.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3693/is_199710/ai_n8759139 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203035557/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3693/is_199710/ai_n8759139 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 February 2009 |title=Women and children, militarism, and human rights: International Women's Working Conference – Off Our Backs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl S.

In the United States, intermarriage among Filipinos with other races is common. They have the largest number of [[interracial marriage]]s among Asian immigrant groups, as documented in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asian-nation.org/interracial.shtml|title=Interracial Dating &amp; Marriage|publisher=asian-nation.org|accessdate=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also noted that 21.8% of Philippine-Americans are of mixed lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asian-nation.org/multiracial.shtml|title=Multiracial / Hapa Asian Americans|publisher=asian-nation.org|accessdate=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vietnam====
Under terms of the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Accords of 1954]], departing French troops took thousands of Vietnamese wives and children with them after the [[First Indochina War]]. Some 100,000 Eurasians stayed in Vietnam, though after independence from French rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808572,00.html SOUTH VIET NAM: The Girls Left Behind]. ''Time''. 10 September 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
The local [[Māori people|Māori]] were joined from the 1840s onward by large numbers of Europeans colonists, and successive waves of other immigrants. Racial mixing is common, including with later Pacific and Asian immigrants, so that the vast majority of New Zealand's half million Māori now also have some other ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.tangatawhenua.com/archives/15885|title=ARCHIVES: 2 Maori mentions in historic US papers - TangataWhenua.com|first=|last=DigitalMaori|date=13 January 2012|website=tangatawhenua.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many who identify as [[Pākehā]] may also have Māori forebears.

At the [[2013 New Zealand census|2013 census]], 11.2 percent of people reported belonging to more than one ethnic group. Younger people were more likely to be multiracial; 22.8 percent of children under 15 reported multiple ethnicities, compared to only 2.6 percent of people 65 and over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 2013 Census QuickStats about culture and identity – Ethnic groups in New Zealand |url= http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/ethnic-groups-NZ.aspx |publisher= [[Statistics New Zealand]] |date= 15 April 2014 |accessdate= 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of mixed-race New Zealanders include opera singer [[Kiri Te Kanawa]], actress [[Rena Owen]], sportsman [[Kees Meeuws]] and former Governor General [[Paul Reeves]].

===Fiji===
[[Fiji]] has long been a multi-ethnic country, with a vast majority of people having multi-racial heritages even if they do not self-identify in that manner. The indigenous Fijians are of mixed Melanesian and Polynesian ancestry, resulting from years of migration of islanders from various places mixing with each other. Fiji Islanders from the Lau group have intermarried with Tongans and other Polynesians over the years. The overwhelming majority of the rest of the indigenous Fijians, though, can be genetically traced to having mixed Polynesian/Melanesian ancestry.

The Indo-Fijian population is also a hodge-podge of South Asian immigrants (called Girmits in Fiji), who came as indentured labourers beginning in 1879. While a few of these labourers managed to bring wives, many of them either took or were given wives once they arrived in Fiji. The Girmits, who are classified as simply "Indians" to this day, came from many parts of the Indian subcontinent of present-day India, Pakistan, and to a lesser degree Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is easy to recognize the Indian mixtures present in Fiji and see obvious traces of Southern and Northern Indians and other groups who have been categorised together. To some degree, even more of this phenomenon would have likely happened if the religious groups represented (primarily Hindu, Muslim and Sikh) had not resisted to some degree marriage between religious groups, which tended to be from more similar parts of the Indian subcontinent.

Over the years, particularly in the sugar cane-growing regions of Western Viti Levu and parts of Vanua Levu, Indo-Fijians and Indigenous Fijians have mixed. Others have Chinese/Fijian ancestry, Indo-Fijian/Samoan or Rotuman ancestry, and European/Fijian ancestry (often called "part-Fijians"). The latter are often descendents of shipwrecked sailors and settlers who came during the colonial period. Migration from a dozen or more different Pacific countries (Tuvalu, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Samoa, and Wallis and Futuna being the most prevalent) have added to the various ethnicities and intermarriages.

The '''''Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China''''' (PPRC), compiled by the [[Pharmacopoeia]] Commission of the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China]], is an official compendium of drugs, covering [[Chinese medicine|Traditional Chinese]] and [[western medicine]]s, which includes information on the standards of purity, description, test, dosage, precaution, storage, and the strength for each drug.

It is recognized by the [[World Health Organization]] as the official Chinese [[pharmacopoeia]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, Index of Pharmacopoeias, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clarify|date=June 2009}}

The 1997 [[English language|English]] version consists of two volumes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byform/mailing-lists/bookarts/2000/07/msg00124.html|title=Conservation OnLine - CoOL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Volume 1 (Herbal medicine), 1997, {{ISBN|7-5025-2062-7}}
# Volume 2 (Western medicine), 1997, {{ISBN|7-5025-2063-5}}

The 1997 [[Chinese language|Chinese]] version (in simplified Chinese) also consists of two volumes, but the English and Chinese versions are not direct translations of each other, as they are organised differently. In the English version, the medicines are arranged in ascending alphabetical order, but in the Chinese version, they are arranged in ascending [[stroke order]].

In the English edition, the 2005 version consists of 3 volumes ({{ISBN|7117069821}}). It is a "compendium of almost all traditional Chinese medicines and most western medicines and preparations. Information is given for each drug on standards of purity, description, test, dosage, precaution, storage and strength. Key features: A total of 2691 monographs: 992 for traditional Chinese medicines and 1699 for modern western drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinicave.com/pd_pharmacopoeia.cfm|title=Pharmacopoeia of The People's Republic of China 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Volume I contains [[monographs]] of Chinese material [[medica]] and pared slice, [[vegetable oil]]/[[fat]] and its extract, Chinese traditional patent medicines, single ingredient of Chinese crude drug preparations etc.;
Volume II deals with monographs of chemical [[drug]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, biochemical preparations, [[Radiopharmaceutical]]s and excipients for pharmaceutical use;
Volume III contains biological products."

'''Philip Conisbee''' (January 3, 1946 – January 16, 2008) was a British-American curator for the American [[National Gallery of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ken (January 25, 2008). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/25/arts/design/25conisbee.html?_r=0 Philip Conisbee, 62, National Gallery Curator, Is Dead]." ''The New York Times''. Retrieved June 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Philip was born in [[Belfast]], the son of Paul Conisbee, but raised in [[London]], being educated at St Dunstan's College in [[Catford]] before earning a BA in European Art at the [[Courtauld Institute]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/mar/13/art.usa|title=Obituary: Philip Conisbee|first=Elizabeth|last=Cropper|date=13 March 2008|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing in academia he received a doctorate for his thesis on the French landscape artist [[Claude Joseph Vernet]] in 1971. From 1971 to 1986 he lectured at [[Leicester University]]. He then moved to America to act as Curator of French Art at the Museum of Fine Art in Boston.

He befriended [[Earl Powell III]] and moved to [[California]] to work with him at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] in 1988. Powell moved to Washington in 1992 and asked Conisbee to join him the following year.

He became a US citizen in 1994.

He rose to be Curator of the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/25/arts/design/25conisbee.html|title=Philip Conisbee - Obituary|first=Ken|last=Johnson|date=4 May 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 he organised one of the country's most successful exhibitions: ''Van Gogh's Van Gogh''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/18/AR2008011803309.html|title=Philip Conisbee; National Gallery Curator|first=Matt|last=Schudel|date=19 January 2008|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Underlinked|date=February 2013}}

A '''procedure''' is a document written to support a "policy directive". A procedure is designed to describe [[5 Ws|who, what, where, when, and why]] by means of establishing [[corporate accountability]] in support of the implementation of a "policy". 

The "how" is further documented by each organizational unit in the form of "work instructions" which aims to further support a procedure by providing greater detail.

==Exemplary procedure==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
As an example, suppose a manufacturing facility established a policy that all overtime shall be approved. A procedure can be created to establish “Who” can approve overtime (ranks, roles &amp; responsibilities), "What" forms or systems must be used, "Where" they are located, "When" overtime is applicable, and "Why" (i.e., the management directive established via a "policy"). The output of a procedure is an input to a "work instruction" (i.e., a set of [[Action (philosophy)|actions]] or operations which must be executed in the same manner in order to achieve intended results under the same circumstances. (For example, in the latter example, the output of the procedure could be further broken down into a work instruction to describe "how" a manager/employee should access the systems for approving/reviewing overtime (e.g., first click on this hyperlink, second press this button, third choose these fields, and fourth click approve/reject).

USAGE EXAMPLES

•The insurance company provides a step-by-step guide to its dispute and complaint procedures for all policy holders to access.

•The Doctor surprised me when he told me that he had used a new procedure to repair the tear in the tendon of my leg.

•In a work place that has complex interactions among employees, it is important to specify and implement a procedure for core processes.

==Specific types of procedures==
In telecommunications, a '''SOP''' ([[Standard Operating Procedure]]) is specifically designed to describe and guide multiple iterations of the same procedure over a broad number of locations, on multiple occasions, and over an open period of time until such '''SOP''' is updated or discontinued. Also used heavily in the telecommunications industry, a '''MOP''' (Method of Procedure) differs from a '''SOP''' in that it contains specific directives for a particular activity, on a particular date, for a specific location,  piece of equipment, or circumstance. In today's business model, wherein telecom providers can be both "provider" and "user", most "user" organizations require a '''MOP''' from the service provider whenever an activity has the potential to cause a traffic-affecting outage. 

The industry standard is &lt;50ms of traffic interruption. If a "switch hit" or traffic interruption is 50 ms or less, it is "transparent" to the bit stream carrying the traffic, and is therefore considered "hitless" and non-traffic affecting.&lt;ref name=undefined&gt;{{cite book|title=The Froehlich/Kent Encyclopedia of Telecommunications, Volume 3; Volume 16 |authors=Froehlich, Fritz E. &amp; [[Allen Kent|Kent, Allen]] &amp; Hall, Carolyn M. |page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manifamsr.jpg|right|thumb|MSR demonstration in 2013.]]
The '''Republican Social Movement''' ({{lang-es|Movimiento Social Republicano}}, '''MSR''') was a [[Third Position|third positionist]] [[political party]] in [[Spain]]. It was registered at the Ministry of Interior on November 30, 1999, with offices in [[Barcelona]]. The following year it merged with Vértice Social Español to form what it called a "Social Patriotic force".

By its members' own admission, as well as by that of the bulk of the far-right public opinion,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050321090806/http://www.libreopinion.com/members/ch1492/english/FascioInSpain.html]&lt;/ref&gt; the MSR was roughly inscribed in what is usually called the [[Third Position]], and adheres to the commonplace strategy of defending socializing (and at times [[leftist]]) doctrines abroad, whereas adopting conservative and anti-immigration stances at a domestic level. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Its slogan was 'Spain-Republic-[[Socialization (economics)|Socialization]]'.

In the VII National Congress all the partecipants decided to terminate the movement's experience. So MSR dissolved itself with an official announcement
30 of January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;title = ''Official communique of Republican Social Movement''|https://movimientosocialrepublicano.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies==
The party has campaigned against [[Immigration to Spain|immigration into Spain]], [[Turkish membership]] of the [[European Union]] and global capitalism. They support a large programme of re-nationalisation of industries such as electricity and transport. In terms of foreign policies the party takes a strongly pro-[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] approach to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Middle East question]], criticising [[Israel]] alleging that the "Zionist army are committing daily crimes against the Palestinian people." In addition to supporting the Venezuelan government of [[Hugo Chavez]], they have also called for the withdrawal of Spanish troops in the Balkans and condemned the American led [[invasion of Iraq]]. In the [[Spanish general election, 2000|2000 General Election]] the party supported the platform of [[España 2000]].

==Press==
The party publishes ''Tribuna de Europa'' and ''Libertad''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5032">A '''search domain''' is a domain used as part of a domain search list. The domain search list, as well as the local domain name, is used by a [[Domain Name System#DNS_resolvers|resolver]] to create a [[Fully qualified domain name|fully qualified domain name (FQDN)]] from a relative name.&lt;ref name="ietf_spec_dn_cf"&gt;{{cite web
|last1=Mockapetris|first1=P.V.
|title=Domain names - concepts and facilities
|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034
|website=IETF Documents
|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]
|accessdate=24 July 2017
|language=en|format=HTML
|doi=10.17487/RFC1034
|date=November 1987
|quote=Relative names are either taken relative to a well known origin, or to a list of domains used as a search list.  Relative names appear mostly at the user interface, where their interpretation varies from implementation to implementation, and in master files, where they are relative to a single origin domain name.  The most common interpretation uses the root "." as either the single origin or as one of the members of the search list, so a multi-label relative name is often one where the trailing dot has been omitted to save typing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose, the local domain name functions as a single-item search list.

==IPv4==

In an IPv4 environment, search domains are often set via DHCPv4, along with the local domain name. The domain search list is configured by the ''Domain Search Option'' (DHCPv4 option number 119), while the local domain name is configured by ''Domain Name'' (DHCPv4 option number 15).&lt;ref name="ietf_spec_dhcp119"&gt;{{cite web

The Windows operating system, however, does not understand the Domain Search Option; as a workaround, many network administrators use Group Policy Objects to set the domain search list for Windows machines.&lt;ref name="mz_ws_dhcp119"&gt;{{cite web

|website=Matt Zuba
|accessdate=22 July 2017
|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IPv6==

In an IPv6 environment, the domain search list is called a DNS Search List (DNSSL) and can be configured by Router Advertisement and DHCP.&lt;ref name="ietf_spec_dnssl"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Droms|first1=Ralph|title=RFC 3646 - DNS Configuration options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3646|website=IETF Documents|publisher=IETF|accessdate=24 July 2017|language=en|format=HTML|doi=10.17487/RFC3646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manually configuring domain search lists==

In Linux it can be defined by editing the ifcfg file corresponding to the network.&lt;ref name="su_resolve-cnf"&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://superuser.com/questions/110808/how-can-i-add-additional-search-domains-to-the-resolv-conf-created-by-dhclient-i/466912
|title=How can I add additional search domains to the resolv.conf created by dhclient in CentOS
|website=Super User
|access-date=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mac OS X]] the setting is located under the [[Domain Name System|DNS]] tab, next to DNS server settings. A similar setting in [[Microsoft Windows]] is the '''Connection-specific DNS Suffix'''.

==Functionality==

When looking up a bare name in DNS, the network stack will add the search domains to it to form fully qualified domain names, and look up those as well.&lt;ref name="a_support_ml_dns"&gt;{{cite web
|title=OS X Mountain Lion: Edit DNS and search domain settings
|url=https://support.apple.com/kb/PH11162
|website=Apple Support
|accessdate=22 July 2017
|date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the domain search list contains "wikipedia.org", typing "en" in the browser will direct the user to "en.wikipedia.org". Some [[Internet Service Provider|ISPs]] add their own search domains via DHCP settings, similar to how they add DNS servers and other networking information; if this is undesired, the user can change this setting to ".local".

At the end of 2010, it had 11,014 members.&lt;ref&gt;Society of Genealogists, ''Annual Report &amp; Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2010''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Until it purchased 37 Harrington Gardens, [[South Kensington]], in 1954, the Society was based in Malet Place, [[Bloomsbury]], London. The constant growth of the library and increasingly cramped building forced the Society to also sell this headquarters and move both to 14 Charterhouse Buildings (constructed in 1968 for storing rolls of silk), in [[Clerkenwell]], [[London]], in July 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''Genealogists' Magazine'' March 1984, vol.21, no.5, p.163-164; June 1984, vol.21, no.6, notice inside front cover. {{ISSN|0016-6391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The Society possesses the largest family history research library in the United Kingdom, accessible to all members without charge and available to be used by the general public on payment of a fee. Society holdings include thousands of [[parish register]] and [[nonconformist register]] copies on microfilm or microfiche or in manuscript, typescript or published form, along with [[tombstone]] inscriptions, [[Will (law)|will]], [[marriage licence]] and [[census]] transcripts and indexes, trade and residential directories and [[poll book]]s (lists of voters), family histories, biographical dictionaries, works on [[apprentices]] and occupations, the armed forces, school and university registers and histories, genealogical journals and many other related works. The library catalogue is available on the Society's web site.

In 2000, the Society made a number of its genealogical datasets available online on the commercial service [[British Origins]], with some free access for Society members. This material is now hosted commercially by [[Findmypast]] with a separate free service to members run by the Society itself on its own web site using the [[Frontis Archive Publishing System]].

==Activities==
[[File:Society of Genealogists.jpg|thumb|The current home of the Society of Genealogists in Charterhouse Buildings off Goswell Road, London]]The emphasis is on [[United Kingdom|British]], [[British Empire]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] sources, but the Society has some sources for most parts of the world.

The Society's Internet suite offers free access to major genealogical websites including Ancestry and Findmypast.

The society runs a programme of lectures, visits, and courses every year, and publishes textbooks, indexes, and a quarterly journal, ''Genealogists' Magazine''. The latter is currently edited by Michael Gandy.

==Prince Michael of Kent Award==
The society's patron is [[Prince Michael of Kent]], after whom the Society has named a prestigious award (created in 2000), granted periodically to a person or organisation which has made an outstanding contribution to genealogy.

'''''The BLT Cookbook''''' is a [[cookbook]] about the preparation of  [[BLT|bacon, lettuce, and tomato]] (BLT) sandwiches. It was written by Michele Anna Jordan and was published by [[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow Cookbooks]] in the United States in June 2003. Jordan is a food writer and has written for ''[[The Press Democrat]]''; ''The BLT Cookbook'' is her 14th published book. She researched the book for ten years and in the process she taste-tested hundreds of variations on the sandwich, describing it as America's most beloved sandwich. She instructs the reader on how to acquire and prepare the best ingredients for the sandwich. The book includes recipes with varying ingredients, though each recipe includes tomatoes. Many recipes in the book are not sandwiches, and include appetizers, soups, salads, and desserts. Jordan also suggests wines to accompany the sandwich.

The book was positively received, and the [[National Pork Board]] highly recommended it.&lt;ref name="lawson" /&gt; A review in ''[[The Detroit News]]'' said that the book includes "mouthwatering recipes",&lt;ref name="lawson" /&gt; and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called it a "neat little book" on the subject.&lt;ref name="saekel" /&gt; The food editor for the ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' wrote that the book's recipes "will surely shake up your next toasted meal".&lt;ref name="pankey" /&gt; The ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'' called it the "definitive book" on the BLT sandwich.&lt;ref name="mitchell" /&gt;

==Content summary==
''The BLT Cookbook'' discusses the author's love of the BLT sandwich,&lt;ref name="peyton" /&gt; which according to Jordan is "America's favorite sandwich".&lt;ref name="okun"&gt;{{cite news| last = Okun | first =  Janice| title =Gourmandise  | work =  [[The Buffalo News]] | page = E2 | date = June 8, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author wrote,  "There are times when the BLT just tastes right, primal and true, the best thing you could ever eat. The play of the salt and acid, the silk of the tomato against the salt crunch of the bacon ... It is sheer delight."&lt;ref name="thym" /&gt; She discusses ways the combination can be used in soups, appetizers, and salads.&lt;ref name="peyton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="okun" /&gt; Recipes are provided for multiple versions of the BLT sandwich.&lt;ref name="peyton" /&gt; Jordan writes that to make the best sandwich, one should select the finest ingredients.&lt;ref name="classic"&gt;{{cite news| last =Milwaukee Journal Sentinel staff | title = Classic BLT sensational summer fare | work = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | location =[[Wisconsin]]  | publisher = Journal Sentinel Inc. | page = 04 | date = July 20, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She recommends shopping at farmers' markets for fresh tomatoes, a butcher for choice bacon, and a bakery for fresh bread.&lt;ref name="classic" /&gt; The author recommends mayonnaise brands [[Hellmann's]] and [[Best Foods]],&lt;ref name="classic" /&gt; and Niman bacon from California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Schamberg | first =Anne | title =Bring on the bacon&amp;nbsp;— Those sizzlin' strips of bacon are back in a big way| work = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | location =[[Wisconsin]]  | publisher = Journal Sentinel Inc. | page = 01 | date = July 20, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan writes, "For lettuce, remove the first outer leaf and then use only the next three layers. Further in, iceberg lettuce gets a little cabbagey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Heller  | first = Ann  | coauthors =  | title =Tasty BLT&amp;nbsp;— It's all in the order of placement| work =[[Dayton Daily News]]  | location = [[Ohio]] | publisher =  Cox Ohio Publishing| page = E4 | date = July 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The BLT Cookbook'' begins with a recipe for a mini-cocktail selection of the BLT, followed by a larger version that the author recommends for large gatherings such as picnics.&lt;ref name="saekel" /&gt; Non-traditional presentations of the BLT combination include "Tomatoes Stuffed with Bacon Risotto", "Potato Soup with Tomatoes and Bacon" and "Tomato Bread Pudding".&lt;ref name="okun" /&gt; The author presents varieties of the BLT that omit one ingredient.&lt;ref name="okun" /&gt; "The Fisherman's BLT"{{mdash}}which uses seafood{{mdash}}is an alternative to the standard sandwich and the "ZLT" comprises zucchini, lettuce and tomato.&lt;ref name="enna"&gt;{{cite news| last =  Enna| first = Renee | title =  BLTs&amp;nbsp;– and the red diva| work =[[Chicago Tribune]]  | language =  | publisher =  | page =  6| date = July 2, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan was inspired by a salmon sandwich she bought at Pike Place Market in Seattle to create a BLT sandwich with salmon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =  Peterson| first = Diane | title = Tomato tribune&amp;nbsp;— Wine country chefs pay homage to a vegetable once misunderstood, now a worldwide staple | work =  [[The Press Democrat]]| location = [[Santa Rosa, California]] | page = D1 | date =August 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Bacon, Leek and Tomato Strudel" is a dish that does not use bread.&lt;ref name="okun" /&gt; All recipes presented in ''The BLT Cookbook'' include tomatoes.&lt;ref name="okun" /&gt; Towards the end of the book, recipes for bread pudding, strudel and tomato pie are included.&lt;ref name="saekel" /&gt; Selected wines that Jordan recommends to accompany her dishes include a Rhone-style red, [[beaujolais]], or [[pinot noir]].&lt;ref name="pankey" /&gt;

==Background==
Food writer Michele Anna Jordan has contributed columns published in the food and wine section of ''[[The Press Democrat]]''.&lt;ref name="peyton" /&gt; and restaurant reviews for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref name="saekel"&gt;{{cite news| last = Saekel | first = Karola | title =What's new&amp;nbsp;— Cook's books&amp;nbsp;— Don't hold the mayo  | work =  [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | publisher = The Chronicle Publishing Co. | page = E2 | date = July 16, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The BLT Cookbook'' is Jordan's 14th book.&lt;ref name="peyton"&gt;{{cite news| last = Peyton | first =Sara | title =Rafting and writing: Poet presents a unique workshop | work =[[The Press Democrat]]  | location =[[Santa Rosa, California]]  | page = G5 | date = June 8, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She decided to write about the BLT sandwich after discovering it was a good remedy for [[morning sickness]],&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite news| last =The Cincinnati Post staff | title = Post scripts&amp;nbsp;— Tomato source  | work =  [[The Cincinnati Post]]| location =[[Ohio]]  | page =B1  | date = August 6, 2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that others who frequented a food website shared her love of the BLT.&lt;ref name="post" /&gt; Jordan spent ten years researching for the book, and spent a winter writing it.&lt;ref name="thym" /&gt; During her research, Jordan taste-tested hundreds of variations on the BLT sandwich.&lt;ref name="thym" /&gt; In 2003 the author hosted two radio programs on [[KRCB-FM]], "Mouthful with Michele Anna Jordan" and "Red Shoes Rodeo".&lt;ref name="newmouthful"&gt;{{cite news| last = The Press Democrat staff  | title =  | work =[[The Press Democrat]]   | location = [[Santa Rosa, California]]  | page = D10 | date =October 1, 2003 }}{{incomplete citation|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Jordan  | first = Michele Anna | title = Plums, apples, veggies abound at Gualala Farmers Market | work = [[The Press Democrat]] | location = [[Santa Rosa, California]]| page = D1 | date = September 24, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The year the book was published, Jordan crafted a {{convert|1248|sqft|m2|adj=on}} BLT sandwich at the Kendall-Jackson Tomato Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Smith  | first =  Chris | title =There's a beef over that 146-foot BLT  | work =  [[The Press Democrat]]| location = [[Santa Rosa, California]] | page = B1 | date = September 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The BLT Cookbook'' is "highly recommended" by the [[National Pork Board]].&lt;ref name="lawson" /&gt; Kate Lawson of ''[[The Detroit News]]'' wrote that the book offers "mouthwatering recipes ranging from variations on the classic sandwich to soups, salads and pastas."&lt;ref name="lawson"&gt;{{cite news| last =Lawson  | first = Kate | title = Bacon's back in favor&amp;nbsp;— Low-carb diets, adventurous cooks have more people living high on the hog | work = [[The Detroit News]] | location =[[Michigan]]  | page =  12D| date =July 10, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karola Saekel of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote, "Recipes for recommended basics like aioli and tomato concasse round out the neat little book."&lt;ref name="saekel" /&gt; Food editor of the ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]''  Deborah Pankey wrote in her review of the book, "While giving the titled trio its due respect, author Michele Anna Jordan introduces a host of other ingredients that will surely shake up your next toasted meal (yes, she favors toast to help maintain the sandwich's structure.)"&lt;ref name="pankey"&gt;{{cite news| last = Pankey | first = Deborah | title = Jazzing the BLT up into more than a simple sandwich | work = [[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] | location =[[Arlington Heights, Illinois]]  | page = 4, Section: Food | date = July 16, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Cincinnati Post]]'' said, "[Jordan's] book presents practically all the possibilities for BLT combinations as she leaves the two slices of white toast far behind".&lt;ref name="post" /&gt; Staff writer for ''[[ANG Newspapers]]'' Jolene Thym wrote, "Not simply a cookbook, the little handbook is a discourse on the sandwich that is elegant enough to coax even the most virtuous eaters to gobble pork fat and mayonnaise with abandon."&lt;ref name="thym"&gt;{{cite news| last =  Thym ([[ANG Newspapers]])| first = Jolene | title =Love letter to the BLT  | work = [[Tri-Valley Herald]] | location = [[Pleasanton, California]] | publisher = Media NewsGroup, Inc. | page = Section: Bay Area Living | date = September 10, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; T.C.

'''''The Nuttall Encyclopædia: Being a Concise and Comprehensive Dictionary of General Knowledge'''''&lt;ref name="pg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12342|title=The Nuttall Encyclopædia|accessdate=2007-11-14|date=May 1, 2004|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a late 19th-century encyclopedia, edited by Rev. [[James Wood (encyclopedist)|James Wood]], first published in [[London]] in 1900 by [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] Ltd.

==Description==
''The Nuttall Encyclopædia'' is named for Dr. [[Peter Austin Nuttall]] (d. 1869), whose works, such as ''Standard Pronouncing Dictionary of the English Language'' (published in 1863), were eventually acquired by [[Frederick Warne]], and would be published for decades to come.

The title page proclaims this encyclopedia to be "a concise and comprehensive dictionary of general knowledge consisting of over 16,000 terse and original articles on nearly all subjects discussed in larger encyclopædias, and specially dealing with such as come under the categories of [[history]], [[biography]], [[geography]], [[literature]], [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[science]], and [[art]]".

The entries or articles in this work are generally very short, and are mostly about individuals and places; while it has entries for fictional characters from [[Charles Dickens]]' books, the encyclopedia lacks entries for [[fruit]]. It often reflects the personal [[worldview]] of the author, viewing events from a definite perspective. This can be seen in entries like [[Dates of Epoch-Making Events]]. As another example, the entry for [[Venezuela]] presents a British view of an [[Venezuela Boundary Dispute|1899 event]]:

{{quotation|...the boundary line between the [[British Guiana|British colony]] and Venezuela was for long matter of keen dispute, but by the intervention of the United States at the request of the latter a treaty between the contending parties was concluded, referring the matter to a court of arbitration, which met at Paris in 1895, and settled it in 1899, in vindication, happily, of the British claim, the [[Schomburgk Line|Schomburgk line]] being now declared to be the true line, and the gold-fields ours.}}

In 2004, [[Project Gutenberg]] published a version of the 1907 edition, which is now in the [[public domain]].

'''Video Data Bank (VDB)''' is an international [[video art]] distribution organization and resource in the United States for videos by and about contemporary artists. Located in Chicago, Illinois, VDB was founded at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1976 at the inception of the media arts movement.

VDB provides experimental video art, documentaries made by artists, and interviews with visual artists and critics for a wide range of audiences.  These include [[Microcinema|microcinemas,]] moving image festivals, media arts centers, universities, libraries, museums, community-based workshops, public television, and [[cable TV]] [[Public-access television]] centers. Video Data Bank currently holds over 6,000 titles in distribution, by more than 600 artists, available in a variety of screening and archival video formats.  It also actively publishes anthologies and curated programs of video art.

The preservation of historic video is an ongoing project of the Video Data Bank. The total holdings, including works both in and out of distribution, include over 10,000 titles of original and in some cases, rarely seen, video art and documentaries from the late 1960s on. The VDB functions as a Department of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and is supported in part by awards from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[Illinois Arts Council]].

== History ==

In 1974, VDB co-founders [[Kate Horsfield]] and [[Lyn Blumenthal]], graduate students at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, began conducting video interviews with women artists who they felt were underrepresented critically in the art world. After buying a Panasonic [[Portapak]] and successfully conducting talks with painters [[Joan Mitchell]] and [[Agnes Martin]] and curator [[Marcia Tucker]], the pair decided to continue the series.  "It was really a kind of accident,” noted Horsfield in a 2007 interview. “We were looking for inspiration for ourselves, but we were also looking for information on what was happening. If you read art magazines in the early '70s, it was very rare to see any real coverage of any women artists."  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/film/before-youtube-6426166&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 Horsfield and Blumenthal officially founded the Video Data Bank, taking over a small collection of student video productions and interviews that was begun by [[Phil Morton]] at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. They went on to add to the archive, conducting talks with prominent artists of the period such as [[Alice Neel]], [[Lucy Lippard]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Barbara Kruger]], and the [[Guerrilla Girls]], who appeared wearing their trademark gorilla masks.

Lyn Blumenthal died in 1988, and the VDB maintains the Lyn Blumenthal Memorial Scholarship.  Horsfield remained director of the collection until her retirement in 2006, when she was succeeded by Abina Manning.  In 2007 the National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture (NAMAC) presented Video Data Bank with its Outstanding Media Arts Organization Award.

== Collection ==

The Video Data Bank collection includes video produced from 1968 to the present.  The early video art represented includes many titles from the Castelli-Sonnabend collection, the first and most prominent collection of video art assembled in the United States, produced between 1968 and 1980. These works represent examples of the first experiments in video art and include conceptual and feminist performances recorded on video, experiments with the video signal, and 'guerilla' documentaries representing a counter-cultural view of the historical events of the 1960s. Artists included are [[Vito Acconci]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Dara Birnbaum]], [[Joan Jonas]], [[Bruce Nauman]] and [[William Wegman (photographer)|William Wegman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vdb.org/titles/surveying-first-decade-volume-2|title=Surveying the First Decade: Volume 2|work=vdb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection includes the work of contemporary artists who largely address post-modern themes such as feminism, AIDS, gender studies, guerilla television, technology, and identity, among them [[Sadie Benning]], [[Jem Cohen]], [[Harun Farocki]], [[Walid Raad]], Paul Chan, [[Guillermo Gómez-Peña]], [[Miranda July]], and [[George Kuchar]].

The On Art and Artists collection includes interviews with visual artists, photographers and critics. The interviews focus on the development of the artists' body of work.

In addition, Video Data Bank represents two important video archives: the Kuchar Archive, encompassing the extensive video output of twin brothers George and Mike Kuchar, and the Videofreex Archive, which chronicles the counter-cultural movement of the 1960s and 1970s as documented by the 10-person collective.

== ''Surveying the First Decade'' ==
''Surveying the First Decade: Video Art and Alternative Media in the U.S.'' is a 17-hour compilation of experimental and independent video created from 1968-1980, the first decade of video art production produced in 1995. The anthology includes 68 titles by more than 60 artists, and is curated into eight programs ranging from conceptual, performance-based, feminist, and image-processed works, to documentary and grassroots activism.

Chris Hill, former video curator at [[Hallwalls|Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center]] in Buffalo, New York, curated the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vdb.org/titles/surveying-first-decade-volume-1|title=Surveying the First Decade: Volume 1|work=vdb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter Drowley Filmer''' (1 September 1865 – 24 August 1944) was an early pioneer of [[X-rays]] in Australia, a wireless engineer, for a time ran the [[British Royal Train]], and a world class entomologist that discovered several new species in his homeland. Filmer was a naturalist and established a private collection at his residence that thousands of people visited.

==Life and Times==
In 1865, Filmer was born in [[Maitland, New South Wales]], Australia. He was the son of William Filmer (1828-1902) and Amy Filmer née Hatton (1831-1901).&lt;ref&gt;Australia Births and Baptisms, 1792-1981. Database. FamilySearch. Filmer. Citing Maitland, Australia; FHL microfilm 991,451.&lt;/ref&gt; He married Mary Anne E. née Chessell (1868-1951) in 1890 in [[Sydney]]. The couple had 4 children: son, Walter Harold Alexandra Filmer (1892-1964), born on 10 February 1892 in Sydney; daughter, Mary Filmer (1895-1895), born in 1895 in [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]]; son, Leroy Drowley Filmer (1902-1976), born on 5 April 1902 in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]; and son, Eric Filmer (1903-1986), born 10 December 1903 in [[Toronto, New South Wales|Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;Editor (16 February 2011).

Database. FamilySearch. Walter Drowley Filmer, 1944. Citing reference 303; FHL microfilm 991,451.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, at the age of 11, he was apprenticed to a boot maker. In 1884, by the age of 19, Filmer became an assistant telegraph line repairer and operator with the New South Wales Post Office. From 1885 to 1912, he was appointed to the [[New South Wales Government Railways]] as [[Telegraphy|telegraph officer]]. In 1890, Filmer was selected to go to England as a cadet to study railway electrical science and safety. In England he lived with an uncle at the [[Tower of London]]. At one point he found himself in charge of the [[British Royal Train]] that ran from [[London]] to [[Edinburgh]]. After completion of railway studies in England in 1891, Filmer returned to New South Wales. With newly acquired knowledge and skills, he received appointment as Electrical Inspector for Railways and remained in that capacity until retirement in 1908.&lt;ref name=Owen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Filmer, Walter Drowley.

In 1909, Filmer was appointed head [[Teacher|instructor]] of [[electricity]] for [[Mining|mines]] at [[Hunter Institute of TAFE|Newcastle Technical College]], [[Hunter Institute of TAFE|Maitland Technical College]] and [[Hunter Institute of TAFE|Cessnock Technical College]] and taught Applied Electricity. These schools were all mining technical colleges. From 1909 to 1931, he was physics master at Newcastle Technical College, and retired in 1931.&lt;ref name=Owen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Filmer, W.D. (1920).

==Wireless and X-Rays==
Filmer received an appointment as [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless engineer]] to the [[Douglas Mawson]] [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition|Expedition]] to the [[South Pole]], but was unable to accept since the Railway Department would not grant him a release to participate. 
Filmer and his brother Bert Filmer operated one of the first [[X-ray]] installation in Australia, three days after cables were received in Australia that announced the discovery of X-rays. From 1896 to 1910, the Filmer brothers were appointed Honorary Electricians at [[Newcastle Hospital]] and were X-rays operators at Newcastle Hospital.&lt;ref name=Owen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Home/&gt;&lt;ref name=Trove/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartley/&gt;

==Entomologist==
Filmer was interested in studies that involved [[entomology]] and [[marine life]]. He researched parasites, a noteworthy achievement was the discovery of a new [[Family (Biology)|family]]: ‘’[[Cestoda|Cestoda genera]]’’, that became known as ''Filmeric''.  He had an extensive collection of insects, comprising several thousand samples, and perhaps one of the leading private collections at the time. Filmer developed a keen interest in field work that involved spiders and teamed with Dr. [[Jiří Baum]] of the [[National Museum (Prague)|Prague Museum]], the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[zoologist]] and a leading world authority on [[spiders]].&lt;ref name=Owen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Trove/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baum, Jiří. (1938). On the habits of the Australian spider Dinopis subrufus L. Koch. Mem Soc Vestnik Ceskoslovenske Zoologicke Spolecnosti Prague. (5): 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Filmer performed research with Dr. [[Robert John Tillyard|Robin Tillyard]] on [[fossil]] insects.&lt;ref&gt;Tillyard, Robin John. (1917). Mesozoic and tertiary Insects of Queensland. Plannipenia, Trichoptera and the new order Protomecoptera. In Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. 42(1): 175-200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tillyard, R. J. (1926). Upper Permian insects of New South Wales.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tillyard, Robin John. (1926). The Insects of Australia and New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; He also teamed with John Mitchell, of Newcastle, on fossil [[trilobites]], and was honored with a species being named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, John. (1918). The Carboniferous trilobites of Australia. In Proc. Linn. Soc. NSW. 43(3): 437-494.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, J. (1919). On two new trilobites from Bowning. In Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. (44): 441-449.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, John. (1919). Some additional trilobites from New South Wales. Proceedings of the [[Linnean Society of New South Wales]]. 44: 850-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Filmer collected 3 [[cestodes]] at [[Tuggerah]] from a fresh water [[tortoise]], ''[[Chelodina longicollis]]'', and submitted these to the [[South Australian Museum]] for identification. [[Thomas Harvey Johnston]] reported that this was the first known occurrence for an ''[[Amphilinidea|Amphilinid]]'' to be collected in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and  the only known instance of a member of the order in a [[reptile]], the other known species described, one example from [[sturgeons]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], two from a primitive fresh-water fish from northern [[South America]], and one from a marine fish off the coast of [[Ceylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, T. Harvey. (1931). An amphilinid cestode from an Australian tortoise. Austral. J. Exp. Biol. Med. Sc. Adelaide. 8: 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, T. Harvey. (1934). Remarks on some Australian Cestodaria. Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. 59(1-2): 66-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
As previously mentioned, Filmer is credited in the [[animalia]] and [[insecta]] world with species named in his honor for significant contributions.

Australia is one of the few countries to recognize a group of people for a major achievement where the group happened to work independently in different locations in Australia. These significant achievements by 3 individuals are disputed even to this day. Not the historical fact that the events occurred, but the claim of who accomplished what first, and who should receive credit for being the first in Australia to perform [[medical radiography]]. [[Australia Post]] decided a fair way was to depict all three individuals on a [[postage stamp]], issued to coincided and commemorate the 100th anniversary of [[Wilhelm Röntgen]]’s discovery of [[X-rays]]. On 7 September 1995, Father [[Joseph Patrick Slattery]], [[Thomas Ranken Lyle|Thomas Lyle]], and Walter Drowley Filmer were recognized as the pioneers of X-ray technology in Australia.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Tony.

[[File:I samma ögonblick var hon förvandlad till en underskön liten älva.jpg|thumb|A [[fairy]] offering wishes, illustration by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]] to Alfred Smedberg's ''The seven wishes'']]

A '''wish''' is a [[hope]] or [[desire]] for something. Fictionally, wishes can be used as [[plot device]]s. In folklore, opportunities for "making a wish" or for wishes to "come true" or "be granted" are themes that are sometimes used.

==In fiction== 

In [[fiction]] a wish is a [[supernatural]] demand placed on the recipient's unlimited request. When it is the center of a tale, the wish is usually a template for a [[morality tale]], "be careful what you wish for"; it can also be a small part of a tale, in which case it is often used as a [[plot device]]. One can wish on many things for example: wishing wells, dandelions when one blows the seeds or light them on fire, stars and much more. When one wishes in a well he or she throws money in, in the hope his or her wish comes true, the money normally goes to a charity. 

A template for fictional wishes could be ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'', specifically the tale of [[Aladdin]], although in the tale of Aladdin the actual wishes were only part of the tale.  Also, Aladdin's demands, while outrageous, were mainly variations on wealth (which is still often taken as the most common request).

Classically the wish provider is often a spirit, [[genie]], or similar entity, which is bound or constrained within a commonplace object (Aladdin's [[oil lamp]] for example) or a container closed with [[Solomon]]'s seal. Releasing the entity from its constraint, usually by some simple action, allows the object's possessor to make a wish.

The subservience of the extraordinarily powerful entity to the wisher can be explained in several ways. The entity may be grateful to be free of its constraint and the wish is a thank-you gift. The entity may be bound to obedience by its prison or some other item that the wisher possesses. The entity may, by its nature, be unable to exercise its powers without an initiator.

Other wish providers are a wide variety of, more or less, inanimate objects. W.W. Jacob's [[The Monkey's Paw|Monkey's Paw]] is an  example of this. [[Piers Anthony]] puts a spin on this idea in ''[[Castle Roogna]]'': a magic ring claims to grant wishes and then claims credit when a wish comes true, apparently from 
the unaided efforts of the characters—but every wish made on the ring sooner or later comes true.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of 
Fantasy'', "Rings", p. 813 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some wishes appear to be granted by nothing in particular. [[Snow White]]'s mother's wish for a beautiful child might have been a coincidence,&lt;ref&gt;Maria 
Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p. 243 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the father's wish in "[[The Seven Ravens]]" [[Shapeshifting#Ill-advised wishes|transforms]] his seven sons into ravens,&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p. 136 W. W. Norton 
&amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; just as the mother's wish in "[[The Raven (Brothers Grimm)|The Raven]]" transforms her daughter. This is common in a tale involving a person, male or female, wishing for a child, even one that is [[Hans My Hedgehog|a hedgehog]], or [[The Myrtle|a sprig of myrtle]], or no bigger than [[The Hazel-nut Child|a hazel nut]].

The number of wishes granted varies. Aladdin had an unlimited number in the original story, but was restricted to three wishes in the [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|1992 Disney film]]. As in the [[Charles Perrault]] tale "[[The Ridiculous Wishes]]", three is the most 
common,&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p. 166  W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but 
others may be granted to fit the constraints of the tale. Several authors have spun variations of the wish for more wishes theme, though some disallow this as 
cheating.

In many stories the ''wording'' of the wish is extremely important. For example, characters often say, "I wish I was wealthy." This wording could be taken 
literally, the wish granted so that at one time the wisher was (used to be) wealthy but is not any more. Saying, "I wish to be wealthy", then because "to be" 
refers to either the present or the future, they would become wealthy.

A common problem is the granter of the wish being either [[quibble (plot device)|extremely literal]] or through malice granting the request in a manner designed to cause maximum distress (such as a request for wealth being granted through inheritance/insurance on the death of a loved one). Certain authors have also tried an "always on" approach: the careless use of the word "wish" in everyday conversation having, often unpleasant, consequences.

==In practice==
Some cultures have customs in which people are encouraged to "make a wish", such as blowing out the candles on a [[birthday cake]], seeing a 
[[meteoroid|shooting star]] at night, tossing a coin into a [[wishing well]] or [[fountain]] or breaking the [[Furcula|wishbone]] of a cooked [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]. Many believe such wishes can only come true if they are kept a secret from other people. Others, on the other hand, believe that wishes come true only if they are told to someone else.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
