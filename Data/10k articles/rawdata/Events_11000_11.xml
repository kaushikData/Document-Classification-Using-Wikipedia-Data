{{Campaignbox Korean Cold War}}
On April 15, 1969,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;[[DPRK]] supreme leader [[Kim Il-sung]]'s 57th [[Birthday of Kim Il-sung|birthday]]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[United States Navy]] [[Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star]] of Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron One ([[VQ-1]]) on a [[reconnaissance]] mission was shot down by a [[North Korea]]n [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] aircraft over the [[Sea of Japan]]. The plane crashed {{convert|90|nmi|km|0}} off the North Korean coast and all 31&amp;nbsp;Americans (30 sailors and 1 Marine) on board were killed, which constitutes the largest single loss of U.S. aircrew during the [[Cold War]] era.&lt;ref name="CW"&gt;{{cite book | last =Larson | first =George A. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2001| url = | title = Cold war shoot downs: Part two| work = Air Classics | publisher = Challenge Publications Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plane was an adaptation of a Lockheed Super Constellation and was fitted with a fuselage radar, so the primary tasks were to act as a long range patrol, conduct electronic surveillance, and act as a warning device.&lt;ref name="CW" /&gt;

The [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration did not retaliate against North Korea apart from staging a naval demonstration in the [[Sea of Japan]] a few days later, which was quickly removed. It resumed the reconnaissance flights within a week to demonstrate that it would not be intimidated by the action while at the same time avoiding a confrontation.&lt;ref name="pearson"&gt;{{cite book | last =Pearson | first =David E. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =2001 | chapter-url = http://aupress.maxwell.af.mil/digital/pdf/book/b_0076_pearson_command_control_system.pdf| chapter = Chapter 5 - Three WWMCCS Failures| format = | title =The World Wide Military Command and Control System: Evolution and Effectiveness| ISBN=1-58566-078-7 | publisher = Air University Press| accessdate = 14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight of Deep Sea 129==

===Beggar Shadow Mission===
The code name "Beggar Shadow" was used to describe the late-1960s Cold War reconnaissance program by the United States Navy that collected intelligence about and communications between Soviet Bloc nations while remaining safely (at least according to international laws) in international waters.

At 07:00 local time of Tuesday, 15 April 1969, an EC-121M of the U.S. Navy's Fleet Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron One ([[VQ-1]]) took off from [[NAS Atsugi]], Japan, on an intelligence-gathering reconnaissance mission.&lt;ref name="ds129"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =| url =http://www.willyvictor.com/History/Korean_Shootdown/Korea.html| title =Korea shootdown of Navy EC-121 in 1969| work =| publisher =Willy Victor| accessdate =21 May 2007| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110718052949/http://www.willyvictor.com/History/Korean_Shootdown/Korea.html| archive-date =2011-07-18| dead-url =yes| df =}} This site compiles information from ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Pacific Stars and Stripes]]'', ''[[Washington Post]]'' articles, and ''Cryptolog'', a veteran's association newsletter.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft, Bureau number 135749, c/n 4316,&lt;ref&gt;Marson, Peter J., compiler and editor, "Airlines &amp; Airliners No. 9 – Super Constellation", Airline Publications &amp; Sales Ltd., Noble Corner, Great West Road, Hounslow, Middx., UK, November 1973, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; bore the tail code "PR-21" and used the radio call sign ''Deep Sea 129''. Aboard were 8 officers and 23 enlisted men under the command of [[Lieutenant commander|LCDR]] James Overstreet. Nine of the crew, including one [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]], were Naval Security Group [[cryptologic technician]]s (CTs) and linguists in Russian and Korean.&lt;ref name="pearson"/&gt;

Deep Sea 129's assigned task was a routine ''Beggar Shadow'' signal intelligence ([[SIGINT]]) collection mission.&lt;ref name="mig21"&gt;{{cite book | last =Bermudez | first =Joseph S., Jr. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year =2005 | chapter-url = http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/BytesAndBullets/CH13.pdf| chapter = Chapter 13 - SIGINT, EW and EIW in the Korean People's Army, an Overview| format = | title =Bytes and Bullets: The Information Technology Revolution and National Security on the Korean peninsula  |editor-first=Alexandre Y. |editor-last=Mansourov| publisher = APCSS| ISBN=0-9719416-9-6|accessdate = 23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its flight profile involved taking off from NAS Atsugi then flying northwest over the [[Sea of Japan|Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea)]] until it came to an area off [[Kilchu|Musu Point]], where the EC-121M would turn northeast toward the [[Soviet Union]] and orbit along a {{convert|120|nmi|km|0|sing=on}} long elliptical track similar to that of a racetrack; once the mission was complete, they were to return to [[Osan Air Base]], South Korea.&lt;ref name="ecdown"&gt;{{cite web | last =Mobley | first = Richard A. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2001 | url =http://search.proquest.com/docview/206000152?accountid=14749| title = EC-121 down! |format = | work =  | publisher = United States Naval Institute | accessdate = 23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LCDR Overstreet's orders included a prohibition from approaching closer than {{convert|50|nmi|km|-1}} to the North Korean coast. VQ-1 had flown the route and orbit for two years, and the mission had been graded as being of "minimal risk." During the first three months of 1969 nearly 200 similar missions had been flown by both Navy and U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft off North Korea's east coast without incident.&lt;ref name="pearson"/&gt;

These missions, while nominally under the command of [[Seventh Fleet]] and [[CINCPAC]], were controlled operationally by the Naval Security Group detachment at [[Naval Support Facility Kamiseya|NSF Kamiseya]], Japan, under the direction of the [[National Security Agency]].&lt;ref name="pearson"/&gt;

The mission was tracked by a series of security agencies within the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] that were pre-briefed on the mission, including land-based Air Force radars in South Korea and Japan. The USAF 6918th Security Squadron at [[Fukuoka Airport|Hakata Air Station]], [[Japan]], USAF 6988th Security Squadron at [[Yokota Air Base]], [[Japan]], and Detachment 1, 6922nd Security Wing at Osan Air Base monitored the North Korean reaction by intercepting its air defense search radar transmissions. The [[Army Security Agency]] communications interception station at Osan listened to North Korean air defense radio traffic, and the Naval Security Group at Kamiseya, which provided seven of the nine CTs aboard ''Deep Sea 129'', also intercepted [[Soviet Air Force]] search radars.&lt;ref name="pearson"/&gt;

===Interception and shoot-down===
Very soon after arrival over the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea), at 10:35., North Korea reacted to the presence of the EC-121, but not in a way that would jeopardize the mission.&lt;ref name="ecdown"/&gt; At 12:34 local time, roughly six hours into the mission, the Army Security Agency and radars in Korea detected the takeoff of two [[North Korean Air Force]] [[MiG-21]]s from East Tongchong-ni&lt;ref name="dorr"&gt;{{cite web | last =Dorr | first = Robert F. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2003 | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/909166087?accountid=14749| title = N. Korean shootdown of EC-121 killed 30 sailors, one marine |format = | work = Navy Times  | publisher = Gannett Co., Inc | accessdate = 23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Wonsan]] and tracked them, assuming that they were responding in some fashion to the mission of Deep Sea 129.&lt;ref name="mig21"/&gt; In the meantime the EC-121 filed a scheduled activity report by radio on time at 13:00 and did not indicate anything out of the ordinary, but this was the last message sent from the plane. Twenty-two minutes later the radars lost the picture of the MiGs and did not reacquire it until 13:37, where they were closing with Deep Sea 129 for a probable intercept.&lt;ref name="pearson"/&gt;

The communications that this activity generated within the National Security network was monitored by the EC-121's parent unit, VQ-1, which at 13:44 sent Deep Sea 129 a "Condition 3" alert by radio, indicating it might be under attack. LCDR Overstreet acknowledged the warning and complied with procedures to abort the mission and return to base.&lt;ref name="ds129"/&gt; Approaching from the northeastern coast at supersonic speed, the MiGs easily overtook the EC-121, who could do little with their "warning."&lt;ref name="ecdown"/&gt; The MiGs were armed with 23&amp;nbsp;mm cannons and [[K-13 (missile)|AA-2 Atoll]] missiles; the EC-121 was unarmed and without a fighter escort.&lt;ref name="dorr"/&gt; At 13:47 the radar tracks of the MiGs merged with that of Deep Sea 129, which disappeared from the radar picture two minutes later.&lt;ref name="pearson"/&gt; The MiGs had blown the EC-121 out of the sky, and while the details of the incident have never been released to the public, it is assumed that an air-to-air missile was used as the North Korean press mentioned that a "single shot" downed the aircraft.&lt;ref name="ecdown"/&gt;

==Reactions==

===Initial North Korean reaction===
Immediately following the attack, the North Korean forces assumed a state of high alert.  Their media broadcast its version of events two hours after the incident.  Referring to the EC-121 as the "plane of the insolent U.S. imperialist aggressor army,"&lt;ref name="dorr"/&gt; the North Korean media accused it of "reconnoitering after intruding deep into the territorial air."&lt;ref name="dorr"/&gt; The story cast it as "the brilliant battle success of shooting it down with a single shot by showering the fire of revenge upon it."&lt;ref name="dorr"/&gt;

===Initial United States reaction===
At first none of the agencies were alarmed, since procedures also dictated that the EC-121 rapidly descend below radar coverage, and Overstreet had not transmitted that he was under attack. When it did not reappear within ten minutes VQ-1 requested a scramble of two Air Force [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]] interceptors to provide [[combat air patrol]] for the EC-121.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.f-106deltadart.com/korea.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

By 14:20 the Army Security Agency post had become increasingly concerned. It first sent a FLASH message (a high priority intelligence message to be actioned within six minutes) indicating that ''Deep Sea 129'' had disappeared, and then at 14:44, an hour after the shoot-down, sent a CRITIC ("critical intelligence") message (the highest message priority, to be processed and sent within two minutes) to six addressees within the [[National Command Authority]], including [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]].&lt;ref name="pearson"/&gt;

Nixon regarded the attack as a total surprise and remained at a loss to explain it. The U.S. bureaucracy and the member of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] were also unable to understand the attack.&lt;ref name="ecdown"/&gt;

===Soviet reaction===
Despite being the height of the [[Cold War]], the Soviet Union quickly provided assistance in the recovery efforts.  Two Soviet destroyers were sent to the Sea of Japan, and their involvement highlighted [[Moscow]]’s disapproval of the attack on the EC-121.&lt;ref name="dorr"/&gt;

==U.S. response==
[[File:US Task Force 71 underway off Korea in April 1969.jpg|thumb|Ships of Task Force 71 underway off Korea in April 1969.]]
[[File:USS Pueblo &amp; EC-121 Incident Map border rev1.png|thumb|Defender Station]]
The US responded by activating [[Task Force 71]] (TF-71) to protect future flights over those [[international waters]]. Initially, the Task Force comprised the aircraft carriers {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|2}}, {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|2}}, {{USS|Ranger|CV-61|2}}, and {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|2}} with a screen of cruisers and destroyers that also included the battleship {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}}. The ships for TF-71 came mostly from Southeast Asia duty. This deployment became one of the largest shows of force in the area since the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bolger|first=Daniel|title=Scenes from an Unfinished War: Low intensity conflict in Korea 1966–1969|publisher=Diane Publishing Co|isbn=978-0-7881-1208-9|year=1991|page=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the attack, some, including Representative [[L. Mendel Rivers|Mendel Rivers]] responded to the attack by calling for retaliation against North Korea.&lt;ref name="dorr"/&gt;  On April 16th, the United States National Security Council considered the following options:&lt;ref name="ecdown"/&gt;
*	Show of force using naval and air forces
*	Resumption of EC-121 missions with escorts
*	"Select military combat actions" such as:
**	Destruction of a North Korean aircraft over water
**	Selected air strikes against a military target
**	Shore bombardment of military targets
**	Ground raids across the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]]
**	Attack on military targets near the Demilitarized Zone by artillery or missile fire
**	Attacks on North Korean naval vessels by U.S. submarines
**	Blockade
**	Mining/threatening to mine North Korean waters
**	Seizure of North Korean assets abroad
In addition to the NSC’s ideas, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] prepared several plans to bomb the airfield at [[Sondok Airport|Sondok]] and [[Kalma Airport|Wonsan]].  If all went according to plan, bombers would attack the airfields under cover of night.&lt;ref name="ecdown"/&gt; CINCPAC proposed the positioning of ships, with missiles capable of taking down planes, in the Sea of Japan with orders to destroy North Korean aircraft, impound other North Korean vessels venturing into international waters (fishing boats, etc.), and fire onto the shore (especially near Wonsan).&lt;ref name="ecdown"/&gt;

In the end, no action was taken against the North Koreans in the days following the attack. The new Nixon administration had little to no information about the location and availability of both U.S. and North Korean forces, as the administration had difficulty communicating with those in the Pacific. By the time this information was communicated to the planners, it was too late to react.&lt;ref name="ecdown"/&gt; Both Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger were ashamed at the outcome of the event, with Kissinger revealing that "our conduct in the EC-121 crisis as weak, indecisive and disorganized."&lt;ref name="ecdown"/&gt; Once it became clear that no action would be taken against the North Koreans, Nixon promised that "they’ll [North Koreans] never get away with it again," and ordered a "resumption of aerial reconnaissance flights."&lt;ref name="ecdown"/&gt;

==Motivation for the attack==
A few theories have arisen to explain the unprompted take down of the EC-121, but all revolve around North Korea as a rogue entity. Nixon and his administration assumed that North Korea would behave within the standards of international law. Similar to the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)#Pueblo_incident|''Pueblo'' incident]], Pyongyang took action against the EC-121 plane despite it being located well outside of North Korean territory.&lt;ref name="ecdown"/&gt;

Other sources claim that this attack may have taken place to honor [[Kim Il-sung]], as [[Birthday of Kim Il-sung|his birthday]] fell on April 15, but not enough evidence exists to support this statement.&lt;ref name="dorr"/&gt;

Some also believe that this may have been an accidental shooting,&lt;ref name="dorr"/&gt; but many disagree because of the promptness of the media coverage in North Korea as well as its story that the plane had entered far into North Korean airspace.&lt;ref name="ecdown"/&gt; In the end, not enough information is available outside of North Korea to discern the true motive.

==Historical significance==
{{See also|Korean DMZ Conflict|Blue House Raid}}
In order to fully understand this incident, North Korean foreign relations incidents from both the past and present should be considered. It was not out of the ordinary for the North Korean media to cover up incidences of North Korea breaking international law as foreign threats against national security.  These other events provide insight into understanding the actions of North Korea, as direct motives are unavailable.  Many international incidences that involve North Korea follow a similar structure, and point to the manipulative nature of the Kim regime in dealing with foreign nations; as well as the weak responses by U.S. forces.

===Pueblo incident===
{{see|Pueblo incident}}
The ''Pueblo'' Incident in 1968 marks another international incident, again involving the United States, in which North Korean ships attacked a boat surveying in international waters. A similar media approach was taken, and the North Korean populace received biased information about the incident.&lt;ref name="arm"&gt;{{cite book | last =Armstrong | first =Charles K. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2013 | url = | title = Tyranny of the Weak. North Korea and the World 1950-1992  | publisher = Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the United States and South Korean governments were outraged, and many in the populace demanded retribution for the attack. Immediately, nothing was done, and the captured crewmen were allowed to come home only after eleven months of negotiations and an embarrassing apology from the United States to North Korea.&lt;ref name="arm"/&gt;  Once the crew was returned safely to South Korea and news of their treatment reached Washington, the apology was rescinded.

The Soviet Union publicly backed North Korea being the height of the Cold War, but privately many disapproved of the decision. While relations with the other Cold War giant, China, remained the same.

===Axe murder incident===
{{see|Axe murder incident}}
In 1976, the North Koreans clashed again with the joint South Korean-United States forces in what is known as the [[axe murder incident]]. Southern forces were pruning a tree near the DMZ. The North Korean guards responded to the trimming with surprising hostility, sparking a violent brawl that culminated with the murder of two American soldiers, both of whom had been axed to death.&lt;ref name="arm"/&gt; Historically similar to this incident and the Pueblo incident, the North Korean retelling of events paints the United States and South Korean forces as the aggressors, and this incident almost led to a second Korean War.&lt;ref name="arm"/&gt;

Unlike the other incidents, however, in the end, the North Korean government apologized to the South Korean and American governments for the event, but relations between the three nations remained strained.&lt;ref name="arm"/&gt;

The '''1998 Auckland power crisis''' was a five-week-long [[power outage]] affecting the central city of [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] in February and March ([[Southern Hemisphere|southern]] summer) of 1998.

At the time, almost all of downtown Auckland was supplied with electricity by [[Mercury Energy|Mercury Energy Limited]] via four 110&amp;nbsp;kV [[power cable]]s from the national grid at [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]]'s Penrose substation, with two cables each connecting to two central city substations at Liverpool Street and Quay Street. The two cables connecting to Quay Street were 40-year-old gas-insulated cables that were past their replacement date. One of the Quay Street cables failed on 20 January, possibly due to the unusually hot and dry conditions, although this did not warrant a crisis as the three remaining cables could still supply the central city. The second Quay street cable failed on 9 February, leaving only the Liverpool Street cables supplying the city. Due to the increased load from the failure of the first cables, these remaining two cables failed on 19 and 20 February, leaving the entire central city supplied by a single 22&amp;nbsp;kV cable from [[Kingsland, New Zealand|Kingsland]], resulting in about 20 city blocks (except parts of a few streets) losing all power.

[[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]] was almost deserted for the first few days, as few businesses could operate. Some brought goods out onto the street to sell, but heavy rain in the first week made that impractical. Generators were brought in from around the country to power essential services and some businesses. These made Queen Street a very noisy place and thus deterred customers. Some businesses estimated that the outage cost them at least NZ$60,000 per week.

In the five weeks it took to restore the power supply, about 60,000 of the 74,000 people who worked in the area worked from home or from relocated offices in the suburbs. Some businesses relocated staff to other New Zealand cities, or even to Australia.  The majority of the 6,000 apartment dwellers in the area had to find alternative accommodation. Temporary power was supplied to the Port of Auckland by the [[Union Rotorua]], a gas turbine powered cargo ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Auckland Unplugged: Coping with Critical Infrastructure Failure|url = https://books.google.co.nz/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=hl9r0DwzPN4C&amp;q=Union+Rotorua#v=snippet&amp;q=Union%20Rotorua&amp;f=false|publisher = Lexington Books|date = 1 January 2003|isbn = 9780739107744|language = en|first = Eric|last = Stern|first2 = Lindy|last2 = Newlove|first3 = Lina|last3 = Svedin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old gas cables were found to be repairable and were put back into service, but were restricted to 30&amp;nbsp;MVA capacity. The newer oil cables were irreparable, so to restore full supply to the city, a temporary 110&amp;nbsp;kV overhead line was constructed along the rail corridor between Penrose and Liverpool Street. 

Energy Minister Max Bradford commissioned an independent report into the Auckland Power Supply Failure.  The report of the Ministerial Inquiry was released on 21 July 1998. &lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/energy/news/article.cfm?c_id=37&amp;objectid=3400502 |title= Ministerial Inquiry into the Auckland Power Supply Failure|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald|NZ Herald]]|date= 21 July 1998|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the crisis Mercury Energy Limited disposed of its electricity and gas retail business and, renamed [[Vector Limited]], replaced the cables and reinforced the supply into Auckland. In 2001, a 9&amp;nbsp;km tunnel from Penrose to Hobson Street via Liverpool Street was completed, containing two new 110&amp;nbsp;kV cables to replace the damaged Liverpool Street cables and the temporary overhead line. A third 110&amp;nbsp;kV cable was installed from Mount Roskill to Quay Street via Liverpool Street, largely superseding the old gas cables which were eventually decommissioned.

The '''Abbotsford International Airshow''' is held annually on the second Friday, Saturday and Sunday in August at [[Abbotsford International Airport]] in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia]], [[Canada]].

It is Canada's largest airshow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abbotsfordairshow.com/index.php?p=1_10_SHOW-HISTORY |title=Abbotsford Airshow: Show History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907071456/http://www.abbotsfordairshow.com/index.php?p=1_10_SHOW-HISTORY |archivedate=2011-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s, Abbotsford was designated as Canada's National Airshow by Prime Minister [[Pierre E. Trudeau]]. It features both military and civilian aircraft from Canada and the United States, and on occasion military aircraft from other countries such as Britain, Germany (2000), and Russia.

==History==
[[Image:Soviet MiG-29 DF-ST-99-04977.JPG|thumb|right|MiG-29 fighter parked on the ramp after a demonstration flight at the Abbotsford Air Show, 1989.]]
The airshow was started in 1962 by the Abbotsford Flying Club.

The show experienced continuous growth through the 1960s and 70s.

The 1986 show was conducted in conjunction with [[Expo 86]], the Vancouver world's fair. This saw the inclusion of several European teams like the [[Patrouille de France]] and the [[Frecce Tricolori]] to the traditional participants ... as well as the Soviet-Ukrainian [[Antonov]] [[Antonov An-124 Ruslan|AN-124]].

In 1989, the show set a three-day attendance record of 321,000 people. The [[Soviet Union|USSR]] was represented by a large number of aircraft at [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]]. Making their North American debuts were two [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29 Fulcrum]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (a single and two-seater), an [[Sukhoi Su-26|Su-26M]] aerobatic plane, a [[Kamov Ka-27|Ka-32]] helicopter and the [[Antonov An-225 Mriya|An-225 Mriya]], the world's largest aircraft. The [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]] demonstration pilot at [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] was [[Anatoly Kvochur]], who had ejected out of a [[Mikoyan MiG-29|Mig-29]] at Le Bourget, France just months earlier. History was made at Abbotsford on the last day of the show when Major Bob Wade, [[Canadian Armed Forces]] [[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet|CF-18 Hornet]] pilot, became the first western pilot to fly a modern fighter jet from the USSR. Major Bob Wade took the controls of the Mig-29UB two-seat aircraft with Soviet test pilot Valery Menitsky. Other highlights at the show included the first appearance at Abbotsford for the only airworthy [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] bomber in North America and the return of the USAF [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds|Thunderbirds]] for the first time since 1981.

Post [[Cold War]] defence cuts affected the attendance of military teams and aircraft throughout the 1990s. Poor financial management resulted in the annual show being canceled in 1998 and returning in 1999.

In 1994 Dan and Loretta Newall got married before the start of the show, the first wedding in the 33-year history of the show.  The "I do's" were almost inaudible due to the Harriers taking off six minutes ahead of schedule.  The wedding cake was shared with people around the wedding site.  CTV gave them five minutes of air time on the news.

In 1995, while the Abbotsford Airshow included an arms trade aspect, Project Censored Canada rated it as the 8th most censored news story of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon Fraser University News|title=All The News You Didn't Year: Project Censored's Top 10 List|url=https://www.sfu.ca/archive-sfunews/sfnews/1996/May9/top10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade expo saw delegates visit from countries such as the United States and Saudi Arabia to inspect and purchase weaponry.

Celebrating its fortieth anniversary in 2002 was a significant accomplishment; it was a milestone year while airshows across North America were threatened with cancellation due to high insurance costs after 9/11.

In 2014 it was named one of the ten best airshows in the world,&lt;ref&gt;USA Today Feb 2014 &amp; tenbest.com&lt;/ref&gt; and also held a twilight show for the first time.  In December 2014 the airshow won a prestigious Silver Pinnacle award from the International Council of Airshows.&lt;ref&gt;ICAS www.airshows.aero&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the airshow continued its successful twilight show and had the Breitling jet team from France perform its first Canadian show ever.  In addition, the airshow hosted the USAF F-22 Raptor for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Abbotsford Airshow &amp; abbynews.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 two 5th generation USAF F-35A Lightning II fighter jets made history as this would mark the first appearance of an F-35 in Canada. Although two aircraft were at the airshow only one was put on static display.

==Present==

The show is now operated by the Abbotsford International Airshow Society.

==Performers==

Currently the duo consisting of Roy Hafeli &amp; Ken Hildebrandt, more commonly known as H2A2 or Hafeli and Hildebrandt Airshow Announcers provide the Airshow announcing every year.

Roy Hafeli began announcing at Abbotsford in 1999, and is a recipient of the North West Council of Air Shows 2005 Showmanship award and the 2006 Eric Beard Memorial Spirit of Flight award.  Roy also announces at many other airshows throughout Canada and the USA as well as at other special events.

Ken Hildebrandt is the newest voice at Abbotsford. He began announcing in 2007. Having attended every Abbotsford show since 1979, he noticed that while he was certainly enthralled by the many amazing flying machines that screamed over his head each summer, he became particularly interested in the people who announced the action over the loud speakers. Thus began a thirty-year interest in airshow announcing.

==Accidents and incidents during aerial display==

* August 8, 1969 At noon a [[Boeing 747]] airliner flew the 75 miles from [[Paine Field]] in [[Everett, Washington]] to make its first public airshow appearance completing three left to right flybys including a final low level slow pass to open the first day of the three day airshow. Immediately after a Mini Mustang entered the flight line from the left for a low inverted pass. Near midfield the Mini Mustang gyrated violently and dove into the ground killing the pilot, 20-year-old flight instructor Scott Nelskog from Washington State. The determination was that the residual wake vortex from the 747 pass rolled the Mini Mustang resulting in the fatal crash.
* August 12, 1973: During a four plane formation display a [[Canadian Forces]] [[CF-101 Voodoo]] entered 'inertial roll coupling' which overstressed the aircraft leading to a mid-air disintegration into several balls of flames.  Both crew members ejected safely through the fireball.  No injuries occurred as debris landed in Washington State south of the Abbotsford Airport.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Daniel V. ''A Tradition of Excellence: Canada's Airshow Team Heritage''. Victoria, BC: High Flight Enterprises, 2002. p. 386. {{ISBN|0-9687817-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 11, 2018: At approximately 5:30 pm, after the show had finished for the day, a recently restored 1930s era [[De Havilland Dragon Rapide]] crashed while taking off. The Dragon Rapide was offering rides in the historic aircraft to those that had purchased tickets. It was carrying 4 passengers and a pilot at the time of the incident. The pilot, John Sessions, was seriously injured and required a leg amputation after being airlifted to [[Royal Columbian Hospital]]. The other passengers made it out with a varying level of injuries that ranged from mild to serious.

[[File:Houghton 57-1633 - Astley's Amphitheatre, 1808 - cropped.jpg|thumb|Astley's Amphitheatre in London circa 1808.]]
'''Astley's Amphitheatre''' was a performance venue in [[London]] opened by [[Philip Astley]] in 1773.

==History==
[[File:Fanque at Astley's.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Fanque]] at Astley's Amphitheatre, 1847|right]]
The Amphitheatre opened in 1773 with ''[[The Wallet of Time]]''. The structure was burned in 1794, then rebuilt.  With increasing prosperity and rebuilding after successive fires, it grew to become Astley's Royal Amphitheatre and this was the home of the [[circus]]. The location of the theatre was [[Westminster Bridge]] Road in [[Lambeth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/icons/playbills/3ASTLEY.HTM Astley's Royal Amphitheatre], Templeman Library, [[University of Kent]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Astley's original circus was 62&amp;nbsp;ft (~19 m) in [[diameter]], and later he settled it at 42&amp;nbsp;ft (~13 m), which has been an international standard for circuses since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/2929565.stm "The circus comes to the Circus"]. BBC News. Retrieved 13 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Astleys amphitheatre.jpg|thumb|left|The original Astley's Amphitheatre, external view in 1777. Etching by [[Charles John Smith]], after [[William Capon (artist)|William Capon]], hand-coloured.]]

[[William Batty]] (1801-1868), perhaps best known as the owner of Batty's [[Hippodrome]], acquired Astley's from [[Andrew Ducrow]] (1793-1842) in 1841, after the building sustained its third fire, causing Ducrow to suffer a mental breakdown and die in early 1842.  Batty ran Astley's until 1853, at which time William Cooke leased the building.  Cooke would run Astley's until 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=J. Griffin |url=http://www.circushistory.org/Frost/Frost5.htm |title=Frost, Thomas (1881), "Circus Life and Circus Celebrities."

The theatre continued to be popular long after Astley's death in 1814.  Its final owner was [[Lord George Sanger|"Lord" George Sanger]], who bought it for £11,000 in 1871 and ran it as "Sanger's Amphitheatre" for over 20 years. It finally closed and was demolished in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/evancoll/a/014eva000000000u01154000.html Advert for George Sanger's amphitheatre], British Library Online Gallery, 26 March 2009.

==In popular culture==
[[Jane Austen]] in her 1815 novel ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', credits a visit to Astley's for bringing about the reconciliation and engagement of Robert Martin and Harriet Smith.

[[Charles Dickens]] wrote a short story titled ''Astley's'' about the theatre, in his 1836 book, [[Sketches by Boz]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/sketchesbybozill00dickiala#page/n9/mode/2up  Sketches by Boz] at [[Internet Archive]]. Retrieved 2011-4-13.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes an evening at Astley's in chapter 39 of ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'', and the circus is also referred to in ''[[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]]'' (Book 3 chapter 7). It is also referred to in Bleak House, where Mr George attends a performance there, which Dickens describes. 

[[Pablo Fanque]], the black circus equestrian and circus owner best known from his mention in [[The Beatles]] song "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" on the album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', made his London debut at Astley's in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;"The Illustrated London News," 20 March 1847.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tracy Chevalier|Tracy Chevalier's]] 2007 novel ''Burning Bright'' is set at Astley's in 1792-93.

The '''authority of Jesus questioned''' is an episode in the life of [[Jesus]] that appears in all three [[Synoptic Gospel]]s: {{bibleverse||Matthew|21:23-27|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|11:27-33|NIV}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|20:1-8|NIV}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Luke'' by Mark Black 1996 {{ISBN|0-89900-630-2}} page 319&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Gospel of Matthew]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?" 

Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. John's baptism—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or of human origin?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021:23-27&amp;version=NIV New International Version (2011)], at ''biblegateway.com''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In all three Gospels, this episode takes place shortly after the [[Cleansing of the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;''The people's New Testament commentary'' by M. Eugene Boring, Fred B. Craddock 2004 ISBN pages 258&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition''' (known as '''Cardiff Singer of the World''' from 1983–2001 and '''BBC Singer of the World in Cardiff''' in 2003) is a competition for [[opera]] and [[Art song|art singers]] held every two years.

The competition was started by [[BBC Wales]] in 1983 to celebrate the opening of [[St David's Hall]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], home of the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]]. The creation of the competition was overseen by [[Geraint Stanley Jones]], who was the controller at [[BBC Wales]] at the time.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|first=Huw|last=Thomas |title=Geraint Stanley Jones, former head of BBC Wales and S4C, dies |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-34063756 |work=[[BBC Wales]] |date=2015-08-26 |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Auditions are held throughout the world in the autumn before the competition, with singers being selected to take part in Cardiff the following June. Each singer represents their own country. In Wales is there a competition to select the national representative. The winner of the [[Welsh Singers Competition]] represents Wales in BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welshsingerscompetition.com/|title=Welsh Singers Competition – For singers at the early stages of their career, aged 18 to 32|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition is judged by a panel of distinguished singers, musicians and music professionals. In 2003 an audience prize was also introduced for the primary competition; in 2011 it was renamed the Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize to mark the passing of the singer who was the competition's first patron.

==History==
[[File:Cardiff Singer of the World.jpg|thumb|Former logo used from 2007 to 2015.]]
[[File:Nafornita Valentina-4419 (17148024471) (cropped).jpg|thumb|2011 winner, Valentina Naforniță]]
In 1983, the first year of the competition, eighteen singers participated. The winner was Finnish soprano [[Karita Mattila]].

A [[Lieder]] Prize was introduced in 1989, as art song and opera are both important forms of singing, but very different. The 1989 competition was particularly noteworthy with Welsh [[baritone]] [[Bryn Terfel]] winning the Lieder prize and Russian baritone [[Dmitri Hvorostovsky]] taking the overall title. Both singers have gone on to enjoy extremely successful careers with international acclaim.

The "Song Prize" (formerly the "Lieder Prize") was renamed in 2001 in order to clarify that it applies to art song and folksong rather than German [[Lieder]] only. The "Song Prize" became a separate event in 2003, named as the ''BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Rosenblatt Recital Song Prize''. However, after 2009, its name was changed to ''BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Song Prize''. It is not compulsory, and the only entry requirement is that the singer is taking part in the primary competition. It is not possible to enter for the "Song Prize" only.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/cardiffsinger/sites/about/pages/rules.shtml  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618155328/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/cardiffsinger/sites/about/pages/rules.shtml |date=June 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Romanian tenor Marius Brenciu became the first singer to win both prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qn4b|title=BBC Cardiff Singer of the World|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finnish baritone [[Tommi Hakala]] won in 2003, with the Song Prize going to Irish soprano [[Ailish Tynan]]. The first "Audience Prize", voted for by the audience both in the hall and for the broadcasts, was awarded to Chilean soprano [[Angela Marambio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/18MycXptR0YkZB3513Lxwg4/2003-competitors|title=2003 - The Final, BBC Cardiff Singer of the World - 2003 competitors|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 prize was won by American soprano [[Nicole Cabell]], with English tenor [[Andrew Kennedy (tenor)|Andrew Kennedy]] winning the "Song Prize" and the "Audience Prize" being won by Korean soprano [[Ha-Joung Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/3wFhjjxsWcf3rGgjJ4QMKSh/2005-competitors|title=2005 - The Final, BBC Cardiff Singer of the World - 2005 competitors|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese singer Shen Yang (subsequently known as [[Shenyang (singer)|Shenyang]]) won the 2007 competition, The "Song Prize" was won by English soprano [[Elizabeth Watts]], while [[Jacques Imbrailo]], South African baritone, won the "Audience Prize".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/cardiffsinger/sites/2007/|title=BBC - Programmes - Page not found|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the winner was Russian soprano [[Ekaterina Scherbachenko]]. The winner of the "Song Prize" was bass Jan Martinik from the Czech Republic and Italian tenor Giordano Luca took the "Audience Prize".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/cardiffsinger/sites/2009/|title=BBC - Programmes - Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Followed a revised format and schedule, the 2011 competition had 20 singers taking part in four preliminary concerts. The 2011 winner was Moldovan soprano [[Valentina Naforniţă]], who also won the newly renamed "Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize". The "Song Prize" was won by Ukrainian baritone [[Andrei Bondarenko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/43PtfDcPM8rbg615rj5xjRN/2011-competitors|title=2011, BBC Cardiff Singer of the World - 2011 competitors - BBC Four|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 30th anniversary competition took place between 16 and 23 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4JSGf2VN0HK5WM158MNlcQ7/competitors|title=2013, BBC Cardiff Singer of the World - Competitors - BBC Radio 3|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was won by US mezzo-soprano [[Jamie Barton]], who also won the "Song Prize". The "Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize" was won by English tenor Ben Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/Q6qgdjT0NNhhJvGJ9gwlvf/england-ben-johnson|title=2013, BBC Cardiff Singer of the World - England: Ben Johnson - BBC Radio 3|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qn4b|title=BBC Cardiff Singer of the World|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many non-winning finalists have gone on to very distinguished operatic careers. Examples include Swedish dramatic soprano [[Nina Stemme]] in 1993 and Latvian mezzo-soprano [[Elina Garanca]] in 2001.

==Organisation==
The competition is organised by BBC Cymru Wales and was televised nationwide by [[BBC Two]] until 2013 and on [[BBC Four]] since 2003 ([[BBC Knowledge]] in 2001). Additionally, the competition is televised by [[BBC Two Wales]], in Welsh on [[S4C]] and broadcast over radio channels [[BBC Radio 3]], [[BBC Radio Wales]] and the [[Welsh language]] [[BBC Radio Cymru]]. All coverage can also be found on [[BBC iPlayer]]. It is supported by [[Welsh National Opera]] and the [[City and County of Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/11xGqjdDnrX5FzR2y9MZz8r/about-cardiff-singer|title=BBC Cardiff Singer of the World - About Cardiff Singer|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2003, the competition's first patron was Dame [[Joan Sutherland]], until her death in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/cardiffsinger/sites/news/pages/dame-joan-sutherland.shtml  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113175131/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/cardiffsinger/sites/news/pages/dame-joan-sutherland.shtml |date=November 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, the patron has been Dame [[Kiri Te Kanawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/walesmusic/2011/01/dame-kiri-te-kanawa-cardiff-singer-patron.shtml|title=BBC - Wales Music: Dame Kiri te Kanawa announced as new Cardiff Singer patron|first=Cardiff|last=Singer|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Operation Island Watch}}
{{Campaignbox Piracy in Somalia}}

The '''Battle off Minicoy Island''' was a [[single ship action]] in January 2011 between Indian naval forces and [[Somali pirates]], during [[Car Nicobar class fast attack craft#Operation Island Watch|Operation Island Watch]]. Pirates in the former Thai [[fishing trawler]] ''Prantalay 14'' resisted and attacked the [[Indian Navy]] warship [[Car Nicobar class fast attack craft|''Cankarso'']] and, in a long surface action off [[Minicoy|Minicoy Island]], the Indians sank the hostile ship and rescued twenty captives.&lt;ref name="marinebuzz1"&gt;[http://www.marinebuzz.com/2011/01/30/pirate-mother-ship-prantalay-sinks-off-lakshadweep-during-anti-piracy-operations-by-india/ Pirate Mother Ship Prantalay Sinks off Lakshadweep during Anti Piracy Operations by India]. Marinebuzz.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The ''Prantalay 14'' had operated as a pirate [[mothership]] in the Indian Ocean for several months before her sinking. After its capture, its Thai owners refused to pay a ransom for the return of the ship and its crew and four of its original crewmembers died of starvation while the crew was kept hostage by the pirates.&lt;ref&gt;http://safety4sea.com/five-hostages-starved-to-death-on-ship-hijacked-by-somali-pirates/&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Battle==
Early in the morning of 28 January, [[Coast Guard|Indian Coast Guard]] [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] aircraft on a routine patrol detected two [[skiff]]s and the ''Prantalay 14'' chasing the [[Bahamas|Bahamian]] [[container ship]] MV ''Verdi'' 300 miles west of the [[Lakshadweep|Lakshadweep Islands]]. The pirates in the skiffs spotted the aircraft and immediately abandoned the attack and sailed back to the ''Prantalay 14''. The aircraft reported the sighting and three Indian Navy ships were dispatched, including the 325-ton INS ''Cankarso''. A [[Car Nicobar class fast attack craft|Car Nicobar]] [[fast attack craft]] under the command of Commander Arun Bahuguna. ''Cankarso'' was armed with a 30-millimeter [[CRN 91 naval gun|CRN 91]] [[naval gun]] and two 12.7-millimeter machine guns. A few hours after receiving the Coast Guard's report ''Cankarso'' found the ''Prantalay 14'' about 100 nautical miles north of Minicoy. The ''Cankarso''{{'}}s radioman tried to contact the pirates, but was ignored, so a warning shot was fired towards the pirates, who returned fire with [[rocket propelled grenade]]s and [[AK-47]]s. An exchange of fire commenced and lasted for twelve hours before shots from the CRN 9 heavily damaged the trawler.&lt;ref name="marinebuzz1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/indian-navy-arrests-15-pirates-after-drama-on-high-seas-82572 15 pirates caught after 12-hour battle]. NDTV (31 January 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Indian Navy and Coast Guard neutralise Pirate Mother Ship Prantalay-14.pdf|thumb|left|Indian Navy press release about the operation, 29 January 2011.]]
Fuel drums that were stowed on the upper deck ignited and the ''Prantalay 14'' began to burn. At that point the survivors abandoned ship so the Indians ceased firing. Thirty-five men went into the water, of whom fifteen were pirates and twenty were Thai and [[Myanmar]] sailors on the vessel when the pirates captured it. Ten pirates were killed in the engagement, and the rest were taken to [[Mumbai]] in the ''Cankarso'' as prisoners. There are no indications that any Indian sailors were harmed. Mumbai Police have confirmed that they have registered a case against the pirates for attempt to murder and various other provisions under the [[Indian Penal Code]] and [[Foreigners Act]] after entering national waters without authorization. ''Prantalay 14'' burned for hours before sinking, during which the [[INS Kalpeni|INS ''Kalpeni'']] and the Coast Guard ship [[CGS Sankalp|CGS ''Sankalp'']] arrived and assisted in [[rescue operation]]s. A week or so later, Indian naval forces of Operation Island Watch captured the ''Prantalay 11'', another former Thai trawler which had been captured by pirates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://navaltoday.com/2011/02/07/indian-navy-and-coast-guard-neutralize-pirate-mother-vessel/ Indian Navy and Coast Guard Neutralize Pirate Mother Vessel &gt;&gt;].

==Aftermath==
The Indian commander, Arun Bahuguna was awarded the [[Nao Sena Medal]] for his role in the engagement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.livefistdefence.com/2011/08/indias-i-day-gallantry-award-winners_14.html&lt;/ref&gt; The captured pirates were brought to India for trial where they were charged with kidnapping, kidnapping for ransom, attempted murder, and weapons related offenses. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/somali-pirates-sentenced-to-time-served#gs.1mYFKg8&lt;/ref&gt; As none of the pirate's former hostages appeared as witnesses, the pirates were acquitted of kidnapping for ransom and sentenced to seven years imprisonment on the remaining charges. The pirates had spent six and a half years in prison prior to their sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/somali-pirates-sentenced-to-time-served#gs.1mYFKg8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lambing in England -10March2012 (2).jpg|right|thumb|[[Lambing]]: the mother licks the first lamb while giving birth to the second]]
'''Birth''' is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth [[offspring]].&lt;ref&gt;"birth". [[OED Online]]. June 2013. Oxford University Press. [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/19395 Entry 19395] (accessed 30 August 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the [[uterus]] to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. In some species the offspring is [[precocial]] and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is [[altricial]] and completely dependent on parenting. In [[marsupial]]s, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short [[gestation]]al period and develops further in its mother's womb's  [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]].

It is not only mammals that give birth. Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them. Some of these are [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]], with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are [[Viviparity|viviparous]], with the [[embryo]] developing inside her body, as in mammals.

==Mammals==
Large [[mammal]]s, such as [[primate]]s, [[cattle]], [[horse]]s, some [[antelope]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[hippopotamus]]es, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[elephant]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]], [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s, generally are pregnant with one offspring at a time, although they may have twin or multiple births on occasion. In these large animals, the birth process is similar to that of a human, though in most the offspring is [[precocial]]. This means that it is born in a more advanced state than a human baby and is able to stand, walk and run (or swim in the case of an aquatic mammal) shortly after birth.&lt;ref name=Dorit/&gt; In the case of whales, dolphins and porpoises, the single calf is normally born tail first which minimises the risk of drowning.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Simmonds, ''Whales and Dolphins of the World'', New Holland Publishers (2007), Ch. 1, p. 32 {{ISBN|1845378202}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mother encourages the newborn calf to rise to the surface of the water to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://humpbackwhale.homestead.com/Humpback-Whale-Calf.html |title=Humpback Whale Calves |author=Crockett, Gary |year=2011 |publisher=Humpback whales Australia |accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most smaller mammals have multiple births, producing litters of young which may number twelve or more. In these animals, each fetus is surrounded by its own amniotic sac and has a separate placenta. This separates from the wall of the uterus during labor and the fetus works its way towards the birth canal.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Large mammals which give birth to twins is much more rare, but it does occur occasionally even for mammals as large as elephants. In April 2018,  approximately 8-month old [https://www.asiliaafrica.com/trunk-twins-elephant-twins-born-in-tarangire/ elephant twins] were sighted joining their mother's herd in the Tarangire National Park of Tanzania, estimated to have been born in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.asiliaafrica.com/trunk-twins-elephant-twins-born-in-tarangire/|title=Trunk Twins : Elephant Twins Born in Tarangire {{!}} Asilia Africa|date=2018-04-06|work=Asilia Africa|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans usually produce a single offspring at a time. The mother's body is prepared for birth by [[hormone]]s produced by the [[pituitary gland]], the [[ovary]] and the [[placenta]].&lt;ref name=Dorit&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=526–527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total [[gestation period]] from [[human fertilization|fertilization]] to birth is normally about 38 weeks (birth usually occurring 40 weeks after the last [[Menstruation|menstrual period]]). The normal process of childbirth takes several hours and has three stages. The first stage starts with a series of involuntary contractions of the muscular walls of the [[uterus]] and gradual dilation of the cervix. The active phase of the first stage starts when the cervix is dilated more than about 4&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and is when the contractions become stronger and regular. The head (or the buttocks in a [[breech birth]]) of the baby is pushed against the [[cervix]], which gradually dilates until is fully dilated at 10&amp;nbsp;cm diameter.  At some time, the [[amniotic sac]] bursts and the [[amniotic fluid]] escapes (also known as [[rupture of membranes]] or breaking the water).&lt;ref&gt;NICE (2007). Section 1.6, ''Normal labour: first stage''&lt;/ref&gt; In stage two, starting when the cervix is fully dilated, strong contractions of the uterus and active pushing by the mother expels the baby out through the [[vagina]], which during this stage of labour is called a birth canal as this passage contains a baby, and the baby is born with [[umbilical cord]] attached.&lt;ref&gt;NICE (2007). Section 1.7, ''Normal labour: second stage''&lt;/ref&gt; In stage three, which begins after the birth of the baby, further contractions expel the [[placenta]], amniotic sac, and the remaining portion of the umbilical cord usually within a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;NICE (2007). Section 1.8, ''Normal labour: third stage''&lt;/ref&gt;

Enormous changes take place in the newborn's circulation to enable [[breathing]] in air. In the uterus, the [[unborn baby]] is dependent on circulation of blood through the placenta for sustenance including gaseous exchange and the unborn baby's blood bypasses the lungs by flowing through the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], which is a hole in the septum dividing the [[right atrium]] and [[left atrium]]. After birth the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the baby starts to breathe air, and blood from the [[right ventricle]] starts to flow to the lungs for gaseous exchange and oxygenated blood returns to the [[left atrium]], which is pumped into the [[left ventricle]], and then pumped into the main arterial system.  As result of these changes, the blood pressure in the left atrium exceeds the pressure in the right atrium, and this pressure difference forces the foramen ovale to close separating the left and right sides of the heart. The [[umbilical vein]], [[umbilical arteries]], [[ductus venosus]] and [[ductus arteriosus]] are not needed for life in air and in time these vessels become ligaments (embryonic remnants).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Human Body Book |page=215 |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-8561-3007-3 |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |author1=Houston, Rob (editor) |author2=Lea, Maxine (art editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cattle===
[[File:Cow giving birth, in Laos (step by step).jpg|thumb|alt=Series of photos showing a cow giving birth|A cow giving birth]]
Birthing in [[cattle]] is typical of a larger mammal. A [[cow]] goes through three stages of labor during normal delivery of a calf. During stage one, the animal seeks a quiet place away from the rest of the herd.  Hormone changes cause soft tissues of the birth canal to relax as the mother's body prepares for birth. The contractions of the [[uterus]] are not obvious externally, but the cow may be restless. She may appear agitated, alternating between standing and lying down, with her tail slightly raised and her back arched. The fetus is pushed toward the birth canal by each contraction and the cow's [[cervix]] gradually begins to dilate. Stage one may last several hours, and ends when the cervix is fully dilated. Stage two can be seen to be underway when there is external protrusion of the [[amniotic sac]] through the vulva, closely followed by the appearance of the calf's front hooves and head in a front presentation (or occasionally the calf's tail and rear end in a posterior presentation).&lt;ref name=Alberta/&gt;  During the second stage, the cow will usually lie down on her side to push and the calf progresses through the birth canal. The complete delivery of the calf (or calves in a multiple birth) signifies the end of stage two. The cow scrambles to her feet (if lying down at this stage), turns round and starts vigorously licking the calf. The calf takes its first few breaths and within minutes is struggling to rise to its feet. The third and final stage of labor is the delivery of the [[placenta]], which is usually expelled within a few hours and is often eaten by the normally [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] cow.&lt;ref name=Alberta&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3451 |title=Calving |date=2000-02-01 |publisher=Alberta: Agriculture and Rural Development |accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ohio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/vme-fact/pdf/0029.pdf |title=Calving Management in Dairy Herds: Timing of Intervention and Stillbirth|year=2012 |publisher=The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine Extension |accessdate=2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dogs===
{{further|Canine reproduction#Gestation and litters}}
Birth is termed whelping in dogs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kustritz, M.|first=|year=2005|title=Reproductive behaviour of small animals|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/263302746/Conducta-Reproductiva-en-Pequenos-Animales|journal=Theriogenology|volume=64 |issue=3|pages=734–746|via=|doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2005.05.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[dog]]s, as whelping approaches, contractions become more frequent. Labour in the bitch can be divided into 3 stages. The first stage is when the cervix dilates, this causes discomfort and restlessness in the bitch. Common signs of this stage are panting, fasting, and/or vomiting. This may last up to 12hrs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stage two is the passage of the offspring.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[amniotic sac]] looking like a glistening grey balloon, with a puppy inside, is propelled through the [[vulva]].  After further contractions, the sac is expelled and the bitch breaks the membranes releasing clear fluid and exposing the puppy. The mother chews at the umbilical cord and licks the puppy vigorously, which stimulates it to breathe. If the puppy has not taken its first breath within about six minutes, it is likely to die.  Further puppies follow in a similar way one by one usually with less straining than the first usually at 15-60min intervals. If a pup has not been passed in 2 hrs a veterinarian should be contacted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Stage three is the passing of the placentas. This often occurs in conjunction with stage two with the passing of each offspring.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The mother will then usually eat the afterbirth.&lt;ref name=petmd&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petmd.com/dog/puppycenter/health/evr_dg_whelping_new_puppies_on_the_way |title=Whelping: New Puppies On The Way! |author=Dunn, T.J. |work=Puppy Center |publisher=Pet MD |accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an adaption to keep the den clean and prevent detection of predators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Marsupials===
{{see also|Marsupial#Reproductive system|Marsupial#Early development}}
[[File:Joey in pouch.jpg|thumb|A [[kangaroo]] joey firmly attached to a nipple inside the pouch]]
An infant [[marsupial]] is born in a very immature state. The gestation period is usually shorter than the intervals between oestrus periods. The first sign that a birth is imminent is the mother cleaning out her [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]]. When it is born, the infant is pink, blind, furless and a few centimetres long. It has nostrils in order to breathe and forelegs to cling onto its mother's hairs but its hind legs are undeveloped. It crawls through its mother's fur and makes its way into the pouch. Here it fixes onto a teat which swells inside its mouth. It stays attached to the teat for several months until it is sufficiently developed to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalworlds.org/thylacine/biology/reproduction/reproduction_5.htm |title=Reproduction and development |publisher=Thylacine Museum |accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joeys are born with "oral shields"; in species without pouches or with rudimentary pouches these are more developed than in forms with well-developed pouches, implying a role in maintaining the young attached to the mother's nipple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yvette Schneider Nanette | date = Aug 2011 | title = The development of the olfactory organs in newly hatched monotremes and neonate marsupials | url = | journal = J. Anat. | volume = 219 | issue = 2| pages = 229–242 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7580.2011.01393.x | pmc = 3162242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
Many reptiles and the vast majority of invertebrates, most fish, amphibians and all birds are [[Oviparity|oviparous]], that is, they lay eggs with little or no embryonic development taking place within the mother. In aquatic organisms, fertilization is nearly always external with sperm and eggs being liberated into the water (an exception is sharks and rays, which have internal fertilization&lt;ref&gt;Sea World, [http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-&amp;-rays/reproduction.htm Sharks &amp; Rays]; accessed 2013.09.09.&lt;/ref&gt;). Millions of eggs may be produced with no further parental involvement, in the expectation that a small number may survive to become mature individuals. Terrestrial invertebrates may also produce large numbers of eggs, a few of which may avoid predation and carry on the species. Some fish, reptiles and amphibians have adopted a different strategy and invest their effort in producing a small number of young at a more advanced stage which are more likely to survive to adulthood. Birds care for their young in the nest and provide for their needs after hatching and it is perhaps unsurprising that internal development does not occur in birds, given their need to fly.&lt;ref name=Attenborough&gt;{{cite book |title=The Trials of Life |last=Attenborough |first=David |year=1990 |publisher= |isbn=9780002199124 |pages=26–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovoviviparity]] is a mode of reproduction in which [[embryo]]s develop inside [[egg (biology)|egg]]s that remain in the mother's body until they are ready to hatch. Ovoviviparous animals are similar to [[viviparous]] species in that there is [[internal fertilization]] and the young are born in an advanced state, but differ in that there is no [[placenta]]l connection and the unborn young are nourished by [[egg yolk]]. The mother's body provides [[gas exchange]] (respiration), but that is largely necessary for oviparous animals as well.&lt;ref name=Attenborough/&gt; In many [[shark]]s the eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother's body and the embryos are nourished by the egg's yolk and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Kye R.|last2=Fetterplace|first2=Lachlan C.|last3=Davis|first3=Andrew R.|last4=Taylor|first4=Matthew D.|last5=Knott|first5=Nathan A.|title=Sharks, rays and abortion: The prevalence of capture-induced parturition in elasmobranchs|journal=Biological Conservation|date=January 2018|volume=217|pages=11–27|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2017.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lamniforme]] sharks practice ''[[oophagy]]'', where the first embryos to hatch consume the remaining eggs and [[sand tiger shark]] pups [[cannibal]]istically consume neighbouring embryos. The [[requiem sharks]] maintain a ''placental'' link to the developing young, this practice is known as [[viviparity]]. This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than to that of other fishes. In all these cases, the young are born alive and fully functional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-&amp;-rays/birth-&amp;-care.htm |title=Birth and care of young |work=Animals: Sharks and rays |publisher=Busch Entertainment Corporation |accessdate=2013-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803103514/http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/sharks-%26-rays/birth-%26-care.htm |archivedate=August 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of  [[caecilian]]s are ovoviviparous and give birth to already developed offspring. When the young have finished their yolk sacs they feed on nutrients secreted by cells lining the [[oviduct]] and even the cells themselves which they eat with specialist scraping teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03281-8 |pages=172–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alpine salamander]] (''Salamandra atra'') and several species of Tanzanian toad in the genus ''[[Nectophrynoides]]'' are ovoviviparous, developing through the larval stage inside the mother's oviduct and eventually emerging as fully formed juveniles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03281-8 |page=204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more developed form of [[viviparity]] called [[placenta|placental viviparity]] is adopted by  some species of [[scorpion]]s&lt;ref&gt;Capinera, John L., ''Encyclopedia of entomology''. Springer Reference, 2008, p. 3311.&lt;/ref&gt; and cockroaches,&lt;ref&gt;Costa, James T., ''The Other Insect Societies''. Belknap Press, 2006, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; certain genera of [[sharks]], [[snake]]s and [[velvet worm]]s. In these, the developing embryo is nourished by some form of placental structure. The earliest known placenta was found recently in a group of extinct fishes called [[Placodermi|placoderms]], which are ancestral to mammals. A fossil from [[Australia|Australia's]] [[Gogo Formation]], laid down in the [[Devonian]] period, 380 million years ago, was found with an embryo inside it connected by an [[umbilical cord]] to a [[yolk sac]]. The find confirmed the hypothesis that a sub-group of placoderms, called [[ptyctodontida|ptyctodontids]], fertilized their eggs internally. Some fishes that fertilize their eggs internally also give birth to live young, as seen here. This discovery moved our knowledge of live birth back 200 million years.&lt;ref name=dennis2008&gt;{{cite journal |title= Nature News: The oldest pregnant mum: Devonian fossilized fish contains an embryo |first= Carina |last= Dennis |date= 2008-05-28 |journal= Nature |doi= 10.1038/453575a |volume= 453 |issue= 7195 |page= 575 |bibcode= 2008Natur.453..575D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fossil of another genus was found with three embryos in the same position.&lt;ref name=long2008 &gt;{{cite journal |title= Live birth in the Devonian period |first= John A. |last= Long |first2= Kate |last2= Trinastic |first3= Gavin C. |last3= Young |first4= Tim |last4= Senden |date= 2008-05-28 |journal= Nature |doi= 10.1038/nature06966 |volume= 453 |issue= 7195 |pages= 650–652 |pmid=18509443|bibcode= 2008Natur.453..650L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Placoderms are a sister group of the ancestor of all living jawed fishes ([[Gnathostomata]]), including both [[Chondrichthyes|chondrichthyians]], the sharks &amp; rays, and [[Osteichthyes]], the bony fishes.

Among lizards, the [[viviparous lizard]] ''Zootoca vivipara'', [[Anguis|slow worms]] and many species of [[skink]] are viviparous, giving birth to live young. Some are ovoviviparous but others such as members of the genera ''[[Tiliqua]]'' and ''[[Corucia]]'', give birth to live young that develop internally, deriving their nourishment from a mammal-like placenta attached to the inside of the mother's uterus. In a recently described example, an African species, ''Trachylepis ivensi'', has developed a purely reptilian [[placenta]] directly comparable in structure and function to a mammalian placenta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blackburn DG, Flemming AF |title=Invasive implantation and intimate placental associations in a placentotrophic African lizard, Trachylepis ivensi (scincidae) |journal=J.

The majority of insects lay eggs but a very few give birth to offspring that are miniature versions of the adult.&lt;ref name=Attenborough/&gt; The [[aphid]] has a complex life cycle and during the summer months is able to multiply with great rapidity. Its reproduction is typically [[parthenogenetic]] and viviparous and females produce unfertilized eggs which they retain within their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8312.1979.tb00038.x| issn = 1095-8312| volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = 259–277| last = Blackman| first = Roger L| title = Stability and variation in aphid clonal lineages| journal = Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | year = 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The embryos develop within their mothers' [[ovarioles]] and the offspring are [[Cloning|clones]] of their mothers.

'''CAFFE''' stands for Coordinating Anthropological Film Festivals in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthropological-filmfestivals.eu/ CAFFE] Official webte&lt;/ref&gt; It is an initiative geared towards better cooperation and communication between the existing anthropological film festivals in Europe.

There are now courses in, and even centres of [[visual anthropology]] at several universities in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Further information see: http://www.easaonline.org/networks/vaneasa/teaching.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of students are 
enrolling in these courses, even short-term courses that merely scratch the 
surface of either visual anthropology or ethnographic filmmaking. &lt;ref&gt;On ethnographic Film see [http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0110.xml Ethnographic Film by Matthew Durington]&lt;/ref&gt;
Most importantly is the fact that we now have an abundance of film 
festivals in Europe that are linked to the fields of visual anthropology, 
visual culture, ethnographic film, and other forms of audio-visual 
media.  
Each event has its own features and foci, reflecting both trends in the 
academic environments from which they emanate, as well as the 
cultural diversity of the globalised world that surrounds them.

Currently CAFFE network brings together seventeen anthropological and ethnographic film festivals

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4771">'''Celebrancy''' is a movement to provide agents to officiate at ceremonies often reserved in law to [[clergy]] or officers of the courts. These agents, generally referred to as "celebrants", perform weddings, funerals, and other life ceremonies for those who do not want a traditional religious ceremony.

==Background==
Civil Celebrancy for independent community based officiants with ideals of meaningful ceremonies started in [[Australia]] due to the initiative of the Australian statesman and Attorney-General Lionel Murphy in 1973. He had very clear ideas on how secular people were entitled to ceremonies of equal dignity and substance as those enjoyed by religious people.&lt;ref name="Messenger III 2012"&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}} p.41ff&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, there is a division between the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[religion|religious]] aspects of marriages, and often one realm does not recognize the acts of the other. In Australia and New Zealand, there has been a long tradition of recognising civil and religious marriages as equal before the law.  The same legal procedures were (and are) required by clergy, state officials and independent civil celebrants.

In the [[United States]], however, clergy (and in some jurisdictions, the couple themselves, in a [[self-uniting marriage]]) perform legally binding weddings. However, in most states weddings not performed by such clergy must be performed by an officer of the court, such as a [[judge]] or a [[justice of the peace]].&lt;ref name="arizona"&gt;See for example {{cite web|
url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/25/00124.htm&amp;Title=25&amp;DocType=ARS|
title= Arizona Revised Statutes: 25-124. Persons authorized to perform marriage ceremony; definition |
accessdate=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These civil ceremonies typically are simple legal transactions. Such merely "legal transactions", except in exceptional cases, are totally rejected by civil marriage celebrants. The Murphy ideal for civil celebrants includes skill in combining, poetry, prose, music, choreography and movement,  storytelling and symbolism into ceremonies of substance and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.collegeofcelebrancy.com.au/Articles/keynote_afcc09.html|title=The Power of an Idea|accessdate=2014-01-11|publisher=International College of Celebrancy|author=[[Dally Messenger III]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In either case many couples felt the lack of the kind of ceremony more typically associated with religious services. In the same manner, funerals and rites of passage have been traditionally the province of the church or synagogue in western culture; those of a secular or unconventionally religious bent had felt the need for authentic and honest ceremonies - especially for Funerals.

To meet these needs, various groups arose to sponsor secular "ministers" to formulate and officiate at such rites. Existing [[humanism|humanist]] bodies (e.g. the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]) provide ministers who act as [[clergy]] under the law and are thus empowered to perform legally binding marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

The Cole Prize in algebra was funded by Cole himself, from funds given to him as a retirement gift; the prize fund was later augmented by his son, leading to the double award.&lt;ref name="richardson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pitcher"&gt;{{citation|title=A history of the second fifty years, American Mathematical Society 1939-88|first=Everett|last=Pitcher|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=1988|isbn=9780821896761|pages=51–54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JY3OxdP0h5cC&amp;pg=PA51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To be eligible for the Cole prize, the author must be a member of the American Mathematical Society or the paper should appear in a recognized North American journal.  The first award for algebra was made in 1928 to [[L. E. Dickson]], while the first award for number theory was made in 1931 to [[H. S. Vandiver]].&lt;ref name="pitcher"/&gt;

The ''' Edinburgh International Television Festival''' is an annual media event in the UK each August which brings together all parts of the television and digital world to debate the major issues facing the industry.

The Festival draws about 2,000 delegates from the major networks and production companies internationally.

Although the festival operates in Edinburgh, its headquarters are in London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetvfestival.com/about-us/contact-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and outline==
Over the years, the Festival has attracted some of the world’s most significant industry figures – including [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Rupert Murdoch]], [[Ted Turner]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Tessa Ross]], [[Jamie Oliver]], [[Simon Cowell]], [[Ted Sarandos]] and [[Elisabeth Murdoch (businesswoman)|Elisabeth Murdoch]], as well as people from related fields such as [[Al Gore]] and [[Germaine Greer]].

Established in 1976, the Festival takes place every August at the [[Edinburgh International Conference Centre]] concurrently with the [[Edinburgh International Festival]], and similar events, in the city. The Edinburgh International Television Festival remains the only event both run by and for the television industry as the Festival is governed by its Executive and Advisory committees. The Festival is a charitable organisation with a mission to identify and nurture the next generation of talent, whatever their background.

The Festival run two talent schemes – "The Network" (formerly known as TVYP) which gives brand new entrants a vital first step into the TV and digital industries while "Ones to Watch" (formerly known as Fast Track) supports those at the early stages of their career. Both benefit from fully funded places at the Festival, which include tailored workshops, masterclasses and networking. Year-round mentoring, training and events are also offered.

The Festival also runs other events throughout the year with the aim of engaging and inspiring the TV industry, these range from our punchy and provocative EdTalks lectures to Q &amp; A’s with channel bosses from across the globe.

==The MacTaggart Lecture==

The Festival is best known for its keynote address: the [[James MacTaggart]] Memorial Lecture. The lecture features speeches from leading media figures connected with  British and international television over more than 40 years:

'''Effects of domestic violence on children,''' result from witnessing [[domestic violence]] in a home where one of their parents are abusing the other parent, plays a tremendous role on the [[Quality of life|well-being]] and [[Child development|developmental growth]] of children witnessing the violence. In 2009 in the [[Philippines]], it was estimated that as many as 7 to 14 million children were exposed to domestic violence&lt;ref name="Eldeson"&gt;Edleson, J. L., Ellerton, A. L., Seagren, A. E., Kirchberg, S. O., &amp; Ambrose, A. T. (2007). Assessing child exposure to adult domestic violence. ''Children and Youth Services Review,'' 29(7), 961-971.&lt;/ref&gt; with about 3.3 million children exposed to domestic violence in their homes every year.&lt;ref name=acadv/&gt;

Children who witness domestic violence in the home often believe that they are to blame, live in a constant state of fear and are 15 times more likely to be victims of [[child abuse]]. Close observation during an interaction can alert providers to the need for further investigation and intervention, such as&lt;ref&gt;Stacy, W. and Shupe, A. ''The Family Secret.'' Boston, MA. Beacon Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; dysfunctions in the [[#Physical|physical]], [[#Behavioral|behavioral]], [[#Emotional|emotional]], and [[#Social|social]] areas of life, and can aid in early intervention and assistance for child victims.

==Symptoms children may have while witnessing==

==={{visible anchor|Physical symptoms|Physical}}===
In general, children who witness domestic violence in the home can suffer an immense amount of physical symptoms along with their emotional and behavioral state of [[Despair (emotion)|despair]]. These children may complain of general aches and pain, such as [[headache]]s and [[stomach ache]]s. They may also have irritable and irregular bowel habits, [[cold sore]]s, and they may have problems with [[bed-wetting]]. These complaints have been associated with depressive disorders in children, a common emotional effect of domestic violence. Along with these general complaints of not feeling well, children who witness domestic violence may also appear nervous, as previously mentioned, and have short [[attention span]]s. These children display some of the same symptoms as children who have been diagnosed with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]. On the reverse, these children may show symptoms of [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and constant tiredness. They may fall asleep in school due to the lack of sleep at home. Much of their night may be spent listening to or witnessing violence within the home. Children of domestic violence victims are often frequently ill, and may suffer from poor [[personal hygiene]]. Children who witness domestic violence also have a tendency to partake in high risk play activities, self-abuse, and [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=acadv&gt;[http://www.acadv.org/children.html ''The Effects of Domestic Violence on Children.''] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021103134717/http://www.acadv.org/children.html |date=2002-11-03 }} Alabama Coalition Against Domestic Violence.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prenatal====
The physical effects of domestic violence on children, different than the effects of direct abuse, can start when they are [[fetus]] in their mother's womb, can result in low infant [[birth weight]]s, [[premature birth]], excessive [[bleeding]], and [[fetal death]], due to the mother's [[trauma (medicine)|physical trauma]] and [[emotional stress]]. Increased maternal stress during the times of abuse, especially when combined with [[smoking]] and [[drug abuse]], can also lead to premature deliveries and low weight babies.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, G. (2005). Domestic violence and children: effects of domestic violence on children. ''Journal of Pediatric Health Care,'' 19(4):206-212.&lt;/ref&gt; When a woman is stressed while pregnant, the baby can be born with stress and anxiety and can sometimes have problems with growth.

====Infants====
Infant children who are present in the home where domestic violence occurs often fall victim to being "caught in the crossfire." They may suffer physical injuries from unintentional trauma as their parent is suffering from abuse. Infants may be inconsolable and irritable, have a lack of responsiveness secondary to lacking the emotional and physical attachment to their mother, suffer from [[developmental delay]]s, and have excessive [[diarrhea]] from both trauma and stress.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Infants are most affected by the environment of abuse because the child's brain hasn't fully developed.

====Older children====
Physical effects of witnessing domestic violence in older children are less evident than behavioral and emotional effects. The trauma that children experience when they witness domestic violence in the home, plays a major role in their [[child development|development]] and physical [[Quality of life|well being]]. Older children can sometimes turn the stress towards behavioral problems. Sometimes children who see the abuse turn to drugs, hoping to take the pain away. The children, however, will exhibit physical [[symptom]]s associated with their behavioral or emotional problems, such as being withdrawn from those around them, becoming non-verbal, and exhibiting regressed behaviors such as being clingy and whiney. [[Anxiety]] often accompanies a physical symptom in children who witness domestic violence in the home. If their anxiety progresses to more physical symptoms, they may show signs of tiredness from lack of sleep and weight and [[nutrition]]al changes from poor eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;Volpe, J. (1996). Effects of Domestic Violence on Children and Adolescents: An Overview. American Academy of Experts in Trauma Stress, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assessment====
Children who witness domestic violence in the home should be assessed for the physical effects and physical injuries. Some physical findings may be difficult to evaluate, like changes in their eating habits, sleep patterns, or bowel patterns should be further examined or questioned by someone whom they trust.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Behavioral symptoms===
Children exposed to domestic violence are likely to develop [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] problems, such as [[Regression (psychology)|regressing]], exhibiting out of control behavior,&lt;ref name=acadv/&gt; and imitating behaviors. Children may think that [[violence]] is an acceptable behavior of intimate relationships and become either the abused or the abuser. Some warning signs are bed-wetting, [[nightmare]]s, distrust of adults, acting tough, having problems becoming attached to other people and isolating themselves from their close friends and family. Another behavioral response to domestic violence may be that the child may lie in order to avoid [[social conflict|confrontation]] and excessive attention-getting.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In addition, to the behavioral symptoms of children, a source that supports this article is about a study that has been done by Albert Bandura (1977). The study that was presented was about introducing children to a role model that is aggressive, non-aggressive and a control group that showed no role model. This study is called, "The Bobo Doll Experiment", the experiment has influenced the children to act similar to their role model towards the doll itself. The children who were exposed to violence acted with aggression, the children who were exposed to a non-aggressive environment were quite friendly. As a result, children can be highly influenced by what is going on in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/bobo-doll.html|title=Bobo Doll Experiment {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolescents are in jeopardy of academic failure, school drop-out, and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name=cpfm&gt;[http://www.custodyprepformoms.org/haca.htm ''How are children affected by domestic violence?''] Custody Preparation for Moms. 2002 - 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their behavior is often guarded and secretive about their family members and they may become embarrassed about their home situation. Adolescents generally don't like to invite friends over and they spend their free time away from home. [[Denial]] and [[aggression]] are their major forms of problem-solving. Teens cope with domestic violence by blaming others, encountering violence in a relationship, or by running away from home.&lt;ref name=cpfm/&gt;

====Teen dating violence====
An estimated 1/5 to 1/3 of teenagers subject to viewing domestic violent situations experience [[teen dating violence]], regularly abusing or being abused by their partners verbally, mentally, emotionally, sexually and/or physically. 30 to 50% of dating relationships can exhibit the same cycle of escalating violence in their marital relationships.&lt;ref name=SASS&gt;[http://www.sassnh.org/ ''Sexual Assault Survivor Services''] (SASS) Facts about domestic violence. (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical symptoms===
Physical symptoms are a major effect on children due to parental domestic violence. In a study, 52% of 59 children yelled from another room, 53% of 60 children yelled from the same room, a handful actually called someone for help and some just became significantly involved themselves during the abusive occurrence. When the unfortunate violent situation is at its peak and a child tries to intervene, logically we would have thought that in order to save their child from harm, parents would control themselves, however, statistics show otherwise. It is said that about 50% of the abusers also end up abusing their children. Another alarming statistic is that 25% of the victims of the abusive relationship also tend to get violent with their children. The violence imposed on these children can in some cases be life-threatening. If a mother is pregnant during the abuse, the unborn child is at risk of lifelong impairments or at risk of life itself. Researchers have studied, amongst perinatal and neonatal statistics, mothers who experience domestic violence had more than double the risk of child mortality.

===Emotional symptoms===
Children exposed to violence in their home often have conflicting feelings towards their parents; For instance, [[distrust]] and [[affection]] often coexist for the abuser. The child becomes overprotective of the victim and feels sorry for them.&lt;ref name="lfcc.on.ca"&gt;Baker, L.L., Jaffe, P.G., Ashbourne, L. (2002). [http://www.lfcc.on.ca/ece-us.PDF ''Children Exposed to Domestic Violence.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

They often develop anxiety, fearing that they may be injured or abandoned, that the child's parent being abused will be injured, or that they are to blame for the violence that is occurring in their homes.&lt;ref name=Edleson1999&gt;Edleson, J.L., (1999) [http://new.vawnet.org/category/Main_Doc.php?docid=392 ''Problems Associated with Children's Witnessing of Domestic Violence.'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grief]], [[shame]], and low [[self esteem]] are common emotions that children exposed to domestic violence experience.&lt;ref name=Edleson1999/&gt;

====Depression====
[[Depression (clinical)|Depression]] is a common problem for children who experience domestic violence. The child often feels helpless and powerless. More girls internalize their emotions and show signs of depression than boys. Boys are more apt to act out with aggression and hostility.&lt;ref name=Edleson1999/&gt; Witnessing violence in the home can give the child the idea that nothing is safe in the world and that they are not worth being kept safe which contributes to their feelings of low self-worth and depression.

====Anger====
Some children act out through [[anger]] and are more aggressive than other children. Even in situations that do not call for it, children will respond with anger.&lt;ref&gt;Stannard, L. (2009). [http://www.livestrong.com/article/18332-emotional-effects-domestic-violence-children/ ''Emotional Effects of Domestic Violence on Children.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Children and young people particularly highlighted angry feelings as a consequence of experiencing domestive violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanley|first=Nicky|last2=Miller|first2=Pam|last3=Richardson Foster|first3=Helen|date=2012-05-01|title=Engaging with children's and parents' perspectives on domestic violence|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2206.2012.00832.x/abstract|journal=Child &amp; Family Social Work|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=192–201|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2206.2012.00832.x|issn=1365-2206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical aggression can also manifest towards the victim from the children as the woman does not have the ability to develop authority and control over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first=Stephanie|last2=Buckley|first2=Helen|last3=Whelan|first3=Sadhbh|date=2008-08-01|title=The impact of exposure to domestic violence on children and young people: a review of the literature|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=32|issue=8|pages=797–810|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2008.02.004|issn=0145-2134|pmid=18752848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post traumatic stress disorder====
[[Post traumatic stress disorder]] can result in children from exposure to domestic violence. Symptoms of this are nightmares, [[insomnia]], anxiety, increased alertness to the environment, having problems concentrating, and can lead to physical symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aardvarc.org/dv/effects.shtml ''An Abuse, Rape and Domestic Violence Aid and Resource Collection.''] (2008). Long-Term Effects of Domestic Violence.&lt;/ref&gt; If the child experiences chronic early maltreatment within the caregiving relationship, then [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] can result.

====Role reversal====
There is sometimes role reversal between the child and the parent and the responsibilities of the victim who is emotionally and psychologically dysfunctional are transferred to the child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parentification.ua.edu ''The Empirical Study of Parentification.'' Parentification Research.]&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, the parents treat their child as a therapist or confidant, and not as their child. They are forced to mature faster than the average child. They take on household responsibilities such as cooking, cleaning, and caring for younger children.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, C.J. (2001). [http://www.findcounseling.com/journal/domestic-violence/domestic-violence-children.html ''Effects of Domestic Violence on Children and Teenagers.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibilities that they take on are beyond normally assigned chores and are not age appropriate. The child becomes socially isolated and is not able to participate in activities that are normal for a child their age. The parentified child is at risk for becoming involved in rocky relationships because they have been isolated and are not experienced at forming successful relationships. Also, they tend to become perfectionists because they are forced to live up to such high expectations for their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J. (2010). [http://charactertherapist.blogspot.com/2010/06/t3-parentification.html ''Parentification.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social symptoms===
Children exposed to domestic violence frequently do not have the foundation of safety and security that is normally provided by the family. The children experience a [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]] to aggressive behavior, poor anger management, [[Learned helplessness|poor problem solving skills]], and learn to engage in exploitative relationships.&lt;ref name=acadv/&gt;

* Symptoms include isolation from friends and relatives in an effort to stay close to siblings and victimized parent.&lt;ref name=acadv/&gt;
* The adolescent may display these symptoms by joining a gang or becoming involved in dating relationships that mimic the learned behavior.&lt;ref name=acadv/&gt;

Children exposed to domestic violence require a safe nurturing environment and the space and respect to progress at their own pace. The caretaker should provide reassurance and an increased sense of security by providing explanations and comfort for the things that worry the children, like loud noises.&lt;ref name="lfcc.on.ca"/&gt; The children should develop and maintain positive contact with significant others such as distant family members.&lt;ref name="lfcc.on.ca"/&gt; All family members are encouraged to become involved in community organizations designed to assist families in domestic violence situations.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Effects on infants and toddlers==
[[File:Toddler in fright - nz 0457.jpg|thumb|200px|Frightened toddler]]
Children exposed to domestic violence at [[infancy]] often experience an inability to bond and form secure attachments, often resulting in intensified startle reactions and an inhibited sense of exploration and play.&lt;ref name="lfcc.on.ca"/&gt;

Children may portray a wide range of reactions to the exposure of domestic violence in their home. The [[preschool]] and [[kindergarten]] child does not understand the meaning of the abuse and may believe they did something wrong, this self-blame may cause the child feelings of guilt, [[worry]], and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Bermann, S. (1994). ''Preventing domestic violence.'' University of Michigan research information index.&lt;/ref&gt; Younger children do not have the ability to express their feelings verbally and these emotions can cause behavioral problems. They may become withdrawn, non-verbal, and have regressed behaviors such as clinging and whining. Other common behaviors for a child being a victim of domestic violence are eating and sleeping difficulty, and [[concentration]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  The Effects of Violent Experience and Maltreatment on Infants and Young Children.  In CH Zeanah (Ed.).  Handbook of Infant Mental Health—3rd Edition.

[[Preschoolers]] living with violence internalize the learned gender roles associated with [[victimization]], for instance seeing males as perpetrators and females as victims.&lt;ref name="lfcc.on.ca"/&gt; This symptom presents itself as the preschooler imitating learned behaviors of intimidation and abuse. The preschooler may present with aggressive behavior, lashing out, defensive behavior, or extreme separation anxiety from the primary caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E, McCaw J, Turner JB, Myers MM, Zeanah CH (2011).  The relationship of violent fathers, post-traumatically stressed mothers and symptomatic children in a preschool-age inner-city pediatrics clinic sample.  Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 26(18), 3699-3719.&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics show that a child who witnesses violence between their parents or guardian is more likely to carry on violent behaviors in their own adult lives. "Even when child witnesses do not suffer physical injury, the emotional consequences of viewing or hearing violent acts are severe and long-lasting. In fact, children who witness violence often experience many of the same symptoms and lasting effects as children who are victims of violence themselves, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)". Also in the article Breaking the Cycle of Violence "it is clearly in the best interest of the child and criminal justice system to handle child victims and witnesses in the most effective and sensitive manner possible. A number of studies have found the following: reducing the number of interviews of children can minimize psychological harm to child victims (Tedesco &amp; Schnell, 1987); testifying is not necessarily harmful to children if adequate preparation is conducted (Goodman et al., 1992; Oates et al., 1995; Whitcomb, Goodman, Runyon, and Hoak, 1994); and, having a trusted person help the child prepare for court and be with the child when he or she testified reduced the anxiety of the child (Henry, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Office of Victims of Crime, OVC Monograph.

===Dual exposure===
It is important to note that children exposed to domestic violence are more at risk for other forms of maltreatment such as physical abuse and neglect. Research suggests that parents who are violent with one another are at higher risk for physically abusing their children.&lt;ref name=Dong&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dong |first1=M |author2=Anda, R.F. |author3=Felitti, V.J. |author4=Dube, S.R. |author5=Williamson, D.F. |author6=Thompson, T.J. |author7=Loo, C.M. |author8=Giles, W.H. |title=The Interrelatedness of Multiple Forms of Childhood Abuse, Neglect, and Household Dysfunction |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |date=January 2004 |volume=28 |issue=7 |url=http://www.thecapcenter.org/admin/upload/ACEs%20Inter-Relatedness%20Article%202004.pdf |pages=771–84 |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2004.01.008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206234513/http://www.thecapcenter.org/admin/upload/ACEs%20Inter-Relatedness%20Article%202004.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has proposed that the consequences of child abuse and domestic violence exposure are often similar and mimic one another. Children who are abused and exposed to domestic violence exhibit emotional, psychological, and behavioral consequences that are almost identical to one another. In fact, some researchers refers to this dual exposure as the "double whammy" effect because children are receive double exposure to traumatic events and thus react twofold to the abuse and exposure to domestic violence. Emotionally children who experience the "double whammy" effect can exhibit fear, guilt, isolation, and low self-esteem. Additional psychological outcomes for these children include depression, anxiety, and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;ref name=Herrenkohl&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Herrenkohl, T. I. |author2=Sousa, C. |author3=Tajima, E. A. |author4=Herrenkohl, R. C. |author5=Moylan, C. A. |title=Intersection of Child Abuse and Children's Exposure to Domestic Violence |journal=Trauma Violence and Abuse |date=January 2008 |volume=2 |pages=84–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who experience dual exposure to both physical abuse and domestic violence possess more behavioral problems than those who experience only one or the other.&lt;ref name=Sousa&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sousa, C.|author2=Herrenkohl, T. I.|author3=Moylan, C. A.|author4=Tajima, E. A.|author5=Klika, J. B.|author6=Herrenkohl, R. C.|author7=Russo, M.

The long-term effects of dual exposure in young children can have very negative outcomes later in life. These outcomes have been documented as leading to behavioral problems that include school dropout, violence, teen pregnancy, substance abuse, eating disorders, and even suicide attempts.&lt;ref name="Herrenkohl"/&gt; A study following children from preschool through adolescence found that young children exposed to domestic violence and child abuse were more likely to experience anti-social behaviors in their adolescence. Young children exposed to both domestic violence and child abuse were also more likely to commit an assault and participate in delinquent behavior in their adolescence than those not exposed at all.&lt;ref name="Sousa"/&gt; Lastly, the [[Adverse Childhood Experiences (study)|Adverse Childhood Experiences study]] (ACE) found a connection between multiple categories of childhood trauma (e.g., child abuse, household dysfunction including domestic violence, and child neglect) and health/behavioral outcomes later in life. The more traumas a child was exposed to, the greater risk for disabilities, social problems and adverse health outcomes. More recently, researchers have used elements of this model to continue analysis into different aspects of trauma and stressful experiences and later development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dube, S. R. |author2=Felitti, V. J. |author3=Dong, M. |author4=Giles, W. H. |author5=Anda, R.

==Ways to help==
Early intervention is one of the best ways to counteract the effects of witnessing abuse. Ways to help children who have witnessed domestic abuse include:{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
* Arrange school age children to receive counseling from professionals at their school, often school counselors.
* Experiment with various types of counseling: play therapy, peer support groups, anger management classes and safety programs to teach kids how to extract themselves from dangerous situations.
* Help children find a loving and supportive adult to introduce to the child and encourage the child to spend as much time regularly with the adult. This may include a trusted family member or community advocate. [[Family Violence Defense Fund]] reports that the single most important ingredient to help children heal and develop resiliency is the presence of a loving adult.
* Provide a safe environment that does not include violence in any form after a child has witnessed domestic violence.
* Find ways to discipline that do not involve hitting, name-calling, yelling, or any form of verbally aggressive behavior.
* Help children create a sense of safety by having scheduled routines, such as regular meals and homework times.

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1985''' was the 30th edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was held on 4 May 1985 in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]]. The presenter was entertainer [[Lill Lindfors]], whose jokey dress rip after the interval act (seemingly revealing her knickers before unfolding another dress) was said to have not amused the wife of EBU scrutineer [[Frank Naef]].  Norwegian duo [[Bobbysocks!]] were the winners with the song "[[La det swinge]]".

Bobbysocks!' win for Norway was [[Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest|the country's first]]. Host Lill Lindfors congratulated the duo, [[Hanne Krogh]] and [[Elisabeth Andreassen|Elisabeth Andreasson]], following their victory by saying, "I must say I am honestly very happy that this happened because Norway has been last on so many times that you really deserve it!" Krogh replied, "''You're'' happy? What do you think ''we'' are?!" After an energetic reprise, the two women embraced to a [[standing ovation]] from the audience.

During the voting, it was not immediately evident that Norway would win the Contest. Germany took a commanding lead in the first half, with Norway fifth place behind Germany, Sweden, Italy and the United Kingdom around the end of the first half of voting. Finally, with five juries left, Germany, Sweden and Norway were tightly wrapped around the pole positions with 87, 86, and 85 points respectively. At that point, Sweden briefly took the lead away from Germany (who received no points from Switzerland). Sweden was the fourth-to-last jury, conceding their brief lead by awarding Germany eight points and Norway the maximum twelve. With only three countries left to vote, Norway kept the lead, in one of the shortest winning stretches during voting in the contest's history.

==Location==
{{details|topic=the host city|Gothenburg}}
[[File:Scandinavium 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Scandinavium, Gothenburg – host venue of the 1985 contest.]]
Gothenburg is the second-largest city in [[Sweden]] and the fifth-largest in the [[Nordic countries]]. Construction of the arena began in 1969 after decades of setbacks, and was inaugurated on 18 May 1971. Scandinavium is the home arena for [[Frölunda HC]] of [[Swedish Hockey League]], and venue for the annual [[Göteborg Horse Show]].

==Contest overview==
The [[Netherlands]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] did not participate in this Contest, due to the national [[Remembrance of the Dead]] in the Netherlands, and the anniversary of the death of [[Josip Broz Tito]] in Yugoslavia. Despite this [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] did choose its song: "[[Pokora (song)|Pokora]]" ("Penance") (music by [[Ivo Pupačić]] and lyrics by [[Zvonimir Pupačić]]), a duet sung by [[Zorica Kondža]] and [[Josip Genda]].

1985 was also the year when no less than thirteen previous Eurovision artists made a comeback. This also applied to the winners, Bobbysocks! who had attended once before as soloists: Hanne Krogh performed for Norway in 1971, while Elisabeth Andreassen for Sweden (where she is originally from) in 1982 in a duet, Chips, with Kikki Danielsson. Kikki herself also returned this year for host country Sweden, and was thus competing against Elisabeth Andreassen and Bobbysocks!.

[[Lys Assia]], the winner of [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|the first ever Eurovision Song Contest in 1956]], was the guest of honour of this thirtieth edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. She was introduced by the presenter [[Lill Lindfors]]. The camera zoomed close to Lys, who rose to greet the audience, while the orchestra played the song "[[Refrain (Lys Assia song)|Refrain]]", her winning song.

== Voting ==
Each country had a jury who awarded 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 point(s) for their top ten songs.

The voting itself was exciting, the German favourites looked to be cruising to an early victory. However both Sweden and Norway did their best to keep up and by the time the UK jury delivered their votes (only 1 point for Germany and 12 for Norway), Germany had seen its lead smashed.

Lill Lindfors had a [[wardrobe malfunction]] (though technically this is a misnomer, as the stunt was deliberate) as she proceeded to the stage for the voting procedure. As she walked on stage, the skirt of her dress came away, leaving her in just her underwear and the top half of her dress. After a few seconds of pretending to be shocked, Lindfors unfastened the flaps of her dress across her shoulders, to reveal a full-length white gown, much to raucous audience applause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://escfans.esctoday.com/multimedia/showVid.php?id=QZJlFIdG8R8]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710201247/http://escfans.esctoday.com/multimedia/showVid.php?id=QZJlFIdG8R8 |date=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lill then took her seat to start calling in the votes, and nonchalantly said, "I just wanted to wake you up a little."

'''[[Pristina]]''' had always a development in trading due to its position of the [[Balkan]] trade routes. Fairs in Pristina started since the medieval period, at the time when it was famous for its annual trade fairs and its goat hide and goat hair articles. Despite that fact Pristina, or [[Kosovo]] in general is not known for occurrence of fairs. With the development of culture and especially after  the last war in 1999, Pristina had a progress on holding these kinds of events.
Every year  various  types of trade fairs take place in the capital city. The essence of these fairs is usually temporary; some last only an afternoon while others may last around 3&amp;nbsp;days, a week or even longer. They have grown in size and importance over the years. These fairs are organized annually and are open to trade visitors and public. The number of exhibitors and visitors is usually very high.

===Ditet e diaspores===
During the traditional festival called "Ditet e Diaspores " took place one of the most important fairs which included domestic products. Most of all there were women who participated in addition to promote their homemade products. There were displayed craft products, dairy products, honey etc., to show their ability in making business and leadership. This is one of many work of the tireless Albanian women. Ministry of Diaspora estimated that these days through these fairs there has been an increase of the cooperation between local business and Diaspora. It is also helpful of raising the awareness about the consumption of domestic production and promote as much economic development.

====Vullneti i Grave====
"Vullneti i Grave" participated in a fair organized by the Ministry of Diaspora in June and in the five-day 'Handicrafts and Cultural Heritage Fair 2013' organized by the NGO 'Open Door' which is held every year in September in Pristina. With every fair, the women honed their skills in talking to customers and in displaying their products. Using that knowledge, Vullneti i Grave even organized their own fair with the support of DRC's implementing partner, NGO Lulebora. The Vullneti i Grave fair brought together five NGO's and women's groups from Mitrovicë/a and Fushë Kosova, giving them the opportunity to exhibit and sell their products on Mother Teresa Square in Pristina. During July 27, 28 and 29, Ministry of Diaspora has organized a fair of the local products including food, crafts, souvenirs, jewellery and flowers. Twelve members of the Gratë në Biznes have successfully attended this fair. Sale of the products started early in the morning and lasted until the late night hours. Customers were very satisfied with the offered products. Some of them have required that Pristina should organize weekly market / fair where women can sell their unique and special products.

===Book Fair===
One of the most successful ways for books to be closer with the readers is the traditional organization of Pristina's book fair and the participation of Kosovo's publishers with common stand at the fair on the world renowned - Frankfurt. So far there have been organized 15 fairs, every year. The next 16th traditional fair will be held on 03–8 June. The first book fair took place on 17 to 22 November 1999 but others were organized during May and June. The number of participants is about 100 publishers, mostly from Kosovo, Albania, Macedonia, Diaspora.&lt;ref name="youname-it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youname-it.com/panairi/site/index.php?p=0|title=Panairi i 15t&amp;euml; i librit - Prishtina 2013 &amp;#124; 3-9 qershor|publisher=youname-it.com|accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trtalbanian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trtalbanian.com/trtworld/al/newsDetail.aspx?HaberKodu=13369117-2bfa-4eae-a3c7-49989b5db72d|title=Kosovë - Mbyllet Panairi i Librit "Prishtina 2013", mbi 30 mijë vizitorë/TRT - Shqip|publisher=trtalbanian.com|accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Formula 3 Latin-America Berta engine.jpg|thumb|right|A ''Berta'' engine]]

'''Formula 3 Sudamericana''' was a [[South America]]n [[Formula Three]] championship. It was inaugurated in 1987 and primarily held races in [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]], with a small number of events held in other countries across the continent. Its most notable graduates include former [[Formula One]] drivers [[Nelson Piquet, Jr.]], [[Ricardo Zonta]] and [[Christian Fittipaldi]], three-time [[Indianapolis 500]] winner [[Hélio Castroneves]], and [[Champ Car]] champion and former F1 driver [[Cristiano da Matta]]. The series was replaced for 2014 by the [[Brazilian Formula Three Championship]], which focuses on Brazilian circuits and drivers.

==Background==
Prior to the creation in 1987 of a regional Formula Three championship in South America, the '''Codasur championship''' was held annually between 1983 and 1986.&lt;ref name="speedracing1"&gt;[http://speedracing.50webs.com/h_formula3.html Speed Racing - História da Fórmula 3]&lt;/ref&gt; This series utilised local chassis or [[Formula Three]] chassis with Renault or Volkswagen 1500–1600cc engines. Each of the four drivers' championship titles went to [[Guillermo Maldonado (racing driver)|Guillermo Maldonado]] of [[Argentina]]. Maldonado, like many of his contemporaries, also functioned as a team owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrovisoronline.com.br/Home_index/album/slides/artigos/43%20-%20f3%20e%20gt3.htm Retrovisor Online - F3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Codasur Championship's team owners and the [[Sport governing body|governing bodies]] of national motorsport in the region began collectively to discuss its replacement with a current European or worldwide formula. They wanted a formula that would provide young South American drivers with experience that would be relevant when, or if, they had the opportunity to further their career internationally. The long-established [[Formula Three]] was the obvious choice.

[[Petrobras]] was announced as the official sponsor of the 2010 season of Formula 3 South America. The agreement, made possible through the [[Law for Encouragement of Sport]] – [[Sports Ministry]] – was worth $3 million and valid for a period of 12 months.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The project also includes the acquisition of naming rights category, which from this year has been renamed Formula 3 Sudamericana Petrobras. The Brazilian oil company is also the official supplier of fuel and lubricant for all cars in Formula 3. Even under the contract are the development and implementation of events, promotions, and [[marketing]].

==Equipment==
However, despite the ready availability of second-hand F3 chassis and engines, the organisers of the new championship commissioned their own chassis to F3 specification, which was built in Argentina by veteran [[TC 2000 Championship]] driver and engineer [[Oreste Berta]]'s eponymous company. The Berta Mk3 was used exclusively during 1987, until the championship was opened up to other suppliers in the following year. From 1988 until the mid-1990s, chassis from [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]], [[Ralt]], [[TOM'S|TOM's]] and [[Dallara]] were in common use, but at that point, Dallara's increasing performance advantage had the same effect in South America as it had in Europe, and it became the de facto choice.

Since 2005, the series organisers have sought to keep budget requirements under stricter control by using a "control specification" engine, which is produced by Berta. It has considerably reduced running budgets since its introduction, not least because the teams are permitted to service the engines themselves. The Berta engine is used by all ''Class A'' entrants, but competitors in ''Class B'', or ''Light'', are still using other customer engines such as [[Mugen-Honda]] in a significantly older chassis. ''Class A'' entrants used the five-year-old Dallara F301 in 2006, while ''Light'' entrants used the F394 from 1994. F3 chassis are designed to a three-year lifecycle, with only minor annual updates.

==Venues==
During this early era, the championship very much lived up to its title, with events in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]]. Between 2002 and 2008, the series has limited itself to events in Brazil and Argentina. The Grand Prix of [[Piriápolis]] returned to the series in 2009. Local economic issues have tended to limit the potential for the maintenance and development of motor racing venues, which means that only the most popular circuits can afford to support the championship.

==Scoring system==
* The scoring system for 2010 replicates the new system introduced into [[Formula One]]:
{| class="wikitable"
! Position || 1st || 2nd || 3rd || 4th || 5th || 6th || 7th || 8th || 9th || 10th
|-
! Points || 25 || 18 || 15 || 12 || 10 || 8 || 6 || 4 || 2 || 1
|}

==Teams and drivers==
Economics also plays a part in the [[demography]] of the competitors. Since its inception, F3 Sudamericana has been primarily the domain of Brazilian and Argentine drivers and teams, but that imbalance has worsened in this decade, with very few drivers from countries other than Brazil. Since 2001, there has been only one race that was not won by a Brazilian driver. Last year, just a small number of Argentine drivers competed in the series, and only in events on home soil.

In recognition of this shortcoming, the series' organisers and race promoters are working harder to make it an attractive and suitable proposition for drivers from the smaller South American nations. In addition to the cost reductions, steps have been taken to improve its public popularity, and hence, the marketing potential. This year,{{When|date=February 2011}} F3 Sudamericana will share its Brazilian venues with that country's [[Trofeo Maserati]] championship.

In spite of its economic limitations, and its relative geographical remoteness from the major centres of motorsport, F3 Sudamericana has nonetheless produced a number of recognised and notable drivers who have since established themselves in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. In addition to Castroneves and da Matta, the series' alumni include other [[Champ Car]] drivers past and present, such as [[Christian Fittipaldi]] (the nephew of [[Emerson Fittipaldi|Emerson]]) and [[Bruno Junqueira]]. Competing in the [[GP2 Series|GP2]] championship are 2003 runner-up [[Lucas di Grassi]] and 2004 champion [[Alexandre Sarnes Negrão]].

'''Getting lost''' is the occurrence of a person or animal losing spatial reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Paul A. Dudchenko}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CR4XqpciW7IC&amp;lpg=PP11&amp;dq=getting%20lost&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=getting%20lost&amp;f=false ''Why People Get Lost: The Psychology and Neuroscience of Spatial Cognition''] (Oxford, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This situation consists of two elements: the feeling of [[disorientation]] and a spatial component.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|K.

==Process==
[[File:Maze.JPG|{{largethumb}}|In a [[maze]] one can get lost on a voluntary basis]]
[[Psychology]] and [[neuroscience]] help to understand the underlying processes which take place before, during and after getting lost. Getting lost is an aspect of [[behavioral geography]], in which human [[wayfinding]] and cognitive and environmental factors play a role. For successful travel, it is necessary to be able to identify origin and destination, to determine turn angles, to identify segment lengths and directions of movement, to recognize on route and distant landmarks. This information is required to plot a course designed to reach a destination (previously known or unknown) or to return to a home base after wandering. If a destination is known but is not directly connected by a path, road, or track to the origin, successful travel may involve search and exploration, spatial updating of one's location, finding familiar landmarks, recognition of segment length and sequencing, identification of a frame of reference. Human movement is often guided by external aids (cartographic maps, charts, compasses, pedometers, and the like).&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Reginald G. Golledge}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=TjzxpAWiamUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=cognitive+processes+and+geography&amp;ots=T8W1z316N9&amp;sig=PZ71cLoy1udZjvK4fsLMP76YRzw#v=onepage&amp;q=cognitive%20processes%20and%20geography&amp;f=false ''Wayfinding Behavior: Cognitive Mapping and Other Spatial Processes''] (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Getting lost is particularly problematic for children (who have not yet developed tools and strategies for maintaining their bearings) and for the [[elderly]], particularly those experiencing the onset of [[dementia]].&lt;ref name="Rudd"&gt;Betty Rudd, ''Introducing Psychopathology'' (2013), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals "can get lost while trying to find their local shop – due to their diminishing memory they can forget where the shop is, or where they live and why they went out of their house in the first place".&lt;ref name="Rudd"/&gt; People experiencing dementia also get lost more easily in poor visibility conditions because the mind fails to appropriately fill in cues as to missing landmarks.&lt;ref name="Rudd"/&gt; Getting lost in unfamiliar terrain can lead even an adult with a healthy mind to [[panic]] and engage in unthinking behaviors that make the situation even worse.&lt;ref name="Huth"&gt;John Edward Huth, ''The Lost Art of Finding Our Way'' (2013), p. 30-38.&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency of the mind to seek patterns and familiar signs can contribute to this in two ways. First the lost person may mistake features of the terrain for markers that were seen before they became lost, creating a false sense of orientation that may lead the lost person to pursue routes that take them even further off course. Second, the lost person may mistake such features for markers that were seen ''after'' they became lost, creating a false sense that they have made a circle and returned to an earlier point of their effort to find their bearings.&lt;ref name="Huth"/&gt;

==Historical occasions==
There have been some historically notable instances of people getting lost and either being rescued or dying. [[George Shannon (explorer)|George Shannon]], the youngest adult member of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] got lost on two occasions after being separated from the expedition. On August 26, 1804, he was sent to retrieve two pack horses; he was separated from the party for sixteen days and nearly starved, as he went without food for twelve days except for some grapes and rabbits. At first he thought he was behind the expedition, so he sped up thinking he could catch up.  Then, getting hungry, he went downstream to look for a trading party he could stay with. Finally [[John Colter]] was sent to find him. The second time was on August 6, 1805, when the expedition was at the [[Three Forks, Gallatin County, Montana|Three Forks]]. Shannon was dispatched up a fork the party had named Wisdom (the middle fork was named Jefferson and the placid fork, Philanthropy). He rejoined the party after three days by backtracking to the forks and following the trail of the others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Hs40SqVO0tIJ:www.heinzhistorycenter.org/secondary.aspx%3Fid%3D55%26contentID%3D494+lewis+and+clark+pittsburgh+1803&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiPP2H7MEk7K8VINv8XQ0R4_gfv-abmcUwhmM4BHIye7up3Cf2BQgWhGAepUQDGk_Y_ljhM57MzjJFozGtijoN-vkPszpY1JuKBVpAR-sf8hJZsukRAnxGNYO5cE4UcP6gDRqc3&amp;sig=AHIEtbSCubTHn2lUz2h2yZ9kTwIlt5lwxA "Chapter 4: Lewis and Clark".]  Heniz History Center exhibit.  Retrieved 2011-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Muir]] wrote in his journals of an occasion when a visiting artist named Billy Simms "went forth to sketch while I was among the glaciers, and got lost - was thirty-six hours without food".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Muir]], in William Frederic Badè, ''The Writings of John Muir'' (1923), Vol. 9, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; Mentally ailing Church of England mission priest [[Alexander Mackonochie]] died after getting lost on December 14, 1887, while walking in the [[Mamore Forest|Forest of Mamore]], near [[Loch Leven (Highlands)|Loch Leven]], Scotland: the circumstances were later commemorated in a poem by [[William McGonagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGonagall|first=William|title=The Tragic Death of the Rev. A. H. Mackonochie|url=http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk/gems/the-tragic-death-of-the-rev-a-h-mackonochie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, Soviet and Russian mathematician [[Alexey Chervonenkis]] got lost in [[Losiny Ostrov National Park]]; a later search operation found him dead near [[Mytishchi]], a suburb of Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/26285/3163696/|script-title=ru:Известный ученый Алексей Червоненкис погиб в Москве|publisher=kp.ru|date=23 September 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
People are sometimes depicted in fiction and literature as getting lost, with substantial consequences. For example, due to "the physical structure of [[Rome]], whose streets were notoriously labyrinthine", it has been observed that "getting lost in Rome was staple of travel narratives".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wrigley, ''Regarding Romantic Rome'' (2007), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of getting lost is also a commonly reported theme of [[dream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Gislason, ''Neuroscience Notes'' (2015), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[halter (horse show)|halter]] horses in the [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] and [[American Saddlebred]] breeds, high tail carriage and animation are desired traits. However, nearly all [[horse show]] sanctioning organizations in the U.S. explicitly forbid gingering and have the authority to disqualify a horse treated in this way.  While some areas may be less than rigorous about enforcing the rule, tests such as "ginger swabbing" may be done to detect the presence of ginger in the anus.  While it is not entirely reliable, concerns of being detected by anal tests has led to some horse handlers placing the irritant in the vagina if the horse is a [[mare]].  A modern veterinary dictionary notes that vaginal placement is more effective than anal insertion, because the irritant is likely to remain in place longer, and concludes gingering "would be considered to be an act of cruelty in any civilized community".&lt;ref NAME="VET"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/ginger?cat=health ''Gingering''] in the ''Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary'', 2007 edition, by D.C.

==History and growth==
The inaugural edition of this techno-management symposium was in the year 2004 when it was named Ideon. The fest had a participation of about 260 students from outside IIT Kharagpur. The participation has since grown exponentially, and it has now become Asia’s largest fest of its kind.

The year 2005 saw a massive growth in the participation of students from outside the institute, with a participation of about 1400, including people from abroad.

In 2006, Kshitij hosted about 3,000 in-house and 2,000 outstation participants, who took part in 20 events spread across various genres, vying for the chance to grab prizes worth Rs. 15 lakhs. It also witnessed guest lectures from eminent personalities like Prof. Klaus Von Klitzing(Nobel prize in Physics 1985) who was also the judge of the finals of the technical paper presentation event Eureka,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/2005/12/12/stories/2005121206040500.htm&lt;/ref&gt; R. Chidambaram (Principal Scientific Advisor to the Govt. of India), Lord Sushanto Kumar Bhattacharyya (Scientific Advisor to the Govt of South Africa and  Warwick Manufacturing Group's Director) and Dr. Praveen Chaudhari(Director, Brookhaven Laboratory). The flagship events of the fest at that time were Eureka, CarXs (a competition to design the seating arrangement of SUVs) and Mission Mars (a programming contest).

Kshitij 2007&lt;ref&gt;https://www.campuskarma.in/photos/album/13982/kshitij-2007&lt;/ref&gt; was held from 1–4 February, with the Egyptian civilisation as the chosen theme, as a homage to the pathbreaking technical expertise and the rich cultural heritage of one of the world’s earliest civilisations. The 35 events with prizes worth Rs. 30 lakhs, providing a confluence of technology and business skills, were extremely well received. Prior to the fest, robotics workshops were held in cities like Kolkata, Hyderabad&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/technomanagement-fest-at-iitkharagpur/article3215054.ece&lt;/ref&gt; and Jaipur. The fest itself was a massive success, with people like Wg. Cmdr. Rakesh Sharma,&lt;ref&gt;https://seraphic.wordpress.com/2007/03/28/kshitij-2007-an-overview/&lt;/ref&gt; ad-guru Alyque Padamsee, Nobel laureate Prof. Paul Krutzen sharing anecdotes from their life. The events Eureka, BPlan (the business plan presentation event) and Overnite (a night-long coding event) were yet again hugely successful. The fest also witnessed awe-inspiring exhibitions from across the world, some of which included a next-generation flying mechanical bird (an ‘’Ornithopter’’).

In 2008, Kshitij was attended by 3500 outstation students from all over the country. The fest consisted of engaging guest lectures by people like the co-founder of Wikipedia, Mr. Jimmy Wales, the father of Nano-Technology Mr. Eric Drexler, the world famous theoretical physicist and author of the bestseller ‘Physics of Star-Trek’, Prof. Lawrence M. Krauss. There was also a video conference by the  Nobel Laureate in Chemistry for genetic information transfer from DNA to RNA, Prof. Roger D Kornberg.

Pursuant to the Disengagement Plan, Israel dismantled all military institutions and settlements in Gaza and there is no longer a permanent Israeli military or civilian presence in the territory. However the Plan also provided that Israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, will continue to maintain exclusive authority in Gaza air space, and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip as well as maintaining an Israeli military presence on the Egyptian-Gaza border. and reserving the right to reenter Gaza at will. &lt;br&gt;Israel continues to control six of Gaza's seven land crossings, its maritime borders and airspace and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory. Egypt controls one of Gaza's land crossings. Troops from the Israeli Defence Force regularly enter pans of the territory and/or deploy missile attacks, drones and sonic bombs into Gaza. Israel has declared a no-go buffer zone that stretches deep into Gaza: if Gazans enter this zone they are shot on sight. Gaza is also dependent on Israel for water, electricity, telecommunications and other utilities, currency, issuing IDs, and permits to enter and leave the territory. Israel also has sole control of the Palestinian Population Registry through which the Israeli Army regulates who is classified as a Palestinian and who is a Gazan or West Banker. Since 2000 aside from a limited number of exceptions Israel has refused to add people to the Palestinian Population Registry.&lt;br&gt;It is this direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza that has led the United Nations, the UN General Assembly, the UN Fact Finding Mission to Gaza, International human rights organisations, US Government websites, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and a significant number of legal commentators, to reject the argument that Gaza is no longer occupied.|doi=10.1007/978-90-6704-811-8_14}}&lt;br&gt;* {{cite book|title=International Law and the Classification of Conflicts|editor=Elizabeth Wilmshurst|first=Iain|last=Scobbie|authorlink=Iain Scobbie|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2012|isbn=978-0-19-965775-9|page=295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GM90Xp03uuEC&amp;pg=PA295|quote=Even after the accession to power of Hamas, Israel's claim that it no longer occupies Gaza has not been accepted by UN bodies, most States, nor the majority of academic commentators because of its exclusive control of its border with Gaza and crossing points including the effective control it exerted over the Rafah crossing until at least May 2011, its control of Gaza's maritime zones and airspace which constitute what Aronson terms the 'security envelope' around Gaza, as well as its ability to intervene forcibly at will in Gaza.}}&lt;br&gt;* {{cite book|title=Prefiguring Peace: Israeli-Palestinian Peacebuilding Partnerships|first=Michelle|last= Gawerc|publisher=Lexington Books|date=2012|isbn=9780739166109|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hka8FZ4UdWUC&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=While Israel withdrew from the immediate territory, it remained in control of all access to and from Gaza through the border crossings, as well as through the coastline and the airspace.

Israel maintains direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza: it controls Gaza's air and maritime space, and six of Gaza's seven land crossings. It reserves the right to enter Gaza at will with its military and maintains a no-go buffer zone within the Gaza territory.

The '''Mugam Festival''' or '''Shusha Festival''' is an annual cultural and musical festival held in [[Shaki, Azerbaijan]]. The festival features traditional Azerbaijani music known as [[mugam]].

==Pioneers==
One of the major pioneers of this festival was [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]] who was a [[People's Artist of the USSR]] in 1938. Hajibeyov dedicated his life to preserve the traditional music of Azerbaijan. Another pioneer was [[Rashid Behbudov]], also the winner of [[People's Artist of the USSR]], who participated in every festival.
The Mugham Festival was founded and is traditionally celebrated in the Azerbaijani city of [[Shusha]]. The last Mugham Festival in Shusha took place in 1988. Because of the conflict in the [[Karabakh]] region, Shusha has been occupied by [[Armenia]]n forces since 1992 and all Azeris have fled the city. Today the festival lives on and has been held in Shaki since November 1994. Every year thousands of people participate in the festival.

==Children's festival==
The Children's Mugham Festival, which is also held in Shaki, has emerged from the Mugham Festival. During the Children's Mugham Festival, many talented children, mainly refugees from the occupied regions of Azerbaijan, get the chance to share their music and sing to a large crowd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6367">'''''Nibelungentreue''''' is a [[German compound|German compound noun]], literally "[[Nibelung]] loyalty", expressing the concept of absolute, unquestioning, excessive and potentially disastrous [[loyalty]] to a cause or person. 

It is derived from the medieval [[chivalric code|chivalric]] ideal of loyalty, [[Middle High German]] ''[[:wikt:triuwe|triuwe]]'', as exemplified in the second part of the [[Nibelungenlied]], where the Burgundian kings Gunther, Gernot and Giselher refuse to hand over to [[Kriemhild]] their loyal vassal [[Hagen (legend)|Hagen of Tronje]], who is guilty of murdering Kriemhild's husband, Siegfried. The brothers place the loyalty to their friend above their obligations to their sister or to justice, leading to disaster and the complete destruction of the Nibelungs. 

The modern term ''Nibelungentreue'' was coined by chancellor [[Bernhard von Bülow]] in his speech before the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] on 29 March 1909. Addressing the [[Bosnian crisis]], von Bülow invoked the absolute loyalty between the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] to their [[Dual Alliance (1879)|Alliance of 1879]] against the threat by the [[Entente cordiale]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Fürst Bülows Reden'' ed.  Wilhelm von Massow. vol. 5. Leipzig 1914,  127f.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Meine Herren, ich habe irgendwo ein höhnisches Wort gelesen über eine Vasallenschaft gegenüber Österreich-Ungarn. Das Wort ist einfältig. [...] aber die Nibelungentreue wollen wir aus unserem Verhältnis zu Österreich‐Ungarn nicht ausschalten. Die wollen wir vor aller Öffentlichkeit Österreich‐Ungarn gegenüber wahren.''
:"Gentlemen &amp;mdash; I have somewhere read a scornful word regarding a [German] vassalage to Austria-Hungary. This is fatuous. [...] but we will not eliminate the ''Nibelung loyalty'' from our relation to Austria-Hungary. This we want to preserve towards Austria-Hungary in full public view."
The term is adopted by emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany]] as the German Empire [[July Crisis|declared war]] alongside Austria-Hungary on 1 August 1914.
After the defeat of the Central Powers in 1918, the notion of the ''[[Stab-in-the-back myth|Dolchstoß]]'' also invoked the Nibelungen legend, invoking the cowardly  murder of Siegfried.&lt;ref&gt;''Wie Siegfried unter dem hinterlistigen Speerwurf des grimmigen Hagen, so stürzte unsere ermattete Front'' ("Like Siegfried falling under the cowardly spear-throw of grim Hagen, so fell our exhausted front") [[Paul von Hindenburg]], ''Aus meinem Leben''. Hirzel, Leipzig 1920, p. 403, cited after  Jesko von Hoegen, ''Der Held von Tannenberg. Genese und Funktion des Hindenburg-Mythos''. Böhlau,  2007, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nibelungentreue''  was later, in [[East Germany]] during [[denazification]] and by the 1980s also in West Germany, applied (derogatively) to [[Nazi ideology]], especially in connection with the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' motto, ''[[Meine Ehre heißt Treue]]''. Used in this sense by [[Marxist]] commentators, the term describes a fanatical "[[furor Teutonicus|Germanic]]" military loyalty associated with [[fascism]] and [[militarism]].
&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Erik Hoevels, ''Marxismus, Psychoanalyse, Politik'', Ahriman-Verlag GmbH, 1983 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=Vt69KEwDRDAC&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 243].
&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Franz Fühmann]] in 1955 wrote a poem called ''Der Nibelunge Not'' ("the plight/distress of the Nibelungs", the Middle High German title of the ''Nibelungenlied'') in which he portrays the Nibelungs as a Germanic ''Töterdynastie'' ("dynasty of killers") who brought a curse on their descendants.&lt;ref&gt; 
Dennis Tate, ''Franz Fühmann, Innovation and Authenticity: A Study of His Prose-writing'', Rodopi, 1995, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=yr5Iw1Ybqn4C&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 37&amp;ndash;39].&lt;/ref&gt;
The term is also occasionally found in English-language literature about Nazi Germany; thus, Steinberg (1990) describes [[Goebbels]]' suicide as "a paroxysm of ''Nibelungentreue''".&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Steinberg, ''All Or Nothing: The Axis and the Holocaust, 1941-1943'',  Psychology Press, 1990, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=jYQgiSTUQP4C&amp;pg=PA137 p. 137].&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on this association with fascism and militarism, the term has a derogatory or ironic connotation;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Nibelungentreue duden.de]: "oft abwertend".&lt;/ref&gt; it describes any excessive or blind loyalty which in the speaker's opinion is bound to lead to disaster; it is frequently used in [[Criticism of the Israeli government|pro-Palestinian]] journalism denouncing the alliance between of USA or Germany [[Foreign relations of Israel|with Israel]],&lt;ref&gt; ''Die deutsche Politik gegenüber Israel verwechselt Solidarität mit Nibelungentreue.'' ("German policy towards Israel confuses solidarity with ''Nibelungentreue''.") Michael Lüders, [http://www.theeuropean.de/michael-lueders/4441-deutsche-atom-u-boote-fuer-israel "Merkels skandalöse Nibelungentreue"], ''The European'' 12 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
or in contexts such as the American-British alliance leading to the ill-fated [[2003 invasion of Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;''Blairs Entscheidung, im Umgang mit der westlichen Supermacht mögliche Differenzen niemals in die Öffentlichkeit zu tragen, verschärft den Eindruck blinder Nibelungentreue.'' ("Blair's decision to never publicize possible differences with the western superpower reinforces the impression of blind ''Nibelungentreue''" Jürgen Krönig, [http://www.zeit.de/online/2006/31/Israel-Bush-Blair "Blinde Nibelungentreue?"], ''Zeit'', 28 July 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also used (with an ironical connotation) in unpolitical contexts such as [[sports journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Osterhaus, "Der deutsche Nationaltrainer Joachim Löw", ''[[NZZ]]'', 21 June 2014 (describes [[Joachim Löw]] as ''nibelungentreu'' towards his players [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] and  [[Miroslav Klose]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

She came across the body of Kurdi on the beach and took a number of photos.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

==Photo of dead toddler==
[[File:Alan Kurdi lifeless body.jpg|thumb|left|Press photo that was re-[[twitter|tweeted]] by journalists on 2 September 2015&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/LizSly/status/639042438984699904 (re-)Tweet] by Twitter user [[Liz Sly]] on 2 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;]]
She said that she felt "petrified" upon seeing the corpse of the toddler. Then she took the pictures to share her feelings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/photographer-of-the-world-shaking-picture-of-drowned-syrian-toddler-i-was-petrified-at-that-moment.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=87951&amp;NewsCatID=341 "Photographer of the world-shaking picture of drowned Syrian toddler: 'I was petrified at that moment'".] [[Hürriyet Daily News]]. 3 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Katz (3 September 2015).

Demir's photograph of Kurdi has been compared with iconic photos that changed the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McMah|first1=Lauren|title=Stories behind iconic photos that changed the world|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/stories-behind-iconic-photos-that-changed-the-world/story-fnki1jcy-1227526330325|work=news.com.au|date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her photograph accompanied by [[hashtag]] "KiyiyaVuranInsanlik" (English: humanity washed ashore) became the top trending topic on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-turkey-idUSKCN0R20IJ20150902 Troubling image of drowned boy captivates, horrifies] on [[Reuters]],  2 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 her photograph was the subject of a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] documentary about iconic photos, and specifically why this photo was not selected for the [[World Press Photo]], though it had resulted in many different reactions across Europe that changed the attitude of many people about the European migrant crisis.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;[http://www.zininbibliotheek.nl/landelijke-content/agenda/literatuurplein/87028-argos-tv-medialogica-een-zee-van-beelden Een Zee van Beelden] (English: A Sea of Images), 09 maart 2016, by Misja Pekel and Maud van de Reijt, Argos TV - Medialogica&lt;/ref&gt; The winning World Press photo of 2015 showed a child migrant that successfully crossed into Europe and thus communicated hope rather than despair.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

==Other photos by Demir of the dead toddler==
Demir took a series of photos, though it was the one initially retweeted on Twitter that is considered to have had the most international impact.&lt;ref name=Sheffield&gt;[https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/aylan-kurdi-social-media-report-1.533951 Analysis of the viral impact of the photo of Aylan Kurdi on Social Media] by researchers led by Dr Farida Vis of University of Sheffield’s Visual Social Media Lab, 14 December 2015 (retrieved 13 March 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the image chosen by Dutch newspaper [[Trouw]] for their front page on 3 September 2015 after a female journalist published it on their website in the evening of 2 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4496/Buitenland/article/detail/4134438/2015/09/02/De-aangespoelde-peuter-die-de-wereld-deed-beseffen.dhtml De aangespoelde peuter die de wereld schokte] website article by Nienke Schipper, 2 September 2015, Trouw&lt;/ref&gt; Though the initially retweeted image carried the highest emotional impact, the one most commonly chosen became a photo of the toddler seen from the side, with an aid worker approaching from the right.&lt;ref name=Sheffield/&gt;

===Photo of Alan Kurdi in the arms of an aid worker===
Other news agencies decided to select other photos of the same dead toddler with a rescue worker in the image, such as one with the lifeless corpse in the arms of an aid worker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeslive.co.za/world/2016/09/07/Remember-toddler-Aylan-Kurdi-UNICEF-chief-says-ahead-of-refugee-summits Remember toddler Aylan Kurdi, UNICEF chief says ahead of refugee summits] 7 September 2016 article in the [[The Times (South Africa)|Times]] quoting [[Anthony Lake]]'s comments on the eve of [[Seventy-first session of the United Nations General Assembly|UN summit]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art inspired by Demir's photos==
The photo of Alan Kurdi seen from the side, which partially shows the child's face, was re-used later on 6 January 2016 for a comic by [[Charlie Hebdo]] referring to the [[New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany]] for their anniversary edition commemorating the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]], which sparked a "racism debate".&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/sunny_hundal/status/687307040243511296 Charlie Hebdo comic on Twitter] posted with translation of caption by journalist [[Sunny Hundal]], 13 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/14/charlie-hebdo-cartoon-depicting-drowned-child-alan-kurdi-sparks-racism-debate Charlie Hebdo cartoon depicting drowned child Alan Kurdi sparks racism debate], article in [[The Guardian]] 14 January 2016 in reaction to Sunny Hundal's tweet&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month Chinese artist [[Ai Weiwei]] posed on the beach in a recreation of the position of the toddler's corpse at the time of the photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/01/ai-weiwei-poses-as-drowned-syrian-infant-refugee-in-haunting-photo Ai Weiwei poses as drowned Syrian infant refugee in 'haunting' photo], 1 February 2016, The Guardian (retrieved 9 July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 graffiti artists in Germany made an artistic political statement across from the headquarters of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) titled "Europa tot - Der Tod und das Geld", following these political artworks in January.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hessenschau.de/kultur/riesen-graffiti-in-frankfurt-zeigt-toten-fluechtlingsjungen,aylan-graffiti-102.html Riesen-Graffiti zeigt toten Flüchtlingsjungen], Hessenschau.de, 10 March 2016 (retrieved 9 July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies''''' is a 1984 book by Yale sociologist [[Charles Perrow]], which provides a detailed analysis of complex systems  from a sociological perspective. It was the first to "propose a framework for characterizing complex technological systems such as air traffic, marine traffic, chemical plants, dams, and especially [[nuclear power plant]]s according to their riskiness". Perrow argues that multiple and unexpected failures are built into society's complex and tightly coupled systems. Such accidents are unavoidable and cannot be designed around.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt;

Perrow's argument, based on systemic features and human error, is that big accidents tend to escalate, and technology is not the problem, the organizations are. Each of these principles is still relevant today.&lt;ref name=rev&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esd.mit.edu/WPS/wplit-2003-01.pdf |title=Normal Accidents by Charles Perrow |author=Daniel E Whitney  |year=2003 |work=Massachusetts Institute of Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meltdown: Why Our Systems Fail and What We Can Do About It|last=Clearfield|first=Chris|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2018|isbn=9780735222632|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System accidents==
{{details|System accident}}
"Normal" accidents, or system accidents, are so-called by Perrow because such accidents are inevitable in extremely complex systems. Given the characteristic of the system involved, multiple failures which interact with each other will occur, despite efforts to avoid them. Perrow said that [[operator error]] is a very common problem, many failures relate to organizations rather than technology, and big accidents almost always have very small beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;Perrow, Charles. ''Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies'' New York: Basic Books, 1984. p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Such events appear trivial to begin with before unpredictably cascading through the system to create a large event with severe consequences.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Normal Accidents'' contributed key concepts to a set of intellectual developments in the 1980s that revolutionized the conception of safety and risk. It made the case for examining technological failures as the product of highly interacting systems, and highlighted organizational and management factors as the main causes of failures. Technological disasters could no longer be ascribed to isolated equipment malfunction, operator error or acts of God.&lt;ref name=nature477/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perrow identifies three conditions that make a system likely to be susceptible to Normal Accidents. These are:
* The system is '''complex'''
* The system is '''tightly coupled'''
* The system has '''catastrophic potential'''

==Three Mile Island==
The inspiration for Perrow's books was the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]], where a [[nuclear accident]] resulted from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The event was an example of a normal accident because it was "unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable".&lt;ref&gt;Perrow, C. (1982), "The President’s Commission and the Normal Accident", in Sils, D., Wolf, C. and Shelanski, V. (Eds), ''Accident at Three Mile Island: The Human Dimensions'', Westview, Boulder, pp.173–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perrow concluded that the failure at Three Mile Island was a consequence of the system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. Therefore, he suggested, we might do better to contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely.&lt;ref name=nature477&gt;{{cite web |title=In retrospect:Normal accidents |author=Nick Pidgeon |date=22 September 2011 Vol 477 |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==New reactor designs==
One disadvantage of any new nuclear reactor technology is that safety risks may be greater initially as reactor operators have little experience with the new design.  Nuclear engineer [[David Lochbaum]] has explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents have occurred with what was at the time the most recent technology. He argues that "the problem with new reactors and accidents is twofold: scenarios arise that are impossible to plan for in simulations; and humans make mistakes".&lt;ref name=safe/&gt; As one director of a U.S. research laboratory put it, "fabrication, construction, operation, and maintenance of new reactors will face a steep learning curve: advanced technologies will have a heightened risk of accidents and mistakes. The technology may be proven, but people are not".&lt;ref name=safe&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. ''A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia, ''Journal of Contemporary Asia'', Vol. 40, No. 3, August 2010, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, [[Redundancy (engineering)|engineering redundancies]] which are put in place to help ensure safety, may backfire and produce less, not more reliability. This may happen in three ways: First, redundant safety devices result in a more complex system, more prone to errors and accidents. Second, redundancy may lead to shirking of responsibility among workers. Third, redundancy may lead to increased production pressures, resulting in a system that operates at higher speeds, but less safely.&lt;ref name=perr2004&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20276/sagan_oe_dec03.pdf |title=Learning from Normal Accidents |author=Scott D.

==Readership==
''Normal Accidents'' is a very widely cited book, with more than 1,000 citations in the [[Social Science Citation Index]] and [[Science Citation Index]] to 2003.&lt;ref name=perr2004/&gt; A German translation of the book was published in 1987 with a second edition in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;see data of the book in the German National Library http://d-nb.info/920805043&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that Operation Tovar had temporarily succeeded in cutting communication between Gameover ZeuS and its [[command-and-control server]]s.&lt;ref name=storm2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=krebs2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=DoJ2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/June/14-crm-584.html|title=U.S. Leads Multi-National Action Against "Gameover Zeus" Botnet and "Cryptolocker" Ransomware, Charges Botnet Administrator|date=2 June 2014|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminals attempted to send a copy of their database to a safe location, but it was intercepted by agencies already in control of part of the network. Russian [[Evgeniy Bogachev]], aka "lucky12345" and "slavik", was charged by the US FBI of being the ringleader of the gang behind Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker. The database indicates the scale of the attack, and it makes decryption of CryptoLocked files possible.

In August 2014 security firms involved in the shutdown, Fox-IT and [[FireEye]], created a portal, called Decrypt Cryptolocker,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.decryptcryptolocker.com Decrypt Cryptolocker Web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807142550/https://www.decryptcryptolocker.com/ |date=2014-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows any of the 500,000 victims to find the key to unlock their files. Victims need to submit an encrypted file without sensitive information, which allows the unlockers to deduce which encryption key was used. It is possible that not all CryptoLocked files can be decrypted, nor files encrypted by different ransomware.&lt;ref name=takedown&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28661463 BBC News: Cryptolocker victims to get files back for free, 6 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fireeye.com/blog/corporate/2014/08/your-locker-of-information-for-cryptolocker-decryption.html FireEye:Your Locker of Information for Cryptolocker Decryption, 6 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--refs for all August developments, as of 6Aug14--&gt;

Analysis of data which became available after the network was taken down indicated that about 1.3% of those infected had paid the ransom; many had been able to recover files which had been backed up, and others are believed to have lost huge amounts of data. Nonetheless, the gang was believed to have extorted about [[US$]]3m.&lt;ref name=takedown/&gt;

'''POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews''' ({{lang-pl|Muzeum Historii Żydów Polskich}}) is a museum on the site of the former [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''[[Polin]]'' in the museum's English name means either "[[Poland]]" or "rest here" and relates to a legend about the arrival of the first Jews to Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polin.pl/en/system/files/attachments/miniguide_en_0.pdf|title = A 1000-Year History of Polish Jews|publisher= POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews |date= |accessdate=2013-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building, a [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] structure in glass, copper, and concrete, was designed by Finnish architects [[Rainer Mahlamäki]] and Ilmari Lahdelma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/26/europe/EU-GEN-Poland-Jewish-Museum.php  Polish, Jewish leaders break ground on landmark Jewish museum]  The Associated Press, June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:2007 06 26 lech kaczynski 06.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[President of the Republic of Poland]], [[Lech Kaczynski]], at the groundbreaking ceremony for the POLIN Museum, 26 June 2007]]
The idea for creating a major new museum in [[Warsaw]] dedicated to the history of [[Polish Jews]] was initiated in 1995 by the Association of the [[Jewish Historical Institute]] of Poland.&lt;ref name="Goldmann"&gt;A.J. Goldmann, [http://forward.com/articles/173741/polish-museum-set-to-open-spectacular-window-on-je/?p=all#ixzz2hj3rUl32  "Polish Museum Set To Open Spectacular Window on Jewish Past"] The Jewish Daily Forward, April 01, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the [[Warsaw City Council]] allocated the land for this purpose in [[Muranów]], Warsaw’s prewar Jewish quarter and site of the former [[Warsaw Ghetto]], facing the Monument to the Warsaw Ghetto Heroes. In 2005, the Association of the Jewish Historical Institute of Poland established a private-public partnership with the [[Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage]] and the City of [[Warsaw]]. The Museum's first director was Jerzy Halbersztadt. In September 2006, a specially designed tent called Ohel (the Hebrew word for tent) was erected for exhibitions and events at site of the museum's future location.&lt;ref name="Goldmann"/&gt;

An international architectural competition to design the building was launched in 2005, supported by a grant from the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. On June 30, 2005, the winner was announced by the jury as the team of two Finnish architects, Rainer Mahlamäki and Ilmari Lahdelma.&lt;ref name="szrm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://szrm.pl/inwestycje/w-realizacji/muzeum-historii-zydow-polskich-3/ |title=Konkurs na projekt |publisher=Stołeczny Zarząd Rozbudowy Miasta |trans-title=Contest for the design of the Museum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016215018/http://szrm.pl/inwestycje/w-realizacji/muzeum-historii-zydow-polskich-3/ |archivedate=2013-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, 2009, construction of the building was officially inaugurated. The project was completed in 33 months at a cost of 150 million [[zloty]] allocated by the Ministry and the City, {{efn|The Association for the [[Jewish Historical Institute]] of Poland took responsibility for creating the Core Exhibition and raising the funds for it at a cost of about  120 million [[zloty]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mkidn.gov.pl/pages/posts/rozpoczeto_budowe_muzeum_historii_zydow_polskich-196.php  Rozpoczęto budowę Muzeum Historii Żydów Polskich.] ''Mkidn.gov.pl''.&lt;/ref&gt;}} with  a total cost of 320 million zloty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/Sejm7.nsf/biuletyn.xsp?skrnr=KSP-96 |title=Zapis przebiegu posiedzenia komisji |publisher=Sejm.gov.pl |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mkidn.gov.pl/media/docs/2013/20130416_mzhp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is financially supported by annual funds from the Polish Ministry of Culture and Warsaw City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fzp.net.pl/wiadomosci/polska/muzeum-historii-zydow-polskich-stara-sie-o-zwiekszenie-budzetu-na-przyszly-rok.|title=Wiadomości|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building opened and the museum began its educational and cultural programs on April 19, 2013, on the 70th Anniversary of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. During the 18 months that followed, more than 180,000 visitors toured the building, visited the first temporary exhibitions, and took part in cultural and educational programs and events, including film screenings, debates, workshops, performances, concerts, and lectures. The Grand Opening, with the completed Core Exhibition, took place on October 28, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://warszawa.gazeta.pl/warszawa/1,34862,15317631,Znamy_date_otwarcia_wystawy_Muzeum_Historii_Zydow.html#TRLokWarsTxt  Znamy datę otwarcia wystawy Muzeum Historii Żydów Polskich]  22 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Core Exhibition documents and celebrates the thousand-year history of the Jewish community in Poland that was decimated by the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=About/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP1/&gt;

In 2016 the museum won the [[European Museum of the Year Award]] from the [[European Museum Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Polish Jewry museum wins European Museum of the Year Award|url=http://www.jta.org/2016/04/10/news-opinion/world/polish-jewry-museum-wins-european-museum-of-the-year-award|accessdate=11 April 2016|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==

The Museum faces the memorial commemorating the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943. The winner of the architectural competition was [[Rainer Mahlamäki]], of the architectural studio 'Lahdelma &amp; Mahlamäki Oy in Helsinki, whose design was chosen from 100 submissions to the international architectural competition. The Polish firm Kuryłowicz &amp; Associates was responsible for construction. The building's minimalist exterior is clad with glass fins and copper mesh. Silk screened on the glass is the word ''Polin'', in Latin and Hebrew letters.

[[File:Museum of the History of Polish Jews facade closeup 2013.jpg|thumb|Hebrew and Latin letters of the word Polin]]

The central feature of the building is its cavernous entrance hall. The main hall forms a high, undulating wall. The empty space is a symbol of cracks in the history of Polish Jews. Similar in shape to gorge, which could be a reference to the crossing of the Red Sea known from the Exodus. The museum is nearly 13,000 square meters of usable space. At the lowest level, in the basement of the building will be placed a main exhibition about history of Jews from the Middle Ages to modern times. The museum building also has a multipurpose auditorium with 480 seats, temporary exhibition rooms, education center, information center, play room for children, café, shop, and in the future kosher restaurant.

Since the museum presents the whole history of Jews in Poland, not only the period under [[Nazi occupation of Poland|German occupation]], the designer wanted to avoid similarities to existing Holocaust museums (such as the [[Jewish Museum, Berlin|Jewish Museum in Berlin]] and the museum at [[Yad Vashem]]) which had austere concrete structures. The architects kept the museum in the colors of sand, giving it a more approachable feeling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dezeen.com/2013/10/03/museum-of-the-history-of-polish-jews-by-lahdelma-mahlamaki-architects/  Museum of the History of Polish Jews by Lahdelma &amp; Mahlamäki] Dezeen Magazine, 3 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the design of the museum was awarded the Chicago Athenaeum International Architecture Award.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20131014160448/http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/intarch/2008/  International Architecture Awards: 2008 Winners] The Chicago Athenaeum.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the designer Rainer Mahlamäki was awarded the Finlandia Prize for Architecture for his design of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/a1305894111681 | title = Arkkitehtuurin ensimmäinen Finlandia-palkinto: Rainer Mahlamäen puolanjuutalaisen historian museo Varsovassa | date = 4 Nov 2014 | publisher = Helsingin Sanomat | accessdate = 5 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizational structure ==
The Core Exhibition's academic team consists of [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] (Program Director) of [[New York University]], Hanna Zaremska of the Institute of History of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], Adam Teller of [[Brown University]], Igor Kąkolewski of the [[University of Warmia and Mazury]], Marcin Wodziński of the [[University of Wrocław]], [[Samuel Kassow]] of [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], [[Barbara Engelking]] and Jacek Leociak of the [[Polish Center for Holocaust Research]] at the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], Helena Datner of the [[Jewish Historical Institute]], and Stanisław Krajewski of [[Warsaw University]].

American Friends of POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews is a U.S. based non-profit organization supporting the foundation of the Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhpjnac.org|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 2009 the museum launched the [[Virtual Shtetl]] portal, which collects and provides access to essential information about Jewish life in Poland before and after [[the Holocaust in Poland]]. The portal now features more than 1,240 towns with maps, statistics, and image galleries based in large measure on material provided by local history enthusiasts and former residents of those places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/?cid=15&amp;lang=en_GB|title=Wirtualny Sztetl - Muzeum Historii Żydów Polskich POLIN|website=www.sztetl.org.pl|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Core exhibition ==
The core exhibition occupies more than {{convert|4000|m2}} of space.  It consists of eight galleries that document and celebrate the thousand-year history of the Jewish community in Poland  – once the largest Jewish community in the world – that was almost entirely destroyed during the Holocaust. The exhibition includes a multimedia narrative with interactive installations, paintings and oral histories, among other features created by more than 120 scholars and curators. One item is a replica of the roof and ceiling of a 17th-century Gwoździec synagogue.&lt;ref name=AP1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Core&gt;[http://www.polin.pl/en/exhibitions/core-exhibition-grand-opening-october-28-2014 "Core Exhibition"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210010803/http://www.polin.pl/en/exhibitions/core-exhibition-grand-opening-october-28-2014 |date=2014-12-10 }}, POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews, accessed December 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Galleries ==
===Forest=== 
This gallery tells the tale of how, fleeing from persecution in Western Europe, the Jews came to Poland. Over the next thousand years, the country would become the largest European home for the Jewish community.

===First Encounters (10th century-1507)=== 
This gallery is devoted to the first Jewish settlers in Poland. Visitors meet [[Abraham ben Jacob|Ibrahim ibn Jakub]], a Jewish diplomat from Cordoba, author of famous notes from a trip to Europe. One of the most interesting objects presented in the gallery is the first sentence written in Yiddish in the prayer book of 1272.

===Paradisus Iudaeorum (1569-1648)=== 
{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
This gallery presents how the Jewish community was organized and what role Jews played in the country’s economy. One of the most important elements in this gallery is an interactive model of [[Kraków]] and Jewish [[Kazimierz]], showing the rich culture of the local Jewish community. Visitors learn that religious tolerance in Poland made it a "[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|Paradisus Iudaeorum]]" (Jewish paradise). This golden age of the Jewish community in Poland ended with pogroms during the [[Khmelnitsky Uprising]]. This event is commemorated by a symbolic fire gall leading to the next gallery.

The title of the gallery has been subject to some criticism and debate among scholars due to the antisemitic roots of the proverb it is taken from, a 17th century condemnation of the "rampant prevalence of the infidels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tokarska-Bakir |first1=Joanna |title=POLIN: 'Ultimate Lost Object' |publisher=Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://culture.pl/en/article/a-virtual-visit-to-the-museum-of-the-history-of-polish-jews|title=A Virtual Visit to the Museum of the History of Polish Jews|work=Culture.pl|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kijek|first=Kamil|date=2017|title=For whom and about what?

===The Jewish Town (1648-1772)===
This gallery presents the history of Polish Jews until the period of the [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]]. It is shown by an example of a typical borderland town where Jews constituted a significant part of the population. The most important part of this gallery is a unique reconstruction of the roof and ceiling of Gwoździec, a [[Hvisdets Synagogue|wooden synagogue]] that was located in pre-war [[Poland]].

===Encounters with Modernity (1772-1914)===
This gallery presents the time of the partitions when Jews shared the fate of Polish society divided between Austria, Prussia and Russia. The exhibition includes the role played by Jewish entrepreneurs, such as [[Izrael Poznański|Izrael Kalmanowicz Poznański]], in the industrial revolution in Polish lands. Visitors also learn about changes in traditional Jewish rituals and other areas of life, and the emergence of new social movements, religious and political. This period is also marked by the emergence of modern [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]], which Polish Jews had to face.

===On the Jewish Street (1914-1939)===
This gallery is devoted to the period of the [[Second Polish Republic]], which is seen – despite the challenges that the young country had to face – as a second golden age in the history of Polish Jews. A graphic timeline is presented, indicating many of the most important political events of the interwar period. The exhibition also highlights Jewish film, theater, and literature.

===Holocaust (1939-1944)===
This gallery shows the tragedy of the Holocaust during the German occupation of Poland, which resulted in the deaths of approximately 90 percent of the 3.3 million Polish Jews. Visitors are shown the history of the Warsaw Ghetto and introduced to [[Emanuel Ringelblum]] and the clandestine group of volunteers that went by the code name [[Oyneg Shabbos]], who collected documents and solicited testimonies and reports chronicling life in the Ghetto during the Nazi occupation. The gallery also portrays the horrors experienced by the non-Jewish population of Poland during [[World War II]] as well as their reactions and responses to the extermination of Jews.

===Postwar Years (1944-present)===
The last gallery shows the period after 1945, when most of the survivors of the Holocaust emigrated for various reasons, including the post-war takeover of Poland by the Soviets, the hostility of some portion on the Polish populace, and the state-sponsored anti-Semitic campaign conducted by the communist authorities in 1968. An important date is the year 1989, marking [[Revolutions of 1989|the end of Soviet domination]], followed by the revival of a small but dynamic Jewish community in Poland.

The exhibition was developed by an international team of scholars and museum professionals from Poland, the United States and Israel, in conjunction with the Museum’s curatorial team under the direction of Prof. [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]].&lt;ref name=Core/&gt;

The '''Paley Center for Media''', formerly the '''Museum of Television &amp; Radio''' ('''MT&amp;R''') and the '''Museum of Broadcasting''', founded in 1975 by [[William S. Paley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paleycenter.org/about-mission-history-history/ "History"] Paley Center for Media website&lt;/ref&gt; is an American cultural institution in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Los Angeles]] dedicated to the discussion of the cultural, creative, and social significance of television, radio, and emerging platforms for the professional community and media-interested public.

It was renamed The Paley Center for Media on June 5, 2007, to encompass emerging broadcasting technologies such as the [[Internet]], [[mobile video]], and [[podcasting]], as well as to expand its role as a neutral setting where media professionals can engage in discussion and debate about the evolving media landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtr.inet7.com/PressRoom/pressRelease/060507.htm "The Museum of Television &amp; Radio announces new name"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609200514/http://mtr.inet7.com/PressRoom/pressRelease/060507.htm |date=2007-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
With an ever-growing collection of content [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] on [[radio]] and [[television]], the Paley Center has two branches; in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. The New York City branch is in the heart of [[Midtown Manhattan]] at 25 West [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] between [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|5th]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|6th Avenues]]. The Los Angeles branch is located at 465 N [[Beverly Drive]] in [[Beverly Hills]], near [[Rodeo Drive]].

===New York===
The original Museum of Broadcasting, founded in 1975 by William S. Paley, opened in Manhattan on November 9, 1976, occupying two floors in an office building at 1 East 53rd Street, near the corner of 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue. This was adjacent to the Doubleday Book Store on Fifth Avenue.

The Museum of Broadcasting's name was changed to The Museum of Television &amp; Radio with the September 12, 1991 move into the William S. Paley Building. Designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and located at 25 West 52nd Street (adjacent to the famed [[21 Club]] at 21 West 52nd Street), the 16-story building was itself renamed The Paley Center for Media in 2007. It has two front entrances: the one on the left is for office staff, and the main entrance on the right for the general public. The [[Alexander Mackendrick]] film ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957) has an exterior location scene with different angles revealing how the neighborhood looked in the years before the building was constructed.

The ground-level floor of the New York museum features the ticket and information area and the [[Steven Spielberg]] Gallery, used for exhibitions, receptions and fund-raising events. Reservations to use the Library are made at the front desk. In addition to the elevator, a staircase on the first floor leads down to the large basement-level theater. The fourth floor has numerous computers, used by visitors to locate programming in the collection. When a selection is made, it can be watched on the computer.  Computers are available both for individuals and for groups.

===Los Angeles===
The Museum of Television &amp; Radio in Los Angeles at 465 North Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills, opened March 18, 1996 in a new building designed by [[Richard Meier]] and named for [[Leonard H. Goldenson]]. When the Los Angeles building opened, it featured a collection duplicated from the tapes in the New York collection. Rooms are named for the celebrity sponsors: the [[Danny Thomas]] Lobby, the [[Aaron Spelling]] Reception Area and the [[Garry Marshall]] Pool. Screenings are held in the 150-seat [[John H. Mitchell]] Theatre. The Ahmanson Radio Listening Room has headphones for use with five pre-programmed channels.

==Archives==
The Paley Center for Media is committed to the idea that many television and radio programs are significant works and should be preserved for posterity's sake. Instead of collecting [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and [[memorabilia]], the Paley Center comprises mostly screening rooms, including two full-sized theaters. Nearly 160,000 television shows, commercials, and radio programs are available in the Paley Center's library, and during each visit, viewers can select and watch shows at individual consoles, and radio programs are accessed through these same consoles.

Some television programs are from the 1940s with radio programs dating back to the 1920s. The earliest TV program in the Museum's collection is a silent film of NBC's 1939 production of [[Dion Boucicault]]'s melodrama ''The Streets of New York'' (1857), with [[Norman Lloyd (actor)|Norman Lloyd]], [[George Coulouris]], and [[Jennifer Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, Michael. (1994) ''Please Stand By''. Overlook Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum does not sell the material or permit it to leave the premises. Viewing copies of television programs are [[8 mm video format|Hi-8mm video tape]] dubs. The originals are kept in a vault outside of New York City, and the collection is being digitized.&lt;ref&gt;Jenson, Elizabeth. (June 5, 2007) [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/arts/design/05pale.html?ex=1338696000&amp;en=40d8832d1846f00c&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss/ "New Name and Mission for Museum of Television"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Paley Center has acquired many lost episodes of classic television shows and has produced [[Documentary film|documentary]] features about the history and impact of television and radio. In recent years, the Center has sponsored advance viewing of the [[pilot episodes]] of each network's new programs.

Television and radio shows are added to the collection after archival discoveries and through donations from individuals and organizations. In 2002, the Museum held a showing of the previously unseen rehearsal film of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]'' telecast from March 17, 1957.  This rehearsal was found in the [[CBS]] vault while the Museum was on a quest for other "lost" ''Cinderella'' materials. It had been believed that on the night of the live broadcast the show was preserved on both [[kinescope]] and [[videotape]] and then transmitted to the West Coast. Seeking either of these, Jane Klain, the Director of Research at the New York facility, asked CBS to search their vaults. The CBS database listed three 16mm films featuring five-minute segments of [[Julie Andrews]] performing in the show. When the earliest one was brought from the CBS vault, it was discovered to be the full dress rehearsal.

The Center is also known for its many discoveries involving daytime [[game show]]s. Episodes of [[wiping|destroyed]] shows such as ''[[High Rollers]]'', ''[[Celebrity Sweepstakes]]'', ''[[The Money Maze]]'', the [[Chuck Woolery]] version of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US daytime game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[To Say the Least]]'', and daytime ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' episodes are all available for viewing in the library. Episodes of other game shows such as ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', and ''[[The Gong Show]]'' are also in the library.

==Programming and education==
Seminars and interviews with public figures are conducted frequently, all of which are recorded and available for later viewing on individual consoles. Past seminar participants have included [[Lucille Ball]], [[Carol Burnett]], [[Dick Cavett]], [[Alan Alda]], [[Al Franken]], [[John Frankenheimer]], [[James Garner]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Roy Huggins]], [[Jack Paar]], [[Dennis Potter]], [[Dick Van Dyke]], and [[Gore Vidal]]. Also available for viewing are seminars featuring creators and cast members from TV shows, including ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', and ''[[The League]]''. Panel discussions have varied from what it was like to work with [[Orson Welles]] to a celebration of [[Roy Huggins]]'s career.

PaleyFest, also known as the William S. Paley Television Festival, is an annual television festival hosted by the Paley Center in the Los Angeles area. Founded in 1984, the festival, held annually in the spring, features panels composed of the casts and prominent creative talent from popular television shows such as ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'', ''[[Parks and Recreation (TV series)|Parks and Recreation]]'', ''[[Mad Men]]'', and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', among many others. The panels field questions from a moderator and a public audience and often present exclusive content from their respective series. The festival has been in many venues over its history, including the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] Bing Theater, the [[Directors Guild of America]] theater, the [[Cinerama Dome]], and the [[Saban Theatre]] in Beverly Hills. It was relocated to the larger [[Dolby Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ng|first=Philiana|title=PaleyFest Moves to Dolby Theatre for 2014, Unveils First Honorees|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/paleyfest-2014-pretty-little-liars-666232|website=Hollywood Reporter|date=December 12, 2013 |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media Advanced Management Program===
In 2010, The Paley Center for Media announced a partnership with [[IESE Business School]] to offer the Advanced Management Program in Media and Entertainment or the "Media AMP", a postgraduate level program for media and entertainment executives to preparing them for high level leadership roles in their companies.  Launched in January 2011, the program’s goal is to bring executives up to speed on new business models, management techniques, and technologies. A key feature is access to leaders in the industry.

The Media AMP curriculum covers four modules over a six-month period. Three of the modules are held in New York, and one in Los Angeles. Key discussion topics include:  Value Creation; Digital Strategy; Accounting, Finance and Management Control; Content and Customers; Leadership; Production, Technology and Operations Management; Entrepreneurship and Innovation; IT Systems and Strategy; Managerial Economics and Decision Analysis; Marketing Strategy; and others.

[[Image:Greek vase with runners at the panathenaic games 530 bC.jpg|thumb|Greek vase depicting runners at the Panathenaic Games c. 530 BC]]

The '''Panathenaic Games''' ({{lang-grc|Παναθήναια}}) were held every four years in [[Athens]] in [[Ancient Greece]] from 566 BC&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of the Olympic Games by David C. Young, Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-1129-4}}, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; to the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Heuck Allen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rV8vyYn-qMgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39 Finding the walls of Troy: Frank Calvert and Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarlík], University of California Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-520-20868-4}}, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; These Games incorporated religious festival, ceremony (including prize-giving), athletic competitions, and cultural events hosted within a [[stadium]].

==Religious festival==

The competitions for which this festival came to be known were only part of a much larger religious occasion; the Great Panathenaia itself. These ritual observances consisted of numerous sacrifices to Athena (the name-sake of the event and patron deity to the hosts of the event - Athens) as well as Poseidon and others. The Panathenaic festival was formed in order to honor the goddess Athena who had become the patron of Athens after having a competition with the god Poseidon where they were to win the favor of the Athenian people by offering the people gifts. The festival would also bring unity among the people of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waldstein|first1=Charles|title=The Panathenaic Festival and the Central Slab of the Parthenon Frieze|journal=The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts|date=1885|volume=1|issue=1|pages=10–17|doi=10.2307/495977|ref=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sister-event to the Great Panathenaia was held every year - the Lesser Panathenaia, which was 3–4 days shorter in celebration. The competitions were the most prestigious games for the citizens of [[Athens]], but not as important as the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] or the other [[Panhellenic Games]].

==Ceremony==

The procession to the [[Parthenon]] was more important than the games themselves. During the Great Panathenaia, a special robe (the ''[[peplos]]'') was made by the women of Athens for the statue of [[Athena]], which was carried to the Parthenon as part of the procession. There was also a large sacrifice made to Athena, the ''hekatombe'' ("sacrifice of a hundred oxen") and the meat from the sacrificed animals was used in an enormous banquet on the final night of the festival, the ''pannychis'' (Greek παννυχίς, "all-nighter").  Many scholars believe that this procession is the theme of the inner Ionic [[Parthenon Frieze]], highlighting its importance to the Athenian people to warrant inclusion in a temple.

Award ceremonies included the giving of [[Panathenaic amphora]]e which were the large ceramic vessels that contained the oil given as prizes.  The winner of the [[chariot race]] received as a prize one-hundred and forty Panathenaic amphorae full of olive oil.

== Cultural events ==

The Panathenaia also included poetic and musical competitions.  Prizes were awarded for [[rhapsode|rhapsodic]] recitation of [[Homer]]ic poetry, for instrumental music on the [[aulos|aulus]] and [[cithara]], and for singing to the accompaniment of the aulus and cithara ([[citharede|citharody]]). In addition, the Games included a reading of both the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the ''[[Iliad]]''.

==The Panathenaic Stadium==

The athletic events were staged at the [[Panathenaic Stadium]], which is still in use today. In 1865, [[Evangelis Zappas]] left a vast fortune in his will with instructions to excavate and refurbish the ancient Panathenaic stadium so that modern Olympic Games could be held every four years "in the manner of our ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C. Young, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The Panathenaic stadium has hosted Zappas Olympics in [[Zappas Olympics#Games of 1870|1870]],&lt;ref&gt;The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C. Young, Chapters 4 &amp; 13&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zappas Olympics#Games of 1875|1875]], as well as the modern [[Olympic Games]] in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]. The stadium also hosted the [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906]] [[Intercalated Games]].

== Contests ==
The Panathenaic Games held contests in a number of musical, athletic, and equestrian events. Due to the fact that there were so many contests held, the games usually lasted a little over a week. On a fourth century marble block, experts explain that on the block is written a program for the games, as well as individual events and their prizes. The inscription also says that there are two age categories for the music events but three age categories for the athletic events. According to scholars, the age groups are boys: 12-16; beardless youths: 16-20; men: over 20.&lt;ref name=Neils&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neils|first1=Jennifer|title=Goddess and Polis: The Panathenanic Festival In Ancient Athens|date=1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One thing that was different about these games than normal funeral games is that prizes were given to runners-up, not just the lone victor.

Using the inscription, experts put together a general program like so: Day 1: Musical and Rhapsodic Contest; Day 2: Athletic Contest for Boys and Youths; Day 3: Athletic Contest for Men; Day 4: Equestrian Contest; Day 5: Tribal Contest; Day 6: Torch Race and Sacrifice; Day 7: Boat Race; Day 8: Awarding of Prizes, Feasting and Celebrations.&lt;ref name=Neils/&gt; Experts reasonably came up with how the games went based on the order of prizes which were written on the marble block. Wrestling was also a part of the contest as well as discus.

The musical events which took place were Kithara players, Flute players, and singers. The athletic events were the stadion, pentathlon, wrestling, boxing, and pankration. The equestrian events were two-horse chariot race, horse race, and javelin throw on horseback. Based on the inscription, we learn that the prizes given to the men and the youth were different. Men were rewarded a certain amount of drachmas and/or a valuable crown worth a certain amount of drachmas. Boys and youths were given a certain number of amphoras of olive oil.&lt;ref name=Neils /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4250">The '''post-Napoleonic depression''' was an [[depression (economics)|economic depression]] in Europe after the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]].

In [[England]], an agricultural depression led to the passage of the [[Corn Laws]] (which were to polarize British politics for the next three decades), and placed great strain on the system of [[English Poor Laws|poor relief inherited from Elizabethan times]].&lt;ref&gt;Lord Ernle, ''English Farming Past and Present''. Fifth Edition. (London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., Ltd. 1936), [http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/010136ernle/010136ch15.htm Chapter XV: Agricultural Depression and the Poor Law 1813-37]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815, a brief boom in [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile manufacture]] in England was followed by periods of chronic industrial economic depression, particularly among textile weavers and spinners (the textile trade was concentrated in Lancashire).&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |last=Frangopulo |first=N.

At the same time, the [[Corn Laws]] (the first of which was passed in 1815) exacerbated the situation. They imposed a [[tariff]] on foreign grain in an effort to [[Protectionism|protect]] English grain producers (agricultural landowners). The cost of food for working people rose as people were forced to buy the more expensive and lower quality British grain, and periods of famine and chronic unemployment ensued, increasing the desire for political reform both in Lancashire and in the country at large.&lt;ref name="County of Lancs: Manchester"&gt;{{cite book |author=Farrer, William |author2=Brownbill, John |title=The Victoria history of the county of Lancaster. – Lancashire.

In [[Scotland]], the depression ended in 1822.&lt;ref name="Saville1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Saville|title=Bank of Scotland: a history, 1695-1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USQkqlHTfnAC&amp;pg=PA484|accessdate=9 March 2011|year=1996|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-0757-0|page=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Jackson of Pennsylvania theorised that the [[Panic of 1819]] and resulting depression in the United States were caused by the post-Napoleonic depression, holding that the end of the Napoleonic wars had led to the collapse of export markets and resulting [[underconsumption]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard, ''The Panic Of 1819: Reactions and Policies'', p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

It takes place at the town of Reading in [[Berkshire]] on the [[River Thames]] in southern [[England]], near the [[Thames Valley Park]] business park on the south side of the river. A more local [[Thames Valley Park Regatta]] takes place at the same location.

The '''Reading Working Men’s Regatta''' was established in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtr-tvp.co.uk/history.htm History], [http://www.rtr-tvp.co.uk/ Reading Town Regatta &amp; Thames Valley Park Regatta], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; It was promoted by the Mayor and Corporation of Reading, receiving Royal patronage in 1896. The present title of the event was adopted in 1966.

The 2007 regatta took place on Saturday 30 June and the 2010 regatta on Saturday 26.

'''Russell Stephen King''' (born 1958 or 1959&lt;!--[[MOS:APPROXDATE]]{{birth based on age as of date|52|2011|4|19}}--&gt;) is a convicted [[fraud]]ster. He headed negotiations and acted as consultant for the doomed purchase of [[Notts County Football Club]] by Munto Finance, a subsidiary of [[Qadbak Investments]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13109493 | work=BBC News | title=Fraud office looks at scamming of Sven-Goran Eriksson | date=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For years King remained a fugitive living in [[Bahrain]] continuing fraudulent activities there.

In July 2018, after extradition to [[Jersey]], he was charged in the [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Jersey Royal Court]] with 25 counts of fraud and larceny. He remains there in custody, ordered to reappear in the same court on August 3, 2018.

==Background==
King is {{Age as of date|52|2011|4|19}} years old.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1378146/Sven-Goran-Eriksson-duped-managing-football-minnows-Russell-King.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Sven-Goran Eriksson 'duped into managing football minnows by businessman who promised billions in incredible fraud'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a former resident of [[Jersey]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/04/18/jersey-links-in-bbcs-fraud-investigation/ Jersey links in BBC’s fraud investigation » News » This Is Jersey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance fraud==
In 1991, King was sentenced to two years in prison for [[insurance fraud]] after trying to claim £600,000 for his [[Aston Martin]] after claiming it had been stolen. It was discovered that he had hidden it in his garage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Notts County F.C. purchase==
King acted as head negotiator and consultant for the purchase of [[Notts County Football Club]] to Munto Finance, a subsidiary of Qadbak Investments,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; making the false claim that he was a manager of billions of US dollars of the [[Bahraini royal family]]'s money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/bahrain-probe-deals-of-convicted-uk-fraudster-395224.html |title=Bahrain to probe deals of convicted UK fraudster - Banking &amp; Finance |publisher=ArabianBusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gus Lubin |url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-04-21/wall_street/30008468_1_bahraini-con-man-house-arrest |title=Meet The Conman Who Bought A Football Club And All The Gold In North Korea, While Name-Dropping The King Of Bahrain - Business Insider |publisher=Articles.businessinsider.com |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts |first=Laura |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8457156/Conman-took-control-of-half-an-investment-bank-without-paying.html |title=Conman took control of half an investment bank without paying |publisher=Telegraph |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2013-07-12 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although claiming to have had no legal involvement in the scheme, King was able to negotiate the sale of the football club for 1 pound. He also recruited former England football manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] to join promising him a large sum if he also worked for Swiss Commodity Holding (SCH). King claimed the mining company had raw material assets worth $1.97 trillion (£1.27 trillion).&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; He used the nickname of L. Voldemort, after the [[Harry Potter]] character [[Lord Voldemort]], and then he told many times that he couldn't be involved because his name, Russell King, didn't appear in any documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= How Digger helped solve the riddle of Notts County and Lord Voldemort |author= Matt Scott |date= 15 April 2011 |work= The Guardian |url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/15/notts-county-digger-series |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was sold five months after the purchase with debts of £7 million.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==North Korea==
King, representing Swiss Commodity Holding (SCH), visited [[North Korea]]n Chairman [[Kim Yong-nam]] of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] in [[Pyongyang]]. Sven-Göran Eriksson joined King on the trip. The purpose of the visit was to persuade the government to hand over gold mining rights in exchange for billions of US dollars allegedly from Bahraini investors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Sauber==
[[Sauber]], seeking a new investor encountered Qadbak Investments. The deal collapsed as it was revealed that King was behind the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxist.com/tag/russell+king/|title=Luxury Photos and Articles - StyleList|work=StyleList|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2018 magazine scam==
Russell King  launched a magazine called ''FT Business Arabia'', claiming it to be the Middle East version of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in order to obtain millions of dollars in advertising revenue. He also benefited from barter deals with top hospitality groups and luxury retail brands in the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/xpress/news/trillion-dollar-conman-strikes-dubai-1.2173677|title=Trillion dollar conman strikes Dubai|last=Editor|first=Mazhar Farooqui,|date=2018-02-14|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
Jersey-based company Close Finance sought repayment of £2m in loans. This had resulted in a freeze of his assets up to that amount. King had been sought by the British police, the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]], the [[Financial Services Authority]], and [[Nottinghamshire Police]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Although denying any fraud, King remained a fugitive. He was currently living in [[Bahrain]] but was barred by Bahraini officials from leaving the country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/bahrain-probe-deals-of-convicted-uk-fraudster-395224.html|title=Bahrain to probe deals of convicted UK fraudster|work=Arabian Business|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since around 2013, King had been operating the Middle East edition of a magazine called ''Food and Travel'' using different aliases and claiming false statistics on the publication's circulation numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/xpress/news/trillion-dollar-conman-strikes-dubai-1.2173677|title=Trillion dollar conman strikes Dubai|last=Editor|first=Mazhar Farooqui,|date=2018-02-14|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July 2018, the Jersey Evening Post reported that King was remanded in custody on the island and expected to face 25 counts of fraud and larceny charges in the amount of £16m in early August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2018/07/28/extradited-defendant-faces-16m-fraud-case/|title=Extradited defendant faces £16m fraud case|last=Morris|first=Michael|website=jerseyeveningpost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2018 fraud and larceny charges==
On 27 July 2018, King was charged in the [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Jersey Royal Court]] with 25 counts of fraud and larceny that occurred while he was living in Jersey in 2008. These include allegedly selling the Belgravia Financial Services Group in a fraudulent manner, as well as falsification of accounts and larceny as well as forgery.

Crown Advocate Matthew Jowitt stated "It is alleged the misappropriation is something in the order of £16 million pounds."

On 7 August 2018, it was reported that due to the complexity of the case and the speed at which events had happened, the bailiff, Sir William Bailhache, adjourned the case for three weeks, at which point pleas would be entered.

King will be back in court on 24 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gdnonline.com/Details/385734/Conman-extradited-to-UK-to-stand-trial-on-25-fraud-and-larceny-counts|title=Bahrain News: Conman extradited to UK to stand trial on 25 fraud and larceny counts|website=www.gdnonline.com|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2018/07/28/extradited-defendant-faces-16m-fraud-case/|title=Extradited defendant faces £16m fraud case|last=Morris|first=Michael|website=jerseyeveningpost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soul Grand Prix''' initiated a new phase in [[Rio de Janeiro]] funk culture in 1975, a phase which celebrated [Blackness] and Black culture. Soul Grand Prix echoed the sounds of [[James Brown]], [[Kool and the Gang]] and [[Wilson Pickett]]. In order to have large dances, ''Soul Grand Prix'' would put together huge sound systems, sometimes using over a hundred speakers and generating crowds of over ten thousand of Brazil's youth. Soul Grand Prix dances used mixed media, films, photos, and posters to inculcate the "Black is beautiful" style period.&lt;ref&gt;Yudice, George. "The Funkication of Rio".  In Microphone Fiends, 193-220. London Routledge, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; This period influenced the funkeiro culture in [Brazil] who still today host huge parties to dance to today's funk and sample music from the past to create new modernized music.&lt;ref&gt;Ambassador.

==Haryali Teej==
Haryali Teej is celebrated on the third day of the bright half of the North Indian Lunar month of Shraavana.  As Shraavana (or Saawan) month falls during monsoon or rainy season when the surroundings become green, the Shraavana Teej is also called Hariyali Teej (Green Teej). A fast is kept and the focus is the moon.

The Hariyali Teej festival is also celebrated to remember the reunion of Lord [[Shiva]] and Goddess [[Parvati]], the day when Lord [[Shiva]] accepted Goddess [[Parvati]] as his wife. Goddess [[Parvati]]  fasted and was austere for many years and was accepted by Lord [[Shiva]] as his wife in her 108 birth.  Goddess [[Parvati]] is also known as Teej Mata.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P_BuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=teej+mata+parvati&amp;dq=teej+mata+parvati&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMI3dCJ382RxwIVCC_bCh39NQSa Knopf, 1996  Rajasthan]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Observance}}

The traditional areas of celebration are: [[Punjab region]] and [[Rajasthan]].

====Punjab region====
The festival is celebrated in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Haryana]] and [[Chandigarh]].
[[File:Giddha dance Teeyan Punjab Teej India 2.jpg|thumb|left|Giddha dance Teeyan Punjab]]

=====Punjab=====
Teej is known as ''[[teeyan]]'' in [[Punjab]] and is seen as a seasonal festival which is dedicated to the onset of the monsoon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C_lvAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=teeyan+punjab&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=onset+ Good Earth Punjab Travel Guide (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is celebrated by women of all faiths, and lasts from the third day of the bright half of the lunar month of Sawan as per the [[Punjabi calendar]] to the full moon of Sawan (about 13 days). Teeyan involves women getting together and performing [[Gidda]], married women visiting their families and receiving gifts. It is also traditional for women to ride on swings.

Fairs are organised in Schools and Colleges where dance competitions are held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2014/20140727/cth1.htm The Tribune 27 July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Haryana=====
[[File:Haryali Teej.jpg|thumb|220px|Haryali Teej is a festival when girls play on swings that are set up under trees or open courtyards  During Teej, in-laws, husbands and other family members give gifts, typically new clothes and accessories, to girls and women. Boys fly kites. prepare churma and sweets especially ghevar at their home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teejfestival.org/about-teej.html About Teej]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Haryali Teej'' is one of the famous festivals of [[Haryana]], and is celebrated as an official holiday. Many functions are organised by the [[Government of Haryana]] to celebrate this festival, which welcomes the [[rainy season]]. Boys traditionally flew [[kite]]s from morning to evening, though this tradition is losing its charm in big cities due to high rise buildings and lack of terrace space.

Swings are set up in open courtyards, under trees for the season. Girls apply [[henna]] to their hands and feet and are excused from household chores on this day. On Teej, girls often receive new clothes from their parents.

On Teej, just as on [[Karva Chauth]], the mother sends a ''baya'' or gift. The ''puja'' is performed in the morning. The ''baya'', which consists of a variety of foodstuffs, is placed on a ''[[thaali]]'' at a place of worship where a [[Courtyard|chowk]] (square) has been decorated, and an idol or picture of [[Parvati]] has been installed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haryanatimes.8m.com/news/teej.htm Haryana Times (22 01 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; The evenings are set aside for singing and dancing, including the women's prayers for their husbands' longevity and their families.

=====Chandigarh=====
[[Chandigarh administration]] makes special arrangements for Teej celebration in the Rock Garden in the city. School children present plays and other cultural programs on this day. The female members of the family, especially daughters, are given gifts and dresses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Traditional-Teej-at-Rock-Garden/articleshow/6302063.cms?referral=PM The Times of India 13 08 2010 Poonam Sharma]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

====Rajasthan====
Teej welcomes the monsoon and observed in the month of [[Shravan]] (July/August). The monsoon rains fall on the parched land and the pleasing scent of the wet soil rises into the air. Swings are hung from trees and women dressed in green clothes sing songs in celebration of the advent of the monsoon.&lt;ref name=mb63/&gt;

This festival is dedicated to the Goddess [[Parvati]], commemorating her union with Lord Shiva.&lt;ref name=mb63/&gt; Goddess Parvati is worshipped by seekers of conjugal bliss and happiness. An elaborate procession is taken out in [[Jaipur]]&lt;ref&gt;Rajasthan Patrika (14.08.2015) Tripolya bazaar ka khulega raasta, paramprik route se yaegi teej ki savari [http://rajasthanpatrika.patrika.com/story/rajasthan/tripolia-market-road-to-be-opened-for-teej-procession-1275938.html]&lt;/ref&gt; for two consecutive days on the festive occasion which is watched by people in large numbers. The Teej idol is covered with a canopy whereas the [[Gangaur]] idol is open. The traditional ''[[ghevar]]'' sweet is also associated with the festival.

During Teej, Goddess [[Parvati]] is worshipped. The day before Haryali Teej, is celebrated as ''Sinjara'', wherein women put [[mehandi]] on their hands and eat ''.''

Hartalika is a combination of "harit" and "aalika" which means "abduction" and "female friend" respectively. According to the legend of Hartalika Teej, Goddess [[Parvati]], incarnated as Goddess [[Shailaputri]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WZskCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=shailputri+himalaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMIyNGwoqSQxwIVzBfbCh0Pjwm5#v=onepage&amp;q=shailputri%20himalaya&amp;f=false Gautam,  Ahalya  (2015) Hindu Goddess Nav Durga Maa: Hindu religion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X5rsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14&amp;dq=shailputri+parvati&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBWoVChMImaSSiqWQxwIVZxfbCh01ugft#v=onepage&amp;q=shailputri%20parvati&amp;f=false Jha, O.P.

Srikrishna Pustak Bhandar. {{ISBN|9788188514441}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that her father would not marry her to Lord [[Vishnu]] against her wish.

On the third day of the bright half of Bhadrapud, Goddess Parvati made a Shiva [[lingam]] out of her hair and prayed. Lord Shiva was so impressed that he gave his word to marry Goddess Parvati. Eventually, Goddess Parvati was united with Lord Shiva and was married to him with her father's blessing. Since then, the day is referred to as haritalika teej as Goddess Parvati's female (aalika)friend had to abduct (harit) her in order for the Goddess to achieve her goal of marrying Lord Shiva.

Accordingly, Hartalika Teej is seen as a major festival and is celebrated on the third day of the bright half of the North Indian Lunar month of Bhadrapud. The festival women feasting during the evening of Hartalika Teej, praying to Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva, remembering their wedding and staying up all night listening to prayers.&lt;ref name="Ramchandran, Shivani 2013 pp 109-111"/&gt; The fast (also called nishivasar nirjala vrat) commences during the evening of Hartalika Teej and is broken the next day after a full day's observance which involves women not even drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.karwachauth.com/teej.html&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is on praying to Goddess [[Parvati]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w1EbAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=hartalika+fast&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=resisted Maharashtra State Gazetteers: Buldhana 1976]&lt;/ref&gt; whom Shiva desired should be worshipped under the name Hartalika.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bfMcAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=kajari+teej+story&amp;dq=kajari+teej+story&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjgKahUKEwin0YvUq5HHAhXIFdsKHWZ3Cq0 Census of India, 1961: Uttar Pradesh]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main areas of celebration are [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], Uttarakhand, [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]]. In [[Rajasthan]], an idol of Goddess [[Parvati]] is taken out in procession in the streets accompanied by singing,  and music. The Hartalika Teej festival has also spread to parts of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Chhattisgarh]]. The  Hartalika Teej was last celebrated on 12 September 2018.&lt;ref name="drikpanchang"/&gt;

Hartalika Teej of the north is not to be confused with Hartalika Teej of [[Maharashtra]] which is connected to the festival of [[Gowri Habba]].

===Kajal Teej of Andhra Pradesh===
Teej in [[Andhra Pradesh]] forms part of a wider celebration which is a forerunner to other festivals being celebrated and is known as Kajal Teej. Kajal Teej is one of the [[Banjara]] tribe's biggest festivals.&lt;ref&gt;The Banjara: By Shashishekhar Gopal Deogaonkar, Shailaja Shashishekhar Deogaonkar [https://books.google.com/books?id=JNvGp4Yuk4QC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=teej+banjara&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T0gCqvVQrQ&amp;sig=ArB3zdhV-HS20OAwzyxx7oD7ha0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D29jVIKCNuWw7Abm_oCIAQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=teej%20banjara&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite popular in villages and ''thandas''.{{specify|date=August 2014|reason=What is a thanda?}} It is a week-long festival.

Haryali Teej coincides with the swing festival of 'Jhulan Leela' also known as 'Jhulan Utsav' or '[[Hindola]] Utsav'&lt;ref&gt;Vrindaban gears up for colorful Hindola festiva (15.08.2015) Business Standard [http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/vrindaban-gears-up-for-colorful-hindola-festival-115081600557_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; which is associated with Krishna and Radha, and is celebrated at [[Banke Bihari Temple]] and other Temples in the [[Vrindavan]] area of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The festival lasts until [[Krishna Janmashtami]] for 13 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iskconbangalore.org/festival-jhulan-utsav Jhuland Utsav]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of Teej, idols of Krishna and Radha are placed on swings in the Temples and the focus of Jhullan Leela is religious. The green theme, popular in neighbouring [[Rajasthan]] and [[Haryana]] on Haryali Teej, can also be seen in the Jhulan Utsov. Idols of [[Krishna]] and [[Radha]] are dressed in green clothes.

Haryali Teej and Jhulan Ustav fall on the same day. However, Haryali Teej is a monsoon festival dedicated to Goddess [[Parvati]] whereas, Jhulan Utsav is dedicated to Lord [[Krishna]] and [[Radha]].

==Observance in Nepal of Hartalika Teej==
{{Anchor|Observance in Nepal}}
Dedicated to the [[Goddess]] [[Parvati]], commemorating her union with [[Lord Shiva]], the festival is celebrated for well-being of spouse and children and purification of one's [[Human body|body]] and [[soul]]. The festival is a three-day-long celebration that combines sumptuous feasts as well as rigid fasting. Teej is celebrated by women, for the long life of her husband and long and firm relationship between them in this life and all the lives to come.

The folk music and dances add more flavor to traditional values of Teej. Women in red dance and sing in the street, going to temple in holy and fasting mood. Teej is also called Haritalika Teej. This festival is celebrated by Nepali Hindu women all across the world.

===Day One===
[[File:Queue at Pashupatinath01.JPG|thumb|Nepalese Women lined up to making offerings to Parvati and Shiva at [[Pashupatinath Temple]]]]

The first day of Teej is called ''Dar Khane Din''. On this day the women assemble at one place in their finest attire and start dancing and singing devotional songs. Amidst all this, the grand feast takes place. What is unusual about this day is that the feast is hosted by men. Women, who work hard throughout the year, do not have to do anything that day. That is the day for them to embellish themselves in ''sorha singaar'' — dressing up and using make up to the full extent, indulge in good food, and dance. Oftentimes, because women are invited by multiple brothers for the feast, they try to dance off some food before they are ready to eat more. The food served is supposed to be rich and abundant.

This is probably the only day in a year that allows women full freedom of expression. Consequently, women have traditionally used this occasion to express their pains and pang in the songs they sing while dancing. With the advancement of communication and awareness, women these days use this occasion to voice their concerns about social issues and discrimination against women. The jollity often goes on till midnight, after which the 24-hour fast starts.

===Day Two===
The second day is the fasting day. Some women live without food and drops of water while others take liquid and fruit. The fasting is observed by married and unmarried women. Married women abstain strictly from food and drinks with a believe that their devotion to the god will be blessed with longevity, peace and prosperity of their husband and family. Unmarried women observe the fast with a hope of being blessed with a good husband.

They dress gaily and visit a nearby [[Shiva]] temple singing and dancing on the way. The [[Pashupatinath Temple]] gets the highest number of devotees. At the temple, women circumambulate the [[Shiva Lingam]], which symbolizes Lord Shiva, offers the praying with flowers, sweets and coins. The main puja (religious ceremony) takes place with offerings of flowers, fruits, etc., made to Shiva and his wife goddess [[Parvati]], beseeching them to grant their blessing upon the husband and family. The important part of the puja is the oil lamp which should be alight throughout the night. It is believed that by the light of an oil lamp all night will bring peace and prosperity to the husband and family.

===Day Three===
The third day of the festival is [[Rishi Panchami]]. After the completion of the previous day's ''puja'', women pay homage to seven saints or sages, offer prayers to deities, and bathe with red mud found on the roots of the sacred datiwan bush, along with its leaves. This act of purification is the final ritual of Teej, after which women are considered absolved from all their sins. Recent years have witnessed an alteration in the rituals, especially concerning the severity, but its essence remains the same.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Sindh==
The [[Sindhi people|Sindhi community]] in India celebrate Teej which is known as [[Teejdi]]. However, Sindhis celebrate Teejri on the third day after the full moon of Sawan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhulelal.com/calendar/Teejri.htm Jhulelal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sindhiassociation.org.uk/documents/Guidelines%20for%20Teejri.pdf Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Temple of Castor and Pollux''' ({{lang-it|Tempio dei Dioscuri}}) is an ancient [[Roman temple|temple]] in the [[Roman Forum]], [[Rome]], central [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="jr1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=L. Richardson, jr|title=A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA75|date=1 October 1992|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-4300-6|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally built in gratitude for victory at the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]] (495 BC). [[Castor and Pollux]] (Greek '''Polydeuces''') were the [[Dioscuri]], the "twins" of [[Gemini twins|Gemini]], the twin sons of [[Zeus]] ([[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]) and [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]]. Their cult came to Rome from Greece via [[Magna Graecia]] and the Greek culture of Southern Italy.&lt;ref name="Parker1879"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Henry Parker|title=The Archaeology of Rome: Forum romanum et magnum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ux7TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA33|year=1879|publisher=J. Parker|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman temple is one of a number of known Dioscuri temples remaining from antiquity.  

==Founding==

The last king of Rome, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], and his allies, the Latins, waged war on the infant Roman Republic. Before the battle, the Roman [[dictator]] [[Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis]] vowed to build a temple to the Dioscuri if the Republic were victorious.

According to legend Castor and Pollux appeared on the battlefield as two able horsemen in aid of the Republic; and after the battle had been won they again appeared on the Forum in Rome watering their horses at the [[Lacus Juturnae|Spring of Juturna]] thereby announcing the victory. The temple stands on the supposed spot of their appearance. 

One of Postumius’ sons was elected [[Duumviri|duumvir]] in order to dedicate the temple on 15 July (the ides of July) 484 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.42&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Roman Forum and Temple of Castor and Pollux.gif|thumb|Roman Forum and Temple of Castor and Pollux]]

In Republican times the temple served as a meeting place for the [[Roman Senate]], and from the middle of the 2nd century BC the front of the podium served as a speaker's platform. During the imperial period the temple housed the office for weights and measures, and was a depository for the State treasury.

The archaic temple was completely reconstructed and enlarged in 117 BC by [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus]] after his victory over the [[Dalmatia]]ns. [[Gaius Verres]] again restored this second temple in 73 BC.

In 14 BC a fire that ravaged major parts of the forum destroyed the temple, and [[Tiberius]], the son of Livia by a previous marriage and adopted son of Augustus and the eventual heir to the throne, rebuilt it. Tiberius' temple was dedicated in 6 AD. The remains visible today are from the temple of Tiberius, except the podium, which is from the time of Metellus.

According to [[Edward Gibbon]], the temple of Castor served as a secret meeting place for the [[Roman Senate]]. Frequent meetings of the Senate are also reported by [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], [[In Verrem]] 2.1.129&lt;/ref&gt; He said the senate was roused to rebellion against Emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]] and in favor of future emperor [[Gordian I]] at the Temple of Castor in 237 AD.

If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the [[persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]]. The temple was possibly already falling apart in the fourth century, when a wall in front of the [[Lacus Juturnae]] was erected from reused material. Nothing is known of its subsequent history, except that in the 15th century, only three columns of its original structure were still standing. The street running by the building was called ''via Trium Columnarum''. 

In 1760, the Conservatori, finding the columns in a state of imminent collapse, erected scaffolding for effecting repairs. Both [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] and the young English architect [[George Dance the Younger]] were able to climb up and make accurate measurements; Dance had "a Model cast from the finest Example of the Corinthian order perhaps in the whole World", as he reported to [[George Dance the Elder|his father]].&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Frank Salmon, "'Storming the Campo Vaccino': British Architects and the Antique Buildings of Rome after Waterloo" ''Architectural History'' '''38''' (1995:146-175) p. 149f.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today the podium survives without the facing, as do the three columns and a piece of the [[entablature]], one of the most famous features in the Forum.

==Architecture==
The [[octastyle]] temple was [[Glossary of architecture#P|peripteral]], with eight [[Corinthian order|Corinthian columns]] at the short sides and eleven on the long sides. There was a single [[cella]] paved with [[mosaic]]s. The podium measures {{convert|32|×|49.5|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|7|m|abbr=on}} in height. The building was constructed in ''[[opus caementicium]]'' and originally covered with slabs of [[tuff]] which were later removed. According to ancient sources, the temple had a single central stairway to access the podium, but excavations have identified two side stairs.

==Archaeology==
The temple complex was excavated and studied between 1983 and 1989 by a joint archaeological mission of the Nordic academies in Rome, led by Inge Nielsen and B. Poulsen.&lt;ref name="BildePoulsen2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pia Guldager Bilde|author2=Birte Poulsen|title=The Temple of Castor and Pollux Ii,1: The Finds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blFUJDYLG5oC&amp;pg=PA141|year=2008|publisher=L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER|isbn=978-88-8265-463-4|pages=141–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Temples of Castor and Pollux == 

The Roman temple is one of a number of known Dioscuri sites remaining from antiquity.  Among others, 

* the Baroque basilica church of [[San Paolo Maggiore]] in [[Naples]] is built on the site of a Temple of Castor and Pollux.  Its porch and pediment survived until the [[1688 Sannio earthquake]]; only two Corinthian columns remain, incorporated into the facade of the church.
* The vanished [[Anakeion]] near the [[Acropolis]] in Athens was a Dioscuri temple.  Writing in about 150 AD, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] described it as ancient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=W. H.|title=Pausanias Description of Greece|year=1918|publisher=Harvard University Press|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.18.1&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160|author2=Ormerod, H. A.|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Pausanias identified another temple in [[Argos]] depicting Castor and Pollux, their sons [[Anaxias]] and Mnasinus, and their wives [[Hilaeira]] and [[Phoebe (Leucippid)|Phoebe]].
* The extensive ruins of the [[Valle dei Templi]] in [[Agrigento]], [[Sicily]], include the site of another [[Valle_dei_Templi#Temple of the Dioscuri|Temple of the Dioscuri]].  

In his 1888 description of the Dioscuri temple in ancient Greek colonial city of [[Naucratis]] in Egypt, [[Ernest Arthur Gardner]] remarked that such temples were common enough to have a characteristic orientation.  Temples to the gods tended to face east.  Temples to heroes and demi-gods such as Castor and Pollux faced west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Ernest Arthur|title=Naukratis II|date=1 January 1888|publisher=Egypt Exploration Fund|pages=30-31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WA_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Théâtre de l'Athénée''' is a theatre at 7 rue Boudreau, in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]]. Renovated in 1996 and classified a historical monument, it is among the most beautiful{{Who|date=August 2011}} buildings in [[Paris]].  In addition to its architectural treasures, the Athénée inherits an artistic tradition marked by the figure of [[Louis Jouvet]] who directed the theatre from 1934 to 1951. During the period when he was director, it became known as the '''Athenée Théâtre Louis-Jouvet'''.

== History ==

The current Théâtre de l'Athénée was constructed from a foyer (part of the former [[Éden-Théâtre]]), which was converted into an intimate theatre in 1893 by the architect Stanislas Loison with further modifications carried out by the architect Paul Fouquiau in 1894.&lt;ref name=ANNUAIRE/&gt; It opened on 31 December 1894 under the name '''Théâtre de la Comédie-Parisienne'''.&lt;ref name=Lecomte21/&gt;

Oscar Wilde's play ''[[Salomé (play)|Salomé]]'' (originally written in French) was premiered there on 11 February 1896 in a staging by [[Lugné-Poe]]'s theatre group, the [[Théâtre de l'Œuvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Bristow 2009, pp. 98, 106, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The location had become rather unsafe, as demolition work on the Éden-Théâtre was in progress all around it. The police considered banning the performances due to the risk of fire or accident. Their concerns were somewhat reduced by the construction of a temporary 12-meter-long passageway from the theatre to the rue Boudreau.&lt;ref&gt;Tydeman &amp; Price 1996, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year the construction work on the site of the former Éden theatre was finally completed by Fouquiau, and the theatre was reconstituted as the Athénée-Comique,&lt;ref name=ANNUAIRE/&gt; "from the name of a notoriously frivolous, perhaps immoral, establishment nearby that had to close ten years earlier" [see [[Théâtre de l'Athénée (rue Scribe)]]].&lt;ref name=Hartnoll&gt;Hartnoll 1983, "Athénée, Théâtre d l'", p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was renamed Athénée in 1899.&lt;ref name=ANNUAIRE/&gt; For the first 40 years it was the home of [[Comédie en vaudevilles|''vaudevilles'']], comedies, and melodramas.&lt;ref name=Hartnoll/&gt;

In 1934 [[Louis Jouvet]] took control of the theatre and made it famous. He continued to produce and perform there (not exclusively, however), until his death in 1951.&lt;ref name=Hartnoll/&gt; Among the premieres under Jouvet were several plays by [[Jean Giraudoux]], including ''[[Tessa (play)|Tessa]]'' (14 November 1934), ''[[La guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu]]'' (''The Trojan War Will Not Take Place''; 21 November 1935), ''[[Supplément au voyage de Cook]]'' (''The Virtuous Island''; 21 November 1935), ''[[Electra (Giraudoux)|Electre]]'' (13 May 1937), ''[[L'impromptu de Paris]]'' (3 December 1937), ''[[Ondine (play)|Ondine]]'' (3 May 1939), and ''[[La folle de Chaillot]]'' (''The Madwoman of Chaillot''; 22 December 1945),&lt;ref&gt;Garreau 1984b, p. 324,&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Marcel Achard]]'s ''Le corsaire'' (25 March 1938)&lt;ref&gt;Liebowitz Knapp 1957, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[Les bonnes]]'' (''The Maids''; 19 April 1947).&lt;ref&gt;Garreau 1984a, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Jouvet's most successful revivals was [[Molière]]'s ''[[L'école des femmes]]'' (''The School for Wives''; 9 May 1936; 446 performances, plus another 229 on tour), in which Jouvet performed the role of Arnolphe.&lt;ref&gt;Liebowitz Knapp 1957, p. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Renoir]], who had been an actor in Jouvet's troupe, was artistic director, briefly, from 1951 until his death the following year.

In the 2000s the Théâtre Athénée presented revivals of operetta and musical comedy, among which the Brigands company produced ''[[Le docteur Ox]]'' (2003), ''Ta Bouche'' (2004), ''Toi c'est moi'' (2005) and ''Arsène Lupin Banquier'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://comedie-musicale.jgana.fr/theatres.htm L'encyclopédie multimedia de la comédie musicale théâtrale en France (1918-1940)], accessed 9 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Théâtre du Palais-Royal''' ({{IPA-fr|teɑtʁ dy palɛ ʁwajal}}) is a 750-seat Parisian theatre at 38 rue de Montpensier, located at the northwest corner of the [[Palais-Royal]] in the Galerie de Montpensier at its intersection with the Galerie de Beaujolais.&lt;ref&gt;Wild 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief history ==
Originally known as the '''Théâtre des Beaujolais''', it was a puppet theatre with a capacity of about 750 that was built in 1784 to the designs of the architect [[Victor Louis]]. In 1790 it was taken over by [[Mademoiselle Montansier]] and became known as the '''Théâtre Montansier'''. She began using it for plays and Italian operas translated into French and the following year hired Louis to enlarge the stage and auditorium, increasing its capacity to 1300. After Napoleon's [[decree on the theatres]] in 1807 introduced significant constraints on the types of pieces that could be performed, it was used for lighter fare, such as acrobatics, rope dancing, performing dogs, and Neapolitan puppets. In 1812 the theatre was converted into a café with shows.

After the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 some of the restrictions on theatres were relaxed. Dormeuil and Poirson had the theatre remodelled by Louis Regnier de Guerchy and reopened it as the Théâtre du Palais-Royal with a license to present ''comédies'', [[Comédie en vaudeville|''vaudevilles'']], and [[Comédie mêlée d'ariettes|''comédies melées d'ariettes'']], among which were some early works by [[Hervé]]. Later he was its chief musical conductor for several years. The theatre became especially well known for presenting the hilarious comedies of [[Eugène Labiche]].&lt;ref&gt;"Labiche, Eugène-Marin" in ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'' (15th edition, Chicago, 1991) vol. 7, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictions on genre were lifted in 1864,&lt;ref&gt;Hemmings 1994, pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt; and the theatre began to present, not only comedies such as the farces of [[Georges Feydeau]], but also more ambitious productions including [[operetta]]s, the most famous of which was probably Offenbach's ''[[La Vie parisienne (operetta)|La Vie parisienne]]'' in 1866. The actresses [[Hortense Schneider]] and [[Virginie Déjazet]] also appeared there. The unique fire escapes were added in 1880, when the theatre was entirely rebuilt by the architect [[Paul Sédille]].

Gustave Quinson was the theatre's director from 1912 to 1942 and presented comedies by [[Tristan Bernard]] and [[Maurice Hennequin]]. Performers included the actress [[Mistinguett]] and the actor [[Raimu]]. In the 1950s the theatre produced [[Paul Claudel]]'s ''Le soulier de satin'' (''The Satin Slipper'') with [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] and [[Madeleine Renaud]]. Subsequently the theatre began reviving boulevard comedies, such as those by [[Marcel Achard]], Feydeau, and [[Sacha Guitry]]. Performers included Daniel Auteuil, [[Jean-Claude Brialy]], [[Jean-Claude Carrière]], [[Pierre Dux]], [[Edwige Feuillère]], and [[Jean Marais]].&lt;ref&gt;Forman 2010, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the theatre continues to present plays and other light entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theatrepalaisroyal.com/category/spectacles/archives/ Archives at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807150843/http://theatrepalaisroyal.com/category/spectacles/archives/ |date=2012-08-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Théâtre des Beaujolais ==
As early as 1753 a puppet theatre was erected in the northwest corner of the gardens of the [[Palais-Royal]] to entertain the children of its owner, the [[Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]]. In 1780, desiring to live more privately with his new wife, [[Madame de Montesson]], whom he had secretly married because she was a commoner, he transferred ownership of the palace to his son, [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Louis Philippe Joseph d'Orléans]] (at that time the Duke of Chartres). The latter, wishing to add to his income, decided to enclose the gardens north of the palace on three sides with 6-storey apartment buildings having [[colonnade]]s on the interior garden side for shops, restaurants, and places of entertainment. Realizing that the theatre would likely enhance the value of his property and the rents he could charge by increasing the number of visitors, Chartres decided to enlarge it and make it more permanent. The architect he chose to design the new apartment buildings was [[Victor Louis]], who was famous for having designed the [[Théâtre de Bordeaux]]. Construction began in 1781, and the new garden complex was opened to the public in 1784. The new puppet theatre gave its inaugural performance on 23 October and soon became popularly known as the Théâtre des Beaujolais, since this was the name usually given to sons of the [[House of Orléans]] before they became adults. More officially it was known as the Théatre des Petits Comédiens de Son Altesse Sérénissime Monseigneur le Comte de Beaujolais, the [[Louis Charles, Count of Beaujolais|Count of Beaujolais]] being the duke's youngest son.&lt;ref&gt;Hemmings 1994, p. 37; Ayers 2004, p. 48; Lecomte 1905, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TKk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA15  p. 15] (exact date of opening).&lt;/ref&gt;

The director of the theatre was Jean-Nicolas Gardeur, and, as puppet plays were falling out of fashion as adult entertainment, he soon realized he would need to modify the nature of his presentations. His license, however, did not allow his actors to speak on stage. To get around these problems, he used a strategy which in part resembled one previously employed by Audinot at [[Théâtre de l'Ambigu-Comique]]: he replaced the puppets with children. Gardeur's innovation was having the child actors silently mouth words spoken or sung by adult actors, who quietly moved in felt slippers behind the scene. As an English tourist of 1788 later reported: "So perfect is  this deception, that it has given rise to considerable wagers whether the voices did not actually proceed from persons on the stage."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Hemmings 1994, p. 38, who cites Richard Valpy, "A Short Sketch of a Short Trip to Paris in 1788", ''The Pamphleteer'', vol. 3 (1814), pp. 490–552, on p. 539.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was later taken over by a director named Delomel, but by 1789 attendance had declined, and he was in serious financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Netter 1996, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Théâtre Montansier ==
[[File:Foyer du Théâtre Montansier.jpg|thumb|Foyer of the theatre in the 18th century]]

In October 1789 [[The Women's March on Versailles|a revolutionary mob]] forcibly evicted the royal family from the [[Palace of Versailles]] and compelled them to move to Paris. [[Mademoiselle Montansier]], who had been the manager of the [[Théâtre Montansier|theatre at Versailles]], as well as  several other court theatres, followed the king and queen. Needing a theatre near the court's new location at the [[Palais des Tuileries]], and learning of Delomel's situation, she swiftly used her royal connections to acquire his lease. Delomel was evicted in January 1790, after which he transferred his troupe on 22 February to the Théâtre des Élèves de l'Opéra on the [[Boulevard du Temple]], where eventually for lack of adequate receipts he was forced to close permanently on 7 March 1791. Under the name Théâtre Montansier, the theatre in the Palais-Royal reopened on 12 April 1790 with the four-act comic opera ''Les Epoux mécontents'' (''Gli sposi malcontenti'') with music by [[Stephen Storace|Storace]] and a new libretto by Dubuisson.&lt;ref&gt;Huget 1877, [https://archive.org/stream/histoirelittra00hugouoft#page/32/mode/2up p. 32–33].&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 September the company presented the play ''Le Sourd, ou L'Auberge pleine'', a 3-act comedy by [[P. J. B. Desforges]]. It was a major success becoming the most performed play of the Revolution with over 450 performances, 251 at Montansier's theatre alone, where it eventually earned around 500,000 francs, a substantial amount of money for the time.&lt;ref&gt;Netter 1996, pp. 70. Although Huget 1877, p. 32, states that ''Le Sourd'' was first performed on 12 April 1790, Kennedy et al. 1996, p. 141, give the date of the premiere as 30 September 1790.

Accessed 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pitou 1983, vol. 1, p. 38; Lecomte 1905, pp. 94–95, 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately ticket sales began to outstrip the capacity of her theatre. The stage and the seating area were so small, that the ''Almanach des spectacles'' thought "the theatre too small, the actors too large".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted and translated by Carlson 1966, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; During the two-week Easter break of 1791, Montansier hired Victor Louis to enlarge the stage and the auditorium. The capacity of the house was increased to 1300 spectators, and the height and depth of the stage were doubled.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson 1966, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] progressed, Montansier was anonymously accused in political pamphlets, called ''[[libelles]]'', of debauchery in her relations with her lover and partner Honoré Bourdon de Neuville, and in her previous associations with [[Marie Antoinette]]. Later she was accused of concealing weapons intended for counterrevolutionary activities. Montansier attempted to counteract these rumours and accusations, and let it be known her sympathies lay with the new revolutionary government. In 1792 after the [[Campaigns of 1792 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French declaration of war on Austria]] in April and the subsequent revelations of the [[Brunswick Manifesto (1792)|Brunswick Manifesto]] in August, Montansier demonstrated her patriotism by outfitting a contingent of soldiers for the defense of France. Later that year when the French invaded the [[Austrian Netherlands]], under the command of [[Charles François Dumouriez|General Charles François Dumouriez]], Montansier convinced Dumouriez to allow her and her troupe to accompany the army. They may have provided assistance at the [[Battle of Jemmapes]] on 6 November 1792 and for certain entertained the troops after setting up a stage on the battlefield. Later, when the French armies arrived in [[Brussels]], Montansier set up a theatre to present patriotic and propagandistic entertainments, including revolutionary plays by [[Fabre d'Églantine]], Joseph Laignelot, and [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois]]. These efforts did not completely satisfy her critics, however. When her troupe returned to Paris, she was accused of hiding ''émigrés'' in a fictitious third basement in the theatre at the Palais-Royal.&lt;ref name= "Variétés"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Letzter107&gt;Letzter and Adelson (2001), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Timid Tabby''''' is a 1957 one [[reel]] [[animated cartoon|animated]] ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' [[Short subject|short]], directed and produced by [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] with music by Scott Bradley. The cartoon was animated by Lewis Marshall, Kenneth Muse, Irvin Spence, Ken Southworth and Bill Schipek, with backgrounds by Roberta Gruetert and layouts by Richard Bickenbach. It was released on April 19, 1957 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].

This short is one of the select few in which Tom emerges victorious over Jerry.

==Plot==
The short begins with Tom chasing Jerry in circles until he gets a letter that says his (identical) cousin George, who has a [[Musophobia|fear of mice]], is coming to visit.  Tom boards up Jerry's hole to prevent him from scaring George. But Jerry escapes and unexpectedly encounters George, who immediately tries to get as far away from him as possible.

Jerry, not knowing about Tom's cousin, believes that the terrified cat is Tom and tries several attempts to frighten him, including saying "boo" and pulling scary faces. But he gets confused when the real Tom shakes off Jerry's scaring and whacks him with his fist.

Having had enough of Jerry bothering George, the two cats play a trick on him by pretending to be a two-headed, four-armed and four-legged monster which terrifies Jerry and makes him flee the house and also overcoming George's fear of mice. A frightened Jerry runs to a house that has a gate with the words "Home For Mice With Nervous Breakdowns" and enters immediately.

The '''Trans-Am Series''' is an automobile racing series held in North America.

== History ==
{{See also|History of the Trans-Am Series}}

The Trans-Am Series was created in 1966 by [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) President John Bishop. Originally known as the '''Trans-American Sedan Championship''', the name was changed to the '''Trans-American Championship''' for 1967 and henceforth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historictransam.com/history.html|title=Historic Trans Am History|last=Erickson|first=Keith|date=May 17, 2017|website=Historic Trans Am|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005234636/http://www.historictransam.com/History.html|archive-date=2011-10-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series has in fact gone by a variety of different names through the years (too many to list), some linked to sponsors, some not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thethirdturn.com/wiki/Trans_Am_Championship|title=Trans Am Championship|last=Erickson|first=Keith|date=May 17, 2017|website=TheThirdTurn.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has evolved over time from its original format as a Manufacturers' Championship series for modified passenger [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]s and [[Coupé]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to its current form as a Drivers' / Manufacturers' Championship Series that is open to [[Grand Tourer|GT]] style racecars. Champion drivers have been officially recognized, and Drivers' Championships awarded since the 1972 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thethirdturn.com/wiki/Trans_Am_Championship|title=Trans Am Championship|last=Erickson|first=Keith|date=|website=The Third Turn|access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the series has raced on a variety of different types of race tracks (Permanent and temporary road courses / street circuits / airport circuits) all over the country, as well as at venues in Canada, Mexico, and even San Juan, Puerto Rico in 2003. Since 2015, Trans Am has been a national series (Continental U.S. only), racing at tracks primarily throughout the East Coast, South, and Midwest. In 2017, the new stand-alone West Coast Championship Series raced at four tracks—three on the West Coast, and one in Texas that was a 'shared event' with the Trans Am Championship Series. For 2018, the Willow Springs, CA race was dropped from the schedule, Sonoma, CA was added, and a shared race with the main series was added at INDY. Each Championship Series is independent of the other.

== Current Series Format ==

=== Tires / Presenting Sponsor ===
In 2017, [[Pirelli]] became the exclusive tire supplier (replacing [[Hoosier]]) and presenting sponsor for the Trans Am Series, and all classes use Pirelli P ZERO radial ply [[racing slick]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://speedsport.com/road-racing/pirelli-jumps-in-with-trans-am-series/|title=Pirelli Tires becomes official tire supplier|website=Speed Sport|last1=Erickson|first1=Keith|accessdate=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All '''Trans Am by Pirelli''' races go on even if it rains, in which case competitors may pit and change over to softer, treaded [[rain tire]]s. The change from bias ply tires to Pirelli P ZERO radial tires has been very well received, and has resulted in faster average speeds and improved lap times in all four classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gotransam.com/news/index.cfm?cid=65891|title=Pirelli named Official Tire, Presenting Sponsor of the Trans Am Series|last=Erickson|first=Keith|date=July 12, 2017|website=Trans Am Series presented by Pirelli|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Car Classifications ===
A minimum of two functional brake lights in their approximate stock locations are required on &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; cars competing in the Trans Am Series. They must be plainly visible, unobscured, and function just as they would on a production car. Starting in 2018, &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; cars competing in the Trans Am Series must also have "...a minimum of two fully operational rain/tail lights to be used during rain/fog sessions, and/or during twilight sessions." They &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; be used when the track is wet enough to produce spray, and also under foggy / twilight conditions.

==== Tube-Frame / Silhouette Body ====

=====TA=====
[[File:P1020117-001.jpg|thumb|Vinnie Allegretta's Chevrolet Corvette is one of many in the TA class]]
TA class cars are high-performance [[Grand Touring]] race cars with a tubular chassis and a Cadillac CTS-V, Chevrolet Camaro / Corvette, Dodge Challenger, or Ford Mustang body (full-scale replica) built by Advanced Composite Products (all eligible cars except Corvette C7) or [[Derhaag Motorsports]] (Corvette C6, C7 / Camaro Gen 6 only). Many of the entries carry [[Chevrolet Corvette]] bodywork, but there are several [[Ford Mustang]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, a couple of [[Cadillac CTS-V]] coupes, and a [[Dodge Challenger]] in the class as well. All body types are eligible from the first year of production of the street car to 5 years after production ends. After each car model goes out of production, each body will be partially eligible, and may be used in up to three races per year of eligibility. Two fully functional headlights are recommended but not required.

Power comes from overhead valve (two per cylinder), pushrod, naturally aspirated, carbureted 358 cubic inch (5.86 L) V8 engines, producing anywhere from 850 to 875 horsepower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gotransam.com/transam101/TA-Class/59343|title=TA Class|last=Erickson|first=Keith|date=May 17, 2017|website=GoTransAm.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gotransam.com/news/55-car-Trans-Am-Series-presented-by-Pirelli-field-descends-on-Road-Atlanta/66627|title=55-car Trans Am Series presented by Pirelli field descends on Road Atlanta|website=GoTransAm.com|last1=Erickson|first1=Keith|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum base weight (including driver and driver gear) is 2,780 pounds. Fuel cell capacity is 33 U.S. gallons. Current rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gotransam.cdn.racersites.com/assets/2017%20Trans%20Am%20Series%20By%20Pirelli%20Rule%20Book%20v1%20(1-15-17)1.pdf|title=2017 Trans Am presented by Pirelli 2017 Rule Book|website=gotransam.cdn.racersites.com|last1=Erickson|first1=Keith|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow for the use of leaded gasoline, whereas all other classes must use unleaded gas. '''''The use of Nitrous Oxide (or other similar compounds or systems), fuel additives, and/or fuel cooling, as well as supercharging or turbocharging is &lt;u&gt;strictly prohibited&lt;/u&gt; in &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; classes.''''' Automatic transmissions are prohibited, and manual transmissions must have no more than 5 forward speeds, and a functional reverse speed.

===== TA2 =====
[[File:Cameron Lawrence - TA2 Challenger - Daytona November 2014.jpg|thumb|Cameron Lawrence gave Dodge its first ever Trans Am Series Championship in 2014|185x185px]]TA2 class rules specify a tubular chassis built by [[Howe Racing Enterprises]], M-1 Motorsports, Mike Cope Racing, or Meissen Enterprises, and a [[Chevrolet Camaro]], [[Ford Mustang]] or [[Dodge Challenger]] body (full-scale replica) built by either Five Star Racing Race Car Bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fivestarbodies.com/store/index.php?p=catalog&amp;parent=123&amp;pg=1|title=Eligible bodies for TA2 class cars|last=Erickson|first=Keith|date=July 11, 2017|website=Five Star Racing Race Car Bodies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Gen 6 Camaros and Mustangs), or Howe Racing Enterprises (all other eligible cars), with the Camaro body being the most popular by far. (''See current rule book for body eligibility, as it varies according to model and 'Generation''') Two fully functional headlights are recommended but not required. 

TA2 engines are similar to TA engines, but are fuel injected, and must use [[restrictor plate]]s, as maximum power is limited to 490 HP. As per current rules, "''Nothing may direct or force air to the filter or housing.''" Transmissions must be commercially available, 'H pattern' manual units with four forward gears (without overdrive) and a reverse. The minimum base weight (including driver and driver gear) for all cars is 3,000 pounds. The costs of shock absorbers, brake calipers &amp; pads, and wheels are controlled, and no [[titanium]] or [[carbon fiber]] components are allowed, other than the driver's seat. TA2 is currently Trans-Am's most popular class among competitors.

==== Production based ====

===== TA3 =====
[[File:P1020154-001.jpg|thumb|Cars such as this Porsche 991.2 dominate the TA3 class]]
The production based TA3 class cars must be of a number of different specified domestic or foreign makes, models, and year of manufacture, from American "muscle cars" to European exotics – such as Aston Martins, BMWs, Corvettes, Camaros, Vipers, Ferraris, [[Ginetta Cars|Ginetta]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, Mustangs, Lamborghinis, Maseratis, and Porsches. As stated in the current rule book, The "...class is intended for recent model sports cars and new option engine Camaros and Mustangs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gotransam.cdn.racersites.com/assets/2017%20Trans%20Am%20Series%20By%20Pirelli%20Rule%20Book%20v1%20(1-15-17)1.pdf|title=Trans Am 3 Class intended vehicles|website=2017 Trans Am by Pirelli Rule Book|last1=Erickson|first1=Keith|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; But "Additional cars having similar performance capabilities and fitting in with the overall concept of the class will be considered for inclusion in the TA3 class". Eligible cars up to 15 years old will now be able to race in the series, and for 5 years after that, older eligible cars will be able to race in up to 5 races per year of eligibility. Unlike TA4 cars, the current rules allow them to "...compete at a higher level of preparation." Standard body appearance must be maintained, including the OEM grille and badge. Two fully functional (clear or yellow tinted) headlights are &lt;u&gt;required&lt;/u&gt;. As with TA4, Tube frames are not allowed, and roll cages are mandatory. ''Some engines are required to have restrictor plates, for the purpose of equalizing performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gotransam.cdn.racersites.com/assets/2017%20Trans%20Am%20Series%20By%20Pirelli%20Rule%20Book%20v1%20(1-15-17)1.pdf|title=2017 Trans Am by Pirelli Rule Book|website=GoTransAm.cdn.Racersites|last1=Erickson|first1=Keith|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minimum Vehicle Base Weights may be changed for the same purpose.'' 

===== TA4 =====
[[File:P1020158-001.jpg|thumb|Brian Kleeman's Ford Mustang is typical of the TA4 class]]
This class complies more with the "classic" Trans Am standards of the glory era. TA4 class cars must be a modern production-based Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro, Dodge Challenger, Maserati Grand Turismo MC Trofeo/GT4, Porsche Cayman X51 Gen 2&amp;3, Cayman GT4 Club Sport Gen 3, or 2009 - 2013 Aston Martin Vantage GT4 Gen 1&amp;2. The class is intended to be a competition between late model, nearly stock, high-performance cars. It's an affordable class, and a good place for Trans Am Series beginners to start racing in. As with TA3, ''some engines are required to have restrictor plates, for the purpose of equalizing performance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Minimum Vehicle Base Weights are adjusted depending on optional components used.'' Two fully functional (clear or yellow tinted) headlights are &lt;u&gt;required&lt;/u&gt;.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''See current rule book for complete information on all Trans Am Series rules and regulations.''

=== Schedules ===

In late 2016, the Trans Am Race Company (TARC) announced that after a long absence, the Trans Am Series would return to the West Coast with the 2017 '''Trans Am West Coast Championship''', partnering with the [[Sportscar Vintage Racing Association]] (SVRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gotransam.com/news/index.cfm?cid=65732|title=Return of the Trans Am West Coast Championship|website=GoTransAm.com|last1=Erickson|first1=Keith|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Coast Championship Series consists of a separate 3 race competition, plus one round that is shared with the Trans Am Championship Series at [[Circuit of the Americas]]. (3 permanent road courses / 1 temporary road course) 

For 2017, the schedule was reorganized, with five race venues (Homestead-Miami Speedway, Road Atlanta, Watkins Glen, Virginia International Raceway, and New Jersey Motorsports Park) receiving new dates, the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] being added, and Louisiana's [[NOLA Motorsports Park]] being dropped. 

For 2018, the Brainerd, MN and New Jersey Motorsports Park races were dropped, and a race at the Pittsburgh International Race Complex was added for the TA, TA3, and TA4 classes only. There are now 12 race venues on the '''Trans Am Championship''' '''Series''' schedule (8 permanent road courses / 3 temporary road courses / 1 temporary street circuit), with the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix presented by Lear race&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gotransam.com/news/Trans-Am-ready-for-Motor-City-alongside-3-Dimensional-Services/66714|title=Trans Am ready for Motor City alongside 3-Dimensional Services|last=Erickson|first=Keith|date=|website=Trans Am Racing|access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; being open to TA2 class cars only. There are actually 13 actual races on the schedule, as the TA2 cars race twice in Detroit.

For 2018, the '''West Coast Championship'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s race at Willow Springs, CA was dropped, Sonoma, CA was added, and a shared race at INDY was added, expanding their series to a separate 3 round competition, plus two shared races (3 permanent road courses / 2 temporary road courses).

=== Direction of Travel ===
In the Trans Am Series, the direction of travel on the racetrack is up to each race facility. It is usually "clockwise" (right to left, as viewed from outside the track), except at Homestead-Miami Speedway, Circuit of the Americas, and Daytona International Speedway. In the West Coast Championship, the direction of travel is clockwise at Sonoma Raceway, INDY, and Portland International Raceway, and counter-clockwise at Auto Club Speedway and Circuit of the Americas.

=== Event Protocol ===
''*Trans Am Series rules and regulations are extensive and detailed. The main rules relating to a Trans Am race are:''

==== - Practice / Qualifying / Warmup / Race / Length ====
At each race, there are two practice sessions, one qualifying session, an optional warm up session, and the race itself. Since the 1975 season, Trans Am races are ~100 miles in length.

As stated in the current Rule Book, "The normal race length of Trans Am Championship, Presented by Pirelli Races are 100 miles (including the lap that completes the 100 mile length) unless otherwise specified in the Supplemental Regulations or otherwise changed by the CHIEF STEWARD during the course of the event weekend". The CHIEF STEWARD may also limit a race to a certain number of laps, miles, or minutes; whichever comes first. (''See current Rule Book for complete information on race length'' ''and scoring'')

==== - Multiple Class Race / Grid (Field) ====
TA, TA3, and TA4 class cars all "grid" (2 fastest qualifiers on the front row, slower cars behind them according to qualifying times) and race together during the same "race session" (as the rule book puts it), using a staggered start with the two slower classes starting their respective races (in order of class) behind the TA class grid, being separated from each other as well. The fastest qualifiers in each of the four classes may choose to start on the left or right of the next fastest qualifier on the front row. TA2 class cars have their own separate race.

==== - Race Start / Finish ====
The series uses a rolling start with (or without) the pace car proceeding parallel to the field, and in pit lane, approaching the Starter at the Start/Finish line, who uses a green flag to signal the start of the race for each of the 3 classes (or the TA2 field). In the absence of a pace car, or if additional pace laps are required, the "pole" car for each class will serve the same function as the pace car from its position in the front row. At the completion of the last lap, the Starter waves a checkered flag, signifying the end of the race. All winning drivers, as well as second and third-place finishers (plus any award winners announced over the official race control frequency) are required to attend the Winner's Circle ceremonies at the victory podium/rostrum.

==== - Fuel / Pit Stops / Tire marking / Tire changes ====
Trans Am Series racecars carry enough fuel to run the entire race non-stop, making each race a 100-mile sprint that is a test of driver skill and competitiveness. Current rules allow for TA class cars to use leaded (112 Octane) or unleaded (100 Octane) gasoline. All other classes must use unleaded gas. (''All fuel is supplied exclusively by Sunoco Race Fuels'') Fuel and refueling on pit lane, or on the grid is strictly prohibited. Fueling / refueling is only permitted in the team's paddock space.

Pit stops are neither needed nor required, other than for the purpose of changing over to rain tires, or for some other mechanical or other issue. The pit lane speed limit is 45 miles per hour during all sessions (practice / qualifying / race).

As per the current Trans Am rule book, each team has four dry tires (slicks) per car marked by the Trans Am Technical Staff prior to qualifying. "''All cars shall start the race on the same set of marked dry tires that they qualified on, or on the set of dry tires the team had marked prior to qualifying if rain tires (treaded) were used in the qualifying session.''" Teams are only allowed to change one undamaged tire per pit stop without penalty. All damaged tires may be changed without penalty, and a Trans Am pit lane official must verify the damage. Changing over to (or from) any number of rain tires is up to each Crew Chief, and is not limited.

==== - Flags ====
The series uses flags (six 'advisory' / seven  'mandatory compliance') to communicate with competitors during all qualifying, practice, and race sessions. A ''"''Safety Car''"'' is used to lead the field(s) during all Double Yellow Flag periods. All restarts are single file.

The &lt;u&gt;Advisory flags&lt;/u&gt; are GREEN (''beginning or resumption of a session, and that the course is clear''), BLACK AND WHITE DIVIDED DIAGONALLY (''shown once only to the Driver with a number board from the Starter as a Warning for 'Unsportsmanlike Behavior''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'), BLUE WITH YELLOW DIAGONAL or SOLID BLUE (''advisory for competitor following you''), YELLOW WITH RED STRIPES (''caution, the racing surface may be affected by fluids and/or debris''), WHITE (''caution, you are approaching a slow moving vehicle''), and WHITE WAVED AT START/FINISH LINE (''last lap of competition'').

The &lt;u&gt;Mandatory Compliance flags&lt;/u&gt; are BLACK ''(shown to the Driver with a number board from the Starter and/or at designated flag station(s) on the circuit. The Driver must report to Series Officials on pit lane for consultation and/or penalty within four (4) laps or face possible additional disciplinary actions''), BLACK WITH ORANGE DISC IN CENTER (''shown to the Driver with a number board from the Starter and/or at designated flag stations on the circuit to advise of a mechanical problem that may endanger the Driver or other competitors. Driver must report immediately to their assigned pit at reduced speed and may not rejoin the session until released by the Technical Director or his designate''), YELLOW (''local / partial course caution – must reduce speed and line up in single file – no passing''), WAVED YELLOW (''use great caution!''), DOUBLE YELLOW (''full course caution'' ''–'' ''no passing''), RED (''the session has been stopped'' – ''use caution and proceed immediately to pit lane – no passing''), and BLACK AND WHITE CHECKERED (''completion of practice, qualifying, or race'').

In January 2018, the Trans Am Race Company, LLC (TARC) announced that it had "...reached an agreement with Audible Flagging Systems (AFS), now the Official Flagging System Provider of the Trans Am Series presented by Pirelli. AFS, the industry leader for in-car race flagging systems, will be installed in all Trans Am race cars to warn drivers of caution flags immediately and simultaneously. The system is proven to also minimize secondary collisions, which can be particularly dangerous and damaging."

"The onboard system not only flashes a brilliant yellow light inside the car but also emits an audible warning tone to alert competitors of caution conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gotransam.com/news/Audible-Flagging-Systems-Becomes-Official-Trans-Am-Series-Flagging-System-/67733|title=Audible Flagging Systems Becomes Official Trans Am Series Flagging System|last=Erickson|first=Keith|date=January 10, 2018|website=GoTransAm.com|access-date=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new in-car flagging system will be installed free of charge to all Trans Am Series competitors to keep the cost of racing in the series in check. Additionally, the new system is supplemental, and does not replace Race Control, driver spotters, or corner workers (flaggers).

=== Championships / Awards ===

Originally, Manufacturers' Championship points were awarded in all classes to the top 6 finishing positions of each make of car: 9-6-4-3-2-1. Beginning in 1972, the SCCA instituted a Drivers' Championship that would be based on overall finishing position from 1st through 10th places: 20-15-12-10-8-6-4-3-2-1. Beginning in 1990, the top 25 finishers were awarded points as follows: 30-27-25-23-21-19-18-17-16-15-14-13-12-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-1.

Currently, Manufacturers' Championship points are earned in exactly the same manner they were originally. (''*Vehicles must be classified as finishers to score Manufacturers' points.'') Final point standings ties will be decided by which manufacturer has more wins, second-place finishes, etc., as necessary to determine the winner.

Series Champions in each of the four competition classes are determined based on points accumulated during the season. Drivers' Championship points are awarded as follows: At each race, after Qualifying has been completed, 3 points are awarded to the First Qualifier, 2 to the Second Qualifier, and 1 to the Third Qualifier. The top 24 finishers in each class, at each race are awarded points as follows: 30-27-25-23-21-20-19-18-17-16-15-14-13-12-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. All other finishers are awarded 1 point, provided they took the green flag at the start of the race. During each race, 1 point is awarded to any driver leading a lap in class, as well as 1 point for leading the most laps in class for each race. In all classes, the driver's lowest scoring race of the first five events will be dropped, and no Championship points will be awarded for it. (''*A driver must be classified as a starter to score Championship points.'')

Series Champions are awarded the brand new for 2017 Trigon Trophy (sponsored by 3-Dimensional Services Group, and custom designed by longtime partner Crystal Sensations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gotransam.com/news/Trans-Am-Series-presented-by-Pirelli-debuts-new-Crystal-Sensations-Trophies-at-Sebring/66306|title=Trans Am Series presented by Pirelli debuts new Crystal Sensations Trophies at Sebring|last=Erickson|first=Keith|date=July 16, 2017|website=Trans Am by Pirelli|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to The Trans Am Race Company, LLC President John Claggett, "''The base is shaped as a “D”…  The crystal is essentially 3 sided… thus… the Trigon Trophy reflects the sponsorship. And yes… They are beautiful.''" The Trans Am Series' traditional colors are red and black, and Pirelli's color is yellow, with The Trigon Trophies incorporating those design elements.

New for 2018 is the Trans Am Team Championship, with points being awarded to each car/car number. Multiple drivers may compete in the same car / car number in order to earn points towards the Team Championship. The number of points earned follows the same methodology as in the Driver's Championship (according to finishing position), but as the rule book states, ''"In addition to the points earned on-track, teams will be judged by several factors that embody a professional team and help promote, and improve, the Series".''

2018 also introduces the Northern Cup and Southern Cup Regional sub-championships for teams that either do not wish to, or cannot run the entire race schedule, and have run a limited number of races in the past. There are very specific requirements for entry into the regional championships, as they are intended to allow drivers to try competing in the series before committing to running the full schedule of events.

Also new for 2018 is the Master's Championship, which is intended to recognize drivers still actively competing on the racetrack who are over 65 years of age. Again, the points schedule for driver's championship points will be used. The highest finishing Master's Championship driver in each class will be recognized during the podium ceremony after each race. At the end of the year, the top three Master's Championship drivers in each regional series will be recognized at the series awards banquet.

Rookie of the Year winners in each class are also determined by points accumulated during the season.

After the results of each race are "final", the COOLSHIRT Systems "Cool Move of the Race" Award (''If applicable, it is given to the outstanding driver of the race, and the "move" could also be a 'move up through the field'.''), pitboxes.com Crew Award, and Traq Gear Crew Chief Award are given out.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''See current rule book for complete information on all Trans Am Series rules and regulations.''

== Tributes ==
*The "Historic Trans Am Series" is "...simply a group of individuals who wish to share our appreciation for the great race series  -- the Trans Am -- during its heyday from 1966 to 1972." Original racecars from Trans-Am's "golden era" are faithfully restored to original condition, and then "raced" at select events. They are a regular group at historic automobile racing events. In 2010, the [[Monterey Historic Automobile Races]] at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]] in [[Monterey, California]] paid tribute to the under 2000cc group. On occasion, the Monterey Historics and its former sister event at [[Sonoma Raceway]], also in California, have paid tribute to 1980s Trans-Am cars, often referring to them as "IMSA GTO" cars. In recent years, the Sonoma event has referred to them as "SCCA cars".
*A few teams in the Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge, which is reminiscent of the old Trans-Am Series, have painted their vehicles to resemble the old Trans-Am cars. In 2010 [[Multimatic Motorsports]] painted their Ford Mustangs to resemble those of Parnelli Jones and George Follmer. Also entered that year was a modern version of the [[Sunoco]] sponsored Chevrolet Camaro.
*The [[Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]] was named after the series. According to SCCA archives, that brand has taken 7 wins and 1 Championship in the 42 year old series' 450+ events. The last win by a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am was in 1984.
*[[Tommy Kendall]] previously drove a Dodge Challenger using tribute livery modeled after Sam Posey's 1970 Challenger.

==Other series based on the Trans-Am Series model==

The Trans-Am Series has used tube-frame / silhouette cars, similar to the original IMSA GT Series, since the early 1980s, with heavy emphasis on GT cars. The [[SCCA Pro Racing World Challenge]] and [[Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge]] racing series, run by the [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA), and the [[International Motor Sports Association]] (IMSA), respectively, utilize modified production-based cars, sports cars, and touring cars, similar in spirit to the Trans-Am Series since the 1980s.  With the rise of these other series, Trans-Am saw decreased attention from the media, however, [[Speedvision]] did occasionally cover Trans-Am races until the series' demise in 2006.

The '''water buffalo incident''' was a controversy at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1993, in which a [[Jewish]] student, Eden Jacobowitz, was charged with violating the university's racial harassment policy.  The incident received widespread publicity as part of the increasing trend of [[political correctness]] in the United States in the 1990s.  

==History==
The incident occurred on January 13, 1993, when Eden Jacobowitz shouted, "Shut up, you [[water buffalo]]! If you're looking for a party, there's a zoo a mile from here,"&lt;ref name="Penn debates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-10/news/mn-33609_1_water-buffalo|title=Penn Debates the Meaning of Water Buffalo|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 10, 1993|accessdate=March 19, 2018|author=Savage, David G.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604010519/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-10/news/mn-33609_1_water-buffalo|archive-date=2016-06-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of his window to a crowd of mostly black [[Delta Sigma Theta]] [[sorority]] sisters creating a ruckus outside his dorm. Others had shouted at the crowd, but Jacobowitz was the only one charged.

Initially Jacobowitz had an advisor assigned to him, who urged him to accept the University's offer of a settlement. The settlement required him to admit to violating the racial harassment policy. Instead, he contested the university's decision under the advice of Penn history professor and [[libertarian]] activist [[Alan Charles Kors]].

Jacobowitz explained his choice of "water buffalo" as from Hebrew slang, "Behema" (animal or beast, see also [[behemoth]]), used by Israelis to refer to a loud, rowdy person. He procured several expert witnesses who attested to this and others, such as Michael Meyers, President and Executive Director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, who gave testimonies that "water buffalo" was not a racial epithet against [[African American]]s.

Jacobowitz's story was brought to the fore by the media focus on Penn. On April 23, several days before his hearing, the New York-based ''[[The Forward|Jewish Daily Forward]]'' broke his story with the headline "Pennsylvania Preparing to Buffalo a Yeshiva Boy". The story gained even wider media coverage after ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' picked up the story with an editorial entitled "Buffaloed at Penn" on April 26. Jacobowitz was interviewed on television several times.

Based on testimony that Jacobowitz had called the women "water buffalo" and the university's belief that this was a racial epithet, it proceeded with prosecuting him. On May 13, 1993, news anchor [[John Chancellor]] had the following commentary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eden Jacobowitz is a student at the University of Pennsylvania. His studies were interrupted by a noisy crowd of students, many black and female. He yelled out his window, "Shut up, you water buffalo." He is now charged with racial harassment under the university's Code of Conduct. The school offered to dismiss the charge if he would apologize, attend a racial sensitivity seminar, agree to dormitory probation, and accept a temporary mark on his record which would brand him as guilty. He was told the term "water buffalo" could be interpreted as racist because a water buffalo is a dark primitive animal that lives in Africa. That is questionable semantics, dubious zoology, and incorrect geography. Water buffalo live in Asia, not in Africa. This from the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Jacobowitz is fighting back. The rest of us, however, are still in trouble. The language police are at work on the campuses of our better schools. The word cops are marching under the banner of political correctness. The culture of victimization is hunting for quarry. American English is in danger of losing its muscle and energy. That's what these bozos are doing to us&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://partners.nytimes.com/books/first/k/kors-university.html |title=The Shadow University |publisher=Partners.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709085033/http://partners.nytimes.com/books/first/k/kors-university.html |archive-date=2009-07-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Vernon Jordan]] offered a dissenting viewpoint years later when he wrote "the participant in the white mob became a hero for the right wing, while the four black women remained faceless and the objects of national ridicule."&lt;ref name="Jordan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=Vernon|authorlink=Vernon Jordan|editor=Sheldon Hackney|title=The Politics of Presidential Appointment: A Memoir of the Culture War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbtIAQAAQBAJ|publisher=NewSouth Books|isbn=978-1-58838-068-5|page=9|chapter=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; University President [[Sheldon Hackney]] argued that the incident "was hijacked for ideological purposes" and that dismissing the phrase as harmless "ignores the long history of animalistic representations of African Americans as part of white supremacy's mind game [and] ignores the question of what the women thought they heard and why they got so angry."&lt;ref name="Hackney"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackney|first=Sheldon|authorlink=Sheldon Hackney|title=The Politics of Presidential Appointment: A Memoir of the Culture War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbtIAQAAQBAJ|publisher=NewSouth Books|isbn=978-1-58838-068-5|page=101|chapter=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the public outcry and widespread media coverage, the University refused to discuss or explain its actions.{{fact|date=September 2015}} The hearing was delayed for another two months while international press commented and criticized Penn's decisions. [[Garry Trudeau]] devoted a Sunday's ''[[Doonesbury]]'' to the water buffalo incident.&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau, Garry. [http://www.gocomics.com/doonesbury/1993/07/11 Doonesbury Comic Strip, July 11 1993] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412035056/http://www.gocomics.com/doonesbury/1993/07/11 |date=2010-04-12 }}. [[GoComics.com]]. Retrieved 6 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite repeated requests by Jacobowitz's legal teams to have charges dropped, the University pressed forward.{{fact|date=September 2015}} At the hearing the panel decided not to dismiss the charges and issued a [[gag order]] to keep proceedings from leaking to the press. The University's actions during the hearing would later come under some fire when it was revealed that it charged him with using racial epithets despite knowing that he had been absolved by a university police investigation.{{fact|date=September 2015}}

After intense scrutiny by reporters, the University denied issuing a gag order, and [[Sheldon Hackney]] offered Kors a deal in which Jacobowitz would apologize for rudeness and the University and the plaintiffs would drop the charges. The affair ended when at a press conference the 15 women agreed to drop charges, stating that the media coverage made it unlikely they would get a fair hearing. The University stated there were no charges pending.

A second student, Jacobowitz's roommate, was also charged by the university and placed on probation for his part in the original midnight ruckus.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The second student had agreed to probation in order to avoid a hearing, which he felt would require an attorney his family could not afford. After the university dropped charges against Jacobowitz, the second student's faculty counselor sought to have the penalty of probation reversed, but Robin Read, the university's judicial officer overseeing the case, refused, even though the second student had not been the one to yell "water buffalo." He said he had only been one of several students to yell at the women during the disturbance.
