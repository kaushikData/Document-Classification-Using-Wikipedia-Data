'''170''' ('''one hundred [and] seventy''') is the [[natural number]] following [[169 (number)|169]] and preceding [[171 (number)|171]].

==In mathematics==

170 is the smallest ''n'' for which φ(''n'') and σ(''n'') are both square (64 and 324 respectively). But 170 is never a solution for φ(''x''), making it a [[nontotient]]. Nor is it ever a solution to ''x'' - φ(''x''), making it a [[noncototient]].

170 is a [[repdigit]] in [[base 4]] (2222) and [[base 16]] (AA), as well as in bases 33, 84, and 169. It is also a [[sphenic number]].

170 is the largest integer for which its [[factorial]] can be stored in [[double-precision floating-point format]]. This is probably why it is also the largest [[factorial]] that [[Google]]'s built-in [[calculator]] will calculate, returning the answer as 170! = 7.25741562 × 10&lt;sup&gt;306&lt;/sup&gt;.

There are 170 different [[cyclic permutation|cyclic]] [[Gilbreath permutation]]s on 12 elements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A000048}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore there are 170 different [[real number|real]] periodic points of order 12 on the [[Mandelbrot set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Magical Mathematics: the mathematical ideas that animate great magic tricks|first1=Persi|last1=Diaconis|author1-link=Persi Diaconis|first2=Ron|last2=Graham|author2-link=Ronald Graham (mathematician)|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|chapter=Chapter 5: From the Gilbreath Principle to the Mandelbrot Set|pages=61–83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sports==
* 170 is the maximum check-out possible in a standard game of [[darts]] (where the final score must be a double). It consists of two treble-twenties and a double-bullseye.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Caddie Was a Reindeer: And Other Tales of Extreme Recreation|first=Steve|last=Rushin|publisher=Grove Press|year=2007|isbn=9781555847333|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mSlZuuQ6lIC&amp;pg=PA79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A Mathematical Programming Language''' ('''AMPL''') is an [[algebraic modeling language]] to describe and solve high-complexity problems for large-scale mathematical computing (i.e., large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems).&lt;ref name="ampl-book"&gt;
{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It was developed by [[Robert Fourer]], David Gay, and [[Brian Kernighan]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]].
AMPL supports dozens of [[solver]]s, both [[Open-source software|open source]] and [[commercial software]], including CBC, [[CPLEX]], [[FortMP]], [[Gurobi]], [[MINOS (optimization software)|MINOS]], [[IPOPT]], [[SNOPT]], [[KNITRO]], and LGO. Problems are passed to solvers as [[nl (format)|nl]] files.
AMPL is used by more than 100 corporate clients, and by government agencies and academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web
  | title=Position Available
  | url=http://www.ampl.com/OPENINGS/2011July.html#Product
  | accessdate=2011-07-29}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

One advantage of AMPL is the similarity of its syntax to the mathematical notation of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of [[mathematical programming|optimization]]. Many modern solvers available on the [[NEOS Server]] (formerly hosted at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], currently hosted at the [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]]&lt;ref name="neos-uwm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neos-guide.org/About/|title=About|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) accept AMPL input. According to the NEOS statistics AMPL is the most popular format for representing mathematical programming problems.

==Features==
AMPL features a mix of [[declarative programming|declarative]] and [[imperative programming|imperative]] programming styles. Formulating optimization models occurs via declarative language elements such as sets, scalar and multidimensional parameters, decision variables, objectives and constraints, which allow for concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization.

Procedures and [[control flow]] statements are available in AMPL for
* the exchange of data with external data sources such as [[spreadsheet]]s, [[database]]s, [[XML]] and text files
* data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models
* the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available.

To support re-use and simplify construction of large-scale optimization problems, AMPL allows separation of model and data.

AMPL supports a wide range of problem types, among them:
* [[Linear programming]]
* [[Quadratic programming]]
* [[Nonlinear programming]]
* [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|Mixed-integer programming]]
* Mixed-integer quadratic programming with or without [[Convex function|convex]] quadratic constraints
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* [[Second-order cone programming]]
* [[Global optimization]]
* [[Semidefinite programming]] problems with [[Bilinear form|bilinear]] matrix inequalities
* [[Complementarity theory]] problems (MPECs) in discrete or continuous variables
* [[Constraint programming]]&lt;ref name="cp-support"&gt;

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

AMPL invokes a solver in a separate process which has these advantages:
* User can interrupt the solution process at any time
* Solver errors do not affect the interpreter
* 32-bit version of AMPL can be used with a 64-bit solver and vice versa
Interaction with the solver is done through a well-defined [[nl (format)|nl interface]].

==Availability==
[[File:Neos-stats-2011-01.png|right|thumb|352px|[[Argonne National Laboratory#User facilities|NEOS]] input statistics for January 2011.]]
AMPL is available for many popular 32- and 64-bit [[operating system]]s including [[Linux]], Mac [[OS X]], some [[Unix]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ampl.com/products/ampl/ AMPL page at AMPL Optimization Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The translator is proprietary software maintained by AMPL Optimization LLC. However, several online services exist, providing free modeling and solving facilities using AMPL.&lt;ref name="neos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neos-server.org/neos/|title=NEOS Server for Optimization|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampl.com/TRYAMPL/|title=Try AMPL!|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A free student version with limited functionality and a free full-featured version for academic courses are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html|title=AMPL Downloads|publisher=|accessdate=11 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526013237/http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html|archive-date=26 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMPL can be used from within [[Microsoft Excel]] via the [[SolverStudio]] Excel add-in.

The AMPL Solver Library (ASL), which allows reading nl files and provides the automatic differentiation, is open-source. It is used in many solvers to implement AMPL connection.

==Overview==
''Algorithms of Oppression'' is a text based on over six years of academic research on Google search algorithms. Noble argues that though algorithms themselves may not be racist, they can [[Algorithmic bias|reflect the biases]] and values of the people who create them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/06/scholar-sets-twitter-furor-critiquing-book-he-hasnt-read|title=Scholar sets off Twitter furor by critiquing a book he hasn't read|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/algorithms-of-oppression-racist/|title=Can an algorithm be racist?

==Critical reception==
Critical reception for ''Algorithms of Oppression'' has been largely positive. In the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', Emily Drabinski writes, "What emerges from these pages is the sense that Google’s algorithms of oppression comprise just one of the hidden infrastructures that govern our daily lives, and that the others are likely just as hard-coded with white supremacy and misogyny as the one that Noble explores."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/ideologies-of-boring-things-the-internet-and-infrastructures-of-race/#!|title=Ideologies of Boring Things: The Internet and Infrastructures of Race - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[PopMatters]],'' Hans Rollman describes writes that ''Algorithms of Oppression'' "demonstrate[s] that search engines, and in particular [[Google]], are not simply imperfect machines, but systems designed by humans in ways that replicate the power structures of the western countries where they are built, complete with all the sexism and racism that are built into those structures."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In ''[[Booklist]],'' reviewer Lesley Williams states, "Noble’s study should prompt some soul-searching about our reliance on commercial search engines and about digital social equity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Algorithms-of-Oppression-How-Search-Engines-Reinforce-Racism-Safiya-Umoja-Noble/pid=9240185|title=Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism, by Safiya Umoja  Noble {{!}} Booklist Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early February 2018, ''Algorithms of Oppression'' received press attention when the official [[Twitter]] account for the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] expressed criticism of the book, citing that the thesis of the text, based on the text of the book's official blurb on commercial sites, could not be reproduced. IEEE's outreach historian, Alexander Magoun, later revealed that he had not read the book, and issued an apology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Antonio Maria Bordoni''' (19 July 1789 – 26 March 1860) was an Italian mathematician who did research on [[mathematical analysis]], [[geometry]], and [[mechanics]]. Joining the faculty of the [[University of Pavia]] in 1817, Bordoni is generally considered to be the founder of the mathematical school of Pavia. He was a member of various learned academies, notably the [[Accademia nazionale delle scienze detta dei XL|Accademia dei XL]]. Bordoni's famous students were [[Francesco Brioschi]], [[Luigi Cremona]], [[Eugenio Beltrami]] and [[Felice Casorati (mathematician)|Felice Casorati]].

==Biography==
Antonio Bordoni was born in Mezzana Corti (province of [[Pavia]]) on 19 July 1788, and graduated in [[Mathematics]] from Pavia on 7 June 1807.

After just two months he was appointed teacher of mathematics at the military School of Pavia, established by Napoleon, and held such office until 1816 when the school was closed due to the political situation of the times.

On 1 November 1817 he became full professor of Elementary Pure mathematics at the University and in 1818 he held the chair of [[Infinitesimal Calculus]], [[Geodesy]] and [[Hydrometry]], a discipline he taught for 23 years.

In 1827 and 1828 he was dean of the University itself. In 1854, as the Faculty of Mathematics of the [[University of Pavia]] (it previously belonged to the one of the [[Philosophy]]) was established, he was elected Director of Mathematical Studies and held such office until his death, which occurred 26 March 1860, just a month after being appointed senator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10032">[[File:Comparison .jpg|thumb|Figure 1.Comparison of different schemes]]
In [[applied mathematics]], the '''central differencing scheme''' is a [[finite difference method]]. The finite difference method optimizes the approximation for the differential operator in the central node of the considered patch and provides numerical solutions to differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;Computational fluid dynamics –T CHUNG, {{ISBN|0-521-59416-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central differencing scheme is one of the schemes used to solve the integrated [[convection-diffusion equation]] and to calculate the transported property Φ at the e and w faces. The advantages of this method are that it is easy to understand and to implement, at least for simple material relations, and that its convergence rate is faster than some other finite differencing methods, such as forward and backward differencing.  The right hand side of the convection-diffusion equation which basically highlights the diffusion terms  can be represented using central difference approximation. Thus, in order to simplify the solution and analysis, linear interpolation can be used logically to compute the cell face values for the left hand side of this equation which is nothing but the convective terms. Therefore, cell face values of  property for a uniform grid can be written as &lt;ref&gt;An introduction to computational fluid dynamics by HK VERSTEEG  and W.MALALASEKERA, {{ISBN|0-582-21884-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Phi_e =(\Phi_P + \Phi_E)/2&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Phi_w =(\Phi_W + \Phi_P)/2&lt;/math&gt;

==Steady-state convection diffusion equation==

The [[convection–diffusion equation]] is a collective representation of both diffusion and convection equations and describes or explains every physical phenomenon involving the two processes: convection and diffusion in transferring of particles, energy or other physical quantities inside a physical system. The convection-diffusion is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;An introduction to computational fluid dynamics by HK VERSTEEG  and W.MALALASEKERA, {{ISBN|0-582-21884-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div}(\rho u\varphi)=\operatorname{div}(\Gamma\nabla\varphi)+S_\varphi; \,&lt;/math&gt;

here Г is [[diffusion coefficient]] and Φ is the [[property]]

==Formulation of steady-state convection diffusion equation==

Formal [[Integral|integration]] of steady-state convection–diffusion equation over a [[control volume]] gives

: &lt;math&gt;\int\limits_A \, n\cdot(\rho u\varphi)\,dA = \int\limits_A \,n \cdot (\Gamma\nabla\varphi)\,dA+\int\limits_{CV}\,S_\varphi \,dV&lt;/math&gt; → Equation 1.

This equation represents flux balance in a control volume. The left hand side gives the net convective flux and the right hand side contains the net diffusive flux and the generation or destruction of the property within the control volume.

In the absence of source term equation one becomes

: &lt;math&gt;{d \over dx}(\rho u\varphi) = {d \over dx}\left( {d\varphi \over dx}\right) &lt;/math&gt; → Equation 2.

[[Continuity equation]]:
: &lt;math&gt;{d \over dx}(\rho u)=0 &lt;/math&gt; → Equation 3.

[[File:Interpolation value.png|thumb|Figure 2. Interpolation method]]

Assuming a control volume and integrating equation 2 over control volume gives:
    
: &lt;math&gt;(\rho u\varphi A)_e  - (\rho u\varphi A)_w = (\Gamma A d\varphi /dx)_e -   (\Gamma A d\varphi /dx)_w&lt;/math&gt; → '''Integrated convection–diffusion equation'''

Integration of equation 3 yields:

: &lt;math&gt;(\rho uA)_e - (\rho uA)_w = 0&lt;/math&gt;                                           →  '''Integrated continuity equation'''

It is convenient to define two variables to represent the convective mass flux per unit area and diffusion conductance at cell faces which is as follows :

: &lt;math&gt;F = \rho u&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;D = \Gamma / \delta x&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming &lt;math&gt;A_e = A_w&lt;/math&gt; ,   we can write integrated convection–diffusion equation as:

: &lt;math&gt;F_e \varphi_e - F_w \varphi_w = D_e( \varphi_E - \varphi_P ) - D_w(\varphi_P - \varphi_W)&lt;/math&gt;

And integrated continuity equation as:

: &lt;math&gt;F_e - F_w = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In central differencing scheme we try linear interpolation to compute cell face values for convection terms.

For a uniform grid we can write cell face values of property Φ as

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_e = (\varphi_E + \varphi_P)/2, \quad \varphi_w = (\varphi_P + \varphi_W)/2&lt;/math&gt;

On substituting this into integrated convection – diffusion equation we obtain,

: &lt;math&gt;F_e\frac{\varphi_E + \varphi_P}2 - F_w\frac{\varphi_W + \varphi_P}2 = D_e(\varphi_E - \varphi_P) -  D_w(\varphi_P - \varphi_W)&lt;/math&gt;

And on rearranging,

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\left(D_w + \frac{F_w}2\right) + \left(D_e - \frac{F_e}2\right) + (F_e - F_w)\right]\varphi_P = \left(D_w + \frac{F_w}2 \right)\varphi_W + \left(D_e - \frac{F_e}2 \right)\varphi_E&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a_P \varphi_P =  a_W \varphi_W + a_E\varphi_E&lt;/math&gt;

==Different aspects of central differencing scheme==

=== Conservativeness ===

Conservation is ensured in central differencing scheme since overall flux balance is obtained by summing the net flux through each control volume taking into account the boundary fluxes for the control volumes around nodes 1 and 4. 
[[File:Typical Illustration.png|thumb|Figure 3.Typical illustration]]
 
Boundary flux for control volume around node 1 and 4

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left[\frac{\Gamma_{e_1} (\varphi_2 - \varphi_1)}{ \delta x} - q_A\right] + \left[ \frac {\Gamma_{e_2} (\varphi_3 - \varphi_2)}{ \delta x} - \frac{ \Gamma_{w_2} (\varphi_2 - \varphi_1)}{ \delta x}\right] \\[10pt]
+ {} &amp; \left[ \frac{ \Gamma_{e_3} (\varphi_4 - \varphi_3)}{\delta x} - \frac{\Gamma_{w_3} (\varphi_3 - \varphi_2)}{\delta x}\right] + \left[q_B -  \frac{\Gamma_{w_4} (\varphi_4 - \varphi_3)}{\delta x}\right] = q_B - q_A
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

because &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{e_1} = \Gamma_{w_2} , \Gamma_{e_2} = \Gamma_{w_3} , \Gamma_{e_3} = \Gamma_{w_4}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Boundedness ===

Central differencing scheme satisfies first condition of [[Bounded set|Boundedness]].
 
Since &lt;math&gt;F_e - F_w = 0&lt;/math&gt; from continuity equation, therefore; &lt;math&gt;a_P \varphi_P =  a_W \varphi_W + a_E\varphi_E&lt;/math&gt;

Another essential requirement for Boundedness is that all coefficients of the discretised equations should have the same sign (usually all positive). But this is only satisfied when    ([[peclet number]]) &lt;math&gt;F_e/D_e &lt; 2&lt;/math&gt; because for a unidirectional flow(&lt;math&gt;F_e &gt;0, F_w &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;)   &lt;math&gt;a_E = (D_e - F_e/2)&lt;/math&gt; is always positive if  &lt;math&gt;D_e &gt; F_e/2&lt;/math&gt;

=== Transportiveness ===

It requires that transportiveness changes according to magnitude of peclet number i.e. when pe is zero  &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is spread in all directions equally  and as Pe increases (convection&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;diffusion) &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;  at a point largely depends on upstream value and less on downstream value. But central differencing scheme does not possess Transportiveness at higher pe since Φ at a point is average of neighbouring nodes for all Pe.

=== Accuracy ===

The [[Taylor series]] truncation error of the central differencing scheme is second order. 
Central differencing scheme will be accurate only if Pe &lt; 2.
Owing to this limitation central differencing is not a suitable discretisation practice for general purpose flow calculations.

==Applications of central differencing scheme==

*Central difference type schemes are currently being applied on a regular basis in the solution of the [[Euler equations]] and [[Navier–Stokes equations]].
*The results using central differencing approximation have demonstrated noticeable improvements in accuracy in smooth regions.
*[[Shock wave]] representation and [[boundary-layer]] definition can be improved on coarse meshes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002110050345 | doi=10.1007/s002110050345 | volume=79 | title=Third order nonoscillatory central scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws | journal=Numerische Mathematik | pages=397–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

*The central-difference schemes are simpler to program and require less computer time per time step, and work well with multigrid [[acceleration]] techniques.
*The central difference schemes have a free parameter in conjunction with the fourth-difference dissipation. 
*This dissipation is needed to approach a steady state.
*This scheme is more accurate than the first order upwind scheme if Peclet number is less than 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002110050345 | doi=10.1007/s002110050345 | volume=79 | title=Third order nonoscillatory central scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws | journal=Numerische Mathematik | pages=397–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==

* The central differencing scheme is somewhat more dissipative.
* This scheme leads to [[oscillations]] in the solution or divergence if the local Peclet number is larger than 2.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bakker.org/dartmouth06/engs150/05-solv.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], '''conjunction elimination''' (also called '''''and''''' '''elimination''', '''∧ elimination''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=David A. Duffy | title=Principles of Automated Theorem Proving | location=New York | publisher=Wiley | year=1991 }} Sect.3.1.2.1, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; or '''simplification''')&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen{{cn|reason=Without title, this is hardly a useful reference.|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker{{cn|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurley{{cn|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[immediate inference]], [[argument form]] and [[rule of inference]] which makes the [[inference]] that, if the [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] ''A and B'' is true, then ''A'' is true, and ''B'' is true. The rule makes it possible to shorten longer [[formal proof|proofs]] by deriving one of the conjuncts of a conjunction on a line by itself. 

An example in [[English language|English]]:
:It's raining and it's pouring.
:Therefore it's raining.

The rule consists of two separate sub-rules, which can be expressed in [[formal language]] as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \land Q}{\therefore P}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \land Q}{\therefore Q}&lt;/math&gt;

The two sub-rules together mean that, whenever an instance of "&lt;math&gt;P \land Q&lt;/math&gt;" appears on a line of a proof, either "&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;" or "&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;" can be placed on a subsequent line by itself. The above example in English is an application of the first sub-rule.

== Formal notation ==
The ''conjunction elimination'' sub-rules may be written in [[sequent]] notation:

: &lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \vdash P&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \vdash Q&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of &lt;math&gt;P \land Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is also a syntactic consequence of &lt;math&gt;P \land Q&lt;/math&gt; in [[formal system|logical system]];

and expressed as truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] or [[theorems]] of propositional logic:

:&lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \to P&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \to Q&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2219">In [[statistics]] and [[econometrics]], a '''cross-sectional regression''' is a type of [[Regression analysis|regression]] in which the [[Dependent and independent variables|explained and explanatory variables]] are associated with one period or point in time.  This type of [[cross-sectional analysis]] is in contrast to a [[time-series regression]] or [[longitudinal study|longitudinal regression]] in which the variables are considered to be associated with a sequence of points in time.

For example, in [[economics]] a regression to explain and predict [[money demand]] (how much people choose to hold in the form of the most liquid assets) could be conducted with either [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]] or [[time series]] data. A cross-sectional regression would have as each data point an observation on a particular individual's money holdings, income, and perhaps other variables at a single point in time, and different data points would reflect different individuals at the same point in time. In contrast, a regression using time series would have as each data point an entire economy's money holdings, income, etc. at one point in time, and different data points would be drawn on the same economy but at different points in time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7234">In [[mathematics]], more particularly in [[functional analysis]], [[differential topology]], and [[geometric measure theory]], a '''k-current''' in the sense of [[Georges de Rham]] is a [[linear functional|functional]] on the space of [[compactly supported]] [[differential form|differential k-forms]], on a [[smooth manifold]] ''M''. Formally currents behave like [[Schwartz distribution]]s on a space of differential forms. In a geometric setting, they can represent integration over a submanifold, generalizing the [[Dirac delta function]], or more generally even [[directional derivative]]s of delta functions ([[multipole]]s) spread out along subsets of ''M''.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega_c^m(M)&lt;/math&gt; denote the space of smooth ''m''-[[differential form|forms]] with [[compact support]] on a [[smooth manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  A current is a [[linear functional]] on &lt;math&gt;\Omega_c^m(M)&lt;/math&gt; which is continuous in the sense of [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s.  Thus a linear functional

:&lt;math&gt;T\colon \Omega_c^m(M)\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

is an ''m''-current if it is [[continuous function|continuous]] in the following sense: If a sequence &lt;math&gt;\omega_k&lt;/math&gt; of smooth forms, all supported in the same compact set, is such that all derivatives of all their coefficients tend uniformly to 0 when  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;  tends to infinity, then  &lt;math&gt;T(\omega_k)&lt;/math&gt; tends to 0.

The space  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D_m(M)&lt;/math&gt; of ''m''-dimensional currents on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a [[real number|real]] [[vector space]] with operations defined by   

:&lt;math&gt;(T+S)(\omega):= T(\omega)+S(\omega),\qquad (\lambda T)(\omega):=\lambda T(\omega).&lt;/math&gt;

Much of the theory of distributions carries over to currents with minimal adjustments. For example, one may define the '''support''' of a current &lt;math&gt;T \in \mathcal{D}_m(M)&lt;/math&gt; as the complement of the biggest [[open set]] &lt;math&gt;U \subset M&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;T(\omega) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Omega_c^m(U)&lt;/math&gt;

The [[linear subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D_m(M)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of currents with support (in the sense above) that is a compact subset of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E_m(M)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Homological theory==
[[Integral|Integration]] over a compact [[rectifiable set|rectifiable]] [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] submanifold ''M'' ([[manifold with boundary|with boundary]]) of dimension ''m'' defines an ''m''-current, denoted by &lt;math&gt;[[M]]&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;[[M]](\omega)=\int_M \omega.\,&lt;/math&gt;

If the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] ∂''M'' of ''M'' is rectifiable, then it too defines a current by integration, and by virtue of [[Stokes' theorem]] one has:

:&lt;math&gt;[[\partial M]](\omega) = \int_{\partial M}\omega = \int_M d\omega = [[M]](d\omega).&lt;/math&gt;

This relates the [[exterior derivative]] ''d'' with the [[boundary operator]] ∂ on the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of ''M''.

In view of this formula we can ''define'' a '''boundary operator''' on arbitrary currents

:&lt;math&gt;\partial\colon \mathcal D_{m+1} \to \mathcal D_m&lt;/math&gt;

via duality with the exterior derivative by

:&lt;math&gt;(\partial T)(\omega) := T(d\omega)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for all compactly supported ''m''-forms ω. 

Certain subclasses of currents which are closed under &lt;math&gt; \partial &lt;/math&gt; can be used instead of all currents to create a homology theory, which can satisfy the [[Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms]] in certain cases. A classical example is the subclass of integral currents on Lipschitz neighborhood retracts.

==Topology and norms==
The space of currents is naturally endowed with the [[weak-* topology]], which will be further simply called ''weak convergence''. A [[sequence]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of currents, [[limit point|converges]] to a current ''T'' if  

:&lt;math&gt;T_k(\omega) \to T(\omega),\qquad \forall \omega.\,&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to define several [[norm (mathematics)|norms]] on subspaces of the space of all currents.  One such norm is the ''mass norm''.  If ω is an ''m''-form, then define its '''comass''' by

:&lt;math&gt; \|\omega\| := \sup\{|\langle \omega,\xi\rangle|\colon\xi \mbox{ is a unit, simple, }m\mbox{-vector}\}.&lt;/math&gt; 

So if ω is a [[tensor rank|simple]] ''m''-form, then its mass norm is the usual L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;-norm of its coefficient. The '''mass''' of a current ''T'' is then defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf M (T) := \sup\{ T(\omega)\colon \sup_x |\vert\omega(x)|\vert\le 1\}. &lt;/math&gt;

The mass of a current represents the ''weighted area'' of the generalized surface.  A current such that '''M'''(''T'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞ is representable by integration of a regular Borel measure by a version of the [[Riesz representation theorem]].  This is the starting point of [[homological integration]].

An intermediate norm is Whitney's ''flat norm'', defined by   

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf F (T) := \inf \{\mathbf M(T - \partial A) + \mathbf M(A) \colon A\in\mathcal E_{m+1}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Two currents are close in the mass norm if they coincide away from a small part. On the other hand, they are close in the flat norm if they coincide up to a small deformation.

==Examples==
Recall that

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_c^0(\mathbb{R}^n)\equiv C^\infty_c(\mathbb{R}^n)\,&lt;/math&gt;

so that the following defines a 0-current:  

:&lt;math&gt;T(f) = f(0).\,&lt;/math&gt;

In particular every [[signed measure|signed]] [[regular measure|regular]] [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a 0-current:  

:&lt;math&gt;T(f) = \int f(x)\, d\mu(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Let (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') be the coordinates in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Then the following defines a 2-current (one of many):   

:&lt;math&gt; T(a\,dx\wedge dy + b\,dy\wedge dz + c\,dx\wedge dz) = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 b(x,y,0)\, dx \, dy.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9964">In [[graph theory]], the '''cycle rank''' of a [[directed graph]] is a [[directed graph|digraph]] [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]] measure proposed first by Eggan and [[Julius Richard Büchi|Büchi]] {{harv|Eggan|1963}}.  Intuitively, this concept measures how close a
digraph is to a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG), in the sense that a DAG has
cycle rank zero, while a [[complete graph|complete digraph]] of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Definitions|order]] ''n'' with a [[self-loop]] at
each vertex has cycle rank ''n''. The cycle rank of a directed graph is closely related to the [[tree-depth]] of an [[undirected graph]] and to the [[star height]] of a [[regular language]]. It has also found use
in [[sparse matrix]] computations (see {{harvnb|Bodlaender|Gilbert|Hafsteinsson|Kloks|1995}}) and [[logic]]
{{harv|Rossman|2008}}.

==Definition==
The cycle rank ''r''(''G'') of a digraph {{math|1=''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'')}} is inductively defined as follows:

* If ''G'' is acyclic, then {{math|1=''r''(''G'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0}}.   
* If ''G'' is [[strongly connected]] and ''E'' is nonempty, then
::&lt;math&gt;r(G) = 1 + \min_{v\in V} r(G-v),\,&lt;/math&gt; where {{tmath|G - v}} is the digraph resulting from deletion of vertex {{mvar|v}} and all edges beginning or ending at {{mvar|v}}.
* If ''G'' is not strongly connected, then ''r''(''G'') is equal to the maximum cycle rank among all strongly connected components of ''G''.
The [[tree-depth]] of an undirected graph has a very similar definition, using undirected connectivity and connected components in place of strong connectivity and strongly connected components.

==History==
Cycle rank was introduced by {{harvtxt|Eggan|1963}} in the context of [[star height]] of [[regular language]]s. It was rediscovered by {{harv|Eisenstat|Liu|2005}} as a generalization of undirected [[tree-depth]], which had been developed beginning in the 1980s
and applied to [[sparse matrix]] computations {{harv|Schreiber|1982}}.

==Examples==
The cycle rank of a directed acyclic graph is 0, while a complete digraph of order ''n'' with a [[self-loop]] at
each vertex has cycle rank ''n''.  Apart from these, the cycle rank of a few other digraphs is known: the undirected path &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt; of order ''n'', which possesses a symmetric edge relation and no self-loops, has cycle rank &lt;math&gt;\lfloor \log n\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; {{harv|McNaughton|1969}}.  For the directed &lt;math&gt;(m\times n)&lt;/math&gt;-torus &lt;math&gt;T_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the [[cartesian product of graphs|cartesian product]] of two directed circuits of lengths ''m'' and ''n'', we have
&lt;math&gt;r(T_{n,n}) = n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r(T_{m,n}) = \min\{m,n\} + 1&lt;/math&gt; for ''m &amp;ne; n'' ({{harvnb|Eggan|1963}}, {{harvnb|Gruber|Holzer|2008}}).

==Computing the cycle rank==

Computing the cycle rank is computationally hard: {{harvtxt|Gruber|2012}} proves that the corresponding decision problem is [[NP-complete]], even for sparse digraphs of maximum outdegree at most 2. On the positive side, the problem is solvable in time &lt;math&gt;O(1.9129^n)&lt;/math&gt; on digraphs of maximum [[outdegree]] at most 2, and in time &lt;math&gt;O^*(2^n)&lt;/math&gt; on general digraphs. There is an [[approximation algorithm]] with approximation ratio &lt;math&gt;O((\log n)^\frac32)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==

===Star height of regular languages===
The first application of cycle rank was in [[formal language theory]], for studying the [[star height]] of [[regular languages]].  {{harvtxt|Eggan|1963}} established a relation between the theories of regular expressions, finite automata, and of [[directed graph]]s.  In subsequent years, this relation became known as ''Eggan's theorem'', cf. {{harvtxt|Sakarovitch|2009}}.  
In automata theory, a [[nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic finite automaton with ε-moves]] (ε-NFA) is defined as a [[n-tuple|5-tuple]], (''Q'', Σ, ''δ'', ''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''F''), consisting of
* a finite [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of states ''Q''
* a finite set of [[input symbol]]s Σ 
* a set of labeled edges ''δ'', referred to as ''transition relation'': ''Q'' &amp;times; (Σ ∪{ε}) &amp;times; ''Q''.  Here ε denotes the [[empty word]].
* an ''initial'' state ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''Q''
* a set of states ''F'' distinguished as ''accepting states'' ''F'' ⊆ ''Q''.
A word ''w'' ∈ Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is accepted by the ε-NFA if there exists a [[directed path]] from the initial state ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to some final state in ''F'' using edges from ''δ'', such that the [[concatenation]] of all labels visited along the path yields the word ''w''.  The set of all words over Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; accepted by the automaton is the ''language'' accepted by the automaton ''A''.

When speaking of digraph properties of a nondeterministic finite automaton ''A'' with state set ''Q'', we naturally address the digraph with vertex set ''Q'' induced by its transition relation.  Now the theorem is stated as follows.

:'''Eggan's Theorem''': The star height of a regular language ''L'' equals the minimum cycle rank among all [[Nondeterministic_finite_automaton#NFA_with_.CE.B5-moves|nondeterministic finite automata with ε-moves]] accepting ''L''.

Proofs of this theorem are given by {{harvtxt|Eggan|1963}}, and more recently by {{harvtxt|Sakarovitch|2009}}.

===Cholesky factorization in sparse matrix computations===
Another application of this concept lies in [[sparse matrix]] computations, namely for using [[nested dissection]] to compute the [[Cholesky factorization]] of a (symmetric) matrix in parallel.  A given sparse &lt;math&gt;(n\times n)&lt;/math&gt;-matrix ''M'' may be interpreted as the adjacency matrix of some symmetric digraph ''G'' on ''n'' vertices, in a way such that the non-zero entries of the matrix are in one-to-one correspondence with the edges of ''G''.  If the cycle rank of the digraph ''G'' is at most ''k'', then the Cholesky factorization of ''M'' can be computed in at most ''k'' steps on a parallel computer with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; processors {{harv|Dereniowski|Kubale|2004}}.

In [[mathematical logic]], the '''deduction theorem''' is a [[metatheorem]] of propositional and [[first-order logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1967, p. 39, 112; Shoenfield 1967, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; It is a formalization of the common proof technique in which an implication ''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'' is proved by assuming ''A'' and then deriving ''B'' from this assumption conjoined with known results. The deduction theorem explains why [[Conditional proof|proofs of conditional sentences]] in mathematics are logically correct. Though it has seemed "obvious" to mathematicians literally for centuries that proving ''B'' from ''A'' conjoined with a set of theorems is tantamount to proving the implication ''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'' based on those theorems alone, it was left to [[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]] and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] to show (independently) this was logically correct in the general case. 

The deduction theorem states that if a formula ''B'' is deducible from a set of assumptions &lt;math&gt;\Delta \cup \{A\}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''A'' is a [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|closed formula]], then the implication ''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'' is deducible from &lt;math&gt;\Delta &lt;/math&gt;. In symbols, &lt;math&gt;\Delta \cup \{A\} \vdash B &lt;/math&gt;
implies &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vdash A \to B &lt;/math&gt;. In the special case where &lt;math&gt;\Delta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[empty set]], the deduction theorem shows that &lt;math&gt;\{A\} \vdash B&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\vdash A \to B&lt;/math&gt;.

The deduction theorem holds for all first-order theories with the usual [[First order logic#Deductive systems|deductive system]]s for first-order logic&lt;ref&gt;An explicit verification of this result may be found in https://github.com/georgydunaev/VerifiedMathFoundations/blob/master/SHEN.v&lt;/ref&gt;. However, there are first-order systems in which new inference rules are added for which the deduction theorem fails.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenbach 2008, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the deduction theorem fails to hold in Birkhoff–von Neumann [[quantum logic]], because the linear subspaces of a [[Hilbert space]] form a [[distributive lattice | non-distributive lattice]]. 

The deduction rule is an important property of [[Hilbert-style system]]s because the use of this metatheorem leads to much shorter proofs than would be possible without it. Although the deduction theorem could be taken as a primitive rule of inference in such systems, this approach is not generally followed; instead, the deduction theorem is obtained as an [[admissible rule]] using the other logical axioms and [[modus ponens]]. In other formal proof systems, the deduction theorem is sometimes taken as a primitive [[rule of inference]]. For example, in [[natural deduction]], the deduction theorem is recast as an introduction rule for "→".{{Citation needed|reason=Not entirely self-evident|date=February 2017}}

==Examples of deduction==
"Prove" axiom 1:
**''P'' 1. hypothesis
***''Q'' 2. hypothesis
***''P'' 3. reiteration of 1
**''Q''→''P'' 4. deduction from 2 to 3
*''P''→(''Q''→''P'') 5. deduction from 1 to 4 QED

"Prove" axiom 2:
**''P''→(''Q''→''R'') 1. hypothesis
***''P''→''Q'' 2. hypothesis
****''P'' 3. hypothesis
****''Q'' 4. modus ponens 3,2
****''Q''→''R'' 5. modus ponens 3,1
****''R'' 6. modus ponens 4,5
***''P''→''R'' 7. deduction from 3 to 6
**(''P''→''Q'')→(''P''→''R'') 8. deduction from 2 to 7
*(''P''→(''Q''→''R''))→((''P''→''Q'')→(''P''→''R'')) 9. deduction from 1 to 8 QED

Using axiom 1 to show ((''P''→(''Q''→''P''))→''R'')→''R'':
**(''P''→(''Q''→''P''))→''R'' 1. hypothesis
**''P''→(''Q''→''P'') 2. axiom 1
**''R'' 3. modus ponens 2,1
*((''P''→(''Q''→''P''))→''R'')→''R'' 4. deduction from 1 to 3 QED

==Virtual rules of inference==
From the examples, you can see that we have added three virtual (or extra and temporary) rules of inference to our normal axiomatic logic. These are "hypothesis", "reiteration", and "deduction". The normal rules of inference (i.e. "modus ponens" and the various axioms) remain available.

1. '''Hypothesis''' is a step where one adds an additional premise to those already available. So, if your previous step ''S'' was deduced as:
:&lt;math&gt; E_1, E_2, ... , E_{n-1}, E_n \vdash S, &lt;/math&gt;

then one adds another premise ''H'' and gets:
:&lt;math&gt; E_1, E_2, ... , E_{n-1}, E_n, H \vdash H. &lt;/math&gt;

This is symbolized by moving from the n-th level of indentation to the n+1-th level and saying 
*****''S'' previous step
******''H'' hypothesis

2. '''Reiteration''' is a step where one re-uses a previous step. In practice, this is only necessary when one wants to take a hypothesis which is not the most recent hypothesis and use it as the final step before a deduction step.

3. '''Deduction''' is a step where one removes the most recent hypothesis (still available) and prefixes it to the previous step. This is shown by unindenting one level as follows:
******''H'' hypothesis
******......... (other steps)
******''C'' (conclusion drawn from ''H'')
*****''H''→''C'' deduction

==Conversion from proof using the deduction meta-theorem to axiomatic proof==
In axiomatic versions of propositional logic, one usually has among the [[axiom schema]]s (where ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' are replaced by any propositions):
*Axiom 1 is: ''P''→(''Q''→''P'')
*Axiom 2 is: (''P''→(''Q''→''R''))→((''P''→''Q'')→(''P''→''R''))
*Modus ponens is: from ''P'' and ''P''→''Q'' infer ''Q''

These axiom schemas are chosen to enable one to derive the deduction theorem from them easily. So it might seem that we are begging the question. However, they can be justified by checking that they are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] using truth tables and that modus ponens preserves truth.

From these axiom schemas one can quickly deduce the theorem schema ''P''→''P'' (reflexivity of implication) which is used below:
# (''P''→((''Q''→''P'')→''P''))→((''P''→(''Q''→''P''))→(''P''→''P'')) from axiom schema 2 with ''P'', (''Q''→''P''), ''P''
# ''P''→((''Q''→''P'')→''P'') from axiom schema 1 with ''P'', (''Q''→''P'')
# (''P''→(''Q''→''P''))→(''P''→''P'') from modus ponens applied to step 2 and step 1
# ''P''→(''Q''→''P'') from axiom schema 1 with ''P'', ''Q''
# ''P''→''P'' from modus ponens applied to step 4 and step 3

Suppose that we have that Γ and ''H'' prove ''C'', and we wish to show that Γ proves ''H''→''C''. For each step ''S'' in the deduction which is a premise in Γ (a reiteration step) or an axiom, we can apply modus ponens to the axiom 1, ''S''→(''H''→''S''), to get ''H''→''S''. If the step is ''H'' itself (a hypothesis step), we apply the theorem schema to get ''H''→''H''. If the step is the result of applying modus ponens to ''A'' and ''A''→''S'', we first make sure that these have been converted to ''H''→''A'' and ''H''→(''A''→''S'') and then we take the axiom 2, (''H''→(''A''→''S''))→((''H''→''A'')→(''H''→''S'')), and apply modus ponens to get (''H''→''A'')→(''H''→''S'') and then again to get ''H''→''S''. At the end of the proof we will have ''H''→''C'' as required, except that now it only depends on Γ, not on ''H''. So the deduction step will disappear, consolidated into the previous step which was the conclusion derived from ''H''.

To minimize the complexity of the resulting proof, some preprocessing should be done before the conversion. Any steps (other than the conclusion) which do not actually depend on ''H'' should be moved up before the hypothesis step and unindented one level. And any other unnecessary steps (which are not used to get the conclusion or can be bypassed), such as reiterations which are not the conclusion, should be eliminated.

During the conversion, it may be useful to put all the applications of modus ponens to axiom 1 at the beginning of the deduction (right after the ''H''→''H'' step).

When converting a modus ponens, if ''A'' is outside the scope of ''H'', then it will be necessary to apply axiom 1, ''A''→(''H''→''A''), and modus ponens to get ''H''→''A''. Similarly, if ''A''→''S'' is outside the scope of ''H'', apply axiom 1, (''A''→''S'')→(''H''→(''A''→''S'')), and modus ponens to get ''H''→(''A''→''S''). It should not be necessary to do both of these, unless the modus ponens step is the conclusion, because if both are outside the scope, then the modus ponens should have been moved up before ''H'' and thus be outside the scope also.

Under the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]], the above conversion process for the deduction [[meta-theorem]] is analogous to the [[Combinatory logic#Completeness of the S-K basis|conversion process]] from [[lambda calculus]] terms to terms of [[combinatory logic]], where axiom 1 corresponds to the K combinator, and axiom 2 corresponds to the S combinator.  Note that the I combinator corresponds to the theorem schema ''P''→''P''.

== Helpful theorems ==
If one intends to convert a complicated proof using the deduction theorem to a straight-line proof not using the deduction theorem, then it would probably be useful to prove these theorems once and for all at the beginning and then use them to help with the conversion:
:&lt;math&gt;A \to A&lt;/math&gt;
helps convert the hypothesis steps.
:&lt;math&gt;(B \to C) \to ((A \to B) \to (A \to C))&lt;/math&gt;
helps convert modus ponens when the major premise is not dependent on the hypothesis, replaces axiom 2 while avoiding a use of axiom 1.
:&lt;math&gt;(A \to (B \to C)) \to (B \to (A \to C))&lt;/math&gt;
helps convert modus ponens when the minor premise is not dependent on the hypothesis, replaces axiom 2 while avoiding a use of axiom 1.

These two theorems jointly can be used in lieu of axiom 2, although the converted proof would be more complicated:
:&lt;math&gt;(A \to B) \to ((B \to C) \to (A \to C))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A \to (A \to C)) \to (A \to C)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Peirce's law]] is not a consequence of the deduction theorem, but it can be used with the deduction theorem to prove things which one might not otherwise be able to prove.
:&lt;math&gt;((A \to B) \to A) \to A&lt;/math&gt;
It can also be used to get the second of the two theorems which can used in lieu of axiom 2.

==The deduction theorem in predicate logic==
The deduction theorem is also valid in [[first-order logic]] in the following form:

*If ''T'' is a [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] and ''F'', ''G'' are formulas with ''F'' [[Well-formed formula#Closed formulas|closed]], and &lt;math&gt;T \cup \{ F \} \vdash G&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T \vdash F \rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, the symbol &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; means "is a syntactical consequence of." We indicate below how the proof of this deduction theorem differs from that of the deduction theorem in propositional calculus.

In the most common versions of the notion of formal proof, there are, in addition to the axiom schemes
of propositional calculus (or the understanding that all tautologies of propositional calculus are to
be taken as axiom schemes in their own right), [[First-order logic#Quantifier axioms|quantifier axioms]], and in addition to [[modus ponens]], one additional [[rule of inference]], known as the rule of [[Generalization (logic)|''generalization'']]: "From ''K'', infer &amp;forall;''vK''."

In order to convert a proof of ''G'' from ''T''∪{''F''} to one of ''F''→''G'' from ''T'', one deals 
with steps of the proof of ''G'' which are axioms or result from application of modus ponens in the 
same way as for proofs in propositional logic. Steps which result from application of the rule of
generalization are dealt with via the following quantifier axiom (valid whenever the variable
''v'' is not free in formula ''H''):

*(∀''v''(''H''→''K''))→(''H''→∀''vK'').

Since in our case ''F'' is assumed to be closed, we can take ''H'' to be ''F''. This axiom allows
one to deduce ''F''→∀''vK'' from ''F''→''K'' and generalization, which is just what is needed whenever
the rule of generalization is applied to some ''K'' in the proof of ''G''.

==Example of conversion==
To illustrate how one can convert a natural deduction to the axiomatic form of proof, we apply it to the tautology ''Q''→((''Q''→''R'')→''R''). In practice, it is usually enough to know that we could do this. We normally use the natural-deductive form in place of the much longer axiomatic proof.

First, we write a proof using a natural-deduction like method:
**''Q'' 1. hypothesis
***''Q''→''R'' 2. hypothesis
***''R'' 3. modus ponens 1,2
**(''Q''→''R'')→''R'' 4. deduction from 2 to 3
*''Q''→((''Q''→''R'')→''R'') 5. deduction from 1 to 4 QED

Second, we convert the inner deduction to an axiomatic proof:
*(''Q''→''R'')→(''Q''→''R'') 1. theorem schema (''A''→''A'')
*((''Q''→''R'')→(''Q''→''R''))→(((''Q''→''R'')→''Q'')→((''Q''→''R'')→''R'')) 2. axiom 2
*((''Q''→''R'')→''Q'')→((''Q''→''R'')→''R'') 3. modus ponens 1,2
*''Q''→((''Q''→''R'')→''Q'') 4. axiom 1
**''Q'' 5. hypothesis
**(''Q''→''R'')→''Q'' 6. modus ponens 5,4
**(''Q''→''R'')→''R'' 7. modus ponens 6,3
*''Q''→((''Q''→''R'')→''R'') 8. deduction from 5 to 7 QED

Third, we convert the outer deduction to an axiomatic proof:
*(''Q''→''R'')→(''Q''→''R'') 1. theorem schema (''A''→''A'')
*((''Q''→''R'')→(''Q''→''R''))→(((''Q''→''R'')→''Q'')→((''Q''→''R'')→''R'')) 2. axiom 2
*((''Q''→''R'')→''Q'')→((''Q''→''R'')→''R'') 3. modus ponens 1,2
*''Q''→((''Q''→''R'')→''Q'') 4. axiom 1
*[((''Q''→''R'')→''Q'')→((''Q''→''R'')→''R'')]→[''Q''→(((''Q''→''R'')→''Q'')→((''Q''→''R'')→''R''))] 5. axiom 1
*''Q''→(((''Q''→''R'')→''Q'')→((''Q''→''R'')→''R'')) 6. modus ponens 3,5
*[''Q''→(((''Q''→''R'')→''Q'')→((''Q''→''R'')→''R''))]→([''Q''→((''Q''→''R'')→''Q'')]→[''Q''→((''Q''→''R'')→''R''))]) 7. axiom 2
*[''Q''→((''Q''→''R'')→''Q'')]→[''Q''→((''Q''→''R'')→''R''))] 8. modus ponens 6,7
*''Q''→((''Q''→''R'')→''R'')) 9. modus ponens 4,8 QED

These three steps can be stated succinctly using the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]]:
*first, in lambda calculus, the function f = λa. λb. b a has type ''q'' → (''q'' → ''r'') → ''r''
*second, by [[lambda elimination]] on b, f = λa. s i (k a)
*third, by lambda elimination on a, f = s (k (s i)) k

==Paraconsistent deduction theorem==
The deduction theorem described above holds in [[paraconsistent logic#An ideal three-valued paraconsistent logic|some versions]] of [[paraconsistent logic]]. Usually the classical deduction theorem does not hold in paraconsistent logic. However, the following "two-way deduction theorem" does hold in one form of paraconsistent logic:&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\vdash E \rightarrow F &lt;/math&gt; if and only if (&lt;math&gt;E \vdash F &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \neg F \vdash \neg E&lt;/math&gt;)

that requires the [[contrapositive]] inference to hold in addition to the requirement of the classical deduction theorem.

==The resolution theorem==
The '''resolution theorem''' is the [[Conversion (logic)|converse]] of the deduction theorem. It follows immediately from [[modus ponens]] which is the elimination rule for implication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2832">In [[probability theory]], the '''Doob–Dynkin lemma''', named after [[Joseph L. Doob]] and [[Eugene Dynkin]], characterizes the situation when one [[random variable]] is a function of another by the [[subset|inclusion]] of the [[sigma algebra|&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebras]] generated by the random variables. The usual statement of the lemma is formulated in terms of one random variable being [[measurable function|measurable]] with respect to the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra generated by the other.

The lemma plays an important role in the [[conditional expectation]] in probability theory, where it allows replacement of the conditioning on a [[random variable]] by conditioning on the [[sigma-algebra|&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra]] that is [[Sigma_algebra#.CF.83-algebra_generated_by_a_function|generated]] by the random variable.

==Statement of the lemma==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be a [[sample space]]. For a function &lt;math&gt;f:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra generated by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the family of sets &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(S)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are all [[Borel set]]s.

'''Lemma''' Let &lt;math&gt;X,Y: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be [[random element]]s and &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X)&lt;/math&gt;  be the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; algebra generated by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X)&lt;/math&gt;-[[measurable]] if and only if &lt;math&gt;Y=g(X)&lt;/math&gt; for some [[Borel measurable]] function &lt;math&gt;g:\mathbf{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The "if" part of the lemma is simply the statement that the composition of two measurable functions is measurable. The "only if" part is the nontrivial one.

By definition, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; being &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X)&lt;/math&gt;-[[measurable]] is the same as &lt;math&gt;Y^{-1}(S)\in \sigma(X)&lt;/math&gt; for any Borel set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, which is the same as &lt;math&gt;\sigma(Y) \subset \sigma(X)&lt;/math&gt;. So, the lemma can be rewritten in the following, equivalent form.

'''Lemma''' Let &lt;math&gt;X,Y: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be random elements and  &lt;math&gt;\sigma(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma(Y)&lt;/math&gt;  the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; algebras generated by &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;Y=g(X)&lt;/math&gt; for some Borel measurable function &lt;math&gt;g:\mathbf{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\sigma(Y) \subset \sigma(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20515">In the [[mathematics]] of [[infinite graph]]s, an '''end''' of a graph represents, intuitively, a direction in which the graph extends to infinity. Ends may be formalized mathematically as [[equivalence class]]es of infinite [[path (graph theory)|paths]], as [[Haven (graph theory)|haven]]s describing strategies for [[pursuit-evasion]] games on the graph, or (in the case of locally finite graphs) as [[end (topology)|topological end]]s of [[topological space]]s associated with the graph.

Ends of graphs may be used (via [[Cayley graph]]s) to define ends of [[finitely generated group]]s. Finitely generated infinite groups have one, two, or infinitely many ends, and the [[Stallings theorem about ends of groups]] provides a decomposition for groups with more than one end.

==Definition and characterization==
Ends of graphs were defined by {{harvs|first=Rudolf|last=Halin|authorlink=Rudolf Halin|year=1964|txt}} in terms of equivalence classes of infinite paths.&lt;ref&gt;However, as {{harvtxt|Krön|Möller|2008}} point out, ends of graphs were already considered by {{harvtxt|Freudenthal|1945}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A '''{{visible anchor|ray}}''' in an infinite graph is a semi-infinite [[simple path (graph theory)|simple path]]; that is, it is an infinite sequence of vertices ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... in which each vertex appears at most once in the sequence and each two consecutive vertices in the sequence are the two endpoints of an edge in the graph. According to Halin's definition, two rays ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are equivalent if there is another ray ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (not necessarily different from either of the first two rays) that contains infinitely many of the vertices in each of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is an [[equivalence relation]]: each ray is equivalent to itself, the definition is symmetric with regard to the ordering of the two rays, and it can be shown to be [[transitive relation|transitive]]. Therefore, it partitions the set of all rays into [[equivalence classes]], and Halin defined an end as one of these equivalence classes.

An alternative definition of the same equivalence relation has also been used:&lt;ref&gt;E.g., this is the form of the equivalence relation used by {{harvtxt|Diestel|Kühn|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; two rays ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are equivalent if there is no finite set ''X'' of vertices that [[Vertex separator|separates]] infinitely many vertices of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from infinitely many vertices of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is equivalent to Halin's definition: if the ray ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from Halin's definition exists, then any separator must contain infinitely many points of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and therefore cannot be finite, and conversely if ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does not exist then a path that alternates as many times as possible between ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; must form the desired finite separator.

Ends also have a more concrete characterization in terms of [[Haven (graph theory)|havens]], functions that describe evasion strategies for [[pursuit-evasion]] games on a graph ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;The haven nomenclature, and the fact that two rays define the same haven if and only if they are equivalent, is due to {{harvtxt|Robertson|Seymour|Thomas|1991}}. {{harvtxt|Diestel|Kühn|2003}} proved that every haven comes from an end, completing the bijection between ends and havens, using a different nomenclature in which they called havens "directions".&lt;/ref&gt;  In the game in question, a robber is trying to evade a set of policemen by moving from vertex to vertex along the edges of ''G''. The police have helicopters and therefore do not need to follow the edges; however the robber can see the police coming and can choose where to move next before the helicopters land. A haven is a function &amp;beta; that maps each set ''X'' of police locations to one of the connected components of the subgraph formed by deleting ''X''; a robber can evade the police by moving in each round of the game to a vertex within this component. Havens must satisfy a consistency property (corresponding to the requirement that the robber cannot move through vertices on which police have already landed): if ''X'' is a subset of ''Y'', and both ''X'' and ''Y'' are valid sets of locations for the given set of police, then &amp;beta;(''X'') must be a superset of &amp;beta;(''Y''). A haven has order ''k'' if the collection of police locations for which it provides an escape strategy includes all subsets of fewer than ''k'' vertices in the graph; in particular, it has order [[Aleph number|ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] if it maps every finite subset ''X'' of vertices to a component of ''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''X''. Every ray in ''G'' corresponds to a haven of order ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, namely, the function &amp;beta; that maps every finite set ''X'' to the unique component of ''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''X'' that contains infinitely many vertices of the ray. Conversely, every haven of order ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be defined in this way by a ray.&lt;ref&gt;The proof by {{harvtxt|Diestel|Kühn|2003}} that every haven can be defined by a ray is nontrivial and involves two cases. If the set &lt;math&gt;S=\bigcap_X\left(\beta(X)\cup X\right)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''X'' ranges over all finite sets of vertices) is infinite, then there exists a ray that passes through infinitely many vertices of ''S'', which necessarily determines &amp;beta;. On the other hand, if ''S'' is finite, then {{harvtxt|Diestel|Kühn|2003}} show that in this case there exists a sequence of finite sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; that separate the end from all points whose distance from an arbitrarily chosen starting point in ''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''S'' is ''i''. In this case, the haven is defined by any ray that is followed by a robber using the haven to escape police who land at set ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in round ''i'' of the pursuit-evasion game.&lt;/ref&gt; Two rays are equivalent if and only if they define the same haven, so the ends of a graph are in one-to-one correspondence with its havens of order ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Examples==
[[File:Typy kultury organizacyjnej, Ateny II (ubt).svg|thumb|Part of an infinite [[grid graph]], with vertices at the points where two grid lines meet. Despite having many different rays, it has only one end.]]
If the infinite graph ''G'' is itself a ray, then it has infinitely many ray subgraphs, one starting from each vertex of ''G''. However, all of these rays are equivalent to each other, so ''G'' only has one end.

If ''G'' is a forest (that is, a graph with no finite cycles), then the intersection of any two rays is either a path or a ray; two rays are equivalent if their intersection is a ray. If a base vertex is chosen in each connected component of ''G'', then each end of ''G'' contains a unique ray starting from one of the base vertices, so the ends may be placed in one-to-one correspondence with these canonical rays. Every countable graph ''G'' has a [[spanning forest]] with the same set of ends as ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, in the original formulation of this result by {{harvtxt|Halin|1964}} in which ends are defined as equivalence classes of rays, every equivalence class of rays of ''G'' contains a unique nonempty equivalence class of rays of the spanning forest. In terms of havens, there is a one-to-one correspondence of havens of order ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; between ''G'' and its spanning tree ''T'' for which &lt;math&gt;\beta_T(X)\subset \beta_G(X)&lt;/math&gt; for every finite set ''X'' and every corresponding pair of havens &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exist uncountably infinite graphs with only one end in which every spanning tree has infinitely many ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Seymour|Thomas|1991}}; {{harvtxt|Thomassen|1992}}; {{harvtxt|Diestel|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''G'' is an infinite [[grid graph]], then it has many rays, and arbitrarily large sets of vertex-disjoint rays. However, it has only one end. This may be seen most easily using the characterization of ends in terms of havens: the removal of any finite set of vertices leaves exactly one infinite connected component, so there is only one haven (the one that maps each finite set to the unique infinite connected component).

==Relation to topological ends==
In [[point-set topology]], there is a concept of an end that is similar to, but not quite the same as, the concept of an end in graph theory, dating back much earlier to {{harvtxt|Freudenthal|1931}}. If a topological space can be covered by a nested sequence of [[compact set]]s &lt;math&gt;\kappa_0\subset\kappa_1\subset\kappa_2\dots&lt;/math&gt;, then an end of the space is a sequence of components &lt;math&gt;U_0\supset U_1\supset U_2\dots&lt;/math&gt; of the complements of the compact sets. This definition does not depend on the choice of the compact sets: the ends defined by one such choice may be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the ends defined by any other choice.

An infinite graph ''G'' may be made into a topological space in two different but related ways:
*Replacing each vertex of the graph by a point and each edge of the graph by an open [[unit interval]] produces a [[Hausdorff space]] from the graph in which a set ''S'' is defined to be open whenever each intersection of ''S'' with an edge of the graph is an open subset of the unit interval.
*Replacing each vertex of the graph by a point and each edge of the graph by a point produces a non-Hausdorff space in which the open sets are the sets ''S'' with the property that, if a vertex ''v'' of ''G'' belongs to ''S'', then so does every edge having ''v'' as one of its endpoints.
In either case, every finite subgraph of ''G'' corresponds to a compact subspace of the topological space, and every compact subspace corresponds to a finite subgraph together with, in the Hausdorff case, finitely many compact proper subsets of edges. Thus, a graph may be covered by a nested sequence of compact sets if and only if it is locally finite, having a finite number of edges at every vertex.

If a graph ''G'' is connected and locally finite, then it has a compact cover in which the set &amp;kappa;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of vertices at distance at most ''i'' from some arbitrarily chosen starting vertex. In this case any haven &amp;beta; defines an end of the topological space in which &lt;math&gt;U_i=\beta(\kappa_i)&lt;/math&gt;. And conversely, if &lt;math&gt;U_0\supset U_1\supset U_2\dots&lt;/math&gt; is an end of the topological space defined from ''G'', it defines a haven in which &amp;beta;(''X'') is the component containing ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''i'' is any number large enough that &amp;kappa;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; contains ''X''. Thus, for connected and locally finite graphs, the topological ends are in one-to-one correspondence with the graph-theoretic ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Diestel|Kühn|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For graphs that may not be locally finite, it is still possible to define a topological space from the graph and its ends. This space can be represented as a [[metric space]] if and only if the graph has a [[Trémaux tree|normal spanning tree]], a rooted [[spanning tree]] such that each graph edge connects an ancestor-descendant pair. If a normal spanning tree exists, it has the same set of ends as the given graph: each end of the graph must contain exactly one infinite path in the tree.{{sfnp|Diestel|2006}}

==Special kinds of ends==
===Free ends===
An end ''E'' of a graph ''G'' is defined to be a '''free end''' if there is a finite set ''X'' of vertices with the property that ''X'' separates ''E'' from all other ends of the graph. (That is, in terms of havens, &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is disjoint from &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') for every other end ''D''.) In a graph with finitely many ends, every end must be free. {{harvtxt|Halin|1964}} proves that, if ''G'' has infinitely many ends, then either there exists an end that is not free, or there exists an infinite family of rays that share a common starting vertex and are otherwise disjoint from each other.

===Thick ends===
A '''thick end''' of a graph ''G'' is an end that contains infinitely many pairwise-[[disjoint sets|disjoint]] rays. [[Halin's grid theorem]] characterizes the graphs that contain thick ends: they are exactly the graphs that have a [[Homeomorphism (graph theory)|subdivision]] of the [[hexagonal tiling]] as a subgraph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Halin|1965}}; {{harvtxt|Diestel|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special kinds of graphs==
===Symmetric and almost-symmetric graphs===
{{harvtxt|Mohar|1991}} defines a connected locally finite graph to be "almost symmetric" if there exist a vertex ''v'' and a number ''D'' such that, for every other vertex ''w'', there is an [[graph isomorphism|automorphism]] of the graph for which the image of ''v'' is within distance ''D'' of ''w''; equivalently, a connected locally finite graph is almost symmetric if its automorphism group has finitely many orbits. As he shows, for every connected locally finite almost-symmetric graph, the number of ends is either at most two or uncountable; if it is uncountable, the ends have the topology of a [[Cantor set]]. Additionally, Mohar shows that the number of ends controls the [[Cheeger constant (graph theory)|Cheeger constant]]
:&lt;math&gt;h=\inf\left\{\frac{|\partial V|}{|V|}\right\},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' ranges over all finite nonempty sets of vertices of the graph and
where &lt;math&gt;\partial V&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of edges with one endpoint in ''V''. For almost-symmetric graphs with uncountably many ends, ''h''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0; however, for almost-symmetric graphs with only two ends, ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

===Cayley graphs===
[[Image:Cayley graph of F2.svg|right|thumb|The Cayley graph of the [[free group]] on two generators ''a'' and ''b''. The ends of the group are in one-to-one correspondence with the rays (infinite paths) from the identity element ''e'' to the fringes of the drawing.]]
Every [[group (mathematics)|group]] and a set of generators for the group determine a [[Cayley graph]], a graph whose vertices are the group elements and the edges are pairs of elements (''x'',''gx'') where ''g'' is one of the generators. In the case of a [[finitely generated group]], the ends of the group are defined to be the ends of the Cayley graph for the finite set of generators; this definition is invariant under the choice of generators, in the sense that if two different finite set of generators are chosen, the ends of the two Cayley graphs are in one-to-one correspondence with each other.

For instance, every [[free group]] has a Cayley graph (for its free generators) that is a tree. The free group on one generator has a doubly infinite path as its Cayley graph, with two ends. Every other free group has infinitely many ends.

Every finitely generated infinite group has either 1, 2, or infinitely many ends, and the [[Stallings theorem about ends of groups]] provides a decomposition of groups with more than one end.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|last=Stallings|year=1968|year2=1971|txt}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular:
# A finitely generated infinite group has 2 ends if and only if it has a [[cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] of finite [[index of a subgroup|index]].
# A finitely generated infinite group has infinitely many ends if and only if it is either a nontrivial [[free product with amalgamation]] or [[HNN-extension]] with finite amalgamation.
# All other finitely generated infinite groups have exactly one end.

'''GeneMark''' is a generic name for a family of [[Gene_prediction#Ab_initio_approaches|ab initio]] gene prediction programs developed at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Developed in 1993, original GeneMark was used in 1995 as a primary gene prediction tool for annotation of the first completely sequenced bacterial genome of ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', and in 1996 for the first archaeal genome of ''[[Methanococcus jannaschii]]''. The algorithm introduced [[inhomogeneous]] three-periodic [[Markov chain]] models of protein-coding [[DNA sequence]] that became standard in gene prediction as well as Bayesian approach to gene prediction in two DNA strands simultaneously. Species specific parameters of the models were estimated from training sets of sequences of known type (protein-coding and non-coding). The major step of the algorithm computes for a given DNA fragment posterior probabilities of either being "protein-coding" (carrying [[genetic code]])  in each of six possible reading frames (including three frames in [[complementary DNA]] strand) or being "non-coding". Original GeneMark  (developed before the HMM era in Bioinformatics) is an HMM-like algorithm; it can be viewed as approximation to known in the HMM theory posterior decoding algorithm for appropriately defined HMM.

==Prokaryotic gene prediction==

The GeneMark.hmm algorithm (1998) was designed to improve gene prediction accuracy in finding short genes and gene starts. The idea was to integrate the Markov chain models used in GeneMark into a  [[hidden Markov model]] framework, with transition between coding and non-coding regions formally interpreted as transitions between hidden states. Additionally, the [[ribosome]] [[binding site]] model was used to improve accuracy of gene start prediction. Next step was done with development of the self-training gene prediction tool GeneMarkS (2001). GeneMarkS has been in active use by genomics community for gene identification in new prokaryotic genomic sequences.
GeneMarkS+, extension of GeneMarkS integrating  information on homologous proteins into gene prediction is used in the NCBI pipeline for prokaryotic genomes annotation; the pipeline  can annotate up to 2000 genomes daily  ({{URL|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/process | www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/process }}).

==Heuristic Models and Gene Prediction in Metagenomes and Metatransciptomes ==
Accurate identification of species specific parameters of the GeneMark and GeneMark.hmm algorithms was the key condition for making accurate gene predictions. However, the question was raised, motivated by studies of viral genomes, how to define parameters for gene prediction in a rather short sequence that has no large genomic context. In 1999 this question was addressed by development of a "heuristic method" computations of the parameters as functions of the sequence G+C content. Since 2004 models built by the heuristic approach have been used in finding genes in metagenomic sequences.  Subsequently, analysis of several hundred prokaryotic genomes led to developing more advanced heuristic method (implemented in MetaGeneMark) in 2010. 

===Eukaryotic gene prediction===
In eukaryotic genomes modeling of [[exon]] borders with introns and intergenic regions presents a major challenge addressed by use of HMMs. The HMM architecture of eukaryotic GeneMark.hmm includes hidden states for initial, internal, and terminal exons, [[intron]]s, [[intergenic region]]s and single exon genes located in both DNA strands. Initial eukaryotic GeneMark.hmm needed training sets for estimation of the algorithm parameters. In 2005 first version of self-training algorithm GeneMark-ES was developed. In 2008 the GeneMark-ES algorithm was extended to fungal genomes by developing a special intron model and more complex strategy of self-training. Then, in 2014, GeneMark-ET the algorithm that augmented self-training by information from mapped to genome unassembled RNA-Seq reads was added to the family. Gene prediction in eukaryotic transcripts can be done by the new algorithm GeneMarkS-T (2015)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33463">'''Graduate Texts in Mathematics''' ('''GTM''') (ISSN 0072-5285) is a series of [[graduate school|graduate-level]] [[textbooks]] in [[mathematics]] published by [[Springer-Verlag]].  The books in this series, like the other Springer-Verlag mathematics series, are yellow books of a standard size (with variable numbers of pages).  The GTM series is easily identified by a white band at the top of the book.

The books in this series tend to be written at a more advanced level than the similar [[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]] series, although there is a fair amount of overlap between the two series in terms of material covered and difficulty level.

'''Harold Scott MacDonald''' "'''Donald'''" '''Coxeter''', FRS, FRSC, {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC}} (February 9, 1907 &amp;ndash; March 31, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. | last2 = Ivic Weiss | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.2006.0004 | title = Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter. 9 February 1907 – 31 March 2003: Elected FRS 1950 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 52 | pages = 45–66 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British-born Canadian [[geometer]]. Coxeter is regarded as one of the greatest geometers of the 20th century.{{cn|date= August 2018}} He was born in [[London]], received his BA (1929) and PhD (1931) from [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], but lived in [[Canada]] from age 29.  He was always called Donald, from his third name MacDonald.&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; He was most noted for his work on [[regular polytope]]s and higher-dimensional geometries. He was a champion of the classical approach to geometry, in a period when the tendency was to approach geometry more and more via algebra.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Boston Globe]] (September 10, 2006) "[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/09/10/the_man_who_saved_geometry/ Review: ''The Man Who Saved Geometry''] by [[Siobhan Roberts]]. "Crying `Death to Triangles!' a generation of mathematicians tried to eliminate geometry in favor of algebra. Were it not for Donald Coxeter, they might have succeeded"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
In his youth, Coxeter composed music and was an accomplished pianist at the age of 10.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;[[Siobhan Roberts|Roberts, Siobhan]], ''King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, The Man Who Saved Geometry'', Walker &amp; Company, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8027-1499-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that [[mathematics and music]] were intimately related, outlining his ideas in a 1962 article on "Mathematics and Music" in the ''Canadian Music Journal''.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

Coxeter went up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1926 to read mathematics. There he earned his BA (as [[Senior Wrangler]]) in 1928, and his doctorate in 1931.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Coxeter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 he went to [[Princeton University]] for a year as a [[Rockefeller Fellow]], where he worked with [[Hermann Weyl]], [[Oswald Veblen]], and [[Solomon Lefschetz]].&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; Returning to Trinity for a year, he attended [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s seminars on the [[philosophy of mathematics]].&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt; In 1934 he spent a further year at Princeton as a Procter Fellow.&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt;

In 1936 Coxeter moved to the University of Toronto. In 1938 he and [[P. Du Val]], H.T. Flather, and [[John Flinders Petrie]] published [[The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra]] with [[University of Toronto Press]]. In 1940 Coxeter edited the eleventh edition of ''Mathematical Recreations and Essays'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frame, J. S.|title=Review: ''Mathematical Recreations and Essays, 11th edition, by W. W. Rouse Ball; revised by H. S. M. Coxeter|journal=Bull. Amer. Math.

W. Rouse Ball]] in 1892. He was elevated to [[professor]] in 1948. Coxeter was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] in 1948 and a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1950. He met [[M. C. Escher|Maurits Escher]] in 1954 and the two became lifelong friends; his work on geometric figures helped inspire some of Escher's works, particularly the ''Circle Limit'' series based on [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] [[tessellation]]s. He also inspired some of the innovations of [[Buckminster Fuller]].&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; Coxeter, [[M. S. Longuet-Higgins]] and [[J. C. P. Miller]] were the first to publish the full [[list of uniform polyhedra]] (1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked for 60 years at the [[University of Toronto]] and published twelve [[books]].

==Awards==
Since 1978, the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]] have awarded the [[Coxeter–James Prize]] in his honor.

He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1950 and in 1997 he was awarded their [[Sylvester Medal]].&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; In 1990, he became a Foreign Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amacad.org/content/system/search.aspx?s=coxeter Foreign Honorary Member elected 1990] 2016 American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1997 was made a [[Order of Canada#Companion|Companion]] of the [[Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Canadian honour|Type=orc|ID=3762|accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 he received the [[Jeffery–Williams Prize]].&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1239">In mathematics, a '''heptagonal pyramidal number''' is a [[figurate number]] representing the number of dots in a three-dimensional pattern in the shape of a [[heptagon]]al [[pyramid]].&lt;ref name="dd"&gt;{{citation|title=Figurate Numbers|first1=Elena|last1=Deza|first2=M.|last2=Deza|author2-link=Michel Deza|publisher=World Scientific|year=2012|isbn=9789814355483|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDxYdstLPz4C&amp;pg=PA92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In financial markets, '''high-frequency trading''' ('''HFT''') is a type of algorithmic trading characterized by high speeds, high turnover rates, and high order-to-trade ratios that leverages high-frequency financial data and electronic trading tools.&lt;ref name="HFTpracticalguide2013"&gt;{{Citation |last=Aldridge |first=Irene |title=High-Frequency Trading: A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems, 2nd edition |publisher=Wiley |year=2013 |isbn=1-118-34350-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no single definition of HFT, among its key attributes are highly sophisticated algorithms, co-location, and very short-term investment horizons.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''"Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities,"'' §&amp;nbsp;2:31 (Thomson West, 2016–2017 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  HFT can be viewed as a primary form of [[algorithmic trading]] in [[finance]].&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Lin, Tom C.

In 2017, Aldridge and Krawciw&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge, I., Krawciw, S., 2017. Real-Time Risk: What Investors Should Know About Fintech, High-Frequency Trading and Flash Crashes. Hoboken: Wiley. {{ISBN|978-1-119-31896-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that in 2016 HFT on average initiated 10–40% of trading volume in equities, and 10–15% of volume in foreign exchange and commodities. Intraday, however, proportion of HFT may vary from 0% to 100% of short-term trading volume.  Previous estimates reporting that HFT accounted for 60–73% of all US equity trading volume, with that number falling to approximately 50% in 2012 were highly inaccurate speculative guesses.&lt;ref name="advtrade"&gt;Rob Iati, [http://advancedtrading.com/algorithms/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218401501 The Real Story of Trading Software Espionage], ''AdvancedTrading.com'', July 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/high_frequency_algorithmic_trading/index.html Times Topics: High-Frequency Trading], The New York Times, December 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
High-frequency traders move in and out of short-term positions at high volumes and high speeds aiming to capture sometimes a fraction of a cent in profit on every trade.&lt;ref name="whatis" /&gt; HFT firms do not consume significant amounts of capital, accumulate positions or hold their portfolios overnight.&lt;ref name="secletter1" /&gt;  As a result, HFT has a potential [[Sharpe ratio]] (a measure of reward to risk) tens of times higher than traditional [[Buy and hold|buy-and-hold]] strategies.&lt;ref name="howprof"&gt;{{cite news|title=How profitable is high frequency trading|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/irene-aldridge/how-profitable-are-high-f_b_659466.html |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] | first=Irene|last=Aldridge|date=July 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-frequency traders typically compete against other HFTs, rather than long-term investors.&lt;ref name="secletter1"&gt;{{cite news| title=Trade Worx / SEC letters |url=https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-02-10/s70210-129.pdf |date=April 21, 2010 |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jpm"&gt;{{Citation|title=The Microstructure of the Flash Crash: Flow Toxicity, Liquidity Crashes and the Probability of Informed Trading|ssrn= 1695041| author= Easley, David, Marcos Lopez de Prado and Maureen O'Hara| work=[[Journal of Portfolio Management]]|date=October 2010|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vwhft"&gt;{{Citation|last=Vuorenmaa|first=Tommi|last2=Wang|first2=Liang|title=An Agent-Based Model of the Flash Crash of May 6, 2010, with Policy Implications|ssrn= 2336772|work=VALO Research and University of Helsinki|date=October 2013|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HFT firms make up the low margins with incredibly high volumes of trades, frequently numbering in the millions.

== History ==
High-frequency trading has taken place at least since the 1930s, mostly in the form of specialists and pit traders buying and selling positions at the physical location of the exchange, with high-speed telegraph service to other exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=J. W. Milnor and G. A.

This demand is not a theoretical one, for without such service our brokers cannot take advantage of the difference in quotations on a stock on the exchanges on either side of the Atlantic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid-fire computer-based HFT developed gradually since 1983 after NASDAQ introduced a purely electronic form of trading.&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge, I., 2013. High-Frequency Trading: A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems, 2nd edition. Hoboken: Wiley. {{ISBN|978-1-118-34350-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 21st century, HFT trades had an execution time of several seconds, whereas by 2010 this had decreased to [[millisecond|milli]]- and even [[microsecond]]s.&lt;ref name="patience"&gt;{{Citation|title=Patience and Finance| work=[[Bank of England]]|date= Sep 2, 2010|accessdate=Sep 10, 2010| url=http://www.bis.org/review/r100909e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, high-frequency trading was a little-known topic outside the financial sector, with an article published by the ''New York Times'' in July 2009 being one of the first to bring the subject to the public's attention.&lt;ref name="speedPays"&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles|last=Duhigg |title=Stock Traders Find Speed Pays, in Milliseconds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/business/24trading.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 23, 2009|accessdate=Sep 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 2013, [[Italy]] became the world's first country to introduce a tax specifically targeted at HFT, charging a levy of 0.02% on equity transactions lasting less than 0.5 seconds.&lt;ref name=Italy&gt;{{cite news

=== Market growth ===
In the early 2000s, high-frequency trading still accounted for fewer than 10% of equity orders, but this proportion was soon to begin rapid growth. According to data from the NYSE, trading volume grew by about 164% between 2005 and 2009 for which high-frequency trading might be accounted.&lt;ref name="speedPays" /&gt; As of the first quarter in 2009, total assets under management for hedge funds with high-frequency trading strategies were $141 billion, down about 21% from their peak before the worst of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010|crises]],&lt;ref name="mktbeat"&gt;Rogow, Geoffrey, and Eric Ross [https://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2009/06/19/rise-of-the-market-machines/ Rise of the (Market) Machines], ''The Wall Street Journal'', June 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; although most of the largest HFT's are actually LLC's owned by a small number of investors.  The high-frequency strategy was first made popular by [[Renaissance Technologies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olsen.ch/fileadmin/Publications/Archive//hedgefuture.pdf|title=OlsenInvest – Scientific Investing|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225230059/http://www.olsen.ch/fileadmin/Publications/Archive//hedgefuture.pdf|archivedate=25 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who use both HFT and quantitative aspects in their trading. Many high-frequency firms are [[market makers]] and provide liquidity to the market which lowers volatility and helps narrow [[bid-offer spread]]s, making trading and investing cheaper for other market participants.&lt;ref name="mktbeat" /&gt;

=== Market share ===
In the United States in 2009, high-frequency trading firms represented 2% of the approximately 20,000 firms operating today, but accounted for 73% of all equity orders volume.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;ref name="Aite Group Survey"&gt;Aite Group Survey{{dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major U.S. high-frequency trading firms include [[Virtu Financial]], [[KCG Holdings|KCG]], [[Tower Research|Tower Research Capital]], [[IMC Financial Markets|IMC]], [[Tradebot]] and [[Citadel LLC]].&lt;ref name="cutter"&gt;{{cite news |first=James E. |last=Hollis |title=HFT: Boon? Or Impending Disaster?|url=http://www.cutterassociates.com/cutter-advantedge/pdf.cfm?assetid=189|work=[[Nomura Research Institute|Cutter Associates]]|date=Sep 2013 |accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bank of England]] estimates similar percentages for the 2010 US market share, also suggesting that in Europe HFT accounts for about 40% of equity orders volume and for Asia about 5–10%, with potential for rapid growth.&lt;ref name="patience" /&gt; By value, HFT was estimated in 2010 by consultancy ''Tabb Group'' to make up 56% of equity trades in the US and 38% in Europe.&lt;ref name="bandsaw"&gt;{{cite news |first=Justin |last=Grant |title=High-frequency trading: Up against a bandsaw |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b2373a36-b6c2-11df-b3dd-00144feabdc0.html |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=Sep 2, 2010 |accessdate=Sep 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As HFT strategies become more widely used, it can be more difficult to deploy them profitably. According to an estimate from Frederi Viens of [[Purdue University]], profits from HFT in the U.S. has been declining from an estimated peak of $5bn in 2009, to about $1.25bn in 2012.&lt;ref name="timeIsMoney"&gt;{{cite news |first=Clive |last=Cookson |title=Time is money when it comes to microwaves |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2bf37898-b775-11e2-841e-00144feabdc0.html |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=May 12, 2013 |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the percentage of volume attributed to HFT has fallen in the [[equity markets]], it has remained prevalent in the [[futures markets]]. According to a study in 2010 by Aite Group, about a quarter of major global futures volume came from professional high-frequency traders.&lt;ref name="Aite Group Survey" /&gt; In 2012, according to a study by the TABB Group, HFT accounted for more than 60 percent of all futures market volume in 2012 on U.S. exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Polansek|first1=Tom|title=CFTC finalizes plan to boost oversight of fast traders: official|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/23/us-cftc-trading-oversight-idUSBRE97M0ZH20130823|accessdate=8 July 2014|publisher=Reuters|date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies ==
High-frequency trading is [[quantitative trading]] that is characterized by short portfolio holding periods&lt;ref name="practicalguide"&gt;{{Citation |last=Aldridge |first=Irene |title=High-Frequency Trading: A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems |publisher=Wiley |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-470-56376-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; All portfolio-allocation decisions are made by computerized quantitative models. The success of high-frequency trading strategies is largely driven by their ability to simultaneously process large volumes of information, something ordinary human traders cannot do. Specific algorithms are closely guarded by their owners.   Many practical algorithms are in fact quite simple arbitrages which could previously have been performed at lower frequency—competition tends to occur through who can execute them the fastest rather than who can create new breakthrough algorithms.

The common types of high-frequency trading include several types of market-making, event arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, and latency arbitrage.  Most high-frequency trading strategies are not fraudulent, but instead exploit minute deviations from market equilibrium.&lt;ref name="practicalguide" /&gt;

=== Market making ===
{{Main|Market maker}}
According to SEC:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fast Answers – Market Maker|accessdate=August 20, 2016 |url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/mktmaker.htm |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A "market maker" is a firm that stands ready to buy and sell a particular stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price. You'll most often hear about market makers in the context of the [[Nasdaq]] or other "over the counter" (OTC) markets. Market makers that stand ready to buy and sell stocks listed on an exchange, such as the [[New York Stock Exchange]], are called "third market makers." Many OTC stocks have more than one market-maker.

Market-makers generally must be ready to buy and sell at least 100 shares of a stock they make a market in. As a result, a large order from an investor may have to be filled by a number of market-makers at potentially different prices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There can be a significant overlap between a 'market maker' and 'HFT firm'.  HFT firms characterize their business as "Market making – a set of high-frequency trading strategies that involve placing a limit order to sell (or offer) or a buy limit order (or bid) in order to earn the bid-ask spread. By doing so, market makers provide counterpart to incoming market orders. Although the role of market maker was traditionally fulfilled by specialist firms, this class of strategy is now implemented by a large range of investors, thanks to wide adoption of [[direct market access]]. As pointed out by empirical studies&lt;ref name="liquid" /&gt; this renewed competition among liquidity providers causes reduced effective market spreads, and therefore reduced indirect costs for final investors."  A crucial distinction is that true market makers don't exit the market at their discretion and are committed not to, where HFT firms are under no similar commitment.

Some high-frequency trading firms use market making as their primary strategy.&lt;ref name="secletter1" /&gt; Automated Trading Desk (ATD), which was bought by [[Citigroup]] in July 2007, has been an active market maker, accounting for about 6% of total volume on both the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |work=The Associated Press |date=July 2, 2007 |title=Citigroup to expand electronic trading capabilities by buying Automated Trading Desk |accessdate=July 4, 2007 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/02/business/NA-FIN-COM-US-Citigroup-Automated-Trading-Desk.php |publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, [[Citadel LLC]] bought assets of ATD from Citigroup. Building up market making strategies typically involves precise modeling of the target [[market microstructure]]&lt;ref&gt;Cartea, Á. and S. Jaimungal (2012) [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1722202 "Modeling Asset Prices for Algorithmic and High Frequency Trading"]; via SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guilbaud, Fabien and Pham, Huyên, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1871969 "Optimal High Frequency Trading with Limit and Market Orders"] (2011); via SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[stochastic control]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Avellaneda M. and S. Stoikov (2008): High frequency trading in a limit order book", Quantitative Finance, 8(3), 217–224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartea, Á., S. Jaimungal and J. Ricci (2011) : Buy Low Sell High : A High Frequency Trading Perspective. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1964781&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartea, Á. and S. Jaimungal (2012) [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2010417 "Risk Metrics and Fine Tuning of High Frequency Trading Strategies"]; via SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guéant, O., C.-A. Lehalle, and J. Fernandez-Tapia (2013, September). [https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3115 "Dealing with the inventory risk: a solution to the market making problem"], ''Mathematics and Financial Economics'' 4 (7), 477–507; via ''arxiv.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

These strategies appear intimately related to the entry of new electronic venues. Academic study of Chi-X's entry into the European equity market reveals that its launch coincided with a large HFT that made markets using both the incumbent market, NYSE-Euronext, and the new market, Chi-X. The study shows that the new market provided ideal conditions for HFT market-making, low fees (i.e., rebates for quotes that led to execution) and a fast system, yet the HFT was equally active in the incumbent market to offload nonzero positions. New market entry and HFT arrival are further shown to coincide with a significant improvement in liquidity supply.&lt;ref&gt;The studies are available at: Jovanovic, Boyan and Albert J. Menkveld, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1624329 "Middlemen in Limit Order Markets" (abstract/download)], via ''[[Social Science Research Network]]'' (SSRN), June 20, 2016; and Menkveld, Albert J., [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1722924 or https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1722924 "High Frequency Trading and the New-Market Makers" (abstract/download)], ''Journal of Financial Markets'', Vol. 16, May 13, 2013; via SSRN.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Michael Lewis]] book ''[[Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt]]'' discusses high-frequency trading, including the tactics of [[spoofing (finance)|spoofing]], [[layering (finance)|layering]] and quote stuffing, which are all now illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-04-01/weil-on-finance-fbi-hops-on-michael-lewis-bandwagon | title=Weil on Finance: FBI Hops on Michael Lewis Bandwagon | publisher=Bloomberg View | date=1 April 2014 | accessdate=27 August 2015 | author=Weil, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book details the rise of high-frequency trading in the US market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/31/fbi-high-speed-trading_n_5065622.html | title=FBI Investigating High-Frequency Traders: WSJ | publisher=Huffington Post | date=31 March 2014 | accessdate=27 August 2015 | author=Bradford, Harry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/07/inside-murky-world-high-frequency-trading | title=Fast money: the battle against the high frequency traders | publisher=The Guardian | date=7 June 2014 | accessdate=27 August 2015 | author=Smith, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ticker tape trading ===
{{For|other uses|Ticker tape (disambiguation)}}
Much information happens to be unwittingly embedded in market data, such as quotes and volumes. By observing a flow of quotes, computers are capable of extracting information that has not yet crossed the news screens. Since all quote and volume information is public, such strategies are fully compliant with all the applicable laws.

Filter trading is one of the more primitive high-frequency trading strategies that involves monitoring large amounts of stocks for significant or unusual price changes or volume activity. This includes trading on announcements, news, or other event criteria. Software would then generate a buy or sell order depending on the nature of the event being looked for.&lt;ref name="6strats"&gt;{{Citation |work=www.T3Live.com |accessdate=September 15, 2010 |title=The World Of High Frequency Trading: 6 Primary Strategies |url=https://www.fibozachi.com/images/stories/TechniciansCorner/WorldofHFT/t3live%20the%20world%20of%20hft.png }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tick trading often aims to recognize the beginnings of large orders being placed in the market.  For example, a large order from a pension fund to buy will take place over several hours or even days, and will cause a rise in price due to increased [[demand]].  An arbitrageur can try to spot this happening then buy up the security, then profit from selling back to the pension fund.  This strategy has become more difficult since the introduction of dedicated trade execution companies in the 2000s which provide optimal trading for pension and other funds, specifically designed to remove the arbitrage opportunity.

=== Event arbitrage ===
Certain recurring events generate predictable short-term responses in a selected set of securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Gregoriou |editor1-first=Greg N. |title=Handbook of High Frequency Trading |date=2015 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-1280-2362-4 |page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_High_Frequency_Trading.html?id=sfScBAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-frequency traders take advantage of such predictability to generate short-term profits.&lt;ref name=RareEvents&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bozdog, Dragos |author2=Wang, Jim |author3=Khashanah, Khaldoun |author4=Florescu, Ionut |title=Rare Events Analysis of High-Frequency Equity Data |journal=Wilmott Journal |date=July 1, 2011 |pages=74-81 |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2013355 |quote=Stevens Institute of Technology School of Business Research Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistical arbitrage ===
Another set of high-frequency trading strategies are strategies that exploit predictable temporary deviations from stable statistical relationships among securities. [[Statistical arbitrage]] at high frequencies is actively used in all liquid securities, including equities, bonds, futures, foreign exchange, etc. Such strategies may also involve classical arbitrage strategies, such as covered [[interest rate parity]] in the [[foreign exchange market]], which gives a relationship between the prices of a domestic bond, a bond denominated in a foreign currency, the spot price of the currency, and the price of a [[forward contract]] on the currency. High-frequency trading allows similar arbitrages using models of greater complexity involving many more than four securities.

The TABB Group estimates that annual aggregate profits of high-frequency arbitrage strategies exceeded US$21 billion in 2009,&lt;ref name="advtrade" /&gt; although the Purdue study estimates the profits for all high frequency trading were US$5 billion in 2009.&lt;ref name="timeIsMoney" /&gt;

=== Index arbitrage ===
[[Index arbitrage]] exploits [[index tracker]] funds which are bound to buy and sell large volumes of securities in proportion to their changing weights in indices.   If a HFT firm is able to access and process information which predicts these changes before the tracker funds do so, they can buy up securities in advance of the trackers and sell them on to them at a profit.

=== News-based trading ===
Company news in electronic text format is available from many sources including commercial providers like Bloomberg, public news websites, and Twitter feeds. Automated systems can identify company names, keywords and sometimes semantics to trade news before human traders can process it.

=== Low-latency strategies ===
A separate, "naïve" class of high-frequency trading strategies relies exclusively on [[ultra-low latency direct market access]] technology. In these strategies, computer scientists rely on speed to gain minuscule advantages in arbitraging price discrepancies in some particular security trading simultaneously on disparate markets.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Another aspect of [[Low latency (capital markets)|low latency]] strategy has been the switch from [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber optic]] to [[Microwave transmission|microwave]] technology for long distance networking. Especially since 2011, there has been a trend to use microwaves to transmit data across key connections such as the one between [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]]. This is because microwaves travelling in air suffer a less than 1% speed reduction compared to light travelling in a vacuum, whereas with conventional fiber optics light travels over 30% slower.&lt;ref name="timeIsMoney" /&gt;

=== Order properties strategies ===
High-frequency trading strategies may use properties derived from market data feeds to identify orders that are posted at sub-optimal prices. Such orders may offer a profit to their counterparties that high-frequency traders can try to obtain. Examples of these features include the age of an order&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/01/20/identifying-trader-type-pt-2/|title=Creating an HFT Strategy: Identifying Trader Type Pt. 2|first=Kipp|last=Rogers|date=20 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the sizes of displayed orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/02/09/order-size-in-the-hft-era-identifying-trade-type-pt-3/|title=Order Size in the HFT Era: Identifying Trader Type Pt. 3|first=Kipp|last=Rogers|date=9 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking important order properties may also allow trading strategies to have a more accurate prediction of the future price of a security.

== Effects ==
The effects of algorithmic and high-frequency trading are the subject of ongoing research. High frequency trading causes regulatory concerns as a contributor to market fragility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote=This supports regulatory concerns about the potential drawbacks of automated trading due to operational and transmission risks and implies that fragility can arise in the absence of order flow toxicity.|title=High frequency trading and fragility|author=Giovanni Cespa, Xavier Vives|journal=Working Papers Series|publisher=[[European Central Bank]]|issue=2020|date=February 2017|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp2020.en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regulators claim these practices contributed to volatility in the May 6, 2010 Flash Crash{{refn|&lt;ref name=WSJ1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters2 /&gt;}} and find that risk controls are much less stringent for faster trades.&lt;ref name="chicagofed" /&gt;

Members of the financial industry generally claim high-frequency trading substantially improves market liquidity,&lt;ref name="secletter1" /&gt; narrows [[bid-offer spread]], lowers volatility and makes trading and investing cheaper for other market participants.{{refn|&lt;ref name="secletter1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mktbeat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="howhft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradersmagazine.com/news/high-frequency-trading-benefits-105365-1.html?zkPrintable=true|title=Commentary: How High Frequency Trading Benefits All Investors|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hftsmall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/01/20/high-frequency-trading-personal-finance-cboe-flash.html|title=High-Frequency Trading Good For Small Investors: CBOE – Forbes|first=Emily|last=Lambert|date=20 January 2010|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An academic study&lt;ref name="liquid"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Hendershott | first1 =Terrence  | last2 =Jones | first2 =Charles M. | last3 =Menkveldf | first3 =Albert J. | title =Does Algorithmic Trading Improve Liquidity? | journal = Journal of Finance | volume = LXVI | issue = 1 | date = February 2011 | url = http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/hender/Algo.pdf | accessdate = January 30, 2015 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01624.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, for large-cap stocks and in quiescent markets during periods of "generally rising stock prices", high-frequency trading lowers the cost of trading and increases the informativeness of quotes;&lt;ref name="liquid" /&gt;{{rp|31}} however, it found "no significant effects for smaller-cap stocks",&lt;ref name="liquid" /&gt;{{rp|3}} and "it remains an open question whether algorithmic trading and algorithmic liquidity supply are equally beneficial in more turbulent or declining markets. ...algorithmic liquidity suppliers may simply turn off their machines when markets spike downward."&lt;ref name="liquid" /&gt;{{rp|31}}

In September 2011, market data vendor [[Nanex LLC]] published a report stating the contrary. They looked at the amount of quote traffic compared to the value of trade transactions over 4 and half years and saw a 10-fold decrease in efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanex.net/Research/ExhibitA/ExhibitA.html|title=Nanex – Exhibit A|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanex's owner is an outspoken detractor of high-frequency trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nanex's Hunsader Seeks To 'Save' Markets From High-Frequency Trading|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kitconews/2014/02/06/nanexs-hunsader-seeks-to-save-markets-from-high-frequency-trading/|accessdate=11 July 2014|publisher=Forbes|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many discussions about HFT focus solely on the frequency aspect of the algorithms and not on their decision-making logic (which is typically kept secret by the companies that develop them). This makes it difficult for observers to pre-identify market scenarios where HFT will dampen or amplify price fluctuations. The growing quote traffic compared to trade value could indicate that more firms are trying to profit from cross-market arbitrage techniques that do not add significant value through increased liquidity when measured globally.

More fully automated markets such as [[NASDAQ]], Direct Edge, and BATS, in the US, gained market share from less automated markets such as the [[NYSE]]. [[Economies of scale]] in electronic trading contributed to lowering commissions and trade processing fees, and contributed to international mergers and consolidation of [[financial market|financial exchanges]].

The speeds of computer connections, measured in milliseconds or microseconds, have become important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RRNJGNP|title=Business and finance|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=198001836|title=InformationWeek Authors – InformationWeek|publisher=|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition is developing among exchanges for the fastest processing times for completing trades. For example, in 2009 the [[London Stock Exchange]] bought a technology firm called MillenniumIT and announced plans to implement its Millennium Exchange platform&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=London Stock Exchange Group to acquire MillenniumIT for US$30m (£18m) |publisher=London Stock Exchange Group |date=2009-09-16 |url=http://www.lseg.com/media-centre/news/corporate-press-releases/london-stock-exchange-group-acquire-millenniumit-us30m-%C2%A318m |access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they claim has an average latency of 126 microseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Turquoise confirms it is the world's fastest trading platform|publisher=Turquoise|date=2010-10-20|url=http://www.tradeturquoise.com/press/TQ_Latency_Press_Release.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717083852/http://www.tradeturquoise.com/press/TQ_Latency_Press_Release.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows sub-millisecond resolution [[Cryptocurrency#Timestamping|timestamping]] of the [[limit order book|order book]].

=== May 6, 2010 Flash Crash ===
{{Main|2010 Flash Crash}}

The brief but dramatic stock market crash of May 6, 2010 was initially thought to have been caused by high-frequency trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom| last=Braithwaite|title=Watchdogs under pressure on market swings|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/65fdeb0e-5a12-11df-acdc-00144feab49a.html|work=[[Financial Times]]|date= 2010-05-07|accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged to its largest intraday point loss, but not percentage loss,&lt;ref name="wsj101507"&gt;{{cite news|last=Browning|first=E.S.| title=Exorcising Ghosts of Octobers Past|work=The Wall Street Journal|pages=C1–C2|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|date=2007-10-15| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119239926667758592?mod=mkts_main_news_hs_h|accessdate=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in history, only to recover much of those losses within minutes.&lt;ref name=Lauricella1&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704370704575227754131412596?mod=rss_com_mostcommentart] Lauricella, Tom, and McKay, Peter A. "Dow Takes a Harrowing 1,010.14-Point Trip," Online Wall Street Journal, May 7, 2010. Retrieved May 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the crash, several organizations argued that high-frequency trading was not to blame, and may even have been a major factor in minimizing and partially reversing the Flash Crash.&lt;ref name="wsjflashcrash"&gt;Corkery, Michael, [https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2010/09/13/jim-simons-on-flash-crash-high-frequency-traders-saved-the-day/?goback=.gde_86999_member_29971040 "High Frequency Traders Saved the Day"], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', September 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[CME Group]], a large [[futures exchange]], stated that, insofar as stock index futures traded on CME Group were concerned, its investigation had found no support for the notion that high-frequency trading was related to the crash, and actually stated it had a market stabilizing effect.&lt;ref name="cme1"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[CME Group]]|title=What happened on May 6th?|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/31546905/CME-Group-Report-on-the-Flash-Crash| date=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after almost five months of investigations, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (''SEC'') and the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (''CFTC'') issued a joint report identifying the cause that set off the sequence of events leading to the Flash Crash&lt;ref name="flashreport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Findings Regarding the Market Events of May 6, 2010|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2010/marketevents-report.pdf|date=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concluding that the actions of high-frequency trading firms contributed to volatility during the crash.

The report found that the cause was a single sale of $4.1 billion in futures contracts by a mutual fund, identified as [[Waddell &amp; Reed Financial]], in an aggressive attempt to hedge its investment position.&lt;ref name=scannell&gt;{{cite news| first=Kara|last=Scannell|title=Report: Algorithm Set Off 'Flash Crash' Amid Stressed Market|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703859204575525973854203534|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2010-10-01|accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/0,1518,695123,00.html|title=Die Spur führt nach Kansas|first=Marc|last=Pritzke|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=2010-05-17|accessdate= 2010-10-01|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint report also found that "high-frequency traders quickly magnified the impact of the mutual fund's selling."&lt;ref name=WSJ1 /&gt; The joint report "portrayed a market so fragmented and fragile that a single large trade could send stocks into a sudden spiral," that a large mutual fund firm "chose to sell a big number of futures contracts using a computer program that essentially ended up wiping out available buyers in the market," that as a result high-frequency firms "were also aggressively selling the E-mini contracts," contributing to rapid price declines.&lt;ref name=WSJ1 /&gt; The joint report also noted "HFTs began to quickly buy and then resell contracts to each other — generating a 'hot-potato' volume effect as the same positions were passed rapidly back and forth."&lt;ref name=WSJ1 /&gt; The combined sales by Waddell and high-frequency firms quickly drove "the E-mini price down 3% in just four minutes."&lt;ref name=WSJ1 /&gt; As prices in the futures market fell, there was a spillover into the equities markets where "the liquidity in the market evaporated because the automated systems used by most firms to keep pace with the market paused" and scaled back their trading or withdrew from the markets altogether.&lt;ref name=WSJ1 /&gt; The joint report then noted that "Automatic computerized traders on the stock market shut down as they detected the sharp rise in buying and selling."&lt;ref name=NYT1 /&gt; As computerized high-frequency traders exited the stock market, the resulting lack of liquidity "...caused shares of some prominent companies like [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] and [[Accenture]] to trade down as low as a penny or as high as $100,000."&lt;ref name=NYT1 /&gt; While some firms exited the market, high-frequency firms that remained in the market exacerbated price declines because they "'escalated their aggressive selling' during the downdraft."&lt;ref name=vwhft /&gt; In the years following the flash crash, academic researchers and experts from the CFTC pointed to high-frequency trading as just one component of the complex current U.S. market structure that led to the events of May 6, 2010.&lt;ref name="kirilenko"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Kirilenko |first1=Andrei |last2=Kyle |first2=Albert S. |last3=Samadi |first3=Mehrdad |last4=Tuzun |first4=Tugkan |title=The Flash Crash: The Impact of High Frequency Trading on an Electronic Market |publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Granularity and accuracy ==
In 2015 the Paris-based regulator of the 28-nation European Union, the [[European Securities and Markets Authority]], proposed time standards to span the EU, that would more accurately synchronize trading clocks "to within a nanosecond, or one-billionth of a second" to refine regulation of gateway-to-gateway latency time— "the speed at which trading venues acknowledge an order after receiving a trade request." Using these more detailed time-stamps, regulators would be better able to distinguish the order in which trade requests are received and executed, to identify market abuse and prevent potential manipulation of European securities markets by traders using advanced, powerful, fast computers and networks. The fastest technologies give traders an advantage over other "slower" investors as they can change prices of the securities they trade.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-18/regulators-outpace-physicists-in-race-to-catch-flash-boys |title=Regulators Outpace Physicists in Race to Catch the ‘Flash Boys’ |publisher=Bloomberg |date=18 March 2015 |accessdate=20 March 2015 |first=Ben |last=Moshinsky }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks and controversy ==
High-frequency trading comprises many different types of algorithms.&lt;ref name="HFTpracticalguide2013" /&gt; Various studies reported that certain types of market-making high-frequency trading reduces volatility and does not pose a systemic risk,&lt;ref name="secletter1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="howhft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hftsmall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cme1" /&gt;  and lowers transaction costs for retail investors,&lt;ref name=vwhft /&gt;&lt;ref name="liquid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="howhft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hftsmall" /&gt;  without impacting long term investors.&lt;ref name="whatis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="secletter1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hftsmall" /&gt; Other studies, summarized in Aldridge, Krawciw, 2017&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge, I., Krawciw, S., 2017.

Hoboken: Wiley. {{ISBN|1-119-31896-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; find that high-frequency trading strategies known as "aggressive" erode liquidity and cause volatility.

In their joint report on the 2010 Flash Crash, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission|CFTC]] stated that "market makers and other liquidity providers widened their quote spreads, others reduced offered liquidity, and a significant number withdrew completely from the markets"&lt;ref name="flashreport" /&gt; during the flash crash.

She said, "high frequency trading firms have a tremendous capacity to affect the stability and integrity of the equity markets.

In an April 2014 speech, Berman argued: "It's much more than just the automation of quotes and cancels, in spite of the seemingly exclusive fixation on this topic by much of the media and various outspoken market pundits. (...) I worry that it may be too narrowly focused and myopic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Timothy|title=SEC’s Berman: The Data Disputes HFT Narrative|url=http://www.waterstechnology.com/buy-side-technology/analysis/2340339/secs-berman-the-data-disputes-hft-narrative|work=WatersTechnology|publisher=waterstechnology.com|accessdate=July 2, 2014|date=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago Federal Reserve letter of October 2012, titled "How to keep markets safe in an era of high-speed trading", reports on the results of a survey of several dozen financial industry professionals including traders, brokers, and exchanges.&lt;ref name="chicagofed" /&gt; It found that
* risk controls were poorer in high-frequency trading, because of competitive time pressure to execute trades without the more extensive safety checks normally used in slower trades.
* "some firms do not have stringent processes for the development, testing, and deployment of code used in their trading algorithms."
* "out-of control algorithms were more common than anticipated prior to the study and that there were no clear patterns as to their cause."

The [[CFA Institute]], a global association of investment professionals, advocated for reforms regarding high-frequency trading,&lt;ref name="cfa"&gt;{{Citation |title=High-Frequency Trading Investor Issues and Perspectives |url=http://www.cfainstitute.org/ethics/Documents/policy-brief-hft.pdf |publisher=CFA Institute |date=April 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including:
* Promoting robust internal risk management procedures and controls over the [[algorithms]] and strategies employed by HFT firms.
* Trading venues should disclose their fee structure to all market participants.
* Regulators should address [[market manipulation]] and other threats to the integrity of markets, regardless of the underlying mechanism, and not try to intervene in the trading process or to restrict certain types of trading activities.

=== Flash trading ===
Exchanges offered a type of order called a "Flash" order (on NASDAQ, it was called "Bolt" on the Bats stock exchange) that allowed an order to lock the market (post at the same price as an order {{clarify|text=on the other side of the book|date=May 2018}}) for a small amount of time (5 milliseconds).  This order type was available to all participants but since HFT's adapted to the changes in market structure more quickly than others, they were able to use it to "jump the queue" and place their orders before other order types were allowed to trade at the given price.  Currently, the majority of exchanges do not offer flash trading, or have discontinued it. By March 2011, the [[NASDAQ]], [[BATS Global Markets|BATS]], and Direct Edge exchanges had all ceased offering its Competition for Price Improvement functionality (widely referred to as "flash technology/trading").&lt;ref name="direct"&gt;{{cite news |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Jacob |last=Bunge|title=Direct Edge to Stop 'Flashing' Orders on Monday|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703409304576166930877474292 |date=February 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sunshine"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Skjeltorp|first1=Johannes A. |last2=Sojli |first2=Elvira |last3=Tham |first3=Wing Wah |title=Sunshine trading: Flashes of trading intent at the NASDAQ|ssrn=1787418 |publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insider trading ===
On September 24, 2013, the Federal Reserve revealed that some traders are under investigation for possible [[news leak]] and [[insider trading]]. An anti-HFT firm called NANEX claimed that right after the Federal Reserve announced its newest decision, trades were registered in the Chicago futures market within two milliseconds. However, the news was released to the public in Washington D.C. at exactly 2:00 pm calibrated by atomic clock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101056168 | title=News organizations respond to Fed lockup questions | publisher=CNBC | date=24 September 2013 | accessdate=25 September 2013 | last=Javers |first= Eamon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and takes 3.19 milliseconds to reach Chicago at the [[speed of light]] in straight line and ca. 7 milliseconds in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/24/traders-may-have-gotten-last-weeks-fed-news-7-milliseconds-early/ | title=Traders may have gotten last week’s Fed news 7 milliseconds early | publisher=Washington Post | date=24 September 2013 | accessdate=25 September 2013 | author=Irwin, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the conspiracy revolved around using inappropriate time stamps using times from the SIP (consolidated quote that is necessarily slow) and the amount of "jitter" that can happen when looking at such granular timings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ir.virtu.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2013/Study-of-Federal-Reserve-Announcement/default.aspx | title=Study of Federal Reserve announcement | publisher=Virtue Financial | date=25 September 2013 | accessdate=22 December 2016 | author=Unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violations and fines ==

=== Regulation and enforcement ===
In March 2012, regulators fined Octeg LLC, the equities market-making unit of high-frequency trading firm [[Getco LLC]], for $450,000. Octeg violated Nasdaq rules and failed to maintain proper supervision over its stock trading activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-03-22/getco-fined-450-000-for-failing-to-supervise-equity-trading-1- |title=Getco Fined $450,000 for Failing to Supervise Equity Trading |date=March 22, 2012 |first=Nina |last=Mehta |website=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fine resulted from a request by Nasdaq OMX for regulators to investigate the activity at Octeg LLC from the day after the May 6, 2010 Flash Crash through the following December. Nasdaq determined the Getco subsidiary lacked reasonable oversight of its algo-driven high-frequency trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/trading-technology/getco-slapped-with-0k-fine-for-weak-hft-oversight/d/d-id/1265856 |title=Getco Slapped With $450k Fine For Weak HFT Oversight |date=March 26, 2012 |first=Justin |last=Grant |website=Wall Street &amp; Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, regulators fined [[Knight Capital]] $12 million for the trading malfunction that led to its collapse. Knight was found to have violated the SEC's market access rule, in effect since 2010 to prevent such mistakes. Regulators stated the HFT firm ignored dozens of error messages before its computers sent millions of unintended orders to the market. Knight Capital eventually merged with Getco to form [[KCG Holdings]]. Knight lost over $460 million from its trading errors in August 2012 that caused disturbance in the U.S. stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-16/knight-capital-agrees-to-pay-12-million-fine-for-2012-errors |title=Knight Capital Agrees to $12 Million Settlement for 2012 Errors |date=October 16, 2013 |first=Sam |last=Mamudi |website=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, HFT firm Latour Trading LLC agreed to pay a SEC penalty of $16 million. Latour is a subsidiary of New York-based high-frequency trader [[Tower Research|Tower Research Capital LLC]]. According to the SEC's order, for at least two years Latour underestimated the amount of risk it was taking on with its trading activities. By using faulty calculations, Latour managed to buy and sell stocks without holding enough capital. At times, the Tower Research Capital subsidiary accounted for 9% of all U.S. stock trading. The SEC noted the case is the largest penalty for a violation of the [[net capital rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-frequency-trading-firm-latour-agrees-to-pay-16-million-penalty-sec-says-1410964917 |title=High-Frequency Trading Firm Latour to Pay $16 Million SEC Penalty |date=September 17, 2014 |first=Scott |last=Patterson |website=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to increased regulation, some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=Holly|title=Beyond Regulation: A Cooperative Approach to High-Frequency Trading and Financial Market Monitoring|journal=Policy Analysis|date=2015|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa771_2.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=High Frequency Trading Needs Information, Not Regulation|url=http://www.economics21.org/commentary/high-frequency-trading-NASA-CATO-Mikelewis-regulation-hft-flashcrash-10-20-3015|website=Economics21.org|publisher=Manhattan Institute|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that instead of promoting government intervention, it would be more efficient to focus on a solution that mitigates information asymmetries among traders and their backers.

=== Order types ===
On January 12, 2015, the SEC announced a $14 million penalty against a subsidiary of [[BATS Global Markets]], an exchange operator that was founded by high-frequency traders. The BATS subsidiary [[Direct Edge]] failed to properly disclose order types on its two exchanges EDGA and EDGX. These exchanges offered three variations of controversial "Hide Not Slide"&lt;ref name=Bloom20150113&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-01-13/hide-not-slide-orders-were-slippery-and-hidden |title='Hide Not Slide' Orders Were Slippery and Hidden |date=January 12, 2015 |first=Matt |last=Levine |website=Bloomberg View}}&lt;/ref&gt; orders and failed to accurately describe their priority to other orders. The SEC found the exchanges disclosed complete and accurate information about the order types "only to some members, including certain high-frequency trading firms that provided input about how the orders would operate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-2.html |title=SEC Charges Direct Edge Exchanges With Failing to Properly Describe Order Types |date=January 12, 2015 |website=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint was made in 2011 by [[Haim Bodek]].&lt;ref name=Bloom20150113 /&gt;

Reported in January 2015, [[UBS]] agreed to pay $14.4 million to settle charges of not disclosing an order type that allowed high-frequency traders to jump ahead of other participants. The SEC stated that UBS failed to properly disclose to all subscribers of its dark pool "the existence of an order type that it pitched almost exclusively to market makers and high-frequency trading firms". UBS broke the law by accepting and ranking hundreds of millions of orders&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2015/33-9697.pdf "In the Matter of UBS Securities LLC Respondent"], ''sec.gov'', January 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; priced in increments of less than one cent, which is prohibited under Regulation NMS. The order type called PrimaryPegPlus enabled HFT firms "to place sub-penny-priced orders that jumped ahead of other orders submitted at legal, whole-penny prices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-7.html |title=SEC Charges UBS Subsidiary With Disclosure Violations and Other Regulatory Failures in Operating Dark Pool |date=January 15, 2015 |website=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quote stuffing ===
{{Main|Quote stuffing}}
In June 2014, high-frequency trading firm [[Citadel LLC]] was fined $800,000 for violations that included quote stuffing. Nasdaq's disciplinary action stated that Citadel "failed to prevent the strategy from sending millions of orders to the exchanges with few or no executions." It was pointed out that Citadel "sent multiple, periodic bursts of order messages, at 10,000 orders per second, to the exchanges. This excessive messaging activity, which involved hundreds of thousands of orders for more than 19 million shares, occurred two to three times per day."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/marketregulation/NASDAQ/DisciplinaryActions/CDRG_NQ_2014.pdf "Notice of acceptance ..." to Citadel Securities], NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, June 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/05/citadel-fine-finra-idUSL2N0QB2SE20140805 | title=Citadel fined $800,000 by U.S. regulators for trading violations | publisher=Reuters | date=5 August 2014 | accessdate=22 April 2015 | last=McCrank |first= John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spoofing and layering ===
{{Main|Spoofing (finance)|Layering (finance)}}
In July 2013, it was reported that Panther Energy Trading LLC was ordered to pay $4.5 million to U.S. and U.K. regulators on charges that the firm's high-frequency trading activities manipulated [[commodity market]]s. Panther's computer algorithms placed and quickly canceled bids and offers in futures contracts including oil, metals, interest rates and foreign currencies, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-22/panther-coscia-fined-over-high-frequency-trading-algorithms-1- |title=Panther, Coscia Fined Over High-Frequency Trading Algorithms |date=July 22, 2013 |first1=Lindsay |last1=Fortado |first2=Silla |last2=Brush |website=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, Panther's sole owner Michael Coscia was charged with six counts of commodities fraud and six counts of "spoofing". The indictment stated that Coscia devised a high-frequency trading strategy to create a false impression of the available liquidity in the market, "and to fraudulently induce other market participants to react to the deceptive market information he created".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/chicago/press-releases/2014/high-frequency-trader-indicted-for-manipulating-commodities-futures-markets-in-first-federal-prosecution-for-spoofing |title=High-Frequency Trader Indicted for Manipulating Commodities Futures Markets in First Federal Prosecution for Spoofing |date=October 2, 2014 |website=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Market manipulation ===
{{Main|Market manipulation}}
In October 2014, Athena Capital Research LLC was fined $1 million on price manipulation charges. The high-speed trading firm used $40 million to rig prices of thousands of stocks, including [[eBay Inc]], according to U.S. regulators. The HFT firm Athena manipulated closing prices commonly used to track stock performance with "high-powered computers, complex algorithms and rapid-fire trades," the SEC said. The regulatory action is one of the first market manipulation cases against a firm engaged in high-frequency trading. Reporting by Bloomberg noted the HFT industry is "besieged by accusations that it cheats slower investors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-16/athena-to-pay-1-million-in-sec-hft-manipulation-case |title=HFT Firm Fined $1 Million for Manipulating Nasdaq |date=October 16, 2014 |first1=Keri |last1=Geiger |first2=Sam |last2=Mamudi |website=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advanced trading platforms ==
Advanced [[electronic trading platform|computerized trading platforms]] and market gateways are becoming standard tools of most types of traders, including high-frequency traders. Broker-dealers now compete on routing order flow directly, in the fastest and most efficient manner, to the line handler where it undergoes a strict set of risk filters before hitting the execution venue(s). [[Ultra-low latency direct market access]] (ULLDMA) is a hot topic amongst brokers and technology vendors such as [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Credit Suisse]], and [[UBS]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Typically, ULLDMA systems can currently handle high amounts of volume and boast round-trip order execution speeds (from hitting "transmit order" to receiving an acknowledgment) of 10 milliseconds or less.

Such performance is achieved with the use of [[hardware acceleration]] or even full-hardware processing of incoming [[market data]], in association with high-speed communication protocols, such as [[10 Gigabit Ethernet]] or [[PCI Express]]. More specifically, some companies provide full-hardware appliances based on [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] technology to obtain sub-microsecond end-to-end market data processing.

[[Buy side]] traders made efforts to curb predatory HFT strategies. [[Brad Katsuyama]], co-founder of the [[IEX]], led a team that implemented [[THOR (trading platform)|THOR]], a securities order-management system that splits large orders into smaller sub-orders that arrive at the same time to all the exchanges through the use of intentional delays. This largely prevents information leakage in the propagation of orders that high-speed traders can take advantage of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Wolf Hunters of Wall Street |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/magazine/flash-boys-michael-lewis.html |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, after having with [[Intercontinental Exchange Inc.]] and others failed to prevent SEC approval of IEX's launch and having failed to sue as it had threatened to do over the SEC approval, Nasdaq launched a 'speed bump' product of its own to compete with IEX. According to Nasdaq CEO [[Robert Greifeld]] "the regulator shouldn’t have approved IEX without changing the rules that required quotes to be immediately visible". The IEX speed bump—or trading slowdown—is 350-[[microsecond]]s, which the SEC ruled was within the 'immediately visible' parameter. The slowdown promises to [[#Risks and controversy|impede HST ability]] "often [to] [[#Spoofing and layering|cancel dozens]] of orders for every trade they make".&lt;ref&gt;Michaels, Dave, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasdaq-tries-to-appeal-to-investors-lured-by-new-rival-iex-1471213052 "Nasdaq Tries to Appeal to Investors Lured by New Rival IEX" (possibly subscription-only)], Wall Street ''Journal'', August 14, 2016. Retrieved 2016-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the National Best Bid/Offer regulation (NBBO), the effect of speed bumps is highly questionable and may be disadvantaging investors by luring in orders via artificially-delayed quotes.

Outside of US equities, several notable spot foreign exchange (FX) trading platforms--including ParFX&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.automatedtrader.net/articles/exchange-views/144193/life-in-the-slow-lane|title=Life in the slow lane {{!}} Algorithmic Trading Articles &amp; Financial Insight {{!}} Automated Trader|website=www.automatedtrader.net|language=en|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, EBS Market&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-forex-hft-idUSBRE97M0YJ20130823|title=Exclusive: EBS take new step to rein in high-frequency traders|last=Zhou|first=Wanfeng|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Thomson Reuters Matching&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melton|first=Hayden|date=2017-09-25|title=Market mechanism refinement on a continuous limit order book venue: a case study|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3144722.3144729|journal=ACM SIGecom Exchanges|volume=16|issue=1|pages=72–77|doi=10.1145/3144722.3144729}}&lt;/ref&gt;--have implemented their own 'speed bumps' to curb or otherwise limit HFT activity. Unlike the IEX fixed length delay that retains the temporal ordering of messages as they are received by the platform, the spot FX platforms' 'speed bumps' reorder messages so the first message received is not necessarily that processed for matching first. In short, the spot FX platforms' speed bumps seek to reduce the benefit of a participant being faster than others, as has been described in various academic papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Larry|date=March 2013|title=What to Do about High-Frequency Trading|url=http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/full/10.2469/faj.v69.n2.6|journal=Financial Analysts Journal|language=EN|volume=69|issue=2|doi=10.2469/faj.v69.n2.6|issn=0015-198X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Budish|first=Eric|last2=Cramton|first2=Peter|last3=Shim|first3=John|date=2015-11-01|title=The High-Frequency Trading Arms Race: Frequent Batch Auctions as a Market Design Response|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/130/4/1547/1916146|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=130|issue=4|pages=1547–1621|doi=10.1093/qje/qjv027|issn=0033-5533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__FORCETOC__
A '''highly composite number''', also known as an '''anti-prime'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Weisstein | first = Eric | title = Antiprime | url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Antiprime.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a [[Positive number|positive]] [[integer]] with more [[divisor]]s than any smaller positive integer has.  The term was coined by [[Ramanujan]] (1915). However, [[Jean-Pierre Kahane]] has suggested that the concept might have been known to [[Plato]], who set [[5040 (number)|5040]] as the ideal number of citizens in a city as 5040 has more divisors than any  numbers less than it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jean-Pierre|last=Kahane|authorlink=Jean-Pierre Kahane|title=Bernoulli convolutions and self-similar measures after Erdős: A personal hors d'oeuvre|journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|date=February 2015|volume=62|issue=2|pages=136–140}}. Kahane cites Plato's [[Laws (dialogue)|''Laws'']], 771c.&lt;/ref&gt;

The related concept of '''largely composite number''' refers to a positive integer which has at least as many divisors as any smaller positive integer.

The 15,000th highly composite number can be found on Achim Flammenkamp's website. It is the product of 230 primes:

: &lt;math&gt;a_0^{14} a_1^9 a_2^6 a_3^4 a_4^4 a_5^3 a_6^3 a_7^3 a_8^2 a_9^2 a_{10}^2 a_{11}^2 a_{12}^2 a_{13}^2 a_{14}^2 a_{15}^2 a_{16}^2 a_{17}^2 a_{18}^{2} a_{19} a_{20} a_{21}\cdots a_{229},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; is the sequence of successive prime numbers, and all omitted terms (''a''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; to ''a''&lt;sub&gt;228&lt;/sub&gt;) are factors with exponent equal to one (i.e. the number is &lt;math&gt;2^{14}  \times 3^{9}  \times 5^6  \times \cdots \times 1451&lt;/math&gt;). More concisely, it is the product of seven distinct primorials:

: &lt;math&gt;b_0^5 b_1^3 b_2^2 b_4 b_7 b_{18} b_{229},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;b_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[primorial]] &lt;math&gt;a_0a_1\cdots a_n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Prime factorization==
Roughly speaking, for a number to be highly composite it has to have [[prime factor]]s as small as possible, but not too many of the same. By the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], every positive integer ''n'' has a unique prime factorization:

:&lt;math&gt;n = p_1^{c_1} \times p_2^{c_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{c_k}\qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_1 &lt; p_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; p_k&lt;/math&gt; are prime, and the exponents &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; are positive integers.

Any factor of n must have the same or lesser multiplicity in each prime:

:&lt;math&gt;p_1^{d_1} \times p_2^{d_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{d_k}, 0 \leq d_i \leq c_i, 0 &lt; i \leq k&lt;/math&gt;

So the number of divisors of ''n'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;d(n) = (c_1 + 1) \times (c_2 + 1) \times \cdots \times (c_k + 1).\qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, for a highly composite number ''n'',

* the ''k'' given prime numbers ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; must be precisely the first ''k'' prime numbers (2, 3, 5, ...); if not, we could replace one of the given primes by a smaller prime, and thus obtain a smaller number than ''n'' with the same number of divisors (for instance 10&amp;nbsp;= 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;5 may be replaced with 6 = 2 &amp;times; 3; both have four divisors);
* the sequence of exponents must be non-increasing, that is &lt;math&gt;c_1 \geq c_2 \geq \cdots \geq c_k&lt;/math&gt;; otherwise, by exchanging two exponents we would again get a smaller number than ''n'' with the same number of divisors (for instance 18&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; may be replaced with 12&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; both have six divisors).

Also, except in two special cases ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;36, the last exponent ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; must equal&amp;nbsp;1. It means that 1, 4, and 36 are the only square highly composite numbers. Saying that the sequence of exponents is non-increasing is equivalent to saying that a highly composite number is a product of [[primorials]].

Note, that although the above described conditions are necessary, they are not sufficient for a number to be highly composite. For example, 96 = 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; × 3 satisfies the above conditions and has 12 divisors but is not highly composite since there is a smaller number 60 which has the same number of divisors.

==Asymptotic growth and density==
If ''Q''(''x'') denotes the number of highly composite numbers less than or equal to ''x'', then there are two constants ''a'' and ''b'', both greater than 1, such that
:&lt;math&gt;(\log x)^a \le Q(x) \le (\log x)^b \, .&lt;/math&gt;
The first part of the inequality was proved by [[Paul Erd&amp;#337;s]] in 1944 and the second part by [[Jean-Louis Nicolas]] in 1988.  We have&lt;ref name=HBI45&gt;Sándor et al (2006) p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1.13862 &lt; \liminf \frac{\log Q(x)}{\log\log x} \le 1.44 \ &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup \frac{\log Q(x)}{\log\log x} \le 1.71 \ .&lt;/math&gt;

==Related sequences==
Highly composite numbers higher than 6 are also [[abundant number]]s. One need only look at the three largest proper divisors of a particular highly composite number to ascertain this fact. It is false that all highly composite numbers are also [[Harshad number]]s in base 10. The first HCN that is not a Harshad number is 245,044,800, which has a digit sum of 27, but 27 does not divide evenly into 245,044,800.

10 of the first 38 highly composite numbers are [[superior highly composite number]]s.
The sequence of highly composite numbers {{OEIS|id=A002182}} is a subset of the sequence of smallest numbers ''k'' with exactly ''n'' divisors {{OEIS|id=A005179}}.

Highly composite numbers whose number of divisors is also a highly composite number are for n = 1, 2, 6, 12, 60, 360, 1260, 2520, 5040, 55440, 277200, 720720, 3603600, 61261200, 2205403200, 293318625600, 6746328388800, 195643523275200 {{OEIS|id=A189394}}. It is extremely likely that this sequence is complete.

A positive integer ''n'' is a '''largely composite number''' if ''d''(''n'') ≥ ''d''(''m'') for all ''m'' ≤ ''n''.  The counting function ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') of largely composite numbers satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;(\log x)^c \le \log Q_L(x) \le (\log x)^d \ &lt;/math&gt;
for positive ''c'',''d'' with &lt;math&gt;0.2 \le c \le d \le 0.5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=HNTI46&gt;Sándor et al (2006) p.46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nic79&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nicolas | first=Jean-Louis | authorlink=Jean-Louis Nicolas | title=Répartition des nombres largement composés | language=French | zbl=0368.10032 | journal=Acta Arith. | volume=34 | pages=379–390 | year=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the prime factorization of a highly composite number uses all of the first ''k'' primes, every highly composite number must be a [[practical number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4086">In mathematics, the '''inflation-restriction exact sequence''' is an [[exact sequence]] occurring in [[group cohomology]] and is a special case of the [[five-term exact sequence]] arising from the study of [[spectral sequences]].

Specifically, let ''G'' be a [[group (mathematics)|group]], ''N'' a [[normal subgroup]], and ''A'' an [[abelian group]] which is equipped with an action of ''G'', i.e., a [[homomorphism]] from ''G'' to the [[automorphism|automorphism group]] of ''A''. The quotient group ''G''/''N'' acts on 
::''A''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; = { ''a'' &amp;isin; ''A'' : ''na'' = ''a'' for all ''n'' &amp;isin; ''N''}.
: 
Then the inflation-restriction exact sequence is:

::0 &amp;rarr; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''N'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;rarr; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'', ''A'') &amp;rarr; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''N'', ''A'')&lt;sup&gt;''G''/''N''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''N'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;rarr;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'', ''A'')
:

In this sequence, there are maps
* ''inflation'' ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''N'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;rarr; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'', ''A'')
* ''restriction'' ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'', ''A'') &amp;rarr; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''N'', ''A'')&lt;sup&gt;''G''/''N''&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''transgression'' ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''N'', ''A'')&lt;sup&gt;''G''/''N''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''N'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;)
* ''inflation'' ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''N'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;rarr;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'', ''A'')

The inflation and restriction are defined for general ''n'':
* ''inflation'' ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''N'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;rarr; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'', ''A'')
* ''restriction'' ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'', ''A'') &amp;rarr; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''N'', ''A'')&lt;sup&gt;''G''/''N''&lt;/sup&gt;

The transgression is defined for general ''n'' 
* ''transgression'' ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''N'', ''A'')&lt;sup&gt;''G''/''N''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''N'', ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;)
only if ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''N'', ''A'')&lt;sup&gt;''G''/''N''&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 for ''i'' ≤ ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=GS67&gt;Gille &amp; Szamuely (2006) p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence for general ''n'' may be deduced from the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 by dimension-shifting or from the [[Lyndon–Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence]].&lt;ref name=GS68&gt;Gille &amp; Szamuely (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;68&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23824">In [[mathematics]], the '''Laguerre polynomials''', named after [[Edmond Laguerre]] (1834 - 1886), are solutions of '''Laguerre's equation:'''

: &lt;math&gt;xy'' + (1 - x)y' + ny = 0&lt;/math&gt;

which is a second-order [[linear differential equation]]. This equation has nonsingular solutions only if ''n'' is a non-negative integer.

Sometimes the name '''Laguerre polynomials''' is used for solutions of

: &lt;math&gt;xy'' + (\alpha+1 - x)y' + ny = 0~.&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|n}} is still a non-negative integer.
Then they are also named '''generalized Laguerre polynomials''', as will be done here (alternatively '''associated Laguerre polynomials''' or, rarely, '''Sonine polynomials''', after  their inventor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recherches sur les fonctions cylindriques et le développement des fonctions continues en séries|author=[[N. Sonine]]|journal=[[Math. Ann.]]|date=1880|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–80|doi=10.1007/BF01459227|url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PPN=PPN235181684_0016&amp;DMDID=dmdlog8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolay Yakovlevich Sonin]]).

More generally, a '''Laguerre function''' is a solution when {{mvar|n}} is not necessarily a non-negative integer.

The Laguerre polynomials are also used for [[Gaussian quadrature]] to numerically compute integrals of the form

: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty f(x) e^{-x} \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

These polynomials, usually denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;..., are a [[polynomial sequence]] which may be defined by the [[Rodrigues formula#Rodrigues formula|Rodrigues formula]],

:&lt;math&gt;L_n(x)=\frac{e^x}{n!}\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\left(e^{-x} x^n\right) =\frac{1}{n!} \left( \frac{d}{dx} -1 \right) ^n x^n,&lt;/math&gt;

reducing to the closed form of a following section.

They are [[orthogonal polynomials]] with respect to an [[inner product]]
: &lt;math&gt;\langle f,g \rangle = \int_0^\infty f(x) g(x) e^{-x}\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

The sequence of Laguerre polynomials {{math|''n''! L&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[Sheffer sequence]],

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} L_n = \left ( \frac{d}{dx} - 1 \right ) L_{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Rook polynomial]]s in combinatorics are more or less the same as Laguerre polynomials, up to elementary changes of variables. Further see the [[Tricomi–Carlitz polynomials]].

The Laguerre polynomials arise in quantum mechanics, in the radial part of the solution of the [[Schrödinger equation]] for a one-electron atom. They also describe the static Wigner functions of oscillator systems in [[Phase space formulation#Simple harmonic oscillator|quantum mechanics in phase space]]. They further enter in the quantum mechanics of the [[Morse potential]] and of the [[Quantum harmonic oscillator#Example: 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator|3D isotropic harmonic oscillator]].

Physicists sometimes use a definition for the Laguerre polynomials which is larger by a factor of ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt; than the definition used here. Likewise in quantum mechanics the definition for the '''associated Laguerre polynomials''' differs.

== Recursive definition,  closed form, and generating function ==
One can also define the Laguerre polynomials recursively, defining the first two polynomials as

: &lt;math&gt;L_0(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;L_1(x) = 1 - x&lt;/math&gt;

and then using the following [[Orthogonal polynomials#Recurrence relations|recurrence relation]] for any ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1:
: &lt;math&gt;L_{k + 1}(x) = \frac{(2k + 1 - x)L_k(x) - k L_{k - 1}(x)}{k + 1}. &lt;/math&gt;

In solution of some boundary value problems, the characteristic values can be useful:
: &lt;math&gt;L_{k}(0) = 1, L_{k}'(0) = -k.  &lt;/math&gt;

The '''closed form''' is

:&lt;math&gt;L_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}\frac{(-1)^k}{k!} x^k .&lt;/math&gt;

The [[generating function]] for them likewise follows, 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_n^\infty  t^n L_n(x)=  \frac{1}{1-t} e^{-\frac{tx}{1-t}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Polynomials of negative index can be expressed using the ones with positive index:

:&lt;math&gt;L_{-n}(x)=e^xL_{n-1}(-x).&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalized Laguerre polynomials ==
For arbitrary real α the polynomial solutions of the differential equation&lt;ref&gt;A&amp;S p. 781&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x\,y'' + (\alpha +1 - x)\,y' + n\,y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

are called '''generalized Laguerre polynomials''', or '''associated Laguerre polynomials'''.

One can also define the generalized Laguerre polynomials recursively, defining the first two polynomials as

: &lt;math&gt;L^{(\alpha)}_0(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;L^{(\alpha)}_1(x) = 1 + \alpha - x&lt;/math&gt;

and then using the following [[Orthogonal polynomials#Recurrence relations|recurrence relation]] for any ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1:
: &lt;math&gt;L^{(\alpha)}_{k + 1}(x) = \frac{(2k + 1 + \alpha - x)L^{(\alpha)}_k(x) - (k + \alpha) L^{(\alpha)}_{k - 1}(x)}{k + 1}. &lt;/math&gt;

The simple Laguerre polynomials are the special case {{math|''α'' {{=}} 0}} of the generalized Laguerre polynomials:
: &lt;math&gt;L^{(0)}_n(x)=L_n(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Rodrigues formula]] for them is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_n^{(\alpha)}(x) &amp;= {x^{-\alpha} e^x \over n!}{d^n \over dx^n} \left(e^{-x} x^{n+\alpha}\right) \\
&amp;= x^{-\alpha} \frac{( \frac{d}{dx}-1) ^n}{n!}x^{n+\alpha}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[generating function]] for them is
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_n^\infty  t^n L^{(\alpha)}_n(x)=  \frac{1}{(1-t)^{\alpha+1}} e^{-\frac{tx}{1-t}}.&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Zugeordnete Laguerre-Polynome.svg|thumb|center|600px|The first few generalized Laguerre polynomials, ''L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')]]

=== Explicit examples and properties of the generalized Laguerre polynomials ===
* Laguerre functions are defined by [[confluent hypergeometric function]]s and Kummer's transformation as&lt;ref&gt;A&amp;S p.509&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; L_n^{(\alpha)}(x) := {n+ \alpha \choose n} M(-n,\alpha+1,x).&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{n+ \alpha \choose n}&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized [[binomial coefficient]]. When {{mvar|n}} is an integer the function reduces to a polynomial of degree {{mvar|n}}. It has the alternative expression&lt;ref&gt;A&amp;S p.510&lt;/ref&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)= \frac {(-1)^n}{n!} U(-n,\alpha+1,x)&lt;/math&gt;
:in terms of [[confluent hypergeometric function|Kummer's function of the second kind]].

* The closed form for these generalized Laguerre polynomials of degree {{mvar|n}} is&lt;ref&gt;A&amp;S p. 775&lt;/ref&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; L_n^{(\alpha)} (x) = \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i {n+\alpha \choose n-i} \frac{x^i}{i!} &lt;/math&gt;
:derived by applying [[Leibniz rule (generalized product rule)|Leibniz's theorem for differentiation of a product]] to Rodrigues' formula.

* The first few generalized Laguerre polynomials are:

:: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_0^{(\alpha)}(x) &amp;= 1 \\
L_1^{(\alpha)}(x) &amp;= -x + \alpha +1 \\
L_2^{(\alpha)}(x) &amp;= \frac{x^2}{2} - (\alpha + 2)x + \frac{(\alpha+2)(\alpha+1)}{2} \\
L_3^{(\alpha)}(x) &amp;= \frac{-x^3}{6} + \frac{(\alpha+3)x^2}{2} -\frac{(\alpha+2)(\alpha+3)x}{2} +\frac{(\alpha+1)(\alpha+2)(\alpha+3)}{6}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

* The [[coefficient]] of the leading term is (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;;
* The [[constant term]], which is the value at&amp;nbsp;0, is
:: &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha)}(0)= {n+\alpha\choose n} \approx \frac{n^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)};&lt;/math&gt;

* If ''α'' is non-negative, then ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''α'')&lt;/sup&gt; has ''n'' [[real number|real]], strictly positive [[Root of a function|roots]] (notice that &lt;math&gt;\left((-1)^{n-i} L_{n-i}^{(\alpha)}\right)_{i=0}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Sturm chain]]), which are all in the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;\left( 0, n+\alpha+ (n-1) \sqrt{n+\alpha} \right].&lt;/math&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* The polynomials' asymptotic behaviour for large {{mvar|n}}, but fixed {{mvar|α}} and {{math|''x'' &gt; 0}}, is given by&lt;ref&gt;Szegő, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Borwein, J. M. Borwein, R.

:: &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha)}(x) = \frac{n^{\frac{\alpha}{2}-\frac{1}{4}}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \frac{e^{\frac{x}{2}}}{x^{\frac{\alpha}{2}+\frac{1}{4}}} \cos\left(2 \sqrt{nx}- \frac{\pi}{2}\left(\alpha+\frac{1}{2} \right) \right)+O\left(n^{\frac{\alpha}{2}-\frac{3}{4}}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha)}(-x) = \frac{(n+1)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}-\frac{1}{4}}}{2\sqrt{\pi}} \frac{e^{-\frac{x}{2}}}{x^{\frac{\alpha}{2}+\frac{1}{4}}} e^{2 \sqrt{x(n+1)}} \cdot\left(1+O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n+1}}\right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
: and summarizing by
:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{L_n^{(\alpha)}\left(\frac x n\right)}{n^\alpha}\approx e^\frac x {2n}\cdot\frac{J_\alpha\left(2\sqrt x\right)}{\sqrt x^\alpha},&lt;/math&gt; 
:where &lt;math&gt;J_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bessel function#Asymptotic forms|Bessel function]].

=== As a contour integral ===
Given the generating function specified above, the polynomials may be expressed in terms of a [[contour integral]]

: &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_C\frac{e^{-\frac{x t}{1-t}}}{(1-t)^{\alpha+1}\,t^{n+1}} \; dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where the contour circles the origin once in a counterclockwise direction without enclosing the essential singularity at 1

=== Recurrence relations ===
The addition formula for Laguerre polynomials:&lt;ref&gt;A&amp;S equation (22.12.6), p. 785&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha+\beta+1)}(x+y)= \sum_{i=0}^n L_i^{(\alpha)}(x) L_{n-i}^{(\beta)}(y) &lt;/math&gt;.

Laguerre's polynomials satisfy the recurrence relations

:&lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)= \sum_{i=0}^n L_{n-i}^{(\alpha+i)}(y)\frac{(y-x)^i}{i!},&lt;/math&gt;

in particular

: &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha+1)}(x)= \sum_{i=0}^n L_i^{(\alpha)}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)= \sum_{i=0}^n {\alpha-\beta+n-i-1 \choose n-i} L_i^{(\beta)}(x),&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)=\sum_{i=0}^n {\alpha-\beta+n \choose n-i} L_i^{(\beta- i)}(x);&lt;/math&gt;

moreover

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)- \sum_{j=0}^{\Delta-1} {n+\alpha \choose n-j} (-1)^j \frac{x^j}{j!}&amp;= (-1)^\Delta\frac{x^\Delta}{(\Delta-1)!} \sum_{i=0}^{n-\Delta} \frac{{n+\alpha \choose n-\Delta-i}}{(n-i){n \choose i}}L_i^{(\alpha+\Delta)}(x)\\[6pt]
&amp;=(-1)^\Delta\frac{x^\Delta}{(\Delta-1)!} \sum_{i=0}^{n-\Delta} \frac{{n+\alpha-i-1 \choose n-\Delta-i}}{(n-i){n \choose i}}L_i^{(n+\alpha+\Delta-i)}(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

They can be used to derive the four 3-point-rules

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_n^{(\alpha)}(x) &amp;= L_n^{(\alpha+1)}(x) - L_{n-1}^{(\alpha+1)}(x) = \sum_{j=0}^k {k \choose j} L_{n-j}^{(\alpha+k)}(x), \\[10pt]
n L_n^{(\alpha)}(x) &amp;= (n + \alpha )L_{n-1}^{(\alpha)}(x) - x L_{n-1}^{(\alpha+1)}(x), \\[10pt]
&amp; \text{or } \\
\frac{x^k}{k!}L_n^{(\alpha)}(x) &amp;= \sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i {n+i \choose i} {n+\alpha \choose k-i} L_{n+i}^{(\alpha-k)}(x), \\[10pt]
n L_n^{(\alpha+1)}(x) &amp;= (n-x) L_{n-1}^{(\alpha+1)}(x) + (n+\alpha)L_{n-1}^{(\alpha)}(x) \\[10pt]
x L_n^{(\alpha+1)}(x) &amp;= (n+\alpha)L_{n-1}^{(\alpha)}(x)-(n-x)L_n^{(\alpha)}(x);
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

combined they give this additional, useful recurrence relations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)&amp;= \left(2+\frac{\alpha-1-x}n \right)L_{n-1}^{(\alpha)}(x)- \left(1+\frac{\alpha-1}n \right)L_{n-2}^{(\alpha)}(x)\\[10pt]
&amp;= \frac{\alpha+1-x}n  L_{n-1}^{(\alpha+1)}(x)- \frac x n L_{n-2}^{(\alpha+2)}(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a monic polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,
there is the [[partial fraction decomposition]]
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{n!\,L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)}{(\alpha+1)_n} 
&amp;= 1- \sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^j \frac{j}{\alpha + j} {n \choose j}L_n^{(-j)}(x) \\
&amp;= 1- \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{x^j}{\alpha + j}\,\,\frac{L_{n-j}^{(j)}(x)}{(j-1)!} \\
&amp;= 1-x \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{L_{n-i}^{(-\alpha)}(x) L_{i-1}^{(\alpha+1)}(-x)}{\alpha +i}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The second equality follows by the following identity, valid for integer ''i'' and {{mvar|n}} and immediate from the expression of &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of [[Charlier polynomials]]:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{(-x)^i}{i!} L_n^{(i-n)}(x) = \frac{(-x)^n}{n!} L_i^{(n-i)}(x).&lt;/math&gt;
For the third equality apply the fourth and fifth identities of this section.

=== Derivatives of generalized Laguerre polynomials ===
Differentiating the power series representation of a generalized Laguerre polynomial ''k'' times leads to

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^k}{d x^k} L_n^{(\alpha)} (x) = \begin{cases}(-1)^k L_{n-k}^{(\alpha+k)} (x)\text{ if }k\le n\\0\text{ otherwise}\end{cases}.&lt;/math&gt;

This points to a special case ({{math|''α'' {{=}} 0}}) of the formula above: for integer {{math|''α'' {{=}} ''k''}} the generalized polynomial may be written

:&lt;math&gt;L_n^{(k)}(x)=(-1)^k\frac{d^kL_{n+k}(x)}{dx^k},&lt;/math&gt;

the shift by k sometimes causing confusion with the usual parenthesis notation for a derivative.

Moreover, the following equation holds:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{k!} \frac{d^k}{d x^k} x^\alpha L_n^{(\alpha)} (x) = {n+\alpha \choose k} x^{\alpha-k} L_n^{(\alpha-k)}(x),&lt;/math&gt;

which generalizes with [[Antiderivative#Techniques of integration|Cauchy's formula]] to

: &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha')}(x) = (\alpha'-\alpha) {\alpha'+ n \choose \alpha'-\alpha} \int_0^x \frac{t^\alpha (x-t)^{\alpha'-\alpha-1}}{x^{\alpha'}} L_n^{(\alpha)}(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative with respect to the second variable {{mvar|α}} has the  form,&lt;ref&gt;W. Koepf, "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10652469708819127 Identities for families of orthogonal polynomials and special functions.]", ''Integral Transforms and Special Functions 5'', (1997) pp.69-102. (Theorem 10)&lt;/ref&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d \alpha}L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{L_i^{(\alpha)}(x)}{n-i}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is evident from the contour integral representation below.

The generalized Laguerre polynomials obey the differential equation

: &lt;math&gt;x L_n^{(\alpha) \prime\prime}(x) + (\alpha+1-x)L_n^{(\alpha)\prime}(x) + n L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

which may be compared with the equation obeyed by the ''k''th derivative of the ordinary Laguerre polynomial,

: &lt;math&gt;x L_n^{[k] \prime\prime}(x) + (k+1-x)L_n^{[k]\prime}(x) + (n-k) L_n^{[k]}(x)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L_n^{[k]}(x)\equiv\frac{d^kL_n(x)}{dx^k}&lt;/math&gt; for this equation only.

In [[Sturm–Liouville theory|Sturm–Liouville form]] the differential equation is

: &lt;math&gt;-\left(x^{\alpha+1} e^{-x}\cdot L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)^\prime\right)^\prime= n\cdot x^\alpha e^{-x}\cdot L_n^{(\alpha)}(x),&lt;/math&gt;

which shows that {{math|''L''{{su|b=''n''|p=''(α)''}}}} is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue {{mvar|n}}.

=== Orthogonality ===
The generalized Laguerre polynomials are orthogonal over {{math|[0, ∞)}} with respect to the measure with weighting function {{math|''x&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;'' ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AssociatedLaguerrePolynomial.html | title=Associated Laguerre Polynomial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x^\alpha e^{-x} L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)L_m^{(\alpha)}(x)dx=\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)}{n!} \delta_{n,m},&lt;/math&gt;

which follows from

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x^{\alpha'-1} e^{-x} L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)dx= {\alpha-\alpha'+n \choose n} \Gamma(\alpha').&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(x,\alpha+1,1)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the Gamma distribution then the orthogonality relation can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\infty} L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)L_m^{(\alpha)}(x)\Gamma(x,\alpha+1,1) dx={n+ \alpha \choose n}\delta_{n,m},&lt;/math&gt;

The associated, symmetric kernel polynomial has the representations ([[Christoffel–Darboux formula]]){{citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!--All of these formulas require citations.--&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
K_n^{(\alpha)}(x,y) &amp;:= \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)} \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{L_i^{(\alpha)}(x) L_i^{(\alpha)}(y)}{{\alpha+i \choose i}}\\
&amp;{=}\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)} \frac{L_n^{(\alpha)}(x) L_{n+1}^{(\alpha)}(y) - L_{n+1}^{(\alpha)}(x) L_n^{(\alpha)}(y)}{\frac{x-y}{n+1} {n+\alpha \choose n}} \\
&amp;{=}\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)}\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{x^i}{i!} \frac{L_{n-i}^{(\alpha+i)}(x) L_{n-i}^{(\alpha+i+1)}(y)}{{\alpha+n \choose n}{n \choose i}};
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

recursively

: &lt;math&gt;K_n^{(\alpha)}(x,y)=\frac{y}{\alpha+1} K_{n-1}^{(\alpha+1)}(x,y)+ \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)} \frac{L_n^{(\alpha+1)}(x) L_n^{(\alpha)}(y)}{{\alpha+n \choose n}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover,{{clarify|post-text=Limit as n goes to infinity?|date=January 2016}}

: &lt;math&gt;y^\alpha e^{-y} K_n^{(\alpha)}(\cdot, y) \to \delta(y- \cdot).&lt;/math&gt;

[[Turán's inequalities]] can be derived here, which is

: &lt;math&gt;L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)^2- L_{n-1}^{(\alpha)}(x) L_{n+1}^{(\alpha)}(x)= \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{{\alpha+n-1\choose n-k}}{n{n\choose k}} L_k^{(\alpha-1)}(x)^2&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

The following integral is needed in the quantum mechanical treatment of the [[Hydrogen atom#Wavefunction|hydrogen atom]],

: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\infty}x^{\alpha+1} e^{-x} \left[L_n^{(\alpha)} (x)\right]^2 dx= \frac{(n+\alpha)!}{n!}(2n+\alpha+1).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Series expansions ===
Let a function have the (formal) series expansion

: &lt;math&gt;f(x)= \sum_{i=0}^\infty f_i^{(\alpha)} L_i^{(\alpha)}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Then

: &lt;math&gt;f_i^{(\alpha)}=\int_0^\infty \frac{L_i^{(\alpha)}(x)}{{i+ \alpha \choose i}} \cdot \frac{x^\alpha e^{-x}}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)} \cdot f(x) \,dx .&lt;/math&gt;

The series converges in the associated [[Hilbert space]] [[Lp space|{{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[0, ∞)}}]] [[if and only if]]

: &lt;math&gt;\| f \|_{L^2}^2 := \int_0^\infty \frac{x^\alpha e^{-x}}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)} | f(x)|^2 dx = \sum_{i=0}^\infty {i+\alpha \choose i} |f_i^{(\alpha)}|^2 &lt; \infty. &lt;/math&gt;

==== Further examples of expansions====
[[Monomial]]s are represented as

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^n}{n!}= \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i {n+ \alpha \choose n-i} L_i^{(\alpha)}(x),&lt;/math&gt;

while [[binomial coefficient|binomials]] have the parametrization

: &lt;math&gt;{n+x \choose n}= \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{\alpha^i}{i!} L_{n-i}^{(x+i)}(\alpha).&lt;/math&gt;

This leads directly to

: &lt;math&gt;e^{-\gamma x}= \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{\gamma^i}{(1+\gamma)^{i+\alpha+1}} L_i^{(\alpha)}(x) \qquad \text{convergent iff } \Re(\gamma) &gt; -\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

for the exponential function. The [[incomplete gamma function]] has the representation

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(\alpha,x)=x^\alpha e^{-x} \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{L_i^{(\alpha)}(x)}{1+i} \qquad \left(\Re(\alpha)&gt;-1 , x &gt; 0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

== Associated Laguerre Polynomial (Quantum Mechanics) ==
In quantum mechanics the associated Laguerre polynomial is a component of the radial part of the schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry|last=Ratner, Schatz|first=Mark A., George C.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2001|isbn=|location=0-13-895491-7|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The associated Laguerre polynomial is defined as

&lt;math&gt;L^m_n(x) = \frac{d^m}{dx^m}L_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The chemistry maths book|last=1937-|first=Steiner, Erich|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781613441145|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=743217755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiplication theorems==
[[Arthur Erdélyi|Erdélyi]] gives the following two [[multiplication theorem]]s &lt;ref&gt;C. Truesdell, "[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/36/12/752.pdf On the Addition and Multiplication Theorems for the Special Functions]", ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mathematics'', (1950) pp.752-757.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t^{n+1+\alpha} e^{(1-t) z} L_n^{(\alpha)}(z t)=\sum_{k=n} {k \choose n}\left(1-\frac 1 t\right)^{k-n} L_k^{(\alpha)}(z),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e^{(1-t)z} L_n^{(\alpha)}(z t)=\sum_{k=0} \frac{(1-t)^k z^k}{k!}L_n^{(\alpha+k)}(z).&lt;/math&gt;

== Relation to Hermite polynomials ==
The generalized Laguerre polynomials are related to the [[Hermite polynomial]]s:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_{2n}(x) &amp;= (-1)^n 2^{2n} n! L_n^{(-1/2)} (x^2) \\
H_{2n+1}(x) &amp;= (-1)^n 2^{2n+1} n! x L_n^{(1/2)} (x^2)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are the [[Hermite polynomial]]s based on the weighting function exp(−''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the so-called "physicist's version."

Because of this, the generalized Laguerre polynomials arise in the treatment of the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]].

== Relation to hypergeometric functions ==
The Laguerre polynomials may be defined in terms of [[hypergeometric function]]s, specifically the [[confluent hypergeometric function]]s, as

: &lt;math&gt;L^{(\alpha)}_n(x) = {n+\alpha \choose n} M(-n,\alpha+1,x) =\frac{(\alpha+1)_n} {n!}  \,_1F_1(-n,\alpha+1,x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(a)_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Pochhammer symbol]] (which in this case represents the rising factorial).

== Hardy-Hille formula ==
The generalized Laguerre polynomials satisfy the Hardy-Hille formula&lt;ref&gt;Szegő, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. A. Al-Salam (1964), [https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.dmj/1077375084 "Operational representations for Laguerre and other polynomials"], ''Duke Math J.'' '''31''' (1): 127-142.&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{n!\,\Gamma\left(\alpha + 1\right)}{\Gamma\left(n+\alpha+1\right)}L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)L_n^{(\alpha)}(y)t^n=\frac{1}{(1-t)^{\alpha + 1}}e^{-\frac{(x+y)t}{1-t}}\,_0F_1\left(;\alpha + 1;\frac{xyt}{(1-t)^2}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where the series on the left converges for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|t|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Using the identity
: &lt;math&gt;\,_0F_1(;\alpha + 1;z)=\,\Gamma\left(\alpha + 1\right)z^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}}I_{\alpha}\left(2\sqrt{z}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
(see [[Generalized hypergeometric function#The series 0F1|generalized hypergeometric function]]), this can also be written as
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{n!}{\Gamma\left(1+\alpha+n\right)}L_{n}^{(\alpha)}(x)L_{n}^{(\alpha)}(y)t^{n}=\frac{1}{\left(xyt\right)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\left(1-t\right)}e^{-\frac{\left(x+y\right)t}{1-t}}I_{\alpha}\left(\frac{2\sqrt{xyt}}{1-t}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This formula is a generalization of the [[Mehler kernel]] for [[Hermite polynomial]]s, which can be recovered from it by using the relations between Laguerre and Hermite polynomials given above.

The maximum common edge subgraph problem on general graphs is [[NP-complete]] as it is a generalization of [[subgraph isomorphism]]: a graph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to a subgraph of another graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the maximum common edge subgraph of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; has the same number of edges as &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. Unless the two inputs &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; to the maximum common edge subgraph problem are required to have the same number of vertices, the problem is [[APX-hard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2723">The '''Office of the Chief Actuary''' is a government agency that has responsibility for actuarial estimates regarding social welfare programs. In Canada, the Office of the Chief Actuary works with the [[Canada Pension Plan]] and the [[Old Age Security]] Program. In the United States, both the [[Social Security Administration]] and the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] have an Office of the Chief Actuary that deals with [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], respectively. A similar agency in the United Kingdom is called the [[Government Actuary's Department]] (GAD).

=== Social Security Administration ===
In the U.S., the Office of the Chief Actuary at the Social Security Administration plans and directs a program of actuarial estimates and analyses relating to SSA-administered retirement, survivors and disability insurance programs and to proposed changes in those programs. It evaluates operations of the [[Retirement Insurance Benefits|Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund]] and the [[Social Security Disability Insurance|Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund]], conducts studies of program financing, performs actuarial and demographic research on social insurance and related program issues, and projects future workloads.

In addition, the Office is charged with conducting cost analyses relating to the [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) program, a general-revenue financed, means-tested program for low-income aged, blind and disabled people. The Office provides technical and consultative services to the Commissioner, to the Board of Trustees of the Social Security Trust Funds, and its staff appears before Congressional Committees to provide expert testimony on the actuarial aspects of Social Security issues.

A '''polygon soup''' is a set of unorganized polygons, typically triangles, before the application of any structuring operation, such as e.g. [[octree]] grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| year=2010 | title=GameDev.net – What's a polygon soup? | url=https://www.gamedev.net/topic/99076-whats-a-polygon-soup/ | author=GameDev.net | accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term must not to be confused with the "PolySoup"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini12.5/nodes/sop/polysoup|title=SideFX.com – PolySoup surface node|author=SideFX.com|year=2013|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; operation available in the 3D package [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]], whose goal is to optimize the storage space needed by some piece of geometry through the reduction of the underlying number of polygon soups used in its representation. This is accomplished by removing redundant data points (e.g. vertices with the same position) without altering the topology or assigned properties of the optimized geometry in relation to the input one. As a result of this optimization, there can be savings in the storage and processing of large polygon meshes. These savings can have a bigger impact the larger the input data is. For instance, fluid simulations, particle simulations, rigid-body simulations, environments, and character models can reach into the millions of polygons for feature films, incurring in large storage and read/write costs. In those cases, reducing the number of polygon soups required to represent such data can lead to important savings in storage use and compute time.{{Explain|reason=|date=August 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8558">In [[physics]], a '''pregeometry''' is a structure from which geometry develops. Some cosmological models feature a pregeometric universe before the Big Bang. The term was championed by [[John Archibald Wheeler]] in the 1960s and 1970s as a possible route to a theory of [[quantum gravity]]. Since [[quantum mechanics]] allowed a metric to fluctuate, it was argued that the merging of gravity with quantum mechanics required a set of more fundamental rules regarding [[Connection (mathematics)|connectivity]] that were independent of [[topology]] and [[dimensionality]]. Where geometry could describe the properties of a known surface, the physics of a hypothetical region with predefined properties, "pregeometry" might allow one to work with deeper underlying rules of physics that were not so strongly dependent on simplified classical assumptions about the properties of space.

No single proposal for pregeometry has gained wide consensus support in the physics community. Some notions related to pregeometry predate Wheeler, other notions depart considerably from his outline of pregeometry but are still associated with it. A 2006 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meschini|title=Geometry, pregeometry and beyond|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|date=August 2006|arxiv=gr-qc/0411053|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2005.01.002|volume=36|pages=435–464|bibcode=2005SHPMP..36..435M}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a survey and critique of pregeometry or near-pregeometry proposals up to that time. A summary of these is given below:

;Discrete spacetime by Hill: A proposal anticipating Wheeler's pregeometry, though assuming some geometric notions embedded in quantum mechanics and [[special relativity]]. A subgroup of [[Lorentz transformations]] with only [[Rational number|rational]] coefficients is deployed. Energy and [[momentum]] variables are restricted to a certain set of rational numbers. Quantum [[wave function]]s work out to be a special case semi-periodical functions though the nature of [[Wave function|wave functions]] is ambiguous since the energy-momentum space cannot be uniquely interpreted.

;Discrete-space structure by Dadic and Pisk: Spacetime as a [[Graph labeling|unlabeled graph]] whose topological structure entirely characterizes the graph. Spatial points are related to [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]. Operators define the creation or annihilation of lines which develop into a [[Fock space]] framework. This discrete-space structure assumes the metric of spacetime and assumes composite geometric objects so it is not a pregeometric scheme in line with Wheeler's original conception of pregeometry.

;Pregeometric graph by Wilson: Spacetime is described by a generalized graph consisting of a very large or infinite set of vertices paired with a very large or infinite set of edges. From that graph emerge various constructions such as vertices with multiple edges, loops, and directed edges. These in turn support formulations of the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metrical]] foundation of space-time.

;Number theory pregeometry by Volovich: Spacetime as a [[Archimedean property|non-Archimedean]] geometry over a field of rational numbers and a finite [[Finite field|Galois field]] where rational numbers themselves undergo quantum fluctuations.

;Causal sets by Bombelli, Lee, Meyer and Sorkin: All of spacetime at very small scales is a [[Causal sets|causal set]] consisting of locally [[finite set]] of elements with a [[partial order]] linked to the notion of past and future in macroscopic spacetime and causality between point-events. Derived from the causal order is the differential structure and the conformal metric of a manifold. A probability is assigned to a [[Causal sets|causal set]] becoming embedded in a manifold; thus there can be a transition from a discrete Planck scale fundamental unit of volume to a classical large scale continuous space.

;Random graphs by Antonsen: Spacetime is described by [[Graph dynamical system|dynamical graphs]] with points (associated with vertices) and links (of unit length) that are created or annihilated according to probability calculations. The parameterization of graphs in a metaspace gives rise to time.

;Bootstrap universe by Cahill and Klinger: An iterative map composed of [[monad (philosophy)|monad]]s and the relations between them becomes a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree-graph]] of nodes and links. A definition of distance between any two monads is defined and from this and probabilistic mathematical tools emerges a three-dimensional space.

;Axiomatic pregeometry by Perez, Bergliaffa, Romero and Vucetich: An assortment of ontological presuppositions describes spacetime a result of relations between objectively existing entities. From presuppositions emerges the topology and metric of [[Minkowski space|Minkowski spacetime]].

;Cellular networks by Requardt: Space is described by a graph with densely entangled sub-clusters of nodes (with differential states) and bonds (either vanishing at 0 or directed at 1). Rules describe the evolution of the graph from a chaotic patternless pre-Big Bang condition to a stable spacetime in the present. Time emerges from a deeper external-parameter "clock-time" and the graphs lead to a natural metrical structure.

;Simplicial quantum gravity by Lehto, Nielsen and Ninomiya: Spacetime is described as having a deeper pregeometric structure based on three dynamical variables, vertices of an [[abstract simplicial complex]], and a real-valued field associated with every pair of vertices; the abstract simplicial complex is set to correspond with a geometric simplicial complex and then geometric simplices are stitched together into a piecewise linear space. Developed further, triangulation, link distance, a piecewise linear manifold, and a spacetime metric arise. Further, a [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice]] quantization is formulated resulting in a quantum gravity description of spacetime.

;Quantum automaton universe by Jaroszkiewicz and Eakins: Event states (elementary or entangled) are provided topological relationships via tests ([[Hermitian adjoint|Hermitian operators]]) endowing the event states with evolution, irreversible acquisition of information, and a [[Arrow of time#The quantum arrow of time|quantum arrow of time]]. Information content in various ages of the universe modifies the tests so the universe acts as an automaton, modifying its structure. Causal set theory is then worked out within this quantum automaton framework to describe a spacetime that inherits the assumptions of geometry within standard quantum mechanics.

;Rational-number spacetime by Horzela, Kapuscik, Kempczynski and Uzes: A preliminary investigation into how all events might be mapped with rational number coordinates and how this might help to better understand a discrete spacetime framework.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26370">'''Quantum error correction''' ('''QEC''') is used in [[Quantum computer|quantum computing]] to protect [[quantum information]] from errors due to [[decoherence]] and other  [[quantum noise]].  Quantum error correction is essential if one is to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation that can deal not only with noise on stored quantum information, but also with faulty quantum gates, faulty quantum preparation, and faulty measurements.

Classical [[error correction]] employs [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]]. The simplest way is to store the information multiple times, and—if these copies are later found to disagree—just take a majority vote; e.g. 
Suppose we copy a bit three times. Suppose further that a noisy error corrupts the three-bit state so that one bit is equal to zero but the other two are equal to one. If we assume that noisy errors are independent and occur with some probability p, it is most likely that the error is a single-bit error and the transmitted message is three ones. It is possible that a double-bit error occurs and the transmitted message is equal to three zeros, but this outcome is less likely than the above outcome.

Copying quantum information is not possible due to the [[no-cloning theorem]]. This theorem seems to present an obstacle to formulating a theory of quantum error correction. But it is possible to ''spread'' the information of one [[qubit]] onto a highly entangled state of several (''physical'') qubits. [[Peter Shor]] first discovered this method of formulating a ''quantum error correcting code'' by storing the information of one qubit onto a highly entangled state of nine qubits. A quantum error correcting code protects quantum information against errors of a limited form.

Classical error correcting codes use a ''syndrome measurement'' to diagnose which error corrupts an encoded state. We then reverse an error by applying a corrective operation based on the syndrome. Quantum error correction also employs syndrome measurements. We perform a multi-qubit measurement that does not disturb the quantum information in the encoded state but retrieves information about the error. A syndrome measurement can determine whether a qubit has been corrupted, and if so, which one. What is more, the outcome of this operation (the ''syndrome'') tells us not only which physical qubit was affected, but also, in which of several possible ways it was affected.  The latter is counter-intuitive at first sight: Since noise is arbitrary, how can the effect of noise be one of only few distinct possibilities? In most codes, the effect is either a bit flip, or a sign (of the [[phase (waves)|phase]]) flip, or both (corresponding to the [[Pauli matrices]] ''X'', ''Z'', and ''Y''). The reason is that the measurement of the syndrome has the [[projection (linear algebra)|projective]] effect of a [[quantum measurement]]. So even if the error due to the noise was arbitrary, it can be expressed as a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] operations—the ''error basis'' (which is here given by the Pauli matrices and the [[identity (mathematics)|identity]]).  
The syndrome measurement "forces" the qubit to "decide" for a certain specific "Pauli error" to "have happened", and the syndrome tells us which, so that we can let the same Pauli operator act again on the corrupted qubit to revert the effect of the error.

The syndrome measurement tells us as much as possible about the error that has happened, but ''nothing'' at all about the ''value'' that is stored in the logical qubit—as otherwise the measurement would destroy any [[quantum superposition]] of this logical qubit with other qubits in the [[quantum computer]].

==The bit flip code==

The [[repetition code]] works in a classical channel, because classical bits are easy to measure and to repeat. This stops being the case for a quantum channel in which, due to the [[no-cloning theorem]], it is no longer possible to repeat a single qubit three times. To overcome this, a different method, such as the so-called ''three-qubit bit flip code'', has to be used. This technique uses [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] and syndrome measurements and is comparable in performance with the repetition code.

[[File:Quantum error correction of bit flip using three qubits.svg|350px|thumb|right|[[Quantum circuit]] of the bit flip code]]
Consider the situation in which we want to transmit the state of a single qubit &lt;math&gt;\vert\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; through a noisy channel &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt;. Let us moreover assume that this channel either flips the state of the qubit, with probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, or leaves it unchanged. The action of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt; on a general input &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; can therefore be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E(\rho) = (1-p) \rho + p\ X\rho X&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle = \alpha_0|0\rangle + \alpha_1|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be the quantum state to be transmitted. With no error correcting protocol in place, the transmitted state will be correctly transmitted with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p&lt;/math&gt;. We can however improve on this number by ''encoding'' the state into a greater number of qubits, in such a way that errors in the corresponding ''logical qubits'' can be detected and corrected. In the case of the simple three-qubit repetition code, the encoding consists in the mappings &lt;math&gt;\vert0\rangle\rightarrow\vert0_L\rangle\equiv\vert000\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vert1\rangle\rightarrow\vert1_L\rangle\equiv\vert111\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The input state &lt;math&gt;\vert\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is encoded into the state &lt;math&gt;\vert\psi'\rangle = \alpha_0 \vert000\rangle + \alpha_1 \vert111\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. This mapping can be realized for example using two CNOT gates, entangling the system with two ancillary qubits initialized in the state &lt;math&gt;\vert0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | author = [[Michael A. Nielsen]] and [[Isaac L. Chuang]]
  | title = Quantum Computation and Quantum Information

  | year = 2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The encoded state &lt;math&gt;\vert\psi'\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is what is now passed through the noisy channel.

The channel acts on &lt;math&gt;\vert\psi'\rangle&lt;/math&gt; by flipping some subset (possibly empty) of its qubits. No qubit is flipped with probability &lt;math&gt;(1-p)^3&lt;/math&gt;, a single qubit is flipped with probability &lt;math&gt;3p(1-p)^2&lt;/math&gt;, two qubits are flipped with probability &lt;math&gt;3p^2(1-p)&lt;/math&gt;, and all three qubits are flipped with probability &lt;math&gt;p^3&lt;/math&gt;. Note that a further assumption about the channel is made here: we assume that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt; acts equally and independently on each of the three qubits in which the state is now encoded. The problem is now how to detect and correct such errors, ''without at the same time corrupting the transmitted state''.

Let us assume for simplicity that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is small enough that the probability of more than a single qubit being flipped is negligible. One can then detect whether a qubit was flipped, ''without also querying for the values being transmitted'', by asking whether one of the qubits differs from the others. This amounts to performing a measurement with four different outcomes, corresponding to the following four projective measurements:[[File:Comparison of fidelities.svg|thumb|419x419px|Comparison of output ''minimum'' fidelities, with (blue) and without (red) error correcting via the three qubit bit flip code. Notice how, for &lt;math&gt;p\le 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, the error correction scheme improves the fidelity.]]&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{align}
    P_0 &amp;=|000\rangle\langle000|+|111\rangle\langle111|, \\
    P_1 &amp;=|100\rangle\langle100|+|011\rangle\langle011|, \\
    P_2 &amp;=|010\rangle\langle010|+|101\rangle\langle101|, \\
    P_3 &amp;=|001\rangle\langle001|+|110\rangle\langle110|.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;This can be achieved for example by measuring &lt;math&gt;Z_1 Z_2&lt;/math&gt; and then &lt;math&gt;Z_2 Z_3&lt;/math&gt;. This reveals which qubits are different from which others, without at the same time giving information about the state of the qubits themselves. If the outcome corresponding to &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; is obtained, no correction is applied, while if the outcome corresponding to &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; is observed, then the Pauli X gate is applied to the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th qubit. Formally, this correcting procedure corresponds to the application of the following map to the output of the channel: 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathcal E_{\operatorname{corr}}(\rho)=P_0\rho P_0 + \sum_{i=1}^3 X_i P_i \rho\, P_i X_i.&lt;/math&gt;Note that, while this procedure perfectly corrects the output when zero or one flips are introduced by the channel, if more than one qubit is flipped then the output is not properly corrected. For example, if the first and second qubits are flipped, then the syndrome measurement gives the outcome &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt;, and the third qubit is flipped, instead of the first two. To assess the performance of this error correcting scheme for a general input we can study the [[Fidelity of quantum states|fidelity]] &lt;math&gt;F(\psi')&lt;/math&gt; between the input &lt;math&gt;\vert\psi'\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and the output &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\operatorname{out}}\equiv\mathcal E_{\operatorname{corr}}(\mathcal E(\vert\psi'\rangle\langle\psi'\vert))&lt;/math&gt;. Being the output state &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\operatorname{out}}&lt;/math&gt; correct when no more than one qubit is flipped, which happens with probability &lt;math&gt;(1-p)^3 + 3p(1-p)^2&lt;/math&gt;, we can write it as &lt;math&gt;[(1-p)^3+3p(1-p)^2]\,\vert\psi'\rangle\langle\psi'\vert + (...)&lt;/math&gt;, where the dots denote components of &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\operatorname{out}}&lt;/math&gt; resulting from errors not properly corrected by the protocol. It follows that &lt;math display="block"&gt;F(\psi')=\sqrt{\langle\psi'\vert\rho_{\operatorname{out}}\vert\psi'\rangle}\ge \sqrt{(1-p)^3 + 3p(1-p)^2}=\sqrt{1-3p^2+2p^3}.&lt;/math&gt;This fidelity is to be compared with the corresponding fidelity obtained when no error correcting protocol is used, which was shown before to equal &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1-p}&lt;/math&gt;. A little algebra then shows that the fidelity ''after'' error correction is greater than the one without for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this is consistent with the working assumption that was made while deriving the protocol (of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; being small enough).

==The sign flip code==
[[File:Quantum error correction of phase flip using three qubits.svg|450px|thumb|right|[[Quantum circuit]] of the phase flip code]]
Flipped bits are the only kind of error in classical computer, but there is another possibility of an error with quantum computers, the sign flip. Through the transmission in a channel the relative sign between &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; can become inverted. For instance, a qubit in the state &lt;math&gt;|-\rangle=(|0\rangle-|1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; may have its sign flip to  &lt;math&gt;|+\rangle=(|0\rangle+|1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The original state of the qubit

&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle = \alpha_0|+\rangle+\alpha_1|-\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

will be changed into the state

&lt;math&gt;|\psi'\rangle = \alpha_0|{+}{+}{+}\rangle+\alpha_1|{-}{-}{-}\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

In the Hadamard basis, bit flips become sign flips and sign flips become bit flips. Let &lt;math&gt;E_\text{phase}&lt;/math&gt; be a quantum channel that can cause at most one phase flip. Then the bit flip code from above can recover &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; by transforming into the Hadamard basis before and after transmission through &lt;math&gt;E_\text{phase}&lt;/math&gt;.

==The Shor code==

The error channel may induce either a bit flip, a sign flip, or both. It is possible to correct for both types of errors using one code, and the Shor code does just that. In fact, the Shor code corrects arbitrary single-qubit errors.

[[File:Shore code.svg|500px|thumb|right|[[Quantum circuit]] of the Shor code]]
Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be a quantum channel that can arbitrarily corrupt a single qubit. The 1st, 4th and 7th qubits are for the sign flip code, while the three group of qubits (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) are designed for the bit flip code. With the Shor code, a qubit state &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle=\alpha_0|0\rangle+\alpha_1|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; will be transformed into the product of 9 qubits &lt;math&gt;|\psi'\rangle=\alpha_0|0_S\rangle+\alpha_1|1_S\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where

: &lt;math&gt;|0_S\rangle=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}(|000\rangle + |111\rangle) \otimes (|000\rangle + |111\rangle
) \otimes (|000\rangle + |111\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;|1_S\rangle=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}(|000\rangle - |111\rangle) \otimes (|000\rangle - |111\rangle) \otimes (|000\rangle - |111\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

If a bit flip error happens to a qubit, the syndrome analysis will be performed on each set of states (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9), then correct the error.

If the three bit flip group (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) are considered as three inputs, then the Shor code circuit can be reduced as a sign flip code. This means that the Shor code can also repair sign flip error for a single qubit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shor code also can correct for any arbitrary errors (both bit flip and sign flip) to a single qubit. If an error is modeled by a unitary transform U, which will act on a qubit &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; can be described in the form

: &lt;math&gt;U=c_0I+c_1\sigma_x+c_2\sigma_y+c_3\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c_3&lt;/math&gt; are complex constants, I is the identity, and the [[Pauli matrices]] are given by

               0&amp;1\\1&amp;0
              \end{matrix} \biggr);&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y=\biggl( \begin{matrix}
               0&amp;-i\\i&amp;0
              \end{matrix} \biggr);&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_z=\biggl( \begin{matrix}
               1&amp;0\\0&amp;-1
              \end{matrix} \biggr)&lt;/math&gt;

If U is equal to I, then no error occurs. If &lt;math&gt;U=\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt;, a bit flip error occurs. If &lt;math&gt;U=\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt;, a sign flip error occurs. If &lt;math&gt;U=i\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; then both a bit flip error and a sign flip error occur. Due to linearity, it follows that the Shor code can correct arbitrary 1-qubit errors.{{Clarify|date=November 2016}}

== Bosonic codes ==
Several proposals have been made for storing error-correctable quantum information in bosonic modes. Unlike a two-level system, an oscillator has infinitely many energy levels in a single physical system. For example, the cat code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cochrane|first=P. T.|last2=Milburn|first2=G. J.|last3=Munro|first3=W. J.|date=1999-04-01|title=Macroscopically distinct quantum-superposition states as a bosonic code for amplitude damping|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.59.2631|journal=Physical Review A|volume=59|issue=4|pages=2631–2634|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.59.2631|arxiv=quant-ph/9809037|bibcode=1999PhRvA..59.2631C}}&lt;/ref&gt; was followed shortly after by Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|arxiv=quant-ph/0008040|authors=Daniel Gottesman, Alexei Kitaev, John Preskill|title=Encoding a qubit in an oscillator}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently by the binomial code.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Marios H.|last2=Silveri|first2=Matti|last3=Brierley|first3=R. T.|last4=Albert|first4=Victor V.|last5=Salmilehto|first5=Juha|last6=Jiang|first6=Liang|last7=Girvin|first7=S. M.|date=2016-07-14|title=New Class of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes for a Bosonic Mode|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.031006|journal=Physical Review X|volume=6|issue=3|pages=031006|doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.6.031006|arxiv=1602.00008|bibcode=2016PhRvX...6c1006M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insight offered by these codes is to take advantage of this redundancy within a single system, rather than to duplicate many two-level qubits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|arxiv=1708.05010|author=Victor V. Albert et al.|title=Performance and structure of single-mode bosonic codes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written in the [[Fock state|Fock]] basis, the simplest binomial encoding is

&lt;math&gt;|0_L\rangle=\frac{|0\rangle+|4\rangle}{\sqrt{2}},\quad |1_L\rangle=|2\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; 

where the subscript L indicates a "logically encoded" state. Then if the dominant error mechanism of the system is the stochastic application of the bosonic lowering operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{a},&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding error states are &lt;math&gt;|3\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Since the codewords involve only even photon number, and the error states involve only odd photon number, errors can be detected by measuring the photon number parity of the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==General codes==
In general, a ''quantum code'' for a [[quantum channel]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; is the state Hilbert space, such that there exists another quantum channel &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; with

&lt;math&gt;
  (\mathcal{R} \circ \mathcal{E})(\rho) = \rho \quad \forall \rho = P_{\mathcal{C}}\rho P_{\mathcal{C}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathcal{C}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[orthogonal projection]] onto &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''correction operation''.

A ''non-degenerate code'' is one for which different elements of the set of correctable errors produce linearly independent results when applied to elements of the code. If distinct of the set of correctable errors produce orthogonal results, the code is considered ''pure''.&lt;ref&gt;A.R.Calderbank E.M.Rains P.W.Shor and N.J.A.Sloane "Quantum Error Correction Via Codes Over GF(4)"IEEE.Transactions on Information Theory,Vol.44,No.4,July 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==

Over time, researchers have come up with several codes:

* [[Peter Shor]]'s 9-qubit-code, a.k.a. the [[Shor code]], encodes 1 logical qubit in 9 physical qubits and can correct for arbitrary errors in a single qubit.
* [[Andrew Steane]] found a code which does the same with 7 instead of 9 qubits, see [[Steane code]].
* [[Raymond Laflamme]] and collaborators found a class of 5-qubit codes which do the same, which also have the property of being [[fault-tolerant]]. A 5-qubit code is the smallest possible code which protects a single logical qubit against single-qubit errors.
* A generalisation of this concept are the [[CSS code]]s, named for their inventors: [[A. R. Calderbank]], [[Peter Shor]] and [[Andrew Steane]]. According to the quantum Hamming bound, encoding a single logical qubit and providing for arbitrary error correction in a single qubit requires a minimum of 5 physical qubits.
* A more general class of codes (encompassing the former) are the [[stabilizer code]]s discovered by [[Daniel Gottesman]] ([https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9604038]), and by [[A. R. Calderbank]], [[Eric Rains]], [[Peter Shor]], and [[N. J. A. Sloane]] ([https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605005], [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9608006]); these are also called [[additive code]]s.
*Two dimensional Bacon-Shor codes are a family of codes parameterized by integers m and n. There are nm qubits arranged in a square lattice. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bacon|first=Dave|date=2006-01-30|title=Operator quantum error-correcting subsystems for self-correcting quantum memories|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.73.012340|journal=Physical Review A|volume=73|issue=1|pages=012340|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.73.012340|arxiv=quant-ph/0506023|bibcode=2006PhRvA..73a2340B}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A newer idea is [[Alexei Kitaev]]'s [[toric code|topological quantum code]]s and the more general idea of a [[topological quantum computer]].
* [[Todd Brun]], [[Igor Devetak]], and [[Min-Hsiu Hsieh]] also constructed the [[entanglement-assisted stabilizer formalism]] as an extension of the standard [[stabilizer formalism]] that incorporates [[quantum entanglement]] shared between a sender and a receiver.

That these codes allow indeed for quantum computations of arbitrary length is the content of the ''threshold theorem'', found by [[Michael Ben-Or]] and [[Dorit Aharonov]], which asserts that you can correct for all errors if you concatenate quantum codes such as the CSS codes—i.e. re-encode each logical qubit by the same code again, and so on, on logarithmically many levels—''provided'' the error rate of individual [[quantum gate]]s is below a certain threshold; as otherwise, the attempts to measure the syndrome and correct the errors would introduce more new errors than they correct for.

As of late 2004, estimates for this threshold indicate that it could be as high as  1-3%,&lt;ref name="Knill04"&gt;{{cite journal

'''Sequential quadratic programming''' ('''SQP''') is an [[iterative method]] for [[nonlinear programming|constrained nonlinear optimization]]. SQP methods are used on [[mathematics|mathematical]] problems for which the [[objective function]] and the constraints are twice [[continuously differentiable]].

SQP methods solve a sequence of optimization subproblems, each of which optimizes a quadratic model of the objective subject to a linearization of the constraints. If the problem is unconstrained, then the method reduces to [[Newton's method]] for finding a point where the gradient of the objective vanishes.  If the problem has only equality constraints, then the method is equivalent to applying [[Newton's method]] to the first-order optimality conditions, or [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions]], of the problem.

==Algorithm basics==
Consider a [[nonlinear programming]] problem of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
\min\limits_{x} &amp; f(x) \\
\mbox{s.t.} &amp; b(x) \ge 0 \\
  &amp; c(x) = 0.
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian for this problem is&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | year=2006|url=http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/book/num-opt.html| title= Numerical Optimization| publisher=Springer.|isbn=0-387-30303-0| author=Jorge Nocedal and Stephen J. Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda,\sigma) = f(x) - \lambda^T b(x) - \sigma^T c(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are [[Lagrange multipliers]].  At an iterate &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt;, a basic sequential quadratic programming algorithm defines an appropriate search direction &lt;math&gt;d_k&lt;/math&gt; as a solution to the [[quadratic programming]] subproblem

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl} \min\limits_{d} &amp; f(x_k) + \nabla f(x_k)^Td + \tfrac{1}{2} d^T \nabla_{xx}^2 \mathcal{L}(x_k,\lambda_k,\sigma_k) d \\
\mathrm{s.t.} &amp; b(x_k) + \nabla b(x_k)^Td \ge 0 \\
  &amp; c(x_k) + \nabla c(x_k)^T d = 0. \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the term &lt;math&gt;f(x_k)&lt;/math&gt; in the expression above may be left out for the minimization problem, since it is constant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14305">In [[finance]], '''statistical arbitrage''' (often abbreviated as ''Stat Arb'' or ''StatArb'') is a class of short-term financial trading strategies that employ [[Mean reversion (finance)|mean reversion]] models involving broadly diversified portfolios of securities (hundreds to thousands) held for short periods of time (generally seconds to days). These strategies are supported by substantial mathematical, computational, and trading platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url =http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9177.html  | title = Hedge Funds: An Analytic Perspective | author=Andrew W. Lo | page=260 | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2010| edition=Revised and expanded | ISBN=0-691-14598-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trading strategy==
[[File:Statistical Arbitrage.png|thumb|Shows a statistical arbitrage strategy on artificial data. The portfolio prices are a result of combining the two stocks.]]
As a trading strategy, statistical arbitrage is a heavily quantitative and computational approach to securities trading. It involves [[data mining]] and statistical methods, as well as the use of automated trading systems.

Historically, StatArb evolved out of the simpler [[pairs trade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Babak |last=Mahdavi Damghani |year=2013|title= The Non-Misleading Value of Inferred Correlation: An Introduction to the Cointelation Model |journal=[[Wilmott]] |volume=2013 |issue=1 |pages=50–61 |doi= 10.1002/wilm.10252}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategy, in which [[stocks]] are put into pairs by fundamental or market-based similarities. When one stock in a pair outperforms the other, the poorer performing stock is bought [[long (finance)|long]] with the expectation that it will climb towards its outperforming partner, the other is sold [[short (finance)|short]]. Mathematically speaking, the strategy is to find a pair of stocks with high correlation, [[cointegration]], or other common factor characteristics. Various statistical tools have been used in the context of pairs trading ranging from simple distance-based approaches to more complex tools such as [[cointegration]] and [[Copula (probability theory)|copula]] concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rad|first=Hossein|last2=Low|first2=Rand Kwong Yew|last3=Faff|first3=Robert|date=2016-04-27|title=The profitability of pairs trading strategies: distance, cointegration and copula methods|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14697688.2016.1164337|journal=Quantitative Finance|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/14697688.2016.1164337|issn=1469-7688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

StatArb considers not pairs of stocks but a portfolio of a hundred or more stocks—some long, some short—that are carefully matched by sector and region to eliminate exposure to [[Beta (finance)|beta]] and other risk factors. Portfolio construction is automated and consists of two phases. In the first or "scoring" phase, each stock in the market is assigned a numeric score or rank that reflects its desirability; high scores indicate stocks that should be held long and low scores indicate stocks that are candidates for shorting. The details of the scoring formula vary and are highly proprietary, but, generally (as in pairs trading), they involve a short term mean reversion principle so that, e.g., stocks that have done unusually well in the past week receive low scores and stocks that have underperformed receive high scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/Lecture8Risk2011.pdf |last=Avellaneda |first=Marco | title=Risk and Portfolio Management; Statistical Arbitrage | publisher =[[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] | date=Spring 2011 | accessdate=2015-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the second or "risk reduction" phase, the stocks are combined into a portfolio in carefully matched proportions so as to eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, market and factor risk. This phase often uses commercially available risk models like [[MSCI|MSCI/Barra]]/[http://www.apt.com APT]/[http://www.northinfo.com Northfield]/[http://www.riskinfotech.com Risk Infotech]/[http://www.axioma.com/ Axioma] to constrain or eliminate various risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Andrew Lo (op.cit.) states "the widespread use of standardized factor risk models such as those from MSCI/BARRA or North-field Information Systems ... will almost certainly create common exposures among those managers to the risk factors contained in such platforms"&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, StatArb is actually any strategy that is bottom-up, [[Beta (finance)|beta]]-neutral in approach and uses statistical/econometric techniques in order to provide signals for execution. Signals are often generated through a contrarian mean reversion principle but can also be designed using such factors as lead/lag effects, corporate activity, short-term [[momentum (finance)|momentum]], etc. This is usually referred to{{by whom|date=June 2011}} as a multi-factor approach to StatArb.

Because of the large number of stocks involved, the high portfolio turnover and the fairly small size of the effects one is trying to capture, the strategy is often implemented in an automated fashion and great attention is placed on reducing trading costs.

Statistical arbitrage has become a major force at both hedge funds and investment banks. Many bank proprietary operations now center to varying degrees around statistical arbitrage trading.

==Risks==
Over a finite period of time, a low probability market movement may impose heavy short-term losses. If such short-term losses are greater than the investor's funding to meet interim margin calls, its positions may need to be liquidated at a loss even when its strategy's modeled forecasts ultimately turn out to be correct. The 1998 [[default (finance)|default]] of [[Arbitrage#The debacle of Long-Term Capital Management|Long-Term Capital Management]] was a widely publicized example of a fund that failed due to its inability to post collateral to cover adverse market fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = [[When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management]] | last = Lowenstein | first = Roger | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-375-50317-X | publisher = Random House | ref = harv | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical arbitrage is also subject to [[model risk|model weakness]] as well as stock- or security-specific risk. The statistical relationship on which the model is based may be spurious, or may break down due to changes in the distribution of returns on the underlying assets. Factors, which the model may not be aware of having exposure to, could become the significant drivers of price action in the markets, and the inverse applies also. The existence of the investment based upon model itself may change the underlying relationship, particularly if enough entrants invest with similar principles. The exploitation of arbitrage opportunities themselves increases the efficiency of the market, thereby reducing the scope for arbitrage, so continual updating of models is necessary.

On a stock-specific level, there is risk of [[Mergers and acquisitions|M&amp;A activity]] or even default for an individual name. Such an event would immediately invalidate the significance of any historical relationship assumed from empirical statistical analysis of the past data.

==Stat-arb and systemic risk: events of summer 2007==
During July and August 2007, a number of StatArb (and other Quant type) [[hedge fund]]s experienced significant losses at the same time, which is difficult to explain unless there was a common risk factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Babak |last=Mahdavi Damghani |year=2012|title=The Misleading Value of Measured Correlation |journal=[[Wilmott]] |volume=2012 |issue=1 |pages=64–73 |doi=10.1002/wilm.10167}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the reasons are not yet fully understood, several published accounts blame the emergency liquidation of a fund that experienced capital withdrawals or [[margin call]]s. By closing out its positions quickly, the fund put pressure on the prices of the stocks it was long and short. Because other StatArb funds had similar positions, due to the similarity of their alpha models and risk-reduction models, the other funds experienced adverse returns.&lt;ref name=khandani-lo&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/august07.pdf Amir Khandani and Andrew Lo. ''What Happened to the Quants In August 2007?'']&lt;/ref&gt; One of the versions of the events describes how [[Morgan Stanley]]'s highly successful StatArb fund, PDT, decided to reduce its positions in response to stresses in other parts of the firm, and how this contributed to several days of hectic trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704509704575019032416477138#articleTabs%3Darticle | author=Scott Patterson | title=The Minds Behind the Meltdown | publisher = Wall Street Journal Online | date=2010-01-22 | accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sense, the fact of a stock being heavily involved in StatArb is itself a risk factor, one that is relatively new and thus was not taken into account by the StatArb models. These events showed that StatArb has developed to a point where it is a significant factor in the marketplace, that existing funds have similar positions and are in effect competing for the same returns. Simulations of simple StatArb strategies by Khandani and Lo show that the returns to such strategies have been reduced considerably from 1998 to 2007, presumably because of competition.&lt;ref name=khandani-lo/&gt;

It has also been argued that the events during August 2007 were linked to reduction of liquidity, possibly due to risk reduction by high-frequency [[market maker]]s during that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1288988 Amir Khandani and Andrew Lo. ''What Happened to the Quants in August 2007?: Evidence from Factors and Transactions Data'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide practice==
Statistical arbitrage faces different regulatory situations in different countries or markets. In many countries where the trading security or derivatives are not fully developed, investors find it infeasible or unprofitable to implement statistical arbitrage in local markets.

===China===
In China, quantitative investment including statistical arbitrage is not the mainstream approach to investment. A set of market conditions restricts the trading behavior of funds and other financial institutions. The restriction on short selling as well as the market stabilization mechanisms (e.g. daily limit) set heavy obstacles when either individual investors or institutional investors try to implement the trading strategy implied by statistical arbitrage theory.

The '''surface-to-surface intersection (SSI) problem'''. is a basic problem in [[computer-aided geometric design]]: Given two intersecting [[surface (mathematics)|surfaces]] in R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, compute all parts of the [[intersection curve]]. If two surfaces intersect, the result will be a set of isolated [[Point (geometry)|points]], a set of [[curve]]s, a set of overlapping surfaces, or any combination of these cases.&lt;ref&gt;R. Barnhill, G. Farin, M. Jordan, and B. Piper. Surface/Surface Intersection. Computer Aided Geometric Design, 4:3-16,1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Because exact solutions can be found only for some special surface classes, [[approximation]] methods must be used for the general case.&lt;ref&gt;M.

'''''The Man Who Counted''''' (original [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] title: '''''O Homem que Calculava''''') is a book on [[recreational mathematics]] and curious [[word problem (mathematics education)|word problem]]s by Brazilian writer [[Júlio César de Mello e Souza]], published under the pen name [[Malba Tahan]].  Since its first publication in 1938,&lt;ref name ='Coppe de Oliveira_2007'&gt;Coppe de Oliveira, Cristiane (2007); A sombra do arco-íris: um estudo histórico/mitocrítico do discurso pedagógico de Malba Tahan. These, Univ. de São Paulo (Br), 2007, 171 pp.; p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; the book has been immensely popular in Brazil and abroad, not only among mathematics teachers but among the general public as well.

The book has been published in many other languages, including Catalan, English (in the UK and in the US),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Malba|last=Tahan|title=The Man Who Counted / a collection of mathematical adventures|year=1993|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|translator=Leslie Clark|translator2=Alastair Reid|isbn=0-393-30934-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; German, Italian, and Spanish, and is recommended as a paradidactic source in many countries.  It earned its author a prize from the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Literary Academy]].

==Plot summary==
First published in Brazil in 1949, ''O Homem que Calculava'' is a series of tales in the style of the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'', but revolving around [[mathematical game|mathematical puzzle]]s and curiosities.  The book is ostensibly a translation by Brazilian scholar Breno de Alencar Bianco of an original manuscript by Malba Tahan, a thirteenth-century [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar of the [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] – both equally fictitious.

The first two chapters tell how [[Hanak Tade Maia]] was traveling from [[Samarra]] to Baghdad when he met Beremiz Samir, a young lad with amazing mathematical abilities. The traveler then invited Beremiz to come with him to Baghdad, where a man with his abilities will certainly find profitable employment. The rest of the book tells of various incidents that befell the two men along the road and in Baghdad. In all those events, Beremiz Samir uses his abilities with calculation like a [[wand|magic wand]] to amaze and entertain people, settle disputes, and find wise and just solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems.

In the first incident along their trip (chapter III), Beremiz settles a heated inheritance dispute between three brothers.  Their father had left them 35 camels, of which 1/2 (17.5 camels) should go to his eldest son, 1/3 (11.666... camels) to the middle one, and 1/9 (3.888... camels) to the youngest. To solve the brothers dilemma, Beremiz convinces Hanak to donate his only camel to the dead man's estate. Then, with 36 camels, Beremiz gives 18, 12, and 4 animals to the three heirs, making all of them profit with the new share. Of the remaining two camels, one is returned to Hanak, and the other is claimed by Beremiz as his reward.

The translator's notes observe that a variant of this problem, with 17 camels to be divided in the same proportions, is found in hundreds of recreational mathematics books, such as those of E. Fourrey (1949) and G. Boucheny (1939).  However, the 17-camel version leaves only one camel at the end, with no net profit for the estate's executor.

At the end of the book, Beremiz uses his abilities to win the hand of his student and secret love Telassim, the daughter of one of the Caliph's advisers. (The caliph mentioned is [[Al-Musta'sim]], and the time period ends with the [[Abbasid]] dynasty's collapse.)

In the last chapter we learn that Hanak Tade Maia and Beremiz eventually moved to [[Constantinople]], where Beremiz had three sons and Hanak visits him often.

==Publishing history==
The "translator's note" signed "B. A. Bianco" is dated from 1965. The preface signed "Malba Tahan" is dated "Baghdad, 19 of the Moon of Ramadan of 1321".

The 1993 English edition published by W.W. Norton &amp; Co. was illustrated by [[Patricia Reid Baquero]].

The fifty fourth printing by [[Editora Record]] (2001; in Portuguese) contains 164 pages of Malba Tahan's text, plus 60 pages of notes and historical appendices, commented solutions to all the problems, a glossary of Arabic terms, alphabetical index, and other material.

The book was translated into [[Arabic]] in 2005 by Azza Kubba, an Iraqi from Baghdad (published by Al-Jamel Publishing House, Cologne, Germany).

'''Thomas Kipling''' (1745 or 1746 &amp;ndash; 28 January 1822) was a British churchman and academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=KPLN764T|name=Kipling, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[Cambridge University]] in 1764 at age 18 and was [[senior wrangler]] in 1768.  He received an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] in 1771, a [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.D.]] in 1779, and a [[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]] in 1784. He was [[Boyle Lectures|Boyle Lecturer]] in 1792, and [[Temple Church|Master of the Temple]] in 1797.  He was a Deputy [[Regius Professor of Divinity]] from 1787 to 1802, and [[Dean of Peterborough]] from 1798 to 1822.

Kipling was active as a prosecutor against [[William Frend (social reformer)|William Frend]] for the latter's [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] views.

==Life==
Born at [[Bowes, Yorkshire]], he was son of William Kipling, a clock maker. He received his early education at [[Scroton]] and at [[Sedbergh School]], and was admitted a [[sizar]] of St. John's College, Cambridge, on 28 June 1764. He graduated B.A. in 1768, was elected a fellow of his college 29 January 1770, and commenced M.A. in 1771. In 1773 he was elected one of the taxors of the university. He took the degree of B.D. in 1779. In 1782 he was elected Lady Margaret's preacher on the resignation of [[Richard Farmer]]. He was created D.D. in 1784, in which year he was presented by his college to the vicarage of [[Holme on Spalding Moor]], Yorkshire. In 1787 he was appointed deputy regius professor of divinity, the professor, [[Richard Watson (bishop of Llandaff)|Richard Watson]], being in ill-health. In 1792 he preached the Boyle lectures, but did not print the course.{{sfn|Cooper|1892}}

In 1792 Kipling was attacked by liberals in the university for his part in promoting the prosecution of William Frend, Fellow of [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]] who had attacked the established [[Church of England]]. On 10 February 1798 he was made Dean of Peterborough. In the summer of 1802 he resigned the deputy professorship of divinity.{{sfn|Cooper|1892}}

When [[John Lingard]]'s ''Strictures'' on [[Herbert Marsh]]'s ''Comparative View of the Churches of England and Rome'' appeared in 1815, Kipling took offence at the terminology "modern church of England"; and thinking that it came within the category of "seditious words, in derogation of the established religion", wrote to Lingard through the public papers informing him that unless within a reasonable time he published a vindication of his "inflammatory language" he would be indicted. Lingard merely advertised his ''Strictures'' in all the papers which had published Kipling's letter; and the controversy died away.{{sfn|Cooper|1892}} [[Jeremy Bentham]] mentioned a letter of Kipling of 1815 on [[Schism (religion)|schism]] in his ''Church-of-Englandism'' (1817), though a fuller treatment of points he wished to make against Kipling, [[Gerard Andrewes]] and [[Nicholas Vansittart]] was omitted for reasons of length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James E. Crimmins|author2=Catherine Fuller|title=Church-Of-Englandism and Its Catechism Examined|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wVsBdy0slp0C&amp;pg=PR17|accessdate=28 December 2012|date=25 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-959025-4|pages=xvii–xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kipling died at his parsonage, after a lingering illness, on 28 January 1822.{{sfn|Cooper|1892}}

==Works==
Kipling's major work was ''Codex Theodori Bezæ Cantabrigiensis, Evangelia et Apostolorum Acta complectens, quadratis literis, Græco-Latinus. Academia auspicante venerandæ has vetustatis reliquias, summa qua potuit fide, adumbravit, expressit, edidit, Codicis historiam præfixit, notasque adjecit T. Kipling'', Greek and Latin, 2 pts., Cambridge, 1793, printed at the university press. The impression was limited to 250 copies. This edition of the ''[[Codex Bezæ]]'' used types resembling the [[uncial]] characters of the original manuscript. It was criticised in the ''[[Monthly Review (London)|Monthly Review]]'', new ser. xii. 241–6, and by [[Richard Porson]] in two notices in the ''[[British Critic]]'', vol. iii. (1794); and the preface was attacked in a pamphlet entitled ''Remarks on Dr. Kipling's Preface to Beza. Part the first'' (London, 1793), by [[Thomas Edwards (1759?–1842)|Thomas Edwards]] the vicar of [[Histon]] (no second part appeared).&lt;ref&gt;''Admissions to the College of St. John the Evangelist in the University of Cambridge'' vol. 3 (1903), p. 699; [https://archive.org/stream/admissionstocol01goog#page/n709/mode/2up archive.org.]&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in this edition and the bad latinity of the preface were mercilessly censured, so that in the slang of the university a "Kiplingism" came to be synonymous with a grammatical blunder. [[George Horne (bishop)|George Horne]] remarked that Kipling's work, although imperfect, was unfairly underrated. [[Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener]], in the preface to his own edition of the ''Bezæ Codex Cantabrigiensis'' (Cambridge, 1864) defended Kipling's textual work, but not his adopted forms.{{sfn|Cooper|1892}}

Kipling's other works were: {{sfn|Cooper|1892}}

* ‘The Elementary parts of Dr. Smith's Complete System of Optics,’ 1778.
* ‘The Articles of the Church of England proved not to be Calvinistic,’ Cambridge, 1802, which was attacked by a writer under the signature of "Academicus", and drew forth a defence claiming to be by a friend of Kipling, but supposed to be by himself. 
* ‘Certain Accusations brought lately by the Irish Papists against British and Irish Protestants, of every denomination, examined,’ London, 1809; reprinted in ‘The Churchman armed against the Errors of the Time,’ vol. ii. London, 1814. This was elicited by a reprint of [[Thomas Ward (author)|Thomas Ward]]'s ‘Errata of the Protestant Bible.’

'''Tobler's hiking function''' is an [[exponential function]] determining the [[hiking]] speed, taking into account the [[Grade (slope)|slope]] angle.&lt;ref name="Tobler93" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Magyari12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kondo10" /&gt; It was formulated by [[Waldo Tobler]]. This function was estimated from empirical data of [[Eduard Imhof]].&lt;ref name="Imhof50" /&gt;

==Formula==
Walking velocity:

: &lt;math&gt;W=6e^{\displaystyle-3.5\left\vert\frac{dh}{dx}+0.05\right\vert}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dh}{dx}=S=\tan\theta&lt;/math&gt;

where

: ''W'' = walking velocity [km/h]&lt;ref name="Magyari12" /&gt;
: ''dh'' = elevation difference,
: ''dx'' = distance,
: ''S'' = slope,
: ''&amp;theta;'' = angle of slope (inclination).

The velocity on the flat terrain is 5&amp;nbsp;km / h, the maximum speed of 6&amp;nbsp;km / h is achieved roughly at -2.86°.&lt;ref name="Irtenkauf14" /&gt;

On flat terrain this formula works out to 5&amp;nbsp;km/h. For off-path travel, this value should be multiplied by 3/5, for horseback by 5/4.&lt;ref name="Tobler93" /&gt;

== Pace ==
[[Pace (speed)#Running|Pace]] is the reciprocal of speed.&lt;ref name="Kay12_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kay12_2" /&gt; For Tobler's hiking function it can be calculated from the following conversion:&lt;ref name="Kay12_2" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;p=0.6e^{\displaystyle3.5\left\vert m+0.05\right\vert}&lt;/math&gt;

where

: ''p'' = pace [s/m]
: ''m'' = gradient uphill or downhill (''dh/dx = S'' in Tobler's formula),

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14004">'''Tomasulo’s algorithm''' is a [[computer architecture]] hardware [[algorithm]] for dynamic scheduling of instructions that allows [[out-of-order execution]] and enables more efficient use of multiple execution units. It was developed by [[Robert Tomasulo]] at [[IBM]] in 1967 and was first implemented in the [[IBM System/360 Model 91]]’s [[floating point unit]].

The major innovations of Tomasulo’s algorithm include [[register renaming]] in hardware, [[reservation station|reservation stations]] for all execution units, and a common data bus (CDB) on which computed values broadcast to all reservation stations that may need them. These developments allow for improved [[parallel computing|parallel execution]] of instructions that would otherwise stall under the use of [[scoreboarding]] or other earlier algorithms.

[[Robert Tomasulo]] received the [[Eckert–Mauchly Award]] in 1997 for his work on the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Implementation concepts==
[[File:Tomasulo Architecture.png|thumb|right|700px|Tomasulo's floating point unit]]
The following are the concepts necessary to the implementation of Tomasulo's Algorithm:

===Common data bus===
The Common Data Bus (CDB) connects reservation stations directly to functional units. According to Tomasulo it "preserves precedence while encouraging concurrency".&lt;ref name="tomasulo"&gt;
 {{cite journal
 | last1 = Tomasulo | first1 = Robert Marco
 | author1-link = Robert Marco Tomasulo
 | title = An Efficient Algorithm for Exploiting Multiple Arithmetic Units 
 | journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development
 | volume = 11
 | issue = 1
 | pages = 25–33
 | publisher = IBM
 | date = Jan 1967
 | issn = 0018-8646
 | doi = 10.1147/rd.111.0025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}} This has two important effects:
#Functional units can access the result of any operation without involving a floating-point-register, allowing multiple units waiting on a result to proceed without waiting to resolve contention for access to register file read ports. 
#Hazard Detection and control execution are distributed. The reservation stations control when an instruction can execute, rather than a single dedicated hazard unit.

===Instruction order===
Instructions are issued sequentially so that the effects of a sequence of instructions, such as [[exception (computing)|exception]]s raised by these instructions, occur in the same order as they would on an in-order processor, regardless of the fact that they are being executed out-of-order (i.e. non-sequentially). 

===Register renaming===
Tomasulo's Algorithm uses [[register renaming]] to correctly perform out-of-order execution. All general-purpose and reservation station registers hold either a real value or a placeholder value. If a real value is unavailable to a destination register during the issue stage, a placeholder value is initially used. The placeholder value is a tag indicating which reservation station will produce the real value. When the unit finishes and broadcasts the result on the CDB, the placeholder will be replaced with the real value.

Each functional unit has a single reservation station. Reservation stations hold information needed to execute a single instruction, including the operation and the operands. The functional unit begins processing when it is free and when all source operands needed for an instruction are real.

===Exceptions===
Practically speaking, there may be exceptions for which not enough status information about an exception is available, in which case the processor may raise a special exception, called an "imprecise" exception. Imprecise exceptions cannot occur in non-[[Out-of-order execution|OoOE]] implementations, as processor state is changed only in program order (see [[Classic_RISC_pipeline#Exceptions|RISC Pipeline Exceptions]]).

Programs that experience "precise" exceptions, where the specific instruction that took the exception can be determined, can restart or re-execute at the point of the exception. However, those that experience "imprecise" exceptions generally cannot restart or re-execute, as the system cannot determine the specific instruction that took the exception.

==Instruction lifecycle==
The three stages listed below are the stages through which each instruction passes from the time it is issued to the time its execution is complete.

===Register legend===

*Op - represents the operation being performed on operands
*Qj, Qk - the reservation station that will produce the relevant source operand (0 indicates the value is in Vj, Vk)
*Vj, Vk - the value of the source operands
*A - used to hold the memory address information for a load or store
*Busy - 1 if occupied, 0 if not occupied
*Qi - (Only register unit) the reservation station whose result should be stored in this register (if blank or 0, no values are destined for this register)

===Stage 1: issue===
In the issue stage, instructions are issued for execution if all operands and reservation stations are ready or else they are stalled. Registers are renamed in this step, eliminating WAR and WAW hazards.

*Retrieve the next instruction from the head of the instruction queue. If the instruction operands are currently in the registers, then
**If a matching functional unit is available, issue the instruction.
**Else, as there is no available functional unit, stall the instruction until a station or buffer is free.
*Otherwise, we can assume the operands are not in the registers, and so use virtual values. The functional unit must calculate the real value to keep track of the functional units that produce the operand.

===Stage 2: execute===

In the execute stage, the instruction operations are carried out. Instructions are delayed in this step until all of their operands are available, eliminating RAW hazards. Program correctness is maintained through effective address calculation to prevent hazards through memory.

*If one or more of the operands is not yet available then: wait for operand to become available on the CDB.
*When all operands are available, then: if the instruction is a load or store
**Compute the effective address when the base register is available, and place it in the load/store buffer
***If the instruction is a load then: execute as soon as the memory unit is available
***Else, if the instruction is a store then: wait for the value to be stored before sending it to the memory unit
*Else, the instruction is an [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) operation then: execute the instruction at the corresponding functional unit

===Stage 3: write result===
In the write Result stage, ALU operations results are written back to registers and store operations are written back to memory.
* If the instruction was an ALU operation
** If the result is available, then: write it on the CDB and from there into the registers and any reservation stations waiting for this result
* Else, if the instruction was a store then: write the data to memory during this step

&lt;/source&gt;
|}

==Algorithm improvements==
The concepts of reservation stations, register renaming, and the common data bus in Tomasulo's algorithm presents significant advancements in the design of high-performance computers.

Reservation stations take on the responsibility of waiting for operands in the presence of data dependencies and other inconsistencies such as varying storage access time and circuit speeds, thus freeing up the functional units. This improvement overcomes long floating point delays and memory accesses. In particular the algorithm is more tolerant of cache misses. Additionally, programmers are freed from implementing optimized code. This is a result of the common data bus and reservation station working together to preserve dependencies as well as encouraging concurrency.&lt;ref name="tomasulo"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

By tracking operands for instructions in the reservation stations and register renaming in hardware the algorithm minimizes [[Read after write (Hazard)|read-after-write]] (RAW) and eliminates [[Write after write (hazard)#Write_after_write_.28WAW.29|write-after-write]] (WAW) and [[Write after read (hazard)#Write_after_read_.28WAR.29|Write-after-Read]] (WAR) [[computer architecture]] [[hazard (computer architecture)|hazard]]s. This improves performance by reducing wasted time that would otherwise be required for stalls.&lt;ref name="tomasulo"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

An equally important improvement in the algorithm is the design is not limited to a specific pipeline structure. This improvement allows the algorithm to be more widely adopted by multiple-issue processors. Additionally, the algorithm is easily extended to enable branch speculation.&lt;ref name="hennessy" /&gt; {{rp|182}}

== Applications and legacy ==
Tomasulo's algorithm, outside of IBM, was unused for several years after its implementation in the System/360 Model 91 architecture. However, it saw a vast increase in usage during the 1990s for 3 reasons:
# Once caches became commonplace, the Tomasulo algorithm's ability to maintain concurrency during unpredictable load times caused by cache misses became valuable in processors.
# Dynamic scheduling and the branch speculation that the algorithm enables helped performance as processors issued more and more instructions.
# Proliferation of mass-market software meant that programmers would not want to compile for a specific pipeline structure. The algorithm can function with any pipeline architecture and thus software requires few architecture-specific modifications.&lt;ref name="hennessy" /&gt; {{rp|183}}

Many modern processors implement dynamic scheduling schemes that are derivative of Tomasulo’s original algorithm, including popular [[Intel]] [[x86-64]] chips.&lt;ref name="intel" &gt;{{Cite report

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12780">'''Univalent foundations''' are an approach to the [[foundations of mathematics]] in which mathematical structures are built out of objects called ''types''. Types in the univalent foundations do not correspond exactly to anything in set-theoretic foundations, but they may be thought of as spaces, with equal types corresponding to homotopy equivalent spaces and with equal elements of a type corresponding to points of a space connected by a path.  Univalent foundations are inspired both by the old [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|Platonic]] ideas of [[Hermann Grassmann]] and [[Georg Cantor]] and by the "[[category theory|categorical]]" mathematics in the style of [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. It departs from the use of [[predicate logic]] as the underlying formal deduction system, replacing it, at the moment, by a version of the [[Martin-Löf type theory]]. The development of the univalent foundations is closely related with the development of [[homotopy type theory]].

Univalent foundations are compatible with [[Structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)|structuralism]], if an appropriate (i.e., categorical) notion of mathematical structure is adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/preprints/siu.pdf|title = Structuralism, Invariance, and Univalence|last = Awodey|first = Steve|date = |journal = [[Philosophia Mathematica]]|accessdate = 13 December 2014|doi = 10.1093/philmat/nkt030|authorlink = Steve Awodey|publisher = Oxford University Press|volume = 22|issue = 1|year = 2014|issn = 0031-8019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The main ideas of the univalent foundations were formulated by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] in 2006/2009. The sole reference for the philosophical connections between the univalent foundations and the earlier ideas are Voevodsky's 2014 Bernays lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Voevodsky, Foundations of mathematics - their past, present and future.
The 2014 Paul Bernays Lectures at ETH Zurich. Sep. 9-10, 2014.  See item 11 at [https://www.math.ias.edu/vladimir/lectures Voevodsky Lectures]&lt;/ref&gt; The name "univalence" is due to Voevodsky.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/univalence+axiom univalence axiom in nLab]&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed discussion of the history of some of the ideas that contribute to the current state of the univalent foundations can be found at the page on [[homotopy type theory]].

A fundamental characteristic of the univalent foundations is that they, when combined with the [[Martin-Löf type theory]], provide a practical system for formalization of modern mathematics. A considerable amount of mathematics has been formalized using this system and modern proof assistants such as [[Coq (proof assistant)|Coq]] and [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]]. The first such library called "Foundations" was created by Vladimir Voevodsky in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Foundations library, see https://github.com/vladimirias/Foundations&lt;/ref&gt; Now Foundations is a part of a larger development with several authors called [[UniMath]].&lt;ref&gt;UniMath library, see https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath&lt;/ref&gt; Foundations also inspired other libraries of formalized mathematics, such as the [[Homotopy type theory|HoTT]] Coq library&lt;ref&gt;HoTT Coq library, see https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT&lt;/ref&gt; and HoTT Agda library,&lt;ref&gt;HoTT Agda library, see https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT-Agda&lt;/ref&gt; that developed the univalent ideas in new directions.

An important milestone for the univalent foundations was the [[Séminaire Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki Seminar]] talk by Thierry Coquand&lt;ref&gt;Coquand's Bourbaki Lecture [http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/paperbourbaki.pdf Paper] and [http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/bourbaki.pdf Video]&lt;/ref&gt; in June 2014.

==Main concepts==

Univalent foundations originated from the attempts to create foundations of mathematics based on [[higher category theory]]. The closest to the univalent foundations were the ideas that [[Michael Makkai]] expressed in his visionary paper known as FOLDS.&lt;ref&gt;First Order Logic with Dependent Sorts, with Applications to Category Theory,
by M. Makkai, 1995; [http://www.math.mcgill.ca/makkai/folds/foldsinpdf/FOLDS.pdf FOLDS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The main distinction between the univalent foundations and the foundations envisioned by Makkai is the recognition that the "higher dimensional analogs of sets"  correspond to [[infinity groupoid]]s and that categories should be considered as higher-dimensional analogs of partially ordered sets.

Originally, the univalent foundations were devised by Vladimir Voevodsky with the goal of enabling those who work in classical pure mathematics to use computers to verify their theorems and constructions. The fact that the new foundations are inherently constructive was discovered in the process of writing the Foundations library (now part of the UniMath). At present, in the univalent foundations, classical mathematics is considered to be a "retract" of the constructive mathematics, i.e., classical mathematics is both a subset of the constructive mathematics that consists of theorems and constructions that use the [[excluded middle]] as their assumption and a "quotient" of the constructive mathematics by the relation of being equivalent modulo the axiom of the excluded middle.

In the formalization system for the univalent foundations that is based on the Martin-Löf type theory and its descendants such as [[Calculus of Inductive Constructions]], the higher dimensional analogs of sets are represented by types.  The world of types stratified by the concept of ''h-level'' (or ''homotopy level'').&lt;ref name=PW&gt;See p. 611 of [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2014-51-04/S0273-0979-2014-01456-9/S0273-0979-2014-01456-9.pdf Pelayo-Warren (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of h-level 0 are those equal to the one point type. They are also called contractible types.

Types of h-level 1 are those in which any two elements are equal. Such types are called in the univalent foundations "propositions".&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; The definition of propositions in terms of the h-level agrees with the definition suggested earlier by Awodey and Bauer.&lt;ref&gt;Awodey, Steven and Bauer, Andrej, Propositions as [types], J. Logic Comput. 14
(2004), no. 4, 447–471, https://doi.org/10.1093/logcom/14.4.447 or http://repository.cmu.edu/philosophy/67/.&lt;/ref&gt;  So while all propositions are types not all types are propositions.  Being a proposition is a property of a type that requires a proof. For example, the first fundamental construction of the univalent foundations is called '''iscontr'''. It is a function from types to types. If '''X''' is a type then '''iscontr X''' is a type that has an object if and only if '''X''' is contractible. It is a theorem (which is called, in the UniMath library,  '''isapropiscontr''') that for any '''X''' the type '''iscontr X''' has h-level 1 and therefore being a contractible type is a property. This distinction between properties that are witnessed by objects of types of h-level 1 and structures that are witnessed by objects of types of higher h-levels is very important in the univalent foundations.

Types of h-level 2 are called sets.&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; It is a theorem that the type of natural numbers has h-level 2 ('''isasetnat''' in UniMath). It is claimed by the creators of the univalent foundations that the univalent formalization of sets in the Martin-Löf type theory is the best available today environment for formal reasoning about all aspects of set-theoretical mathematics, both constructive and classical.&lt;ref&gt;Voevodsky(2014), Lecture 3, slide 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Categories are defined (see the RezkCompletion library in UniMath) as types of h-level 3 with an additional structure that is very similar to the structure on types of h-level 2 that defines partially ordered sets. The theory of categories in the univalent foundations is somewhat different and richer than the theory of categories in set-theoretic world with the key new distinction being between pre-categories and categories.&lt;ref&gt;See Benedikt Ahrens, Chris Kapulkin, Michael Shulman, Univalent categories and the Rezk completion, https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0584&lt;/ref&gt;

An account of the main ideas of the univalent foundations and their connection to constructive mathematics can be found in a tutorial by Thierry Coquand ([http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/ober3.pdf part 1], [http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/ober4.pdf part 2]). A presentation of the main ideas from the perspective of classical mathematics can be found in the review [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2014-51-04/S0273-0979-2014-01456-9/home.html article] by Alvaro Pelayo and Michael Warren, as well as in the introduction&lt;ref name=DG&gt;An introduction to univalent foundations for mathematicians, by Daniel R. Grayson,  Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., 2018, http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/0000-000-00/S0273-0979-2018-01616-9/home.html and https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01477 .&lt;/ref&gt; by Daniel Grayson.  See also the [https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0053 article] about the Foundations library.

==Current developments==

An account of Voevodsky's construction of a univalent model of the Martin-Löf type theory with values in Kan simplicial sets can be found in a paper by Chris Kapulkin, Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine and Vladimir Voevodsky.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Kapulkin, Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine and Vladimir Voevodsky, "The Simplicial Model of Univalent Foundations", see https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2851&lt;/ref&gt;  Univalent models with values in the categories of inverse diagrams of simplicial sets were constructed by [[Michael Shulman (mathematician)|Michael Shulman]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shulman "Univalence for inverse diagrams and homotopy canonicity", https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3253&lt;/ref&gt; These models have shown that the [[univalence axiom]] is independent from the excluded middle axiom for propositions.

Voevodsky's model is non-constructive since it uses in a substantial way the axiom of choice. 

The problem of finding a constructive way of interpreting the rules of the Martin-Löf type theory that in addition satisfies the univalence axiom and canonicity for natural numbers remains open.  A partial solution is outlined in a paper by [[Marc Bezem]], [[Thierry Coquand]] and [[Simon Huber]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Bezem, T. Coquand and S. Huber, "A model of type theory in cubical sets", see http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/mod1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with the key remaining issue being the computational property of the eliminator for the identity types.  The ideas of this paper are now being developed in several directions including the development of the cubical type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Thorsten|last1=Altenkirch|authorlink1=Thorsten Altenkirch|first2=Ambrus|last2=Kaposi|title=A syntax for cubical type theory|url=http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~txa/publ/ctt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New directions==

Most of the work on formalization of mathematics in the framework of univalent foundations is being done using various sub-systems and extensions of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions. 

There are three standard problems whose solution, despite many attempts, could not be constructed using CIC:

# To define the types of semi-simplicial types, H-types or (infty,1)-category structures on types.
# To extend CIC with a universe management system that would allow implementation of the resizing rules.  
# To develop a constructive variant of the Univalence Axiom&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.ias.edu/vladimir/Univalent_Foundations V. Voevodsky, Univalent Foundations Project (a modified version of an NSF grant application), p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

These unsolved problems indicate that while CIC is a good system for the initial phase of the development of the univalent foundations, moving towards the use of computer proof assistants in the work on its more sophisticated aspects will require the development of a new generation of formal deduction and computation systems.

'''Victor Bangert''' (born 28 November 1950, [[Osnabrück]]) is Professor of [[Mathematics]] at the Mathematisches Institut in [[Freiburg]], [[Germany]]. His main interests are [[differential geometry]] and [[dynamical systems theory]]. He is a leading expert in the theory of [[closed geodesic]]s, where one of his most celebrated result, combined with another one due to [http://www.math.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/john-franks.html John Franks], implies that every [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] 2-sphere possesses infinitely many closed geodesics. He also made important contributions to [[Aubry–Mather theory]].

He obtained his Ph.D. from [[Universität Dortmund]] in 1977 under the supervision of [[Rolf Wilhelm Walter]], with the thesis ''Konvexität in riemannschen Mannigfaltigkeiten''.&lt;ref name="MGP"&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=28718|title=Victor Bangert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served in the editorial board of [https://link.springer.com/journal/229 manuscripta mathematica] from 1996 to 2017.

Bangert was an [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|invited speaker at the 1994 International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathunion.org/db/ICM/Speakers/SortedByLastname.php |title=International Mathematical Union (IMU) |publisher=Mathunion.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
