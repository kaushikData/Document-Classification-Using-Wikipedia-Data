      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2037">"'''A New Refutation of Time'''" ({{lang-es|Nueva refutación del tiempo}}) is an essay by Argentinian writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (written between 1944 and 1946) in which he argues that the negations of [[idealism]] may be extended to time. It consists of a prologue and two articles: the first one was written in 1944 and appeared in number 115 of the review ''[[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]''; the second, written in 1946, is a rework of the first. Borges comments that he did not combine the two texts into one, as the reading of two analogous texts might facilitate the comprehension of an indocile subject.

Just as [[George Berkeley]] denies that there is an object existing independently of our perception of it, and [[David Hume]] denies that there is a subject apart from a mere recollection of sensations, Borges tries to demonstrate that there is no time.

He proceeds on the assumption that if "man" is reduced, as according to Hume, to a collection of sensations, a single repeated perception, either in one man's life or in the experience of two different men, suffices to prove that time is a fallacy, since this repetition will destroy its linear sequence.

'''Abhor''' (or '''Amba Hor''') and '''Mehraela''' were a brother and sister who were [[martyr]]s for the [[Christian faith]]. Etymology of the word "Abhor": from Latin ''abhorrēre'' (to shudder at, shrink from), from "ab" (away) and "horrēre" (to bristle, shudder).&lt;ref&gt;[https://educalingo.com/en/dic-en/abhor/ Meaning of "abhor" in the English dictionary] Retrieved on 17 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The book of their "acts" has been lost. Their [[feast day]] is celebrated on January 9 in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]].

[[File:Adlersiegel Herzog Adalbert von Teck (um 1190).jpg|thumb | Eagle seal of Adalbert, Duke of Teck ({{circa|1190}})]]

'''Adalbert I, Duke of Teck''', ({{circa|1135}} &amp;ndash; {{circa|1195}}) was a German nobleman.   After the death of his brother [[Berthold IV, Duke of Zahringen|Berthold IV]], he styled himself ''Duke of Teck'', and thus founded the elder line of the [[Dukes of Teck]], which would exist until 1439.

== Life ==
He was a son of Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Zähringen|Conrad I]] of Zähringen and his wife Clementia of Luxembourg-Namur.   He was named after his maternal uncle.

When his brother [[Berthold IV, Duke of Zahringen|Berthold IV]] died in 1186, he inherited the family possessions in the foothills of the [[Swabian Jura]], including [[Teck]] Castle and the office of [[Cup-bearer]] of the [[Abbey of St. Gall]] and the area on the upper [[Neckar]] that went with this office.

He is first mentioned as the son of Duke Conrad I in a document dated 1146; in 1152, he is named as a younger brother of Duke Berthold IV.  In May 1189, he is first mentioned as Duke of Teck ({{lang|la|Dux de Tecke}}) in a document of Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]].

A Duke "Adalbert of Teck" is also mentioned on 20 June 1192 in [[Schwäbisch Gmünd]], on 4 (or 10) December 1193 in [[Gelnhausen]] and on 12 December 1193 at the court of Henry VI in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], in a document of Count [[Egino IV, Count of Urach|Egino IV]] of Urach about [[Bebenhausen Abbey]], and by Bishop [[Diethelm of Krenkingen|Diethelm]] of [[Bishopric of Constance|Constance]] in 1192.  However, it is not clear whether these are references to Adalbert I or to his son, [[Adalbert II, Duke of Teck|Adalbert II]].

When his brother Hugh, Duke of Ullenburg died, Adalbert inherited his possessions in the [[Ortenau]] and the [[Breisgau]].  He may have already held the office of Treasurer of the [[Bishopric of Basel]].

== Marriage and issue ==
Adalbert I was married to a noblewoman named Adelaide.  Her parentage is unknown.  They had the following children:
* [[Adalbert II, Duke of Teck|Adalbert II]] (d. {{circa|1215/1219}})
* (?) Agatha, married Diepold, Count of Lechsgemünd (d. after 1192)
* (?) Matilda

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8598">An '''Administrative Monetary Penalty''' is a [[civil penalty]] imposed by a regulator for a contravention of an Act, regulation or by-law.{{sfn|LCO|2011|p=50}} It is issued upon discovery of an unlawful event, and is due and payable subject only to any rights of review that may be available under the AMP's implementing scheme.{{sfn|LCO|2011|p=50}} It is regulatory in nature, rather than criminal, and is intended to secure compliance with a regulatory scheme,{{sfn|LCO|2011|p=50}} and it can be employed with the use of other administrative sanctions, such as [[demerit point]]s and [[administrative license suspension|license suspension]]s.{{sfn|AG Ontario|2015|p=2}}

==Nature==
AMPs differ from ordinary fines, such as those for [[parking ticket]]s, in that, under the relevant legislation:{{sfn|AG BC|2008|p=5}}

#the AMP applies to a narrower segment of the general population (for example, a regulated industry);   
#imposing an AMP involves a number of steps, for instance, the person may first be given a warning and/or an opportunity to address the statutory decision-maker’s concerns (that is, to comply with the scheme); 
#the decision to impose an AMP is made by a senior official such as a Director or a person designated by that Director; 
#the criteria to guide the determination whether to impose and how to set the amount of an AMP is set out; 
#within those criteria, the person empowered to levy the penalty may be given significant discretion to decide whether to impose an AMP and to determine the appropriate amount of the AMP; and   
#the reconsideration or review/appeal of an AMP by the statutory decision-maker and/or an independent, specialized tribunalis allowed.

==AMPs by jurisdiction==
===United Kingdom===
Legislation enabling general schemes of fixed and variable monetary penalties{{em dash}}in addition to other sanctions{{em dash}}has been introduced through Part 3 of the ''[[Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008]]''.{{sfn|Prabhu|2011|pp=130{{en dash}}132}}

Under the ''Road Traffic Act 1991''{{em dash}}and subsequently expanded under part 6 of the ''[[Traffic Management Act 2004]]''{{em dash}}AMPs known as "penalty charge notices" have replaced [[fixed penalty notice]]s where local authorities have adopted schemes of [[decriminalised parking enforcement]]. In some areas such as [[London, England|London]], the challenge process for PCNs can be completed online, via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment and Traffic Adjudicators|url=http://www.londontribunals.gov.uk/eat|publisher=[[London Tribunals]]|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In ''[[Guindon v Canada]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Guindon v Canada|link=Guindon v Canada|year=2015|court=scc|num=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that AMPs are generally considered to be administrative in nature and thus not subject to the legal protections provided under [[Section 11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s.11]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. They are held not to arise from criminal proceedings, as "the purpose ... is to promote honesty and deter gross negligence"&lt;ref&gt;''Guindon'', par. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and "it is rational that the state would only wish to impose a penalty on those who engage in misconduct knowingly, recklessly, or with a particular intention."&lt;ref&gt;''Guindon'', par. 72&lt;/ref&gt; They also do not attract a true penal consequence, as "high administrative monetary penalties [are] required to encourage compliance with the administrative regime. The relevant question is not the amount of the penalty in absolute terms, it is whether the amount serves regulatory rather than penal purposes."&lt;ref&gt;''Guindon'', par. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

However, normal standards of [[judicial review]] continue to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.administrativelawmatters.com/blog/2015/08/03/its-just-a-fine-guindon-v-canada-2015-scc-41/|title= It’s Just (a) Fine: ''Guindon v. Canada'', 2015 SCC 41|last1= Daly|first1= Paul |date= August 3, 2015|website= administrativelawmatters.com|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Guindon'', the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] provided more guidance in its judgment as to when an administrative penalty would be considered disproportionate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Canada v Guindon|year=2013|court=fca|num=153|pinpoint=par. 44|date=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] has given a reasoned evaluation for a monetary penalty that arose from a securities proceeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Rowan v. Ontario Securities Commission|link=|year=2012|court=onca|num=208|pinpoint=par. 52, 55|parallelcite=110 OR (3d) 492|date=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Administrative Tribunal of Quebec]] has recognized that a person can bring forward the "reasonable, prudent and diligent person" defence that exists in civil law against the imposition of AMPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianenergylawblog.com/2015/08/04/supreme_court_of_canada_upholds_the_constitutional_validity_of_administrative_monetary_penalties/ |title=Supreme Court of Canada upholds the constitutional validity of administrative monetary penalties |last1=Gagné |first1=Michel |last2=Frémont |first2=Catherine |date=August 4, 2015 |website=canadianenergylawblog.com |publisher=[[McCarthy Tétrault]] |access-date= |quote= }}, citing ''Excavation René St-Pierre Inc. c Québec'', [http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qctaq/doc/2015/2015canlii7296/2015canlii7296.html 2015 QCTAQ 02386]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Canada]] has introduced various AMP schemes on a sector-by-sector basis,&lt;ref&gt;including the ''[[Aeronautics Act]]'', the ''Customs Act'', the ''Income Tax Act'', the ''Employment Insurance Act'' and the 
''Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act&lt;/ref&gt; although some agencies prefer to pursue ticketing schemes for specified [[summary offence]]s, notably under the ''[[Contraventions Act]]''.{{sfn|Prabhu|2011|pp=139{{en dash}}140}}

[[Ontario]] is considering creating a new AMP system to address minor offences that are currently prosecuted under its ''Provincial Offences Act''. The [[Attorney General of Ontario]] has requested input into the new system being proposed.{{sfn|AG Ontario|2015|p=1}} In response, some have suggested that, with proper planning, an online system would be more cost-efficient and promote easier access to justice for people in rural areas and for those with language barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chatten|first1=David|title=Online AMP System - A Strong Move for Ontario|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/administrative-monetary-penalties-great-move-ontario-david-chatten|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some people fear that a new system will be cumbersome and will not allow access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Driving Down Business|url=http://paralegalscope.com/driving-down-business-province-rolls-out-diy-online-poa-challenges/|website=Paralegal Scope Magazine|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agüeybaná ''' (died 1510) was one of the two principal and most powerful ''[[cacique]]s'' (chiefs) of the [[Taíno]] people in "Borikén" ([[Puerto Rico]]) when the Spanish first arrived on the island on November 19, 1493.&lt;ref name="Rebellion"&gt;[http://www.pcmle.org/EM/article.php3?id_article=258 LA REBELIÓN DEL CACIQUE AGUEYBANA II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206012148/http://www.pcmle.org/EM/article.php3?id_article=258 |date=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Agüeybana'', which has been interpreted by 19th and 20th century authors as meaning "The Great Sun", was the hereditary title shared by the family that ruled the theocratic monarchy of Borikén, governing the hierarchy over the rest of the regional chiefs or caciques. Like other nobiliary recognitions within Taíno culture, it was passed down through the maternal bloodline.&lt;ref name="pcmle.org"/&gt; The Spanish settlers Hispanicized the title to be the equivalent of the European concept of [[king]]s, with contemporary writers such as [[Juan de Castellanos]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-5lSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA125 ''Elegias de Varones illustres de Indias.''] Juan de Castellanos. Page 125. Accessed 15 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QLgOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA467 ''Historia general y natural de las Indias.''] Jose Amador de los Rios, Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdes. Page 467. Accessed 15 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; employing the title of ''Rey Agüeybana'' (English: "King Agüeybana") when referring to the second monarch to lead the Taíno during the 1510s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QLgOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA467 ''Historia general y natural de las Indias.''] Jose Amador de los Rios, Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdes. Page 467. Accessed 15 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1800s, the terms "king" and "cacique" were used exchangeably by both local and Spanish authors,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QLgOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA467 ''Historia general y natural de las Indias.''] Jose Amador de los Rios, Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdes. Page 467. Accessed 15 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y75PAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA128 ''Biblioteca historica de Puerto-Rico: Que contiene varios documentos de los Siglos XV, XVI, XVII, y XVIII.''] Alejandro Tapia y Rivera. Puerto Rico: Imprenta de Marques. 1854. Accessed 15 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; but a resurgence in the interest concerning Taíno history during the 20th century led to the popularization of native words and the latter term gained more lexical prominence.

== Arrival of the conquistadors ==
Agüeybaná received the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Juan Ponce de León]] upon his arrival in 1508. According to an old Taíno tradition, Agüeybaná practiced the "guatiao," a Taíno ritual in which he and Juan Ponce de León became friends and exchanged names. Ponce de León then baptized the cacique's mother into [[Christianity]] and renamed her Inés.&lt;ref name="Cacique"&gt;[http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~onsrud/Landtenure/CountryReport/PuertoRico.pdf Land Tenure Development in Puerto Rico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913032121/http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~onsrud/Landtenure/CountryReport/PuertoRico.pdf |date=2006-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cacique joined Ponce de León in the exploration of the island. After this had been accomplished, Agüeybaná accompanied the conquistador to the island of ''[[Hispaniola|La Española]]'' (what today comprises the nations of the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]]), where he was well received by the Governor [[Nicolás de Ovando]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/az2/puertorico/Iagueybana.html Agueybana]&lt;/ref&gt; Agüeybaná's actions helped to maintain the peace between the Taíno and the Spaniards, a peace which was to be short-lived.&lt;ref name="Cacique" /&gt;
 
The hospitality and friendly treatment that the Spaniards received from Agüeybaná made it easy for the Spaniards to betray and conquer the island.&lt;ref name="Cacique" /&gt; After a short period of peace, the Taínos were forced to work in the island's gold mines and in the construction of [[fort]]s as slaves. Many Taínos died as a result of the cruel treatment which they received.&lt;ref name="Cacique" /&gt;

== Death and aftermath==
Upon Agüeybaná's death in 1510, his brother&lt;ref name="pcmle.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spatial.maine.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; [[Güeybaná]] (better known as Agüeybaná II) became the most powerful Cacique in the island. Agüeybaná II was troubled by the treatment of his people by the Spanish and attacked them in battle. The Taínos were ultimately defeated at the Battle of Yagüecas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/saju/historyculture/upload/A%20Historical%20Overview%20of%20Colonial%20Puerto%20Rico_The%20Importance%20of%20San%20Juan%20as%20a%20Military%20Outpost.doc |title=A Historical Overview of Colonial Puerto Rico: The Importance of San Juan as a Military Outpost |accessdate=2009-03-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531083548/http://www.nps.gov/saju/historyculture/upload/A%20Historical%20Overview%20of%20Colonial%20Puerto%20Rico_The%20Importance%20of%20San%20Juan%20as%20a%20Military%20Outpost.doc |archivedate=2009-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Agüeybaná is admired in Puerto Rico for his dedication to his people and attempting to keep the peace. Puerto Rico has named many public buildings and streets after him:
* The City of [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico|Bayamón]] has named a high school after him.
* There is a street in [[Caguas, Puerto Rico|Caguas]] that honors him.
* An avenue in the Hato Rey area of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] is named after Agüeybaná.
* Puerto Rico once had an equivalent to the [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] which was awarded annually and was called the "Agüeybaná de Oro" (The Golden Agüeybaná), in honor of the great cacique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/artists/el_gran_combo/ Reference to the "Agüeybaná de Oro"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many songs and poems, by poets such as [[Juan Antonio Corretjer]], among others, have been written about Agüeybaná.

'''Benjamin Agus''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1662) was an English [[Anglicanism#Anglican divines|divine]], and was one of the most distinguished of the earlier vindicators of the [[Nonconformism|nonconformists]], and as such second only to [[Richard Baxter]], and hardly second to [[Vincent Alsop]].

His ''Vindication of Nonconformity''  and ''Antidote to Dr. [[Edward Stillingfleet|Stillingfleet]]'s Unreasonableness of Separation; being a defence of the former'',  have been allowed to slip out of sight; but they hold in them all that needs to be said in behalf of nonconformity. From the former, these words of historic importance may be quoted: ‘A little before the Black Bartholomew ([[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]] and ejection of the two thousand in 1662) a noble lord enquired whether I would conform or not? I answered: “Such things were enjoined as I could not swallow, and therefore should be necessitated to sound a retreat.” His lordship seemed much concerned for me, and used many arguments to reconcile me to a compliance, but perceiving me unmoved, at last said with a sigh: “I wish it had been otherwise; but they were resolved either to reproach you or undo you.”’ Another great lord, when speaking to him about the hard terms of conformity, said: ‘I confess I should scarcely do so much for the Bible as they require for the Common Prayer’—meaning doubtless, explains Palmer, ‘subscribing assent and consent to all and every thing in our present translation, or copy of the original. What wise man would do it?’ He has been identified with Benjamin Agas, native of [[Wymondham]], [[Norfolk]], who entered [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus College]], [[Cambridge]], in 1639, proceeded M.A in 1657, and was described in his will, dated 21 May 1683 that he was ejected from [[Chenies]], [[Buckinghamshire]].

'''Bruno Manser''' (25 August 1954 – [[Declared death in absentia|10 March 2005]]) was a Swiss [[Environmentalist|environmental activist]]. From 1984 to 1990, he stayed with the [[Penan]] tribe  in [[Sarawak]], Malaysia, organising several blockades against timber companies. After he emerged from the forests in 1990, he engaged in public activism for [[rainforest]] preservation and the [[human rights]] of [[indigenous peoples]], especially the Penan, which brought him into conflict with the Malaysian government. He also founded the Swiss [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organization (NGO)]] Bruno Manser Fonds in 1991. He disappeared during his last journey to Sarawak in May 2000 and is presumed dead.

== Early life and education ==
Bruno Manser was born in Basel on 25 August 1954 in a family of three girls and two boys.&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt;

During his younger days, Manser was an independent thinker. His parents wanted him to become a doctor, and he studied medicine informally.&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt; He completed his baccalaureate{{when|date=July 2015}}{{clarify|date=July 2015}}, the first in his family to do so.&lt;ref name=BMF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmf.ch/en/about-us/bruno-mansers-biography/|title=Bruno Manser’s biography|last=|first=|publisher=Bruno Manser Fonds|date=|website=Bruno Manser Fonds-for the people of the rainforest|accessdate=11 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509104058/http://www.bmf.ch/en/about-us/bruno-mansers-biography|archivedate=9 May 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt;

Manser spent three months in [[Lucerne]] prison when he was 19 years old because, as an ardent follower of non-violent ideologies espoused by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] ([[Satyagraha]]) he refused to participate in Switzerland's compulsory military service. After leaving prison in 1973, he worked as a sheep and cow herder&lt;ref name=bookreview&gt;{{cite news |title=Protagonist of paradise: the life, death, and legacy of Bruno Manser.(Stimmen aus dem Regenwald.

During this time, he became interested in handicrafts, therapeutics, and [[speleology]]. He laid bricks, [[Leather carving|carved leather]], kept bees, and wove, dyed, and cut his own clothes and shoes. He also regularly pursued [[mountaineering]] and technical climbing.&lt;ref name =encyclopedia&gt;Taylor, B (2008). In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=i4mvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1047&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Batu%20Lawi%20Bruno%20Manser Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature Volume I:A-J]''. [[A &amp; C Black]]. p.1046-1047. {{ISBN|1441122788}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved 12 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 30, he went to [[Borneo]], looking to live a simpler life.&lt;ref name=BMF/&gt;

==Searching for Penans==
In 1983, Manser went to the Malaysian state of [[Terengganu]] and stayed with a family. In 1984, while learning more about the rainforests, Manser learned of a [[nomad]]ic tribe known as the [[Penan|Penan tribe]]. After learning more about the tribe, he decided to attempt to live with the Penan tribe for a few years and traveled to the [[East Malaysia]]n state of [[Sarawak]] in 1984 on a tourist visa.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt;&lt;ref name=taibgumperli/&gt;

In Malaysia, he first joined an English [[caving]] expedition to explore [[Gunung Mulu National Park]]. After the expedition, he stepped deeper into the interior jungles of Sarawak, intending to find the "deep essence of humanity" and "the people who are still living close to their nature."&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt; However, he quickly became lost and ran out of food while exploring the jungle, then fell ill after eating a poisonous palm heart.&lt;ref name=notrace&gt;{{cite news |title=Without a Trace|url=http://borneo.live.radicaldesigns.org/article.php?id=265|date=3 September 2001 |last= Elegant |first= Simon |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine Asia]]|accessdate=14 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113155405/http://borneo.live.radicaldesigns.org/article.php?id=265|archivedate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After these setbacks, Manser finally found Penan nomadic tribes near the [[River source|headwaters]] of the Limbang river&lt;ref name=bookreview/&gt; at [[Long Seridan]] in May 1984.&lt;ref name=taibgumperli/&gt; Initially, the Penan people tried to ignore him. After a while, the Penans accepted him as one of their family members.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt;

In August 1984, Manser went to [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Sabah]] to obtain a visa to visit [[Indonesia]]. On the Indonesian visa, he entered [[Kalimantan]], then illegally crossed the border back into Long Seridan, Sarawak.&lt;ref name=taibgumperli/&gt;

His Malaysian visa expired on 31 December 1984.&lt;ref name=bookreview/&gt;&lt;ref name=taibgumperli&gt;{{cite news |title=Activist Bruno Manser 'flies' into arms of the law|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19990330&amp;id=Qi1PAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4988,444289|date=30 March 1999|last= Tawie|first= Sulok|publisher=[[New Straits Times]]|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life with the Penans ==
Manser learned about survival skills in the jungle and familiarized himself with the Penan's culture and language.&lt;ref name=BMF/&gt; The Penan tribal leader in Upper [[Limbang]], named Along Sega, became Manser's mentor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Father’ of Penan struggle, Along Sega, passes away|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2011/02/04/father-of-penan-struggle-along-sega-passes-away/|date=4 April 2011|last=|first=|publisher=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|accessdate=11 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812223323/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2011/02/04/father-of-penan-struggle-along-sega-passes-away/#|archive-date=12 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay with the Penan tribe, Manser adopted their way of life. He dressed in a [[loincloth]], hunted with a [[blowgun]], and ate [[primates]], snakes, and [[sago]]. Manser's decision to live as a member of the Penan tribe was ridiculed in the West, and he was dismissed as a "White Tarzan".&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt; Within the Penan tribe, however, Manser was known as "Laki Penan" (Penan Man), having earned the respect of the Penan tribe that adopted him.&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=WRM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrm.org.uy/oldsite/countries/Sarawak/Manser.html|title=Sarawak campaign - The Swiss Diplomatic Corps have started an official search for the rainforest protector|last=Suter|first=Reudi|publisher=[[World Rainforest Movement]]|date=2000|website=|accessdate=11 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812211443/http://wrm.org.uy/oldsite/countries/Sarawak/Manser.html#|archive-date=12 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manser created notebooks that were richly illustrated with drawings, notes, and 10,000 photographs during his six-year stay from 1984 to 1990 with the Penan people.&lt;ref name=BMF/&gt; Some of his sketches include cicada wing patterns, how to carry a gibbon with a stick, and how drill holes on a blowpipe.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt; These notebooks were later published by Christoph Merian Verlag press in [[Basel]].&lt;ref name=BMF/&gt; Manser also created audio recordings of oral histories told by Penan elders and translated them. He claimed that the Penan people were never argumentative or violent during his time with the Penan tribe.&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt;

In 1988, Bruno Manser tried to reach the summit of [[Bukit Batu Lawi]] but was unsuccessful, finding himself hanging on a rope without anything to grab on for 24 hours.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt; In 1989, Manser was bitten by a [[Trimeresurus|red tailed pit viper]] but he was able to treat the snake bite himself.&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt; He also got a malaria infection while living in the jungles.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt;

Unfortunately, deforestation of Sarawak's [[Old-growth forest|primeval forests]] started during Manser's stay with the Penan tribe. As a result, the Penans suffered from reduced vegetation, contaminated drinking water, fewer animals available for hunting, and the desecration of their heritage sites. Manser worked with Along Sega to teach the Penan tribe how to organize road blockades against advancing loggers. Manser organised his first blockade in September 1985.&lt;ref name=bookreview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kershaw R |year= 2011 |title= Against odds: A thirty-year struggle to save the forests of Sarawak|journal= [[Asian Affairs]] |volume= 42 |issue= 3|pages=430–446 |publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|doi= 10.1080/03068374.2011.605605|url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03068374.2011.605605#.U-leTWNCC1Q|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
Manser gave many lectures in Switzerland and abroad, making connections to people within the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[United Nations]] (UN). As an activist, he visited American and African jungles, staying in various locations for a few weeks.&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt;

He returned almost every year after leaving the Penan tribe to follow up with the logging activities and to provide assistance to the tribe, often entering these areas illegally, crossing the border with [[Brunei]] and [[Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]]. He discovered that logging conglomerates such as Samling, [[Rimbunan Hijau]], and the WTK group of companies continued their operations in Sarawak rainforests.&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt; As a result, Manser organised the Voices for the Borneo Rainforests World Tour after he left the Sarawak forests in 1990. Manser, [[Kelabit people|Kelabit]] activist Anderson Mutang Urud, and two Penan tribe members travelled from Australia to North America, Europe, and Japan.&lt;ref name=GlobalSouth&gt;Tsing, A.L(2003).

On 17 July 1991, Manser climbed unaided to the top of 30-foot high lamp post outside of the G7 media centre in [[London]]. After reaching the top, he unrolled a banner that displayed a message about the plight of Sarawak rainforests. He chained himself to the lamp post for two and a half hours. His protest also coincided with protests by [[Environmental direct action in the United Kingdom|Earth First!]] and the London Rainforest Action Group. Police used a [[hoist (device)|hoist]] to reach the top of the lamp post and cut his chains. Manser climbed down the lamp post without force at 1:40 PM. He was then taken to the Bow street police station and held until the [[17th G7 summit|G7 summit]] ended at 6:30 PM, when he was released without being charged with an offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World famous rainforest campaigner arrested after G7 lampost climb |url=http://nativenet.uthscsa.edu/archive/nl/91b/0080.html |date=18 July 1991 |last= |first= |publisher=[[University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio]] |accessdate=12 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517071719/http://nativenet.uthscsa.edu/archive/nl/91b/0080.html |archivedate=17 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Earth First!

In 1991, Manser set up Bruno Manser Fonds (BMF), a fund designed to help conserve the rainforests and the indigenous population in Sarawak. Manser ran the fund from his home at Heuberg 25, [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. In 2008, BMF was moved to Socinstrasse 37.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmf.ch/en/about-us/the-association/|title=Bruno Manser Fonds - The Association |last= |first= |publisher=Bruno Manser Fonds |date=|website=Bruno Manser Fonds-for the people of the rainforest|accessdate=11 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812223443/http://www.bmf.ch/en/about-us/the-association/|archivedate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1992 he parachuted into a crowded stadium during the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=GlobalSouth/&gt;

In December 1992, Manser led a 20-day hunger strike in front of the [[Marubeni|Marubeni Corporation]] headquarters in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt;

In 1993, Manser went on a 60-day hunger strike at the [[Federal Palace of Switzerland]] ('"Bundeshaus") to press the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Swiss parliament]] on enforcing a ban on tropical timber imports and mandatory declarations of timber products. The hunger strike was supported by 37 organisations and political parties.&lt;ref name=BMF/&gt;&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ManserPhotos&gt;{{cite news |title=Photos by late Borneo rainforest hero, indigenous rights activist go online|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0417-hance_manser.html|date=17 April 2008 |last= Hance |first= Jeremy |publisher=[[Mongabay]] |accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manser only stopped the hunger strike after his mother requested that he do so.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt; After Manser's disappearance, the Swiss parliament finally adopted the Declaration of Timber Products on 1 October 2010, with a transition period allowed until the end 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author= EU FLEGT Facility|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 2010|title= Changing International Markets for Timber and Wood Products|url= http://www.efi.int/files/attachments/publications/efi_policy_brief_5_eng_net.pdf|publisher= [[European Forest Institute]]|page= 8|docket= |accessdate= 16 September 2014 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Manser went to [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] rainforests to document the effects of wars and logging on [[Mbuti people|Ituri pygmies]].&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt;

In 1996, in the German-language programme "fünf vor zwölf" (At the eleventh hour), Manser and Jacques Christinet used auxiliary cable to drop themselves down 800 meters onto the [[Klein Matterhorn]] aerial cable car and hung sizable banners there.&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt; They reached the dangerous speed of 140 kilometers per hour while riding on a self-made rider with steel wheels and ball bearings.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt;

In 1997, Manser and his friend Jacques Christinet tried to enter [[Peninsular Malaysia]] from [[Singapore]] to fly a motorised hang-glider during the [[Commonwealth Games|1998 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. However, he was recognised at the border and denied entry into Malaysia. They then decided to swim across the [[Straits of Johor]] into Malaysia but later abandoned the plan, because it involved a lengthy 25-kilometer swim and a passage through a swamp across the straits. They planned an alternative route, opting to row a boat from an island in Indonesia into Sarawak, but Bruno Manser Foundation (BMF) in Switzerland received a warning from Malaysian embassy, warning of the consequences for such an act.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt;

In 1998, Manser and his friend Jacques Christinet travelled to [[Brunei]] and swam across the 300-metre wide Limbang river at night. Manser's friend was almost fatally injured by drifting logs along the river. They spent 3 weeks in Sarawak hiding from the police. During that time period, they attempted to order four tons of 25-centimeter nails for the Penan tribe to hammer into the tree trunks. These nails could have caused serious injuries to the loggers when the embedded nails inevitably came into contact with chainsaws.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt;

After hearing of Manser's actions, [[Al Gore]] condemned logging activities in Sarawak. [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] also described the treatment for the Penan tribe as "[[genocide]]."&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt; The [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)]] and the [[National Geographic Channel]] produced documentaries about  the Penan tribe, and Penan stories were also featured on [[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime Live]]. [[Universal Studios]] started to develop an action-adventure horror script where the Penan tribe used their forest wisdom to save the world from catastrophe. [[Warner Bros]] also developed a script on Bruno Manser story. The Penan tribe also received coverage in [[Newsweek]], [[Time (magazine)|Time]], and [[The New Yorker]].&lt;ref name=GlobalSouth/&gt;

==Response from Malaysian authorities==
Manser's actions drew anger from Malaysian authorities, and he was nearly arrested in 1986. Manser also became [[persona non grata]] (an unwelcome person) in Malaysia. A reported bounty for his capture ranged from US$30,000&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]], [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (1992).

Bruno Manser was nearly imprisoned twice in Sarawak, but managed to avoid being jailed. He was first arrested{{elucidate|date=July 2015}} on 10 April 1986{{why|date=July 2015}} after being spotted by police inspector Lores Matios. While on holiday at Long Napir, [[Limbang]], Matios arrested Manser and brought him to Limbang police station. Manser was not handcuffed, as the inspector did not carry them while on holiday. During the 90-minute ride to Limbang, the Land Rover that carried Manser came close to running out of petrol. Manser jumped out of the Land Rover and dived into a local river as the vehicle was being refilled with petrol. Matios shouted at him and used his pistol to fire two shots at Manser. Manser lost all of the notebooks he had been working on for the previous four years.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ritchie&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ritchie|first1=James|title=Bruno Manser: The Inside Story|date=1994|publisher=Summer Times|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Bruno_Manser.html?id=Ul2JNwAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Manser was nearly arrested for a second time on 25 March 1990 after meeting the same police inspector on a flight from [[Miri, Malaysia]] to [[Kuching]]. The police inspector was on his way to take a law exam in Kuching. However, the inspector did not arrest Manser.&lt;ref name=Ritchie/&gt;

===Response by Malaysian federal government===
The prime minister of Malaysia, [[Mahathir Mohamad]] blamed Manser for disrupting law and order. Mahathir also wrote a letter to Manser, telling him that it was "about time that you stop your arrogance and your intolerable European superiority. You are no better than the Penan."&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt;

In March 1992, Mahathir wrote another letter to Manser:
{{quotation|As a Swiss living in the laps of luxury with the world's highest standard of living, it is the height of arrogance for you to advocate that the Penans live on maggots and monkeys in their miserable huts, subjected to all kinds of diseases.&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt;|Mahathir Mohamad on 3 March 1992}}

===Response by Sarawak state government===
The Sarawak government defended its logging policy by stating that revenue from timber sales is needed to feed more than 250,000 of the state population. Sarawak chief minister [[Abdul Taib Mahmud]] said, "It is hoped that outsiders will not interfere in our internal affairs, especially people like Bruno Manser. The Sarawak government has nothing to hide. Ours is an open liberal society."&lt;ref name=globalisation&gt;Mitetelman, J.H. Othman, N. (2003).

== Dealing with Abdul Taib Mahmud ==
In mid-1998, Manser offered an end of hostilities with the Sarawak government if Sarawak chief minister [[Abdul Taib Mahmud]] would be willing to cooperate with him to create a biosphere around the Penan tribe's territory. Manser also wanted the government to forgive him for breaking Malaysian immigration laws. The offer was denied. His successive attempts to establish communications with the chief minister failed.&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt;

Manser planned to deliver a lamb named "Gumperli" to Taib Mahmud by air as a symbol of reconciliation with the chief minister during the [[Eid al-Fitr|Hari Raya Aidilfitri]] celebration. However, the Malaysian consulate at [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] pressured airlines not to transport the lamb to Sarawak. Manser later carried the lamb with him on a plane and parachuted over the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]], hoping to bring international attention to the Sarawak rainforests problem.&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt;

In March 1999, Manser successfully passed Kuching immigration by disguising himself in a business suit, carrying a briefcase, and wearing a badly knotted tie. On 29 March 1999, he flew a motorised paraglider, carrying a toy lamb knitted by himself&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt; while wearing a T-shirt with the image of a sheep and made a few turns above Taib's residence in [[Kuching]], [[Sarawak]]. There were 10 Penan tribe members waiting on the ground to greet Manser. At 11:30 AM, he landed the glider beside a road just outside Taib's residence and was immediately arrested. He was then transported to [[Kuala Lumpur]] on Malaysia Airlines flight MH 2683. He briefly stayed at a prison in Kuala Lumpur. He was seen playing with his knitted toy lamb by his jailers.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt; He was later deported back to Switzerland.&lt;ref name=BMF/&gt;&lt;ref name=taibgumperli/&gt;&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt;&lt;ref name=ManserPhotos/&gt;

By 2000, Manser admitted that his efforts did not bring positive changes to Sarawak.&lt;ref name =notrace/&gt; His success rate in Sarawak was "less than zero" and he was deeply saddened by the result.&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt; On 15 February 2000, just before his last trip to Sarawak, Manser said that, "[t]hrough his (Taib) logging license policies, Taib Mahmud is personally responsible for the destruction of nearly all Sarawak rainforests in one generation."&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt;

== Disappearance ==
On 15 February 2000, Manser left to visit his Penan nomadic friends via the jungle paths of [[Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]], accompanied by BMF secretary John Kuenzli and a film crew. After a period of time, the film crew and John Kuenzli left Manser in Kalimantan jungles. At the time, Manser was still writing postcards to his friends.&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt;

After the film crew and the secretary left, Manser continued his journey with another friend who knew the way around the territory. The trip continued for two weeks, crossing mountains and rivers on foot and by boat. Manser slept on a [[hammock]] while his friend slept on the ground. On 18 May, they reached the Sarawak/Kalimantan border, spending their final night there. Manser asked his friend to carry a postcard back to his girlfriend in Switzerland. According to his friend, Manser looked healthy when they parted ways. Manser complained about diarrhea and a broken rib in the postcard.&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt;

According to BMF secretary John Kuenzli, Manser crossed the Sarawak/Kalimantan border on 22 May with the help of a local guide. His last known communication was a letter mailed to his girlfriend, Charlotte, while hiding in [[Bario]]. In the letter, Manser said he was very tired while waiting for the sun to set before continuing his journey along the logging roads. The letter was deposited at the Bario post office and reached Switzerland with a Malaysian stamp but without a post office stamp.&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt; Manser was last seen carrying a 30-kilogram [[backpack]] by his Penan friend, Paleu, and Paleu's son on 25 May 2000. They accompanied Manser until they saw Bukit Batu Lawi (2000-metre limestone pinnacle in Sarawak). Manser stated his intention to climb the mountain alone and requested Paleu to leave him there. Manser has not been seen since.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt;

==Search expeditions==
BMF and the Penan tribe tried to search for Manser without any success. Areas around the Limbang river were searched by the Penan people. Penan expedition teams tracked Manser to his last sleeping place. They followed Manser's [[machete]] cuts into the thick forests until the trail reached the [[swamp]] at the foot of [[Bukit Batu Lawi]]. There was no trace of him in the swamp, going back from the swamp, or trace of anyone else coming into the area. BMF sent a helicopter to circle the limestone pinnacles. However, none of the search teams were willing to scale the last 100 metres of steep limestone that formed the peak of Batu Lawi.&lt;ref name=notrace/&gt; It is possible that Manser fell down the side of the mountain but neither his body nor his belongings have been found.&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=mystery&gt;{{cite news |title=Mystery still surrounds missing Bruno Manser - Subscription required|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-82618351.html|date=2 September 2001 |last= David |first= Adrian |publisher=[[New Straits Times]] |accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two local guides who brought Manser across the jungles of Sarawak were found. In desperation, fortune tellers and Penan [[necromancy|necromancers]] were called. All of them agreed Bruno Manser was still alive.&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt; On 18 November 2000, BMF requested that the [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]] (FDFA) search for Bruno Manser. Investigations were carried out at the Swiss Consulate in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and the Swiss Honorary Consulate in [[Kuching]].&lt;ref name=WRM/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
In January 2002, hundreds of Penan tribe members organised a ''tawai'' ceremony to celebrate Manser. The Penan people refer to Manser as ''Laki Tawang'' (man who has become lost) or ''Laki e'h metat'' (man who has disappeared), rather than his name, because speaking the names of the dead is taboo in Penan culture.&lt;ref name =encyclopedia/&gt;

On 18 Nov 2001, 18 months after his disappearance, he was awarded the International Society for Human Rights prize for Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Missing environmentalist awarded human rights prize |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/missing-environmentalist-awarded-human-rights-prize/2375656|date=July 2001|last= |first= |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After search expeditions proved fruitless, a civil court in [[Basel-Stadt]] declared Manser to be legally dead on 10 March 2005.&lt;ref name=BMF/&gt;&lt;ref name=ManserPhotos/&gt; On 8 May 2010, a memorial service was held in [[Elisabethenkirche, Basel|Elisabethen church, Basel]] to mark the 10th anniversary of his disappearance.

To celebrate Manser's 60th birthday on 25 August 2014, a species of [[Oonopidae|goblin spider]] that was discovered by a Dutch-Swiss research expedition in [[Pulong Tau National Park]], [[Sarawak]] in the 1990s is now named after Manser: ''Aposphragisma brunomanseri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scientists honor missing activist by naming a spider after him|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2014/0825-bruno-manser-spider.html|date=25 August 2014|last= |first= |publisher=[[Mongabay]]|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central City Red Zone''', also known as the '''CBD Red Zone''', was a public exclusion zone in the [[Christchurch Central City]] implemented after the 22 February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]. After February 2013, it was officially renamed the '''CBD Rebuild Zone''' by government agencies, but remained known as the Red Zone. It gradually shrank in size and the last cordons were removed on 30 June 2013, 859 days after the earthquake.

{{Main|2011 Christchurch earthquake}}
The February 2011 earthquake caused widespread damage across [[Christchurch]], especially in the central city and eastern suburbs, with damage exacerbated by buildings and infrastructure already being weakened by the 4 September [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|2010 earthquake]] and its aftershocks. The earthquake, which struck at lunchtime on a weekday, caused devastation in the central city, with two large office buildings having collapsed (the [[CTV Building]] and the PGC House), many historic building façades had collapsed into the streets, two buses were crushed by falling façades in [[Colombo Street]], and many people in [[City Mall, Christchurch|City Mall]] were trapped by fallen masonry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake/4697308/Quake-Hope-fades-after-chapel-search |title=Earthquake death toll reaches 113 |date=25 February 2011 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 185 people died in the February earthquake, 169 died in the central zone alone: 115 in the CTV building, 18 at PGC House, 8 on buses in Colombo Street and 28 others in various CBD locations.&lt;ref name="listdeceased"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.police.govt.nz/list-deceased |title= List of deceased – Christchurch earthquake |publisher=[[New Zealand Police]] |date= 8 September 2011 |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Confirmed locations of earthquake fatalities |url= http://www.police.govt.nz/sites/default/files/documents/christchurch-earthquake-fatalities-locations-map.pdf |publisher=[[New Zealand Police]] |accessdate=29 June 2013 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-Christchurch had a confusing colour-coding applied, with the same colour meaning different things in different areas.&lt;ref name= "Colour therapy"&gt;{{cite news |last=Eleven |first=Beck |title=Colour therapy |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/7777424/Colour-therapy |accessdate=29 June 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central City Red Zone is not to be confused with the [[Residential Red Zone]]. In the central city, it described the area that was cordoned off after the earthquake. In the eastern suburbs, the colour red refers to land that is subject to [[Soil liquefaction|liquefaction]] or the related effect of lateral spreading and that is deemed uneconomic to repair;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Residential red zone |url= http://cera.govt.nz/residential-red-zone |publisher=[[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 7,000&lt;!-- the reference mentions 7,860 properties, but these include 510 Port Hills properties and those will not be compulsorily purchased --&gt; properties being purchased by [[The Crown]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Residential land zoning complete |url= http://cera.govt.nz/news/2012/residential-land-zoning-complete-31-october-2012 |publisher=[[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a voluntary yet coercive scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An offer you can't refuse |url= http://pundit.co.nz/content/an-offer-you-cant-refuse |publisher=[[Pundit]] |accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Port Hills]], red zoning refers to land where it is not economic to protect buildings that are at risk from rockfall, or land that is unstable due to its proximity to cliffs, with The Crown offering to buy the land. 510 properties are zoned red in the Port Hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Port Hills red zone information|url= http://cera.govt.nz/port-hills/red-zone |publisher=[[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As explained below, the Central City Red Zone was further divided, with an outer orange zone accessible to residents. In the eastern suburbs, the orange zone was that land that had yet to be assessed and zoned (either green, blue, or red). There was no orange zone in the Port Hills, though, and land that had yet to be classified was zoned white. A white zone also applied in the central city initially, as geotechnical assessments were not carried out there for many months.&lt;ref name="Land zones"&gt;{{cite web |title=Land zones |url= http://cera.govt.nz/land-information/land-zones |publisher=[[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Avon Loop, which is located in the central city, further adds to the colour confusion. Until 13 March 2011, the Avon Loop was in the orange zone of the Central City Red Zone.&lt;ref name="cordon maps" /&gt; When the residential land zoning was first announced in June 2011, the Avon Loop was zoned orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Land Status Map |url= http://cera.govt.nz/maps/land-status |publisher=[[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Avon Loop was eventually zoned red, and this is the only land in the central city that was initially in the Central City Red Zone which later became part of the Residential Red Zone.

==Cordon==
[[File:Manchester St 22 Feb 2011 478.jpg|thumb|Manchester Street on the day of the earthquake]]
An initial cordon was established by Police and the [[New Zealand Army]] around the perimeter along the central city along Bealey Avenue, Fitzgerald Avenue, Moorhouse Avenue, Antigua Street, Rolleston Avenue, and Park Terrace.&lt;ref name="cordon maps"&gt;{{cite web |title=CBD Cordon Reduction |url= http://cera.govt.nz/maps/cordon-reduction/|publisher=[[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, cordon checkpoints were also manned by Australian Police (mostly [[New South Wales Police Force]] and [[Australian Federal Police]]) and [[Singapore Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/latest_releases?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmViaXoucG9saWNlLm5zdy5nb3YuYXUlMkZtZWRpYSUyRjE1NDU2Lmh0bWwmYWxsPTE%3D |title=NSW Police to send 200 officers to New Zealand |publisher=NSW Police Force |date=23 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628205738/http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/latest_releases?sq_content_src=+dXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmViaXoucG9saWNlLm5zdy5nb3YuYXUlMkZtZWRpYSUyRjE1NDU2Lmh0bWwmYWxsPTE%3D |archivedate=June 28, 2013 |df= }}&lt;!-- apparently archived by the Wayback Machine, but the server holding the page is down --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/02/23/3146580.htm |title=Australia sending 300 police to New Zealand |publisher=ABC News |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBD fringe is in large areas of residential nature, so the initial cordon saw many residents within the restricted area. At the last census in 2006, some 7,600 people lived within the three census zones (Avon Loop, Cathedral Square, and Hagley Park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christchurch City Territorial Authority - Area Unit Boundaries, 2006 |url= http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/CityLeisure/statsfacts/statistics/ChristchurchAreaUnitBoundaries2006-census.pdf |publisher=[[Christchurch City Council]] |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that make up the central city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Central City Population |url= http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/CityLeisure/statsfacts/statistics/Population-docs.pdf |publisher=[[Christchurch City Council]] |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A triangular area defined by Antigua Street, Hagley Avenue, and Moorhouse Avenue in the south-west of the central city was outside of the cordon.&lt;ref name="cordon maps" /&gt; Not much of that area is residential, though, as large areas are occupied by [[Christchurch Hospital]], [[Hagley Community College]], and many industrial uses. Hence, some 7,000 residents were initially affected by the red zone. The cordoned area was thus further subdivided, with an outer orange zone accessible to residents, but no access to the inner red zone other than people authorised first by [[Civil Defence (New Zealand)|Civil Defence]] and later by the [[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] (CERA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=Victoria |title=Christchurch businesses register to recover items |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/4760293/Christchurch-businesses-register-to-recover-items |accessdate=29 June 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents living in the inner red zone did not have access to their buildings and had to find accommodation elsewhere.

A vehicle recovery programme was initiated by Police around 10 March 2011. Cars and bicycles were transferred to a secured compound within Hagley Park, from where vehicle owners could retrieve their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Christchurch earthquake: Latest information - Thursday |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake/4751296/Christchurch-earthquake-Latest-information-Thursday |accessdate=29 June 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 2011, about 100 business owners protested at the [[Christchurch Art Gallery|Art Gallery]], the temporary headquarters of Civil Defence, about lack of access to critical business property (e.g. [[Server (computing)|computer server]]s, merchandise, cash) as well as a lack of communication, with some buildings having been demolished without any prior communication. They demanded to speak to the National Controller of Civil Defence, [[John Hamilton (RNZAF officer)|John Hamilton]]. When Hamilton would not see them, some of the business owners breached the inner cordon in protest by simply walking past soldiers manning the entrances, but within minutes, Police started arresting the protesters and pushed protesters back outside the inner cordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Angry cordon jumpers seek talks |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/4791575/Angry-cordon-jumpers-seek-talks |accessdate=1 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Hamish |title=Angry Chch business owners storm red zone cordon |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Angry-Chch-business-owners-storm-red-zone-cordon/tabid/423/articleID/203363/Default.aspx |accessdate=1 July 2013 |newspaper=[[3 News]] |date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the [[Government of New Zealand|Government]] issued a press release, with Civil Defence Minister [[John Carter (New Zealand politician)|John Carter]] stating that it was "foolish to breach the cordon around the red zone. People died behind that cordon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

The employment of the New Zealand Army finished on 28 June 2013, after the army having served for 858 days.&lt;ref name="job done" /&gt;&lt;!-- Note that the 858 days detail is only shown in the printed version of The Press --&gt; The cordon was removed two days later on 30 June 2013.&lt;ref name="fences come down"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Ashleigh |title=Red-zone fences come down |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/8854760/Red-zone-fences-come-down |accessdate=29 June 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=29 June 2013 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many individual buildings are still fenced off, as they are deemed unstable by the authorities; this includes the Anglican Cathedral in [[Cathedral Square, Christchurch|Cathedral Square]].&lt;ref name="fences come down" /&gt;

Over time, the role of the army personnel at the cordon entry points changed from simply restricting access to become guides to tourists and locals alike, with even locals not knowing their way around any longer as so many landmarks have been demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sachdeva |first=Sam |title=Troops become red-zone guides |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8145010/Troops-become-red-zone-guides |accessdate=29 June 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
The first time that CERA set a target date for the removal of the red zone cordons was in September 2011, when a 1 April 2012 removal was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heather|first=Ben|title=April target to remove cordon|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/5598493/April-target-to-remove-cordon|accessdate=29 June 2013|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A red zone removal by 28 June 2013 was first announced in March 2013; the ultimate removal date was 30 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stylianou |first=Georgina |title=Christchurch red zone curtain set to fall |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8478832/Christchurch-red-zone-curtain-set-to-fall |accessdate=29 June 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clavileño the Swift''' is a fictional wooden [[horse]], notable in both European and Near Eastern folklore, also appearing in chapters 40 and 41 of the second part of  the adventures of [[Don Quixote]]. It is governed by a pin in its forehead.&lt;ref&gt;Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia (fourth edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:202 225 quijote cap41.jpg|thumb|Don Quixote and Sancho imagine they are flying on Clavileño. [[Ricardo Balaca]], 19th century.]]
Don Quixote and [[Sancho Panza]] are tricked into using Clavileño, believing they have flown blindfolded and have controlled the horse with a peg in its head. The ''Dueña Dolorida''&lt;!-- In English? --&gt; (Countess Trifaldi) asserts that she and her ladies will be free of their charmed [[bearded woman|beards]] if knight and squire fly on the magical horse, sent by the sorcerer Malambruno. In reality the rocking horse is inanimate and goes nowhere, meanwhile explosives are planted near it to simulate a crash landing. [[Sancho Panza]] later goes on to say that he lifted his blindfold while "in flight" and saw the sky.&lt;ref&gt;"Don Quixote"&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spanish, "peg" is ''clavija'' and "wood", ''leño'', hence the name.

Clavileño is shown by some units of the [[Spanish Air Force]] in its badges.

The '''cortisol awakening response''' ('''CAR''') is an increase of about 50% in [[cortisol]] levels occurring 20–30&amp;nbsp;minutes ''after'' awakening in the morning in some people. This rise is superimposed upon the late-night rise in cortisol which occurs ''before'' awakening. While its purpose is uncertain, it may be linked to the [[hippocampus]]' preparation of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA) in order to face anticipated stress.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Description==
Shortly after awakening, a sharp 38–75% (average 50%) increase occurs in the blood level of [[cortisol]] in about 77%&lt;ref name="Wustwolf00"/&gt; of healthy people of all ages.&lt;ref name= "Fries"&gt;Fries E, Dettenborn L, Kirschbaum C. (2009). The cortisol awakening response (CAR): facts and future directions. Int J Psychophysiol. 72(1):67–73. {{PMID|18854200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average level of salivary cortisol upon waking is roughly 15&amp;nbsp;nmol/l; 30&amp;nbsp;minutes later it may be 23&amp;nbsp;nmol/l, though there are wide variations.&lt;ref name="Wustwolf00"&gt;Wüst S, Wolf J, Hellhammer DH, Federenko I, Schommer N, Kirschbaum C. (2000).[http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2000;volume=2;issue=7;spage=79;epage=88;aulast=Wust The cortisol awakening response – normal values and confounds.] Noise Health. 2(7):79-88. {{PMID|12689474}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cortisol awakening response reaches a maximum approximately 30&amp;nbsp;minutes after awakening though it may still be heightened by 34% an hour after waking.&lt;ref name= "Wustwolf00"/&gt; The pattern of this response to waking is relatively stable for any individual.&lt;ref name="Wustwolf00"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hucklebridge F, Hussain T, Evans P, Clow A. (2005). The diurnal patterns of the adrenal steroids cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in relation to awakening. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 30(1):51–7. {{PMID|15358442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twin studies]] show its pattern is largely [[genetically]] determined since there is a heritability of 0.40 for the mean cortisol increase after awakening and 0.48 for the area under the cortisol rise curve.&lt;ref name="Wüst"&gt;Wüst S, Federenko I, Hellhammer DH, Kirschbaum C. (2000). Genetic factors, perceived chronic stress, and the free cortisol response to awakening. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 25(7):707–20. {{PMID|10938450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, the highest cortisol secretion happens in the second half of the night with peak cortisol production occurring in the early morning. Following this, cortisol levels decline throughout the day with lowest levels during the first half of the night.&lt;ref&gt;Tsigos C, Chrousos GP. (2002). Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, neuroendocrine factors and stress. J Psychosom Res. 53(4):865–71. {{DOI|10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00429-4}} {{PMID|12377295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cortisol awakening response is independent of this circadian variation in HPA axis activity; it is superimposed upon the daily rhythm of HPA axis activity; and it seems to be linked specifically to the event of awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm I, Born J, Kudielka BM, Schlotz W, Wüst S. (2007). Is the cortisol awakening rise a response to awakening? Psychoneuroendocrinology. 32(4):358–66. {{PMID|17408865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortisol awakening response provides an easy measure of the reactivity capacity of the HPA axis.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt-Reinwald A, Pruessner JC, Hellhammer DH, Federenko I, Rohleder N, Schürmeyer TH, Kirschbaum C. (1999). The cortisol response to awakening in relation to different challenge tests and a 12-hour cortisol rhythm. Life Sci. 64(18):1653–60. {{PMID|10328525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sleep factors==
* [[Waking up]] earlier in the morning increases the response.&lt;ref&gt;Kudielka BM, Kirschbaum C. (2003). Awakening cortisol responses are influenced by health status and awakening time but not by menstrual cycle phase. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 28(1):35–47. {{PMID|12445835}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shift work]]: nurses working on morning shifts with very early awakening (between 4:00–5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.) had a greater and prolonged cortisol awakening response than those on the late day shift (between 6:00–9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.) or the night shift (between 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.–2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.).&lt;ref name="Federenko"&gt;Federenko I, Wüst S, Hellhammer DH, Dechoux R, Kumsta R, Kirschbaum C. (2004) Free cortisol awakening responses are influenced by awakening time. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 29(2):174–84. {{PMID|14604599}}&lt;/ref&gt; However another study found that this greater response could be attributed to increased [[stress (biological)|stress]] and impaired [[shift work sleep disorder|sleep quality before an early work shift]] ("when these factors were taken into account, the difference in CAR related to experimental condition was no longer significant").&lt;ref&gt;Williams E, Magid K, Steptoe A. (2005). The impact of time of waking and concurrent subjective stress on the cortisol response to awakening. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 30(2):139–48. {{PMID|15471612}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nap]]s: students taking a nap of one to two hours in the early evening hours (between 6:45–8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.) had no cortisol awakening response, suggesting cortisol awakening response only occurs after night sleep.&lt;ref name="Federenko"/&gt;
* Waking up in the light: cortisol awakening response is larger when people wake up in light rather than darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Scheer FA, Buijs RM. (1999). [http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/reprint/84/9/3395 Light affects morning salivary cortisol in humans.] J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 84(9):3395–8. {{PMID|10487717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorn L, Hucklebridge F, Esgate A, Evans P, Clow A. (2004). The effect of dawn simulation on the cortisol response to awakening in healthy participants. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 29(7):925–30. {{PMID|15177708}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Noise pollution|Noise]]: there is no cortisol rise after nights with traffic-like low-frequency noise.&lt;ref&gt;Waye KP, Clow A, Edwards S, Hucklebridge F, Rylander R. (2003). Effects of nighttime low frequency noise on the cortisol response to awakening and subjective sleep quality. Life Sci. 72(8):863–75. {{PMID|12493567}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Alarm clock]] vs. spontaneous waking: there is no difference on days when people woke up spontaneously or used the alarm clock.&lt;ref name="Wustwolf00"/&gt;
* [[Aspirin]] has been found to reduce the response probably through an action upon [[ACTH]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson S, Horton K, Bulmer S, Carlile J, Corcoran C, Gallagher P, Ferrier IN. (2009). Effect of aspirin on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function and on neuropsychological performance in healthy adults: a pilot study.Psychopharmacology 205(1):151–5. {{PMID|19404617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual factors==

==Stress==
Cortisol awakening response is larger for those:

Suspected non-adherence and weekend versus week day differences in the awakening cortisol response.

(2006). Clinical burnout is not reflected in the cortisol awakening response, the day-curve or the response to a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 31(2):216–25. {{PMID|16150550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurology==
Cortisol is released from the [[adrenal gland]]s following activation by [[ACTH]] release from the [[pituitary]]. The ACTH release creating the cortisol awakening response is strongly inhibited after intake of a low-dose [[dexamethasone]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrhart-Bornstein M, Bornstein SR, Scherbaum WA. (1996). Sympathoadrenal system and immune system in the regulation of adrenocortical function. Eur J Endocrinol. 135(1):19–26. {{PMID|8765968}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a synthetic [[glucocorticoid]] and this inhibition allows the detection of the presence of [[negative feedback]] from circulating cortisol that controls to [[ACTH]]-secreting cells of the pituitary.

In the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] the pituitary release of ACTH is regulated by the [[hypothalamus]]. This occurs through the hypothalamus's production of the hypophysiotropic hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone, the production of which is subject to circadian influence and the day/night cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanisms of Body Function|last=Widmarier|first=Eric P.|last2=Raff|first2=Hershel|last3=Strang|first3=Kevin T.|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2016|isbn=|edition=14th|location=New York, NY|pages=335|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cortisol awakening response, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is controlled by the [[hippocampus]]. For example, cortisol awakening response is absent in those with bilateral and unilateral hippocampus damage&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan TW, Kern S, Allen JS, Tranel D, Kirschbaum C. (2004). Circadian regulation of cortisol after hippocampal damage in humans. Biol Psychiatry.;56(9):651–6. {{PMID|15522248}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hippocampal [[cerebral atrophy|atrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruehl H, Wolf OT, Convit A. (2009). A blunted cortisol awakening response and hippocampal atrophy in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 34(6):815–21. {{PMID|19167831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with severe [[amnesia]], and thus with presumed damage to the [[temporal lobe]], also do not have it.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf OT, Fujiwara E, Luwinski G, Kirschbaum C, [[Hans Markowitsch|Markowitsch HJ]]. (2005). No morning cortisol response in patients with severe global amnesia. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 30(1):101–5. {{PMID|15358447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with a larger hippocampus have a greater response.&lt;ref name="pruessner07"&gt;Pruessner M, Pruessner JC, Hellhammer DH, Bruce Pike G, Lupien SJ. (2007). The associations among hippocampal volume, cortisol reactivity, and memory performance in healthy young men. Psychiatry Res. 155(1):1–10. {{PMID|17395434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's plausible also that the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]], the light-sensitive biological clock, plays a role in cortisol awakening response regulation.&lt;ref name="Fries"/&gt;

==Function==
The function of cortisol awakening response is unknown but it has been suggested to link with a stress-related preparation in regard to the upcoming day by the hippocampus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Law|first1=Robin|last2=Evans|first2=Phil|last3=Thorn|first3=Lisa|last4=Clow|first4=Angela|last5=Hucklebridge|first5=Frank|title=The cortisol awakening response predicts same morning executive function: results from a 50-day case study|journal=Stress: The International Journal on the Biology of Stress|date=2015|volume=18|issue=6|pages=616–621|doi=10.3109/10253890.2015.1076789|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English|issn=1025-3890}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis is: "that the cortisol rise after awakening may accompany an activation of prospective memory representations at awakening enabling individual's orientation about the self in time and space as well as anticipation of demands of the upcoming day... it is tempting to speculate that for the CAR, anticipation of these upcoming demands may be essential in regulating the CAR magnitude for the particular day. The hippocampus is, besides its established role in long-term memory consolidation, involved in the formation of a cohesive construct and representation of the outside world within the central nervous system processing information about space, time and relationships of environmental cues. This puts the hippocampus in a pivotal position for the regulation of the CAR."&lt;ref name="Fries"/&gt;

'''Dark tourism''' (also '''black tourism ''' or '''grief tourism''') has been defined as [[tourism]] involving travel to places historically associated with [[death]] and [[tragedy (event)|tragedy]].&lt;ref name="Lennon"/&gt; More recently, it was suggested that the concept should also include reasons tourists visit that site, since the site's attributes alone may not make a visitor a "dark tourist".&lt;ref name=Rami/&gt; '''Thanatourism''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ir5BZWeOoiAC&amp;pg=PA266 |   title=Heritage, Museums and Galleries: An Introductory Reader|author=Gerard Corsane|year= 2005|page= 266|isbn= 978-0415289467|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the ancient Greek word ''[[thanatos]]'' for the personification of death, refers more specifically to peaceful death; it is used in fewer contexts than the terms ''dark tourism'' and ''grief tourism''. The main attraction to dark locations is their historical value rather than their associations with death and suffering.&lt;ref name=Rami /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gonomad.com/features/0704/dark-tourism.html|work=gonomad.com|title=Shedding Light on Dark Tourism|author= Courtney C. Reed|accessdate=1 March 2014|date=April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field of study==
While there is a long tradition of people visiting recent and ancient settings of death, such as travel to [[gladiator]] games in the Roman [[colosseum]], attending public executions by [[decapitation]], and visiting the [[catacombs]], this practice has been studied academically only relatively recently.
Travel writers were the first to describe their tourism to deadly places. [[P. J. O'Rourke]] called his travel to [[Warsaw]], [[Managua]], and [[Belfast]] in 1988 'holidays in hell',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Rourke|first=P. J.|title=Holidays in Hell|year=1989|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=978-0330306836}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Chris Rojek talking about 'black-spot' tourism in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rojek|first=Chris|title=Ways of Escape: Modern Transformations in Leisure and Travel|year=1993|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-0333475782|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ways_of_escape.html?id=Ex1HAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 March 2014|quote=(P 142)The leisure forms constructed around black spots certainly give signs of repetition-compulsion and seeking the duplication of experience. (p170) The gravity and solemnity of Black Spots have been reduced by moves to make them more colorful and more spectacular than other sights on the tourist trail. For example, in 1987 the government of Thailand unveiled plans to restore the famous Death Railway …}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the 'milking the macabre'.&lt;ref name=Dann&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Tourism: The Next Decade|year=1994|publisher=Butterworth Heinemann|location=Oxford|pages=55–67|last=Dann|first= G|chapter=Tourism the nostalgia industry of the future|editor=W. Theobald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic attention to the subject originated in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]: The term 'dark tourism' was coined in 1996 by Lennon and Foley, two faculty members of the Department of Hospitality, Tourism &amp; Leisure Management at [[Glasgow Caledonian University]],&lt;ref name="Lennon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foley|first=Malcolm|author2=J. John Lennon|title=JFK and dark tourism: A fascination with assassination|journal=International Journal of Heritage Studies|year=1996|volume=2|issue=4|pages=198–211| doi=10.1080/13527259608722175|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13527259608722175#preview|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term 'thanatourism' was first mentioned by A. V. Seaton in 1996, then Professor of Tourism Marketing at the [[University of Strathclyde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seaton|first=AV|title=Guided by the dark: from thanatopsis to thanatourism|journal=Int Journal of Heritage Studies|year=1996|volume=2|issue=4|pages=234–244|doi=10.1080/13527259608722178|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeXWAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=thanatourism#v=onepage&amp;q=thanatourism&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 March 2014|isbn=9781136394966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, there have been many studies on definitions, labels, and subcategorizations, such as  [[Holocaust tourism]] and slavery-heritage tourism, and the term continues to be molded outside academia by authors of travel literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writings On The Dark Side Of Travel|date=March 15, 2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0857453419| editor=Jonathan Skinner}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is very little [[empirical research]] on the perspective of the dark tourist.&lt;ref name=Rami&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rami Khalil Isaac |author2=Erdinç Çakmak |title=Understanding visitor's motivation at sites of death and disaster: the case of former transit camp Westerbork, the Netherlands|journal=Current Issues in Tourism|volume=17 |issue=2 |year=2013|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/13683500.2013.776021}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Dark tourism has been formally studied from three main perspectives by a variety of different disciplines:

===Hospitality and tourism===
Scholars in this interdisciplinary field have examined many different aspects. Lennon and Foley expanded their original idea &lt;ref name="Lennon"/&gt; in their first book, deploring that "tact and taste do not prevail over economic considerations” and that the "blame for transgressions cannot lie solely on the shoulders of the proprietors, but also upon those of the tourists, for without their demand there would be no need to supply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dark tourism: The attraction of death and disasters|year=2000|publisher=Thomson Learning|location=London|author=Lennon, J.|author2=Foley, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
Philip Stone and Richard Sharpley from the Department of Tourism and Leisure Management of the [[Lancashire Business School]] at the [[University of Central Lancashire]], UK have looked through the lens of the market place at dark tourism; they have coined the term 'product of dark tourism', and discuss its supply, demand, and consumption by the 'dark tourist'. Stone and Sharpley have published prolifically in this area, although not conducted empirical research, and founded an Institute for Dark Tourism. 
In 2005 Stone suggested that "within contemporary society people regularly consume death and suffering in touristic form, seemingly in the guise of education and/or entertainment", and sounded a call for research on "Dark Tourism Consumption" to "establish [[consumer behavior]] models that incorporate contemporary socio-cultural aspects of death and dying."&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=P|title=Dark Tourism Consumption – A call for research|journal=E-Review of Tourism Research|year=2005|volume=2|issue=5|pages=109–117|quote=contemporary society with its ...late capitalism broad defining features include an increased commercial ethic and commodification; a de-differentiation of time and space through global technological communication; and an introduction of anxiety and doubt over the project of modernity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 paper Stone discussed "the dark tourism product range", arguing that "certain suppliers [of dark tourism] may [...] share particular product features, perceptions and characteristics, which can then be loosely translated into various 'shades of darkness'." His typology of death-related tourist sites consists of seven different types, ordered from light to dark: dark fun factories, dark exhibitions, dark dungeons, dark resting places, dark shrines, dark conflict sites and dark camps of [[Genocide|genocide.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=P|title=A dark tourism spectrum: Towards a typology of death and macabre related tourist sites, attractions and exhibitions|journal=Tourism|year=2006|volume=54|issue=2|pages=145–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Stone and Sharpley hypothesized, that coming together in places associated with grief and death in dark tourism represents immorality, so that morality may be communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Consuming dark-tourism a thanatological perspective|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|year=2008|volume=35|issue=2|pages=574–595|author1=Stone, P.  |author2=Sharpley, R|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2008.02.003|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/3995/1/1-s2.0-S0160738308000261-main.pdf__tid%3D90f05cc0912e830dc006127480a0a0f0%26acdnat%3D1344587777_cab3d67ccfefbcd5c8d9192d03f7182f}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===The exploitation of the deceased===
Whether a tourist attraction is educational or exploitative is defined by both its operators and its visitors.&lt;ref name="jeju"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=776|title=Exploitation or healthy interest? An analysis of dark tourism.|author= Darryl Coote|date= 2010-06-12|publisher=Jeju Weekly|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism operators motivated by greed can "milk the macabre"&lt;ref name=Dann /&gt; or reexamine tragedies for a learning experience. Tourists consuming dark tourism products may desecrate a place and case studies are needed to probe who gains and loses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNSFAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq|title=Contemporary issues in tourist development|editor1=Richard W. Butler |editor2=Douglas G. |page =122|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134623600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanatourism and slum-tourism have been described as re-interpreting the pastime according to the needs of financial elite.&lt;ref&gt;Tzanelli R (2016) Thana Tourism and the Cinematic Representation of Risk. Abingdon, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Misinformation===
[[Chris Hedges]] described the "[[Alcatraz]] narrative as presented by the [[National Park Service]]" as "[[whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]]", because it "...ignores the savagery and injustice of America's system of mass incarceration". By omitting challenging details, the park service furthers a "[[Disneyfication]]", per Hedges.&lt;ref name=hedges&gt;{{cite news|author1=Chris Hedges|title=Alcatraz: A Prison as Disneyland|url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/alcatraz_a_prison_as_disneyworld_20141130|work=Truthdig.com|publisher=Zuade Kaufman|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example destinations==
Destinations of dark tourism include: castles and battlefields such as [[Battle of Culloden#Culloden battlefield today|Culloden]] in Scotland and [[Bran Castle]] and [[Poienari Castle]] in Romania; former [[prison]]s such as [[Beaumaris Prison]] in [[Anglesey]], Wales and the [[Jack the Ripper]] exhibition in the [[London Dungeon]]; sites of [[natural disaster]]s or [[Anthropogenic hazard|man made disaster]]s, such as [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]] in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum website|url=http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/index_e2.html|work=[[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=1 March 2014|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chernobyl]] in Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chernobylpripyat.com/ |publisher=chernobylpripyat.com |title=Chernobylzone |accessdate=February 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225173644/http://www.chernobylpripyat.com/ |archivedate=February 25, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrainianweb.com/chernobyl_ukraine.htm|title=Chernobyl Tours|publisher= Ukrainianweb.com|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chernobyl-tour.com/english|publisher=Chernobyl-TOUR|title=Chernobyl tour, official provider of Chernobyl exclusion zone|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the commercial activity at [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] in New York one year after [[September 11, 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/28/1023864657451.html|work=2002 The Age Company Ltd|author=Jayson Blair|date=June 29, 2002|title=Tragedy turns to tourism at Ground Zero|accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes sites of human atrocities and [[genocide]], such as the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.auschwitz.org/m/|title=Memorial Museum Auschwitz Birkenau|publisher=[[Państwowe Muzeum Auschwitz-Birkenau]] w Oświęcimiu|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall]] in China, the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]] in Cambodia; the sites of the [[Jeju Uprising]] in South Korea&lt;ref name="jeju" /&gt; and the Spirit Lake Internment Camp Centre near [[Trécesson, Quebec|La Ferme, Quebec]] as an example of [[Ukrainian Canadian internment|Canada's internment operations]] of 1914–1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch of Quebec Internment Spirit Lake Interpretive Centre|url=http://www.internmentcanada.ca/PDF/articles/Spirit_Lake.pdf.|work=press release|publisher=[[Canadian First World War Internment Recognition Fund]]|accessdate=February 28, 2014|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bali "death and funeral rites have become [[commodification|commodified]] for tourism ..., where enterprising businesses begin arranging tourist vans and sell tickets as soon as they hear someone is dying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLaren|first=Deborah|title=Rethinking Tourism and Ecotravel|date=June 2003|publisher=Kumarian Press|isbn=978-1565491694|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rpTBdeBSFywC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2|accessdate=1 March 2014|quote=One of the most disturbing phenomena in Bali is the commercialization of cremation ceremonies.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, visitors can tour the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in Washington D.C. "with an identity card which matches their age and gender with that of a name and photo of a real holocaust victim. Against a backdrop of video interpretation portraying killing squads in action, the pseudo holocaust victim enters a personal ID into monitors as they wander around the attraction to discover how their real-life counterpart is faring."&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

== Launch of ''Current Issues in Dark Tourism Research'' ==
In late 2017, the online journal ''Current Issues in Dark Tourism Research'' was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shop by|journal=Current Issues in Dark Tourism Research|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the online journal is to bring affordable 'dark tourism' scholarship direct to students, researchers, and the media. The journal is unique in that it pays royalty fees to authors and, as a result, is a new model for contemporary academic publishing. Authors and scholars may submit their own related research for publication in the journal. A broad range of 'dark tourism and difficult heritage' research will be available in the journal, in the form of articles, case studies, and commentaries. The editor of the journal is Dr Philip Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Selected Works of Dr Philip Stone|url=https://works.bepress.com/philip_stone/|website=Bepress|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kevin Gately''' (18 September 1953 &amp;ndash; 15 June 1974) was a second year student of mathematics at the [[University of Warwick]] who died as a result of head injuries received in the [[Red Lion Square disorders]] in London. He was the first person to die in a public demonstration in Great Britain for at least 55 years,&lt;ref name="bbcretro"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/15/newsid_2512000/2512725.stm|title=On this day 1974: Man dies in race rally clashes|publisher=BBC Online|accessdate=2009-04-08 | date=15 June 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the [[British Army]] shot two looters dead in Liverpool during the riots associated with a [[British police strikes in 1918 and 1919|police strike]] in August 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eMnZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=56 The media and political violence], Richard L.

==Background==
Gately was born in England to parents of Irish descent. He had red hair and was approximately 6' 9" tall; contemporary photos show him standing out above the crowd because of his exceptional height.  &lt;!--where was he born?  Where did he attend school?--&gt;  He became a mathematics student at [[Warwick University]], and was in his second year in June 1974, three months before his 21st birthday.

He was not a member of any political group or party, and had no experience of demonstrations before Red Lion Square,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jun/17/archive-dead-student-fell-under-the-crowd-1974 From the archive, 17 June 1974: Dead student fell under crowd], The Guardian, 17 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Socialist Worker'', 22 June 1974, asserts that Gately had not previously been on a political demonstration.&lt;/ref&gt; although he was aware of the nature of the demonstration against the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] and wished to take part.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AGAsAQAAMAAJ ''Only One Died''] by Tony Gilbert (published by K. Beauchamp 1975), {{ISBN|0-9504283-0-2}}, page 222: 'Sedley [Counsel for the N.U.S. at the Scarman Tribunal] then pointed out, that practically every student who gave evidence was not a member of the I.M.G. nor was Kevin Gately.'&lt;/ref&gt;  His girlfriend also attended the demonstration.

==Red Lion Square disorders==
{{main|Red Lion Square disorders}}
The Red Lion Square disorders arose from a counter-demonstration against a National Front march through the West End of London to a meeting at [[Conway Hall]], in the north east corner of [[Red Lion Square]] in [[Bloomsbury]] near [[Holborn tube station|Holborn Underground station]], on Saturday 15 June 1974.&lt;ref name=brain/&gt;

The National Front had been formed in 1967, and by 1974 its racist policies were gathering some electoral support, with the National Front winning 10 per cent of the vote in some areas of London, particularly where unemployment was high.  The National Front march and meeting on 15 June 1974 was itself a protest against the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's proposal to grant an amnesty to illegal immigrants.  The National Front planned a march from [[Westminster Hall]], handing in a petition as they passed [[Downing Street]], to their meeting in Conway Hall.&lt;ref name=brain/&gt;  The National Front had been using Conway Hall for meetings during the previous four years, but anti-fascist pickets began in October 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sMkqoKkxW9sC&amp;pg=PA43 Urban culture: critical concepts in literary and cultural studies, Volume 3], Chris Jenks, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004, {{ISBN|0415304989}}, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/04/race.otherparties  Blood and glory], The Observer, 4 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=igIKdpj82t8C&amp;pg=PT172 White Riot: Punk Rock and the Politics of Race], edited by Stephen Duncombe, Maxwell Tremblay, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;  On 15 June 1974, they planned a meeting entitled "Stop immigration - start repatriation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1974/jun/17/disturbances-red-lion-square#S5CV0875P0_19740617_HOC_192 Disturbances (Red Lion Square)], Hansard, HC Deb 17 June 1974 vol 875 cc29-3729&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary organisers of the counter-demonstration were the London Area Council of Liberation (formerly the Movement for Colonial Freedom), with participation from the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB), the [[International Marxist Group]] (IMG) and the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]] (later the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]]) and other left-wing groups.  Liberation booked a smaller room at Conway Hall for a separate meeting, to be preceded by a march along a route agreed in advance with the police, starting at the [[Thames Embankment]] to avoid the route of the National Front march, but the police agreed that both marches could end at the same destination: Red Lion Square.  An open-air meeting was planned on the north side of the square, to the west of the National Front meeting in Conway Hall, with an address by [[Syd Bidwell]], the Labour MP for [[Southall (UK Parliament constituency)|Southall]].  The edition of the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]'' on 15 June 1974 encouraged support for the counter-demonstration, including messages from trades union leaders.  After the event, the Honorary President of Liberation, Lord Brockway, stated that he had opposed the potential for a confrontation and violence from groups that joined the counter-demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1974/jun/17/red-lion-square-demonstration#S5LV0352P0_19740617_HOL_119 Red Lion Square Demonstration], Hansard, HL Deb 17 June 1974 vol 352 cc746-51&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberation march of around 1,200 people came from the east, moving westwards along [[Theobald's Road]] and turned left (south) at Old North Street to enter Red Lion Square about half way along its northern edge, before turning right (west) to where a platform was set up for the meeting.  A police cordon blocked the way to the left, east of Old North Street, to allow the National Front march to reach Conway Hall.

Disorder broke out when the counter-march arrived at Red Lion Square at around 3:30 pm.  Some demonstrators from the IMG group at the rear of the march attempted to block the route by which the National Front march would reach Conway Hall, and challenged the police cordon intended to keep the two groups of marchers apart.  Gately was marching with IMG contingent, which included other students that came from Warwick by bus.  The police cordon was reinforced by members of the [[Special Patrol Group]] and by [[mounted police]], who eventually forced the demonstrators back and then cleared the square, with liberal use of police truncheons.

The National Front march of around 900 people approached from the west, marching down [[Bloomsbury Way]] to the west side of [[Southampton Row]], accompanied by an [[Orange Order]] fife and drum band.  The march arrived at Southampton Row around 20 minutes later, at around 5:50 pm, where they were stopped by the police.  There were other altercations nearby close to Southampton Row.&lt;ref name="bbcretro"/&gt;

Some newspapers reported "police brutality".&lt;ref name=payne&gt;Quoted in [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6bW4WSRgfKoC&amp;pg=PA123 Forensic medicine: clinical and pathological aspects], edited by Jason Payne-James, Anthony Busuttil, William S. Smock, Cambridge University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|1841100269}}, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 40 policemen were treated for injuries, and many demonstrators too, with around 50 arrested.&lt;ref name="bbcretro"/&gt;

==Gately's death==
The body of Kevin Gately was found on the ground among the fighting, and taken to a [[St John Ambulance]] crew. His friends from Warwick only realised that he was missing when they met after the demonstration ended. A student who enquired at [[University College Hospital]] was shown Kevin's body and asked to identify him.

Fellow students who were with Gately said that he was injured after several charges and counter-charges involving mounted police, foot police and demonstrators.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Many others were injured, including 39 policemen.  Clive Bloom, author of ''Violent London: 2,000 Years of Riots, Rebels and Revolts'', asserts Kevin Gately "died under a police horse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5067489/Riot-Wed-rather-have-a-cup-of-tea.html|title=Riot? We'd rather have a cup of tea|last=Bloom|first=Clive|date=2009|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=2009-04-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An inquest at [[St Pancras Coroner's Court]] later concluded that his death was caused by a [[brain haemorrhage]] resulting from  a blow to the head from a blunt instrument.&lt;ref name="bbcretro"/&gt; His exceptional height led several newspapers of the time to allege that his death may have been the result of a blow from a mounted police truncheon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Neither a coroner's inquest nor a public inquiry headed by [[Leslie Scarman, Baron Scarman|Lord Justice Scarman]] were able to find evidence to prove or disprove this claim.&lt;ref name=brain/&gt;

==Inquest and public inquiry==
A post-mortem examination gave inconclusive results, it was reported on 17 June,&lt;ref&gt;"Inconclusive tests on rally clash victim", The Times, Monday, Jun 17, 1974; pg. 1; Issue 59117; col D&lt;/ref&gt; but it quickly became clear that he had died from a blow to the head.&lt;ref&gt;"Student in demonstration died after blow to head, pathologist's report says", The Times, Tuesday, Jun 18, 1974; p. 1; Issue 59118; col C&lt;/ref&gt;  The coroner's inquest heard that the cause of his death was a [[subdural haemorrhage]] caused by a modest blow to his head, and the jury returned a verdict of [[death by misadventure]] on 12 July 1974 by a majority of 10-1.&lt;ref&gt;"Misadventure verdict on Red Lion Square demonstrator", The Times, Saturday, Jul 13, 1974; p. 3; Issue 59138; col A&lt;/ref&gt;  He was found to have a small oval bruise behind his left ear, and had collapsed shortly afterwards, only 10&amp;nbsp;ft (3 m) from the edge of the police cordon.  Possible causes for the injury were a blow from an implement, such as police truncheon, or from a projectile, or from being kicked after falling to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;"Student in Red Lion Square clash 'slipped unconscious to ground 10ft from police cordon', inquest told", The Times, Friday, Jul 12, 1974; p. 2; Issue 59137; col A&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquest was followed by a [[public inquiry]] led by Lord Justice Scarman, under rarely used power under section 32 of the [[Police Act 1964]] to order a local inquiry into policing in a particular area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1974/jun/28/disturbances-red-lion-square Disturbances (Red Lion Square)], Hansard, HC Deb 28 June 1974 vol 875 c566W&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar powers were used for another inquiry by Scarman (by then a member of the House of Lords) after the [[1981 Brixton riot]].  By contrast, there was no inquiry after the deaths of [[Liddle Towers]] in 1976, or of [[Blair Peach]] or Jimmy Kelly in 1979.

The Scarman inquiry spent twenty-three days receiving evidence from police and marchers, and another four days reviewing written representations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19750228&amp;id=l45AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=26QMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5291,5957915 Student Marxist groups blamed for Red Lion Square Riot], Glasgow Herald, 28 February 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details?uri=C9097 Scarman Inquiry into Red Lion Square Disorders: Minutes, Evidence and Papers], National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;   The IMG leaders on 15 June – Brian Heron and David Bailey – initially denied charging the first police cordon, but later admitted doing so to the Scarman inquiry.

Scarman's report was published on 27 February 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1975/feb/27/demonstration-red-lion-square#S5CV0887P0_19750227_CWA_76 Demonstration (Red Lion Square)], Hansard, HC Deb 27 February 1975 vol 887 cc211-2W211W&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6bW4WSRgfKoC&amp;pg=PA123 The Red Lion Square disorders of 15 June 1974: report of inquiry by the Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Scarman], Cmnd 5919, HMSO, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  Scarman accepted that Gately was not a rioter, but had been carried along by the surging crowd, and stated: "It was possible, though very unlikely, that in the melee he was struck by a police truncheon."&lt;ref name=payne/&gt;  Scarman concluded that Gately was a victim, not of the police, or of a criminal demonstrator, but of the situation in which he found himself.  He apportioned some of the blame to riotous protesters, and attributed the injury to a "minor unnoticed accident - a fall or an apparently minor glancing blow".&lt;ref name=brain/&gt;&lt;ref name=payne/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Gately was buried in [[Surbiton]] on Friday 21 June, after a funeral at St Raphael's church in Surbiton, where he had been baptised.&lt;ref&gt;"500 students march as Kevin Gately is buried", The Times, Saturday, Jun 22, 1974; p. 2; Issue 59121; col B&lt;/ref&gt;  Also on 21 June, 500 students marched through Coventry with black armbands.  The following day, Saturday 22 June 1974, thousands joined a silent march retraced the route of the Liberation counter-demonstration from the embankment to Red Lion Square. The march was led by personal friends of Gately, followed by University of Warwick students and then by students from many other universities and colleges as well as contingents from many of the left wing groups that had taken part in the original march. This march also received widespread media coverage.

Gately's death led to a major campaign by Warwick students against the National Front.&lt;ref name="bbcretro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dscalm.warwick.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?&amp;dsqIni=Dserve3.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqKey=RefNo&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNO='KGA')AND(Level='Collection') Warwick University Kevin Gately Action Committee  1974]&lt;/ref&gt;  A Kevin Gately Memorial Painting by Maureen Scott hangs in the Warwick University Students' Union, and was restored in 2004. It is displayed alongside contemporary [[telegram]]s of support from many other students' unions and a copy of ''[[Socialist Worker]]'' from the week following Gately's death. The painting is symbolic of the anti-fascist struggle and contains neither a representation of Gately nor of the events of June 1974.  In 2009, it was suggested that a new student bar at Warwick University could be named after Gately, but the name "The Dirty Duck" was chosen instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theboar.org/2009/01/13/new-pub-will-not-be-named-after-student/ New pub will not be named after student], The Boar, 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Demonstrations against the National Front continued through the 1970s and into the 1980s.  [[Death of Blair Peach|Blair Peach]] was killed at an [[Anti-Nazi League]] demonstration which turned violent in Southall in April 1979.  Syd Bidwell said in Parliament that Peach, together with Gately, would be "regarded by history as a martyr and a young courageous campaigner against Fascism and racism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1979/may/25/southall-demonstrations#S5CV0967P0_19790525_HOC_41 Southall (Demonstrations)], Hansard, HC Deb 25 May 1979 vol 967 cc1390-405&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe]] referred to Gately's death, and the aim of preventing similar deaths, in the House of Lords consideration in 2009 of the justification for the Metropolitan Police's policy of "[[kettling]]" protesters at Oxford Circus on 1 May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2009/5.html Austin v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis], [2009] UKHL 5, para 47&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward St. John Gorey''' (February 22, 1925&amp;nbsp;– April 15, 2000) was an [[Americans|American]] writer and artist noted for his illustrated books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Kelley| first = Tina| title = Edward Gorey, Eerie Illustrator And Writer, 75| newspaper = The New York Times| date = April 16, 2000| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/16/nyregion/edward-gorey-eerie-illustrator-and-writer-75.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; His characteristic pen-and-ink drawings often depict vaguely unsettling narrative scenes in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] settings.

==Early life==
Edward St. John Gorey was born in [[Chicago]]. His parents, Helen Dunham (née Garvey) and Edward Lee Gorey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/gorey.html|title=Ancestry of Edward Gorey|last=Reitwiesner|first=William Addams|date=|website=www.wargs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; divorced in 1936 when he was 11, then remarried in 1952 when he was 27. One of his stepmothers was [[Corinna Mura]] (1909–1965), a cabaret singer who had a small role in the classic film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' as the woman playing the guitar while singing "[[La Marseillaise]]" at Rick's Café Américain. His father was briefly a journalist. Gorey's maternal great-grandmother, Helen St. John Garvey, was a popular nineteenth-century [[greeting card]] writer and artist, from whom he claimed to have inherited his talents.

Gorey attended a variety of local grade schools and then the [[Francis W. Parker School (Chicago)|Francis W. Parker School]]. He spent 1944 to 1946 in the [[United States Army|Army]] at [[Dugway Proving Ground]] in [[Utah]]. He then attended [[Harvard University]], beginning in 1946 and graduating in the class of 1950; he studied French and roomed with poet [[Frank O'Hara]].&lt;ref name="HARVARDMAGAZINE2007"&gt;Lumenello, Susan, [http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/03/edward-gorey.html "Edward Gorey: Brief life of an artful author: 1925–2000"], ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'', March–April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, Gorey, with a group of recent Harvard alumni including [[Alison Lurie]] (1947), [[John Ashbery]] (1949), [[Donald Hall]] (1951) and Frank O'Hara (1950), amongst others, founded the Poets' Theatre in Cambridge, which was supported by Harvard faculty members [[John Ciardi]] and [[Thornton Wilder]].&lt;ref name="HARVARDMAGAZINE2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRANDSTREET1984"&gt;[[Nora Sayre|Sayre, Nora]], [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25006626 "The Poets' Theatre: A Memoir of the Fifties"], ''[[Grand Street (magazine)|Grand Street]]'', Vol. 3, No. 3 (Spring, 1984), pp. 92–105. Published by: Ben Sonnenberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HARVARDMAGAZINE2002"&gt;[http://harvardmagazine.com/2002/01/obsessed-at-harvard.html "Open Book: Obsessed at Harvard"], ''Harvard Magazine'', January–February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

He frequently stated that his formal art training was "negligible"; Gorey studied art for one semester at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1943.

==Career==
From 1953 to 1960, he lived in [[Manhattan]] and worked for the Art Department of [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] Anchor, illustrating book covers and in some cases, adding illustrations to the text. He illustrated works as diverse as [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats]]''. In later years he produced cover illustrations and interior artwork for many children's books by [[John Bellairs]], as well as books begun by Bellairs and continued by [[Brad Strickland]] after Bellairs' death.

His first independent work, ''The Unstrung Harp'', was published in 1953. He also published under various pen names, some of which were [[anagram]]s of his first and last names, such as Ogdred Weary, Dogear Wryde, Ms. Regera Dowdy, and dozens more. His books also feature the names Eduard Blutig ("Edward Gory"), a German-language [[pun]] on his own name, and O. Müde (German for O. Weary).

''[[The New York Times]]'' credits bookstore owner Andreas Brown and his store, the [[Gotham Book Mart]], with launching Gorey's career: "it became the central clearing house for Mr. Gorey, presenting exhibitions of his work in the store's gallery and eventually turning him into an international celebrity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Gussow| first = Mel| title = Edward Gorey, Artist and Author Who Turned the Macabre into a Career, Dies at 75| newspaper = The New York Times| date = April 17, 2000| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/17/arts/edward-gorey-artist-and-author-who-turned-the-macabre-into-a-career-dies-at-75.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorey's illustrated (and sometimes wordless) books, with their vaguely ominous air and ostensibly [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] settings, have long had a [[cult following]]. He made a notable impact on the world of theater with his designs for the [[Dracula (1924 play)#1977 revival|1977 Broadway revival of ''Dracula'']], for which he won the [[Tony Award for Best Costume Design]] and was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design]]. In 1980, Gorey became particularly well known for his animated introduction to the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[Mystery!]]'' In the introduction of each ''Mystery!'' episode, host [[Vincent Price]] would welcome viewers to "Gorey Mansion".

[[File:Edward Gorey House 3.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Edward Gorey House]], [[Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts]] (2006)]]
Because of the settings and style of Gorey's work, many people have assumed he was British; in fact, he only left the U.S. once, for a visit to the Scottish Hebrides. In later years, he lived year-round in [[Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts]], on [[Cape Cod]], where he wrote and directed numerous evening-length entertainments, often featuring his own [[papier-mâché]] puppets, an ensemble known as Le Theatricule Stoique. The first of these productions, ''Lost Shoelaces'', premiered in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]] on August 13, 1987. The last was ''The White Canoe: an Opera Seria for Hand Puppets'', for which Gorey wrote the libretto, with a score by the composer [[Daniel James Wolf]]. Based on Thomas Moore's poem ''The Lake of the Dismal Swamp'', the opera was staged after Gorey's death and directed by his friend, neighbor, and longtime collaborator Carol Verburg, with a puppet stage made by his friends and neighbors, the noted set designers Herbert Senn and Helen Pond. In the early 1970s, Gorey wrote an unproduced screenplay for a [[silent film]], ''The Black Doll''.

After Gorey's death, one of his executors, Andreas Brown, turned up a large cache of unpublished work complete and incomplete. Brown described the find as "ample material for many future books and for plays based on his work".&lt;ref name="locus"&gt;"The Data File: Gorey Discoveries", ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'', December 2000, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Although Gorey's books were popular with children, he did not associate with children much and had no particular fondness for them. Gorey never married, professed to have little interest in romance, and never discussed any specific romantic relationships in interviews. In the book ''The Strange Case of Edward Gorey'', published after Gorey's death, his friend [[Alexander Theroux]] reported that when Gorey was pressed on the matter of his [[sexual orientation]], he said that even he was not sure whether he was [[homosexuality|gay]] or [[heterosexuality|straight]]. When asked what his sexual orientation was in an interview, he said,
{{quote|I'm neither one thing nor the other particularly. I am fortunate in that I am apparently reasonably undersexed or something&amp;nbsp;... I've never said that I was gay and I've never said that I wasn't&amp;nbsp;... what I'm trying to say is that I am a person before I am anything else&amp;nbsp;...}}

Edward Gorey agreed in an interview that the "sexlessness" of his works was a product of his [[asexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Edward|last=Gorey|year=2002|title=Ascending Peculiarity: Edward Gorey on Edward Gorey|publisher=Harvest Books|isbn=978-0-15-601291-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 to his death in April 2000, the normally reclusive artist was the subject of a ''[[cinéma vérité]]''-style documentary directed by [[Christopher Seufert]]. (As of 2016, the film has been screened as a work-in-progress; the finished film and accompanying book are in [[post-production]].) He was interviewed on ''Tribute to Edward Gorey,'' an hour-long community, [[public-access television]] cable show produced by artist and friend Joyce Kenney. He contributed his videos and personal thoughts. Gorey served as a judge at Yarmouth art shows and enjoyed activities at the local cable station, studying computer art and serving as cameraman on many Yarmouth shows. His Cape Cod house is called ''Elephant House'' and is the subject of a photography book entitled ''Elephant House: Or, the Home of Edward Gorey,'' with photographs and text by Kevin McDermott. The house is now the [[Edward Gorey House|Edward Gorey House Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, Kevin. ''Elephant House: Or, the Home of Edward Gorey''. Pomegranate Communications (2003). {{ISBN|0-7649-2495-8}} and {{ISBN|978-0-7649-2495-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorey left the bulk of his estate to a charitable trust benefiting cats and dogs, as well as other species, including bats and insects.&lt;ref name="locus" /&gt;

==Style==
Gorey is typically described as an illustrator. His books may be found in the humor and cartoon sections of major bookstores, but books such as ''The Object Lesson'' have earned serious critical respect as works of [[surrealism|surrealist]] art. His experimentation—creating books that were wordless, books that were literally matchbox-sized, pop-up books, books entirely populated by inanimate objects—complicates matters still further. As Gorey told Lisa Solod of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', "Ideally, if anything were any good, it would be indescribable."&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook |last = Dery |first = Mark |title = Born to Be Posthumous: The Eccentric Life and Mysterious Genius of Edward Gorey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzlTDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT20&amp;lpg=PT20&amp;dq=Ideally,+if+anything+were+any+good,+it+would+be+indescribable.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=izSDKHINdD&amp;sig=EesJznR4CMvU_rMDHMhKga-biVc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUgfS00uveAhXspVkKHQWyBywQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ideally%2C%20if%20anything%20were%20any%20good%2C%20it%20would%20be%20indescribable.&amp;f=false |publisher = Little, Brown and Company |date = November 6, 2018 |isbn = 978-0316188548 |page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorey classified his own work as [[literary nonsense]], the genre made most famous by [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Edward Lear]].

In response to being called [[Gothic fiction|gothic]], he stated, "If you're doing nonsense it has to be rather awful, because there'd be no point. I'm trying to think if there's sunny nonsense. Sunny, funny nonsense for children—oh, how boring, boring, boring. As [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] said, there is no happy music. And that's true, there really isn't. And there's probably no happy nonsense, either."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Schiff|Schiff, Stephen]]. "Edward Gorey and the Tao of Nonsense." ''The New Yorker'', November 9, 1992: 84–94, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Gorey's works were published obscurely and are difficult to find (and priced accordingly),{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} however, the following four omnibus editions collect much of his material.

== Pseudonyms ==

Gorey was very fond of word games, particularly [[anagram]]s. He wrote many of his books under pseudonyms that usually were anagrams of his own name (most famously Ogdred Weary). Some of these are listed below, with the corresponding book title(s). Eduard Blutig is also a word game: "Blutig" is German (the language from which these two books purportedly were translated) for "bloody" or "gory".

==Legacy==
Gorey has become an iconic figure in the [[goth subculture]]. Events themed on his works and decorated in his characteristic style are common in the more [[Victorian era|Victorian]]-styled elements of the subculture, notably the Edwardian costume balls held annually in San Francisco and Los Angeles, which include performances based on his works. The "Edwardian" in this case refers less to the [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] period of history than to Gorey, whose characters are depicted as wearing fashion styles ranging from those of the mid-nineteenth century to the 1930s. 

Director [[Mark Romanek]]'s music video for the [[Nine Inch Nails]] song "[[The Perfect Drug]]" was designed specifically to resemble a Gorey book, with familiar Gorey elements including oversized urns, [[topiary]] plants and glum, pale characters in full Edwardian costume.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Mark Romanek, in the currently unreleased documentary by Christopher Seufert.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Caitlín R. Kiernan]] has published a short story entitled "A Story for Edward Gorey" (''[[Tales of Pain and Wonder]]'', 2000), which features Gorey's black doll.

A more direct link to Gorey's influence on the music world is evident in ''The Gorey End'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tigerlillies.com/2003/index.php?main=recordings&amp;pubId=5 The Tiger Lillies' webpage for this album]; EMI 7243 5 57513 2 4&lt;/ref&gt; an album recorded in 2003 by [[The Tiger Lillies]] and the [[Kronos Quartet]]. This album was a collaboration with Gorey, who liked previous work by The Tiger Lillies so much that he sent them a large box of his unpublished works, which were then adapted and turned into songs. Gorey died before hearing the finished album.

In 1976, [[jazz]] composer [[Michael Mantler]] recorded an album called ''The Hapless Child'' (Watt/ECM) with [[Robert Wyatt]], [[Terje Rypdal]], [[Carla Bley]], and [[Jack DeJohnette]]. It contains musical adaptations of ''The Sinking Spell'', ''The Object Lesson'', ''The Insect God'', ''The Doubtful Guest'', ''The Remembered Visit'', and ''The Hapless Child''. The last three songs also have been published on his 1987 ''Live'' album with [[Jack Bruce]], [[Rick Fenn]], and [[Nick Mason]].

The opening titles of the [[PBS]] series ''[[Mystery!]]'' are based on Gorey's art, in an animated sequence co-directed by [[Derek Lamb]].

In the last few decades of his life, Gorey merchandise became quite popular, with stuffed dolls, cups, stickers, posters, and other items available at malls around the United States.

In 2007, [[The Jim Henson Company]] announced plans to produce a feature film based on ''The Doubtful Guest'' to be directed by [[Brad Peyton]]. No release date was given and there has been no further information since the announcement.

The online journal ''Goreyesque'' publishes artwork, stories, and poems in the spirit of Edward Gorey's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kogan|first1=Rick|title=Step inside Edward Gorey's weird, beautiful world|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/museums/ct-edward-gorey-loyola-university-exhibit-20140404-column.html|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is co-sponsored by the Department of Creative Writing at [[Columbia College Chicago]] and [[Loyola University Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chavez|first1=Danette|title=Goreyesque Wants Your Edward Gorey-Inspired Writing and Artwork|url=http://gapersblock.com/bookclub/2014/03/31/goreyesque_wants_your_edward_gorey-inspired_art/|website=gapersblock.com|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Goreyesque'' was launched in tandem with the Chicago debut of two Gorey collections: ''Elegant Enigmas: The Art of Edward Gorey'' and ''G is for Gorey''.

'''Elizabeth Frances Amherst''' ({{circa|1716}} &amp;ndash; 1779), [[poet]] and amateur [[naturalist]], remained largely unpublished during her lifetime.

She was born to Elizabeth Kerrill and Jeffrey Amherst (1677–1750) of [[Kent]], one of two girls and seven boys. She married John Thomas, rector of [[Nutgrove, Cheshire]] and of [[Welford-on-Avon|Welford]], [[Gloucestershire]]; the couple had no biological children and adopted a son, the child of a brother-in-law. One of her brothers, [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery]],&lt;!--yes spelled Jeffery--&gt; became [[Baron Amherst of Holmesdale in the County of Kent|Baron Amherst]] in 1776 and later was made a [[field-marshal]]: he was Commander-in-Chief of the [[British forces]] when they took [[Montreal]] in 1760.

Elizabeth Amherst was an avid [[fossil collector]] and maintained an active correspondence on the subject both before and after her marriage. Her poetry, described as "sprightly" (Greer et al. 179), would seem to have circulated mainly in [[manuscript]], though a few poems were printed anonymously in the 1760s. They are mainly known, however, from the [[Bodleian]] manuscript, "The Whims of E.A. afterwards Mrs. Thomas."

'''Epigeal''', '''epigean''', '''epigeic''' and '''epigeous''' are [[biological]] terms describing an [[organism]]'s activity above the [[soil]] surface.

In [[botany]], a [[seed]] is described as showing '''[[epigeal germination]]''' when the [[cotyledon]]s of the [[germinate|germinating]] seed expand, throw off the seed shell and become [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] above the ground. The opposite kind, where the cotyledons remain non-photosynthetic, inside the seed shell, and below ground, is [[hypogeal germination]].

The terms '''epigean''', '''epigeic''' or '''epigeous''' are used for organisms that crawl (epigean), creep like a [[vine]] (epigeal), or grow (epigeous) on the soil surface: they are also used more generally for [[animal]]s that neither burrow nor swim nor fly. The opposite terms are [[hypogean]], [[hypogeic]] and [[hypogeous]].

An epigeal nest is a term used for a termite mound, the above ground nest of a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] of [[termite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Soil Ecology |last=Lavelle |first=P. |last2=Spain |first2=A. |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9780792371236 |page=503 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCC1sOmFTSMC&amp;pg=PA503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forerunner''' is a [[fictional]] [[Fictional character|character]] published by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #46 (August 2007), and was created by [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], Justin Gray and Jesus Saiz.

==Fictional character biography==
Viza Aziv's [[origin story]], as well as the history of her race, is depicted in ''Countdown to Adventure'' #1.  The Forerunners' planet is the Earth of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#52|an alternate universe]], ravaged by years of destructive war.  The other "Nine Houses" ([[planet]]s and [[dwarf planet]]s) of the [[Solar System]] declared the planet a War World in which they would battle for occupancy.  Survivors of the wars - the strongest and fittest - remained on the planet and interbred, unknowingly guided to do so by [[the Monitors (comics)|the Monitors]].  The process produced the Forerunners, a species possessing traits of the beings from other planets such as [[Martian Manhunter|Green Martians]] and [[Jemm|Saturnians]].  When the Nine Houses decided that the Forerunners were a threat that had to be eliminated, the Monitors intervened and formed a pact with the Nine Houses: the Monitors would keep the Forerunners from moving against the Nine Houses.  For their own purposes, the Monitors would appoint one Forerunner as their Instrument of Righteous Death whom they also called [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]].

Viza is a member of a genetically engineered race of warriors tasked with serving the Monitors, and was assigned by a Monitor to kill anomalous beings inhabiting the Multiverse.  In her first appearance, she battled [[Jason Todd]] and [[Donna Troy]] during their investigation of the death of [[Duela Dent]].&lt;ref&gt;''Countdown'' #46 (June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to eliminate the two, she was denounced by one of the Monitors and suffered a crisis of confidence.  Vowing to stay on Earth until she regained the trust of the Monitors, Forerunner was later contacted by [[Captain Atom]] (now called [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]]) who recruited her to aid him in his plans. He accused the Monitors of deploying a Harbinger, [[Dark Angel (DC Comics)|Dark Angel]], to wipe out the Forerunner race. Monarch granted Forerunner an entire [[Bleed (comics)|Bleed]]-based armada with which to wage war against the Monitors.&lt;ref name="Newsarama"&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=117857 Counting down with Mike Marts: Countdown #45 - Newsarama&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214100237/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=117857 |date=December 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Countdown to Final Crisis''===
{{main|Countdown to Final Crisis}}
Monarch discloses that Viza Aziv was chosen as the Monitors' warrior because they feared something in her: she was an unexpected outcome of the breeding program which created the Forerunners.  Viza is sent by Monarch to recruit the JLA's of Earth-10 and the Conjurers of Earth-33. The Conjurers were forewarned of Viza's arrival by Dark Angel, who disguised herself as an [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]].  Forerunner is captured, Dark Angel reveals herself; Forerunner ultimately strikes her down. Dark Angel escapes; when Monarch arrives Viza rebukes his attempts to gather new recruits.  When they return to the Bleed, Monarch attacks Forerunner for questioning his authority. She attacks him, but realizes that damaging Monarch's suit would unleash a catastrophic explosion, and she relents.

Monarch informs Forerunner that the [[Countdown: Arena|Arena]] tournament is about to begin, and that he doesn't need her services any longer. He teleports her to an unknown region of space.  Forerunner is rescued by a passing freight ship, which is attacked by pirates.  Forerunner boards the pirate ship, kills the captain, and evicts all non-necessary crew members.  The ship is attacked by a [[Thanagar]]ian fleet. The flagship, seeking the ship's original captain, demands her surrender.  In response, Forerunner  challenges their leader, [[Golden Eagle (comics)|Golden Eagle]], to single combat.  Viza invokes the law of choice, a custom on her home world, empowering the victor to take any prize they desire.  After defeating Eagle and his troops, Viza takes ''him'' as her prize; he's an initially unwilling sex slave.  The ship reaches the [[Source Wall]], which has a gaping hole at its center.

The crew encounter an Earth space shuttle with a young boy in cryogenic stasis, whom they bring aboard.  Forerunner commands the crew to pass through the wall, where they see Monarch's forces battling the Monitors.  Forerunner locates the Monitors' base, which leads to events seen in ''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #15: she attacks the Monitor named Solomon; [[Superboy-Prime|Superman-Prime]] arrives and brutally bests her.  In #13, she attacks Solomon again while Prime fights Monarch, again to no avail.  Before Solomon can finish her, [[Darkseid]] appears, and convinces Solomon to join him on [[Apokolips]].

After returning to the ship, Forerunner is told that passing through the Source Wall depleted the ships energy reserves, and that they only have forty-eight hours of power and oxygen left.  The ship ends up trapped in no-space, and the crew are contacted by a sentient planet, who offers them the fuel they need in return for escorting a young planet across the sector.  During the trip, they are attacked, and, at the young planet's request, Forerunner places a drop of her blood onto its land, allowing it to create antibodies from her DNA.  When their task is completed, it is revealed that the young planet will soon make a new Forerunner race from Viza's blood.  Viza decides to stay with the planet, and become the new race's Thought Mother.

==Powers and abilities==
Viza Aziv possesses considerable superhuman strength and resistance to injury.  She was able to resist gunfire from an automatic rifle and is tough enough that Donna Troy was injured simply by punching her. Forerunner can move at speeds well in excess to that of a normal human being. Her rate of acceleration and maximum velocity has yet to be determined but she was fast enough that a normal human could not follow her movement. However, it seems, while generally faster than a normal human, these feats of considerable superhuman speed are only temporary boosts. Because of the general life-style of her species she has excessive weapon and hand-to-hand combat training. She has defeated numerous [[Superman|Supermen]] in the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] although she proved no match for Superman-Prime. She possesses [[telepathy]] and the ability to become temporarily [[invisible]], presumably from her Martian ancestry. She has also been seen throwing various types of spikes at enemies.  Viza also wears gloves with sharply tipped fingers that she can use as a weapon to slash at enemies.

At this point, it is unclear if Viza Aziv's abilities are typical of her race, although evidence seems to suggest so{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. All members of her race have a genetic fail safe which prevents them from attacking Monitors.

The '''Global War on Error''' is a campaign to eliminate [[aviation]] errors. The term was coined by Tony Kern, CEO of [[Covergent Knowledge Solutions]].

[[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] manufacturer of [[aircraft]], has adopted the campaign. The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] also incorporated techniques developed by the program.

The campaign is intended to be synergistic with new technology and with the [[FAA]] Safety Management System approach. The campaign was initially funded with a $300,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Defense.

'''Hasdrubal Barca''' (245{{nbsp}}– 22{{nbsp}}June 207{{nbsp}}BC), a [[latinization of names|latinization]] of '''ʿAzrubaʿal''' ({{lang-xpu|𐤏𐤆𐤓‬‬𐤁‬𐤏𐤋‬}}){{sfnp|Huss|1985|p=[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NvEK7kc3qnQC&amp;pg=PA566 566]}} son of [[Hamilcar Barca]], was a [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] general in the [[Second Punic War]]. He was the brother of [[Hannibal]] and [[Mago Barca]].

==Youth and Iberian leadership==
[[File:Dishekel hispano-cartaginés-2.jpg|thumb|A [[Carthaginian currency|Carthaginian]] [[shekel]], dated 237-227 BC, depicting the Punic god [[Melqart]] ([[interpretatio graeca|equivalent]] to [[Hercules]]), most likely with the features of [[Hamilcar Barca]], father of Hannibal Barca; on the reverse is a man riding a [[war elephant]]]]
Little is known of Hasdrubal's early life. He was present, along with his brother [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]], when his father, [[Hamilcar Barca|Hamilcar]], besieged the city of [[Helike]]. Hamilcar was forced to flee and drowned in the Jucar River.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253349/Hamilcar-Barca&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about his activities during the time [[Hasdrubal the Fair]] led the Punic forces in Spain, or during the campaigns of Hannibal Barca in Spain and his [[Siege of Saguntum]].

Hannibal, when he set out for Italy in 218 BC, left a force of 13,000 infantry&lt;!--rounded; 12,750 per Livy &amp; Polybius--&gt;, 2,550 cavalry and 21 [[war elephant]]s in Iberia. The Punic navy had a fleet of 50 [[quinqueremes]] and 5 [[triremes]] stationed there. However, only 32 Quinqueremes were manned at the start of the [[Second Punic War]]. Hasdrubal commanded this force and was to set out for Italy in 217 BC to reinforce Hannibal. Hannibal left another army under Hanno in Catalonia, consisting of 10,000 foot and 1,000 horse on his way to Italy in 218 BC.

Left in command of [[Hispania]] when Hannibal departed to Italy in 218 BC, Hasdrubal was destined to fight for six years against the brothers [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus|Gnaeus]] and [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]]. The expedition led by Gnaeus Scipio in 218 BC had caught the Carthaginians by surprise, and before Hasdrubal could join Hanno, the Carthaginian commander on the North of Ebro River, the Romans had fought and won the [[Battle of Cissa]] and established their army at [[Tarraco]] and their fleet at [[Emporiae]]. Hasdrubal, commanding only 8,000 troops and outnumbered by the Romans, raided the Romans with a flying column of light infantry and cavalry, which inflicted severe losses on their naval crews and reduced the fighting strength to 35 ships. This loss was offset by the arrival of an allied Greek contingent from the city of [[Marseilles|Massilia]].

In the spring of 217 BC, Hasdrubal led a joint expedition north to fight the Romans. He commanded the army, while his deputy commanded the fleet. The Punic Army and the fleet moved north side by side and encamped on the mouth of the Ebro River. Carelessness of the Carthaginian fleet enabled Gnaeus Scipio to surprise the Carthaginians and crush their naval contingent at the [[Battle of Ebro River]]. Hasdrubal retreated without fighting the Roman army. The year 216 was spent quelling an uprising of Iberian tribes, possibly the Turdetanii around the area near [[Cádiz|Gades]].

Hasdrubal was reinforced by 4,000 infantry and 500 cavalry and was ordered by the Carthaginian senate to march to Italy in the same year. He left [[Himilco|Himilco the Navigator]] in charge at [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] and marched for the Ebro river, but was heavily defeated in the [[Battle of Dertosa]] in the spring of 215 BC. This defeat prevented reinforcements reaching Hannibal from both Iberia and Africa at a critical moment of the War, when the Carthaginians held the upper hand in Italy. The Carthaginians from then on were forced to contest the Romans in the area between the Ebro and Jucor rivers.

==Joint command==
This defeat also led to [[Mago (Barcid)|Mago]] and [[Hasdrubal Gisco]] arriving in Iberia with two armies and ending the undisputed command of the [[Barcid]] family in Iberia. The Carthaginains fought the Scipio brothers and had on the whole the worst of the conflict between 215 and 212 BC, but managed to prevent the loss of any territory. At the instigation of the Romans, [[Syphax]], one of the kings of the Numidian tribes, attacked Carthaginian territories in Africa in 213/212 BC. The situation in Iberia was sufficiently under control, because Hasdrubal and his Iberian army crossed over to Africa and crushed the threat of Syphax in a battle where 30,000 Numidians were killed. With his Roman-trained army shattered, Syphax fled to Mauritania. The aid of [[Masinissa]], a Numidian prince, was invaluable during this episode, and he crossed over to Iberia with Hasdrubal after the African expedition ended with 3,000 Numidian cavalry.

In late 212 BC, Hasdrubal, with timely cooperation from Mago Barca and Hasdrubal Gisco, completely routed his opponents at the [[Battle of the Upper Baetis]], destroying the majority of the Roman army in Iberia and killing both the Scipios. Carthaginians gained control of Iberia up to the Ebro as a result of this victory. However, the lack of cooperation between the Carthaginian generals led to the surviving Roman force of 8,000 retiring safely to the north of the river Ebro. These troops somehow managed to keep the Carthaginian armies from gaining a foothold north of the Ebro. The Romans reinforced this detachment with 10,000 troops under Claudius Nero in 211 BC and with another 10,000 soldiers under [[Scipio Africanus Major]] in 210 BC, who spent the year training his army and improving his diplomatic contacts.

The Carthaginian armies had dispersed into the interior of Iberia in 209 BC, possibly to maintain control over the Iberian tribes, which they were dependent on for soldiers and provisions. The Carthaginian armies were subsequently outgeneraled by [[Scipio Africanus Major]], who, taking advantage of the absence of the three Carthaginian armies in 209 BC, captured Carthago Nova and gained other advantages. Hasdrubal was defeated by Scipio at the [[Battle of Baecula]] but managed to retreat with two-thirds of his army intact.

==Second Carthaginian expedition to Italy==
Later in 209 BC, Hasdrubal was summoned to join his brother in Italy. He eluded Scipio by crossing the [[Pyrenees]] at their western extremity and safely made his way into [[Gaul]] in the winter of 208. Hasdrubal had waited until the spring of 207 to make his way through the [[Alps]] and into Northern Italy. Hasdrubal made much faster progress than his brother had, partly due to the construction left behind by Hannibal's army when he had passed via the same route a decade earlier, but also due to the removal of the Gallic threat that had plagued Hannibal early on. The Gauls now feared and respected the Carthaginians, and not only was Hasdrubal allowed to pass through the Alps unmolested, his ranks were bolstered by many enthusiastic Gauls. Hasdrubal, in the same fashion as his brother, succeeded in bringing his [[war elephant]]s, raised and trained in Hispania. It was not until Hasdrubal sent messengers to Hannibal that decisive measures were taken. Hasdrubal wished to meet with his brother in South Umbria. However, this was not to be. Hasdrubal's messengers were captured, and he was ultimately checked by two Roman armies. Being forced to give battle, he was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of the Metaurus]]. Hasdrubal, with his armies defeated and in full disorganized retreat, charged into the fray to his certain death, and was beheaded. His head was packed into a sack and thrown into his brother Hannibal's camp as a sign of his utter defeat. This action was in stark contrast to Hannibal's treatment of the bodies of fallen Roman Consuls.

Harris was one of the 1,500 who died in the ''Titanic'''s sinking on April 15, 1912.&lt;ref name=Brooklyn/&gt; A survivor's eyewitness account suggests that Harris went to his death needlessly. Mrs. Emil Taussig and her husband, along with the Harrises, went to the deck as they felt the collision. After the women had been placed in a lifeboat, there was still room for other passengers. When Harris and Taussig attempted to enter the lifeboat, both men were threatened with [[revolver]]s. Mrs. Taussig said this boat was lowered with empty seats aboard it; she and her daughter were passengers on this lifeboat.&lt;ref name=revolvers&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9200159/threat_revolvers/|title=Threatened with Revolvers|publisher=Courier-Journal|page=1|date=April 20, 1912|accessdate=February 27, 2017|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=revolvers2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9200180/revolvers_2/|title=Threatened with revolvers 2|publisher=Courier-Journal|page=2|date=April 20, 1912|accessdate=February 27, 2017|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said when she last saw Henry Harris and her husband, both were standing side by side as they waved goodbye to their loved ones aboard the lifeboats.&lt;ref name=revolvers2/&gt;

In [[machine learning]], a '''Hyper basis function network''', or '''HyperBF network''', is a generalization of [[Radial basis function network|radial basis function (RBF) networks]] concept, where the [[Mahalanobis distance|Mahalanobis]]-like distance is used instead of Euclidean distance measure. Hyper basis function networks were first introduced by Poggio and Girosi in the 1990 paper “Networks for Approximation and Learning”.&lt;ref name="PoggioGirosi1990"&gt;T. Poggio and F. Girosi (1990). "Networks for Approximation and Learning". ''Proc. IEEE'' '''Vol. 78, No. 9''':1481-1497.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahdi"&gt;R.N. Mahdi, E.C. Rouchka (2011). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5733426 "Reduced HyperBF Networks: Regularization by Explicit Complexity Reduction and Scaled Rprop-Based Training"]. ''IEEE Transactions of Neural Networks'' '''2''':673–686.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network Architecture==

The typical HyperBF network structure consists of a real input vector &lt;math&gt;x\in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, a hidden layer of activation functions and a linear output layer. The output of the network is a scalar function of the input vector, &lt;math&gt;\phi: \mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by 
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\phi(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}a_j\rho_j(||x-\mu_j||)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a number of neurons in the hidden layer, &lt;math&gt;\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; are the center and weight of neuron &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. The [[activation function]] &lt;math&gt;\rho_j(||x-\mu_j||)&lt;/math&gt; at the HyperBF network takes the following form
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rho_j(||x-\mu_j||)=e^{(x-\mu_j)^T R_j(x-\mu_j)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R_j&lt;/math&gt; is a positive definite &lt;math&gt;d\times d&lt;/math&gt; matrix. Depending on the application, the following types of matrices &lt;math&gt;R_j&lt;/math&gt; are usually considered&lt;ref name="Schwenker"&gt;F. Schwenker, H.A. Kestler and G. Palm (2001). "Three Learning Phases for Radial-Basis-Function Network" ''Neural Netw.'' '''14''':439-458.&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;R_j=\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\mathbb{I}_{d\times d}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. This case corresponds to the regular RBF network.
* &lt;math&gt;R_j=\frac{1}{2\sigma_j^2}\mathbb{I}_{d\times d}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_j&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the basis functions are radially symmetric, but are scaled with different width.
* &lt;math&gt;R_j=diag\left(\frac{1}{2\sigma_{j1}^2},...,\frac{1}{2\sigma_{jz}^2}\right)\mathbb{I}_{d\times d}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ji}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Every neuron has an elliptic shape with a varying size.
* Positive definite matrix, but not diagonal.

==Training==

Training HyperBF networks involves estimation of weights &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt;, shape and centers of neurons &lt;math&gt;R_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;. Poggio and Girosi (1990) describe the training method with moving centers and adaptable neuron shapes. The outline of the method is provided below.

Consider the quadratic loss of the network &lt;math&gt;H[\phi^*]=\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i-\phi^* (x_i))^2&lt;/math&gt;.  The following conditions must be satisfied at the optimum:
 
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial H(\phi^*)}{\partial a_j}=0     &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial H(\phi^*)}{\partial \mu_j}=0     &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial H(\phi^*)}{\partial W}=0    &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_j=W^TW&lt;/math&gt;. Then in the gradient descent method the values of &lt;math&gt;a_j, \mu_j, W&lt;/math&gt; that minimize &lt;math&gt;H[\phi^*]&lt;/math&gt; can be found as a stable fixed point of the following dynamic system:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\dot{a_j}=-\omega\frac{\partial H(\phi^*)}{\partial a_j}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mu_j}=-\omega\frac{\partial H(\phi^*)}{\partial \mu_j}     &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{W}=-\omega\frac{\partial H(\phi^*)}{\partial W}    &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; determines the rate of convergence.

Overall, training HyperBF networks can be computationally challenging. Moreover, the high degree of freedom of HyperBF leads to overfitting and poor generalization. However, HyperBF networks have an important advantage that a small number of neurons is enough for learning complex functions.&lt;ref name="Mahdi"/&gt;

'''Idealistic pluralism''' is a philosophical position that suggests while an individual's understanding of the world might be limited to only the ideas within his or her mind, it can be known in this way by more than one mind.

Idealistic pluralism rejects the idea of [[solipsism]], which would be an [[idealistic monism]].  In the philosophy of [[George Berkeley]], an idealistic pluralism is found in his assertion that many minds (each knowing the world though their own representations) exist, separate from each other, and from God.

'''Italian submarine ''Dagabur''''' was an {{sclass-|Adua|submarine}} built for the [[Royal Italian Navy]] (''Regia Marina'') during the 1930s. It was named after a town of [[Degehabur|Dagabur]] in eastern [[Ethiopia]].

==Design and description==
The ''Adua''-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding {{sclass-|Perla|submarine|4}}. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|680|t|LT|sp=us}} surfaced and {{convert|844|t|LT|sp=us}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|60.18|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|6.45|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.7|m|ftin|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, pp. 309–10&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|600|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|400|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|7.5|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the ''Adua'' class had a range of {{convert|3180|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10.5|kn}}, submerged, they had a range of {{convert|74|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|4|kn}}.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were armed with six internal {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, four in the bow and two in the stern. One reload torpedo was carried for each tube, for a total of twelve. They were also armed with one [[Škoda 10 cm K10#OTO 100.2F47 History|{{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}]] [[deck gun]] for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of [[Breda Model 1931 Machine Gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}}]]  machine guns.&lt;ref name=c5/&gt;

==Construction and career==

''Dagabur'' was built at the [[Cantieri navali Tosi di Taranto|Tosi]] shipyard in [[Taranto]]. She was laid down on 16 April 1936, launched on 22 November of the same year, and commissioned on 9 April 1937. On April 25, 1937 she was assigned to 43rd Submarine Squadron in [[Taranto]]. During 1937 she carried out training and exercises in the [[Dodecanese]] and [[Libya]]. Between August and September of 1937 she performed three missions during the Spanish Civil War. During the first one, on Aug. 13, 1937 ''Dagabur'' attacked a ship but missed it. In 1938 she was reassigned to [[Tobruk]], and in 1940 she returned to Italy, and was assigned to 46th Squadron (IV Submarine Group) based first at [[Taranto]] and then at [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]].

After [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s entrance into [[World War II]], ''Dagabur'' under command of captain Domenico Romano, was engaged in various defensive missions, mainly anti-submarine, in the [[Gulf of Taranto]] and off the coasts of [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]]. She did not encounter any enemy units during these missions. 

On January 1, 1941 ''Dagabur'' commenced her patrol off Cyrenaica coast lasting until January 12, but it proved to be uneventful.&lt;ref name=bert&gt;Bertke, p.243&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 1941 she unsuccessfully patrolled off Malta.&lt;ref name=bert1&gt;Bertke, p.291&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 1941, ''Dagabur'' along with two other submarines, was sent to patrol between [[Alexandria]] and [[Cape Krio]]. These three submarines were a part of the screening force covering main Italian battle formation involved in the Operation "Gaudo". At 20:27 on March 30 ''Dagabur'' sighted in the position {{Coord|33|47|N|25|24|E}} light cruiser {{HMS|Bonaventure|31|6}} escorting, along with three destroyers, two transports. Being in ideal position for attack, at 20:37 she launched two torpedoes, and heard two strong explosions. There were no news of the result of this attack and it's likely the cruiser was damaged, but hours later, {{HMS|Bonaventure|31|6}} was torpedoed again, this time, by the submarine ''Ambra'' and sunk with a loss of 23 officers and 115 other members of the crew.

On December 14, 1941 ''Dagabur'', now under command of captain Alberto Torri, intercepted while surfaced, and launched two torpedoes at an unknown unit, and immediately disengaging by diving. From the British documentation, it was later learned that the unit attacked was British submarine ''Talisman'', which did not sustain any damage and it reacted with the launch of two torpedoes and deck gun fire, but also with no results.

At the beginning of August 1942 ''Dagabur'', now under command of captain Renato Pecori, left [[Cagliari]] and was sent to patrol an area between [[Ibiza]] and [[Mallorca]] and northern coast of Algeria. On August 10, 1942 she was ordered to report sightings of enemy units, but not attack any ships until after the start of the British [[Operation Pedestal|Operation "Pedestal"]]. On August 11, 1942 she sighted British Force, part of Operation "Bellows", including British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} and eight destroyers south of the [[Balearic Islands]]. ''Dagabur'' attempted to maneuver into approach on the surface but was spotted and attacked and rammed by destroyer {{HMS|Wolverine|D78|6}} and sank with all hands in the position {{Coord|37|18|N|1|58|E}} on August 12 &lt;ref name=g5&gt;Gretton,pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;. {{HMS|Wolverine|D78|6}} was also damaged in the collision, and had to be escorted back to [[Gibraltar]] for repairs.

'''Joseph Wanton Morrison''' (4 May 1783 – 15 February 1826) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] soldier, best known for commanding the British troops at the [[Battle of Crysler's Farm]] during the [[War of 1812]].

==Early career==
Morrison was born in [[New York City|New York]] (which was then under British occupation in the final days of the [[American War of Independence]]), the son of a senior [[Commissariat]] officer. He joined the British Army as an [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] in 1793, and was present as a [[Lieutenant]] in the [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] in 1799, where he was severely wounded at the [[Battle of Egmont-op-Zee]].

He was promoted rapidly through [[Sale of commissions|purchase]] and in 1808, he was in command of the 2nd Battalion of the [[89th (The Princess Victoria's) Regiment of Foot|89th Foot]] in [[Ireland]] as a [[Major]]. Inspecting field officers commented favourably both on the battalion and on Morrison himself. In November 1809, he exchanged into the [[1st West India Regiment]] to gain promotion to [[Lieutenant-Colonel]], serving in [[Trinidad]]. In July, 1811, he returned to the 2/89th as its commanding officer. The battalion was stationed in [[Gibraltar]] in 1812 when war broke out between Britain and the [[United States]], and it was despatched to reinforce the British troops in [[Canada]].

==Battle of Crysler's Farm==
In October 1813, the 2/89th were stationed at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] in [[Upper Canada]] when news arrived that a large American force was descending the [[Saint Lawrence River]], intent on attacking [[Montreal]]. Morrison was placed in command of a ''Corps of Observation'' which included his own battalion, and was ordered to pursue and harass this American army. His force, numbering 900 and supported by [[gunboat]]s under Captain [[William Mulcaster]], was encamped at [[Crysler's Farm]] on 11 November. Major General [[James Wilkinson]], commanding the American army, determined to drive Morrison's force away before proceeding further down the river. On favourable ground and using the classic British tactics of fighting in line and firing deliberate controlled volleys, Morrison's troops easily repulsed the American attack, even though outnumbered three to one, and captured a 6-pounder gun which the Americans abandoned as they retreated.

==Later career and death==
In July 1814, Morrison was severely wounded at the [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]], and saw no further action in the War of 1812, although he was a member of the [[court martial]] board which tried Major General [[Henry Procter (British Army officer)|Henry Procter]] for negligence following the defeat at the [[Battle of Moraviantown]].

After the war, he transferred to the deactivated [[Sicilian Regiment]] and went on half pay until 1821. He then became Lieutenant-Colonel of the [[44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot|44th Foot]], which was posted to [[Calcutta]] in [[India]]. He was promoted to [[Brigadier-General]] to command a brigade in an expedition to the [[province of Arakan]] during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1824. Although the expedition was successful, Arakan was notorious for malaria and other diseases, and Morrison and many of his men fell ill with tropical fever. He died at sea on the voyage back to Britain.

In early 1809 he had married Elizabeth Hester Marriott of [[Worcester]]. He and his wife had no children.

'''King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women''' ('''KEMH''') is a hospital located in [[Subiaco, Western Australia|Subiaco]], [[Western Australia]]. It is Western Australia's largest [[maternity hospital]] and only referral centre for complex pregnancies.

It provides [[pregnancy]] and [[neonatal]] care within the greater [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] Metropolitan area. In cases  where patients have gone to private maternity clinics, they may  be moved to KEMH if complications occur. All cases of complicated pregnancy in Western Australia are transferred to KEMH by the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]].

==History==
In 1909, a meeting was convened in Perth by the [[Women's Service Guilds]] to discuss the establishment of a new maternity hospital.  At the time in Perth, there were only a few private maternity clinics, and charitable organizations providing services to the poor, but no dedicated public maternity hospital facilities.  The main outcome of the 1909 meeting was to appoint a committee to pursue the matter, jointly chaired by [[Edith Cowan]] and Jane Scott.  Between 1910 and 1915 the committee wrangled with the government and raised funds to support the establishment of a hospital.  Plans were suggested for building an extra ward at the Perth Public Hospital, or as an adjunct to the Home of Mercy in Lincoln Street, but eventually the site of the Industrial School in Subiaco was chosen.

The hospital was named the King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women as a lasting memorial to King [[Edward VII]], who died in 1910.&lt;ref name=KEMHHist&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=B.C.|last2=Hutchison|first2=R.L.|title=A history of the King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women : the first fifty years, 1916 to 1966|year=1966|publisher=King Edward Memorial Hospital|place=Subiaco, Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital commenced operating on 14 July 1916. 101 babies were born in the first 6 months of operation.  At the time, the hospital charged a standard fee of £3 3s for 'confinement' and fourteen days of post-natal care.&lt;ref name=KEMHHist&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the organisational structure for King Edward Memorial Hospital and the [[Princess Margaret Hospital for Children]] were integrated, although separate locations were maintained.  In 2002 the organisation was renamed Women's and Children's Health Service. In 2006, the two hospitals were once again separated.&lt;ref name="dohmedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.wa.gov.au/press/view_press.cfm?id=591 |title=Women and children to benefit from health service realignment |publisher=Department of Health – Government of Western Australia |date=30 May 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ALIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conferences.alia.org.au/online2003/papers/scolaro.html |title=A One-Stop Shop for Information for the Women's and Children's Health Service |author=Tricia Scolaro and Helen Archer |publisher=[[Australian Library and Information Association]] |date=14 October 2003 |accessdate=2008-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726163932/http://conferences.alia.org.au/online2003/papers/scolaro.html |archivedate=26 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; King Edward Memorial Hospital is now home of the state's Women and Newborn Health Service, as part of the North Metropolitan Health Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmahs.health.wa.gov.au/Services/Other.html |title=NMHS Hospitals |publisher=Department of Health – Government of Western Australia |accessdate=2013-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5763">'''Kurt Schork''' (January 24, 1947 – May 24, 2000) was an American [[reporter]] and [[war correspondent]]. He was killed in an [[ambush]] while on an assignment for [[Reuters]] in [[Sierra Leone]] together with cameraman [[Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora]] of Spain, who worked for [[Associated Press]] Television. Two other Reuters journalists, South African cameraman Mark Chisholm and Greek photographer [[Yannis Behrakis]] were injured in the attack in which Schork died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/bosnia-love-story-sarajevo-war/24990732.html|title=Twenty Years On: The Unfinished Lives Of Bosnia’s Romeo And Juliet|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kurt Schork was born in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He graduated from [[Jamestown College]] in 1969, and studied at [[Oxford University]] as a [[Rhodes scholar]] later that year—the same time as future United States President [[Bill Clinton]]. Schork worked as a property developer, a political adviser, and then chief of staff for the [[New York City Transit Authority]] before becoming a journalist.

Kurt Schork covered numerous conflicts and wars, including The [[Balkans]],  and in [[Iraq]], [[Chechnya]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[East Timor]].

He filed the story ''Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo'', about a young couple, Boško Brkić and Admira Ismić, an Eastern Orthodox Bosnian Serb and Muslim Bosniak girl killed during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/Bosnia/updates/9604/10/|title=CNN - 'Only a bullet' could separate them - Apr. 10, 1996|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|4WXfR3gOPAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admira's and Boško's relationship defied the ethnic hatred which followed the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. After being shot and killed by a sniper while attempting to flee the area, their bodies remained unreachable on a bridge in no man's land for eight days as the war raged on. They became known as Romeo and Juliet as the story of their unshakable love emerged. Before they made the decision to flee, the young couple were serving as surrogate parents to the young sons of Admira's cousin, Brana, who was killed in Sarajevo by a 60-millimeter shell while putting her sons to sleep. Boško's decision to flee with Admira was influenced by the fact that his grandfather was summoned in Croatia to a police station by pro-Hitler Fascists during World War II and never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/programs/transcripts/1217.html|title=FRONTLINE: previous reports: transcripts: romeo and juliet in sarajevo - PBS|author=Entropy Media|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Schork died, as per his personal wishes, upon cremation half of his ashes was buried next to his mother in [[Washington, D.C.]], and half at "Groblje Lav" ''(The Lion Cemetery)'' in [[Sarajevo]], next to the grave of Boško and Admira, the central figures in Schork's acclaimed story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/863587.stm|title=BBC News - EUROPE - Kurt Schork buried in Sarajevo|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Schork has been memorialized posthumously in: the dedication of Kurt Schork Street in [[Sarajevo]], and citizenship of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]: in the dedication of the Kurt Schork newsroom at Jamestown College, his alma mater; and in the documentary [[Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|jnQ1lTAVjhw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kurt Schork Memorial Fund and Awards==
The goal of the Kurt Schork Memorial Fund and Awards recognizes and assist freelance and local journalists who make a critical contribution to international understanding but whose work is often overlooked. The awards include two cash prizes of $5,000 each to provide some financial support to help the winners continue reporting. Though local journalists in the developing world take extraordinary risks to expose corruption and injustice in their countries, they rarely earn enough money to support themselves and their families. Similarly, freelancers live from job to job, never knowing when the next assignment will come, where it may lead or how long it will last. With these awards, the Fund spotlights the plight and achievements of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksmfund.org/|title=Kurt Schork Memorial Fund|work=ksmfund.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1070">'''Leoniders''' (леонидяне) are a fictional alien race from the [[Noon Universe]] created by the [[Boris and Arkady Strugatsky|Strugatsky brothers]]. Their homeworld is [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Leonida|Leonida]] (Леонида), a planet discovered in 2133 AD by [[Leonid Gorbovsky]].

Leoniders are mentioned in ''"[[Noon: 22nd Century]]"'', ''"[[An Attempt to Escape]]"'' and ''"[[Beetle in an Anthill]]"''.

== Appearance ==
Leoniders are [[humanoids]] like [[humans (Noon Universe)|humans]] but somewhat smaller.

== Technological advancement ==
The term "technological advancеment" is not very appropriate to Leoniders since their "technology" is very different from humanity's. It is known, for example, that they live in a perfect [[symbiosis]] with major forms of [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] of Leonida.

== Leoniders and Humans ==
No data available despite the continuous diplomatic contact between Leonida and Earth.

Repeated studies have shown that [[Major League Baseball]] players have a greater [[life expectancy]] than males in the general U.S. population — about five years more, on average, which is attributed to their superior fitness and healthy lifestyles. The longer the active career, the longer the player lives, on average. This correlation is attributed to the maintenance of fitness and increased wealth.{{sfn|Saint Onge|Rogers|Krueger|2008}}

&lt;!--  This is not a catch-all list - incidents were cut down to only include death tolls of 10 or more people - please goto talk to comment before adding an incident of less than 10 people  --&gt;
&lt;!--  This list excludes massacres perpetrated by a single person-this is a problem by different users having different views on the definition of massacre --&gt;
This is a partial '''list of [[massacre]]s in the [[United States]]'''; it excludes single-perpetrator massacres; death tolls may be approximate.

While we cannot anticipate this result but with painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power or wisdom of man to avert."&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous books have been written on the subject of the California Indian genocide such as ''Genocide and Vendetta: The Round Valley Wars in Northern California'' by Lynwood Carranco and Estle Beard, ''Murder State: California's Native American Genocide, 1846-1873'' by Brendan C. Lindsay, and ''An American Genocide: The United States and the California Indian Catastrophe, 1846-1873'' by Benjamin Madley among others.

'''NeuronStudio''' is a non-commercial program created at [[Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai]] by the Computational Neurobiology and Imaging Center. This program performs automatic tracing and reconstruction of neuron structures from confocal image stacks. The resulting model can then be exported to a file using standard formats for further processing, modeling, or for statistical analyses.

[[Image:Neuronstudio3.jpg|right|frame|The NeuronStudio graphical user interface (Windows version).]]

The system handles morphologic details on scales spanning local spine geometry through complex tree topology to the gross spatial arrangement of multi-neuron networks. NeuronStudio's capability for automated digitization avoids the subjective errors that arise during manual tracing.

== Deconvolution ==
[[Deconvolution]] of imaged data is essential for accurate 3D reconstructions. Deconvolution is an image restoration approach where 'a priori' knowledge of the optical system in the form of a [[point spread function]] (PSF) is used to obtain a better estimate of the object. A point spread function can be either calculated from the actual microscope parameters, measured with beads, or estimated and iteratively refined ([Blind Deconvolution]). PSFs can be adjusted locally to account for variations in refractive characteristics of the tissue with depth and sample characteristics. For automated use with large, tiled tissue blocks, this is faster and more accurate than using an experimentally determined [[Progressive segmented frame|PSF]].

== Skeletonization and diameter estimation ==

Quantization errors arise in standard [[skeletonization]] algorithms from the integer nature of digital images. The requirement for accurate representation of fine dendritic geometry has required the development of novel adaptations of standard skeletonization and diameter estimation algorithms to correct for these quantization errors. Iterative thinning skeletonization methods can provide a distance in [[voxel]]s from each tree node to the surface of the object. This distance is the D6 metric, obtained by counting the number of voxels as they are removed in the minimal 6-connected path from the surface to the medial axis. In existing skeletonization or vectorization algorithms for dendritic morphometry, the branch cross-section at any node is approximated as circular, with the D6 metric providing the single diameter estimate. The precision of this diameter estimate is limited to the physical size of the voxels. For small structures such as thin [[dendrite]]s and spines, comprising only a few voxels even at maximal imaging resolution, the error can be significant if this measure is used directly (see figure). To minimize quantization error and evaluate more precisely the geometry of the nodes, a new estimation technique exists, the Rayburst Sampling Algorithm that uses the original [[grayscale]] data rather than the segmented images for precise, continuous radius estimation, and multidirectional radius sampling to more accurately represent non-circular branch cross-sections and non-spherical spine heads.

== Rayburst algorithm ==
[[Image:Rayburst.jpg|rught|frame|3D Representation of the Rayburst sampling core.]]
The Rayburst Sampling Algorithm uses the original grayscale data rather than the segmented images for precise, continuous radius estimation, and multidirectional radius sampling to more accurately represent non-circular branch cross-sections and non-spherical spine heads. The algorithm precomputes an array of unit vectors which sample the data in multiple directions, (the Sampling Core) from which an estimate of the node's geometry is computed. Accurate representation of each direction by the sampling core requires that the ''N'' vectors should be uniformly spaced over the unit sphere. The algorithm uses a [[particle physics]] simulation in which a set ''N'' of randomly oriented unit vectors is generated, resulting in a random, nonuniform distribution of points on the sphere. Each particle then receives a repulsive force from every other particle, proportional to the inverse square of the distance between them. By iteratively displacing the particle in the direction of the resultant forces, the particles rearrange themselves. This system will tend to a stable, minimum energy configuration within approximately 40 iterations, where each particle is maximally separated from its closest neighbors. The information can be used to reconstruct 3D branches of arbitrarily irregular shapes. The diameter of an equivalent circular cross-section is computed in the plane normal to the medial axis using the Median Lower Band Diameter (MLBD). To compute the MLBD, take the set of samples and add the corresponding pairs of opposite vectors. Sort the vectors by size, define the lower band as the lower 50%, and use the distance at position N/4, representing the median of the lower band, to estimate the diameter.

'''Neuron''' is a simulation environment for modeling individual and networks of [[neurons]]. It was primarily developed by Michael Hines, [[John Wilson Moore|John W. Moore]], and Ted Carnevale at [[Yale]] and [[Duke University|Duke]].

Neuron models individual neurons via the use of sections that are automatically subdivided into individual compartments, instead of requiring the user to manually create compartments. The primary scripting language is [[Hoc (programming language)|hoc]] but a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] interface is also available. Programs can be written interactively in a shell, or loaded from a file. Neuron supports parallelization via the [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] protocol.

Neuron is capable of handling diffusion-reaction models, and integrating diffusion functions into models of synapses and cellular networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/node/85|title=New release of NEURON includes reactive diffusion! - NEURON|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallelization is possible via internal multithreaded routines, for use on multi-core computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.neuron.yale.edu/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=1476#p5263|title=www.neuron.yale.edu • View topic - NEURON 7.0 now available|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The properties of the membrane channels of the neuron are simulated using compiled mechanisms written using the NMODL language or by compiled routines operating on internal data structures that are set up with Channel Builder.

Along with the analogous software platform [[GENESIS (software)|GENESIS]], Neuron is the basis for instruction in [[computational neuroscience]] in many courses and laboratories around the world.

== User interface ==
Neuron features a [[Graphical user interface|graphical user interace]] (GUI), for use by individuals with minimal programming experience. The GUI comes equipped with a builder for single and multiple compartment cells, networks, network cells, channels and linear electric circuits. Single and multiple compartment cells differ in that multiple compartment cells features several "sections", each with potentially distinct parameters for dimensions and kinetics. Tutorials are available on the Neuron website, including for getting basic models out of the cell, channel and network builders.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} With these builders, the user can form the basis of all simulations and models.

===Cell Builder===
[[File:Cell_builder_menu_in_the_Neuron_GUI_displaying_six_options_for_cell_generation.jpg|thumb|The cell builder menu with the six options visible]]
Cell Builder allows the user to generate and modify stick figure cell structures. These sections form the basis of functionally distinct areas of the neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/cbtut/stylized/topol.html|title=Specify topology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The user can define functionally distinct groups of sections. Sections branching from one another can be labeled "dendrites," while another, single section that projects from the same central one can be labeled as the "axon." The user can define parameters along which certain values are variable as a function across a section. For instance, path length along a subset can be defined as a domain, the functions along which can then be defined later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/cbtut/stylized/subsets.html|title=Specify subsets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/cbtut/parameterized/setsdi.html|title=Set up a SubsetDomainIterator|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The user can select either individual sections, or groups and set precise parameters for length, diameter, area and length for that group or section. Any of these values can be set as a function of length or some other parameter of the corresponding section. The user can set the number of functional segments in a section, which is a strategy for spatial resolution. The higher the number of segments, the more precisely Neuron can handle a function in a section. Segments are the points where point process managers can be associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/cbtut/stylized/geom.html|title=Specify geometry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users can define kinetic and electro-physiological functions across both subsets and sections. Neuron comes equipped with a probabilistic model of [[Hodgkin-Huxley Model]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model#Ionic_current_characterization Hodgkin-Huxley ionic current characterization]&lt;/ref&gt; giant squid axon kinetics, as well as a function to model passive [[leak channel]] kinetics. Both of these functions, and the features they describe, can be added to the membrane of the constructed cell. Values for leak rate, sodium conductance and potassium conductance can be set for modeling these kinetics can be set as functions over a parameterized domain. Channels become available for implementation in a cell membrane.

===Channel Builder===
The user can generate both [[Voltage-gated ion channel|voltage]]- and [[Ligand-gated ion channel|ligand-gated channel]] models. Channel Builder supports local point channels, generally used for single, large channels whose function is to be modeled, and general channels whose density across the cell can be defined. Maximum conductance, reversal potential, ligand sensitivity, ion permeability, as well as precise dynamics of transitional states using activation and inactivation variables, and including differential conductance, can be defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/chanlbild/hhstyle/outline.html|title=Creating a channel from an HH-style specification|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network and Network Cell Builder===
Neuron allows for the generation of mixed models, populated with both artificial cells and neurons. Artificial cells essentially function as point processes, implemented into the network. Artificial cells require only a point process, with defined parameters. The user can create the structure and dynamics of network cells. The user can create synapses, using simulated synapse point processes as archetypes. Parameters on these point processes can be manipulated to simulate both inhibitory and excitatory responses. Synapses can be placed on specific segments of the constructed cell, wherein, again, they will behave as point processes, except that they are sensitive to the activity of a pre-synaptic element. Cells can be managed. The user creates the basic grid of network cells, taking previously completed network cells as archetypes. Connections can be defined between source cells and target synapses on other cells. The cell containing the target synapse becomes the post-synaptic element, whereas the source cells function as pre-synaptic elements. Weights can be added to define strength of activation of a synapse by the pre-synaptic cell. A plot option can be activated to open a graph of spikes across time for individual neurons.

===Simulation and recording===
Neuron comes equipped with a slew of simulation tools. Most notably, it includes several "point processes," which are simple functions at a particular segment of a cell. Point processes include simulations of [[Voltage clamp|voltage]], [[Patch clamp|patch]], [[Voltage clamp#Single-electrode voltage clamp|single electrode]] and [[Current clamp|current]] clamps, as well as several simulated synapses. Synapse point processes are distinct for their ability to model stimulation intensities that vary non-linearly across time. These can be placed on any segment of any section of a built cell, individual or network, and their precise values, including amplitude and duration of stimulation, delay time of activation in a run and time decay parameters (for synapses), can be defined from the point process manager module. When implemented into a network as synapses, point process parameters are defined in the synapse builder for a particular network cell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/help/neuron/neuron/mech.html#pointprocesses PointProcess documentation]&lt;/ref&gt; Graphs describing voltage, conductance, and current axes over time can be used to describe changes in electrical state at the location of any segment on the cell.  Neuron allows for graphs of change at both individual points over time, and across an entire section through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/netbuild/hybrid/plotwhat.html|title=Plotting Variables from Biophysical Cell Models in a Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/cbtut/parameterized/usemodel.html|title=Use the model specification|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duration of run can be set. All point processes, including those standing for cells or synapses of artificial neurons, and all graphs reflect the duration.

==Examples==
This example creates a simple cell, with a single compartment [[Soma (biology)|soma]] and a multi compartment [[axon]]. It has the dynamics of the cell membrane simulated using [[Squid giant axon|Hodgkin-Huxley squid axon]] kinetics. The simulator stimulates the cell and runs for 50 ms.

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
//create two sections, the body of the neuron and a very long axon
create soma, axon

soma {
	//length is set to 100 micrometers	
	L = 100
	//diameter is set to 100 micrometers
	diam = 100
	//insert a mechanism simulating the standard squid Hodgkin–Huxley channels
	insert hh
	//insert a mechanism simulating the passive membrane properties
	insert pas
}
axon {
	L = 5000
	diam = 10
	insert hh
	insert pas
	//the axon shall be simulated using 10 compartments. By default a single compartment is used
	nseg = 10
}

//connect the proximal end of the axon to the distal end of the soma
connect axon(0), soma(1)

//declare and insert a current clamp into the middle of the soma
objref stim
soma stim = new IClamp(0.5)

//define some parameters of the stimulus: delay, duration (both in ms) and amplitude (in nA)
stim.del = 10
stim.dur = 5
stim.amp = 10

//load a default NEURON library file that defines the run routine
load_file("stdrun.hoc")
//set the simulation to run for 50 ms
tstop = 50

//run the simulation
run()
&lt;/source&gt;

A plot can be generated showing the voltage traces starting from the soma and the distal end of the axon. The [[action potential]] at the end of the axon arrives slightly later than it appears in the soma at the point of stimulation. The plot is membrane voltage versus time.

'''Neurovation Labs, Inc.''' is a biotechnology company focused on diagnosing and treating anxiety disorders and in particular [[Posttraumatic Stress Disorder]] ([[PTSD]]).

Neurovation Labs, formed in 2016 and based in New York City, grew out of the research performed by Drs. [[Michael Fanselow]] and Jennifer Perusini that sought to understand the cause of PTSD on a physiological level. They discovered that PTSD is manifested through enduring increases in a certain protein ([[glutamate receptor]] subunit GluA1 or [[GRIA1]]) in the [[basolateral amygdala]], which is a region of the brain central to fear learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/npp.2015.224 |pmid=26329286 |pmc=4677128 |title=Induction and Expression of Fear Sensitization Caused by Acute Traumatic Stress |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=45–57 |year=2015 |last1=Perusini |first1=Jennifer N |last2=Meyer |first2=Edward M |last3=Long |first3=Virginia A |last4=Rau |first4=Vinuta |last5=Nocera |first5=Nathaniel |last6=Avershal |first6=Jacob |last7=Maksymetz |first7=James |last8=Spigelman |first8=Igor |last9=Fanselow |first9=Michael S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This protein increase provides the first possible objective indicator of PTSD. The discovery was made using a robust and valid model of PTSD in rodents, stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL). The company is currently developing a PTSD diagnostic and a companion treatment based on these discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurovationlabs.com/company-overview |title=Company Overview |publisher=Neurovation Labs |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Perusini is current CEO of Neurovation Labs. Dr. Fanselow currently acts as Director of Research and Richard Zemsky, J.D. is COO/ in-house counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurovationlabs.com/team |title=Team |publisher=Neurovation Labs |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Neurovation Labs closed a seed funding round. The financing was completed with the support of individual angel investors based in the United States. The company intends to use the proceeds to further the development of its patent-pending PTSD diagnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161024006131/en/Neurovation-Labs-Secures-Seed-Funding-Post-traumatic-Stress |title=Neurovation Labs, Inc. Secures Seed Funding for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Diagnostic |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |date=2016-10-24 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, Neurovation Labs launched PTSD Authority, a public service website that provides information, a resource and treatment guide, and interactive forums for all those affected by PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ptsdauthority.com/ |title=PTSD Authority |publisher=PTSD Authority |date= |accessdate=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9161">'''Numerical algebraic geometry''' is a field of [[computational mathematics]], particularly [[computational algebraic geometry]], which uses methods from [[numerical analysis]] to study and manipulate algebraic varieties on a computer.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Hauenstein, Andrew J. Sommese, What is numerical algebraic geometry?, Journal of Symbolic Computation, Volume 79, Part 3, March–April 2017, pages 499–507&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www3.nd.edu/~cwample1/Preprints/intro2AlgGeom.pdf |title=Introduction to Numerical Algebraic Geometry |last=Sommese |first=Andrew J. |last2=Verschelde |first2=Jan |last3=Wampler |first3=Charles W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Homotopy continuation==
{{see also|System of polynomial equations#Homotopy continuation}}
{{see also|Numerical continuation}}
The primary computational method used in numerical algebraic geometry is homotopy continuation, in which a [[homotopy]] is formed between two polynomial systems, and the isolated solutions (points) of one are continued to the other. This is a specification of the more general method of [[numerical continuation]].

Let &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; represent the variables of the system.  By abuse of notation, and to facilitate the spectrum of ambient spaces over which one can solve system, we do not use vector notation for &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly for the polynomial systems &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

Current canonical notation calls the start system &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, and the target system – the system to solve – &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Sommese, Charles W. Wampler, The Numerical Solution of Systems of Polynomials Arising in Engineering and Science, World Scientific, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Bates, Jonathan D. Hauenstein, Andrew J. Sommese, Charles W. Wampler, Numerically solving polynomial systems with Bertini, SIAM, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  A very common homotopy, the straight-line homotopy, between &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math display="block"&gt; H(z,t) = (1-t) f(z) + t g(z).&lt;/math&gt;

In the above homotopy, one starts the path variable at &lt;math&gt;t_{\text{start}} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and continues toward &lt;math&gt;t_{\text{end}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Another common choice is to run from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.  In principle, the choice is completely arbitrary.  In practice, regarding endgame methods for computing singular solutions using homotopy continuation, the target time being &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; can significantly ease analysis, so this perspective is here taken.{{Citation needed|reason=need a citation indicating that the analysis is actually easier with target time 0|date=January 2017}}  

Regardless of the choice of start and target times, the &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; ought to be formulated such that &lt;math&gt;H(z, t_{\text{start}}) = g(z)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;H(z, t_{\text{end}}) = f(z)&lt;/math&gt;.

One has a choice in &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt;, including

* Roots of unity
* Total degree
* Polyhedral
* Multi-homogeneous

and beyond these, specific [[Start system|start systems]] that closely mirror the structure of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; may be formed for particular systems.  The choice of start system impacts the computational time it takes to solve &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, in that those that are easy to formulate (such as total degree) tend to have higher numbers of paths to track, and those that take significant effort (such as the polyhedral method) are much sharper.  There is currently no good way to predict which will lead to the quickest time to solve.{{Citation needed|reason=need a source indicating this please|date=January 2017}}

Actual continuation is typically done using [[predictor–corrector method]]s, with additional features as implemented.  Predicting is done using a standard [[ordinary differential equation|ODE]] predictor method, such as [[Runge–Kutta]], and correction often uses Newton–Raphson iteration.

Because &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are polynomial, homotopy continuation in this context is theoretically guaranteed to compute all solutions of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, due to [[Theorem of Bertini|Bertini's theorem]].  However, this guarantee is not always achieved in practice, because of issues arising from limitations of the modern computer, most namely finite precision.  That is, despite the strength of the probability-1 argument underlying this theory, without using a priori certified tracking methods, some paths may fail to track perfectly for various reasons.

==Witness set==
A witness set 
&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a data structure used to describe [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]]. The witness set for an affine variety that is equidimensional consists of three pieces of information. The first piece of information is a system of equations &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. These equations define the algebraic variety &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt; that is being studied. The second piece of information is a linear space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;. The dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the codimension of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt;, and chosen to intersect &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt; transversely. The third piece of information is the list of points in the intersection &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\cap{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt;. This intersection has finitely many points and the number of points is the degree of the algebraic variety &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf V}(F)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, witness sets encode the answer to the first two questions one asks about an algebraic variety: What is the dimension, and what is the degree? Witness sets also allow one to perform a numerical irreducible decomposition, component membership tests, and component sampling. This makes witness sets a good description of an algebraic variety.

==Certification==

Solutions to polynomial systems computed using numerical algebraic geometric methods can be certified, meaning that the approximate solution is "correct".  This can be achieved in several ways, either a priori using a certified tracker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beltrán|first=Carlos|last2=Leykin|first2=Anton|date=2012-03-01|title=Certified Numerical Homotopy Tracking|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2011.606184|journal=Experimental Mathematics|volume=21|issue=1|pages=69–83|doi=10.1080/10586458.2011.606184|issn=1058-6458|arxiv=0912.0920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beltrán|first=Carlos|last2=Leykin|first2=Anton|date=2013-02-01|title=Robust Certified Numerical Homotopy Tracking|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-013-9143-2|journal=Foundations of Computational Mathematics|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=253–295|doi=10.1007/s10208-013-9143-2|issn=1615-3375|arxiv=1105.5992}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a posteriori by showing that the point is, say, in the basin of convergence for Newton's method.&lt;ref name = "alphaCertified"&gt;Hauenstein, Jonathan D., and Sottile, Frank.

==Theorem Star==
Often researchers use results from both probabilistic symbolic computations and numerical computations to prove theorems. The notation ''Theorem Star'' is often used to indicate the reliance on such computations. 
     ''Our methods include probabilistic symbolic computations and numerical computations. Though they have been carefully tested and produce completely reproducible results, they are technically only true with high probability, or up to the numerical precision of the computers we use. To indicate reliance on such computations, we designate those theorems, corollaries, and propositions with a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oeding|first1=Luke|last2=Sam|first2=Steven|title=Equations for the fifth secant variety of Segre products of projective spaces|journal=Experimental Mathematics|date=2016|volume=25|issue=1|page=94--99|doi=10.1080/10586458.2015.1037872|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10586458.2015.1037872|arxiv=1502.00203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Kester''' (November 2, 1870 – June 21, 1933) was an American playwright and novelist. He was the younger brother of journalist [[Vaughan Kester]] and a cousin of the literary editor and critic [[William Dean Howells]].

==Life and career==
Kester was born in 1870, some 30 miles north of Columbus at [[Delaware, Ohio]].&lt;ref name = "NYPL"&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/archivalcollections/pdf/kesterp.pdf Paul Kester Papers. NYPL] accessed September 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was the younger of two sons raised by Franklin "Frank" Cooley and Harriet (née Watkins) Kester. His father was traveling salesman, and mother an art teacher who in 1882 helped found the [[Cleveland School of Art]]. Kester was educated by home tutors and at private schools where he excelled in the dramatic arts.&lt;ref name = "NYPL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank and Harriet Kester; Mount Vernon, OH. 1870 US Census; Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://souther319.clevelandhistory.org/2012/04/10/the-cleveland-institute-of-art/ The Cleveland Institute of Art] accessed September 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

His first success came in January 1892 with ''Countess Roudine'', which premiered in Philadelphia at the [[Chestnut Street Theatre]] and opened a week later at the [[Union Square Theatre]] in New York City. ''Countess Roudine'' was a collaborative effort written with the actress [[Minnie Maddern Fiske]].&lt;ref name = "NYPL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TzwOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA341 Adams, William Davenport – A Dictionary of the Drama: a Guide to the Plays, Play-wrights; Volume 1; 1904; pg. 341] accessed September 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "NYT"&gt;Paul Kester Dead, Writer of Dramas. The New York Times; June 21, 1933; pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896 his adaptation of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s ''Eugene Aram'' was produced by [[Walker Whiteside| Walker Whiteside's]] company and in 1902 with [[George Middleton (playwright)|George Middleton]] adapted the [[George W. Cable]] Southern romance ''The Cavalier'' that was staged at the [[Criterion Theatre]] with [[Julia Marlowe]]. Actress [[Annie Russell]] produced and starred in his 1906 [[Quaker]] tale ''Friend Hannah'', written with the help of his brother, Vaughan.&lt;ref name = "NYPL" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NYT" /&gt;

Kester worked on nearly 30 plays over his career. His most successful Broadway effort was probably ''The Woman of Bronze'', which ran for 252 performances between September 1920 and April 1921 at Manhattan's [[Frazee Theatre]]. He also authored a number of books, with ''His Own Country'' (1917) most likely the more popular.&lt;ref name = "NYPL" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NYT" /&gt;

Described as shy and diffident,&lt;ref name = "NYT" /&gt; Kester preferred country life to that of the city. In 1902, with his brother, he purchased and renovated [[Woodlawn (plantation)|Woodlawn Plantation]] in Northern Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnymJjIRKasC&amp;pg=PA56|title=Mount Vernon, Arlington and Woodlawn|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later the two acquired nearby [[Gunston Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles11/virginia-homes-8.shtml|title=Gunston Hall|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Vaughan Kester died in 1911.

Kester spent his final years at [[Lake Mohegan, New York|Lake Mohegan]], a small community near Peekskill, New York. He died there in 1933 at the age of 62, a victim of [[thrombosis]]. At the time the closest surviving member of his family was the [[mezzo-soprano]] opera singer Florence Wickham, a cousin.&lt;ref name = "NYPL" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NYT" /&gt; He is buried in the graveyard at [[Pohick Church]], once the parish church of Gunston Hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{findagrave|15438378|Paul Kester}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is his mother;&lt;ref&gt;{{findagrave|15437032|Harriet Watkins "Hattie" Kester}}&lt;/ref&gt; at one time he had served as a member of the church [[vestry]].&lt;ref name="Virginia1911"&gt;{{cite book|author=Episcopal Church.

====''His Own Country''====
Kester spoke of his novel ''His Own Country'' in the aftermath of [[World War I]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Race problem is always with us, and as my story deals in a serious way with its more serious aspects, I do not think it can be untimely.  New phases of this great problem come up from day to day – but the problem itself is as old as history – very likely it will remain a problem to the end of history.  Racial differences and the prejudices resulting from them have always confronted practical statesmen.  The old method of dealing with them was by conquest, subjugation, or extermination.  Such methods are now obsolete.  Better ones must be found.  Understanding must precede intelligent action along any lines, and my reason – perhaps I would better say my justification – for writing ''His Own Country'' has been my hope and belief that it would bring some little considered phases of this menacing and mighty problem more clearly before the minds of readers who live remote from it, yet whose consent is necessary, as it should be in a democracy, to any adjustment of settlement of living conditions where the races are existing side by side.&lt;ref name="Chronicle and Comment, The Bookman"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="Home"===
&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to go home&lt;br&gt; To the dull old town&lt;br&gt; With the shaded streets&lt;br&gt; And the open square&lt;br&gt; And the hill&lt;br&gt; And the flats&lt;br&gt;And the house I love&lt;br&gt; And the paths I know -&lt;br&gt; I want to go home.&lt;br&gt; If I can't go back&lt;br&gt; To the happy days,&lt;br&gt; Yet I can live&lt;br&gt; Where their shadows lie,&lt;br&gt; Under the trees&lt;br&gt; And over the grass -&lt;br&gt;I want to be there&lt;br&gt; Where the joy was once.&lt;br&gt; Oh, I want to go home,&lt;br&gt; I want to go home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A65MAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA365 – Jerome, Barr, Lawrence and Sime – The Idler, Volume 20; 1902; pg.365] accessed September 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dover|title=Greek Homosexuality|date=1989|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674362616|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Pederasty in ancient Greece''' was a socially acknowledged romantic relationship between an adult male (the ''erastes'') and a younger male (the ''eromenos'') usually in his teens.&lt;ref&gt;C.D.C. Reeve, ''Plato on Love:'' Lysis, Symposium, Phaedrus, Alcibiades ''with Selections from'' Republic'' and'' Laws (Hackett, 2006), p. xxi [https://books.google.com/books?id=E1lQNf2EfEUC&amp;pg=PP25 online]; Martti Nissinen, ''Homoeroticism in the Biblical World: A Historical Perspective'', translated by Kirsi Stjerna (Augsburg Fortress, 1998, 2004), p. 57 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sHSNPG85tUC&amp;pg=PA57 online]; Nigel Blake ''et al.'', ''Education in an Age of Nihilism'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 183 [https://books.google.com/books?id=lgkOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA183 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was characteristic of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical periods]].&lt;ref&gt;Nissinen,  ''Homoeroticism in the Biblical World'', p. 57; William Armstrong Percy III, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," in ''Same–Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West'' (Binghamton: Haworth, 2005), p. 17. Sexual variety, not excluding ''paiderastia'', was characteristic of the [[Hellenistic era]]; see [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]], "Sex and Classical Literature," in ''Classical Bearings: Interpreting Ancient Culture and History'' (University of California Press, 1989, 1998), p. 146 [https://books.google.com/books?id=zlFXc9N19yUC&amp;pg=PA146 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of pederasty on Greek culture of these periods was so pervasive that it has been called "the principal cultural model for free relationships between citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, ''Cities of the Gods'', p. 193. See also George Boys-Stones, "Eros in Government: Zeno and the Virtuous City," ''Classical Quarterly'' 48 (1998), 168–174: "there is a certain kind of sexual relationship which was considered by many Greeks to be very important for the cohesion of the city: sexual relations between men and youths. Such relationships were taken to play such an important role in fostering cohesion where it mattered — among the male population — that [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]] even gave them official recognition in his constitution for Sparta" (p. 169).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars locate its origin in [[initiation ritual]], particularly rites of passage on [[Crete]], where it was associated with entrance into military life and the religion of [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Koehl, "The Chieftain Cup and a Minoan Rite of Passage," ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 106 (1986) 99–110, with a survey of the relevant scholarship including that of [[Arthur Evans]] (p. 100) and others such as H. Jeanmaire and R.F. Willetts (pp. 104–105); Deborah Kamen, "The Life Cycle in Archaic Greece," in The Cambridge Companion to Archaic Greece (Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 91–92. [[Kenneth Dover]], a pioneer in the study of Greek homosexuality, rejects the initiation theory of origin; see  "Greek Homosexuality and Initiation," in ''Que(e)rying Religion: A Critical Anthology'' (Continuum, 1997), pp. 19–38. For Dover, it seems, the argument that Greek ''paiderastia'' as a social custom was related to rites of passage constitutes a denial of homosexuality as natural or innate; this may be to overstate or misrepresent what the initiatory theorists have said. The initiatory theory claims to account not for the existence of ancient Greek homosexuality in general but rather for that of formal ''paiderastia''.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has no formal existence in the [[Homeric epics]], and seems to have developed in the late 7th century BC as an aspect of Greek [[homosociality|homosocial culture]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hubbard, "Pindar's ''Tenth Olympian'' and Athlete-Trainer Pederasty," in ''Same–Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity'', pp. 143 and 163 (note 37), with cautions about the term "homosocial" from Percy, p. 49, note 5.&lt;/ref&gt; which was characterized also by [[Nudity in sport|athletic]] and [[Depictions of nudity|artistic nudity]], delayed marriage for aristocrats, [[symposium|symposia]], and the social seclusion of women.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," p. 17 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ejPZu3Ktu5cC&amp;pg=PA17 online] ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Pederasty was both idealized and criticized in [[ancient Greek literature|ancient literature]] and [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]].&lt;!--this is a point too fundamental to cite fully here; it will be discussed at length in a section--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see Kenneth Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 165, note 18, where the eschatological value of ''paiderastia'' for the soul in Plato is noted.  For a more cynical view of the custom, see the comedies of Aristophanes, e.g. ''Wealth'' 149-59. Paul Gilabert Barberà, "John Addington Symonds. ''A Problem in Greek Ethics''. Plutarch's ''Eroticus'' Quoted Only in Some Footnotes? Why?" in ''The Statesman in Plutarch's Works'' (Brill, 2004), p. 303 [https://books.google.com/books?id=cruTUAFuWWMC&amp;pg=PA303 online]; and the pioneering view of [[Havelock Ellis]], ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'' (Philadelphia: F.A. Davis, 1921, 3rd ed.), vol. 2, p. 12 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-tgTAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12 online.] For [[Stoicism|Stoic]] "utopian" views of ''paiderastia'', see Doyne Dawson, ''Cities of the Gods: Communist Utopias in Greek Thought'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 192 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HwsWp43OWjsC&amp;pg=PA192 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument has recently been made that idealization was universal in the Archaic period; criticism began in Athens as part of the general Classical Athenian reassessment of Archaic culture.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Andrew Lear]], 'Was pederasty problematized?

Scholars have debated the role or extent of pederasty, which is likely to have varied according to local custom and individual inclination.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lambert, "Athens," in ''Gay Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word "[[pederasty]]" in present-day usage might imply the [[Laws regarding child sexual abuse|abuse]] of [[minor (law)|minors]] in certain jurisdictions, but [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] law, for instance, recognized [[Consent (criminal law)|consent]] but not [[Age of consent|age]] as a factor in regulating sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;See Osborne following. Gloria Ferrari, however, notes that there were conventions of age pertaining to sexual activity, and if a man violated these by seducing a boy who was too young to consent to becoming an ''eromenos'', the [[sexual predator|predator]] might be subject to prosecution under the law of ''[[hubris]]''; ''Figures of Speech: Men and Maidens in Ancient Greece'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002), pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Kouros anavissos.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Kouros]]'' representing an idealized youth, c.&amp;nbsp;530 BC]]The Greek word ''paiderastia'' ({{lang|grc|παιδεραστία}}) is an [[abstract noun]]. It is formed from ''paiderastês'', which in turn is a compound of ''pais'' ("child", plural ''paides'') and ''erastês'' (see below).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pederasty Etymologies] in ''American Heritage Dictionary'', ''Random House Dictionary'', and ''Online Etymology Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; Although the word ''pais'' can refer to a child of either sex, ''paiderastia'' is defined by [[Henry Liddell|Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott]]'s [[A Greek-English Lexicon|''Greek-English Lexicon'']] as "the love of boys", and the verb ''paiderasteuein'' as "to be a lover of boys".&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Liddell|Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]], ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940 9th ed., with 1968 supplement in 1985 reprinting), p. 1286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publication of [[Kenneth Dover]]'s work ''[[Greek Homosexuality (book)|Greek Homosexuality]]'', the terms ''erastês'' and ''erômenos'' have been standard for the two pederastic roles.&lt;ref&gt;The pair of terms are used both within and outside the field of classical studies. For surveys and reference works within the study of ancient culture and history, see for instance ''The World of Athens: An Introduction to Classical Athenian Culture'', a publication of the Joint Association of Classical Teachers (Cambridge University Press, 1984, 2003), pp. 149–150 [https://books.google.com/books?id=VgDKeqi4or8C&amp;pg=PA149 online]; John Grimes Younger, ''Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z'' pp. 91–92 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IEqPs2Toy7YC&amp;pg=PA92 online.] Outside classical studies, see for instance Michael Burger, ''The Shaping of Western Civilization: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment'' (University of Toronto Press, 2008), pp. 50–51 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MQUs2QnC2F4C&amp;pg=PA50 online]; Richard C. Friedman and Jennifer I. Downey, ''Sexual Orientation and Psychoanalysis: Sexual Science and Clinical Practice'' (Columbia University Press, 2002), pp. 168–169 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mwtokhymV_4C&amp;pg=PA168 online]; Michael R. Kauth, ''True Nature: A Theory of Sexual Attraction'' (Springer, 2000), p. 87 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PzDKr-qCdTAC&amp;pg=PA87 online]; Roberto Haran, ''Lacan's Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (2004), p. 165ff. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOl1hki9tSMC&amp;pg=PA165 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Both words derive from the Greek verb ''erô'', ''erân'', "to love"; see also [[eros]]. In Dover's strict dichotomy, the ''erastês'' ({{lang|grc|ἐραστής}}, plural ''erastai'') is the older lover, seen as the active or dominant partner,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[suffix]] ''-tês'' (-{{lang|grc|τής}}) denoting [[Agent (grammar)|agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Weir Smyth, "Formation of Substantives," sections 838–839, ''Greek Grammar'' (Harvard University Press, 1920, 1984), pp. 229–230. The insertion of the [[sigma]] between verb stem and suffix is [[Phonaesthetics|euphonic]] (§836).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Erastês'' should be distinguished from Greek ''paiderastês'', which meant "lover of boys" usually with a negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, ''Greek-English Lexicon'', p. 1286.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''erastês'' himself might only be in his early twenties,&lt;ref&gt;William Armstrong Percy III, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'' (University of Illinois Press, 1996), p. 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=TCvoj1efp8UC&amp;pg=PA1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the age difference between the two lovers might be negligible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum]], "Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies," ''Sex and Social Justice'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 309: "because the popular thought of our day tends to focus on the scare image of a 'dirty old man' hanging around outside the school waiting to molest young boys, it is important to mention, as well, that the ''erastês'' might not be very far in age from the ''erômenos''."&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''erômenos'', or "beloved"  (ἐρώμενος, plural ''eromenoi''), is the [[grammatical gender|masculine]] form of the [[Ancient Greek grammar#Participle|present passive participle]] from ''erô'', viewed by Dover as the passive or subordinate partner. An ''erômenos'' can also be called ''pais'', "child".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''pais'' was regarded as a future citizen, not an "inferior object of sexual gratification", and was portrayed with respect in art.&lt;ref&gt;Marguerite Johnson and Terry Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Literature: A Sourcebook'' (Routledge, 2005), p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HhjWNd2R1F8C&amp;pg=PA4 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The word can be understood as an endearment such as a parent might use, found also in the poetry of [[Sappho]]&lt;ref&gt;It is uncertain whether the ''pais'' Kleis is Sappho's actual daughter, or whether the word is affectionate. Anne L. Klinck, "'Sleeping in the Bosom of a Tender Companion': Homoerotic Attachments in Sappho," in ''Same-sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West'' (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 202 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ejPZu3Ktu5cC&amp;pg=PA202 online]; Jane McIntosh Snyder, ''The Woman and the Lyre'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), p. 3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=X4CLx2PMk4wC&amp;pg=PA3 online.] The word ''pais'' can also be used of a bride; see Johnson and Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society'', p. 80, note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and a designation of only relative age. Both art and other literary references show that the ''erômenos'' was at least a teen, with modern age estimates ranging from 13 to 20, or in some cases up to 30. Most evidence indicates that to be an eligible ''erômenos'', a youth would be of an age when an aristocrat began his formal military training,&lt;ref&gt;"We can conclude that the ''erômenos'' is generally old enough for mature military and political action": Nussbaum, "Platonic Love and Colorado Law," p. 309 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7zoaKIolT9oC&amp;pg=PA309 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, from fifteen to seventeen.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Mark Golden, endnote to "Slavery and Homosexuality at Athens: Age Differences between ''erastai'' and ''eromenoi''," in ''Homosexuality in the Ancient World'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1992) pp. 175–176 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JrpU6O3VnawC&amp;pg=PA175 online]; also Johnson and Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Culture'', p. 3; Barry S. Strauss, ''Fathers and Sons in Athens: Ideology and Society in the Era of the Peloponnesian War'' (Routledge, 1993), p. 30 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pYcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA30 online]; Martha Nussbaum, "Eros and the Wise: The Stoic Response to a Cultural Dilemma," ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' 13 (1995, 2001), p. 230 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OHcl0NCon7EC&amp;pg=PA260 online.] Nuances of age also discussed by Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', pp. 131–132 [https://books.google.com/books?id=adP_n7PziZIC&amp;pg=PA131 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; As an indication of physical maturity, the ''erômenos'' was sometimes as tall as or taller than the older ''erastês'', and may have his first facial hair.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', pp. 16 and 85; Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Another word used by the Greeks for the younger partner was ''paidika'', a [[grammatical gender|neuter]] plural [[adjective]] ("things having to do with children") treated [[syntax|syntactically]] as masculine singular.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

In poetry and philosophical literature, the ''erômenos'' is often an embodiment of idealized youth; a related ideal depiction of youth in Archaic culture was the ''[[kouros]]'', the long-haired male statuary [[art nude|nude]].&lt;ref&gt;Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', p. 61, considers the ''kouroi'' to be examples of pederastic art. "The particular attributes that ''kouroi'' display match those of such 'beloveds' in the visual and literary sources from the late archaic to the classical age": Deborah Tam Steiner, ''Images in Mind: Statues in Archaic and Classical Greek Literature and Thought'' (Princeton University Press, 2001), p. 215 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zah23ru6oCMC&amp;pg=PA218 online.] The presence of facial and pubic hair on some ''kouroi'' disassociates them with the ''erômenos'' if the latter is taken only as a boy who has not entered adolescence; thus Jeffrey M. Hurwit, "The Human Figure in Early Greek Sculpture and Vase-Painting," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Archaic Greece'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 275 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6LUcuGdJF30C&amp;pg=PA275 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Fragility of Goodness'', [[Martha Nussbaum]], following Dover, defines the ideal ''erômenos'' as

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a beautiful creature without pressing needs of his own. He is aware of his attractiveness, but self-absorbed in his relationship with those who desire him. He will smile sweetly at the admiring lover; he will show appreciation for the other's friendship, advice, and assistance. He will allow the lover to greet him by touching, affectionately, his genitals and his face, while he looks, himself, demurely at the ground. … The inner experience of an ''erômenos'' would be characterized, we may imagine, by a feeling of proud self-sufficiency. Though the object of importunate solicitation, he is himself not in need of anything beyond himself. He is unwilling to let himself be explored by the other's needy curiosity, and he has, himself, little curiosity about the other. He is something like a god, or the statue of a god.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum]], ''The Fragility of Goodness: (Cambridge University Press, 1986, 2001), p. 188 [https://books.google.com/books?id=GCKqZkyzFO0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA188 online.]''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dover insisted that the active role of the ''erastês'' and the passivity of the ''erômenos'' is a distinction "of the highest importance",&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; but subsequent scholars have tried to present a more varied picture of the behaviors and values associated with ''paiderastia''. Although ancient Greek writers use ''erastês'' and ''erômenos'' in a pederastic context, the words are not technical terms for social roles, and can refer to the "lover" and "beloved" in other hetero- and homosexual couples.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, "Greek Homosexuality and Initiation," pp. 19–20, notes the usage of "the same words for homosexual as for heterosexual emotion … and the same for its physical consummation" from the archaic period on.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{See also|Cretan pederasty}}
The Greek practice of pederasty came suddenly into prominence at the end of the Archaic period of Greek history; there is a brass plaque from Crete, about 650-625 BC, which is the oldest surviving representation of pederastic custom. Such representations appear from all over Greece in the next century; literary sources show it as being established custom in many cities by the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, pp. 205-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Cretan pederasty as a social institution seems to have been grounded in an initiation which involved [[Bride kidnapping|abduction]]. A man ({{lang-grc|φιλήτωρ}} – ''philetor'', "lover") selected a youth, enlisted the chosen one's friends to help him, and carried off the object of his affections to his ''andreion'', a sort of men's club or meeting hall. The youth received gifts, and the ''philetor'' along with the friends went away with him for two months into the countryside, where they hunted and feasted. At the end of this time, the ''philetor'' presented the youth with three contractually required gifts: military attire, an ox, and a drinking cup. Other costly gifts followed. Upon their return to the city, the youth sacrificed the ox to Zeus, and his friends joined him at the feast. He received special clothing that in adult life marked him as ''kleinos'', "famous, renowned". The initiate was called a ''parastatheis'', "he who stands beside", perhaps because, like [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] the cup-bearer of Zeus, he stood at the side of the ''philetor'' during meals in the ''andreion'' and served him from the cup that had been ceremonially presented. In this interpretation, the formal custom reflects [[myth and ritual]].&lt;ref&gt;The main source for this rite of initiation is [[Strabo]] 10.483–484, quoting [[Ephoros]]; the summary given here is the construction of Robert B. Koehl, "The Chieftain Cup and a Minoan Rite of Passage," ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 106 (1986), pp. 105–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social aspects==
[[File:Kiss Briseis Painter Louvre G278 full.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Attic [[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] depicting a lover and a beloved kissing (5th century BC)]]

The erastes-eromenos relationship played a role in the Classical Greek social and educational system, had its own complex social-sexual etiquette and was an important social institution among the upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;John Pollini, "The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver," ''Art Bulletin'' 81.1 (1999) 21–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Pederasty has been understood as educative,&lt;ref&gt;Blake ''et al.'', ''Education in an Age of Nihilism'', p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; and Greek authors from [[Aristophanes]] to [[Pindar]] felt it naturally present in the context of aristocratic education (''[[paideia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Nagy]], "Early Greek Views of Poets and Poetry," in ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticis: Classical Criticism'' (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 1997), p. 40 [https://books.google.com/books?id=qNCDdy6fD18C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=paiderastia&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=40#v=onepage&amp;q=paiderastia&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, pederasty as described in the Greek literary sources is an institution reserved for free citizens, perhaps to be regarded as a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] mentorship: "pederasty was widely accepted in Greece as part of a male's coming-of-age, even if its function is still widely debated."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Sarah Iles. ''Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2004. pg. 446; see also Cocca, Carolyn. ''Adolescent Sexuality: A Historical Handbook and Guide''. Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 2006. pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In Crete, in order for the suitor to carry out the ritual abduction, the father had to approve him as worthy of the honor. Among the Athenians, as [[Socrates]] claims in [[Xenophon]]'s ''Symposium,'' "Nothing [of what concerns the boy] is kept hidden from the father, by an ideal&lt;ref&gt;The term here rendered as "ideal" is καλοκἀγαθίᾳ, translated as "a perfect man, a man as he should be" in Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon (Oxford, 1968; p.397)&lt;/ref&gt; lover."&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Symposium;'' VIII.11&lt;/ref&gt; In order to protect their sons from inappropriate attempts at seduction, fathers appointed slaves called ''[[pedagogue]]s'' to watch over their sons. However, according to Aeschines, Athenian fathers would pray that their sons would be handsome and attractive, with the full knowledge that they would then attract the attention of men and "be the objects of fights because of erotic passions".&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Wohl, ''Love among the Ruins: The Erotics of Democracy in Classical Athens'' p.5 referring to Aeschines, (Tim.134)&lt;/ref&gt;

The age-range when boys entered into such relationships was consonant with that of Greek girls given in marriage, often to adult husbands many years their senior. Boys, however, usually had to be courted and were free to choose their mate, while marriages for girls were arranged for economic and political advantage at the discretion of father and suitor.&lt;ref&gt;A Henri Irénée Marrou, George Lamb, ''History of Education in Antiquity'' p.27&lt;/ref&gt; These connections were also an advantage for a youth and his family, as the relationship with an influential older man resulted in an expanded social network.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Thus, some considered it desirable to have had many admirers or mentors, if not necessarily lovers per se, in one’s younger years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Typically, after their sexual relationship had ended and the young man had married, the older man and his protégé would remain on close terms throughout their life. For those lovers who continued their lovemaking after their beloveds had matured, the Greeks made allowances, saying, "You can lift up a bull, if you carried the calf."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Calimach]], ''Lovers' Legends: The Gay Greek Myths''&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of Greece, pederasty was an acceptable form of homoeroticism that had other, less socially accepted manifestations, such as the sexual use of slaves or being a ''pornos'' ([[prostitution|prostitute]]) or ''hetairos'' (the male equivalent of a [[hetaira]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greek Homosexuality|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674362616|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male prostitution was treated as a perfectly routine matter and visiting prostitutes of either sex was considered completely acceptable for a male citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martha C.

* Becoming one of the nine archons—because the myrtle wreath was worn as sign of the sacred character of that office
* Carrying out a priestly function—because a prostitute was not considered "clean in body"
* Acting as an advocate in the state's interest
* Holding any office whatsoever at any time, in Attica or abroad, whether filled by lot or by election
* Serving as a herald
* Serving as an ambassador
* Addressing the senate or assembly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeschines, Against Timarchus|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D1%3Asection%3D19 |website=Perseus Digital Library|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Aeschines, Against Timarchus 1.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greek Homosexuality"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Dover|title=Greek Homosexuality|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States|isbn=0674362616|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it was believed that since they had sold their own body ''for the pleasure of others'' ({{lang|grc|ἐφ’ ὕβρει}} ''eph’ [[hubris|hybrei]]''), they would not hesitate to sell the interests of the community as a whole.&lt;ref name="Greek Homosexuality" /&gt; If they, or an adult citizen of free status who had prostituted himself, performed any of the official functions prohibited to them by law (in later life), they were liable to prosecution and punishment. However, if they did not perform those specific functions, did not present themselves for the allocation of those functions and declared themselves ineligible if they were somehow mistakenly elected to perform those specific functions, they were safe from prosecution and punishment. As non-citizens visiting or residing in a [[Polis|city-state]] could not perform official functions in any case whatsoever, they could prostitute themselves as much as they wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth J. Dover|title=Greek Homosexuality|date=1989|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674362616|page=29|quote=Since foreigners visiting or residing at Athens had no right in any case to hold office or address the assembly, they were free to prostitute themselves as much as they pleased, without incurring any penalty or any disability greater than that which their status as non-citizens already imposed on them.

===Political expression===
Transgressions of the customs pertaining to the proper expression of homosexuality within the bounds of ''pederaistia'' could be used to damage the reputation of a public figure.  In his speech ''Against Timarchus'' in 346 BC, the Athenian politician [[Aeschines]] argues against further allowing Timarchus, an experienced middle-aged politician, certain political rights as Attic law prohibited anyone who had prostituted himself from exercising those rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth J. Dover|title=Greek Homosexuality|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674362616|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Timarchus was known to have spent his adolescence as the sexual partner of a series of wealthy men in order to obtain money.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschines, Against Timarchus 1.51-52&lt;/ref&gt; Such a law existed because it was believed that anyone who had sold their own body would not hesitate to sell the interests of the city-state.&lt;ref name="Greek Homosexuality" /&gt; Aeschines won his case, and Timarchus was sentenced to ''[[atimia]]'' (disenfranchisement and civic disempowerment). Aeschines acknowledges his own dalliances with beautiful boys, the erotic poems he dedicated to these youths, and the scrapes he has gotten into as a result of his affairs, but emphasizes that none of these were mediated by money. A financial motive thus was viewed as threatening a man's status as free.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

By contrast, as expressed in [[Pausanias of Athens|Pausanias']] speech in Plato's ''Symposium,'' pederastic love was said to be favorable to [[democracy]] and feared by tyrants, because the bond between the ''erastes'' and ''eromenos'' was stronger than that of obedience to a despotic ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Hindley, "Debate: Law, Society and Homosexuality in Classical Athens" in ''Past and Present,'' 133 (1991), p. 167n4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Symposium'' 182c.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athenaeus]] states that "Hieronymus the Aristotelian says that love with boys was fashionable because several tyrannies had been overturned by young men in their prime, joined together as comrades in mutual sympathy." He gives as examples of such pederastic couples the Athenians [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton]], who were credited (perhaps symbolically) with the overthrow of the tyrant [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]] and the establishment of the democracy, and also Chariton and Melanippus.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophists,'' 602&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Aristotle, claimed that the Cretan lawgivers encouraged pederasty as a means of [[population control]], by directing love and sexual desire into non-procreative channels:

&lt;blockquote&gt;and the lawgiver has devised many wise measures to secure the benefit of moderation at table, and the segregation of the women in order that they may not bear many children, for which purpose he instituted association with the male sex.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'' 2.1272a 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Philosophical expression===
&lt;!--clearer outline of different philosophical positions needed; where are the Stoics, for instance?--&gt;
Socrates' love of [[Alcibiades]], which was more than reciprocated, is held as an example of chaste pederasty.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Socrates remarks in the dialogue Phaedrus that sexual pederasty is driven by the appetital part of the soul, but can be balanced by self-control and reason. He likens wanton lust for a boy to allowing a disobedient horse to control a chariot, but remarks that sexual desire for a boy if combined with a love for their other qualities is acceptable.

[[Phaedrus (Athenian)|Phaedrus]] in Plato's Symposium remarks:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For I know not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning in life than a virtuous lover, or to a lover than a beloved youth. For the principle, I say, neither kindred, nor honor, nor wealth, nor any motive is able to implant so well as love. Of what am I speaking? Of the sense of honor and dishonor, without which neither states nor individuals ever do any good or great work… And if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their loves, they would be the very best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonor and emulating one another in honor; and it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that when fighting at each other’s side, although a mere handful, they would overcome the world.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Phaedrus in the ''Symposium''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Laws, Plato takes a much more austere stance to homosexuality than in previous works, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... one certainly should not fail to observe that when male unites with female for procreation the pleasure experienced is held to be due to nature, but contrary to nature when male mates with male or female with female, and that those first guilty of such enormities [the Cretans] were impelled by their slavery to pleasure. And we all accuse the Cretans of concocting the story about Ganymede. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plato states here that "we all", possibly referring to society as a whole or simply his social group, believe the story of Ganymede's homosexuality to have been fabricated by the Cretans to justify immoral behaviours. 

The Athenian stranger in Plato's ''Laws'' blames pederasty for promoting civil strife and driving many to their wits' end, and recommends the prohibition of [[sexual intercourse]] with youths, laying out a path whereby this may be accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Laws'', 636d and 835e&lt;/ref&gt;

===In myth and religion===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Religion and sexuality]]--&gt;&lt;!--For instance, if there's any basis to treating Narcissus as a pederastic myth, that should be moved here--&gt;

The [[Greek mythology|myth]] of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]'s abduction by [[Zeus]] was invoked as a precedent for the pederastic relationship, as Theognis asserts to a friend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is some pleasure in loving a boy ''(paidophilein)'', since once in fact even the son of [[Cronus]] ''(that is, Zeus)'', king of immortals, fell in love with Ganymede, seized him, carried him off to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], and made him divine, keeping the lovely bloom of boyhood ''(paideia)''. So, don't be astonished, Simonides, that I too have been revealed as captivated by love for a handsome boy.&lt;ref&gt;Theognidean corpus 1345–50, as cited by Kamen, "The Life Cycle in Archaic Greece," p. 91. Although the speaker is identified here conventionally as Theognis, certain portions of the work attributed to him may not be by the Megaran poet.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The myth of Ganymede's abduction, however, was not taken seriously by some in Athenian society, and deemed to be a Cretan fabrication designed to justify their homoeroticism.&lt;ref&gt; Plato's Laws, 636c &lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar Joseph Pequigney states:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Neither Homer nor Hesiod ever explicitly ascribes homosexual experiences to the gods or to heroes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 5th century BC poet [[Pindar]] constructed the story of a sexual pederastic relationship between [[Poseidon]] and [[Pelops]], this was intended to replace an earlier story of cannibalism that Pindar deemed an unsavoury representation of the Gods.&lt;ref&gt; Joseph Pequigney, Homosexuality in ancient Greek myth &lt;/ref&gt; The story tells of Poseidon's love for a mortal boy, Pelops, who wins a chariot race with help from his admirer Poseidon. 

Though examples of such a custom exist in earlier Greek works, myths providing examples of young men who were the lovers of gods began to emerge in classical literature, around the 6th century BC. In these later tales, pederastic love is ascribed to [[Zeus]] (with [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]), [[Poseidon]] (with [[Pelops]]), [[Apollo]] (with Cyparissus, Hyacinthus and Adnetus), [[Orpheus]], [[Heracles]], [[Dionysus]], [[Hermes]], and [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].  All the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] except [[Ares]] are purported to have had these relationships, which some scholars argue demonstrates that the specific customs of ''paiderastia'' originated in initiatory rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Sergent, ''Homosexuality and Greek Myth,'' ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Mythology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/classical_myth.html |title=Classical Mythology |publisher=[[glbtq.com]] |accessdate=February 5, 2015 |last=Pequigney |first=Joseph |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129042407/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/classical_myth.html |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myths attributed to the homosexuality of [[Dionysus]] are very late and often post-pagan additions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ampelos]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}} The tale of Dionyssus and [[Ampelos]] was written by the Egyptian poet [[Nonnus]] some time between the 4th and 5th centuries AD, making it unreliable. Likewise, the tale of Dionysus and [[Polymnus]], which tells that the former anally masturbated with a fig branch over the latter's grave, was written by Christians, whose aim was to discredit pagan mythology.&lt;ref&gt; Hyginus, Astronomy 2.5; Clement of Alexandria, Protreptikos 2.34.2-5; Arnobius, Against the Gentiles 5.28 (Dalby 2005, pp. 108–117) &lt;/ref&gt;

Dover, however, believed that these myths are only literary versions expressing or explaining the "overt" homosexuality of Greek archaic culture, the distinctiveness of which he contrasted to attitudes in other ancient societies such as Egypt and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, "Greek Homosexuality and Initiation,"''passim'', especially pp. 19–20, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greek pottery|Greek vase painting]] is a major source for scholars seeking to understand attitudes and practices associated with ''paiderastia''.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent collation of evidence from vase-painting and an introduction to its interpretation, see [[Andrew Lear]], and [[Eva Cantarella]], ''Images of Ancient Greek Pederasty: Boys Were Their Gods'' (Routledge, 2008). {{ISBN|978-0-415-22367-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of pederastic scenes are depicted on [[Black-figure pottery#Attica|Attic black-figure vases]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Kamen, "The Life Cycle in Archaic Greece," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Archaic Greece'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 91 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6LUcuGdJF30C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=%22hundreds+of+representations+of+pederastic+relationships%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hundreds%20of%20representations%20of%20pederastic%20relationships%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, [[John Beazley]] classified pederastic vases into three types:
* The ''erastês'' and ''erômenos'' stand facing each other; the ''erastês'', knees bent, reaches with one hand for the beloved's chin and with the other for his genitals.
* The ''erastês'' presents the ''erômenos'' with a small gift, sometimes an animal.
* The standing lovers engage in [[intercrural sex]].&lt;ref&gt;Beazley as summarized by Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain gifts traditionally given by the ''eromenos'' become symbols that contribute to interpreting a given scene as pederastic. Animal gifts—most commonly hares and roosters, but also deer and felines—point toward hunting as an aristocratic pastime and as a metaphor for sexual pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Judith M. Barringer, ''The Hunt in Ancient Greece'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), pp. 70–72 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PMqCYtXqub4C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22Attic+vase+painting+scenes+of+pederastic+courtship%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Attic%20vase%20painting%20scenes%20of%20pederastic%20courtship%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit nature of some images has led in particular to discussions of whether the ''eromenos'' took active pleasure in the sex act. The youthful beloved is never pictured with an erection; his penis "remains flaccid even in circumstances to which one would expect the penis of any healthy adolescent to respond willy-nilly".&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, ''The Fragility of Goodness'', p. 188; see also Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', p. 96; Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Fondling the youth's genitals was one of the most common images of pederastic courtship on vases, a gesture indicated also in Aristophanes' comedy ''[[The Birds (play)|Birds]]'' (line 142). Some vases do show the younger partner as sexually responsive, prompting one scholar to wonder, "What can the point of this act have been unless lovers in fact derived some pleasure from feeling and watching the boy's developing organ wake up and respond to their manual stimulation?"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hubbard, review of David Halperin's ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality'' (2002), ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 22 September 2003 [http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2003/2003-09-22.html online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronological study of the vase paintings also reveals a changing aesthetic in the depiction of the ''erômenos''. In the 6th century BC, he is a young beardless man with long hair, of adult height and physique, usually nude. As the 5th century begins, he has become smaller and slighter, "barely pubescent", and often draped as a girl would be. No inferences about social customs should be based on this element of the courtship scene alone.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 140; Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poetry====
There are many pederastic references among the works of the [[Megara]]n poet [[Theognis]] addressed to Cyrnus (Greek ''Kyrnos'').  Some portions of the Theognidean corpus are probably not by the individual from Megara, but rather represent "several generations of [[wisdom poetry]]".  The poems are "social, political, or ethical precepts transmitted to Cyrnus as part of his formation into an adult Megarian aristocrat in Theognis' own image".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, ''Homosexuality in Greece and Rome:''
a sourcebook of basic documents in translation,'' University of California, 2003; p.23''&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Theognis and Kyrnos eludes categorization. Although it was assumed in antiquity that Kyrnos was the poet's ''eromenos'', the poems that are most explicitly erotic are not addressed to him; the poetry&lt;ref&gt;Theognis, 2.1353–56.&lt;/ref&gt; on "the joys and sorrows" of pederasty seem more apt for sharing with a fellow ''erastes'', perhaps in the setting of the symposium: "the relationship, in any case, is left vague."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lamberton, ''Hesiod'' (Yale University Press, 1988), p. 26 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BL2AZpopNu8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA26&amp;dq=Theognis+Kyrnos&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=Theognis%20Kyrnos&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, Theognis (and the tradition that appears under his name) treats the pederastic relationship as heavily pedagogical.&lt;ref&gt;On the contrast between the Theognidean and Anacreontic visions of pederasty, see [[Andrew Lear]] 'Ancient Pederasty:  an introduction' in ''A Companion to Greek and Roman Sexualities'', ed. Thomas K. Hubbard (Wiley Blackwell, 2014), pp. 104-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The poetic traditions of Ionia and Aeolia featured poets such as [[Anacreon]], [[Mimnermus]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], who composed many of the sympotic [[skolia]] that were to become later part of the mainland tradition. [[Ibycus]] came from [[Rhegium]] in the Greek west and entertained the court of [[Polycrates]] in Samos with pederastic verses.  By contrast with Theognis, these poets portray a version of pederasty that is non-pedagogical, focused exclusively on love and seduction. [[Theocritus]], a Hellenistic poet, describes a kissing contest for youths that took place at the tomb of a certain Diocles, renowned for friendship; he notes that invoking [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] was proper to the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Theocritus, Idyll XII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beazley, "Some Attic Vases in the Cyprus Museum", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' 33 (1947); p.199; Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality'', pp. 94-96.&lt;/ref&gt; (Athenian amphora, 5th century BCE)]]

==Sexual practices==
Vase paintings and references to the eromenos's thighs in poetry&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see Johnson and Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society'', p. 116, note 4, quoting a fragment from [[Solon]]: "a man falls in love with a youth in the full-flower of boy-love / possessed of desire-enhancing thighs and a honey-sweet mouth"; Nussbaum, ''Sex and Social Justice'', p. 450, note 48, quoting a fragment of the lost ''Myrmidons'' of [[Aeschylus]] in which [[Achilles]] mourns the dead [[Patroclus]], their "many kisses", and the "god-fearing converse with your thighs".&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that when the pederastic couple engaged in sex acts, the preferred form was [[intercrural sex|intercrural]].&lt;ref&gt;Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece'', p. 119; Nussbaum, ''Sex and Social Justice'', pp. 268, 307, 335; Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; To preserve his dignity and honor, the ''erômenos'' limits the man who desires him to penetration between closed thighs.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no known visual depictions of [[Anal sex]] between pederastic couples, though this does not prove the behavior did not occur. Some vase paintings, which Percy considers a fourth type of pederastic scene in addition to Beazley's three, show the ''erastês'' seated with an erection and the ''erômenos'' either approaching or climbing into his lap. The composition of these scenes is the same as that for depictions of women mounting men who are seated and aroused for intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Ancient Greece,'' p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; As a cultural norm considered apart from personal preference, anal penetration was most often seen as dishonorable to the one penetrated, or shameful,&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, ''Sex and Social Justice'', pp. 268, 335; Ferrari, ''Figures of Speech'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; because of "its potential appearance of being turned into a woman" and because it was feared that it may distract the ''erômenos'' from playing the active, penetrative role later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|title=Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=1994|volume=80|issue=7|pages=1547, 1550|jstor=1073514|quote=* Where relations between two male citizens are concerned, we again find no general condemnation, but instead a complex system of caveats or reservations. We must begin by noting that these relations, even when they involve people close to one another in age, always involve an asymmetry of roles: the erastes or "lover" is the older partner, who actively pursues and courts the younger, drawn by the sight of youthful male beauty. The eraste's is expected to be keenly interested in sexual contact; this interest, and the active, penetrative conduct that follows from it, is taken to be perfectly normal and natural. The younger partner, the eromenos or "beloved", is likely to be pleased at being the object of admiration and interested in benefits such as friendship, education, and political advancement that a relationship with an erastes may bestow. The relationship may in this sense involve a real reciprocity of benefits and mutual affection based on it. But the cultural norm dictates that the eromenos is not to have a keen sexual interest in being penetrated, nor to develop habits of enjoying that sort of penetration; for that would be, in effect, to be turned into a woman, and one could expect that this would make him unfit to play, later in life, an active manly role. * The important point to stress, in any case, is that the shame potentially at issue was not about the fact of same-sex copulation, but about the "womanish" position of passivity and its potential appearance of being turned into a woman. No such shame, it would seem, attached even potentially to conduct that did not involve anal penetration, thus not to conduct involving intercrural intercourse, apparently the most common mode of male-male copulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fable attributed to [[Aesop]] tells how [[Aeschyne]] (Shame) consented to enter the human body from behind only as long as Eros did not follow the same path, and would fly away at once if he did. A man who acted as the receiver during anal intercourse may have been the recipient of the insult "kinaidos", meaning effeminate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aesop]], "Zeus and Shame" (Perry 109, Chambry 118, Gibbs 528), in ''Fables''.&lt;/ref&gt; No shame was associated with intercrural penetration or any other act that did not involve anal penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha C.|title=Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=1994|volume=80|issue=7|pages=1550|jstor=1073514|quote=No such shame, it would seem, attached even potentially to conduct that did not involve anal penetration, thus not to conduct involving intercrural intercourse, apparently the most common mode of male-male copulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral sex is likewise not depicted,{{Request quotation|date=September 2015}} or directly suggested, anal or oral penetration seems to have been reserved for prostitutes or slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Ryan, ''Sexuality in Greek and Roman Society and Literature'', p. 3, based on Attic red-figure pottery; Percy, ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Ancient Greece,'' p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dover maintained that the erômenos was ideally not supposed to feel "unmanly" desire for the erastês.&lt;ref&gt;Dover, ''Greek Homosexuality''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martha Nussbaum|Nussbaum]] argues that the depiction of the erômenos as deriving no sexual pleasure from sex with the erastês "may well be a cultural norm that conceals a more complicated reality", as the erômenos is known to have frequently felt intense affection for his erastês and there is evidence that he experienced sexual arousal with him as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martha C. Nussbaum|title=Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=1994|volume=80|issue=7|pages=1554–1555|jstor=1073514|publisher=Virginia Law Review|quote=We must now also address the issue of mutuality, which Finnis misuses to make the erastes-eromenos relationship look inherently exploitative. It is true that the eromenos is depicted typically as deriving no sexual pleasure from the conduct, although this may well be a cultural norm that conceals a more complicated reality. Dover aptly compares the situation of the eromenos to that of a young woman in Britain in the 1930s (Dover, Greek Homosexuality, supra note 48, at 88). He might have extended the comparison to take in this point: just as a proper Victorian woman was publicly expected not to enjoy sex, but frequently did in private, so too it is possible that the eromenos derived more pleasure than is publicly depicted. In his postscript to the second edition, Dover grants that there is some literary evidence that the erastes stimulated the penis of the eromenos, and that one vase shows an eromenos with an erection. What is more important is that it is perfectly clear that a successful relationship of this sort produced many advantages for the younger man- education, political advancement, friendship and that he frequently felt intense affection for the erastes as a result.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'',  it is related that, with time, the erômenos develops a "passionate longing" for his erastês and a "reciprocal love" (''anteros'') for him that is a replica of the erastês' love. The eromenos is also said to have a desire "similar to the erastes', albeit weaker, to see, to touch, to kiss and to lie with him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martha C. Nussbaum|title=Platonic Love and Colorado Law: The Relevance of Ancient Greek Norms to Modern Sexual Controversies|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=1994|volume=80|issue=7|pages=1572–1573|jstor=1073514|publisher=Virginia Law Review|quote=Nor is passionate arousal a mere stage in the soul's progress: it gives rise to an enduring relationship in which physical infatuation is deepened by conversation and the pursuit of shared spiritual goals and in which the "mad" lover's state gives rise to generous and stable friendship, rather than to the dangers of which "Lysias" warns. Most remarkable of all, it also gives rise to a reciprocation of sexual desire on the part of the younger man who, taking note of the unparalleled generosity of his lover, finds himself suffused with a stream of desire from "the source of that stream that Zeus, in love with Ganymede, called 'passionate longing.'" The younger man conceives a longing and desire for his erastes, "having a 'reciprocal-love' [anteros] that is a replica of the other's love." But he calls it, and thinks that it is, philia rather than eros. He has desire similar to the other's, albeit weaker, to see, to touch, to kiss, to lie with him. Recall that Greek homosexuality involves reciprocity conventionally of a sort, for the eromenos receives kindliness and education in return for his beauty. Here the language indicates the culturally unusual nature of the proposal, for the young man lacks a word for his own desire. Plato, thus, constructs a more thoroughgoing understanding of reciprocity, extending to the body's longing for beauty. The relationship is envisaged as a long-lasting one, in which the erastes and eromenos "associate with touching in the gymnasia and in other places of association". What is at issue is a complicated etymological play on the word himeros, or "passionate longing". Himeros has been etymologized as deriving from "particles" (mere') that "flow" (rhein) from the beloved to the lover. The dialogue is suffused with this sort of word play, much of it erotic. See id.; cf. Plato, Cratylus 419e (using similarly expressive and erotic language).  Such reciprocity was not unknown before this-Socrates describes the experience as one that is likely to follow upon the young man's perception of his lover's generosity-but what is clear is that the cultural vocabulary lacks a description for it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional characteristics==
===The Greek East===
Unlike the Dorians, where a lover would usually have only one eromenos, in the east a man might have several eromenoi over the course of his life. From the poems of Alcaeus we learn that the lover would customarily invite his eromenos to dine with him.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, William A. ''Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece,'' pp146-150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sparta===
[[File:Hyakinthos.jpg|thumb|[[Zephyrus]] and [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinthus]], the latter was a patron hero of pederasty in Greece. Attic red-figure cup from Tarquinia, c.&amp;nbsp;490&amp;nbsp;BC]]
The nature of this relationship is in dispute among ancient sources, and modern historians. 

Spartan views on pederasty and homoeroticism were much more austere than those of other parts of Greece.

[[Xenophon]] says in Constitution of the Lacaedemonians that Spartan customs were unsuited to pederasty: a man might aim for idealized friendship with a boy but a sexual relationship was considered "an abomination" tantamount to incest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''Constitution of the Lacedaemonians'', 2.13: "The customs instituted by Lycurgus were opposed to all of these. If someone, being himself an honest man, admired a boy's soul and tried to make of him an ideal friend without reproach and to associate with him, he approved, and believed in the excellence of this kind of training. But if it was clear that the attraction lay in the boy's outward beauty, he banned the connexion as an abomination; and thus he caused lovers to abstain from boys no less than parents abstain from sexual intercourse with their children and brothers and sisters with each other." [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0210%3Atext%3DConst.+Lac.%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D13 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]'s Historical Miscellany talks about the responsibilities of an older Spartan citizen to younger inexperienced male lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus]] ''Various History'', 3.10: "I could cite many fine features on the [[ephor]]s of Sparta: I chose a few, I'll report. If a young Spartan, beautiful and well made, preferred a rich friend to a poor righteous man, the [[ephor]]s condemned him to a fine; no doubt, that he might be punished by his love for wealth by the loss of part of his. They punished the same every citizen honest man, who was attached by friendship to none of the young people that we knew to be well born: they thought that an honest man would have made his friend, and perhaps some others, in people like him. Indeed, the kindness of those who love, if indeed deserves to be respected, is a powerful stimulus to excite the beloved's virtue. A Spartan law even ordered to pardon a young man, for his youth and inexperience, the mistakes he committed, and to punish in its place the citizen who loved him, to teach him to be the supervisor and judge of the actions of his friend."&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas F. Scanlon believes [[Sparta]], during its [[Dorians|Dorian]] polis time, is thought to be the first city to practice athletic nudity, and one of the first to formalize pederasty.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Scanlon, "The Dispersion of Pederasty and the Athletic Revolution in Sixth-Century BC Greece," in ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition of the West,'' pp. 64-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Megara===
[[Megara]] cultivated good relations with Sparta, and may have been culturally attracted to emulate Spartan practices in the 7th century, when pederasty is postulated to have first been formalized in Dorian cities.&lt;ref&gt;N.G.L. Hammond, ''A history of Greece to 322 BC,'' 1989; p.150&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first cities after Sparta to be associated with the custom of [[athletic nudity]], [[Megara]] was home to the runner [[Orsippus]] who was famed as the first to run the footrace naked at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] and "first of all Greeks to be crowned victor naked".&lt;ref&gt;W. Sweet, ''Sport and Recreation in Ancient Greece,'' 1987; p.125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 1.44.1&lt;/ref&gt; In one poem, the Megaran poet Theognis saw athletic nudity as a prelude to pederasty: "Happy is the lover who works out naked / And then goes home to sleep all day with a beautiful boy."&lt;ref&gt;Theognis, 2.1335–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athens===
{{main article|Athenian pederasty}}
In Athens, as elsewhere, ''pederastia'' appears to have been a characteristic of the aristocracy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[Greek pottery|Attic pottery]] is a major source for modern scholars attempting to understand the institution of pederasty.&lt;ref&gt;Rommel Mendès-Leite et al. ''Gay Studies from the French Cultures'' p.157; Percy, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," pp. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The age of youth depicted has been estimated variously from 12 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, "Reconsiderations about Greek Homosexualities," p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Athenian laws addressed the pederastic relationship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Boeotia===
In [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], the main polis in [[Boeotia]], renowned for its practice of pederasty, the tradition was enshrined in the [[founding myth]] of the city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In this instance the story was meant to teach by counterexample: it depicts [[Laius]], one of the mythical ancestors of the Thebans, in the role of a lover who betrays the father and rapes the son. Another Boeotian pederastic myth is the story of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

According to Plutarch, Theban pederasty was instituted as an educational device for boys in order to "soften, while they were young, their natural fierceness, and to "temper the manners and characters of the youth".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of [[Pelopidas]]''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a tradition, The [[Sacred Band of Thebes]] comprised pederastic couples.&lt;ref&gt;David Leitao, 'The legend of the Theban Band', in M. Craven Nussbaum and J. Sihvola ''The Sleep of Reason'': Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome'', Chicago University Press (2002), pages 140-50''&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeotian pottery, in contrast to that of Athens, does not exhibit the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece#In art|three types of pederastic scenes]] identified by Beazley. The limited survival and cataloguing of pottery that can be proven to have been made in Boeotia diminishes the value of this evidence in distinguishing a specifically local tradition of ''paiderastia''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hupperts, "Boeotian Swine: Homosexuality in Boeotia" in ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity,'' p. 190 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ejPZu3Ktu5cC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=%22we+notice+that+we+do+not+find+on+the+Boeotian+vases%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22we%20notice%20that%20we%20do%20not%20find%20on%20the%20Boeotian%20vases%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern scholarship==
The ethical views held in ancient societies, such as [[Athens]], [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], [[Crete]], [[Sparta]], [[Elis]] and others, on the practice of pederasty have been explored by scholars only since the end of the 19th century. One of the first to do so was [[John Addington Symonds]], who wrote his seminal work ''A Problem in Greek Ethics'' in 1873, but after a private edition of 10 copies (1883) only in 1901 could the work really be published, in revised form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/lgbt/pge/index.htm A Problem in Greek Ethics Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Carpenter]] expanded the scope of the study, with his 1914 work, ''Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk''. The text examines homoerotic practices of all types, not only pederastic ones, and ranges over cultures spanning the whole globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/lgbt/itp/index.htm Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Germany the work was continued by classicist Paul Brandt writing under the pseudonym Hans Licht, who published his ''Sexual Life in Ancient Greece'' in 1932.

Mainstream [[Ancient Greek]] studies however had historically omitted references of the widespread practice of [[homosexuality]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[E. M. Forster]]'s 1914 novel [[Maurice (novel)|''Maurice'']] makes reference to modern European ambivalence toward this aspect of ancient Greek culture in a scene where a [[Cambridge]] professor, leading a group of students in translating an ancient Greek text says, "Omit the reference to the unspeakable vice of the Greeks."   Later in the 1940s H. Mitchell wrote: "This aspect of Greek morals is an extraordinary one, into which, for the sake of our equanimity, it is unprofitable to pry too closely". It would not be until 1978 and [[Kenneth Dover|K. J. Dover]]'s book ''[[Greek Homosexuality (book)|Greek Homosexuality]],'' that the topic would be widely and frankly discussed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Dover's work triggered a number of debates which still continue. Sociologist of the 20th century [[Michel Foucault]] declared that pederasty was "problematized" in Greek culture, that it was "the object of a special—and especially intense—moral preoccupation", which was "subjected to an interplay of positive and negative interplays so complex as to make the ethics that governed it difficult to decipher",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Masterson|author2=Nancy Sorkin Rabinowitz|author3=James Robson|title=Sex in Antiquity: Exploring Gender and Sexuality in the Ancient World|date=5 December 2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317602774 |page=115 |edition=revised |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k1G2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115 |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on concern with the chastity/moderation of the ''erōmenos'' (the term used for the "beloved" youth).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} A modern line of thought leading from Dover to Foucault to Halperin holds that the erōmenos did not reciprocate the love and desire of the erastes, and that the relationship was factored on a sexual domination of the younger by the older, a politics of penetration held to be true of all adult male Athenians' relations with their social inferiors—boys, women and slaves—a theory propounded also by Eva Keuls.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Keuls, ''The Reign of the Phallus: Sexual Politics in Ancient Athens,'' 1985&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, the relationships are characterized and factored on a power differential between the participants, and as essentially asymmetrical.

Other scholars point to artwork on vases, poetry and philosophical works such as the Platonic discussion of [[anteros]], "love returned", all of which show tenderness and desire and love on the part of the eromenos matching and responding to that of the erastes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Critics of Dover and his followers also point out that they ignore all material which argued against their "overly theoretical" interpretation of a human and emotional relationship&lt;ref&gt;James Davidson, ''The Greeks and Greek Love,'' Orion, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and counter that "Clearly, a mutual, consensual bond was formed",&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Koehl, "Ephoros and Ritualized Homosexuality in Bronze Age Crete", in ''Queer Representations: Reading Livers, Reading Cultures;'' Martin Duberman, ed. New York University, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is "a modern fairy tale that the younger eromenos was never aroused".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ho-hz/homosexuality/homosexuality.html Hein van Dolen, ''Greek homosexuality'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Halperin's position has been criticized as a "persistently negative and judgmental rhetoric implying exploitation and domination as the fundamental characteristics of pre-modern sexual models" and challenged as a polemic of "mainstream assimilationist gay apologists" and an attempt to "demonize and purge from the movement" all non-orthodox male sexualities, especially that involving adults and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, "Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2003.09.22" of David M. Halperin's ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality''[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2003/.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

As classical historian [[Robin Osborne]] has pointed out, historical discussion of ''paiderastia'' is complicated by 21st-century moral standards:&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is the historian's job to draw attention to the personal, social, political and indeed moral issues behind the literary and artistic representations of the Greek world. The historian's job is to present pederasty and all, to make sure that … we come face to face with the way [[To Helen#Revised 1845 version|the glory that was Greece]] was part of a world in which many of our own [[value system|core values]] find themselves challenged rather than reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Osborne]], ''Greek History'' (Routledge, 2004), pp. 12 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4baOPEunQgoC&amp;pg=PA12 online] and 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Pressed Steel Car strike of 1909''', also known as the "1909 [[McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania|McKees Rocks]] strike," was an [[United States|American]] [[labour (economics)|labor]] [[strike action|strike]] which lasted from July 13 through September 8. The walkout drew national attention when it climaxed on Sunday August 22 in a bloody battle between strikers, private security agents, and the [[Pennsylvania State Police]]. At least 12 people died, and perhaps as many as 26.&lt;ref&gt;Marylynne Pitz, "Pressed Steel Car strike in McKees Rocks reaches centennial anniversary". ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', August 16, 2009, pg. E1.&lt;/ref&gt; The strike was the major industrial labor dispute in the [[Pittsburgh]] district after the famous 1892 [[Homestead strike]] and was a precursor to the [[Steel Strike of 1919|Great Steel Strike of 1919]].

==History of the strike==

===Background===

Frank Norton Hoffstot's [[Pressed Steel Car Company]], sited downstream from Pittsburgh on the south bank of the [[Ohio River]] in [[McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania]], manufactured passenger and freight railroad cars on an assembly-line basis. It was America's second-largest rail car producer.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Levinson, ''I Break Strikes: The Technique of Pearl L. Bergoff''. New York: Robert M. McBride &amp; Co., 1935; pg. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressed Steel employed a workforce of 6,000, most foreign born, comprising 16 distinct ethnicities. The firm was infamous for its style of industrial peonage with immigrant workers.&lt;ref&gt;Charles McCollester, ''The Point of Pittsburgh: Production and Struggle at the Forks of the Ohio.'' Pittsburgh: Battle of Homestead Foundation, 2008; pg. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working conditions in the plant were primitive even by Pittsburgh standards.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal Eastman, ''Work-Accidents and the Law''. New York: Russell Sage Foundation Publications, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressed Steel Car Company was locally called "The Last Chance" and "The Slaughterhouse". "Men are persecuted, robbed, and slaughtered, and their wives are abused in a manner worse than death&amp;mdash;all to obtain or retain positions that barely keep starvation from the door," said Rev. A.F. Toner, a priest at St. Mary Roman Catholic Church in McKees Rocks, in an interview with ''The [[Pittsburgh Leader]]''. The local coroner, [[Joseph G. Armstrong]], estimated that deaths in the plant averaged about one a day and were often caused by moving cranes. One of the charges made by Slavic immigrant workers was that wives and daughters were subject to sexual harassment to repay food and rental debts to the company agents.&lt;ref&gt;McCollester, ''The Point of Pittsburgh,'' pg. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Strike0816rescan 500.jpg|250px|right|Anti-Hoffstot cartoon about the 1909 strike]]
Particularly galling to the workers was the use of the [[Baldwin contract]], commonly known as "pooling." Under this system, jobs were parceled out in lots by a foreman who contracted that it be done for a given sum, with the money paid to be divided pro rata by the men under him.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Duchez, "The Strikes in Pennsylvania," ''The International Socialist Review,'' vol. 10, no. 3 (September 1909), pg. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was rife with corruption, with workers often paying substantial [[bribery|kickback]]s to the foreman to retain their jobs.&lt;ref name="Strikes195"&gt;Duchez, "The Strikes in Pennsylvania," pg. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The system resulted in unpredictable and often insufficient rates of pay, as one sympathetic journalist reported:

{{quote|President [Frank N.] Hoffstot says that it has proven to be a very satisfactory arrangement. And it has — for the company. As evidence of this we saw several pay envelopes showing that many of the workers slave for practically nothing. One envelope showed that the owner worked nine days, ten hours a day, and got $2.75; another eleven days and received $3.75; another three days and got $1.75; another four days and got $1, and the fifth, who had been idle for two months, worked three days and received nothing.... The company manages the pooling system through the foreman — and the workers are skinned until their bones shine. *  *  * 

Two years ago, before the pooling system was introduced, the men were making $3, $4, and $5 a day. Today most of them make 50 and 75 cents and $1 a day."&lt;ref&gt;Duchez, ''The Strikes in Pennsylvania,'' pp. 194-195.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Adding further to the destabilizing misery was the company-owned housing, ramshackle dwellings housing six families and renting for $12 a month.&lt;ref name="Strikes195" /&gt; Moreover, the company owned the [[company store|stores]] from which the workers had to buy their provisions at inflated prices, lest they lose their jobs.&lt;ref name="Strikes195" /&gt; The system of economic domination was particularly severe and there came a day when the breaking point was reached.

===The strike begins===
[[File:McKees-constables-1909.jpg|thumb|300px|Mounted members of the Pennsylvania constabulary were deployed during the McKees Rocks strike. These officers were called "Cossacks" by the strikers.]]

The strike was triggered on Saturday July 10, a payday on which many workers were shorter in their pay than usual. The men demanded an explanation; management refused to speak with the workers' representatives. James Rider, manager of The Pressed Steel Car Company, responded by hiring [[Pearl Bergoff]], the notorious owner of strike-breaking paramilitary force.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, ''I Break Strikes,'' pg. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first fatality was an immigrant striker named Stephen Horvat, shot and killed by a black strikebreaker called Major Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sherrif Refuses to Evict Strikers|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/08/13/101818901.pdf|accessdate=29 March 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=12 August 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later Berghoff had deployed 500 strikebreakers to the plant, most entering quietly by rail, although a boat called ''Steel Queen'' carrying 300 was rebuffed, at least initially, by strikers' gunfire on the shore.

The next day 200 state constables and 300 deputy sheriffs insured the safety of the strikebreakers and also began evicting strikers from company houses. ''The New York Times'' reported, "The illiterate foreigners were like so many savages today when they first caught sight of the khaki-clad constabulary who had come in during the night."&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, ''I Break Strikes,'' pg. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strikers were joined by members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), especially [[William Trautmann]], one of its founders. Trautmann later published a novel, ''[[Riot (novel)|Riot]]'', about the McKees Rocks strike. After Trautmann's arrest for strike organizing activities, [[Joe Ettor]] replaced him, and IWW leader [[Big Bill Haywood]] also arrived to rally strikers.&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States. Vol. 4: Industrial Workers of the World.'' New York: International Publishers, 1965; pg. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, some 5,000 workers of the Pressed Steel Car Company's plant at McKees Rock went out on strike. These were joined by 3,000 others who worked for the Standard Steel Car Company of [[Butler, Pennsylvania|Butler]] and others in [[New Castle, Pennsylvania|New Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Duchez, "The Strikes in Pennsylvania," 'pp. 194-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

An adjacent company-owned community, Presston (called Schoenville at the time and popularly referred to as "Hunky Town"), was at the heart of the strike. Presston workers were kept in constant debt to the company store and those behind in rent were evicted. On Saturday August 21 Deputy Sheriff Harry Exley assisted in one eviction by placing a baby buggy on top of a wagon laden with a Presston family's possessions. A photographer captured the moment. When it was printed in a Pittsburgh newspaper, the photo whipped up public sympathy for the strikers.

This set up the confrontation of the next day, August 22, "Bloody Sunday".  A crowd of thousands of strikers who'd set up a checkpoint identified Exley, in civilian clothes, and targeted him for retaliation.  In a fury the mob killed him, and clashed with [[Pennsylvania State Police]] mounted on horseback, called "Black Cossacks" by immigrant Slav workers.&lt;ref name="McCollester, p. 184"&gt;McCollester, ''The Point of Pittsburgh,'' pg. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  One local source put the number of dead at sixteen, which includes Exley, two state troopers, and three strikers.  Perhaps ten others were gravely hurt, "while scores were wounded by being shot in the legs, hit by bricks and clubbed into unconsciousness by the constabulary." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Troops Desired at Schoenville|url=http://access.newspaperarchive.com/us/pennsylvania/new-castle/new-castle-news/1909/08-23/page-4?tag=pressed+steel+strike+1909+exley&amp;rtserp=tags/pressed-steel-strike-1909-exley?psb=relavance|accessdate=29 March 2016|publisher=New Castle (PA) Times|date=23 August 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Martial law was declared the next day.

===Settlement of the strike===
The strike was settled on September 8 when Pressed Steel Car agreed to a wage increase, the posting of wage rates, and ending abuses in company housing practices.

===Legacy===

Before the strike was over,&lt;ref name="access.newspaperarchive.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tell Stories of Brutality - Strikebreakers Complain of Bad Treatment at Schoenville|url=http://access.newspaperarchive.com/us/ohio/east-liverpool/east-liverpool-evening-review/1909/08-28/page-7?tag=pressed+steel+strike+1909+killed|accessdate=30 March 2016|agency=Evening Review, East Liverpool, Ohio|date=28 August 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in more detail in 1911, the strikebreakers appeared before federal panels to describe their own living and working conditions after they were brought to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peonage in Western Pennsylvania: Hearings Before the Committee on Labor of the House of Representatives, Sixty-second Congress, First Session, on House Resolution, Issue 90|date=1911|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0hUoAAAAMAAJ&amp;|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Held inside the plant or in boxcars against their will, fleeced, stolen from, physically threatened, and given rotten food, one hearing witness collapsed and was diagnosed with [[ptomaine poisoning]].&lt;ref name="access.newspaperarchive.com"/&gt;  Two hundred of the strikebreakers had responded by banding together in their own improvised union.  They'd quit work and were camping on the nearby banks of the Ohio River in an attempt to collect back wages, naming Chief of Police Farrell of the [[Coal and Iron Police]] and Pearl Bergoff's lieutenant Sam Cohen as those most responsible.  Lawyer for the strikebreakers was the ambitious [[William N. McNair]], who alleged that this treatment amounted to [[peon]]age.  McNair would later serve one chaotic term as [[List of mayors of Pittsburgh|Mayor of Pittsburgh]] in 1934.

On August 22, 2009 the [[Pennsylvania Labor History Society]] and the [[Pennsylvania Historical &amp; Museum Commission]] dedicated a state historical marker there to commemorate the strike's centennial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pitz|first=Marylynne|title=Historical marker commemorates Presston|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sectionfront/life/historical-marker-commemorates-presston-353689/?print=1|accessdate=23 November 2012|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=August 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rationalist humanism''', or '''rational humanism''' or '''rationalistic humanism''',&lt;ref name="Solzhenitsyn1978Address"/&gt; is one of the strands of [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Janaway1999p404"/&gt; It had its roots in [[Renaissance]], as a response to Middle Age religious integralism and obscurantism.&lt;ref name="Solzhenitsyn1978Address"/&gt; Rationalist humanism tradition includes [[Tocqueville]] and [[Montesquieu]], and in the 19th century, [[Élie Halévy]].&lt;ref name="Anderson1997p170"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aron1978"/&gt;

Other strands of the Enlightenment included [[scientific naturalism]].&lt;ref name="Janaway1999p404"/&gt; In the mid 20th century, rational humanism represented also an alternative for those that did not embrace Sartre's [[existentialism]].&lt;ref name="Carruth1993p932"/&gt; In the late 20th century, it has sided against the equiparation of [[human rights]] with rights to other animal species.&lt;ref name="DerridaFontenay"/&gt;

It became the basis for government and social science and could be defined as rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy: the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him. It could also be called anthropocentricity, with man seen as the center of everything that exists. &lt;BR/&gt; The turn introduced by the Renaissance evidently was inevitable historically. The Middle Ages had come to a natural end by exhaustion, becoming an intolerable despotic repression of man's physical nature in favor of the spiritual one. (...) This new way of thinking (...) did not admit the existence of intrinsic evil in man nor did it see any higher task than the attainment of happiness on earth. (...) a total liberation occurred from the moral heritage of Christian centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice. (...) The West ended up by truly enforcing human rights, sometimes even excessively, but man's sense of responsibility to God and society grew dimmer and dimmer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Cazorla was born in 1955 in [[Larache]], then a [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]], where her family had emigrated at the close of the 19th century. Her father was a military officer of high rank. Her older brother, Luis María Cazorla, is also a jurist. She started her career in 1981 at the Fiscalía of [[Girona]]. In 1984, she moved to [[Valladolid]]. In 1985, she joined the Audiencia Territorial de Madrid, followed by the Inspection Office of the Fiscalía General del Estado in 1993, and afterwards, the Secretaría Técnica.

In September 1996, she was appointed public prosecutor of the High Court, where she gained, between other responsibilities, a public indictment against [[Mario Conde]] in the Banesto case.&lt;ref name="PSOE_FICHA"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Soledad Cazorla, primera fiscal delegada contra la Violencia sobre la Mujer|url=http://www.psoe.es/igualdad/news/56943/page/soledad-cazorla-primera-fiscal-delegada-contra-violencia-sobre-mujer.html|date=18 July 2005|accessdate=4 May 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=La fiscalía pide que se aumente la condena a Conde de 10 a 22 años|url=http://cincodias.com/cincodias/2002/05/07/empresas/1020778807_850215.html|publisher=Cinco Días|date=7 May 2002|accessdate=4 May 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, she rose to Public Prosecutor in the Section against Violence towards Woman she had proposed to the fiscal general of the State, [[Cándido Conde-Pumpido]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Real Decreto|url=https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2005/07/16/pdfs/A25447-25447.pdf|publisher=BOE|date=16 July 2005|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2010, she was re-appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Real Decreto 1369/2010|url=http://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2010-16556|publisher=BOE|date=29 October 2010|accessdate=4 May 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section formed part of the Observation Against Gender Violence.&lt;ref name="El_Mundo"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Muere Soledad Cazorla, fiscal de Sala contra la Violencia de Género|url=http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2015/05/04/55476a3aca4741ed698b4571.html|publisher=El Mundo|date=4 May 2015|accessdate=4 May 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Soledad Cazorla Violencia de Genero.ogv|left|thumb|Intervention of Soledad Cazorla on the Integral Law against Gender Violence in Spain. Niger 2008]]
Cazorla participated in international meetings in defence of women's rights (France, United Kingdom, [[Morocco]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], China or [[Niger]]) as a national jurist, collaborating in publications and articles concerning different matters related with Penal Laws.&lt;ref name="ABOGACIA_SP" /&gt;

As a defender of equality, and with a high personal commitment and professional interest in the fight against gender violence, her professional career was closely linked to the development of this law in Spain, especially, in the need to protect children who coexist with the hard reality of violence against mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Soledad Cazorla – Fondo de Becas Fiscal Soledad Cazorla Prieto|url=http://www.fundacionmujeres.es/becassoledadcazorla/soledad-cazorla/|work=fundacionmujeres.es|accessdate=19 February 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cazorla was married to the journalist Joaquín Tagar and had 3 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=El PSOE destaca la "infalible labor" de Soledad Cazorla para acabar con la violencia contra la mujer|url=http://www.teinteresa.es/espana/PSOE-infalible-Soledad-Cazorla-violencia_0_1351066352.html|publisher=Europa Press|accessdate=4 May 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died of stroke in Madrid on 4 May 2015 .

'''''The Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and The Will of the People''''' is a book on the power of [[nonviolence]] by [[Jonathan Schell]] published in 2003.

Schell starts by discussing the cultural embeddedness of men, patriotism and death in battle (going back to the Athenian - [[Pericles]]). From this classic root political morality has held onto the need for 'standing up for principles with force', which in practice quickly descends to "plunder, exploitation and massacre".

In the 5th century, [[St. Augustine]] conjoined this with Christian love... by theorising 'separate realms' for political and religious morality. Politics has thus long been wedded to violence... it is hard to conceptualise a political ideology that does not have a resort to violence clause. As Schell says there has been, "an age old reliance of politics on violent means". (p.&amp;nbsp;4)

Schell then puts forward his main thesis that "violence has now become dysfunctional as a political instrument" (p.&amp;nbsp;7) and that "forms of non-violent action can serve effectively in the place of violence at every level of political affairs". (p.&amp;nbsp;8)

The key political progress has been the idea of democracy - even the worst democracy - carries within it the principle of equality which is a deeply seated contradiction to an also deeply embedded practice of inequality - see [[Tocqueville]]. Ironically modern national democracy allowed for a new kind of army, in which it was possible to mobilise masses of men prepared to die - apparently in defence of their own national interest and the principle of democracy. The disaster of the modern war system was fed by an unholy confluence of democracy, science, industrial revolution, and [[imperialism]] which developed through the 19th century.

==Power==

Power came to be widely defined by the ability to wage war. He describes imperialism as  "a monotonous record of one sided slaughter" (p.&amp;nbsp;75) He argues that there was an end of limited war between 'great powers' after 1870 (p.&amp;nbsp;44). After that we had 1914 and the period of total or world war until 1946. Then the period of [[Cold War]] in which the public appearances of a strategic balance of power became more important than the reality of a balance of actual power. The [[A-bomb]] made a balance of actual power obsolete (p.&amp;nbsp;62).

==People's war - wars of national self-determination==

The first modern [[people's war]] was the Spanish resistance to the French invasion 1807-14 (p.&amp;nbsp;68). A people's war that showed how a superior force can be worn down by lesser military strength contrary to the classic rules of conventional warfare. The main need was to endure, and an armed population. [[George Washington]] also understood this need to endure. "Washington was always aware that his most important task was to insure the survival of his own forces - not strictly for military purposes but to personify the unconquerable will of the American people" (p.&amp;nbsp;157).

The big downside of people's war is that the whole people then become subject to retaliation (p.&amp;nbsp;81). In the Japanese retaliation against the Chinese communists, the population dropped from 45 million to 25 million. With this level of violence, political ideals are what buoys the resistance up. It also allowed humanitarian treatment of prisoners by the communist forces to be maintained. 

In a people's war it is important that war is kept subordinate to politics. This is the first stage of extracting politics from the war machine. Politics here means the creation of a civil administration from the ground up. For [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] the most important goal and foundation of this politics was the redistribution of land from rich to poor.

A militarised politics can easily segue into a totalitarian politics as it did in China via [[conventional warfare]] against the American-backed [[Kuomintang]]. 

People's war became the principal instrument of self-determination and social change in the third world from around the 1950s. If a population is united, an imperial war against it is difficult to win. [[Charles de Gaulle]] understood this in relation to [[Algeria]] in 1958. Even when he had achieved a military victory it did not lead to a political one.

==Cold war==

The nuclear standoff produced a stalemate in the war system. The last resort was unusable. '"In both (nuclear deterrence and people war) violence became not so much an instrument for producing physical effects as a kind of bloody system of communication, through which the antagonists produced messages to one another about will." (p.&amp;nbsp;97) Nuclear deterrence became a conflict waged by appearances to produce intangible effects on leaderships and populations. People's war also came to be decided by intangible effects on hearts and minds of both sides. In both situations the capacity of violence for achieving political ends is thrown into doubt.

==Revolution==

A similar mindset of belief in violence pervaded western theories of revolution. Right, left and centre theorists and leaders agreed that that revolution had to be violent. Power was only understood as an effect of violent coercive rule. (except for a few voices, e.g., [[Tolstoy]])

Two expressly political theorists thought consistently about [[nonviolence]]: Mahatma Gandhi and Hannah Arendt.

==Mohandas K. Gandhi==

[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] believed that courage was a more important attribute of those seeking liberation than a desire for nonviolence or [[Satyagraha]]. At one point he even acted as conscription agent for the British military in South Africa. (date?) Gandhi appealed to the 'spiritual' strength of Indian peoples to oppose the Western Imperial (war) system.

The assumption here is that tyrants and ruling classes alike only have the power that we invest in them. Give them nothing and they are naked and have no power. "The  central role of consent in all government meant that non-cooperation - the withdrawal of consent - was something more than a morally satisfying activity; it was a powerful weapon in the real world." (p.&amp;nbsp;129) "Non-cooperation is not a passive state, it is an intensely active state - more active than physical resistance or violence."' (p.&amp;nbsp;130) Schell quoting from ''Gandhi's Essential Writings'' (p.&amp;nbsp;99)

The Gandhi programme of Satyagraha ("the quiet and irresistible pursuit of truth") was accompanied by 'the constructive programme'. This campaigned and organised to achieve concrete goals such as justice for workers, peace between factions, village hygiene and diet, the condition of women, etc. The idea is to do anything that obstructed the solidarity of the nation and that facilitates the production of a democratic political culture. "Constructive effort is political power" ''Gandhi's Essential Writings'' (p.&amp;nbsp;259)

==Revolutions and violence==

Schell looks for the nonviolent actions that are part of what are often represented as broadly violent revolutions. (p.&amp;nbsp;143) He defines violence: "Violence is the method by which the ruthless few can subdue the passive many. Non-violence is a means by which the active many can overcome the ruthless few." (p.&amp;nbsp;144). He discusses [[The Glorious Revolution]] of 1689 in England and the American, French and Russian Revolutions. He makes the interesting observation that revolutions are typified as violent and the subsequent establishment of a new regime is assumed to be peaceful, whereas the reverse has "more often been the case". (p.&amp;nbsp;144) in the French revolution, the American, even the Russian...(p.&amp;nbsp;175) (p.&amp;nbsp;178). More people died making Potemkin the film than in the actual storming of the Winter Palace! [[The Russian Revolution]] was more of a victory of a 'mass minority' ... than a real people's revolution as happened in France or America (p.&amp;nbsp;183).

The English 'Glorious Revolution' of 1689 "London was in fact the first of many modern capitals whose rebellious spirit was to infect and destroy the allegiance of an army of an [[ancien regime]]". This was [[William III of England|William of Orange]] versus [[James II of England|King James]], with defections at the non-battle at Salisbury.

There has been a near universal failure of theorists to predict the non-violent fall of powers. He quotes [[Thomas Paine]]: "Tis not in numbers but in unity that our great strength lies". In the American Revolution [[Committees of Correspondence]] were formed for "mutually fostering and co-ordinating activity". These were the basic political units.

[[Edmund Burke]] realised that it is only by cultivating the love and admiration of the people that a ruler can raise taxes or an army or get voted in. This love "infuses into (army and navy) that liberal obedience without which your army would be base rabble and you navy nothing but rotten timber" (p.&amp;nbsp;159).

==East Europe==

Schell's sources here are [[Adam Michnik]], [[Václav Havel]] and [[György Konrád]] as sources to explain the 'unsuspected' weakness of the Soviet empire. In their beginnings they "did not aim at state power" (p.&amp;nbsp;191) but aimed at "achieving immediate changes in daily life" within what was called 'civil society' a term that goes back to Paine. (p.&amp;nbsp;194)

The setting up of institutions independent from the state or the ruling classes... is the key activity in preparing for a peoples revolution. In Eastern Europe this took the form of civic and cultural activity (p.&amp;nbsp;195), e.g., [[Workers' Defence Committee]] provided concrete assistance to those in trouble with the authorities, and their families. Other terms for similar activity:

* flying university
* parallel structures
* second culture
* revolutionary councils' (Arendt)

[[Václav Havel]] suggested there should be no discourse with the centre of power but that activists should "fight only for those concrete causes, and fight for them unswervingly to the end" (p.&amp;nbsp;196). Compare this with Gandhi's earlier call for courage . Chosen well these independent institutions will rattle the establishment. The idea of cultivating 'a predisposition to truth' (Havel/ Gandhi) is seen as key (p.&amp;nbsp;197).  

The final [[collapse of the USSR]] is not like the rest of Eastern Europe as it was a mainly top down operation rather than one of peoples power. There was still a remarkable and unexpected lack of violence.

The main thesis is reiterated: "The professionals of power, in or out of government, were consistently caught off-guard by the failures of superior force and the successes of nonviolence" (p.&amp;nbsp;216). Contemporary political theory could 'neither foresee nor explain' the successes of non-violent [[people power]].

==Hannah Arendt's ideas of power==

[[Hannah Arendt]]'s redefinition of the word 'power' &lt;ref&gt;On Violence, paperback edition, 
Hannah Arendt, 1970, {{ISBN|0-15-669500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a strong echo from Paine. She says: "Power corresponds to the human ability not just to act but to act in concert."&lt;ref&gt;On Violence, paperback edition, Hannah Arendt, 1970, {{ISBN|0-15-669500-6}}, page 44&lt;/ref&gt; (Schell p.&amp;nbsp;218). She goes so far as to deny ascription of 'power' to individual action.

[[Max Weber]] is probably more realistic in asserting that power is the assertion of will in a social relationship. (p.&amp;nbsp;220) But this does mean that in limiting its meaning [[Hannah Arendt]] can discuss political power in more detail. The assertion of the will of the tyrant is ultimately an illusion, the tyrant is dependent on his supporters.
Violence can never create real political power in Arendt's sense: "To substitute violence for power can bring victory, but the price is very high; for it is not only paid by the vanquished, it is also paid by the victor in terms of his own power." &lt;ref&gt;On Violence, paperback edition, Hannah Arendt, 1970, {{ISBN|0-15-669500-6}}, page 53&lt;/ref&gt; (Schell p.&amp;nbsp;222). According to [[John Stuart Mill]] public opinion guides will&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/mill/john_stuart/m645r/chapter1.html Representative Government by John Stuart Mill]&lt;/ref&gt; and "a great part of all power consists in... willing allegiance" (Schell p.&amp;nbsp;229).

==Nonviolent change in liberal democracy?==

Schell sees the 'taming of violence' being written into liberalisms 'genetic code'. His example is the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the USA. Although he sees nonviolent action being only 'curative' or reforming of a liberal democratic system.

'''Thomas Griffin''' (January 1, 1889 – September 29, 1915) and '''Meeks Griffin''' were brothers and prominent black farmers who lived in [[Chester County, South Carolina]]. They were executed via the [[electric chair]] in 1915 for the murder in 1913 of 75-year-old John Q. Lewis, a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veteran of Blackstock.

The Griffin brothers were convicted based on the accusations of another black man, John "Monk" Stevenson, who was known to be a small-time thief. Stevenson who was found in possession of the victim's pistol, was sentenced to life in prison in exchange for testifying against the brothers.

Two other African Americans, Nelson Brice and John Crosby, were executed with the brothers for the same crime.

However, some in the community believed that the murder might have been the result of Lewis's suspected sexual relationship with 22-year-old Anna Davis. Davis and her husband were never tried, possibly for fear of a [[miscegenation]] scandal.

The Griffin brothers, who were believed to be the wealthiest blacks in the area, sold their {{convert|138|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm to pay for their defense against the accusations.

Over 100 people petitioned Gov. Richard Manning to commute the brothers' sentence. The signatories included prominent people including Blackstock's mayor, a sheriff, two trial jurors and the grand jury foreman. Nevertheless, they were sent to the electric chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2010066394_pardon15.html?syndication=rss | title=Radio host Tom Joyner clears his family's name | publisher=The Seattle Times | date=2009-10-15 | accessdate=2009-10-18 | first=Seanna | last=Adcox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Grampus'' (SS-207)''', a [[Tambor class submarine|''Tambor''-class]] [[submarine]], was the sixth ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for a member of the [[dolphin]] family ([[Delphinidae]]): ''Grampus griseus'', also known as [[Risso's dolphin]].

Her keel was laid down by the [[Electric Boat]] Company of [[Groton, Connecticut]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 23 December 1940 (sponsored by Mrs. Clark H. Woodward) and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 23 May 1941 at [[New London, Connecticut]], with Lieutenant Commander Edward S. Hutchinson in command. 
''Grampus'' received three battle stars for [[World War II]] service. Her first, fourth, and fifth war patrols were designated successful.

==Operational history==

===Pacific===

After shakedown in [[Long Island Sound]], ''Grampus'' sailed to the [[Caribbean Sea]] with {{USS|Grayback|SS-208|3}} on 8 September to conduct a modified war patrol, returning to [[New London, Connecticut]], on 28 September. The Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] found ''Grampus'' undergoing post-shakedown overhaul at [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], but soon ready for war on 22 December, she sailed for the Pacific, reaching Pearl Harbor on 1 February 1942, via the [[Panama Canal]] and [[Mare Island]].

On her first war patrol from 8 February to 4 April 1942, ''Grampus'' sank an 8636-ton tanker Kaijo Maru No.2 4 March 1942, the only kill of her short career&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/2919.html Uboat net]&lt;/ref&gt;, and reconnoitered [[Kwajalein]] and [[Wotje]] atolls, later the scene of bloody but successful landings. ''Grampus''' second patrol en route to [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], [[Australia]], and her third patrol from that base were marred by a heavy number of antisubmarine patrol craft off [[Truk Lagoon]] and poor visibility as heavy rains haunted her path along the [[Luzon]] and [[Mindoro]] coasts.

Taking aboard four [[Coastwatchers|coast watchers]], ''Grampus'' sailed from Fremantle on 2 October 1942 for her fourth war patrol. Despite the presence of Japanese [[destroyer]]s, she landed the coast watchers on [[Vella Lavella]] and [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]] islands while conducting her patrol. This patrol, during the height of the [[Guadalcanal]] campaign, took ''Grampus'' into waters teeming with Japanese men-of-war. She sighted a total of four enemy [[cruiser]]s and 79 destroyers in five different convoys. Although she conducted a series of aggressive attacks on the Japanese ships, receiving 104 depth charges for her work, ''Grampus'' was not credited with sinking any ships. On 18 October 1942 ''Grampus'' even scored a direct hit on the ''[[Japanese cruiser Yura|Yura]]'', but the torpedo failed to explode. She returned to Australia on 23 November.

''Grampus''' fifth war patrol, from 14 December 1942 to 19 January 1943, took her across access lanes frequented by Japanese submarines and other ships. Air and water patrol in this area was extremely heavy and although she conducted several daring attacks on the 41 contacts she sighted, ''Grampus'' again was denied a kill.

==Sinking==

In company with ''Grayback'', ''Grampus'' departed [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]] on 11 February 1943 for her sixth war patrol, from which she failed to return; the manner of her loss still remains a mystery. Japanese seaplanes reported sinking a submarine on 18 February in ''Grampus''' patrol area, but ''Grayback'' reported seeing ''Grampus'' in that same area 4 March. On 19th February the "Granpus" is believed to have damaged the "Keiyo Maru" [6442 GRT]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/2919.html Uboat. Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; and 27 February 1943 also damaged the IJN Minesweeper W.22&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/2919.html U boat Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;. On 5 March 1943, the Japanese destroyers {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Minegumo|1937|2}} and ''[[Japanese destroyer Murasame (1937)|Murasame]]'' conducted an attack preceding the [[Battle of Blackett Strait]], near [[Kolombangara]] island. A heavy oil slick was sighted there the following day, indicating that ''Grampus'' may have been lost there in a night attack or gun battle against the destroyers. The Japanese destroyers had by then already been sunk in a night action with U.S. cruisers and destroyers.

When repeated attempts failed to contact ''Grampus'', the submarine was declared missing and presumed lost with all hands. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 21 June 1943.

'''Umberto Boccioni''' ({{IPA-it|umˈbɛrto botˈtʃoːni}}; 19 October 1882 – 17 August 1916) was an influential Italian painter and sculptor. He helped shape the revolutionary aesthetic of the [[Futurism]] movement as one of its principal figures. Despite his short life, his approach to the dynamism of form and the deconstruction of solid mass guided artists long after his death.{{r|MoMA}} His works are held by many public art museums, and in 1988 the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City organized a major retrospective of 100 pieces.{{r|NYT1988}}

==Biography==
Umberto Boccioni was born on 19 October 1882 in [[Reggio Calabria]]. His father was a minor government employee, originally from the [[Romagna]] region in the north, and his job included frequent reassignments throughout Italy. The family soon relocated further north, and Umberto and his older sister Amelia grew up in [[Forlì]] ([[Emilia-Romagna]]), [[Genoa]] and finally [[Padua]]. At the age of 15, in 1897, Umberto and his father moved to [[Catania, Sicily]], where he would finish school. Some time after 1898, he moved to Rome and studied art at the [[Scuola Libera del Nudo]] of the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma]].{{r|Coen}}

The little known about his years in Rome is found in the autobiography of his friend [[Gino Severini]] (1883–1966), who recalled their meeting in 1901 and mutual interest in [[Nietzsche]], rebellion, life experiences and socialism. Boccioni's writings at this time already express the combination of outrage and irony that would become a lifelong characteristic. His critical and rebellious nature, and overall intellectual ability, would contribute substantially to the development of the [[Futurism]] movement. After building a foundation of skills, having studied the classics through Impressionism, both he and Severini became students of [[Giacomo Balla]] (1871–1958), a painter focusing on the modern [[Chromoluminarism|Divisionist]] technique, painting with divided rather than mixed color and breaking the painted surface into a field of stippled dots and stripes. Severini wrote "It was a great stroke of luck for us to meet such a man, whose direction was decisive of all our careers."{{r|Coen}}
[[File:Umberto Boccioni - Self-portrait, oil on canvas, 1905, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|Self portrait, 1905, oil on canvas]]
In 1906, he briefly moved to Paris, where he studied [[Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionist]] styles, before visiting Russia for three months, getting a first-hand view of the civil unrest and governmental crackdowns. Returning to Italy in 1907, he briefly took drawing classes at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Accademia di Belle Arti of Venice]]. He had first visited the Famiglia Artistica, a society for artists in [[Milan]], in 1901.

Boccioni moved to Milan in 1907. There, early in 1908, he met the Divisionist painter [[Gaetano Previati]]. In early 1910 he met [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], who had already published his ''[[Manifesto del Futurismo]]'' ("Manifesto of Futurism") in the previous year.{{r|trecc}} On 11 February 1910 Boccioni, with Balla, [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Luigi Russolo]] and Severini, signed the ''Manifesto dei pittori futuristi'' ("Manifesto of Futurist painters"), and on 8 March he read the manifesto at the Politeama Chiarella theatre in Turin.{{r|trecc|NYM}}

Boccioni became the main theorist of the [[Art movement|artistic movement]].{{r|NYT2004}} "Only when Boccioni, Severini and a few other Futurists traveled to Paris and saw what Braque and Picasso had been doing did the movement begin to take real shape."{{r|NYT1989}} He also decided to be a sculptor after he visited various studios in Paris, in 1912, including those of [[Georges Braque]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], August Agero and, probably, [[Medardo Rosso]].{{r|Coen}} In 1912 he exhibited some paintings together with other Italian futurists at the Galerie [[Bernheim-Jeune]], and the following year returned to show his sculptures at the Galerie La Boétie: all related to the elaboration of what Boccioni had seen in Paris, they in their turn probably influenced the [[Cubist sculpture|Cubist sculptors]], especially Duchamp-Villon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=dNapCh3BLUEC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=umberto+boccioni+decided+to+be+a+sculptor+after+he+visited+various+studios+in+Paris,+in+1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBuqy0lezXAhWB7BQKHSymByMQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=archipenko&amp;f=false Christine Poggi, ''In Defiance of Painting: Cubism, Futurism, and the Invention of Collage''], Yale University Press, 1992, pp. 20, 177, {{ISBN|0300051093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the brief life span of the Italian Futurist movement, the short-lived Umberto Boccioni was a blazing comet. ... Boccioni was a fiery theoretician of the movement, drafting two Futurist manifestoes in 1910 and 1912 that exalted the force and energy of contemporary life. They called for an art that glorified speed, violence and the machine age, one that above all reflected the dynamism of an engine-driven civilization."{{r|NYT98G}} --Grace Glueck, New York Times Art Critic
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1914 he published ''Pittura e scultura futuriste (dinamismo plastico)'' explaining the [[aesthetics]] of the group:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"While the impressionists paint a picture to give one particular moment and subordinate the life of the picture to its resemblance to this moment, we synthesize every moment (time, place, form, color-tone) and thus paint the picture.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He exhibited in London, together with the group, in 1912 ([[Sackville Gallery]]) and 1914 (Doré Gallery): the two exhibitions made a deep impression on a number of young English artists, in particular [[C.R.W. Nevinson]], who joined the movement. Others aligned themselves instead to its British equivalent, [[Vorticism]], led by [[Wyndham Lewis]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Boccioni's gift was to bring a fresh eye to reality in ways that, we now recognise, defined the nature of the modern movement in the visual arts and literature, too."{{r|Indep}} --Michael Glover (art critic, [[The Independent]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Italian involvement in the [[First World War]] began late in May 1915 with Italy's declaration of war on Austro-Hungary. The "Lombard Battalion Volunteers Cyclists and Motorists", which Boccioni was part of, set off in early June from Milan to [[Gallarate]], then on to [[Peschiera del Garda]], in the rear of the [[Trentino]] front. In July 1915, the volunteers were intended for a sector of the front around [[Ala, Trentino|Ala]] and the Gardesana. On 24 October 1915, Boccioni participated in the battle of Dosso Casina. On 1 December 1915 the battalion was dissolved as part of a general reorganization; the volunteers were laid off temporarily, then each was called up along with the class. In May 1916 Boccioni was drafted into the [[Italian Army]], and was assigned to an artillery regiment at Sorte of Chievo, near [[Verona]]. On 16 August 1916, he was thrown from his horse during a cavalry training exercise and was trampled.{{r|Guardian2009|gugg}} He died the following day, age thirty-three.

==Works==
[[File:Umberto Boccioni, 1909-10, Three Women (Tre donne).jpg|thumb|''[[Three Women (Boccioni)|Three Women]]'', 1909–10]]
[[File:The Morning by Umberto Boccioni, 1909.jpg|thumb|left|''The Morning'', 1909]]'''Early portraits and landscapes'''
From 1902 to 1910, Boccioni focused initially on drawings, then sketched and painted portraits – with his mother as a frequent model. He also painted landscapes – often including the arrival of industrialization, trains and factories for example. During this period, he weaves between [[Pointillism]] and [[Impressionism]], and the influence of Giacomo Balla, and [[Divisionism]] techniques are evident in early paintings (although later largely abandoned). ''The Morning'' (1909) was noted for "the bold and youthful violence of hues" and as "a daring exercise in luminosity."{{r|Coen}} His 1909–10 ''Three Women'', which portrays his mother and sister, and longtime lover Ines at center, was cited as expressing great emotion – strength, melancholy and love.{{r|Coen}}

===Development of Futurism===
[[File:The City Rises by Umberto Boccioni 1910.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The City Rises (Boccioni)|The City Rises]]'', 1910]]
Initially titled ''Il lavoro'' (Labor), Boccioni worked for nearly a year on ''La città sale'' or ''[[The City Rises (Boccioni)|The City Rises]]'', 1910, a huge (2m by 3m) painting, which is considered his turning point into Futurism. "I attempted a great synthesis of labor, light and movement" he wrote to a friend.{{r|Coen}} Upon its exhibition in [[Milan]] in May 1911, the painting attracted numerous reviews, mostly admiring. By 1912 it had become a headline painting for the exhibition traveling Europe, the introduction to Futurism. It was sold to the great pianist, [[Ferruccio Busoni]] for 4,000 lire that year,{{r|Coen}} and today is frequently on prominent display at the Museum of Modern art in New York, at the entrance to the paintings department.{{r|MoMA}}

[[File:Umberto Boccioni - Laughter.jpg|thumb|right|''The Laugh'', 1911]]
''La risata'' (1911, ''The Laugh'') is considered his first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now focused on the sensations derived from his observation of modern life. Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with ''[[Three Women (Boccioni)|Three Women]]'', and it was defaced by a visitor, running his fingers through the still fresh paint.{{r|Coen}} Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in [[Berlin]], including ''[[The Street Enters the House]]'' (1911) which depicts a woman on a balcony overlooking a busy street. Today the former also is owned by the Museum of Modern Art,{{r|MoMA}} and the latter by the [[Sprengel Museum]] in [[Hanover]].{{r|Coen}}

Umberto Boccioni spent much of 1911 working on a trilogy of paintings titled "''Stati d'animo''" ("''States of Mind''"), which he said expressed departure and arrival at a railroad station – ''The Farewells'', ''Those Who Go'', and ''Those Who Stay''.{{r|Coen}} All three paintings were originally purchased by Marinetti, until [[Nelson Rockefeller]] acquired them from his widow and later donated them to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.{{r|MoMA|looted}}
[[File:Umberto Boccioni, 1912, Elasticity (Elasticità), oil on canvas, 100 x 100 cm, Museo del Novecento.jpg|thumb|left|''Elasticity'', 1912]]

[[File:Ritratto di Busoni, 1916 (Roberto Biccioni).jpg|thumb|right|''Portrait of [[Ferruccio Busoni]]'', 1916]]
Beginning in 1912, with ''Elasticità'' or ''Elasticity'', depicting the pure energy of a horse, captured with intense chromaticism, he completed a series of Dynamist paintings: ''Dinamismo di un corpo umano'' (''Human Body''), ''[[Dynamism of a Cyclist|ciclista]]'' (''Cyclist''), ''Foot-baller'', and by 1914 ''Dinamismo plastico: cavallo + caseggiato'' (''Plastic Dynamism: Horse + Houses'').

While continuing this focus, he revived his previous interest in portraiture. Beginning with ''L'antigrazioso'' (''The antigraceful'') in 1912 and continuing with ''I selciatori'' (''The Street Pavers'') and ''Il bevitore'' (''The Drinker'') both in 1914.

In 1914 Boccioni published his book, ''Pittura, scultura futuriste'' (''Futurist Painting and Sculpture''), which caused a rift between himself and some of his Futurist comrades. As a result, perhaps, he abandoned his exploration of Dynamism, and instead sought further decomposition of a subject by means of colour.{{r|Coen}} With ''Horizontal Volumes'' in 1915 and the ''Portrait of [[Ferruccio Busoni]]'' in 1916, he completed a full return to figurative painting. Perhaps fittingly, this last painting was a portrait of the maestro who purchased his first Futurist work, ''[[The City Rises (Boccioni)|The City Rises]]''.

===Sculpture===

[[File:Umberto Boccioni, Spiral Expansion of Muscles in Action, plaster, photograph published in 1914.jpg|thumb|right|''Spiral Expansion of Muscles in Action'', plaster, photograph published in 1914 and 1919, in ''Cubists and Post-Impressionism'', by [[Arthur Jerome Eddy]], and exhibited at ''Erster deutscher Herbstsalon'', Berlin 1913, [[Herwarth Walden]], titled ''Spiralförmige ausdehnung von muskeln in bewegung''. Published 1913 catalogue by [[Der Sturm]] in Berlin]]
The writing of his {{lang|it|Manifesto tecnico della scultura futurista}} (''Technical manifesto of Futurist sculpture''), published on 11 April 1912, was Boccioni's intellectual and physical launch into sculpture; he had begun working in sculpture in the previous year.{{r|trecc}} Much of his experimental work from late 1912 to 1913 was destroyed, including pieces relating to contemporaneous paintings, which are known only through photographs. One of the few surviving pieces is the ''[[Antigrazioso]]'' also called ''The Mother''.

Yet by the end of 1913 he had completed what is considered his masterpiece, ''Forme uniche della continuità nello spazio'' (''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]''), in wax. His goal for the work was to depict a "synthetic continuity" of motion, instead of an "analytical discontinuity" that he saw in such artists as [[František Kupka]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]].{{r|journal}} During his life, the work only existed as a plaster cast. It was first cast in bronze in 1931.{{r|MetUFCS}} This sculpture has been the subject of extensive commentary, and in 1998 it was selected as the image to be engraved on the back of the [[Italian euro coins|Italian 20-cent euro coin]].

'''W. Brady''' was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[association football|footballer]] who played in [[the Football League]] for [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joyce|first=Michael|title=Football League Players' Records 1888 to 1939|year=2004|publisher=SoccerData|isbn=1-899468-67-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing Career==
W Brady was signed by [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in December 1888 and made his debut at Turf Moor, Burnley, on 08-Dec-1888 against [[Stoke F.C.|Stoke]]. He was selected to play inside-right in place of [[Willie McKay]] who moved to inside-left. He made an immediate impact. In a "strong fought physical encounter" play often stopped for injury. After one such break W Brady got the ball and put Burnley ahead and it remained 1-0 at half-time. The second half was more even but Burnley managed to go 2-0 up on the hour. Both sides pressed but defences held until Stoke guaranteed an exciting finish by making 2-1 with ten minutes left. The Burnley defence held on and got an important win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Metcalf|first=Mark|title=The Origins of the Football League|year=2013|publisher=Amberley|isbn=978 1 4456 1881 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Brady was ever-present from the Stoke game and played 9 times and scored 2 goals. He played 7 times at inside-right and twice at outside-right. Brady also played in both FA Cup ties played by Burnley in 1889 and he scored in the First Round tie against Old Westminsters which Burnley won 4-3. Burnley finished 9th in the League and scored 42 goals in 22 games. Burnley were knocked out of the FA Cup in the Second Round by [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= English National Football Archive| first=| last=| url=http://www.enfa.co.uk//| accessdate=2018-01-11}} (registration &amp; fee required)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6654">'''William VI''' (c. 1173 – 17 September 1226) was the tenth [[Marquess of Montferrat]] from 1203 and titular [[King of Thessalonica]] from 1207.

==Biography==
===Youth===
[[Boniface I of Montferrat|Boniface I]]'s eldest son, and his only son by his first wife, Helena del Bosco, William stood originally to inherit all his father's possessions. He participated in diverse campaigns with his father, including the [[Battle of Montiglio]], in which the men of [[Asti]] were defeated in 1191. Between 1193 and 1199, he appeared in many of his father's public acts. On 12 June 1199, he was put in charge of [[Acqui Terme]] with twenty knights to combat the [[Alessandria|Alessandrini]], and, on 27 October, he was present near [[Saluggia]] for the signing of a pact with the commune of [[Vercelli]].

===War with Asti===
Boniface I joined the [[Fourth Crusade]] as a Christian leader in 1203. In accordance with promises made to Asti and Alessandria, he officially abdicated the marquisate to William before he left. Immediately, William turned towards Asti, then protected by [[Milan]]. The Astigiani had a history of rebellion and were growing in power. In August, with his father beside him, he formed an alliance with [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]] and Alessandria, another rebellious commune, against Asti. His allies proved of little worth as he had to make many concessions to them and was still defeated in the field. In April 1206, he opened negotiations with Asti. The peace treaty was embarrassing for Montferrat, but it was accepted by all three allies. William promised to get his father's ratification, but his father was killed fighting against the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] unaware of any peace back home.

===War against the Ghibellines===
Traditionally, the [[Aleramici]] adhered to the [[Ghibelline]] faction, which supported the [[Hohenstaufen]] and their Italian schemes. William, however, lent his support to [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] claimant to the imperial title. Though William expected to see the power of an emperor levelled against his foes, the only aid he received from Otto was directed against small local potentates which posed little real threat. The only great success of the alliance was the sack of [[Cuneo]].

At the [[Diet of Lodi]], William abandoned Otto finally in favour of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the Hohenstaufen claimant. On 15 July 1212, he was in [[Genoa]] with the other Ghibelline lords to receive Frederick. William led the young emperor from the city to the road which led to [[Germany]]. In 1215, William participated in the [[Second Lateran Council]], there arguing the cause of Frederick against Otto. He travelled many subsequent times into Germany to speak to Frederick and during these absences, his enemies plotted against him. In their attempts to seize his lands, however, they were largely unsuccessful.

During his times in Italy, William remained at war with Asti and Alessandria, but without result.

===Claims in Greece===
Following his father's death in 1207, his conquests in Greece, formed into the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], passed into the hands of William's half-brother [[Demetrius of Montferrat|Demetrius]]. The succession was opposed by the Lombard nobles of the kingdom, led by the regent [[Oberto II of Biandrate]], who preferred the crown to pass to William. William himself was reluctant to claim the throne, and with the support of [[Latin Emperor]] [[Henry of Flanders]], the rebellion of the Lombard barons was overcome, and Demetrius was crowned king.

During the exhausting years battling rebels and Guelphs, William at last resolved to travel to Greece to defend the conquests of his father. To this end he was urged by the churchmen of his realm and also by the [[troubadour]] [[Elias Cairel]]. When he finally decided to take the cross, aware of the insignificance of his contribution to the total effort, he decided to head by way of [[Egypt]], at the suggestion of [[Pope Honorius III]]. But the arrival of Demetrius, fleeing the onslaught of the Greeks under [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] and the hostility of the Lombard barons, led by Biandrate, convinced him to go to Greece.

Several times he prepared to head out, but each time was detained by the threats of his enemies in [[Piedmont]] or by economic restraints which compelled him to mortgage his marquisate to Frederick II. Finally, he cowed some cities into giving him aid in men. Nevertheless, he was present at [[Capua]], [[Ferentino]], and [[Sora, Lazio|Sora]] with Frederick II in February 1223. Delayed again and again, he drank a toast at [[Brindisi]] to his setting off in 1225, but he fell ill at the last minute. His fleet remained in port until Spring 1226, when, under urging from Honorius, it finally cast off. The delays had been fatal and William himself died at [[Almyros]] on 17 September. The rest of his army was hit by a [[dysentery]] epidemic and melted away.

==Marriages and children==
On 9 August 1202 William married Berta (1182–1224), daughter of the Marquess Bonifacio di Clavesana, Count of Cortemiglia. They had at least three children: 
* [[Boniface II, Marquess of Montferrat]] (born ca 1203, date of death unknown).
* [[Beatrice of Montferrat|Beatrice]] (ca 1210–1274), Lady of Saint-Bonnet in her own right. She married three times:
** On 15 November 1219, [[Guigues VI of Viennois]]
** In 1252, Guy II, Lord of Bauge
** Pierre de la Roue
* [[Alix of Montferrat|Alix]] (ca. 1215–1232), married in May 1229 [[Henry I of Cyprus|Henry I of Lusignan, King of Cyprus]].
*[[Oddone di Monferrato]] (died 1251), who became [[Bishop of Porto]], and Cardinal in 1227, may have been a son of William VI; whether he was legitimate or not is uncertain.

'''Élisa Beetz-Charpentier''' (born '''Jeanne Élisa Henriette Beetz'''&lt;ref name="Geni"&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Jeanne-%C3%89lisa-Beetz/6000000067809854856 Jeanne Élisa Henriette Beetz] – [[Geni.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;; 1859 in [[Schaerbeek]], Belgium – 1949 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], France)&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/espace-professionnels/professionnels/chercheurs/rech-rec-art-home/notice-artiste.html?nnumid=2686 ''Elisa Beetz-Charpentier''.] In: [[Musée d’Orsay]]&lt;/ref&gt; was a French sculptor, [[medallist]] and painter.

Her second husband was [[Alexandre Charpentier]] and the witnesses at their wedding in 1908 were [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Auguste Rodin]].&lt;ref&gt;Jana Wijnsouw: [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=THE3DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT393 ''National Identity and Nineteenth-Century Franco-Belgian Sculpture.''] Routledge, 2017, {{ISBN|1-35177-814-5}}, S.&amp;nbsp;393.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the research of Polish [[heraldist]] Jerzy Michta published in 2017, the version of the [[coat of arms of Poland]] used since 1927, designed by artist Zygmunt Kamiński, was actually plagiarized from a 1924 plaque by Elisa Beetz-Charpentier made in honor of [[Ignacy Paderewski]].&lt;ref name="RP"&gt;Wiktor Ferfecki: [https://www.rp.pl/Historia/310289962-Godlo-Polski-jest-plagiatem.html Godło Polski jest plagiatem?].
