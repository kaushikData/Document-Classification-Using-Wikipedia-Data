'''''ACCC v Cabcharge Australia Ltd''''' is a 2010 decision of the [[Federal Court of Australia]] brought by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) against [[Cabcharge Australia Ltd]].&lt;ref name=FCA1261&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|1261|2010|litigants=ACCC v Cabcharge Australia Ltd |courtname=auto}}; {{cite AustLII|FCA|837|2010|litigants=ACCC v Cabcharge Australia Ltd (No 2) |courtname=auto}}. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the ACCC began proceedings in the Federal Court against Cabcharge alleging that Cabcharge had breached section 46 of the Commonwealth [[Trade Practices Act]] (TPA) by misusing its market power and entering into an agreement to substantially lessen competition. The action alleged [[predatory pricing]] by Cabcharge and centred on Cabcharge's conduct in [[refusal to deal|refusing to deal]] with competing suppliers to allow Cabcharge payments to be processed through [[EFTPOS]] terminals provided by rival companies and supplying taxi meters and fare updates at below actual cost or at no cost.&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;

In September 2010, to settle the action, Cabcharge admitted a number of contraventions of TPA and the Federal Court imposed a fine of $15 million ($14 million in civil penalties and $1 million in costs), the highest ever penalty imposed for misuse of market power. The judgement was delivered by Justice [[Raymond Finkelstein]] on 17 November 2010.

==Background==
Cabcharge provides various products and services in Australia and overseas, predominantly to taxi drivers, owners and networks (the firms that provide booking and dispatch services to drivers and owners). The services that Cabcharge provide include non-cash payment processing systems for taxi fares, payment processing systems for taxis and provision of taxi meters. The company holds a dominant market position in these services across Australia as it supplies almost 97% of Australian taxis with its electronic payment system.

The ACCC began proceedings in June 2009 in the Federal Court against Cabcharge Australia Ltd. The ACCC action alleged that Cabcharge had breached section 46 of the Trade Practices Act (TPA) by misusing its market power and entering into an agreement to substantially lessen competition. The action alleged [[predatory pricing]] by Cabcharge and centred on Cabcharge's conduct in refusing to deal with competing suppliers to allow Cabcharge payments to be processed through EFTPOS terminals provided by rival companies and supplying taximeters and meter updates at below actual cost or at no cost.&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;
 
At the relevant date, to breach Section 46 of the TPA, a corporation must have misused its substantial market power to:
 
* eliminate or substantially damage a competitor 
* prevent the entry of a person into that market or any other market; or	
* deter or prevent a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that market or any other market.
 
Section 46 of the TPA was amended numerous times since September 2007 to strengthen the ACCC's ability to successfully bring proceedings for alleged contraventions. For example, in September 2007, a sub-section 46(1AA) was introduced into the TPA to prohibit corporations with substantial market share from engaging in [[predatory pricing]]. Predatory pricing occurs when a company sets its prices below cost for a sustained period for one of the [[anti-competitive]] purposes referred to above. In November 2008, the TPA was amended again to make clear the circumstances when corporations had 'taken advantage' of their market power. This change sought to deal with the evidentiary difficulties the regulator encountered in establishing this element in earlier cases. Since January 2007, the courts have also been given power to impose a [[civil penalty]] for each act or omission contravening the TPA. Civil penalties can now be imposed up to the greater of $10 million, three times the value of the benefit obtained from the misconduct, or 10% of the annual Australian turnover of the company involved.

==Resolution==
===Cabcharge admissions===
To settle the proceedings, Cabcharge admitted to three contraventions of the TPA. The company agreed to the issue by the court of declarations, compliance orders, civil penalties of $14 million and costs of $1 million.&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;

=== Cabcharge settlement ===
On 24 September 2010, Justice Finkelstein approved the settlement of the action and declared that Cabcharge had breached the TPA by taking advantage of its substantial degree of power in the Australian markets for the supply of services to enable non-cash payments for taxi fares and charges by taxi passengers and non-cash instruments that could be used only for the payment of taxi fares and charges.

==Judgement==

===Refusal to deal===
It was found that since 2005 Cabcharge had unreasonably refused to deal with a potential competitor (namely Travel Tab which had changed its name to Mpos in January 2007) in the payments and instruments markets by refusing to allow Travel Tab/MPos to process Cabcharge instruments (e.g., Cabcharge cards) on Mpos EFTPOS equipment. It was found that: "With respect to both refusals, Cabcharge acknowledges that although there would have been time and costs involved in developing appropriate interfaces, there was no technical reason that would prevent any electronic taxi-specific payment product from being processed by any EFTPOS terminal as long as that taxi-specific instrument and the relevant EFTPOS terminals complied with all relevant banking/financial industry protocols, including security protocols."

It was found that: "Cabcharge’s refusals were for the purpose of preventing Travel Tab/MPos from processing Cabcharge instruments electronically and resulted in Cabcharge’s payment processing system remaining the only system that processed Cabcharge’s instruments electronically."&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;

===Predatory pricing===
Between September 2004 and October 2007 Cabcharge acquired taximeters at a cost of $250 per meter. Of these, Cabcharge supplied approximately 727 units free of charge and approximately 5613 units at an invoiced price of $100 (of which it did not obtain any payment for approximately 758 units). At the time its competitors sold meters for between $430–550 plus GST. Cabcharge installed 197 meters free of charge at an estimated cost of $120 to $160 per installation. From 9 November 2007, it sold meters at a retail price of $250.

In addition, Cabcharge supplied meter updates free to networks and operators, notwithstanding that it incurred costs of around $75,000 to supply these updates. At the time its competitors charged $70 to $110 plus GST per update. Cabcharge funded its losses from profits it made from its payment processing systems.

It was found that Cabcharge took advantage of the substantial degree of power it had in the payment processing market for the purposes of: (1) affecting the profitability of other suppliers of meters and updates; (2) ensuring that other suppliers of meters and updates could not match or be price competitive with Cabcharge; and (3) ensuring that alternative suppliers did not commence supplying electronic processing services.&lt;ref name=FCA1261/&gt;

'''''American Jobs''''' is a 2004 [[independent film]], [[Documentary film|documentary]], written, produced and directed by Greg Spotts. The film is about the loss of American jobs to low-wage foreign competition, covering the phenomenon of [[outsourcing]] in manufacturing and high-paying white-collar jobs. The [[filmmaker]] visited 19 cities and towns throughout the [[United States]] interviewing recently laid-off workers, focusing on three industries: textiles, commercial aircraft and information technology. It also contains interviews with a number of members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], including: [[Sherrod Brown]] (D-Ohio), [[Rosa DeLauro]] (D-Connecticut), [[Robin Hayes]] (R-North Carolina), [[Donald Manzullo]] (R-Illinois), and [[Hilda Solis]] (D-California), and includes an extended section of clips from the 1993 congressional debate on [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]]. (North American Free Trade Agreement).

Spotts self-released the film on DVD via a website on Labor Day, 2004. The CNN program ''Lou Dobbs Tonight'' featured excerpts from ''American Jobs'' on seven consecutive weeknights in September 2004, exposure which attracted a distribution deal. The Disinformation Company, publisher of Robert Greenwald's series of documentary DVDs, released ''American Jobs'' on DVD in February 2005, along with a companion book penned by Spotts, ''CAFTA and Free Trade: What Every American Should Know''.  The book was used as a lobbying tool by the AFL-CIO and members of the US Congress during the summer of 2005 when Congress was debating ratification of the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]].

Spotts subsequently wrote the official companion book to Robert Greenwald's 2005 documentary ''[[Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price]]''.

== Family and personal life ==
In a 2017 interview with ''[[The Times]]'', Andrey discussed an early interest in communication technology. According to Andreev, at ten years old he built a radio out of electronic hardware he found around his family home, which he successfully used to chat to a friend a block away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/meet-andrey-andreev-the-man-behind-badoo-the-worlds-biggest-dating-app-f3qql99zs|title=Meet Andrey Andreev, the man behind Badoo, the world’s biggest dating app|last=Machell|first=Ben|date=2017-10-21|access-date=2017-10-23|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before dropping out to start his first company, he studied management at the local university, while working as a partner in an advertising and public relations company.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/05/features/sexual-network?page=1 How Badoo built a billion-pound social network... on sex] by David Rowan, Wired Magazine, 6 April 11. Accessed April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-90s, his family moved to Spain; Andreev himself relocated in 1995, but went back and forth between Spain and Russia.

Andreev has been based in central London since 2005 and lists cooking as one of his greatest passions. The sweet onion soup 'Andreï Style' at two-Michelin-starred [[L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon]] in [[Covent Garden|Covent Garden, London]] is named after him.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Virus ===
In 1995 Andreev started his first business in Russia - an online store that sold computers and computer accessories via Internet. He sold Virus in 1997 for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2018/03/12/russian-billionaire-cupid-andrey-andreev-most-popular-dating-app-badoo/#12b6daa47800|title=The Russian Billionaire Cupid Behind The Biggest Dating App In The World|last=Au-Yeung|first=Angel|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SpyLog===

In 1999, Andreev founded SpyLog, a web-tracking business which helped webmasters track visits to their sites, as well as track users' habits on the web. Although there were already existing services from Rambler and [[Mail.Ru|Mail.ru]], SpyLog grew quickly.

In 2002, Andreev started contextual advertising firm Begun, often described as an earlier version of [[AdWords|Google AdWords]]. A majority share of the company was purchased by Russian investment firm [[Finam Holdings|FINAM]] in 2004. Google tried to purchase Begun for $140 million in 2008. 

===Mamba===

Mamba was founded in 2004. Today it is the most popular dating site in Russia, with roughly 8 million users (or 13% of Russia’s Internet population) using its service. A majority share was sold in 2006 to FINAM and Mail.ru.

===Badoo===
{{Main|Badoo}}
Andreev launched [[Badoo]] in 2006, with the product quickly spreading in popularity throughout Europe and into Latin America. Today it is the largest social network in the world for meeting new people, with over 360 million registered users,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://team.badoo.com/|title=Discover Badoo|website=team.badoo.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; generating over $150 million per year and operating in 190 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-2e3f0042-75f6-4bd1-b4fe-9056540c65f8|title=The Dating Game|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in 2011, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' described Badoo as a 'mass phenomenon' in Brazil, Mexico, France, Spain and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sexual-network|title=How Badoo built a billion-pound social network... on sex|last=Rowan|first=David|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andreev has spoken of his unique management style and the company culture at Badoo. In an interview in October 2017, he told [[ShortList|Shortlist magazine]] that his philosophy in work is ‘to make people happy’, before discussing the food, perks and parties that are provided for Badoo’s staff. The company has since been named one of the Top 20 UK companies to work in, by Glassdoor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-best-companies-to-work-for-facebook-northern-gas-power-glassdoor-cmi-employers-a8007016.html|title=These are the best companies to work for in the UK|date=2017-10-18|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bumble ===
In 2014, Andreev connected with previous Tinder co-founder [[Whitney Wolfe]]. After he persuaded her to move back into the dating space, together they built [[Bumble (app)|Bumble]], the women-focused dating app. Speaking to ''[[The Guardian]]'', Wolfe named Andreev as her biggest mentor in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/jul/07/bumble-founder-whitney-wolfe-tinder-feminism-online-trolling|title=Whitney Wolfe: 'I'm worried we're alienating the good guys'|last=Featherstone|first=Emma|date=2017-07-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; she also admits that Andreev "took the chance on her when no one else would,” and that “without him, the bumble journey wouldn’t have been possible.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2018/03/12/russian-billionaire-cupid-andrey-andreev-most-popular-dating-app-badoo/#371fe1877800|title=The Russian Billionaire Cupid Behind The Biggest Dating App In The World|last=|first=|date=|website=forbes.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arkady Shalvovich "Badri" Patarkatsishvili''' ({{lang-ka|ბადრი პატარკაციშვილი}} 31 October 1955 – 12 February 2008) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] businessman who also became extensively involved in [[politics]]. He contested the [[Georgian presidential election, 2008|2008 Georgian presidential election]] and came third with 7.1% of the votes. Although his first name was Arkady, he was best known by the nickname "Badri".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.regnum.ru/news/fd-abroad/georgia/923062.html 
| title= В избирательных бюллетенях Бадри Патаркацишвили будет Аркадием (Грузия) | publisher= Regnum| date= 2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 1980s, until the time of his death, he was a flamboyant figure in business and was behind some of the most successful companies in today's Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1578596/Badri-Patarkatsishvili.html Daily Telegraph, Badri Patarkatsishvili, 14.02.2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  From humble origins, he became the wealthiest citizen in Georgia with an estimated wealth of $12bn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geotimes.ge/index.php?m=home&amp;newsid=3190/ ''The Richest Georgians of the World.

Patarkatsishvili suddenly died [[intestate]] in February 2008 sparking one of the largest estate battles in legal history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/10/oligarchs200910 Vanity Fair, The Widow and the Oligarchs, 01.10.09]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018 the government of Georgia officially accused the former president of Georgia [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] of ordering assassination of Badri Patarkatsishvili.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pog.gov.ge/geo/news?info_id=1827|title=პროკურატურის განცხადება ბადრი პატარკაციშვილის მკვლელობის მომზადების საქმეზე|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Government of Georgia|trans-title=Statement of Prosecutor's Office on Badri Patarkatsishvili's murder case|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Tbilisi]] to a [[History of the Jews in Georgia|Jewish family]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rochvarger|first=Michael|title=Badri Patarkatsishvili, future owner of Maariv?|url=http://www.haaretz.com/business/economy-finance/badri-patarkatsishvili-future-owner-of-maariv-1.222305|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Badri Patarkatsishvili: Billionaire businessman who failed to buy his way into the presidency of Georgia|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/badri-patarkatsishvili-billionaire-businessman-who-failed-to-buy-his-way-into-the-presidency-of-georgia-781980.html|accessdate=25 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patarkatsishvili became an active member of the [[Komsomol]], the youth wing of the Soviet Communist Party during the 1980s. He eventually became Komsomol leader at Maudi, a large textile operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2080888.ece The Times, Badri Patarkatsishvili Obituary 14.02.2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Badri became Deputy Director General of Gruzavtovazprom, a company that purchased and delivered cars and spare parts from [[AvtoVAZ]], which was at the time, the largest car manufacturer in the Soviet Union. It was during trips made to the AvtoVAZ plant that he first met [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] who was to become a close friend and business associate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2011/nov/02/boris-berezovsky-witness-statement-full] Berezovsky v Abramovich, Fourth Witness Statement of Boris Berezovsky, 31.05.2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Badri and Berezovsky founded LogoVaz with some of the senior executives of AvtoVAZ. LogoVaz developed software for AvtoVAZ, sold Soviet-made cars and serviced foreign cars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was established as a joint venture with Logo Systems, an Italian company, which at the time was seen as pioneering in commercial relationships between East and West. LogoVaz established an office in Georgia and Badri became Deputy Director General of the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2011/nov/02/boris-berezovsky-witness-statement-full] Berezovsky v Abramovich, Fourth Witness Statement of Boris Berezovsky, 31.05.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Moscow and involvement with ORT==
In 1992, Badri and his family moved to Moscow where he quickly became part of Berezovsky's increasingly influential political circle. LogoVaz had by this time become an extremely successful company and had made Badri a wealthy man. At the time, the Soviet Union was collapsing and there was a great deal of political uncertainty in the region. Badri, along with Berezvosky and other successful businessmen were supportive of [[Boris Yeltsin]] as he had liberalised trade with foreign countries, allowing their businesses to grow, however the wider economy was performing badly and there was growing support for [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]]'s reformed communist party.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Yeltsin]] Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1994, Berezovsky had secured control of [[Channel One Russia|ORT]], the largest TV station in Russia at the time, and he installed Badri as First Deputy General Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bany_of_the_words%5D=Badri%20Patarkatsishvili&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=2&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=33266&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=97bad3f3b642af89a107fad9eff47bf5#.U38pMFhdXVs The Jamestown Foundation, BADRI PATARKATSISHVILI: FROM RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN TO GEORGIAN PRESIDENTIAL CLAIMANT (part one)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Badri and Berezovsky then use the station's influence to assist [[Boris Yeltsin]] to victory in the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/2362/assessing_russias_democratic_presidential_election.html Allison, Graham T., and Matthew Lantz. "Assessing Russia's Democratic Presidential Election."] Harvard University (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 until mid 2000, Badri was a key figure at ORT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bany_of_the_words%5D=Badri%20Patarkatsishvili&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=2&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=33266&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=97bad3f3b642af89a107fad9eff47bf5#.U38pMFhdXVs The Jamestown Foundation, BADRI PATARKATSISHVILI: FROM RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN TO GEORGIAN PRESIDENTIAL CLAIMANT (part one)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Sibneft Privatisation==
In 1997, he was selected to oversee the privatization of the [[Sibneft]] oil company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2080888.ece The Times, Badri Patarkatsishvili Obituary 14.02.2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Sibneft was the youngest oil holding company in Russia at the time having been created hastily in early 1995 out of [[Rosneft]]. An unknown entity, Oil Finance Corporation (NFK), that had been created out of Menatep, a holding company started by [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], won the auction.&lt;ref&gt;Privatization in Transition Economies: The Ongoing Story, Edited by Ira W. Lieberman, Daniel J. Kop, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Berezovsky had an interest in the Menatep Group and for this reason, there was some speculation that the auction had been fixed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2080888.ece The Times, Badri Patarkatsishvili Obituary 14.02.2008]&lt;/ref&gt; It later emerged that the company had been sold for a fraction of the market value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=420&amp;issue_id=4338&amp;article_id=2372690/ '' Badri Patarkatsishvili: From Russian businessman to Georgian presidential claimant (Part One)'', Vladimir Socor, ''Jamestown Foundation'', Washington DC, 12-21-2007].Accessed 04-06-2008.  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Badri died, in 2012, the Sibneft privatisation was to become the subject of a high court legal battle between Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich and Berezovsky. According to ''[[The Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4272509.ece Roman Abramovich admits paying out billions on political favours]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Abramovich]] submitted a 53-page court defence that accused [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] and Badri Patarkatsishvili of demanding huge sums for helping him to rise from obscurity. Badri emerged as the key intermediary, passing messages between Abramovich and Berezovsky. Badri was offered $500 million by Roman Abramovich, the defence papers that were submitted admit, for protecting Roman in Russia's aluminium wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/Judgments/berezovsky-abramovich-summary.pdf Berezovsky v Abramovich, Gloster J] Action 2007, Folio 942&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV6 and Kommersant==
Following his success at ORT, in April 2001, Badri was appointed General Director of Russia's [[TV6 Russia|TV6]] channel, which, like [[Channel One Russia|ORT]], was partly owned by Berezovsky. Under his control, TV6 became notorious for its anti-Kremlin line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2080888.ece The Times, Badri Patarkatsishvili Obituary 14.02.2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, Berezovsky and Badri also purchased [[Kommersant]] the one of Russia's most influential political newspapers. In 2006, Berezovsky sold his controlling stake to Badri increasing Badri's holding to 100%. Badri then organised the sale of Kommersant in August 2006 to senior [[Gazprom]] executive [[Alisher Usmanov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://business-in-russia.com/headlineitem_nn_1_id_1049/ '' Kommersant newspaper sold out'', Alliance Media, Moscow, quoting RosBusinessConsulting, 09-03-2006].Accessed: 04-05-2008.  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=33267#.U4gkdZRdXVt BADRI PATARKATSISHVILI: FROM RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN TO GEORGIAN PRESIDENTIAL CLAIMANT (part two)] The James Town Foundation, 21 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political trouble in Russia==
By mid 1999, [[Boris Yeltsin]] began losing his grip on power and [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] began to play an important role in the hunt for his successor. He did this in order to counter the political aspirations of the Prime Minister [[Yevgeny Primakov]], who was seen as more of a statist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uh.edu/~pgregory/conf/Rutland.PDF Putin's Path to Power, Peter Rutland, (December 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; As Berezovsky lost favour with the Kremlin, investigations began into his business affairs which Berezovsky claimed to be politically motivated. This eventually led to an arrest warrant for Berezovsky being issued in April 1999 by the Prosecutor General, [[Yury Skuratov]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Wikipedia, Boris Berezovsky]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Badri had sought to distance himself from Berezovsky's political dealings his proximity to Berezovsky was such that he began to fear that he may also be arrested so in 2000 Badri left Moscow for his native Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bany_of_the_words%5D=Badri%20Patarkatsishvili&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=2&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=33266&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=97bad3f3b642af89a107fad9eff47bf5#.U38pMFhdXVs The Jamestown Foundation, BADRI PATARKATSISHVILI: FROM RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN TO GEORGIAN PRESIDENTIAL CLAIMANT (part one)]&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Vladimir Putin]] was elected in March 2000, Badri hoped that the situation for Berezovsky and himself in [[Russia]] would improve. He and Berezovsky had supported Putin in his election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Based on text of his taped conversation with Erekle Kodua [http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=850966 Full text in Russian] published in [[Kommersant]]&lt;/ref&gt; Badri later claimed that he had recommended Putin to [[Pavel Borodin]], then a senior member of [[Boris Yeltsin|President Boris Yeltsin]]'s Kremlin administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=851013 Difficulties of translation from Georgian], [[Kommersant]], February 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Berezovsky had also gotten Putin appointed as [[FSB (Russia)|Russian FSB]] director.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Berezovsky quickly fell out with the new president. On May 31, Berezovsky sharply attacked the constitutional reform proposed by Putin, which would give the Kremlin the right to dismiss elected governors. In an open letter to Putin published in [[Kommersant]] Berezovsky, then a [[Duma]] deputy, said that he would be obliged to vote against the president's legislative project, which was "directed toward changing the state's structure" and represented a "threat to Russia's territorial integrity and democracy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/4339.html##1 "Berezovsky's Letter Dominates News"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808053145/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/4339.html%23 |date=August 8, 2009 }} [[Moscow Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; Things came to ahead in August 2000 when Berezovsky used ORT to attack Putin for his handling of the sinking of the [[Kursk submarine]], blaming the death of 118 sailors on the Kremlin's reluctance to accept foreign help.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/sep2000/russ-s28.shtml "Russian President Putin tries to break Berezovsky's grip"] [[World Socialist Web Site]] 28 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; This began to put pressure also on to Badri, whose association with Berezovsky was well known and was at the time, controlling the ORT station.

In December 2000, [[Nikolay Glushkov]] a co-founder of AvtoVAZ and a close associate of Badri and Berezovsky was arrested as part of the Russian Prosecutor General's investigation in [[Aeroflot]], a company that Berezovsky had an interest in. Badri and Berezovsky believed the arrest to be politically motivated and part of the Kremlin's attempt to put pressure on their businesses. Glushkov suffered from a hereditary blood disease and had to receive special medical treatment in hospital. Badri and Berezovsky began negotiations with the Government for his release agreeing to give up their media interests and for Berezovsky to end his political ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/273211 Kommersant "Я бы отдал все, если бы отпустили Глушкова"] Badri Patarkatsishvili Interview, Kommersant "I'd give anything to see Glushkov released" 4.7.2001&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in June 2001, the Russian [[Prosecutor General of Russia|Prosecutor General's]] Office charged Badri with organizing an attempted escape from prison of Glushkov and issued an arrest warrant for him through Interpol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bany_of_the_words%5D=Badri%20Patarkatsishvili&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=2&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=33266&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=97bad3f3b642af89a107fad9eff47bf5#.U38pMFhdXVs The Jamestown Foundation, BADRI PATARKATSISHVILI: FROM RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN TO GEORGIAN PRESIDENTIAL CLAIMANT (part one)]&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing that he would not be given a fair trial, Badri refused to come in for questioning and, on July 4, 2001, he gave an interview to the ''Kommersant'' newspaper setting out his version of events in an attempt to clear his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/273211 Kommersant "Я бы отдал все, если бы отпустили Глушкова"] Badri Patarkatsishvili Interview, Kommersant "I'd give anything to see Glushkov released" 4.7.2001&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid prosecution in Russia, Badri moved to Tbilisi where he had been granted [[political asylum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/15/georgia.russia/  ''Obituary: Badri Patarkatsishvili'', Tom Parfitt, ''The Guardian'', London, 02-15-2008].Accessed: 04-05-2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further charges relating to the misappropriation of AvtoVaz were added in October 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1578596/Badri-Patarkatsishvili.html Obituary, Badri Patarkasishvili] Daily Telegraph, 14.02.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investment and philanthropy in Georgia==
Upon his return Badri began investing much of the vast wealth that he had accumulated in Russia into his native country. He had become personally wealthier than the entire state budget and so was able to invest in business ventures and charitable projects in a scale that had been previously unimaginable to the impoverished country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bany_of_the_words%5D=Badri%20Patarkatsishvili&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=2&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=33266&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=97bad3f3b642af89a107fad9eff47bf5#.U38pMFhdXVs The Jamestown Foundation, BADRI PATARKATSISHVILI: FROM RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN TO GEORGIAN PRESIDENTIAL CLAIMANT (part one)]&lt;/ref&gt; He bought the Tbilisi city football team, [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]], the [[Kulevi oil terminal]] and financed a new shopping centre in the capital and a holiday resort on the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1578596/Badri-Patarkatsishvili.html Obituary, Badri Patarkasishvili] Daily Telegraph, 14.02.2008&lt;/ref&gt; He also became the head of the federation of Georgian businessmen and head of the [[Georgian National Olympic Committee]], subsidized social programs and cultural activities, and on two occasions paid debts for the gas and electricity consumed by Tbilisi residents. He funded several charity projects including schools, amusement parks - even a monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1578596/Badri-Patarkatsishvili.html Daily Telegraph, Badri Patarkatsishvili, 14.02.2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In return for these paternal gifts, the then president [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] agreed to allow Badri the state's protection from charges against him in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bany_of_the_words%5D=Badri%20Patarkatsishvili&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=2&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=33266&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7&amp;cHash=97bad3f3b642af89a107fad9eff47bf5#.U38pMFhdXVs The Jamestown Foundation, BADRI PATARKATSISHVILI: FROM RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN TO GEORGIAN PRESIDENTIAL CLAIMANT (part one)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, he founded [[Imedi Media Holding]], the first independent broadcasting station in [[Georgia (Country)|Georgia]].

==Involvement in politics in Georgia==
During his early career, Badri had shown little interest in politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2080888.ece The Times, Badri Patarkatsishvili Obituary 14.02.2008]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the [[Rose Revolution]] began in 2003 and Badri could see that Eduard Shevardnadze was losing his grip on power, he used his wealth to support the new opposition candidate [[Mikheil Saakashvili]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1578596/Badri-Patarkatsishvili.html Daily Telegraph, Badri Patarkatsishvili, 14.02.2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between Badri and Saakashvili soon deteriorated however and they became bitter rivals. Badri claimed that this was due to the coverage given by Imedi to opposition parties, Saakasvili however claimed that Badri was attempting to use his wealth to gain control of business life in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1578596/Badri-Patarkatsishvili.html Daily Telegraph, Badri Patarkatsishvili, 14.02.2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Badri began financing opposition parties in late 2006 and early 2007 and a pro-Patarkatsishvili group in parliament soon emerged that developed into the [[Our Georgia - Free Democrats|Our Georgia]] party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=33267#.U4gkdZRdXVt BADRI PATARKATSISHVILI: FROM RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN TO GEORGIAN PRESIDENTIAL CLAIMANT (part two) The James Town Foundation, 21 December 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
In late 2007, he became embroiled in a political scandal after former defense minister [[Irakli Okruashvili]] on September 25, 2007, accused [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], the [[President of Georgia]], of planning Patarkatsishvili's assassination. Arrested on corruption charges, however, Okruashvili retracted his accusations against the president, winning release on bail of 10 million [[Georgian lari]] (about 6,250,000 USD). He also said that his earlier accusations levelled against Saakashvili were not true and were aimed at gaining political dividends for himself and Badri Patarkatsishvili and at discrediting the President of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=15975 Okruashvili May Be Freed on Bail after Pleading Guilty].

Associated Press (''[[International Herald Tribune]]''). October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, Okruashvili, said on Patarkatsishvili's Imedi TV - by then managed by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox TV]]'s parent [[News Corporation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav032608b.shtml/ ''News Corporation: A farewell to Georgia?'',  Giorgi Lomsadze, ''Eurasia Insight'', Eurasianet.org, New York, NY, 03-26-08].Accessed: 04-06-2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  - that he had been forced into retracting his accusations against Saakashvili by pressure that he endured in prison. Down the line from Munich, he said: "All of those accusations, all of those facts that I brought against Saakashvili, everything I said about him is the plain truth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/11/129F6DA9-B5B6-400D-9160-EA0E53BAA35F.html/ ''Firebrand Okruashvili’s Televised Return Boosts Opposition'', Radio Free Europe, 11-06-2007].Accessed: 04-06-2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Badri lost favour with Saakashvili's government In 2007, numerous allegations of corruption were made against him. He was [[#Interest in sports|impeached]] as president of the Georgian National Olympic Committee, and also quit as a president of the Georgian Business Federation. Tbilisi-based Rustavi 2 TV, a channel controlled by Saakashvili's government, linked his name with several notorious murders in Russia and Georgia, including the assassination of [[Vlad Listyev]].

On October 29, 2007, Badri publicly announced his plans to finance ten opposition parties' campaign aimed at holding early parliamentary elections in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16119 Patarkatsishvili Pledges to Finance Protest Rallies]. Civil Georgia. 2007-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, 2007, he addressed a large [[2007 Georgian demonstrations|anti-government rally]] held in downtown Tbilisi and pledged to further support it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16169 Patarkatsishvili Addresses Protest Rally]. Civil Georgia. 2007-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; He left Georgia for [[London]] shortly afterwards. After the demonstration turned violent, following police attacks, on November 7, 2007, Georgia's Chief Prosecutor's Office announced that he was suspected of conspiracy to overthrow the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16273 Patarkatsishvili Suspected of "Coup Plotting"]. Civil Georgia. November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he said he would run in the January 5, 2008, [[Georgian presidential election, 2008|snap presidential elections]] under the slogan "Georgia without Saakashvili is Georgia without Terror."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16288 Patarkatsishvili Says he will Run for Presidency].

Civil Georgia. 2007-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 24 and 25, 2007, the prosecutor-general's office of Georgia released a series of audio and video recordings of the two separate meetings of the high-ranking Georgian Interior Ministry official Erekle Kodua with Patarkatsishvili and the head of his pre-election campaign Valeri Gelbakhiani. According to the government, Patarkatsishvili was trying to bribe Kodua to take part in what the Georgian officials described as an attempted coup d'état on January 6, 2008, the next of the scheduled presidential elections. The plan included to stage a mass manifestation against the government and to "neutralize" the Interior Minister [[Vano Merabishvili]]. Later independent journalist Vakhtang Komakidze produced what he said was the full transcript of the recorded conversation which showed that Patarkatsishvili was advising against violence and the extracts released had been doctored&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgiamediacentre.com/content/one_reasons_why_vakhtang_komakhidze_fled_georgia One of the reasons Vakhtang Komakidze fled Georgia] Georgian International Media Centre 2010-05-05&lt;/ref&gt; The accusations forced Patarkatsishvili onto the defensive. He confirmed that he met with Kodua in London, but denied that the bribe was in connection to an alleged coup plot and claimed instead that his intention was to uncover what he said were official plans to rig the election. He also confirmed that he offered Kodua "a huge amount of money" in exchange for defecting from the authorities allegedly to avert a possible use of force by the government against the planned January rallies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16653 Patarkatsishvili Ally a Suspect in Coup Plot].

''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' reported the following information. Patarkatsishvili, living in London, was approached by members of the Saakashvili government demanding that he sell his controlling share in the dissident [[Imedi]] TV network. Initially, Patarkatsishvili refused, but was then offered an unprecedented deal: exchanging ownership of Imedi for ownership of the entire Georgian railroad system.  Being a businessman, Patarkatsishvili reportedly agreed; however, when the Saakashvili side sent him the contract, there was a new clause, which required Badri to invest $2,000,000,000 in the "improvement" of the railroad property. He refused, but died shortly after. Novaya Gazeta's source is one of the lawyers from the legal side of this deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Estate Battle==
Following Badri's death, several of his closest business associates made attempts to fraudulently claim his business assets from his family members, who were (Badri having died without leaving an valid will), under Georgian law, entitled to his residual estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/10/oligarchs200910 The Widow and the Oligarchs] Susanne Andrews, Vanity Fair, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Badri died, Joseph Kay, the stepson of Patarkatsishvili's aunt and someone who had assisted Badri with his business affairs, along with the American lawyer, Emmanuel Zeltser, attempted to take control of [[Imedi Media Holding|Imedi]], [[Mtatsminda Park]] and the [[Rustavi Steel|Rustavi Metallurgical Plant]] in Georgia, as well as other assets belonging to [[Inna Gudavadze]] and the Patarkatsishvili family, including a large development on [[Fisher Island]] in Florida, by claiming to be in possession of Patarkatsishvili's last [[will and testament]] that appointed Kay as executor of the estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/10/oligarchs200910 Susanne Andrews, Vanity Fair, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; These documents were later declared to be forgeries in the UK High Court.&lt;ref&gt;[Gudavadze v Kay [2012] EWHC 1683 (Ch)]&lt;/ref&gt; Kay's case was comprehensively dismissed by Mr Justice Dudley in the Supreme Court of Gibraltar in February 2010.

Another claim over the estate was launched in 2012 by [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]. Berezovsky claimed that half of Badri's assets belong to him under a handshake agreement that the two men made in 1995 to split all their commercial interests equally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/article3293746.ece The odd couple and their extraordinary labyrinth of wealth] The Times, 21 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the judgement of [[Elizabeth Gloster|Gloster J]] in [[Berezovsky v Abramovich]] 2012 that gave a damming report of Berezovsky's character, Berezovsky quickly settled his case against the Patarkatsishvili family. The details of the settlement however remained confidential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b7e63bae-fdb9-11e1-9901-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3394SjmPz Berezovsky settles Patarkatsishvili lawsuit] Financial Times, 13 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Inna Gudavadze, her two daughters, Iya Patarkatsishvili and Liana Zhmotova, and Badri's mother Natela Patarkatsishvili brought a $1.8bn action against another of Badri's business associates, [[Vasily Anisimov]]. The family claimed that they had a part-entitlement to the 20% share formerly held by Anisimov in mining company [[Metalloinvest]]. The case was settled in March 2014 before it came to court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9f667670-ab78-11e3-aad9-00144feab7de.html#axzz3394SjmPz Patarkatsishvili family reaches deal over Metalloinvest stake] Financial Times, 14 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Danske Dandridge''' (November 19, 1854 – June 3, 1914) was a Danish-born American poet, historian, and garden writer. Along with her contemporaries, [[Waitman T. Barbe]] and [[Thomas Dunn English]], Dandridge was considered a major poet of late 19th-century [[West Virginia]].{{sfn|Rice|2010|p=}}

By marriage, Dandridge secured not only the sympathy, encouragement and criticism she needed, but alliteration of name. She had scribbled verses since she was a child of eight. But the morbid, sensitive child had not attempted ambitious verse, nor did she as a grown woman till she had been married some years.{{sfn|Moulton|1889|p=180}} Her works were ''Joy and Other Poems'', ''Twilight in the Woods'', ''The Lover in the Woods'', ''Rose Brake'', and miscellaneous contributions to the periodicals.{{sfn|Rutherford|1894|p=680}}

==Early years and education==
Caroline "Danske" Bedinger was born on November 19, 1854 in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. Her father was Hon. Henry Bedinger, was the first United States  ambassador to Denmark,{{sfn|Flora||Vogel|2006|p=94}} having been appointment by [[President Buchanan]]. He wrote poems for ''The Southern Literary Messenger''.{{sfn|Moulton|1889|p=180}}  Her mother was Caroline Lawrence Bedinger (from [[Rhode Island]]),{{sfn|Rutherford|1894|p=680}} was a granddaughter of Eliza Southgate Bowne (1797–1802), whose “Letters of a Young Girl Eighty Years Ago” gave a picture of New England society in the early years of the 19th-century. 
[[File:Morgan-Bedinger-Dandridge-House rosebrake.jpg|thumb|Rose Brake]]
She was brought to the United States in 1857, living in [[Flushing, New York]]. 
Mr. Bedinger's death took place shortly before the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], and his widow returned with her three children – of whom Danske was the youngest — to the homestead at [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia|Shepherdstown, Virginia]].
In Shepherdstown, her mother purchased an estate called "Poplar Grove", renaming it "[[Morgan-Bedinger-Dandridge House|Rose Brake]]" and here the family cared for wounded soldiers during the [[Battle of Antietam]]. 
She did not survive her husband many years; and the orphans were taken into the care of their grandfather, Hon. J. W. Lawrence, at [[Flushing, Long Island]].{{sfn|Hills|Luce|1891|p=255}} 

Dandridge was frail in health and nervous in temperament.{{sfn|Moulton|1889|p=180}} Early in life, she developed the practice of singing, and, later, the study of the composition of verse. She wrote in rhyme from childhood, but refrained from publishing until her work was no longer immature.{{sfn|Hills|Luce|1891|p=255}} 

==Career==
Danske married Adam Stephen Dandridge, Jr.{{sfn|Flora||Vogel|2006|p=94}} on May 3, 1877,{{sfn|Hills|Luce|1891|p=255}} and they moved back to Shepherdstown. He owned an agricultural implements and machinery shop, and like his wife, was a member of a prominent [[Virginia]] family.{{sfn|MacDonald|2006|p=197}} The Dandridges went on to have three children. Her husband was not rich, and they lived upon a farm. Thus, Dandridge did not have access to books or opportunities for literary culture. At times, she did not have a dictionary, and she was burdened with ill health.{{sfn|Rutherford|1894|p=680}}

She began writing poetry again in 1883 and had her first poem, "Chrysanthemum", published in ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]'' in 1885.{{sfn|Rutherford|1894|p=680}} She renamed her husband's Shepherdstown family home "Rose Brake" at about the same time. In the following summer, she wrote “The Lover in the Woods” for ''[[Lippincott's Monthly Magazine]]''; and “Twilight in the Woods” for the ''New York Independent''. To the latter journal, she was a constant and favorite contributor, writing also for various magazines and other periodicals. Her first volume, entitled ''Joy, and Other Poems'' ([[G.P. Putnam's Sons]], 1888), a collection of fugitive verses, made a distinct impression. The critics united in praise of the delicate, aerial music, the sensitive sympathy with nature, the luminous and capricious fancy, and the bright and healthful tone of these poems. Dandridge never overstrained the clear light voice that is hers; not even when she touches tragic notes, as in the finely imaginative ode, “The Dead Moon,” or in the more directly human theme of the terse and significant lyric, “Fate.” Her comprehension and utterance of the realities of life appeared delicately remote.{{sfn|Hills|Luce|1891|p=256}} The volume was also recalled as a sweet, simple first venture. None of the poems were profound or great; but many were striking for thought and expression, and they all had a delicate freshness.{{sfn|Moulton|1889|p=180}} 

The second volume of poems by Dandridge was published in 1890. It took its title, “Rose Brake,” from the name of her estate in Shepherdstown. One reviewer stated that the volume fully confirmed the favorable impression already made by her first publication. In the poem "Fancy", she was said to have excelled; while in the expression of sentiment less imaginative, her work was good, but not surpassing.{{sfn|Wanamaker|1891|p=271}} Yet another reviewer stated that Dandridge's first volume, ''Joy and Other Poems'', raised hopes which her second volume, ''Rose Brake'', did not satisfy. There was no lack of metrical skill, or appreciation of nature and subtle moods, but there was lacking the deeper interpretation of life which poetry demands.{{sfn|Wanamaker|1891|p=281}}

During the period of 1891 till 1904, she turned to writing garden articles, more than 200 of them, for ''Forest and Stream'', ''Garden and Forest'', ''Gardening'', among other publications.{{sfn|Flora||Vogel|2006|p=94}} After that, she devoted her time to writing works of early American history.{{sfn|Flora||Vogel|2006|p=94}} 

==Personal life==
Dandridge created a "remarkable" garden at Rose Brake,{{sfn|Flora||Vogel|2006|p=94}} assisted by [[Afro-American]] gardeners Tom and Charity Devonshire.{{sfn|MacDonald|2006|p=197}} Here, she spent time in her [[hammock]].{{sfn|Hills|Luce|1891|p=256}} She had three children, but the death of two of them led her to be withdrawn. There was speculation that Dandridge's death at home in Shepherdstown, on June 3, 1914, was a [[suicide]], though it was refuted by the family.{{sfn|Flora||Vogel|2006|p=94}}

[[File:211 Fort Street, detroit.jpg|thumb|Metro area business leaders belong to the Detroit Economic Club, headquartered at [[211 West Fort Street]].]]

The '''Detroit Economic Club''', headquartered at [[211 West Fort Street]] in downtown [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], was formed in 1934 as a platform for the discussion and debate of important business, government and social issues. It is known internationally as a top speaking forum for prominent business, academic, and government officials, who address members and their guests at the Club's 35-meeting season. With more than 3,500 members, the DEC is a forum for vital issues. The DEC claims to have hosted every sitting U.S. President since [[Richard Nixon]] and is ranked among the top speaking platforms in the world.  The DEC is one of the most valued podiums for CEO's in the world and one of the top five executive speaking forums in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econclub.org/ Detroit Economic Club]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Detroit Economic Club was founded in 1934 by Allen Crow. The objective of the Club was and still is: to promote an interest in, and to enlighten its members on important governmental, economic and societal issues. The growth in the Club was rapid in the first year, with 275 men joining. Specifically "men" because women were not admitted until 1973.  That was the year after Michigan ratified the Equal Rights Amendment.  Within five years of the inception, the Club's membership had grown to 1,100 and post World War II the membership was approaching 2,000. The logo of the Club is an Aladdin's Lamp, which Crow selected it because it was the Greek symbol for enlightenment. That is what the Club is all about. Born out of the Depression, the Club tends to succeed, even when the economy is not. Founder, Allen Crow, had a big idea: "Maybe if you gathered a lot of smart people in one room, on a regular basis, they could figure the way out (The Great Depression)."

== Operation ==
The main activity of the Club is usually is in the form of a breakfast or lunch/business meeting setting. The Club presents, on average, 35 meetings per year.  Where the speaker(s) take the podium/stage and address whatever their topic is at that time. Speakers usually speak for about 20–30 minutes and there is reserved times for networking and questions. Traditionally, the club would meet on Monday's. You might wonder why the Club met on a Monday. The history goes back before commercial air travel and the meetings were scheduled by Allen Crow on Monday's so that the speakers could travel to Detroit by train over the weekend and this would conserve their weekly business time. Originally, annual dues were $5.00 and tickets were $1.50. Over the years the dues have naturally increased to keep pace with inflation and growth. Now the Club has five categories of memberships ranging from Young Leader dues at $75.00 to Gold Membership at $500.00. The Club's meeting place was and still are some of the same venues from the early stages of the Club such as: the Book Cadillac Hotel (now the Westin Book Cadillac), and later a number of the Club's meetings took place at Cobo Hall, and is still a principal location.

== Speakers ==
How The Club obtain speakers, is often asked. In early days, they did pay, but this costly practice was eliminated. Now, the speakers come because they welcome the opportunity to address the Club's prestigious forum, and for the extensive outreach they know their message will receive. In addition to the newspaper coverage that the speakers receive, a number of radio stations use to broadcast the meetings and was carried to about 400,000 Metro-Detroit area homes. Now, there is still the newspaper and radio coverage, but by technology advancing the way that it has, the Club sometimes have a live-stream for viewers at home or members on the road. The Club has always pushed to obtain some of the region's most prominent and well spoken leaders around the globe. To be fair, The Club has hosted a meeting with every President of the United States since former President Nixon.  The first woman speaker at the DEC was Catherine Curtis on November 1, 1937 and she spoke on "The Housewife as Capitalist." The first Black speaker was Lester Granger, President of  the National Urban League on January 19, 1948. In addition to those groundbreaking speakers, there has been a number of international level leaders as well to grace the Club with their wisdom and words of enlightenment such as: Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Antoly Dobrynin, Bruno Kreisky when he was the Australian Chancellor, Ambassador of the Republic of Cuba to the U.S. Jose Ramon Cabanas Rodriguez, and countless others.

== Presidents (DEC Presidents) ==
The President of the Club, historically was the chief operating officer as well as the president. Nowadays, those titles and tasks are handled by two separate individuals with the same goal in mind. Since the first President and Founder, Allen B. Crow, there has been eight other fantastic Leaders of this great Club. Lester Skene Bork, Walker Lee Cisler, (who was also one of the founding members of the National Academy of Engineering) Russel A. Swaney, Theodore H. Mecke, Jr., Wesley R. Johnson, (also served as President of Woodall Industries and Libbey Owens Ford Plastics before retiring and serving the DEC) Gerald E. Warren, William R. Halling, (served on the Board of Directors for: Compuware and KPMG, LLP and also the third longest presidential term for the Club) and current President, Elizabeth "Beth" Chappell, who has been serving the Club for 15 years, which is the second longest term after the Founder, Allen B. Crow. Mrs. Chappell has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Detroit Economic Club since 2002. Previously, she served as Executive Vice President, Corporate Communications &amp; Investor Relations for Compuware Corporation. From 1995 to 2000, Mrs. Chappell was President and Chief Executive Officer of a consulting firm she founded, The Chappell Group, Inc. For 16 years, Mrs. Chappell held executive positions at AT&amp;T. From 1999 to 2009. Recently, Beth has announced that she will be moving forward with her career and starting a company that she co-founded with her son-in-law, but insist that members and supporters know that she will always be a part of the Club, as she has been for 27 years.

== Young Leaders Program ==
The Young Leader Program has been growing steadily over the years since its launch in 2007. The Young Leader members are made up of over 1,200 young professionals in out of the Metro-Detroit area. All YL members are under the age of 40 years, which is the only requirement to join the Young Leaders program. Not only do are the YL members allowed to regular DEC meetings, but also have their very own Young Leader Series meetings of their own. In addition to hosting an annual Young Leader Conference. The Young Leader program is continuously growing with more young professionals who are invested into the economic and political future of the great City of Detroit.

== Career Readiness Academy (CRA) ==
The Detroit Economic Club’s Career Readiness Academy is a 6-month program that brings high school and Young Leader (YLs) members together for monthly meetings that aim to teach skills that will help the students effectively navigate their high school journey to find greater success in the working world. The same team of YLs and students meet each month which not only provides the opportunity for more personalized attention but also forges important mentor-mentee relationships. The monthly sessions are broke up into 6 groups, specifically to educate these students on career exploration, economic realities, college, and a number of other amazing tools that they will need as they work their way into the career path of their liking.

==National Summit==
In June 2009, the DEC assembled some of America’s top business, government and academic leaders, among others, in debate and dialogue on four issues of vital importance to America’s future in a global economy - Technology, Energy, Environment, and Manufacturing. The goal of The National Summit was to bring attention to actions that would improve America’s ability to compete in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalsummit.org/overview/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206204604/http://nationalsummit.org/overview |archivedate=2009-02-06 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louisville, Kentucky skyline - April 2011.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Louisville skyline]]
'''Downtown Louisville''' is the largest [[central business district]] in the Commonwealth of [[Kentucky]] and the urban hub of the [[Louisville, Kentucky]] Metropolitan Area.  Its boundaries are the [[Ohio River]] to the north, Hancock Street to the east, York and Jacob Streets to the south, and 9th Street to the west. As of 2015, the population of Downtown Louisville was 4,700, although this does not include directly surrounding areas such as Old Louisville, Butchertown, NuLu,and Phoenix Hill.

The five main areas of the [[Central Business District]] consist of:
*'''[[West Main District, Louisville|West Main District]]''' (west of 2nd St., north of Market St., east of 9th St., and south of the [[Ohio River]])
*'''East Main District''' (east of 2nd St., north of Market St., west of Hancock St., and south of the Ohio River; contains the [[Whiskey Row, Louisville|Whiskey Row Historic District]])
*'''Medical Center''' (east of 2nd St., south of Market St., west of Hancock St., and north of Jacob St.)
*'''Fourth St. District''' (south of Market St., west of 2nd St., north of York St., and east of 5th St.)
*'''Civic Center''' (south of Market St., west of 5th St., north of York St., and east of 9th St.)
The [[tallest buildings by states|tallest buildings]] in Kentucky are located in Downtown Louisville and include [[400 West Market]] designed by [[John Burgee]], [[National City Tower]] designed by [[Wallace Harrison|Harrison]] &amp; [[Max Abramovitz|Abramovitz]], [[PNC Plaza]] designed by [[Welton Becket]], and the [[Humana Building]] designed by [[Michael Graves]]. Of the 16 buildings in Kentucky over {{convert|300|ft|m}}, 12 are in Downtown Louisville. In addition, it is the center of local and regional government.

[[File:AEGON Center.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[400 West Market]]]]

A glassed-in [[skywalk]] called the Louie Link stretches six city blocks and links together the [[Kentucky International Convention Center]] (KICC), [[Fourth Street Live!]], three hotels ([[Galt House|Galt House Hotel &amp; Suites]], [[Marriott International|Marriott]] and [[Hyatt|Hyatt Regency]]), and 2,300 hotel rooms.  In 2010 it was extended from the [[Galt House]] to the new $16 million Skywalk Garage, an eight-level, 860-space parking facility on Third Street, and a second skywalk connects from the garage across Third Street to the new [[KFC Yum! Center]].

[[File:Levy building louisville.jpg|thumb|200px|The Richardsonian Romanesque Levy Building, built in 1893, is an example of Downtown Louisville's classic architecture, as well as its revitalization; the upper four floors have been converted to 23 loft condominiums.]]
Downtown Louisville is the oldest part of the city of Louisville, whose initial development was closely tied to the [[Ohio River]]. The largest early fort, [[Fort Nelson (Kentucky)|Fort Nelson]], was built in 1781 near what is today the corner of 7th and Main streets. Many early residents lived nearby after moving out of the forts by the mid-1780s, although little remains of the earliest (mostly wood) structures.

Early plans of the city, such as William Pope's original plan in 1783, show a simple grid on an east/west axis along the river.  The earliest streets, Main, Market and Jefferson retain their original names from the plan, while the smaller Green Street is now known as Liberty (it was renamed after Green Street acquired a seedy reputation due to its many burlesque theaters).  Main Street was the city's initial commercial hub for nearly a century.

By 1830 Louisville passed [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] as Kentucky's largest city, with a population over 10,000.  The [[steamboat]] era saw the opening of the [[Louisville and Portland Canal]] just west of downtown, and local commerce picked up further with the founding of banks and manufacturing.  Most of Louisville's population was packed into downtown, which by this time stretched as far south as Prather Street (later renamed Broadway).  Many still-remaining buildings reveal what the area was like at this time, with narrow, two to four-story buildings packing the streets.

The area and the city continued to grow during the railroad era.  However, the increased mobility of early [[tram|trolleys]], as well as the sheer number and diversity of people moving to Louisville, saw a shift in focus as areas like [[Phoenix Hill]], [[Russell, Louisville|Russell]] and what is now [[Old Louisville]] began to be built on the edges of downtown, particularly after the city [[annexation|annexed]] those areas in 1868. Railroads lead to a diminished role for the river in transportation, further reducing the importance of downtown in favor of areas on what was then the edge of the city, along rail lines.

In 1886, the first skyscraper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aia-ckc.org/download.php?tn=mod_downloads_1&amp;pk=fileid&amp;id=138 |title=History of Louisville Architectural Firms |author=Wiser, Stephen A. |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208072024/http://www.aia-ckc.org/download.php?tn=mod_downloads_1&amp;pk=fileid&amp;id=138 |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Kenyon Building, was completed on Fifth Street, followed in 1890 by the ten-story [[Columbia Building (Louisville, Kentucky)|Columbia Building]]. The development of three large suburban parks and the electrified [[streetcar]] lead to the first true movement to the suburbs at this time.  Some of downtown's business and industry followed people toward these areas.  But by the 1920s the commercial center of Louisville was still nearby, at 4th and Broadway, dubbed the "magic corner" by the ''[[Louisville Herald-Post|Herald-Post]]''.  The riverfront area of downtown was still being actively improved, such as with the building of what is now [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge]] across the Ohio at Second Street in 1929.

After [[World War II]], suburbanization increased and downtown began to decline as interstate highways further reduced the importance of its central location.  Since the 1970s, downtown has been the subject of both [[urban renewal]] and [[historic preservation]] efforts. While many new buildings have been built, it has sometimes been at the expense of older landmarks, such as the [[Tyler Block]].

Many buildings sat totally or mostly vacant at this time, and some became dilapidated to the point where they burned down or had to be razed. Many riverfront industrial sites were abandoned or saw limited use, many were eventually redeveloped into [[Louisville Waterfront Park]]. Other issues in the 1970s through the early 1990s included a former theater district on Jefferson Street that had become dubbed the "porno district". The businesses there were seen by the city as an eyesore since they were so close to the convention center, and most were demolished or burned down by the late 1990s. A few adult book stores and bars remained in the general area as of 2007.

From the late 1970s to early 1990s, nine new high rises over {{convert|200|ft|m}} in height were built in downtown. Unlike the city's previous tallest buildings, which were all set along the Broadway corridor, these new buildings were set closer to the riverfront along Main and Market Streets.

Since 2000, downtown has seen another major growth spurt, although this one not only includes new high rises, but also a large scale return of large scale residential and retail back to the city center. The completion of [[Louisville Slugger Field]] along with a mass expansion of the city's
[[Louisville Waterfront Park|Waterfront Park]], both completed in 1998, sparked new development along the eastern edge of downtown, with entire abandoned blocks rebuilt with new condominium units and shops. Also, new to Louisville is the 22,000-seat [[KFC Yum! Center]] at Second and Main Streets which was completed in 2010.

==Residential==
[[File:Pendennis club c1906.jpg|thumb|Example of an early downtown mansion, this Walnut Street mansion was built by the Belknap family and used as the first clubhouse of the [[Pendennis Club]] before being razed]]
Early residences outside of the forts, still mostly wood structures, were built along the modern street grid on early lots sold to settlers, but have all been demolished over time. What became the almost entirely office and parking-lot dominated downtown still had many solidly single family residential blocks on its fringes up until the early 20th century. Streets near Broadway, such as Chestnut, were lined with large mansions of the owners of businesses on Main and Market streets.
[[File:Louemaindev.jpg|thumb|left|New development on East Main Street]]
Though these houses were built of brick and other longer-lasting materials, none remained single family homes by the 21st century, although some had been converted for other uses, such as office space. The [[Ronald-Brennan House|Brennan House]] at 631 S. Fifth, which is operated as a historic property with daily tours, shows a glimpse of Downtown Louisville's residential past. A structure at 432 South Fifth Street is the only example of a pre-Civil War residence remaining Downtown; built in 1829 it has been converted to commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;''Louisville Guide'' (2004), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 20th century, downtown Louisville had acquired a reputation as a place to work and visit during the week but which shuts down evenings and weekends. The first changes to this were the conversion of old warehouse and factory space to loft apartments in the late 1980s. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, new developments of luxury condominiums such as the 22-story ''Waterfront Park Place'', and the $30 million project ''Fleur de Lis on Main'', indicate increasing residential interest in Downtown Louisville. On September 9, 2013, Mayor Greg Fischer joined groundbreaking ceremonies for the second phase of ''RiverPark Place'',  a marina apartment/condominium development covering 40 acres along River Road,  with a walkway west to  [[Louisville Waterfront Park|Waterfront Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.louisvilleky.gov/economicdevelopment/News/2013/OfficialsBreakGroundforExpandedRiverParkPlace.htm |title= Officials Break Ground for Expanded River Park Place – Louisville.gov |date= September 9, 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130924222717/http://www.louisvilleky.gov/economicdevelopment/News/2013/OfficialsBreakGroundforExpandedRiverParkPlace.htm |archivedate= September 24, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the [[Kentucky Towers]] was the largest residential building in Downtown Louisville,&lt;ref name="insiders"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nold|first1=Chip|last2=Bahr|first2=Bob|title=Insiders' Guide to Louisville, Kentucky &amp; Southern Indiana, 2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LEOE3_1PUgwC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=%22kentucky+towers%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kentucky%20towers%22&amp;f=false|year=1997|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-1-57380-043-3|page=278|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015, just south of downtown, [[The 800 Apartments]] started undergoing a more than $10 million modernization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2015/06/19/800-apartments.html |title= Village Green CEO: 800 Apartments 'will be the best apartment building in Louisville' |work=Louisville Business First |date=June 19, 2015 |accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Downtown Louisville became Jefferson County's tenth [[Multiple Listing Service]] zone.
[[File:Loulibertygreens.jpg|thumb|right|Liberty Greens will contain over 600 [[mixed-income housing]] units]]
Housing units available downtown were expected to double between 2005 and 2010, from 1,800 to nearly 4,000, after increasing by only 900 units from 1985 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=October 1, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001202622/http://www.louisvilleky.gov/DowntownDevelopment/News/2006/DowntownActivity.htm |title=LouisvilleKy.gov - 2006 - Louisville's Downtown Alive with Development |publisher=louisvilleky.gov |date=October 1, 2006 |accessdate=December 6, 2011|url=http://www.louisvilleky.gov/DowntownDevelopment/News/2006/DowntownActivity.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is both a result of new condominium construction and efforts to convert existing buildings into mixed usage, such as the $20 million redevelopment of the historic eight-story ''Henry Clay'' building at Third and Chestnut streets into a mix of residential, restaurant, retail and event space. The redevelopment also includes property that extends east to Fourth Street, which will become a public piazza, and the historic ''Wright-Taylor'' building, a two-story, {{convert|13500|sqft|m2|sing=on}} structure that faces Fourth Street and is located behind the Henry Clay, and is now an upscale restaurant that occupies the entire Wright-Taylor building.

==Plans==
Projects in the works include the construction of a wharf along the [[Riverwalk Trail]], and the [[Ohio River Bridges Project]], involving the reconstruction of [[Kennedy Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]] (the intersection of [[Interstate 65|I-65]], [[Interstate 64|I-64]] and [[Interstate 71|I-71]]) along with the addition of a new bridge for northbound I-65 traffic. One recently completed project was the conversion of the former [[Big Four Bridge|Big Four railroad bridge]] into a pedestrian and bicycle only bridge, which opened on the Kentucky side in 2013 and the Indiana side in 2014.

On August 19, 2007, city leaders and the [[Cordish Company]], developers of [[4th Street Live!]], announced ''Center City'', a $442  million, multi-year plan to develop {{convert|23|acre|m2}}, bounded by Second, Third and Liberty streets and Muhammad Ali Boulevard, that will include new housing, restaurants, a cinema and a boutique hotel. An estimated {{convert|500000|sqft|m2}} of floor space being created, including a 15-story structure. As the plan would require $130 million in local and state tax rebates for Cordish, it requires approval from the [[Louisville Metro Council]] and [[Kentucky General Assembly]]. There is no official start time for the project, as financing is still being secured by the Cordish Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More in store for downtown |publisher=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=August 19, 2007 |author=Davis, Alex |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/1724595761.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+19%2C+2007&amp;author=&amp;pub=Courier+-+Journal&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=More+in+store+for+downtown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also announced in 2007, the glass and steel $50 million shopping and office complex ''Iron Quarter'' was to be constructed within the [[Whiskey Row, Louisville|Whiskey Row Historic District]], but the project was delayed and eventually set aside when property owner Todd Blue made an agreement with the city of Louisville in January 2011 to demolish the seven original buildings.  In May 2011, after all seven buildings had been landmarked, a new agreement was made with the city to save five of the seven buildings by donating one and selling the other four, with the remaining two to be demolished.  Facades of all seven buildings are to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisvilleky.gov/Mayor/News/2011/5-9-11+whsikey+row+saved.htm |title=Fischer Announces Plans to Preserve Historic Whiskey Row |publisher=LouisvilleKY.gov |date=May 9, 2011 |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jerusalem triangle.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Aerial view of Jerusalem's Downtown Triangle.]]
The '''Downtown Triangle''' ({{lang-he|המשולש}}, ''Ha-Meshulash'', lit. "The Triangle") is a central commercial and entertainment district in [[West Jerusalem|Western]] [[Jerusalem]]. Measuring {{convert|29000|sqm}},&lt;ref name=jerusalem&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jerusalem.com/articles/jerusalem/the_jerusalem_triangle-a4166|title=The Jerusalem Triangle|publisher=Jerusalem.com|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the area is bounded by [[Jaffa Road]] on the north, [[King George Street (Jerusalem)|King George Street]] on the west, and [[Ben Yehuda Street (Jerusalem)|Ben Yehuda Street]] on the southeast. Its [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] are the intersections of Jaffa Road and King George Street, King George and Ben Yehuda Streets, and Ben Yehuda Street and Jaffa Road (the latter known as [[Zion Square]]).

From the mid-1940s through the 1960s, the Triangle was the commercial and cultural heart of Jerusalem, with many upscale shops and restaurants operated by [[German-Jewish]] immigrant businessmen that appealed to an affluent clientele. Following the [[reunification of Jerusalem]] in 1967 and the expansion of the city away from the downtown core, the commercial viability of the Triangle declined. The area was revitalized by the conversion of Ben Yehuda Street and the interior streets of the Triangle to an [[pedestrian zone|open-air pedestrian mall]] in 1982. Over the next two decades, outdoor cafes and souvenir shops moved in, cementing the reputation of the Triangle as a popular shopping and entertainment venue for tourists and young Israelis.

==History==
[[File:Ixim 1924.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Intersection of [[King George Street (Jerusalem)|King George Street]] (foreground), [[Straus Street]] (background), and [[Jaffa Road]] (right and left), 1924.]]
Before the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandatory government]] took over in 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]. With an eye to the continuing development of new neighborhoods outside the [[Walls of Jerusalem|Old City Walls]], the British drew up a master [[Urban planning|town plan]] that called for the establishment of two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the [[Mamilla]] area, which was closer to the Old City. However, the Mamilla development did not garner as much interest as the Triangle.&lt;ref name=kark&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzOAxmHDzHUC&amp;pg=PA153 |title=Jerusalem and Its Environs: Quarters, Neighborhoods, Villages, 1800–1948|first1=Ruth|last1=Kark|first2=Michal|last2=Oren-Nordheim |publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2001|isbn=0814329098|pages=153–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land used for the Downtown Triangle had been purchased by the [[Jewish Colonization Association]] from the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox Patriarchate]],&lt;ref name=wager&gt;{{cite book |last=Wager|first=Eliyahu|year=1988|title=Illustrated Guide To Jerusalem|publisher=Jerusalem Publishing House|isbn=0875592309|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began selling off some of its holdings in Jerusalem after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biu.ac.il/js/rennert/history_12.html|title=The British Mandate|first=David|last=Eisenstadt|date=May 1997|publisher=Ingeborg Rennert Center for Jerusalem Studies|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British developed the field into a triangular district (hence its appellation, "The Triangle"&lt;ref name=kark/&gt;) demarcated by Jaffa Road, Ben Yehuda Street (constructed by the British in 1922) and King George Street (constructed by the British in 1924).&lt;ref name=jerusalem/&gt; Lots were sold to large companies and cooperatives as well as private businesses.&lt;ref name=kark/&gt; Other streets adjacent to the Triangle – Shlomzion Hamalka, Mamilla, Agron, and King David Streets – were zoned for commercial and residential use.&lt;ref name=kark/&gt;

===European ambience===
[[File:KikarZion.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Cafe Europe, located in the Sansur Building at [[Zion Square]], circa 1934–1946.]]
According to Jerusalem architectural historian [[David Kroyanker]], the heyday of the Downtown Triangle lasted from the early 1930s to the 1970s.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; Many stores and restaurants were opened by [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] immigrants who sought to recreate a European ambience in the city center.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; Their upscale [[boutique]]s, [[coffeehouse]]s, [[delicatessen]]s, and exclusive restaurants were frequented by senior Mandate officials and wealthy, English-speaking tourists.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/a-yearning-free-of-illusions-1.390958|title=A Yearning Free of Illusions|first=Noam|last=Dvir|date=19 October 2011|accessdate=24 November 2013|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/hamans-hat-life-in-the-jerusalem-triangle/|title=Haman's Hat: Life in the Jerusalem Triangle|first1=Aviva|last1=Bar-Am|first2=Shmuel|last2=Bar-Am|work=[[The Times of Israel]] |date=24 August 2013|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Israeli stores that sold all kinds of unrelated products under one roof, the Europeans introduced boutiques that featured only one item, such as gloves or ties. Some shops offered unique extras, such as coffeehouses that included an orchestra and dance floor, and a bookstore with a second-floor library.&lt;ref name=nostalgia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/54/ART2/284/157.html|script-title=he:פעם היה פה שמח: געגועים למשולש הזהב של ירושלים|trans-title=Once It Was Happy Here: Nostalgia for the golden triangle of Jerusalem|language=Hebrew|first=Hailit|last=Kreusa-Israel|date=12 September 2011|accessdate=24 November 2013|work=[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European immigrant-owned bookstores fueled the demand for [[detective fiction]], historical reading, and periodicals from Germany and England.&lt;ref name=nostalgia/&gt; [[Steimatzky]], which opened its first bookstore on Jaffa Road in the Triangle in 1925, identified the growing taste for imported newspapers and magazines and bought the franchises for many of them. The European immigrants also created a market for [[cold cut]]s and cheeses, with three competing delicatessens on King George and Ben Yehuda Streets. For many years, the Triangle was also the only place where Jerusalem residents could purchase clothing, shoes, furniture, and household goods.&lt;ref name=nostalgia/&gt;

At its peak, the district was home to 14 cinemas screening the newest [[Hollywood]] fare.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; Located in close proximity to one another, the cinemas would attract both adults and youth, who would afterwards patronize the coffeehouses and restaurants.&lt;ref name=nostalgia/&gt; The Downtown Triangle was the cultural heart of the city and the place "to see and be seen".&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-198546328.html |title=The Internal Triangle|first=Peggy|last=Cidor|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=23 September 2011|accessdate=24 November 2013}} (subscription)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
The cosmopolitan flavor of the Triangle extended to its buildings. The Sansur building, for example, has an "eclectic" design that combines "[[Renaissance Revival architecture|neo-Renaissance]] and [[Classicism#In architecture|classicist]] elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.ildc.co.il/snasur.aspx|title=Sansur Building|publisher=[[Israel Land Development Company]]|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 15 buildings in the Triangle were designed by architect Reuven Avraham Rabinowitz, who often added a row of [[Stonemasonry#Types of stonemasonry|roughly dressed stone]] to the facade to demarcate each story.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

==Decline and rebirth==
[[File:Ben Yehuda Street pedestrian mall.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Ben Yehuda Street (Jerusalem)|Ben Yehuda Street]] pedestrian mall]]
Following the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967, the city embarked on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were opened in the new, outlying neighborhoods of [[Talpiot]], [[Givat Shaul]], and [[Malha]], drawing customers away from the city center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jiis.org/.upload/merkaz%20-%20english.pdf|title=Downtown Jerusalem: The story of Jerusalem's city center and its regeneration|first1=Amnon|last1=Ramon|first2=Aviel|last2=Yelinek|first3=Asaf |last3=Vitman |year=2011|accessdate=24 November 2013|publisher=[[Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies]]|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clientele of the upscale European boutiques had also aged, and the neighborhoods adjacent to downtown became occupied by poor and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews who did not patronize the Triangle. The elegant shops gave way to [[hummus]] restaurants, [[Variety store|dollar stores]], and [[money changer]]s. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas.&lt;ref name=nostalgia/&gt;

In 1982, the city attempted to revitalize the downtown district by closing Ben Yehuda Street and the Triangle's interior streets (Luncz, Dorot Rishonim, Yavetz, Ben Hillel, and HaHistadrut Streets) to traffic, and converting the entire area to an open-air [[pedestrian mall]].&lt;ref name=jerusalem/&gt; Though taxi companies demonstrated against the renovation and merchants claimed it would fail, the idea proved successful. Outdoor cafes, pizzerias, and fast-food restaurants moved into the Triangle, together with shops selling souvenirs, Judaica, and jewelry to tourists.&lt;ref name=jerusalem/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/jerusalem/717289|title=Neighborhoods in Brief|publisher=[[Frommers]]|year=2013|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=james&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZvTLDOgc1EC&amp;pg=PA10 |title=Jerusalem, Jerusalem: How the Ancient City Ignited Our Modern World|first=James|last=Carroll|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2011|isbn= 0547549059|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mashbir&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/a-new-consumer-shrine-1.384833|title=A New Consumer Shrine?|first=Noam|last=Dvir|work=Haaretz|date=16 September 2011|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Street performance|Street musicians]], [[street artist]]s, political promoters, and tables manned by [[Chabad]] and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] add to the lively nature of the mall.&lt;ref name=savitch&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Q4Q0jP8jxAC&amp;pg=PA102|title=Cities in a Time of Terror: Space, Territory, and Local Resilience|first=H.

The introduction of the [[Jerusalem Light Rail]] in December 2011 further increased local and visitor traffic: estimates show that 36,000 pedestrians per day visited the Triangle in April 2012, up from 16,000 per day in April 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hadassahmagazine.org/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=twI6LmN7IzF&amp;b=5698173&amp;ct=12960355|title=Jerusalem on Track|first=Esther|last=Hecht|date=12 February 2013|accessdate=24 November 2013|work=[[Hadassah#Hadassah Magazine|Hadassah Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mall is especially busy on Saturday nights, as eateries that have closed for [[Shabbat]] reopen and the streets are crowded with young Israelis from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name=jerusalem/&gt;&lt;ref name=james/&gt;

Beginning in the late 1990s, the pedestrian mall became noted for hosting a growing presence of at-risk and homeless youth. Three youth centers – Hameshulash, Hezroni's Squat, and The Zone – operate in the vicinity of Zion Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3411265,00.html|title=Square-Dwelling Youths|date=6 December 2007 |first=Yael|last=Ivri|work=[[Ynetnews]]|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tallest building in the Triangle is the seven-story, {{convert|5000|sqm}} '''[[Hamashbir Lazarchan]]''' [[department store]], which opened on the eastern side of Zion Square in 2011. It is the largest department store in Israel&lt;ref name=mashbir/&gt; and the [[Flagship#Retailing|flagship store]] of the 38-store chain.&lt;ref name=greer/&gt; Hamashbir is intimately associated with the Downtown Triangle, as the first Hamashbir store was established  across the street from its current location in 1947, and moved to another vertex of the Triangle, at King George and Ben Yehuda Streets, from 1970 to 2010.&lt;ref name=greer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.jpost.com/HomePage/FrontPage/Article.aspx?id=91244045&amp;cat=1|title=J'lem: Landmark Hamashbir dept. store gets new location|first=Greer Fay|last=Cashman|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freimann and Bein''' (50 Jaffa Road) was the first luxury shoe store in Israel.&lt;ref name=nrg/&gt; Founded by German-Jewish immigrants, it imported quality leather shoes from Europe and attracted a clientele of British officers and Arab sheikhs.&lt;ref name=nrg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/21/ART2/319/114.html|script-title=he:באלה הידיים: גלגולם של העסקים הקטנים|trans-title=With These Hands: Incarnations of Small Businesses|language=Hebrew |first=Michal |last=Toussia Cohen|date=23 December 2011|accessdate=24 November 2013|work=Maariv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The store originally opened in the [[Generali Building]] further east on Jaffa Road in 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.malon.co.il/article.aspx?id=23932|script-title=he:בית ג'נראלי (חברת אחריות ג'נרלי ) רחוב יפו פינת רחוב שלומציון 1|language=Hebrew|trans-title=Generali Building (Generali Insurance Company), Jaffa Road at 1 Shlomzion Street|publisher=malon.co.il|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to 50 Jaffa Road in 1947. It closed in 2014. '''Khalifa Shoes''' (44 Jaffa Road), founded in 1954, is a Jewish family-owned business specializing in Israeli-made shoes and sandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hadassahmagazine.org/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=twI6LmN7IzF&amp;b=5698173&amp;ct=8439817|title=For All Walks of Life|first=Barbara|last=Sofer|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=24 November 2013|work=Hadassah Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest-lasting dining establishments in the Triangle were '''Atara Cafe''' and '''Fink's Bar'''. Atara Cafe operated at 7 Ben Yehuda Street from 1938 to 1996. The European-style coffeehouse was a favorite of Mandate officers, pre-state paramilitary groups, and Israeli politicians, journalists, and bohemians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-27/news/ls-47891_1_landmark-cafe|title=The Final Days of a Landmark Cafe|first=Marjorie|last=Miller|date=27 September 1996|accessdate=30 November 2013|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/LifeStyle/Food-And-Wine/Cafe-Talk-Where-Atara-once-stood-318557 |title=The Final Days of a Landmark Cafe|first=Greer Fay|last=Cashman|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=30 November 2013|work=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fink's Bar, at the corner of King George and HaHistadrut Streets, was open from 1936 to 2006. The intimate, exclusive restaurant was one of the most prestigious dining addresses in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Specializing in European cuisine, the restaurant/bar made its kitchen [[Kashrut|kosher]] in 2003 in order to overcome several years of declining business and broaden its customer base beyond "politicians, journalists and diplomats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/culture/food-wine/newly-kosher-jerusalem-landmark-fink-s-restaurant-widens-customer-base-1.109448|title=Newly kosher Jerusalem landmark Fink's restaurant widens customer base|first=Daphna|last=Berman|date=22 December 2003|accessdate=19 August 2014|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Downtown Triangle includes two hotels. '''Kikar Zion Hotel''' (Zion Square Hotel), which faces Zion Square from the south, occupies the site of the former Zion Cinema that gave the square its name.&lt;ref name=public&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allaboutjerusalem.com/he/article/%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%A8-%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9F-0|script-title=he:כיכר ציבורית מרכזית בליבהּ של ירושלים ומרכז העסקים הראשי |language=Hebrew|trans-title=Central public square in the heart of Jerusalem and the main business center|publisher=allaboutjerusalem.com|year=2014|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cinema was demolished in 1972 and a high-rise building containing the Kikar Zion Hotel (on the upper floors) and a branch of [[Bank Hapoalim]] (on the lower floors) was erected.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref name=public/&gt; As of 2016, the hotel is being renovated for reopening as the Herbert Samuel Hotel. On the northern side of Zion Square stands the '''Jerusalem Hostel'''. This lodging opened as the Tel Aviv Hotel in 1926 and later became known as the Ron Hotel.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; [[Menachem Begin]] stood on one of the hotel's balconies on 3 August 1948, to announce the dissolution of the [[Irgun]] and the sign-up of his soldiers with the [[Israel Defense Forces]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

'''Duke University''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[research university]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. Founded by [[Methodist]]s and [[Quakers]] in the present-day town of [[Trinity, North Carolina|Trinity]] in 1838, the school moved to [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] in 1892.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.duke.edu/uarchives/history/narrativehistory.html|title=Duke University: A Brief Narrative History|last=King|first=William E|publisher=Duke University Archives|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, tobacco and electric power industrialist [[James Buchanan Duke]] established [[The Duke Endowment]] and the institution changed its name to honor his deceased father, [[Washington Duke]].

Duke's campus spans over {{convert|8600|acre|ha|abbr=off}} on three contiguous campuses in Durham as well as a [[Duke University Marine Laboratory|marine lab]] in [[Beaufort, North Carolina|Beaufort]]. The main campus—designed largely by architect [[Julian Abele]]—incorporates [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|Gothic architecture]] with the {{convert|210|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=on}} [[Duke Chapel]] at the campus' center and highest point of elevation. The first-year-populated [[Duke University East Campus|East Campus]] contains [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style architecture, while the main Gothic-style [[Duke University West Campus|West Campus]] {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} away is adjacent to the [[Duke University Health System|Medical Center]]. The university runs two concurrent universities in [[Asia]], [[Duke Kunshan University]] in [[Kunshan|Kunshan, China]], and [[Duke–NUS Medical School|Duke-NUS Medical School]] in [[Singapore]].

Duke is ranked 8th in the [[U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges Ranking|''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' Best Colleges Ranking]] and 22nd in the [[U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global University Ranking|''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' Best Global University Ranking]].

=== Beginnings ===
{{Main|History of Duke University}}

[[File:Wdukebuild.jpg|thumb|alt=Early 20th century black-and-white photo of three-story building|One of the first buildings on the original Durham campus ([[Duke University East Campus|East Campus]]), the Washington Duke Building ("Old Main"), was destroyed by a fire in 1911.]]
Duke started in 1838 as Brown's Schoolhouse, a private subscription school founded in [[Randolph County, North Carolina|Randolph County]] in the present-day town of [[Trinity, North Carolina|Trinity]].&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.duke.edu/uarchives/history/chronology.html|title=A Chronology of Significant Events in Duke University's History|publisher=Duke University Archives|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized by the Union Institute Society, a group of Methodists and Quakers, Brown's Schoolhouse became the Union Institute Academy in 1841 when North Carolina issued a charter. The academy was renamed Normal College in 1851 and then Trinity College in 1859 because of support from the [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Church]].&lt;ref name="chronology" /&gt; In 1892, Trinity College moved to Durham, largely due to generosity from [[Julian Carr (industrialist)|Julian S. Carr]] and [[Washington Duke]], powerful and respected Methodists who had grown wealthy through the tobacco and electrical industries.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; Carr donated land in 1892 for the original Durham campus, which is now known as East Campus. At the same time, Washington Duke gave the school $85,000 for an initial endowment and construction costs—later augmenting his generosity with three separate $100,000 contributions in 1896, 1899, and 1900—with the stipulation that the college "open its doors to women, placing them on an equal footing with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/dukemag/issues/111206/depret.html |last=Pyatt |first=Tim |date=November–December 2006 |title=Retrospective: Selections from University Archives |publisher=Duke Office of Alumni Affairs |volume=92 |issue=6 |accessdate=May 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515204431/http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/dukemag/issues/111206/depret.html |archivedate=May 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 Washington Duke's son, [[James B. Duke]], established [[The Duke Endowment]] with a $40 million trust fund. Income from the fund was to be distributed to hospitals, orphanages, the Methodist Church, and four colleges (including Trinity College). [[William Preston Few]], the president of Trinity at the time, insisted that the institution be renamed Duke University to honor the family's generosity and to distinguish it from the myriad other colleges and universities carrying the "Trinity" name. At first, James B.

In 1878, Trinity (in Randolph County) awarded A.B. degrees to three sisters—Mary, Persis, and Theresa Giles—who had studied both with private tutors and in classes with men. With the relocation of the college in 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to again allow women to be formally admitted to classes as day students. At the time of Washington Duke's donation in 1896, which carried the requirement that women be placed "on an equal footing with men" at the college, four women were enrolled; three of the four were faculty members' children. In 1903 Washington Duke wrote to the Board of Trustees withdrawing the provision, noting that it had been the only limitation he had ever put on a donation to the college. A woman's residential dormitory was built in 1897 and named the Mary Duke Building, after Washington Duke's daughter. By 1904, fifty-four women were enrolled in the college. In 1930, the Woman's College was established as a coordinate to the men's undergraduate college, which had been established and named Trinity College in 1924.&lt;ref name="WashingtonDukeWomen"&gt;{{cite web |last = King |first = William, E. |title = Washington Duke and the Education of Women|website = University Archives |publisher = David M.

The separate Woman's College merged back with Trinity as the liberal arts college for both men and women in 1972. Beginning in the 1970s, Duke administrators began a long-term effort to strengthen Duke's reputation both nationally and internationally. Interdisciplinary work was emphasized, as was recruiting minority faculty and students.

'''Extrusion''' is a process used to create objects of a fixed [[cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] profile. A material is pushed through a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] of the desired cross-section. The two main advantages of this process over other manufacturing processes are its ability to create very complex cross-sections, and to work materials that are brittle, because the material only encounters [[compressive stress|compressive]] and [[shear stress|shear]] stresses. It also forms parts with an excellent surface finish.&lt;ref name=mh&gt;{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|pp=1348–1349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drawing (manufacturing)|Drawing]] is a similar process, which uses the tensile strength of the material to pull it through the die.  This limits the amount of change which can be performed in one step, so it is limited to simpler shapes, and multiple stages are usually needed.  Drawing is the main way to produce [[wire]].  Metal [[Bar stock|bar]]s and [[tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]]s are also often drawn.

Extrusion may be continuous (theoretically producing indefinitely long material) or semi-continuous (producing many pieces). The extrusion process can be done with the material hot or cold.  Commonly extruded materials include [[metal]]s, [[polymer]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[concrete]], [[modelling clay]], and foodstuffs. The products of extrusion are generally called "extrudates".

Also referred to as "hole flanging", hollow cavities within extruded material cannot be produced using a simple flat extrusion die, because there would be no way to support the centre barrier of the die. Instead, the die assumes the shape of a block with depth, beginning first with a shape profile that supports the center section. The die shape then internally changes along its length into the final shape, with the suspended center pieces supported from the back of the die.  The material flows around the supports and fuses together to create the desired closed shape.

The extrusion process in metals may also increase the strength of the material.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
In 1797, [[Joseph Bramah]] patented the first extrusion process for making pipe out of soft metals. It involved preheating the metal and then forcing it through a die via a hand-driven plunger. In 1820 Thomas Burr implemented that process for lead pipe, with a [[hydraulic press]] (also invented by Joseph Bramah). At that time the process was called "squirting". In 1894, Alexander Dick expanded the extrusion process to copper and brass alloys.&lt;ref name=tmeh11&gt;{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|pp=13-11–12|loc=Hot extrusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[Image:Extrusion.JPG|frame|Extrusion of a round blank through a die.]]
The process begins by heating the stock material (for hot or warm extrusion). It is then loaded into the container in the press. A dummy block is placed behind it where the ram then presses on the material to push it out of the die. Afterward the extrusion is stretched in order to straighten it. If better properties are required then it may be [[heat treat]]ed or [[cold work]]ed.&lt;ref name=tmeh11/&gt;

The extrusion ratio is defined as the starting cross-sectional area divided by the cross-sectional area of the final extrusion. One of the main advantages of the extrusion process is that this ratio can be very large while still producing quality parts.

===Hot extrusion===
Hot extrusion is a [[hot working]] process, which means it is done above the material's [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]] temperature to keep the material from [[work hardening]] and to make it easier to push the material through the die. Most hot extrusions are done on horizontal [[hydraulic press]]es that range from {{convert|230|to|11000|metric ton|short ton}}. Pressures range from {{convert|30|to|700|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}, therefore lubrication is required, which can be oil or graphite for lower temperature extrusions, or glass powder for higher temperature extrusions. The biggest disadvantage of this process is its cost for machinery and its upkeep.&lt;ref name=mh/&gt;

The extrusion process is generally economical when producing between several kilograms (pounds) and many tons, depending on the material being extruded. There is a crossover point where [[roll forming]] becomes more economical. For instance, some steels become more economical to roll if producing more than 20,000&amp;nbsp;kg (50,000&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name=tmeh11/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Cold extrusion===
Cold extrusion is done at room temperature or near room temperature. The advantages of this over hot extrusion are the lack of oxidation, higher strength due to [[cold working]], closer tolerances, better surface finish, and fast extrusion speeds if the material is subject to [[Red-short|hot shortness]].&lt;ref name=mh/&gt;

Materials that are commonly cold extruded include: [[lead]], [[tin]], [[aluminum]], [[copper]], [[zirconium]], [[titanium]], [[molybdenum]], [[beryllium]], [[vanadium]], [[niobium]], and [[steel]].

Examples of products produced by this process are: collapsible tubes, [[fire extinguisher]] cases, [[shock absorber]] cylinders and [[gear]] blanks.

===Warm extrusion===
In March 1956, a US Patent was filed for "process for warm extrusion of metal." Patent US3156043 A outlines that a number of important advantages can be achieved with warm extrusion of both ferrous and non-ferrous metals and alloys if a billet to be extruded is changed in its physical properties in response to physical forces by being heated to a temperature below the critical melting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US3156043|title=Process for warm extrusion of metal|last=Grazioso|first=Charles G.|last2=Mulder|first2=Gerard W.|date=1956-03-09|website=Google|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warm extrusion is done above room temperature, but below the recrystallization temperature of the material the temperatures ranges from 800 to 1800&amp;nbsp;°F (424 to 975&amp;nbsp;°C). It is usually used to achieve the proper balance of required forces, ductility and final extrusion properties.&lt;ref name=mf/&gt;

===Friction extrusion===
{{main article|Friction extrusion}}
Friction extrusion was invented at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended primarily as a method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials&lt;ref&gt;“Forming metallic composite materials by urging base materials together under shear” US patent #5262123 A, Inventors: W. Thomas, E. Nicholas, and S. Jones, Original Assignee: The Welding Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate or they may be counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=W.|last2=Reynolds|first2=A.P.|title=Production of wire via friction extrusion of aluminum alloy machining chips|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0924013610002463|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=210|issue=15|pages=2231–2237|doi=10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2010.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Microextrusion===
{{main article|Microextrusion}}
Microextrusion is a [[Microfabrication#Microforming|microforming]] extrusion process performed at the submillimeter range. Like extrusion, metal is pushed through a die orifice, but the resulting product's cross section can fit through a 1mm square. Several microextrusion processes have been developed since microforming was envisioned in 1990.&lt;ref name="EngelMicro02"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Microforming - From Basic research to its realization |journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology |author1=Engel, U. |author2=Eckstein, R. |volume=125–126 |issue=2002 |pages=35–44 |year=2002 |doi=10.1016/S0924-0136(02)00415-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DixitMicro12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYlJbKw_azEC&amp;pg=PA264 |chapter=Chapter 15: Microextrusion |title=Micromanufacturing Processes |author1=Dixit, U.S. |author2=Das, R. |editor=Jain, V.K. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=263–282 |year=2012 |isbn=9781439852903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FuARev13"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A review on the state-of-the-art microforming technologies |journal=International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology |author1=Fu, M.W. |author2=Chan, W.L. |volume=67 |issue=9 |pages=2411–2437 |year=2013 |doi=10.1007/s00170-012-4661-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forward (ram and [[Semi-finished casting products#Billet|billet]] move in the same direction) and backward (ram and billet move in the opposite direction) microextrusion were first introduced, with forward rod-backward cup and double cup extrusion methods developing later.&lt;ref name="DixitMicro12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FuMicro14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yie_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 |chapter=Chapter 4: Microforming Processes |title=Micro-scaled Products Development via Microforming: Deformation Behaviours, Processes, Tooling and its Realization |author1=Fu, M.W. |author2=Chan, W.L. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=73–130 |year=2014 |isbn=9781447163268 |accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of method, one of the greatest challenges of creating a successful microextrusion machine is the manufacture of the die and ram. "The small size of the die and ram, along with the stringent accuracy requirement, needs suitable manufacturing processes."&lt;ref name="DixitMicro12" /&gt; Additionally, as Fu and Chan pointed out in a 2013 state-of-the-art technology review, several issues must still be resolved before microextrusion and other microforming technologies can be implemented more widely, including [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation load and defects]], forming system stability, mechanical properties, and other size-related effects on the [[crystallite]] (grain) structure and boundaries.&lt;ref name="DixitMicro12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FuARev13" /&gt;

===Extrusion defects===
*Surface cracking occurs when the surface of an extrusion splits
.  This is often caused by the extrusion temperature, friction, or speed being too high.  It can also happen at lower temperatures if the extruded product temporarily sticks to the die.
*Pipe – A flow pattern that draws the surface oxides and impurities to the center of the product.  Such a pattern is often caused by high friction or cooling of the outer regions of the billet.
*Internal cracking – When the center of the extrusion develops cracks or voids.  These cracks are attributed to a state of hydrostatic tensile stress at the centerline in the deformation zone in the die. (A similar situation to the necked region in a tensile stress specimen)
*Surface lines – When there are lines visible on the surface of the extruded profile. This depends heavily on the quality of the die production and how well the die is maintained, as some residues of the material extruded can stick to the die surface and produce the embossed lines.

==Equipment==
[[image:Al extrusion machine with dies.jpg|thumb|A horizontal hydraulic press for hot aluminum extrusion (loose dies and scrap visible in foreground)]]
There are many different variations of extrusion equipment. They vary by four major characteristics:&lt;ref name=mh/&gt;

# Movement of the extrusion with relation to the ram. If the die is held stationary and the ram moves towards it then it is called "direct extrusion". If the ram is held stationary and the die moves towards the ram it is called "indirect extrusion".
# The position of the press, either vertical or horizontal.
# The type of drive, either hydraulic or mechanical.
# The type of load applied, either conventional (variable) or [[hydrostatic]].

A single or twin screw auger, powered by an electric motor, or a ram, driven by hydraulic pressure (often used for steel and titanium alloys), oil pressure (for aluminium), or in other specialized processes such as rollers inside a perforated drum for the production of many simultaneous streams of material.

Typical extrusion presses cost more than $100,000, whereas dies can cost up to $2000.

===Forming internal cavities===
[[Image:Al extrusion die set.jpg|thumb|left|Two-piece aluminum extrusion die set (parts shown separated.) The male part (at right) is for forming the internal cavity in the resulting round tube extrusion.]]

There are several methods for forming internal cavities in extrusions. One way is to use a hollow billet and then use a fixed or floating [[mandrel]]. A fixed mandrel, also known as a German type, means it is integrated into the dummy block and stem. A floating mandrel, also known as a French type, floats in slots in the dummy block and aligns itself in the die when extruding. If a solid billet is used as the feed material then it must first be pierced by the mandrel before extruding through the die. A special press is used in order to control the mandrel independently from the ram.&lt;ref name=mh/&gt; The solid billet could also be used with a spider die, porthole die or bridge die. All of these types of dies incorporate the mandrel in the die and have "legs" that hold the mandrel in place. During extrusion the metal divides, flows around the legs, then merges, leaving weld lines in the final product.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|pp=13–21|loc=Hot extrusion: Tooling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct extrusion===
[[Image:Extrusion force plot.png|thumb|300px|Plot of forces required by various extrusion processes.]]

Direct extrusion, also known as forward extrusion, is the most common extrusion process. It works by placing the billet in a heavy walled container. The billet is pushed through the die by a ram or screw. There is a reusable dummy block between the ram and the billet to keep them separated. The major disadvantage of this process is that the force required to extrude the billet is greater than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the [[friction]]al forces introduced by the need for the billet to travel the entire length of the container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of process and slowly decreases as the billet is used up. At the end of the billet the force greatly increases because the billet is thin and the material must flow radially to exit the die. The end of the billet (called the butt end) is not used for this reason.&lt;ref name=tmeh13&gt;{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|p=13-13|loc=Hot extrusion: Methods of extruding: Direct extrusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indirect extrusion===
In indirect extrusion, also known as backwards extrusion, the billet and container move together while the die is stationary. The die is held in place by a "stem" which has to be longer than the container length. The maximum length of the extrusion is ultimately dictated by the [[column]] strength of the stem. Because the billet moves with the container the frictional forces are eliminated. This leads to the following advantages:&lt;ref name=tmeh14&gt;{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 25 to 30% reduction of friction, which allows for extruding larger billets, increasing speed, and an increased ability to extrude smaller cross-sections
*There is less of a tendency for extrusions to crack because there is no heat formed from friction
*The container liner will last longer due to less wear
*The billet is used more uniformly so extrusion defects and coarse grained peripherals zones are less likely.

The disadvantages are:&lt;ref name=tmeh14/&gt;
*Impurities and defects on the surface of the billet affect the surface of the extrusion. These defects ruin the piece if it needs to be [[anodize]]d or the aesthetics are important. In order to get around this the billets may be wire brushed, machined or chemically cleaned before being used.
*This process isn't as versatile as direct extrusions because the cross-sectional area is limited by the maximum size of the stem.

===Hydrostatic extrusion===
In the hydrostatic extrusion process the billet is completely surrounded by a pressurized liquid, except where the billet contacts the die. This process can be done hot, warm, or cold, however the temperature is limited by the stability of the fluid used. The process must be carried out in a sealed cylinder to contain the hydrostatic medium. The fluid can be pressurized two ways:&lt;ref name=tmeh14/&gt;

#''Constant-rate extrusion'': A ram or plunger is used to pressurize the fluid inside the container.
#''Constant-pressure extrusion'': A pump is used, possibly with a [[hydraulic intensifier|pressure intensifier]], to pressurize the fluid, which is then pumped to the container.

The advantages of this process include:&lt;ref name=tmeh14/&gt;

*No friction between the container and the billet reduces force requirements. This ultimately allows for faster speeds, higher reduction ratios, and lower billet temperatures.
*Usually the ductility of the material increases when high pressures are applied.
*An even flow of material.
*Large billets and large cross-sections can be extruded.
*No billet residue is left on the container walls.

The disadvantages are:&lt;ref name=tmeh14/&gt;

*The billets must be prepared by tapering one end to match the die entry angle. This is needed to form a seal at the beginning of the cycle. Usually the entire billet needs to be machined to remove any surface defects.
*Containing the fluid under high pressures can be difficult.
*A billet remnant or a plug of a tougher material must be left at the end of the extrusion to prevent a sudden release of the extrusion fluid.

===Drives===
Most modern direct or indirect extrusion presses are hydraulically driven, but there are some small mechanical presses still used. Of the hydraulic presses there are two types: direct-drive oil presses and accumulator water drives.

Direct-drive oil presses are the most common because they are reliable and robust. They can deliver over 35 MPa (5000 psi). They supply a constant pressure throughout the whole billet. The disadvantage is that they are slow, between 50 and 200&amp;nbsp;mm/s (2–8 ips).&lt;ref name=tmeh16&gt;{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|pp=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accumulator water drives are more expensive and larger than direct-drive oil presses, and they lose about 10% of their pressure over the stroke, but they are much faster, up to 380&amp;nbsp;mm/s (15 ips). Because of this they are used when extruding steel. They are also used on materials that must be heated to very hot temperatures for safety reasons.&lt;ref name=tmeh16/&gt;

Hydrostatic extrusion presses usually use [[castor oil]] at pressure up to 1400 MPa (200 ksi). Castor oil is used because it has good lubricity and high pressure properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|pp=13–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Die  design==
The design of an extrusion profile has a large impact on how readily it can be extruded. The maximum size for an extrusion is determined by finding the smallest circle that will fit around the cross-section, this is called the ''circumscribing circle''. This diameter, in turn, controls the size of the die required, which ultimately determines if the part will fit in a given press. For example, a larger press can handle {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} diameter circumscribing circles for aluminium and 55&amp;nbsp;cm (22&amp;nbsp;in) diameter circles for steel and titanium.&lt;ref name=mh/&gt;

The complexity of an extruded profile can be roughly quantified by calculating the ''shape factor'', which is the amount of surface area generated per unit mass of extrusion. This affects the cost of tooling as well as the rate of production.&lt;ref&gt;[https://edmolimited.co.uk/education/frequently-asked-questions/aluminium-extrusions/#q27 Extrusion Tooling – Edmo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thicker sections generally need an increased section size. In order for the material to flow properly legs should not be more than ten times longer than their thickness. If the cross-section is asymmetrical, adjacent sections should be as close to the same size as possible. Sharp corners should be avoided; for aluminium and magnesium the minimum radius should be 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm (1/64&amp;nbsp;in) and for steel corners should be {{convert|0.75|mm|abbr=on}} and [[fillet (mechanics)|fillet]]s should be {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}}. The following table lists the minimum cross-section and thickness for various materials.&lt;ref name=mh/&gt;

==Materials==

===Metal===
Metals that are commonly extruded include:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|pp=13–15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Aluminium]]''' is the most commonly extruded material. Aluminium can be hot or cold extruded. If it is hot extruded it is heated to 575 to 1100&amp;nbsp;°F (300 to 600&amp;nbsp;°C). Examples of products include [[profile (engineering)|profile]]s for tracks, frames, rails, [[mullions]], and [[heat sink]]s.
* '''[[Brass]]''' is used to extrude corrosion free rods, automobile parts, pipe fittings, engineering parts.
* '''[[Copper]]''' (1100 to 1825&amp;nbsp;°F (600 to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C)) pipe, wire, rods, bars, tubes, and welding electrodes. Often more than 100 ksi (690 MPa) is required to extrude copper.
* '''[[Lead]]''' and '''[[tin]]''' (maximum 575&amp;nbsp;°F (300&amp;nbsp;°C)) pipes, wire, tubes, and cable sheathing. Molten lead may also be used in place of billets on vertical extrusion presses.
* '''[[Magnesium]]''' (575 to 1100&amp;nbsp;°F (300 to 600&amp;nbsp;°C)) aircraft parts and nuclear industry parts. Magnesium is about as extrudable as aluminum.
* '''[[Zinc]]''' (400 to 650&amp;nbsp;°F (200 to 350&amp;nbsp;°C)) rods, bar, tubes, hardware components, fitting, and handrails.
* '''[[Steel]]''' (1825 to 2375&amp;nbsp;°F (1000 to 1300&amp;nbsp;°C)) rods and tracks. Usually [[plain carbon steel]] is extruded, but alloy steel and [[stainless steel]] can also be extruded.
* '''[[Titanium]]''' (1100 to 1825&amp;nbsp;°F (600 to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C)) aircraft components including seat tracks, engine rings, and other structural parts.

Magnesium and aluminium alloys usually have a {{convert|0.75|μm|μin|abbr=on}} [[Root mean square|RMS]] or better surface finish. Titanium and steel can achieve a {{convert|3|μm|μin}} RMS.&lt;ref name=mh/&gt;

In 1950, Ugine Séjournet, of [[France]], invented a process which uses glass as a lubricant for extruding steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bauser |first=Martin |last2=Sauer |first2=Günther |last3=Siegert |first3=Klaus |title=Extrusion |publisher=ASM International |page=270 |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9NnDQ0oJFLEC |isbn=0-87170-837-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ugine-Sejournet, or Sejournet, process is now used for other materials that have melting temperatures higher than steel or that require a narrow range of temperatures to extrude, such as the [[platinum-iridium alloy]] used to make [[kilogram]] mass standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Techniques in the Manufacture of Platinum-Iridium Mass Standards |first=T. J. |last=Quinn |journal=Platinum Metals Review |year=1986 |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=74–79 |url=http://www.technology.matthey.com/article/30/2/74-79/ |quote=The forged billet is then delivered to the National Physical Laboratory where it is extruded at 1200&amp;nbsp;°C, using glass as the lubricant, to a cylinder about 43&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process starts by heating the materials to the extruding temperature and then rolling it in glass powder. The glass melts and forms a thin film, 20 to 30 [[thou (length)|mils]] (0.5 to 0.75&amp;nbsp;mm), in order to separate it from chamber walls and allow it to act as a lubricant. A thick solid glass ring that is 0.25 to 0.75 in (6 to 18&amp;nbsp;mm) thick is placed in the chamber on the die to lubricate the extrusion as it is forced through the die. A second advantage of this glass ring is its ability to insulate the heat of the billet from the die. The extrusion will have a 1 mil thick layer of glass, which can be easily removed once it cools.&lt;ref name=mf&gt;{{Citation |last=Avitzur |first=B. |contribution=Metal forming |year=1987 |title=Encyclopedia of Physical Science &amp; Technology |volume=8 | pages=80–109 |place=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another breakthrough in lubrication is the use of phosphate coatings. With this process, in conjunction with glass lubrication, steel can be cold extruded. The phosphate coat absorbs the liquid glass to offer even better lubricating properties.&lt;ref name=mf/&gt;

{{Main article|Plastics extrusion}}

[[Plastics extrusion]] commonly uses plastic chips or pellets, which are usually dried, to drive out moisture, in a hopper before going to the feed screw. The polymer resin is heated to molten state by a combination of heating elements and shear heating from the extrusion screw.  The screw, or screws as the case with twin screw extrusion, forces the resin through a die, forming the resin into the desired shape. The extrudate is cooled and solidified as it is pulled through the die or water tank. A "caterpillar haul-off" (called a "puller" in the US) is used to provide tension on the extrusion line which is essential for overall quality of the extrudate. Pelletizers can also create this tension while pulling extruded strands in to be cut. The caterpillar haul-off must provide a consistent pull; otherwise, variation in cut lengths or distorted product will result.  In some cases (such as fibre-reinforced tubes) the extrudate is pulled through a very long die, in a process called "pultrusion". The configuration of the interior screws are a driving force dependent on the application. Mixing elements or convey elements are used in various formations. Extrusion is common in the application of adding colorant to molten plastic thus creating specific custom color.

A multitude of polymers are used in the production of plastic tubing, pipes, rods, rails, seals, and sheets or films.

===Ceramic===
Ceramic can also be formed into shapes via extrusion. [[Terracotta]] extrusion is used to produce pipes. Many modern bricks are also manufactured using a brick extrusion process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umich.edu/~bricks/brickwebsite/setting_drying/setting_drying_intro.htm Brick manufacturing process]&lt;/ref&gt; {403 forbidden link 12Jul15}

==Applications==

===Food===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
{{main article|Food extrusion}}
[[File:Macaroni closeup.jpg|thumb|Elbow [[macaroni]] is an extruded hollow pasta.]]
With the advent of industrial manufacturing, extrusion found application in [[food processing]] of instant foods and snacks, along with its already known uses in plastics and metal fabrication.  The main role of extrusion was originally developed for conveying and shaping fluid forms of processed raw materials. Present day, extrusion cooking technologies and capabilities have developed into sophisticated processing functions including: mixing, conveying, shearing, separation, heating, cooling, shaping, co-extrusion, venting volatiles and moisture, encapsulation, flavor generation and sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1OkAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Extrusion Cooking: Technologies and Applications|last=Guy|first=R.|date=2001-06-25|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9781855736313|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products such as certain [[pasta]]s, many [[breakfast cereal]]s, premade [[cookie dough]], some [[french fries]], certain [[baby food]]s, dry or semi-moist [[pet food]] and ready-to-eat snacks are mostly manufactured by extrusion. It is also used to produce [[modified starch]], and to pelletize [[Compound feed|animal feed]].

Generally, high-temperature extrusion is used for the manufacture of ready-to-eat snacks, while cold extrusion is used for the manufacture of pasta and related products intended for later cooking and consumption. The processed products have low moisture and hence considerably higher shelf life, and provide variety and convenience to consumers.
  
In the extrusion process, raw materials are first ground to the correct particle size. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients may be added, and [[steam]] is injected to start the cooking process. The preconditioned mix is then passed through an extruder, where it is forced through a die and cut to the desired length. The cooking process takes place within the extruder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the pressure generated (10–20&amp;nbsp;bar). The main independent parameters during extrusion cooking are feed rate, particle size of the raw material, barrel temperature, screw speed and moisture content. The extruding process can induce both [[protein denaturation]] and [[starch gelatinization]], depending on inputs and parameters. Sometimes, a catalyst is used, for example, when producing texturised vegetable proteins (TVP).

===Drug carriers===
{{Expand section|date=August 2008}}
For use in pharmaceutical products, extrusion through nano-porous, polymeric filters is being used to produce suspensions of lipid vesicles [[liposome]]s or [[transfersome]]s with a particular size of a narrow [[Dispersity|size distribution]]. The anti-cancer drug [[Doxorubicin]] in liposome delivery system is formulated by extrusion, for example. Hot melt extrusion is also utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation to mix materials together and ‘extrude’ them through a die. Twin-screw high shear extruders blend materials and simultaneously break up particles. The resulting particle can be blended with compression aids and compressed into tablets or filled into unit dose capsules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extrusion Spheronisation|url=http://www.pharmacmc.com/extrusion-spheronisation/|website=PharmaCMC|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomass briquettes===
{{main article|Biomass briquettes}}

The extrusion production technology of fuel briquettes is the process of extrusion screw wastes (straw, sunflower husks, buckwheat, etc.) or finely shredded wood waste (sawdust) under high pressure when heated from 160 to 350&amp;nbsp;°C. The resulting fuel [[briquette]]s do not include any of the binders, but one natural – the lignin contained in the cells of plant wastes. The temperature during compression causes melting of the surface of bricks, making it more solid, which is important for the transportation of briquettes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20354">The '''Florida Board of Accountancy''' ('''FLBOA''') regulates [[Certified Public Accountant]]s and Certified Public Accounting Firms for the State of Florida. The FLBOA is created in Florida Statutes Chapter 473&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0400-0499/0473/0473ContentsIndex.html&amp;StatuteYear=2011&amp;Title=-%3E2011-%3EChapter%20473|title=Statutes &amp; Constitution

    :
  
  Online Sunshine|website=www.leg.state.fl.us|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is administered by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.  Florida Statutes Chapter 473 permits the FLBOA to establish rules that are codified in the [[Florida Administrative Code|Florida Administrative Code (FAC)]] in sections 61H1-19 through 61H1-39.

== Composition ==
The FLBOA members are appointed by the Governor of the State of Florida&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flgov.com/governor-rick-scott-menu/|title=Governor Rick Scott|website=www.flgov.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed by the Florida Senate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flsenate.gov/|title=Calendar for 1/31/2018 -
    The Florida Senate|website=www.flsenate.gov|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  There are nine members, seven are licensed CPAs and two are public members who are not and have never been a CPA.  

== Roles ==
The FLBOA has three main functions:
* Administering applications to sit for the CPA Examination&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-11-27|title=Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uniform_Certified_Public_Accountant_Examination&amp;oldid=812362025|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and applications for licensure 
* Disciplining licensees
* Approving rules in the FAC and changes to the FAC 
* 
All current and past members of the FLBOA are members of the [[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy]] (NASBA).    

== Licensing ==
The Florida Board of Accountancy handles applications to sit for the Uniform CPA Examination. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.myfloridalicense.com/CheckListDetail.asp?SID=&amp;xactCode=1010&amp;clientCode=0101&amp;XACT_DEFN_ID=2759|title=Licensing Portal - Checklist Details|website=www.myfloridalicense.com|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements to take the Uniform CPA Examination include:     
* Completion of 120 semester hours of college credit, including 24 semester credit hours of upper division accounting courses,     
* Complete a form disclosing: 1) whether you have a criminal record,  2) whether any judgement or open investigation relating to accounting, 3) whether you have ever had a professional license application denied, 3) whether you have ever had a professional license disciplined, and 5) whether you have ever been denied the right to sit for the CPA Examination.     
The Florida Board of Accountancy also handles applications for licenses for individual license to practice public accounting.  The requirements for individual licensure include:  
* Pass the Uniform Accountancy Examination,  
* Completion 150 semester hours of college credit from an accredited university, with certain specific required courses including 30 semester hours in upper division accounting courses and 36 semester hours in upper division general business courses, and  
* Completion of the equivalent of one year of work.   
The Florida Board of Accountancy also handles applications for firm licenses.  Firms are required to have a Firm license if they  
* Have an office in Florida that conducts audits, or  
* Have a name that includes CPA or a similar designation.   
Firms without an office in Florida may practice in Florida without a license, if   
* It is enrolled in Peer Review, and   
* Meets Firm structure requirements.   

== Discipline ==
Florida's disciplinary system is complaint based.  All complaints are administered on a confidential basis.  Complaints are presented to a Probable Cause Panel to determine if there is probable cause that there is a violation of Florida Statutes or Administrative Code.  If no probable cause is not found or if the Probable Cause Panel issues a letter of guidance in lieu of a finding of probable cause, the matter is closed and remains a confidential issue.  If probable cause is found, the matter is made public and brought before the Board at a Public Meeting.  Discipline is considered and if approved is evidenced through a Final Order.  

== Rulemaking ==
The Florida Board of Accountancy is authorized by Florida Statutes Chapter 455 Professions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2017/chapter455|title=Chapter 455  - 2017 Florida Statutes - The Florida Senate|website=flsenate.gov|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chapter 473 Public Accountancy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2017/chapter473|title=Chapter 473  - 2017 Florida Statutes - The Florida Senate|website=flsenate.gov|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  These laws establish authority to create the Board of Accountancy and create, amend and repeal administrative rules.  The Administrative Rules are contained in the Florida Administrative Code, Chapter 61H1-19 thru 39&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flrules.org/Gateway/Division.asp?DivID=280|title=Div. 61H1: Board of Accountancy - Florida Administrative Rules, Law, Code, Register - FAC, FAR, eRulemaking|website=www.flrules.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The provisions of these rules may be temporarily or permanently waived by a majority vote of the Board.    

Affected persons, or licensees, may request the Board of Accountancy make a "Declaratory Statement"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myfloridalicense.com/DBPR/certified-public-accounting/declaratory-statements/#1492189006974-c151c24b-78980c9a-e4686d29-a674|title=Certified Public Accounting – Declaratory Statements – MyFloridaLicense.com|website=www.myfloridalicense.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpreting how the Board will rule on a matter in advance.  The licensee must provide specific facts and circumstances and the Declaratory Statement only applies to those specific facts and circumstances.  The most recent Declaratory Statement covered accounting and tax services provided to companies in the marijuana industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/florida-issues-ethics-guidance-for-70450/|title=Florida Issues Ethics Guidance for Accountants Advising Marijuana Businesses {{!}} JD Supra|work=JD Supra|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Florida Governor [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward|Napoleon B. Broward]] signed the Florida  Accountancy Act in 1905, beginning the regulation of the public accounting profession in 1905.  The Act began both the regulation of CPA's and the regulation of unlicensed activity in Florida.  In 1927, Florida prohibited the use of "public accountant" by nonlicensees.  In 1937, the Board used that power to prohibit the use of "public accountant" in the case ''Abess v. Heller.''  The courts granted the injunction and Heller appealed leading to the Florida Supreme Court decision in 1938 upholding the ability to license unregulated activity.  The Florida Supreme Court narrowed the ability of the Board of Accountancy to limit unlicensed activity in the 1957 case ''Florida Accountants Association v. Dandelake.'' The court ruled that unlicensed activity could only be limited if the accountant used the title CPA or PA or if the public was confused in the title of a CPA and a non-CPA.  The Accountancy Act was changed in 1969 to remove the restriction of non-CPAs practicing public accounting, recognizing that many accounting activities could be performed by non CPAs so long as the public was not confused.    

'''National Firms Enter Florida'''      

The movement towards national and international enterprises who relied on larger CPA firms and more national and international CPA firms led to problems in Florida.  The Florida regulations required that all partners and CPAs be licensed in Florida.  Other than three firms grandfathered in before the licensing requirements, CPA firms would need to obtain a temporary license for each engagement because even one partner in another state who did not have a Florida CPA license could prevent a Firm from being licensed in Florida.  Two cases heard by the Florida Supreme Court, ''Mercer v. Hemmings'' (1964 and 1966), limited the ability of the State to restrict national firms from practicing in Florida.  The election in 1967 of Florida Governor Claude Kirk, the first Republican governor since reconstruction, a progrowth governor resulted in the appointment of Board of Accountancy members who favored allowing national firms to practice in Florida.  R. Bob Smith, on behalf of the national firms,  led an effort to separate the Board of Accountancy (a Florida Regulatory body) and the Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants (a membership organization representing the CPA profession).  In 1967, Clifford Beasely was the executive director of both entities.  Mr. Beasley remained the FICPA Executive Director and Douglas Thompson, an auditor with the Auditor General of the State of Florida, became the Executive Director of the Board of Accountancy.  In 1969, the Accountancy Act was amended to permit national firms to practice public accounting in Florida.  The last impediment to national firms practicing public accounting in Florida was the requirement that all partners be CPAs, limiting the ability for firms with Tax and Consulting partners who were not licensed CPAs. in 1997, the Board of Accountancy Act was amended to require only a majority of partners be licensed CPAs.     

'''Continuing Professional Education'''      

In 1969, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recommended mandatory Continuing Professional Education to improve quality in the profession.  Following this movement, in 1973 Florida enacted a law requiring 90 hours of Continuing Professional Education every three years.  Statutory changes over the next 30 years led to the current law passed in 2004 requiring 80 hours of Continuing Professional Education every two years.    

'''Increasing College Credit from 120 hours to 150 hours'''  

Also in 1969, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recommended additional education beyond the bachelor's degree as a requirement for licensure.  Over the next ten years, Florida discussed increasing the number of college credits required for licensure.  In 1979, the State of Florida enacted the 150 hour requirement, becoming only the second state to enact such requirement.  The requirement was phased in beginning in 1984.  Ultimately, all 50 states would follow and the 150 hour requirement of college credit is now the standard for the profession in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=FICPA Honoring Tradition, Defining Excellence, Creating the Future|last=Lloyd|first=Turman|publisher=Self Published|year=2007|isbn=|location=FICPA - Tallahassee, FL|pages=24–32, 44–4862–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advertising by CPAs'''       

During the 1990s, Florida was a party in two US Supreme Court cases shaped the way the CPA profession was regulated.      

* The first case began in 1991 when a CPA and attorney, Syvia Ibanez, advertised that she had a law firm that did tax and estate planning.  While she was a licensed CPA, the law firm was not licensed and her advertisement included reference to another certification by an entity not recognized by the Board.  The Board disciplined Ibanez for "false, deceptive, and misleading" advertising and the lower court upheld the discipline in 1993.  In 1994, in ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_512?action=edit Ibanez v. Florida Board of Accountancy]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/06/22/kagan-gives-uva-prof-shoutout-for-provoking-good-and-hard-thinking/?slreturn=20180524114128|title=National Law Journal|last=|first=|date=|work=National Law Journal|access-date=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US Supreme Court overturned the lower court's decision and struck down the restrictions on "certified" unless they were in fact misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/512/136/|title=Justia US Supreme Court|last=|first=|date=|website={{meta.siteName}}|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second case began in 1994 with Stephen Miller who was at the time working for American Express Tax and Business Services. American Express Tax and Business Services was not a licensed firm and advertised that Miller was a CPA.  Florida regulations prohibited a non licensed firm from advertising that included reference to a CPA.  Miller and American Express Tax and Business Services were disciplined by the Board of Accountancy.  The lower courts overturned the discipline and the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in 1997 in a case titled ''Stephen Miller, American Express Tax and Business Services v. George Stuart, Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, et al.''  The case centered around whether a CPA and a nonlicensed firm they worked for could advertise that they were licensed CPA.  The US Supreme Court let stand the lower court ruling that Miller and American Express could advertise that Miller was a CPA even though American Express was not a licensed firm on the grounds that restricting truthful statements was a violation of the First Amendment's Freedom of Speech.  In response, Florida changed its Accountancy Act to restrict what CPAs may do and not restricting how and under what circumstances they call themselves CPAs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-11th-circuit/1188123.html|title=FindLaw's United States Eleventh Circuit case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.     

'''[[Peer review|Peer Review]]'''      

Peer Review began as a concept in the 1960s as a way of self-regulation of the CPA profession, where peer CPA's would review the CPA practice of another CPA and conclude on whether CPA was following standards.  in 1972, the American Institute began a program to review firms who audited public companies. US congressional hearings to determine if government oversight of the profession resulted in the 1976 ''Metcalf Report "The Accounting Establishment"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metcalf-report.asp|title=Metcalf Report|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2010-11-15|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''  In 1988, the American Institute made Peer Review a Mandatory requirement for Firm membership.  Several states began requiring Peer Review as a condition for licensure.  Two famous Accounting Scandals in 2001 and 2002 (Eron and WorldCom)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-03|title=Enron scandal|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enron_scandal&amp;oldid=833981587|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; would lead to the 2002 enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-04|title=Sarbanes–Oxley Act|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act&amp;oldid=834207557|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (SOX).  SOX would replace Peer Review for public company auditors with a structure for government inspections of CPA firms.  Florida was slow to enact any Peer Review legislation. Finally in 2013, Florida became the 49th state to enact Peer Review legislation.  Florida's Peer Review statute only requires enrollment in a Peer Review program and does not require completion of a Peer Review&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hortyspringer.com/peer-review-statutes-by-state/florida-peer-review-statute/|title=Florida Peer Review Statute|website=www.hortyspringer.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.     

Peer Review was first designed as a process to improve practices of CPA firms and the original intent was to be rehabilitative in nature.  As such, generally, the peer review reports are used as a basis for discipline.  Some states have gone beyond the original intent and required CPA firms to provide Peer Review reports to their State Accountancy Board, posted Peer Review Reports on public websites or used the issuance of multiple failed Peer Reviews as a basis for discipline.  Also, the Governmental Accountability Office&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/|title=GAO|last=|first=|date=|website=GAO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has issued the Yellow Book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/yellowbook/overview|title=Yellow Book Standards|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which requires CPA Firms that issue audit reports on financial statements or performance audit reports to provide their Peer Review report to the client prior to commencing the audit.     

'''Executive Directors'''     

The Executive Director of the Florida Board of Accountancy shared the position of the Executive Director of Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants at its inception until 1968:     

* Veloria Kelly, Division Director, Division of Certified Public Accounting (2016 - current)
* John Johnson, Division Director, Division of Certified Public Accounting (2002 - 2006)
* Martha Willis, Division Director, Division of Certified Public Accounting (1980 - 2002)
*Cleve Nolte, Executive Director, Board of Public Accountancy
* Douglas Thompson, Executive Director, Board of Public Accountancy 
* Clifford Beasley, Executive Director, Board of Public Accountancy

== Accountancy License Mobility  ==
The Florida Board of Accountancy has adopted both individual mobility for CPAs and Firm mobility for CPA Firms.      

'''Individual Mobility'''     

NASBA and the AICPA changed the Uniform Accountancy Act in 2007 to encourage mobility of CPA licenses.  The concept of mobility allows a CPA to be licensed in its Home State and then to practice as a CPA in other states without completing the unique regulatory requirements of the other states. The principle of mobility is based on three things: 1) no notice requirement of the non home state, 2) no fee paid to the non home state, and 3) agreement to abide by the laws of the non home state and accepting jurisdiction of discipline of the non home state.  Florida enacted Individual mobility in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/state/downloadabledocuments/sumcpamobility-05192014.pdf|title=AICPA Individual Mobility|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hawaii is the only state yet to enact mobility. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accountingweb.com/practice/practice-excellence/cpa-mobility-becomes-law-in-california|title=California Passes Mobility|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Firm Mobility'''     

NASBA and the AICPA further changed the Uniform Accountancy Act in 2014 to encourage mobility of CPA Firm licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aicpa.org/advocacy/state/cpafirmmobility.html|title=AICPA Firm Mobility|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of Firm mobility allows a CPA Firm to be licensed in states where it has a physical office to practice as a CPA Firm in other states without completing the unique regulatory requirements of the other states.  CPA Firm mobility requires compliance with Peer Review requirements and CPA ownership requirements. Florida enacted Firm mobility in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbc-2.com/story/35738531/gov-scott-signs-38-bills-into-law|title=Changes to Accountancy Laws|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 26 have either enacted or are in the process of enacting Firm mobility.

'''flybmi''', legally ''British Midland Regional Limited'' and formerly branded as '''bmi regional''', is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[regional airline]] that operates scheduled passenger services across the UK and Europe. The airline's head office is in [[East Midlands Airport]] in [[North West Leicestershire]], with its registered office at [[Glasgow Airport]]. The airline has operating bases at Aberdeen, Brussels, Bristol, East Midlands, Newcastle and Munich.

flybmi, previously known as bmi Regional, was a former subsidiary of [[British Midland International]] (bmi), which was purchased from [[Lufthansa]] by [[International Airlines Group]] (IAG) on 20 April 2012. Regional was sold to Sector Aviation Holdings in May 2012 and operated as an independent airline from October 2012. In August 2015, the airline became part of a new regional airline group, Airline Investments Limited (AIL),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-33766635 | title = New regional airline group created | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate = 2016-03-29 | date = 2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Loganair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flybmi.com/press-release/new-regional-airline-group-created-bmi-regional-and-loganair-now-part-of-ail-group/|title=New regional airline group created: bmi regional and Loganair now part of AIL Group|date=2015-08-03|publisher=BMI Regional|access-date=2016-03-29|quote=}}[http://www.flybmi.com/press-release/new-regional-airline-group-created-bmi-regional-and-loganair-now-part-of-ail-group/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Saab-Fairchild SF-340A(QC), Business Air AN0216713.jpg|thumb|A former Business Air [[Saab 340]]]]
[[File:Saab SF.340A G-GNTC BD Cmtr RWY 23.07.98 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Saab 340 of ''British Midland Commuter'' at [[Manchester Airport]] in July 1998.]]
The airline was established in 1987 as ''Business Air'' and started operations in August 1987. In 1998 Business Air was purchased by British Midland and became British Midland Commuter. In 2001, it changed its name to bmi regional and later to flybmi in December 2017.

As a subsidiary of BMI, BMI Regional known then was owned by [[Michael Bishop (businessman)|Sir Michael Bishop]] (50%), [[Lufthansa]] (30%) and [[Scandinavian Airlines]] (20%). Lufthansa purchased Sir Michael Bishop and SAS' stakes in October 2009, taking full ownership of the airline group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/lufthansa-buys-final-20-of-bmi-1796083.html | title=Lufthansa buys final 20% of BMI | first = Sarah | last = Arnott | date = 1 October 2009 | newspaper = [[The Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A restructuring of the group was announced the following month, which also affected Regional's operations. A suspension of loss-making routes and capacity adjustments within the group resulted in Regional having a surplus of three Embraer aircraft in 2010, and the company began consultations with staff over possible job losses. The excess aircraft were leased to other carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flybmi.com/bmi/en-gb/about-us/information-centre/press-releases/20091125.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130103042128/http://www.flybmi.com/bmi/en-gb/about-us/information-centre/press-releases/20091125.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-03 |title=Flights across the UK and Europe - BMI Regional |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

flybmi was acquired by Sector Aviation Holdings, a company predominantly owned and funded by Stephen and Peter Bond, whose family sold helicopter operator [[Bond Aviation Group]] in 2010.  Sector Aviation Holdings also included the founders of Regional's predecessor Business Air, Ian Woodley and Graeme Ross. The sale was announced on 1 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flybmi.com/en/bottom-menu/press/sale-of-bmi-regional-completed |title=Sale of bmi regional completed |publisher=bmi regional |date=1 June 2012 |accessdate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224173320/http://www.flybmi.com/en/bottom-menu/press/sale-of-bmi-regional-completed |archivedate=24 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 flybmi was named the most punctual scheduled airline in the UK for the ninth consecutive year. Based on [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] statistics, the airline achieved an on-time performance of over 92% in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Airliner World|date=May 2014|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2018, BMI Regional rebranded to flybmi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blueswandaily.com/bmi-regional-rebrands-as-flybmi/ BMI Regional rebrands as flybmi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate affairs==

===Offices===
[[File:Bmi regional head office.png|thumb|Head office of flybmi at East Midlands Airport]]
Since being founded as Business Air, the company had always had its [[control room|Operations Control Centre]] located at [[Aberdeen Airport|Aberdeen]]. The occupied building was shared with [[CHC Helicopter]] which utilises the hangar space for helicopter maintenance and storage for its North Sea fleet. Aircraft maintenance is still carried out at the shared hangar, however all other functions have been moved elsewhere.

Following the purchase of Regional in May 2012, Sector Aviation Holdings took the decision to relocate the company headquarters from Aberdeen to Pegasus Business Park, on the grounds of [[East Midlands Airport]].  Whilst a subsidiary, some head office functions were provided by British Midland International at its head office in [[Donington Hall]], [[Castle Donington]].

===Operations===
[[File:Bmi (British Midland) offices - geograph.org.uk - 971803.jpg|thumb|Previous operations office at Aberdeen Airport]]
British Midland Regional Limited holds a [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] Type A Operating Licence, permitting it to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=183&amp;pagetype=90&amp;pageid=340 | title = Type A Operating Licence Holders |publisher=Civil Aviation Authority |date= |accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since becoming an independent airline, flybmi has changed its callsign from "Kittiwake" to "Midland" and on 28 October 2012 announced that it would be using "BM" as the company IATA airline designator in place of the previously used "BD" which belonged to [[British Midland International]].

The airline's three main operating bases are [[Aberdeen Airport]] and [[Bristol Airport]] in the UK, as well as [[Munich Airport]] in Germany. On 23 January 2014, flybmi launched a new domestic operation in Norway with an aircraft based in Stavanger.  This new service provided the first scheduled direct air link between [[Evenes Airport|Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes]] and [[Stavanger Airport|Stavanger]], however this service no longer operates.

Along with the current operating bases, flybmi previously had numerous bases throughout the [[United Kingdom]] with crew stationed at [[Edinburgh Airport]], [[Glasgow Airport]], [[Leeds Bradford Airport]], [[Manchester Airport]] and [[London Heathrow Airport]]. All of these bases had Regional routes operated from them along with routes on behalf of [[British Midland International]] (BMI), Heathrow which was solely mainline routes. A base at [[Birmingham Airport]] opened during May 2013, but on 28 October 2013 it was announced that following a network review the base would close at the end of December 2013.

Using its [[Embraer Regional Jet|Embraer 145]] aircraft, flybmi previously operated a number of shuttle services on behalf of aircraft manufacturer [[Airbus]]. These linked manufacturing sites at [[Airbus Broughton|Broughton]], [[Filton Aerodrome|Filton]] and [[Toulouse Blagnac International Airport|Toulouse]]. Despite previously having crew based at [[Manchester Airport]] and no scheduled services operating from [[Hawarden Airport|Chester Hawarden]], flybmi based crew at Hawarden for the Airbus shuttle flights. Originally the Airbus shuttle operated to [[Filton Aerodrome]] but following its closure in December 2012, the shuttle operation transferred to [[Bristol Airport|Bristol Lulsgate]] in January 2013. This had no impact on crew as they were already based at Bristol. The contract for these corporate shuttle flights was won by [[Eastern Airways]] and as a result flybmi ceased operating these flights in late 2015.

In early 2014, flybmi commenced a contract to operate a further staff shuttle on behalf of helicopter manufacturer [[AgustaWestland]]. This shuttle was previously operated by [[Eastern Airways]] using an Embraer 135 between [[Milan Malpensa Airport|Milan Malpensa]] and [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]]. In 2015 flybmi chose to operate the route from nearby Bristol Airport instead, therefore enabling them to carry commercial passengers on the route also, as well as upgrading the aircraft type.

In summer 2015 the airline based an Embraer 135 and an Embraer 145 at [[Munich Airport|Munich]] to operate services to [[Bern]], [[Liège]] and [[Rotterdam]] in conjunction with [[Lufthansa]] and replacing [[Lufthansa CityLine]]. This follows the signing of a code-share agreement with Lufthansa in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bmi Regional|journal=Airliner World|date=March 2015|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2015 the service to Liège was cancelled, while new service to [[Brno–Tuřany Airport|Brno]] commenced.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flybmi.com/press-release/brno/&lt;/ref&gt; Since early 2016 a further Embraer 145 aircraft has been based in Munich in order to allow them to serve further routes from there bringing the total number to eight.

== Destinations ==
{{main|List of flybmi destinations}}
As a subsidiary of [[British Midland International]], the airline operated regional services for its parent. Since becoming independent of BMI, the airline has completed an entire network review which has resulted in numerous route and base closures along with the introduction of a number of new routes during 2012 and 2013.

flybmi operates scheduled services to over 27 destinations throughout [[Mainland Europe|continental Europe]] including [[Scandinavia]] and also [[United Kingdom]]. Commencing 30 March 2014, the start of the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] Northern Summer Season 2014, the airline operated a scheduled service on behalf of [[Brussels Airlines]] between [[Brussels Airport|Brussels]] and [[Bristol Airport|Bristol]]. Previously, Flybmi also operated a scheduled service on behalf of Brussels Airlines between Brussels and [[Newcastle Airport|Newcastle]].

At present, flybmi has [[Codeshare agreement|codeshare]] agreements in place with other airlines. flybmi operates codeshares with [[Lufthansa]] on its routes from Bristol to [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]] and on all of its routes to/from [[Munich Airport|Munich]]. It also operates a codeshare with Brussels Airlines from both [[East Midlands Airport]] and Newcastle to Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flybmi.com/en/bottom-menu/press/bmi-regional-trading-update-and-2014-outlook |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709041255/http://www.flybmi.com/en/bottom-menu/press/bmi-regional-trading-update-and-2014-outlook |archivedate=9 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

flybmi also operates regular holiday charter flights over the summer months. These destinations have include [[Bastia Airport|Bastia]] on the island of [[Corsica]] on behalf of specialist tour operator Corsican Places, from Bristol, and [[Verona Villafranca Airport|Verona]] from Bristol on behalf of another specialist tour operator Inghams. During 2011 Regional aircraft operated, on behalf of BMI, direct flights between [[Heathrow Airport]] and [[Beja Airport|Beja]] in the [[Alentejo]] region of [[Portugal]] for Sunvil Discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunvil.co.uk/news/beja-direct-flight|title=Latest travel news|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of July 2016 the airline announced an extension to its codeshare agreement with Brussels Airlines by adding seven new routes to its network. This has allowed flybmi to sell fares to Heathrow Airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flybmi.com/press-release/bmi-regional-extends-partnership-brussels-airlines/|title=BMI REGIONAL EXTENDS PARTNERSHIP WITH BRUSSELS AIRLINES - BMI Regional|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[Mark Getty]] and Chief Executive Officer [[Jonathan Klein (Getty Images)|Jonathan Klein]] co-founded Getty Investments LLC.  Mark Getty is the company's chairman. In September 1997, Getty Communications, as it was called at the time, merged with [[PhotoDisc|PhotoDisc, Inc.]] to form Getty Images. In April 2003, Getty Images entered into a partnership with [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP) to market each other's images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Getty Images and Agence France-Presse (AFP) Enter Into Partnership to Increase Breadth, Depth, Reach and Quality |date=April 1, 2003 |publisher=Getty Images |url=http://media.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=66 |access-date=November 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024125740/http://media.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=66 |archivedate=October 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the private equity firm [[Hellman &amp; Friedman]] (H&amp;F) acquired Getty Images. In 2012, H&amp;F put Getty up for sale.&lt;ref name="Bl01" /&gt; As of the ensuing sale to [[Carlyle Group]], the company was said to have an archive that included 80 million stills and illustrations.&lt;ref name="NYT01"&gt;[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/carlyle-in-3-3-billion-deal-for-getty-images/ "Carlyle in $3.3 Billion Deal for Getty Images"], ''New York Times'' Dealbook, August 15, 2012.

Since its formation, Getty Images has pursued an aggressive programme of [[takeover|acquisition]], buying up many privately owned agencies that had built up the stock photography industry, from small family-run firms to larger agencies. By 1999 it had acquired one of the largest agencies, Tony Stone Images; the online art seller Art.com; the sports photography agency [[Allsport]]; the market leader in the Benelux and Scandinavia: '''Word View''' (1996, from Mr. Bert Blokhuis, four offices, for undisclosed sum); journalistic specialists Liaison Agency; Newsmakers the first digital news photo agency; Online USA, a specialist in celebrity shots; and the [[Hulton Press Library]], the former archive of the British photojournalistic magazine ''Picture Post''. The Hulton collection was sold by the [[BBC]] to Brian Deutsch in 1988, when it was renamed Hulton Deutsch. In 1996, the Hulton collection was sold on once more, this time purchased by Getty Images and renamed Hulton Getty. With the acquisition of the Hulton library, Getty Images took ownership of the rights to some 15 million photographs from the British press archives dating back to the Nineteenth Century. Hulton Getty also included photographs from the [[Keystone View Company|Keystone Collection]], as well as images by notable photographers such as [[Bert Hardy]], [[Bill Brandt]], [[Weegee]] and [[Ernst Haas]].&lt;ref name="hulton_archive"&gt;{{cite web

In 2000, Getty acquired one of its main competitors, Archive Photos of New York (a division of [[The Image Bank]]), for US$183 million.&lt;ref name="image-ethics"/&gt; The Archive Photos library was combined with the Hulton Getty collection to form a new subsidiary, Hulton Archive. Archive Photos had been formed in 1990 from the merger of Pictorial Parade (est. 1935) and Frederick Lewis Stock Photos (est. 1938), two well-established US photo agencies. Their collections included archive images from ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Metronome magazine|Metronome]]'' and [[George Eastman House]], and works by photographers such as [[Ruth Orkin]], [[Anacleto Rapping]], Deborah Feingold, Murray Garrett, [[Nat Fein]] and [[John Filo]].&lt;ref name="hulton_archive"/&gt;

Getty Images also acquired other subsidiaries, including Master Delegates, which includes Isifa Image Service in [[Prague]] and Laura Ronchi in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Corporate ownership and management==
In February 2008, it was announced that Getty Images would be acquired by the private equity firm [[Hellman &amp; Friedman]] in a transaction valued at an estimated US$2.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=171 |title=Getty Images Press Release |date=February 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229030957/http://media.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=171 |archivedate=February 29, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2008, Getty Images announced the completion of its acquisition.  Getty Images common stock ceased trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] at the close of the acquisition and was delisted from the NYSE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://company.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=179&amp;isource=corporate_website_ind_press_release |title=Getty Images Announces Completion of Acquisition by Hellman &amp; Friedman |date=July 2, 2008 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630223723/http://company.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=179&amp;isource=corporate_website_ind_press_release |archivedate=June 30, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, H&amp;F engaged investment bankers to sell the company. While a price of $4 billion was initially discussed, in August when the private equity firm Carlyle Group emerged as the likely acquirer, the price under consideration was said to be $3.3–3.4 billion. [[CVC Capital Partners]] Ltd. was also said to have been bidding but had yet to top Carlyle's price.&lt;ref name=Bl01&gt;Alesci, Cristina, and Jeffrey McCracken, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-14/carlyle-group-said-to-be-leading-bidder-for-getty-images.html "Carlyle Group Said to Be Leading Bidder for Getty Images"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816010559/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-14/carlyle-group-said-to-be-leading-bidder-for-getty-images.html |date=August 16, 2012 }}, ''Bloomberg'', August 14, 2012. Retrieved August 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale to Carlyle thereafter was announced at $3.3 billion, with co-founders Getty and Klein and the Getty family all carrying their investments over into the new ownership structure. Getty continues to serve as chairman and Klein as chief executive.&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;

In September 2018, the Getty family announced it would acquire majority stake in the company from Carlyle Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/getty-images-ma/getty-family-to-buy-majority-stake-in-getty-images-from-carlyle-idUSL3N1VQ4JK|title=Getty family to buy majority stake in Getty Images from Carlyle|last=|first=|date=September 4, 2018|work=Reuters|access-date=September 4, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright enforcement and controversy==
[[File:Panorama of Stockholm with Getty Images watermark.jpg|thumb|500px|An image available at Getty Images, displaying a [[Digital watermarking|watermark]] with "Getty Images", the author's name, and a file-[[ID number]]. This watermark exists on all images on Getty Images when previewing the images, to prevent [[copyright infringement]].]]
Beginning in 2008, Getty Images has created controversy for its methods of pursuing copyright enforcement on behalf of its photographers. Rather than pursue a policy of sending "[[cease and desist]]" notices, Getty typically mails a [[demand letter]] that claims substantial monetary damages from owners of websites it believes infringed on their photographers' copyrights. Getty commonly tries to intimidate website owners by sending collection agents, even though a demand letter does not create a debt.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

One photographer noted, "Courts don't like to be used as a means of extortion."  In one case, Getty sent a church in [[Lichfield]], [[Staffordshire]], a £6,000 bill for photographs it used on its website, apparently placed there by a church volunteer.  In this case, the church offered to pay Getty what it thought was a reasonable amount. The [[diocese]]'s communications director said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Getty was not playing ball or following the normal litigation or [[dispute resolution]] procedures and [I advised the church] to ignore them. We don't deal with bullies; we deal with [[legal threat]]s appropriately. I told [Getty] by letter that's what [the church was] doing, that we were not going to play, and didn't hear any more.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' described other instances in which Getty or other stock photo businesses dropped a claim when a website owner refused to pay and hired a lawyer.  A law firm was quoted as saying: "Once we get involved generally Getty does back off."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Grossman, Wendy, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/nov/27/internet-photography "Is a picture really worth £1,000?"], ''The Guardian'', November 27, 2008. Retrieved November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Oscar Michelen, a New York attorney who focuses on such damages claims, said: "The damages they're requesting aren't equal to the copyright infringement," and "there's no law that says definitively what images are worth in the digital age."&lt;ref name="latimes1"&gt;{{cite news|date=September 13, 2009|first=David |last=Lazarus |authorlink=David Lazarus |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/13/business/fi-lazarus13 |title=Controlling illegal use of copyrighted material on the Web - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He called Getty's effort to assess four-figure fines "a legalized form of extortion".&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;

In an effort to combat online copyright infringement, in March 2014 Getty Images made over 35 million images available free for non-commercial online use via embedding with [[Attribution (copyright)|attribution]] and a link back to the Getty Images website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laurent |first=Olivier |title=Getty Images makes 35 million images free in fight against copyright infringement |url=http://www.bjp-online.com/2014/03/getty-images-makes-35-million-images-free-in-fight-against-copyright-infringement/ |date=March 5, 2014 |work=British Journal of Photography |accessdate=March 6, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306090832/http://www.bjp-online.com/2014/03/getty-images-makes-35-million-images-free-in-fight-against-copyright-infringement/ |archivedate=March 6, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brustein|first=Joshua|title=Since It Can't Sue Us All, Getty Images Embraces Embedded Photos|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-06/since-it-cant-sue-us-all-getty-images-embraces-embedded-photos|accessdate=March 7, 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Getty Images executive Craig Peters, "The principle is to turn what's infringing use with good intentions, turning that into something that's valid licensed use with some benefits going back to the photographer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brandom|first=Russell|title=The world's largest photo service just made its pictures free to use|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/5/5475202/getty-images-made-its-pictures-free-to-use|date=March 5, 2014|work=The Verge|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Getty Images entered a lawsuit with Google, taking issue with the way the search giant handled their images scraping methods. Two years later in 2018, Google removed the "View Image" button from their image search results. This led to outrage from users around the world, and a number of articles referencing this lawsuit. The button was removed as part of a settlement Google made with Getty Images.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/internet-rages-after-google-removes-view-image-button-bowing-to-getty/ Internet Rages After Google Removes "View Image" Button], ''Ars Technica''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright infringement lawsuits==
In 2009, Car-Freshner Corp. filed a lawsuit against Getty Images in [[U.S. Federal Court]], Northern District New York (Case 7:09-cv-01252-GTS -GHL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No. 7:09-CV-1252 (GTS/GHL)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=getty+images&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=40006&amp;case=3004682583920192380&amp;scilh=0|website=Google Scholar|publisher=United States District Court, N.D. New York.|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Car-Freshner claimed that Getty Images had in its catalog photos that included the famous "tree-shaped" trademarked car fresheners.  In 2011, Getty Images attempted to have the case dismissed, but its motion was denied.&lt;ref name="CourtroomStrategy2011"&gt;{{cite web |first=Oscar |last=Michelen |url=http://www.courtroomstrategy.com/2011/10/makers-of-pine-tree-deodorizers-allowed-to-proceed-with-lawsuit-against-getty-images/ |title=Makers of Pine-Tree Deodorizers Allowed to Proceed With Lawsuit Against Getty Images |publisher=Courtroomstrategy.com |date= October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Getty Images agreed to settle by paying $100,000 to Car-Freshener Corp., but admitted no wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="CourtroomStrategy2012"&gt;{{cite web |first=Oscar |last=Michelen |url= http://www.courtroomstrategy.com/2012/08/getty-images-pays-100k-to-settle-car-freshener-suit/ |title=Getty Images Pays $100K to Settle Car-Freshner Suit |publisher=Courtroomstrategy.com |date=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Avril Nolan brought a $450,000 suit against Getty Images. Nolan alleged that Getty Images improperly let her image be used in advertisements that depicted her as HIV-positive. She claimed the ad's depiction of her as HIV-positive (she is not) hurt her personal and professional relationships and caused her emotional distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://nypost.com/2013/09/19/woman-sues-getty-after-photo-appears-in-hiv-positive-ad/ | work=New York Post | first=Julia | last=Marsh | title = Model sues after HIV-positive ad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://observer.com/2013/09/greenpoint-model-tired-of-telling-dates-shes-hiv-free-sues-getty/ | work=The New York Observer | first= Órla | last= Ryan | date = September 20, 2013 | accessdate = April 22, 2014 | title = Greenpoint Model Tired of Telling Dates She's HIV Free Sues Getty}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014 a judge ruled the lawsuit will be taken to court rather than dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://nypost.com/2014/03/10/model-wins-round-in-hiv-ad-lawsuit/ | work=New York Post | first=Julia | last=Marsh | date = March 10, 2014 | accessdate = April 22, 2014 | title = Model wins round in HIV-ad lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getty Images settled with Nolan in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butler|first1=Office of Joy R.|title=More Lessons on How Not to Use Stock Images.

In November 2013, Getty and [[Agence France-Presse]] were ordered to pay $1.2 million compensation to freelance photojournalist Daniel Morel for using his images posted on [[Twitter]] related to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] without his permission, in violation of copyright and Twitter's terms of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ax|first=Joseph|title=Photographer wins $1.2 million from companies that took pictures off Twitter|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/22/us-media-copyright-twitter-idUSBRE9AL16F20131122|newspaper=Reuters|date=November 22, 2013|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Laurent |first=Olivier |title=Getty Images disappointed at $1.2m Morel verdict |url=http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/2308888/getty-images-disappointed-at-usd12m-morel-verdict |date=November 24, 2013 |work=British Journal of Photography |publisher=Incisive Media |accessdate=November 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126170747/http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/2308888/getty-images-disappointed-at-usd12m-morel-verdict |archivedate=November 26, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Getty was sued, unsuccessfully, for over $1 billion by [[Carol Highsmith]], an American photographer notable for donating her 100,000+ image collection, royalty-free, to the [[Library of Congress]], when Highsmith found that Getty has been selling unauthorized licenses of her work (an instance of [[copyfraud]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiltzik|first1=Michael|title=Photographer sues Getty Images for $1 billion after she's billed for her own photo|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-getty-copyright-20160729-snap-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate = August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highsmith-arstechnica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farivar|first1=Cyrus|title=Photographer sues Getty Images for selling photos she donated to public|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/07/photographer-sues-getty-images-for-selling-photos-she-donated-to-public/?comments=1|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=July 28, 2016|date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carol Highsmith found out about this when she received a letter from a law firm representing Getty demanding $120 for displaying her pictures on a personal website of hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiltzik|first1=Michael|title=Getty Images will bill you thousands to use a photo that belongs to the public.

In August 2016, [[Zuma Press]], an independent press agency, filed suit against Getty for alleged copyright violations and unauthorized licensing of more than 47,000 images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=hhttps://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/08/getty-images-sued-again-over-alleged-misuse-of-over-47000-photos/|title=Getty Images sued again over alleged misuse of over 47,000 photos|publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claiming copyright over public domain content ==
Getty Images has continued practice Corbis (whose license it acquired in 2016) has been criticized for, namely of claiming copyright, watermarking and selling images that are in public domain, including images related to The Holocaust like the [[Warsaw Ghetto boy]] photo&lt;ref name="Struk"&gt;{{cite book |last=Struk |first=Janina |date=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Photographing_the_Holocaust.html?id=P0CnKQpDIL8C |title=Photographing the Holocaust: Interpretations of the Evidence |publisher=I.B.Tauris |pages=208–209 |isbn=978-1-86064-546-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/frightened-jewish-families-surrender-to-nazi-soldiers-at-news-photo/613463274|title=Nazis Arresting Jews in Warsaw Ghetto|website=Getty Images|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Polish cavalry in Sochaczew photograph]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Battle of the Bzura.

==Prestige Grant==
The Getty Images Prestige Grant is awarded to two commercial photographers to realise a dream project, awarding them USD$15,000 and $7,500 respectively. The first recipients, in 2015, were [[Lisa Barnard]] and Andy Lo Po.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://imagery.gettyimages.com/getty_images_grants/Creative.html | accessdate = October 8, 2015 | publisher = Getty Images | title = Getty Images Creative Grants 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://press.gettyimages.com/getty-images-announces-recipients-of-new-prestige-grant/ | date = October 7, 2015 | accessdate = October 8, 2015 | publisher = Getty Images | title = Getty Images announces recipients of new Prestige Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12240">In the fields of [[information technology]] (IT) and [[systems management]], '''IT operations analytics (ITOA)''' is an approach or method to retrieve, analyze, and report data for IT operations. ITOA may apply [[big data analytics]] to large datasets to produce business insights.&lt;ref name="DataJournal"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Time Has Come: Analytics Delivers for IT Operations|url=http://www.datacenterjournal.com/it/time-analytics-delivers-operations/|publisher=Data Center Journal|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{citation|last=Fletcher|first=Colin|title=Apply IT Operations Analytics to Broader Datasets for Greater Business Insight|url=http://www.gartner.com/document/2778217|date=June 24, 2014|access-date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Gartner]] predicted its use might increase revenue or reduce costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IT operations analytics: Changing the IT perspective|url=http://www.information-age.com/technology/data-centre-and-it-infrastructure/123457805/it-operations-analytics-changing-it-perspective#sthash.qCUlOnyW.dpuf|publisher=Information Age|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, it predicted that 15% of enterprises will use IT operations analytics technologies.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;&lt;!-- so did they? --&gt;

==Definition==
IT operations analytics (ITOA) (also known as advanced operational analytics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Operations Analytics - What the Data Shows!|url=http://www.apmdigest.com/advanced-operations-analytics-what-the-data-shows|publisher=APM Digest |accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or IT data analytics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quintica offers BMC’s TrueSight
|url=http://it-online.co.za/2014/10/27/quintica-offers-bmcs-truesight/|publisher=IT-Online |accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  technologies are primarily used to discover complex patterns in high volumes of often "noisy" IT system availability and performance data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hype Cycle for IT Operations Management, 2013|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2556718/hype-cycle-it-operations-management|publisher=Gartner|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forrester Research]] defined IT analytics as "The use of mathematical algorithms and other innovations to extract meaningful information from the sea of raw data collected by management and monitoring technologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turn Big Data Inward With IT Analytics|url=https://www.forrester.com/Turn+Big+Data+Inward+With+IT+Analytics/fulltext/-/E-RES75501?objectid=RES75501|publisher=Forrester Research|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Operations research]] as a discipline emerged from the [[Second World War]] to improve military efficiency and decision-making on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA117 p. 117] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827004623/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA117 |date=27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only with the emergence of [[machine learning]] tech in the early 2000s could an [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] operational analytics platform actually begin to engage in the high-level [[pattern recognition]] that could adequately serve business needs.&lt;ref name="DataJournal" /&gt; A critical catalyst towards ITOA development was the rise of [[Google]], which pioneered a [[predictive analytics]] model that represented the first attempt to read into patterns of human behavior on the [[Internet]]. IT specialists then applied predictive analytics to the IT Industry, coming forward with platforms that can sift through data to generate insights without the need for human intervention.&lt;ref name="DataJournal" /&gt;

Due to the mainstream embrace of [[cloud computing]] and the increasing desire for businesses to adopt more [[Big Data]] practices, the ITOA industry has grown significantly since 2010. A 2016 ExtraHop survey of large and mid-size corporations indicates that 65 percent of the businesses surveyed will seek to integrate their [[data silos]] either this year or the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of the ITOA Today|url=https://assets.extrahop.com/pdfs/ebooks/State-of-ITOA-ebook.pdf|website=ExtraHop|publisher=ExtraHop|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current goals of ITOA platforms are to improve the accuracy of their [[Application Performance Management|APM]] services, facilitate better integration with the data, and to enhance their predictive analytics capabilities.

==Applications==
ITOA systems tend to be used by IT operations teams, and [[Gartner]] describes five applications of ITOA systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IT Market Clock for IT Operations Management, 2013 |url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2573216/it-market-clock-it-operations|publisher=Gartner|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Root Cause Analysis:'''  The models, structures and pattern descriptions of IT infrastructure or application stack being monitored can help users pinpoint fine-grained and previously unknown root causes of overall system behavior pathologies.
* '''Proactive Control of Service Performance and Availability:''' Predicts future system states and the impact of those states on performance.
* '''Problem Assignment:''' Determines how problems may be resolved or, at least, direct the results of inferences to the most appropriate individuals or communities in the enterprise for problem resolution.
* '''Service Impact Analysis:''' When multiple root causes are known, the  analytics system's output is used to determine and rank the relative impact, so that resources can be devoted to correcting the fault in the most timely and cost-effective way possible.
* '''Complement Best-of-breed Technology:''' The models, structures and pattern descriptions of IT infrastructure or application stack being monitored are used to correct or extend the outputs of other discovery-oriented tools to improve the fidelity of information used in operational tasks (e.g., service dependency maps, application runtime architecture topologies, network topologies).
* '''Real time application behavior learning:''' Learns &amp; correlates the behavior of Application based on user pattern and underlying Infrastructure on various application patterns, create metrics of such correlated patterns and store it for further analysis.
* '''Dynamically Baselines Threshold:''' Learns behavior of Infrastructure on various application user patterns and determines the Optimal behavior of the Infra and technological components, bench marks and baselines the low and high water mark for the specific environments and dynamically changes the bench mark baselines with the changing infra and user patterns without any manual intervention

==Types==
In their ''Data Growth Demands a Single, Architected IT Operations Analytics Platform'', [[Gartner]] Research describes five types of analytics technologies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Growth Demands a Single, Architected IT Operations Analytics Platform|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2599016/data-growth-demands-single-architected|publisher=Gartner|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Log analysis]]
* Unstructured text indexing, search and inference (UTISI)
* Topological analysis (TA)
* Multidimensional database search and analysis (MDSA)
* Complex operations event processing (COEP)
* Statistical pattern discovery and recognition (SPDR)

There are two main aspects of an AIOps platform: [[Machine learning]] and [[big data]]. In order to collect [[Observational study|observational data]] and engagement data that can be found inside a big data platform and requires a shift away from sectionally segregated IT data, a holistic machine learning and [[analytics|analytics strategy]] is implemented against the combined IT data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://devops.com/aiops-second-law-ops/|title=AIOps: Managing the Second Law of IT Ops - DevOps.com|date=22 September 2017|website=devops.com|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal is to receive continuous insights which provide [[Continual improvement process|continuous fixes and improvements]] via automation. This is why AIOps can be viewed as [[CI/CD]] for core IT functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://appdevelopermagazine.com/5047/2017/3/13/explaining-what-aiops-is-and-why-it-matters-to-developers/|title=Explaining what AIOps is and why it matters to developers|first=Richard|last=Harris|website=appdevelopermagazine.com|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://squadex.com/aiops-101/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4039">The '''International Qualification Examination''' ('''IQEX''') is an examination sat by certain non-U.S. qualified accountants seeking the [[Certified Public Accountant]] designation in the [[United States]].

The examination is set by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) and administered by the [[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy]] (NASBA).

==Eligibility==
In principle the following members of the following overseas bodies are eligible [http://www.nasba.org/international/iqex/]:

* [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia]]
* [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]]
* [[Chartered Accountants Ireland]]
* [[Instituto Mexicano de Contadores Publicos]]
* [[New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants]]
* [[Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants]]

Note: The Mutual Recognition Agreement between the U.S. International Qualifications Appraisal Board and CPA Australia (Australian Certified ''Practicing'' Accountants) has expired and is not being considered for renewal. Members of CPA Australia interested in becoming licensed as a CPA in the U.S. must complete the Uniform CPA Examination.

Those who have acquired their overseas membership through mutual recognition or reciprocity are not eligible.   For example, an Australian or Irish Chartered Accountant who originally qualified as a [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland|Scottish Chartered Accountant]] would not be eligible.

Those from recognized overseas bodies who are not eligible to sit for IQEX may apply to a U.S. State Board of Accountancy to sit for the Uniform CPA Exam under normal rules.  The ''Colorado State Board of Accountancy'', ''Delaware State Board of Accountancy'' and ''Illinois State Board of Accountancy'' are popular choices for overseas qualified accountants.

Details on IQEX eligibility, IQEX training programs and CPA licensure are available at [http://www.nasba.org/international/iqex/]

==Administration==
The administration of the IQEX exam is similar to that for the Uniform CPA Exam, with a few key differences:

* Application is made directly to NASBA, not to a state board of accountancy
* The exam can be sat at [[Prometric]] test centers outside the [[United States]] (although [[Canada]] is the only other country in which the exam is normally offered)
* Instead of being available all year round, IQEX is only offered for three weeks in October or November each year.
* Results are sent directly to the candidate by NASBA (normally in February, following the exam in November)

The fee to sit IQEX is USD845 as a first time candidate, and USD795 as a re-examination candidate.  Australian CPAs required to sit the AUD section of the Uniform CPA Exam must pay USD1,030 as a first time candidate, and USD795 for re-examination.   Should AUD be applied for on its own the fee is USD185.

==Licensure or certification as a CPA==
After successfully passing IQEX, candidates must still meet the requirements of one of the 55 State Boards of Accountancy in order to be licensed or certified as a CPA.

Although state boards are not involved in the IQEX examination itself, they still reserve the right to decide on CPA licensure and certification.

* Most successful IQEX candidates (who do not need a license from a particular state) apply for a ''CPA certificate'' from the ''Illinois State Board of Accountancy.''  This is the most straightforward option, as Illinois does not require any further educational, ethics or work experience requirements for certification.
* Some state boards do not accept IQEX, or only accept it under certain conditions.   Some may not accept Australian Chartered Accountants, for example, or may only accept Canadian Chartered Accountants from certain Canadian provinces.

* [[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy]]

==History==
===Founding===
In 1909, [[Eugène Schueller|Eugène Paul Louis Schueller]], a 
young [[French people|French]] [[chemist]] of [[Germany|German]] [[Ancestry|descent]],&lt;ref&gt;.[http://thefashionfoot.com/2013/02/18/eugene-schueller-founder-of-loreal/ The Fashion Foot.]&lt;/ref&gt; developed a hair dye formula called ''Auréale''. Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he then decided to sell to [[Paris]]ian hairdressers.
On 31 July 1919, Schueller registered his company,&lt;ref&gt;[https://prezi.com/a2vt6eplmrmn/corporate-financial-reporting/ Corporate financial reporting by Amberr Aslamm on Prezi]. Prezi.com. Retrieved on 12 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the Société Française de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The guiding principles of the company, which eventually became L'Oréal, were research and innovation in the field of beauty. In 1920, the company employed three chemists. By 1950, the team was 100 strong; that number reached 1,000 by 1984 and is nearly 82,000 today.

Schueller provided financial support and held meetings for [[La Cagoule]] at L'Oréal headquarters. La Cagoule was a violent French [[fascist]]-leaning and anti-[[communist]] group whose leader formed a political party [[Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire]] (MSR, Social Revolutionary Movement) which in Occupied France supported the Vichy collaboration with the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gladwell.com/2011/2011_03_28_a_color_of_money.html |title=The Color of Money |date=28 March 2011 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505045702/http://gladwell.com/2011/2011_03_28_a_color_of_money.html |archivedate=5 May 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; L'Oréal hired several members of the group as executives after [[World War II]], such as [[Jacques Corrèze]], who served as [[CEO]] of the [[United States]] operation. This involvement was extensively researched by [[Michael Bar-Zohar]] in his book, ''Bitter Scent''.

L'Oréal got its start in the hair-colour business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products. L'Oréal currently markets over 500 brands and thousands of individual products in all sectors of the beauty business: hair colour, permanents, [[Hairstyle|hair styling]], body and skin care, [[Cleanser|cleansers]], makeup and fragrance. The company's products are found in a wide variety of distribution channels, from hair salons and perfumeries to hyper - and supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies and direct mail.

===Research and development facilities===
L'Oréal has six worldwide [[research and development]] centres: two in France: [[Aulnay-sous-Bois|Aulnay]] and [[Chevilly-Larue|Chevilly]]; one in the [[United States|U.S.]]: [[Clark, New Jersey|Clark]], [[New Jersey]]; one in [[Japan]]: [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]; in 2005 one was established in [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], and one in [[India]]. A future facility in the US will be in [[Berkeley Heights, New Jersey]].

===Media===
From 1988 to 1989, L'Oréal controlled the film company [[Paravisión|Paravision]], whose properties included the [[Filmation]] and [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group|De Laurentiis]] libraries. [[StudioCanal]] acquired the Paravision properties in 1994.

==Acquisitions==
L'Oréal purchased Synthélabo in 1973 to pursue its ambitions in the pharmaceutical field. Synthélabo merged with [[Sanofi]] in 1999 to become [[Sanofi-Synthélabo]].  Sanofi-Synthélabo merged with [[Aventis]] in 2004 to become [[Sanofi-Aventis]].

On 17 March 2006, L'Oréal purchased cosmetics company [[The Body Shop]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]562 million.

L'Oréal's [[advertising slogan]] is "Because I'm worth it". In the mid 2000s, this was replaced by "Because you're worth it". In late 2009, the slogan was changed again to "Because we're worth it" following motivation analysis and work into consumer psychology of Dr. Maxim Titorenko. The shift to "we" was made to create stronger consumer involvement in L'Oréal philosophy and lifestyle and provide more consumer satisfaction with L'Oréal products. L'Oréal also owns a Hair and Body products line for kids called [[L'Oréal Kids]], the slogan for which is "Because we're worth it too".

==Marketing==
In 1987, during the growth years of the mail order business, L'Oréal and [[3 Suisses]]  founded Le Club des Créateurs de Beauté for mail-order sales of cosmetic products, with brands including Agnès b., Cosmence and Professeur Christine Poelman among others.  In March 2008, L'Oréal acquired 3 Suisse's stake, taking sole control of the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Business-Financial/L-Oreal-buys-stake-in-beauty-brand "L'Oreal buys stake in beauty brand"], ''Cosmetics Design Asia''. Retrieved on 13 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, L'Oréal announced that Le Club des Créateurs de Beauté would cease activity in the first half of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/l-oreal-to-end-the-activity-of,6187|title=L'Oréal to end the activity of Beauté Créateurs its mail-order subsidiary|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, L'Oréal inaugurated the largest factory in the [[Cikarang|Jababeka Industrial Park, Cikarang]], Indonesia, with a total investment of US$100 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/slideshows/day-in-pics/november-08-2012/loreal-opens-largest-factory-in-cikarang/slideshow/17140910.cms "L'Oreal opens largest factory in Cikarang"], ''The Economic Times'', India, 8 November 2012. Retrieved on 13 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The production will be absorbed 25 percent by domestic market and the rest will be exported. In 2010, significant growth occurred at Indonesia with 61 percent increase of unit sales or 28 percent of net sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?id=17498&amp;sec=2 L'Oreal to build its largest factory worth $50m in Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other acquisitions===
In January 2014, L'Oréal finalised the acquisition of major [[China|Chinese]] beauty brand Magic Holdings for $840 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/loreal-acquires-chinese-beauty-brand-magic-holdings-for-840m L'Oréal Acquires Major Chinese Beauty Brand]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2014 it was announced that L'Oreal had sealed a deal worth €3.4bn to buy back 8% of its shares from Swiss consumer goods giant Nestle. As a result of the deal, Nestle's stake in L'Oreal will be reduced from 29.4pc to 23.29pc while the Bettencourt Meyers family's stake will increase from 30.6pc to 33.2pc. Nestle has owned a stake in L'Oreal since 1974 when it bought into the company at the request of [[Liliane Bettencourt]], the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal and world's richest woman, who was trying to prevent the French state's intervention in the company.

On 20 February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decléor brands to L'Oréal for €227.5 million (US$312.93 million (2014)).&lt;ref name="Shiseido Sells Carita, Decléor to L'Oréal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/financial/shiseido-sells-carita-declor-to-loral-7487620?src=n/newsAlert/20140219-7 | title=Shiseido Sells Carita, Decléor to L'Oréal | publisher=WWD | date=19 February 2014 | accessdate=20 February 2014 | author=Kaiser, Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 June 2014, L'Oréal agreed to acquire [[NYX Cosmetics]] for an undisclosed price, bolstering its makeup offer in [[North America]] where its consumer-products unit has faltered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-06-18/l-oreal-agrees-to-acquire-u-dot-s-dot-makeup-artist-brand-nyx-cosmetics|title=L'Oreal Agrees to Buy U.S. Makeup-Artist Brand NYX Cosmetics|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, L'Oréal announced it had agreed to purchase [[Brazil]]ian hair care company Niely Cosmeticos Group for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=Reuters| date=8 September 2014| title=L'Oreal to buy Brazilian hair care group Niely Cosmeticos | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/08/us-l-oreal-m-a-brazil-idUSKBN0H30EN20140908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate social responsibility===

====Group-wide sustainability plan====
L'Oreal announced a new sustainability plan in 2013, which they hope will help reach the goal of 1 billion new consumers by 2020 by producing more products with less environmental impact and helping customers make sustainable lifestyle choices. The main commitments to achieve by 2020 include: aiming for 100 percent of its products to have an environmental or social benefit; reducing the company's environmental footprint by 60 percent; and empowering consumers to make sustainable consumption choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/news/loral-outlines-2020-sustainability-goals/4008356.article|title=L'Oréal Outlines 2020 Sustainability Goals|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sustainable development====
In 2009, L'Oréal declared their intention to cut greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption and waste by 50% over the period 2005-2015 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2009/04/23/loreal-to-reduce-ghg-emissions-water-consumption-and-waste-by-50/|title= L'Oreal to Reduce GHG Emissions, Water Consumption and Waste by 50%|publisher= Environmental Leader|date= 23 April 2009|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a deduction in carbon dioxide emissions that is to be in part achieved by the use of solar panels, biogas and electricity and hot water produced from the combustion of methane gas recovered from agricultural waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.fashionmag.com/news/L-Oreal-wants-to-cut-its-CO2-emissions-in-half-by-2015,60830.html#.UimqX9K8Bag|title= L'Oréal wants to cut its CO2 emissions in half by 2015|publisher= Fashionmag.com|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the company declared a 37.1% deduction in C02 Emissions, a 24% deduction in water consumption and a 22% deduction in transportable waste, and was named a sector leader by [[Climate Counts]] for its practices and achievements in the management of carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/34964-L-Or-al-Recognized-by-Climate-Counts-as-Sector-Leader-for-Managing-Reporting-and-Reducing-its-Carbon-Emissions| title= L'Oréal Recognized by Climate Counts as Sector Leader for Managing, Reporting and Reducing its Carbon Emissions |publisher= CSR Wire|date= 5 December 2012|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014, L'Oréal made the commitment to ensure that none of its products were linked to deforestation, and to source 100% renewable raw materials by 2020.&lt;ref name=cosmeticsdesigneurope&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Business-Financial/L-Oreal-reiterates-sustainability-importance-with-zero-deforestation-commitment| title= L'Oréal reiterates sustainability importance with ‘zero deforestation' commitment |publisher= Cosmetics design-europe.com|date= 15 January 2014|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was included in the Corporate Knights "Global 100" list of the 100 most sustainable companies.&lt;ref name=cosmeticsdesigneurope/&gt;

====Position on animal testing====
Since the 80s, L'Oréal has invested €900 million in researching [[alternatives to animal testing]] for product safety, using methods such as reconstructed skin models, like the Episkin model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Formulation-Science/L-Oreal-builds-on-skin-testing-capabilities |title=L'Oreal builds on skin testing capabilities|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at their research centers in Gerland, France, and [[Pudong]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://answers.loreal.com/animaltesting/en/our-position/|title=Our Position|publisher=L'Oréal Answers|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, this is complicated by markets such as China,&lt;ref name=bweekchina&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-08-21/china-animal-testing-complicates-l-oreal-s-expansion-retail|title=China Animal Testing Complicates L'Oreal's Expansion|date=21 August 2013|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where animal testing of all cosmetics for human use is mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2181468/Big-beauty-brands-dropping-cruelty-free-animal-testing-policies-sell-products-China.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=L'Occitane and Yves Rocher: The big-name beauty brands among those ditching cruelty-free animal testing policies to sell their products to China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmetics by brands such as [[The Body Shop]], which refuses to do [[animal testing]], are thus not available for sale in the Chinese market.

In 2013, L'Oréal was part of a consortium calling on the EU to invest more in research on alternatives to animal testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/18/animal-testing-talk-about-medical-research|title=Animal testing – it's time to talk about it again|author=Bibi van der Zee|publisher=The Guardian|date=18 July 2013|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community involvement and awards===
In 2014, L'Oreal was listed 61st among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the [[The Brand Trust Report|Brand Trust Report]] 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trustadvisory.info/allindia_2014.html |title=India's Most Trusted Brands 2014 |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502221904/http://www.trustadvisory.info/allindia_2014.html |archivedate= 2 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, L'Oréal was named Europe's top business employer by the European Student Barometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trendence.de/fileadmin/pdf/ESB_2008.pdf|title=The European Student Barometer 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a survey conducted by Trendence that covers 20 European countries and incorporates the responses of over 91,000 students.

The [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]] was established to improve the position of women in science by recognizing outstanding women researchers who have contributed to scientific progress.

The awards are a result of a partnership between the French cosmetics company L'Oréal and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) and carry a grant of $100,000 USD for each laureate.

The same partnership awards the UNESCO-L'Oréal International Fellowships, providing up to $40,000 USD in funding over two years to fifteen young women scientists engaged in exemplary and promising research projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=14633&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html/ UNESCO/L'ORÉAL Co-Sponsored Fellowships for Young Women in Life Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010122943/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D14633%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |date=10 October 2014 }}. Portal.unesco.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

L'Oréal organises the yearly L'Oréal Brandstorm, a business game for students in 43 countries. The game is related to marketing and has a first prize of $10,000, a second prize of $5,000 and a third prize of $2500.

L'Oréal is also a founding member of the "Look Good...Feel Better" project, a charity which was formed over 16 years ago to help women combat the visible side effects of cancer treatment.

In 2015, [[Standard Ethics Aei]] gave a rating to L'Oreal in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standardethicsindices.eu/standard-ethics-french-index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403113833/http://standardethicsindices.eu/standard-ethics-french-index.html |archivedate=3 April 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and innovation==

===Episkin===
Episkin is a reconstructed skin model developed by engineers at L'Oréal France to provide an alternatives to animal testing.&lt;ref name="Skin Replaces Animal Tests"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Animal%20Testing/SkinReplacesAnimTests.htm | work= Animal Liberation Front|title= Human Skin to Replace Animal Tests|date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human [[skin cells]] left over from breast surgery &lt;ref name="Skin Replaces Animal Tests" /&gt; are developed under [[in vitro]] laboratory conditions to form sheets of reconstructed skin.&lt;ref name="Build on Animal Testing"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Formulation-Science/L-Oreal-builds-on-skin-testing-capabilities | work=Cosmetic Design Europe| title=L'Oréal Builds on Skin Testing Capabilities| date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has advantages over animal testing other than the sparing of animals: it can be adapted to create reconstructions of a range of skin colours, as well as younger and older skin, meaning that safety tests give more relevant results for humans.&lt;ref name="Build on Animal Testing" /&gt;
In 2006, the Episkin division acquired SkinEthic, a leading [[tissue engineering]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.euroinvestor.fr/actualites/2006/02/28/loreal-episkin-subsidiary-of-loreal-acquires-skinethic-leader-in-tissue-engineering/9331794 | work=Euro Investor| title=L´OREAL : EPISKIN, SUBSIDIARY OF L´OREAL, ACQUIRES SKINETHIC, LEADER IN TISSUE ENGINEERING| date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim for L'Oréal is to produce products that cater to their diverse customers specifically, in the emerging markets that currently account for 53% of the entire global beauty market.&lt;ref name="GCI"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.gcimagazine.com/business/management/innovation/111854374.html?page=1| work=GCI| title=L'Oréal Unveils New Research and Innovation Strategy| date=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these research methods L'Oréal aims to tap into one billion new consumers &lt;ref name="GCI" /&gt; in these markets for the upcoming years.

In 2003, the L'Oréal Institute for Ethnic Hair &amp; Skin Research was inaugurated in Chicago to continue their research on African American hair and skin among other ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/2012/11/09/4th-loreal-workshop-on-african-hair-and-skin-currently-underway/| work=LIFESTYLE Mahazine| title=4th L'Oreal workshop on African hair and skin currently underway | date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The L'Oréal Group opened ''the Predictive Evaluation Center'' in Lyon, France in 2011.

In 2011, L'Oréal announced its intention to build a ''Research and Innovation Center'' in Bom Jesus Island Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]]. Estimated at 30 million euros (70,000,000 reals), this project is expected to create about 150 jobs by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/l-oreal-a-new-research-and,3682| work=Premium Beauty News| title=L'Oréal: a new research and innovation centre in Rio| date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The L'Oreal Global Hair Research Centre, a facility in Paris Saint-Ouen opened in March 2012. It serves as the headquarters for the international departments of hair color, hair care and hair styling. One of the largest investments in company R&amp;I history, the 25,000m² Centre hosts 500 employees. These include chemists, physico-chemists, opticians, materials scientists, metrologists, rheologists, computer scientists and statisticians.

===Human skin 3D printing===
L'Oreal announced in May 2015 that it was partnering with bioprinting startup [[Organovo]] to figure out how to 3D print living, breathing derma that can be used to test products for toxicity and efficacy. "We're the first beauty company that Organovo has worked with," said Guive Balooch, global vice president of L'Oreal's tech incubator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-18/l-oreal-s-plan-to-start-3d-printing-human-skin| work=Bloomberg| title=L'Oreal's Plan to Start 3D Printing Human Skin| date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modiface===
On 16 March 2018, L'Oréal announced that it had acquired Modiface, a beauty tech company that uses [[augmented reality]] to allow users to digitally try on different makeup products and hairstyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17131260/loreal-modiface-acquire-makeup-ar-try-on|title=L’Oreal acquires Modiface, a major AR beauty company|work=The Verge|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==

===Advertising===
In May 2007, L'Oréal was one of several cosmetic manufacturers (along with Clinique, Estee Lauder, Payot, Lancôme)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Beauty and the publicity beast|date = 9 May 2007|last = Costello|first = John|work = The Evening Herald|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-163157135.html|accessdate = 14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ordered by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] in Australia to withdraw advertising regarding the [[wrinkle (skin)|wrinkle]] removal capabilities of their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wrinkle creams are a rip-off|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,21682971-36557,00.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]|date=7 May 2007|accessdate=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, L'Oréal has faced criticism from [[OFCOM]] regarding the truth of their advertising and marketing campaigns concerning the product performance of one of their mascara brands. In July 2007, the British [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] attacked L'Oréal for a television advert on its "Telescopic" [[mascara]], featuring [[Penélope Cruz]], stating, "it will make your [[eyelash]]es 60% longer." In fact, it only made the lashes look 60% bigger, by separating and thickening at the roots and by thickening the tips of the lashes. They also failed to state that the model was wearing [[Eyelash extensions|false eyelash]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_42910.htm |title=L'Oréal (UK) Ltd |publisher=Asa.org.uk |date=25 July 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the British Advertising Standards Authority took action against L'Oréal, banning two airbrushed [[Lancôme]] advertisements in the UK featuring actress [[Julia Roberts]] and supermodel [[Christy Turlington]]. The agency issued the ban after British politician [[Jo Swinson]] argued that the two ads misrepresented reality and added to the self-image problem amongst females in the UK. L'Oréal acknowledged that the photos had been airbrushed but argued that the two cosmetic products could actually produce the results depicted in the ads and that the results of the products had been scientifically proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/07/28/airbrushed.advertisements.ban/index.html?&amp;hpt=hp_c2 |title=Britain bans airbrushed Julia Roberts make-up ad |publisher=CNN |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014 the company reached agreement with the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] not to make claims about its anti-aging products unless it had credible scientific evidence supporting the claims. The settlement followed an investigation by the commission into claims being made in relation to two products, which the commission described as "false and unsubstantiated."

L'Oréal has a team of 400 members of staff who post content to [[Facebook]] every day, according to Marc Menesguen, the company's chief marketing officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2013/05/facebook-future-mark-zuckerberg-sheryl-sandberg A Facebook of the Future: Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg Show Us Their New Content, New Algorithms, and New Alliances | Vanity Fair&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human resources===
On 11 August 2005, the [[Supreme Court of California]] ruled that former L'Oréal sales manager Elyse Yanowitz had adequately pleaded a cause of action for retaliatory termination under the [[California Fair Employment and Housing Act]], and remanded the case for trial.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Yanowitz v. L'Oréal USA, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/36C4t1028.htm 36 Cal. 4th 1028] (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The case arose out of a 1997 incident in which Jack Wiswall, then the general manager for designer fragrances, allegedly told Yanowitz to fire a [[Person of color|dark-skinned]] sales associate despite the associate's good performance. When Yanowitz refused, Wiswall pointed to a "sexy" blonde-haired woman and said "God damn it, get me one that looks like that."  Wiswall retired as president of the luxury products division of L'Oréal USA at the end of 2006.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The company has recently faced discrimination lawsuits in France related to the hiring of spokesmodels and [[institutional racism]]. In July 2007, the [[Garnier]] division and an external employment agency were fined €30,000 for recruitment practices that intentionally excluded non-white women from promoting its hair wash, "Fructis Style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soxfirst.com/50226711/loreal_found_guilty_of_racism.php |title=L'Oreal found guilty of racism |publisher=Sox First |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; L'Oréal is reported as saying the decision was "incomprehensible",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaresource.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=425:loreal-tells-women-of-color-to-take-a-hike&amp;catid=136:race&amp;Itemid=351 |title=L'Oreal Tells Women of Color to Take a Hike - AfricaResource: The Place for Africa on the Net |publisher=AfricaResource |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would challenge the measure in court.

In August 2017, L'Oréal dismissed Munroe Bergdorf, a [[mixed-race]] [[transgender]] model, after she responded to the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] by stating in a [[Facebook]] post that racism is institutionalized in society by white people. Shortly after terminating Bergdorf, L'Oréal released a statement reaffirming their commitment to "[support] diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion" and had terminated their partnership with Bergdorf because her comments were "at odds with those values."&lt;ref name="theguardianonthelorealcismrow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iqbal|first1=Nosheen|title=Munroe Bergdorf on the L’Oréal racism row: ‘It puzzles me that my views are considered extreme’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/sep/04/munroe-bergdorf-on-the-loreal-racism-row-it-puzzles-me-that-my-views-are-considered-extreme|accessdate=5 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimeslorealdropstransgendermodel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fortin|first1=Jacey|title=L’Oréal Drops Transgender Model Over Comments on Race|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/business/munroe-bergdorf-loreal-transgender.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0|accessdate=5 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal testing==
L'Oréal pays companies to test on animals for the China market &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.peta.org/living/beauty/beauty-brands-that-you-thought-were-cruelty-free-but-arent/ | title = These Beauty Brands Are Still Tested on Animals | publisher = [[PETA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as China requires cosmetics companies perform animal testing in government labs before regulators approve products for sale. 
All brands that import products to sell in China must animal test. In CNBC's 2017 article, "In China, Big Cosmetic Firms are Selling Products Tested on Animals," the author reached out to L'Oréal for a comment but they didn't respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/19/in-china-big-cosmetics-firms-are-selling-products-tested-on-animals.html | title = In China, big cosmetics firms are selling products tested on animals | publisher = [[CNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[Eugène Schueller]], the company's founder, was an alleged [[Nazi]] sympathizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/03/18/cz_sh_0318oreal_bill05.html | work=Forbes | title=Father's Past Haunts French Billionaire | date=18 March 2005 | first=Suzanne | last=Hoppough}}&lt;/ref&gt; L'Oréal concedes that Schueller was an [[anti-Semitic]] [[fascist]].&lt;ref name="Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,157348,00.html | work=Time | title=Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's | date=24 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a member of [[La Cagoule]], which supported the [[Vichy regime]], and was a violent, pro-fascist and anti-communist organization.  Eugène bankrolled La Cagoule and some meetings of [[La Cagoule]] were held at L'Oréal headquarters. Some of the criminal activities perpetrated by La Cagoule include firearms transportation, assassinating a former minister, and firebombing six synagogues.&lt;ref name="André Bettencourt"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1570119/Andre-Bettencourt.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=André Bettencourt | date=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pascal"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/loreal-took-my-home-by-monica-waitzfelder-translated-by-peter-bush-432358.html |title= L'Oreal Took My Home, by Monica Waitzfelder, translated by Peter Bush| location=London | work=The Independent | first=Julia | last=Pascal | date=16 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other controversy arose when [[Jean Frydman]], a shareholder and board member of Paravision, a film subsidiary of L'Oréal, was fired. He claims that he was let go because L'Oréal wanted to avoid an Arab boycott of businesses associated with Jews. In turn, Frydman decided to expose the past of L'Oréal executives. [[André Bettencourt]] who married Schueller's daughter, [[Liliane Bettencourt]], and became deputy chairman for L'Oréal, wrote 60 articles for La Terre Française. La Terre Française was an anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda sheet. André has admitted ownership of the [[propaganda]] but claimed he was poisoned by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime and said, "I have repeatedly expressed my regrets concerning them in public and will always beg the Jewish community to forgive me for them."&lt;ref name="André Bettencourt"/&gt; André Bettencourt also sheltered Schueller and several collaborators from the [[French Resistance]] after Liberation.&lt;ref name="Pascal"/&gt; It was also revealed that Eugène Schueller hired [[Jacques Correze]], who was the honorary head of L'Oréal's U.S. affiliate, Cosmair, and was involved with [[La Cagoule]].&lt;ref name="Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's"/&gt;

Further controversy arose when it was revealed that L'Oréal had its German headquarters for over 30 years, before being sold in 1991, on land confiscated from a Jewish family during [[World War II]]. The Jewish family has been battling for restitution from the company for three generations, the latest of which is Edith Rosenfelder, a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor. Fritz Rosenfelder, was forced to sell the house to a Nazi official, of which the family never received the proceeds of the sale. Instead, the family was deported. The Allies passed Jewish restitution legislation which states that transactions with Nazis, even if appearing to be with the owner's consent, can be considered invalid. As the land was sold to an offshoot of L'Oréal, which was later bought out in 1961 by L'Oréal, the company claims that it is not responsible for anything that happened before then. The basis for Rosenfelder's argument is that since the original sale was illegal, all subsequent sales are equally unlawful. There was restitution paid in 1951 to the [[Jewish Restitution Successor Organization]], though this was done without the family's consent and none of the money ever reached the family. A book by Monica Waitzfelder, daughter of Edith Rosenfelder, published in French as ''L'Oréal a pris ma maison'' and in English as ''L'Oréal stole my house!'', details how L'Oréal, took over the Waitzfelder home in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Karlsruhe]] (after the Nazis had engineered the removal of the family) to make it its German headquarters.&lt;ref name="Gentleman"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/13/secondworldwar.germany | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Amelia | last=Gentleman | title=L'Oréal profited from victims of Nazis, court told | date=13 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Monica Waitzfelder is quoted as saying, "All the other businesses which took Jewish property have since returned it, without any great debate. I don't understand why L'Oréal should be any different from the others." A case was brought before the Supreme Court in France, but the public prosecutor ruled that there could be no trial.  As of 2007, she is bringing the case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="Pascal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentleman"/&gt;

Following L'Oréal's 2006 purchase of [[The Body Shop]], which does not support [[animal testing]], The Body Shop's founder [[Anita Roddick]] was forced to defend herself against allegations of abandoning her principles over L'Oréal's track record on animal testing. Calls were made for shoppers to boycott The Body Shop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100424192639/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/anitas-163652m-sellout-470379.html "Anita's £652m sell-out"], ''The Independent'' (London). 18 March 2006.

The '''Malaysia International Islamic Financial Centre''' ('''MIFC''') is an initiative of [[Malaysia|Malaysia’s]] financial market regulators and relevant government agencies dedicated to developing Malaysia’s [[Islamic banking and finance|Islamic finance]] market by engaging with industry and government.&lt;ref&gt;Law Kai Chow (12 August 2008).

Sukuk were also issued denominated in foreign currencies including the world’s first Japanese Yen sukuk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/05/bankoftokyomitsubishi-sukuk-idUKL3N0OM20120140605|title=UPDATE 1-Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ sets up $500 mln sukuk...|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|date=|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2014/09/25/BTMU-issues-worlds-first-yen-dominated-emas-sukuk/?style=biz|title=BTMU issues world's first Yen-dominated "Emas" sukuk - Business News - The Star Online|author=|date=|website=Thestar.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, a total of 114 sukuk tranches were domiciled in the Malaysian sukuk market in 3Q14.

The "Emas" designation is given to foreign-currency denominated sukuk issues. "[[Emas bond|Emas]]", which means gold in Bahasa Malaysia symbolized universal value and security.

==Growing Islamic Banking and Takaful Sectors==
The Malaysian Islamic financial sector continues its growth trajectory, with robust growth in Islamic banking assets and takaful assets. The Islamic Banking sector in Malaysia has witnessed an increased market share on the back of growing demand for Islamic financial services.

Islamic banking has grown twice as fast in Malaysia as its conventional counterpart at a compounded annual growth rate of 22%, representing 24% to 25%% of total banking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2014/03/12/Robust-Islamic-banking-Its-on-track-to-make-up-40-of-countrys-banking-sector-assets-by-2020/?style=biz|title=Islamic banking  on track to make up 40% of Malaysia's banking sector assets - Business News - The Star Online|author=|date=|website=Thestar.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country is domicile to 11 takaful operators, two of which are foreign owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnm.gov.my/index.php?ch=li&amp;cat=insurance&amp;type=TKF&amp;fund=0&amp;cu=0|title=List of Licensed Financial Institutions in Malaysia - Bank Negara Malaysia - Central Bank of Malaysia|author=|date=|website=Bnm.gov.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of growth in the takaful industry has been gaining traction to become one of the main segments of the country's insurance sector.

Retakaful operators in Malaysia add an extra layer of depth to the takaful industry through the spreading of risk and added capacity so that more risk can be underwritten.

==Vibrant and Innovative Islamic Equity Market==
Malaysia’s Islamic finance marketplace has an efficient and transparent price discovery infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesscircle.com.my/islamic-finance-malaysia-can-stay-ahead/|title=businesscircle.com.my|author=|date=|website=Businesscircle.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fund raising and investment activities in the Islamic capital market adhere to Islamic principles. Islamic equity market products in Malaysia include Shariah-compliant equities, Shariah-compliant collective investment schemes (unit trust funds, wholesale funds, I-REITs, I-ETFs), structured products, alternative funds(real estate, leasing, commodities) private equity funds and mixed asset (equity + fixed income + cash).

73% of total listed securities on Bursa Malaysia are Shariah-compliant.&lt;ref name="sc.com.my"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.com.my/post_archive/updated-list-of-shariah-compliant-securities-by-scs-shariah-advisory-council-12/|title=Updated List of Shariah-compliant Securities by SC's Shariah Advisory CouncilSecurities Commission Malaysia - Securities Commission Malaysia|author=|date=|website=Sc.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated list of Shariah-compliant securities approved by its [[Shariah Advisory Council]] (SAC), which takes effect on 30 May 2014, features a total of 665 Shariah-compliant securities.&lt;ref name="sc.com.my"/&gt;

Malaysia had different asset classed to suit various investor needs. The industry in Malaysia grew from two Shariah-compliant unit trust funds in 1993 to more than 220 approved funds. Malaysia’s Islamic fund management industry with RM97.5bil in assets under management,&lt;ref name="thestar.com.my"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2014/05/01/Msian-Islamic-capital-market-now-worth-RM15-trillion/?style=biz|title=Malaysian Islamic capital market now worth RM1.5 trillion - Business News - The Star Online|author=|date=|website=Thestar.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is managed by 20 asset management companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.com.my/wp-content/uploads/eng/html/licensing/LoLI/LIFM.pdf|format=PDF|title=List of Capital Markets Services Licence holders for Islamic Fund Management as at 30 November 2014|website=Sc.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; licensed to exclusively manage shariah-compliant funds. Of the total assets under management, RM42bil is in the form of syariah-compliant unit trust funds which grew by 21% in 2013.&lt;ref name="thestar.com.my"/&gt;

==Talent Development - Sustaining the growth of Islamic Finance==
The growth of Islamic finance in the past decade has been extraordinary. As the industry expands into untapped markets, there is a need to develop new talent that understands the industry and its underlying Shariah principles to support this growth. In response, Malaysia has undertaken initiatives to support the development of a highly skilled Islamic finance human capital workforce.

'''Michel de Kemmeter''' (born {{Birth date|df=yes|1964|09|29}}) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[entrepreneur]], real estate investor and [[author]] from [[Ghent]]. He started in the field of specialized renovation. Since 2005 he researches and writes about [[personal development]], [[intangible assets]] and [[Social sustainability|human sustainable development]]. Today he is an expert in economic transition.

==Early life and career==

Michel de Kemmeter attended the [[Ghent University|Rijksuniversiteit Gent]] University in Belgium. Later on, he attended the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] for the degree in [[Sales engineering|Sales Engineer]]. His works were published in [[French language]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]].

His first published books were reference books on construction materials, such as natural stone, [[Bluestone|blue stone]] and [[wood]]. In this field of work, he has started a business specialized on treatment and solutions to pathology of natural stone and chemistry/physics of the stone after installation.

In 1996 he has started to [[Investment|invest]] on [[Real estate|Real Estate]] in Belgium and since then has been sharing experiences as investor in private housing with ''Fortune de Briques'' at Éditions Racine.

==Human development work==

In 2001 he worked on the "Motivation Wheel", a [[psychological]] tool for a circular analysis of [[Human nature|human characteristics]], such as [[behavior]], [[values]], [[Worry|concerns]], [[needs]] and [[Desire (emotion)|desires]] for inner fulfillment. This work explained about an interpretative framework for connecting "doing" and "being" through aspirations, fears and internal strengths. The model was designed to be used for corporate aspects, such as [[Organizational culture|corporate culture development]], [[Time management|time management and values]], evaluation of [[intangible assets]], [[coaching]] and individual's [[mentoring]]. The 7D-Value approach, based on the 7 levels of value is also used to map excellence and potential of individuals.

Later, in 2005, he published the book "The Value of Time" and the "Die Werte der Zeit" edition by the publisher Swinti Verlag GmbH, and "La Valeur du Temps" in 2006 by Éditions Racine. The book was a work of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] applied to [[management]] and life. It gave a different perspective to the Greek nations of ''[[chronos]]'', ''[[kairos]]'' and ''[[Aiôn|aion]]'' in a way to find openness of self to life. Today, he is a consultant and trainer of this subject at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|Free University of Brussels]] and at the University of [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] (Louvain School of Management).

==Present==

De Kemmeter has started in 2006 a [[Business networking|network]] of reflection and [[innovation]] on [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and societal development, named UHDR (Universal Human Development and Research). This network of collaborators has been creating tools for development of human potential, self-connection and experiential conscious mentoring, in collaboration with medics, sportsmen, companies, universities, philosophers and therapists.

Some works of the network were "[[7D-Value]]" (for purpose, knowledge, communication, processes and emotional balance sheets within companies), and "Culture Coherence" (approaching circles of coherence in organizations). These tools aim to give assessments of perceived [[corporate identity]], [[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]] relative to competitors, values, strengths and development areas, assessment and quantification of intangible assets, [[Customer satisfaction|customers satisfaction]], and a consistency's degree of the company.

In 2008, he has founded UniverseCité UHDR (UHDR UniverseCity) of [[Sustainable Human Development]], which has the goal of bringing "soft skills development" based on concepts of collective intelligence and [[Experiential learning|experimental learning]]. In his research, he works on [[transdisciplinarity]], on [[systems theory]], [[systemics]], prospective, on [[sociology]] and applied [[psychology]].

He is the inventor of the "Resources Systemics" approach, new model for systemic economy and society. It is based on 3 principles: 
(1) Every project, company or organisation should contribute to [[common good]].
(2) Every company, person, team, city authority or other stakeholder has assets and liabilities on 7 levels (earth, material, processes, emotional, communication, knowledge, common good)
(3) Every project should add value on different levels in its stakeholders ecosystem.
It activates underused or hidden resources in its stakeholdres ecosystem for the project. It creates "multiple value streams", and thus new solutions, new business models.
The result is more agility, faster implementation, less risk, more output with less resources. These resources can only be activated if the project answers needs of stakeholders.
He works on [[transition economy]] and transition methodologies based on metamorphosis principles. Specialized in updated transition economy principles and models, he brings these new principles to corporations and governments.

He initiated the "Club of Brussels" inside the Economic Transition Center in Brussels, school of new economic thinking. A group of 250 experts worldwide. It is an international network of ready-for-change human beings. The idea is not only to think about the new economic models based on systemic use of resources, but also to implement actions for the promotion of economic transition.

{{Tort law}}
'''Negligence in employment''' encompasses several causes of action in [[tort law]] that arise where an [[employer]] is held liable for the [[tortious]] acts of an [[employee]] because that employer was [[Negligence|negligent]] in providing the employee with the ability to engage in a particular act. Four basic causes of action may arise from such a scenario: '''negligent hiring''', '''negligent retention''', '''negligent supervision''' and '''negligent training'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Kathryn|last2=Gardner|first2=Susan|title=Looking for Dr. Jekyll but hiring Mr. Hyde: Preventing negligent hiring, supervision, retention, and training|journal=Hospital Topics|date=2000|volume=78|pages=14-22|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00185860009596542?journalCode=vhos20|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=When is an Employer Liable for an Employee's Motor Vehicle Accident|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/car-accidents/employer-liability.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=21 September 2017|date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While negligence in employment may overlap with [[negligent entrustment]] and [[vicarious liability]], the concepts are distinct grounds of liability.

==Negligence==
As with all [[negligence]] claims, the claimant must prove four elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galligan|first1=Thomas C.|title=A Primer on the Patterns of Negligence|journal=Louisiana Law Review|date=1992|volume=53|page=1509|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/louilr53&amp;div=59&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*That the defendant (in this case, the employer) owed them a [[duty of care]];
*That this duty was breached;
*That the claimant was injured as a result of the breach;&lt;ref name=F&amp;J&gt;Feliu &amp; Johnson, ''Negligence in Employment Law'' {{ISBN|1-57018-263-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57018-263-1}} (2002) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Causation (law)]]; [[Causation in English law]]) and
*The injury to the plaintiff was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the breach.&lt;ref name=F&amp;J/&gt;

In order for such a duty to exist, the injury to the claimant must be "reasonably foreseeable",&lt;ref&gt;see [[Negligence]]; [[Donoghue v Stevenson]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, for example, that the type of employment must be one in which an unfit employee could cause harm of the type which occurred,&lt;ref name=F&amp;J/&gt; and the claimant is the type of person to whom such harm would be a "reasonably foreseeable consequence".&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', [[The Wagon Mound (No 2)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negligent hiring==
'''Negligent hiring''' may be found where the employee (the tortfeasor) had a reputation or record that showed his/her propensity to misuse the kind of authority given by the employer, and this record would have been easily discoverable by the employer, had the employer exercised 'due diligence'. For example, a victim of [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace may have a cause of action for negligent hiring on the part of her employer if she can show that the employer was aware of the harasser's termination from a previous position for the same behaviour.

===Negligent hiring preventive measures===
In the sexual harassment example described above, the employer may be held liable for negligent hiring if the harasser had a previous history of harassment. This is because an employer has an obligation to its employees and others who will come in contact with them to provide a safe and productive working environment.

One preventive measure for negligent hiring is to perform a reasonable investigation on potential employees. This may include conducting interviews, verifying work and educational histories, checking references and conducting a [[background check]] on all applicants who have accepted an offer of conditional hire, and if an adverse assessment is found, to deny employment to such an applicant.

Note that simply conducting a criminal background check on an applicant may not be a sufficient investigation. In [[Minnesota]], for example, such a check was determined to be insufficient by the court in ''Ponticas v. K.M.S. Investments,'' 331 N.W.2d 907 ([[Minnesota Supreme Court|Minn.]] 1983). This will not guarantee the employer will not be held liable, but it will show that the employer used a diligent search to screen potential harassers from the workplace, and will assist the employer in demonstrating that it took reasonable care in hiring.
It is important to also note that, in the [[United States]], background checks for job applicants are subject to the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Credit Reporting Act|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2b1fab8de5438fc52f2a326fc6592874&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title16/16CIsubchapF.tpl|website=U.S. Government Publishing Office|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an adverse assessment is found in an employment screen, the applicant has the right to dispute the report.

==Negligent retention, supervision, and training==
'''Negligent retention''' occurs where a party failed to remove an employee from a position of authority or responsibility after it became apparent that the employee was in fact misusing that authority or responsibility in a way that posed a danger to others.

Negligent supervision is closely related, as it occurs where a party fails to reasonably monitor or control the actions of an employee. A variation of negligent retention or supervision is negligent training, which arises where the employer's training of the employee fails to prevent the employee from engaging in the acts that injure the claimant, or fails to remediate a pattern of behaviour which leads to an injury. Suits for negligent retention often plead negligent supervision or training as an alternate theory, as the employer who knows of an employee's improper conduct should either terminate that employee, or take steps to penalise that conduct and/or train the employee not to engage in that conduct.

==Related doctrines==

===Negligent entrustment compared===
[[Negligent entrustment]] arises where the entrustor is held liable for [[negligence]] because they negligently provided the entrustee with a dangerous instrument, and the entrusted party caused injury to a third party with that instrument. 
Where such a claim is brought against an [[employer]], the employer will be held liable if the entrustee's record was known, or would have been easily discoverable, to the employer. For example, if a [[bus]] company hires a driver who has a record of reckless driving, of which the company could have learned through a search of publicly available records, the company would be liable for the negligent entrustment of the bus to that driver, should the driver cause an accident.

Negligent entrustment differs from negligent hiring, retention, supervision, and training in two key respects. 
* First, negligent hiring and the related torts require the employment itself of the tortfeasor causing the injury, whereas a party can be held liable for negligent entrustment to any person.
* Second, an employer can be found liable for negligent hiring even without provision of any dangerous instrument to the employee. However, where an employer hires an unqualified person to engage in the use of a dangerous instrumentality, as in the above example with the bus driver, the employer may be liable for '''both''' negligent entrustment and hiring.

===Vicarious liability compared===
[[Vicarious liability]] is a separate theory of liability, which provides that an employer is liable for the torts of an employee under an [[agency (law)|agency]] theory, even if the employer did nothing wrong. The principle is that the acts of an agent of the company are assumed, by law, to be the acts of the company itself, provided the tortfeasor was acting within the course of his employment.

By contrast, each of the above negligence theories requires proof of actual negligence on part of the employer ''before'' the injury occurred, for example when the employee was first hired.

==Early life and career==
Born into an established merchant family in [[Yamanashi, Yamanashi|Yamanashi]], [[Yamanashi Prefecture]], he moved to Tokyo in 1897, and became independently wealthy through stock investments.

Nezu was elected as a member of the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] in the [[National Diet]] in 1904 and won three subsequent reelections. He was elevated to the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Peers]] in 1926.

In 1905 Nezu became President of [[Tobu Railway]] and successfully helped to grow the company to one of the largest private rail operators in the Kanto region. Other business interests included managerial and shareholding roles in Tokyo Basha Tetsudo (Tokyo Horse-Drawn Carriage Railways), Tokyo Dento (Tokyo electric Light Company) and in [[Tokyo Gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portraits of Modern Japanese Historical Figures|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/portrait/e/datas/480.html?cat=91|website=National Diet Library, Japan|publisher=National Diet Library, Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Accompanying [[Shibusawa Eiichi]] on a trade mission to the United States in 1909, Nezu was inspired by American industrialist's enthusiasm for civic and philanthropic activities. On his return to Japan Nezu founded and donated to a number of new educational and cultural initiatives including [[Musashi Junior and Senior High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yamamoto|first1=Tadashi|title=The Nonprofit Sector in Japan|date=1998|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0-7190-5385-4|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1909 Business Mission|url=http://www.shibusawa.or.jp/english/eiichi/1909/member.html#tky06|website=Shibusawa Eiichi Memorial Foundation|publisher=Shibusawa Eiichi Memorial Foundation|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nezu Memorial Museum main building.JPG|thumb|Nezu Memorial Museum, Yamanashi]]Nezu was a keen practitioner of the [[Japanese tea ceremony]] and his extensive private collection of pre-modern Japanese and East Asian art, served as the basis for the [[Nezu Museum]] in [[Minato, Tokyo]]. The museum buildings were rebuilt in 2006 to modern design by Japanese architect [[Kengo Kuma]], but the gardens of the museum also retain multiple traditional [[Chashitsu]] structures for tea ceremony gatherings.

Constructed in 1933, Nezu's family home in Yamanashi has been preserved as the Nezu Memorial Museum. The main house, gate house and three story [[Kura (storehouse)]], were listed as registered tangible cultural properties in 2007.

      <comment>/* Datsun and Nissan UK */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5677">'''Octav Botnar''' (October 21, 1913 – July 11, 1998) was a self-made businessman  who founded [[Datsun]] UK (later [[Nissan|Nissan UK]]) and its associated car retail business [[Automotive Financial Group]] (AFG). He was a noted [[philanthropist]], who donated over £100 million in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cameliabotnar.com/|website=Camelia Botnar Foundation|title=about page|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Chernivtsi]], which was then called [[Czernowitz]] and belonged to [[Austria-Hungary]]. During his childhood, in 1918, Austria-Hungary dissolved and his hometown, renamed [[Cernăuţi]], became part of [[Romania]]. Under its present name it is now part of [[Ukraine]].

He spent 1932–1936 in prison. Afterwards, he moved to [[France]], where he joined the [[French Resistance]] and fought against the Nazis in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12256478.Octav_Botnar/|title=Octav Botnar|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Romania in 1946 and remained there until 1960. In 1966, he fled [[Communist]] [[Eastern Europe]] and ended up in [[Worthing]] in [[England]]. It was in Worthing where he founded Datsun UK (now [[Nissan]] UK) in 1970.  

== Datsun and Nissan UK ==
Botnar had originally run the UK import business for the German manufacturer [[NSU]], however this business was dissolved when NSU was taken over by [[Volkswagen]] in 1969  (ultimately becoming [[Audi]]), and Botnar was looking for a new venutre.  He successfully became the UK franchisee and importer for [[Nissan]], and its [[Datsun]] range of cars.   Under Botnar's leadership, Datsun had become one of the biggest car imports in Britain, outselling not only its arch Japanese rival [[Toyota]] but eventually became the most popular foreign brand in the UK.  At its peak,  Botnar owned more than 200 Nissan dealerships throughout the country and was considered one of Britain's wealthiest men. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/18/business/octav-botnar-84-an-importer-named-in-british-tax-scandal.html|title=Octav Botnar, 84, an Importer Named in British Tax Scandal|last=Sorkin|first=Andrew Ross|date=1998-07-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
Octav's only child, Camelia Botnar was killed in a car crash near Stonehenge in 1968 at the age of 20. Her death led to a wave of philanthropy that saw Botnar donate millions to charity throughout his later life. One of his larger donations was  £13 million to London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. He also established the ''Camelia Botnar Foundation'' in his daughters memory. The foundation is still active today, providing residential training and work experience, helping young people to learn a skilled trade, embark on a useful career path and successfully make their own way in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cameliabotnar.com/|title=Camelia Botnar Foundation - Home page|website=www.cameliabotnar.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tax Controversy ==
In June 1991, the Inland Revenue raided Nissan UK's headquarters, as well as Mr. Botnar's home and the homes of other company officials. The tax authority accused Botnar of evading more than £200 million in taxes. Botnar left for Switzerland and lived there for the rest of his life in [[Villars-sur-Ollon]]. 

The Nissan UK and AFG businesses subsequently foundered, after Nissan took its UK distribution and import activities completely in-house in 1991.

Although Botnar maintained his innocence up until his final hours, he had agreed to pay £59 million to settle the case. Following settling, he opened a suit against the Inland Revenue for damages and malicious prosecution. At the time he said: "The damages I am seeking are only token, but I want to clear my name. I want my day in court". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12256478.Octav_Botnar/|title=Octav Botnar|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- There are 4 places in France by this name, no point to linking if we don't know which. --&gt;

== Death ==
Botnar spent his last years as a tax exile in Switzerland fighting the Inland Revenue. 

He died on July 11th 1998 at the age of 84 after suffering from stomach cancer. He is buried in the Passy Cemetery, Paris. Tory party chairman Lord Parkinson once described Botnar as &lt;nowiki&gt;''truly one of our greatest philanthropists''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12256478.Octav_Botnar/|title=Octav Botnar|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Stephane Gigandet Open food facts KidEXPERIMENT @ Open World Forum Paris.JPG|thumbnail|left|Stéphane Gigandet presenting the project on October 2012 at the [[Open World Forum]].]]

The project gathers information and data on food products from around the world.&lt;ref name=whoweare /&gt;

== Oil and gas exploration ==
[[File:Bawden Drilling Oil Rig-1.jpg|thumb|left|One of the first Bawden Drilling oil rigs in Calgary, Canada; circa 1955.]][[File:Bawden Drilling Oil Rig-2 Gas Flaring.jpg|thumb|left|A Bawden Drilling North Sea oil rig; circa 1980.]][[File:King Hussein of Jordan &amp; Peter Bawden.jpg|thumb|King Hussein of Jordan &amp; Peter Bawden. King Hussein hosted Peter Bawden in 1979 as an official guest of the Country of Jordan.]][[File:Bawden Drilling Houston Office--500px.png|thumb|Bawden Drilling United States headquarters in Houston, Texas.]] Bawden founded and built the world’s largest (at the time) privately owned oil and gas drilling company.  In business for over 35 years, and consisting of a large fleet of offshore and land rigs operated from offices worldwide, Bawden Drilling worked closely with Shell Oil, Mobil Corporation and Dome Petroleum, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, A. (2015). We gambled everything: The life and times of an oilman.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to Alberta in the fall of 1950 and founded Peter Bawden Drilling in 1952 shortly after his arrival in Calgary. In 1960, at the age of 31, Peter Bawden’s first drilling rig struck oil. With its acquisition of Trident Drilling, Bawden Drilling became Canada’s largest drilling company. In 1968, Peter Bawden Drilling acquired Brown Drilling in California. Thereafter, as a land drilling contractor, Bawden expanded the company's on-shore operations throughout North America, from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico, to Norway, Algeria, Australia, New Guinea, Indonesia, Philippines, Guatemala, Venezuela, Colombia, Madagascar, and the Middle East. Eventually having operations on every continent in the world.

A notable contribution of the Bawden organization was the development of Canadian oilfield expertise and technology in many parts of the world. Bawden’s first offshore assignments began in 1968 off the coast of Australia where the company operated that continent’s first self-containing platform rigs. In the North Sea, Bawden Drilling became the largest development-drilling contractor in the United Kingdom. Well known for technological, industry advances, Bawden designed and built the world’s largest (at that time) semi-submersible rig for Shell Oil. They also had large platform rig operations off the California coast, in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Malaysia.

Bawden set many industry records including drilling a deviated well -11,324 feet in eighteen days from a fixed platform in the North Sea. Other notable rigs were located in the middle of the Pasadena Raceway and behind the Beverly Hills high school. He was a visionary trailblazer in his 1964 activities to promote Canada as an exporter of LNG (Liquefied Petroleum Gases). In 1977, he created Mosswood Oil &amp; Gas expanding into oil production.

Peter Bawden committed his life to the search for oil, gas and geothermal energy. Geothermal Drilling was a Bawden specialty with over 20 years of experience in the challenging tapping of hot water and steam reservoirs. Bawden won numerous industry awards for its emphasis on safety. The company also received the Canadian Export Award in 1985 and Export Achievement Awards in the years 1981, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986.

During his years in Ottawa he served on the Commons Committee on Finance, Natural Resources, Trade and Economic Affairs, including External Affairs and National Defense. For seven years he served as a delegate to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly representing the Canadian Parliament to meet and discuss common security problems. He also served on the Canada/US Inter-parliamentary Committee.

His community service included acting as a Director in the Business Council of National Issues, Calgary Special Olympics and Trustee of the Canadian Olympic Association and Wycliffe College in Toronto. His membership included Canada West Foundation, Ducks Unlimited Canada, and he was an Honorary Colonel of the 14th (Calgary) Service Battalion, Honorary Vice-President of the Calgary Regional Council of the Boy Scouts of Canada and Director of the Confederation of Church and Business People, and he was the founding donor to [http://www.calgaryfoundation.org/ The Calgary Foundation].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calgary-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/mercury_assets/1094/original.pdf?1443104431|title=Calgary Foundation Annual Report (2014-2015)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Bawden Drilling World Map.png|thumb|Bawden Drilling Global Oil &amp; Gas Operations|225x225px]][[File:Bawden Drilling Crew.jpg|thumb|Bawden Drilling crew conducting safety training circa 1979.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37008">'''Production''' is a process of combining various material inputs and immaterial inputs (plans, know-how) in order to make something for consumption (the output). It is the act of creating [[output (economics)|output]], a [[goods and  services|good or service]] which has [[value (economics)|value]] and contributes to the [[utility (economics)|utility]] of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;"Kotler", P., Armstrong, G., Brown, L., and Adam, S. (2006) ''Marketing'', 7th Ed. Pearson Education Australia/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic well-being is created in a production process, meaning all economic activities that aim directly or indirectly to satisfy human wants and [[need]]s. The degree to which the needs are satisfied is often accepted as a measure of economic well-being. In production there are two features which explain increasing economic well-being. They are improving quality-price-ratio of goods and services and increasing incomes from growing and more efficient market production.

The most important forms of production are:
* [[Market (economics)|market production]]
* [[Public economics|public production]]
* [[household production]]

In order to understand the origin of the economic well-being, we must understand these three production processes. All of them produce commodities which have value and contribute to well-being of individuals.

The satisfaction of needs originates from the use of the commodities which are produced. The need satisfaction increases when the quality-price-ratio of the commodities improves and more satisfaction is achieved at less cost. Improving the quality-price-ratio of commodities is to a producer an essential way to improve the competitiveness of products but this kind of gains distributed to customers cannot be measured with production data. Improving the competitiveness of products means often to the producer lower product prices and therefore losses in incomes which are to compensated with the growth of sales volume.

Economic well-being also increases due to the growth of incomes that are gained from the growing and more efficient market production. Market production is the only production form which creates and distributes incomes to stakeholders. Public production and household production are financed by the incomes generated in market production. Thus market production has a double role in creating well-being, i.e. the role of producing goods and services and the role of creating income. Because of this double role market production is the “primus motor” of economic well-being and therefore here under review.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==As a source of economic well-being==
In principle there are two main activities in an economy, production and consumption. Similarly there are two kinds of actors, producers and consumers. Well-being is made possible by efficient production and by the interaction between producers and consumers. In the interaction, consumers can be identified in two roles both of which generate well-being. Consumers can be both customers of the producers and suppliers to the producers. The customers’ well-being arises from the commodities they are buying and the suppliers’ well-being is related to the income they receive as compensation for the production inputs they have delivered to the producers.

===Stakeholders of production===

Stakeholders of production are persons, groups or organizations with an interest in a producing company. Economic well-being originates in efficient production and it is distributed through the interaction between the company’s stakeholders. The stakeholders of companies are economic actors which have an economic interest in a company. Based on the similarities of their interests, stakeholders can be classified into three groups in order to differentiate their interests and mutual relations. The three groups are as follows:
[[File:Interactive contributions of a company’s stakeholders.png|400 px|thumb|right|Interactive contributions of a company’s stakeholders (Saari, 2011,4)]]

*Customers
*Suppliers
*Producers.
The interests of these stakeholders and their relations to companies are described briefly below. Our purpose is to establish a framework for further analysis. 
 
''Customers''

The customers of a company are typically consumers, other market producers or producers in the public sector. Each of them has their individual production functions. Due to competition, the price-quality-ratios of commodities tend to improve and this brings the benefits of better productivity to customers. Customers get more for less. In households and the public sector this means that more need satisfaction is achieved at less cost. For this reason the productivity of customers can increase over time even though their incomes remain unchanged.

''Suppliers''

The suppliers of companies are typically producers of materials, energy, capital, and services. They all have their individual production functions. The changes in prices or qualities of supplied commodities have an effect on both actors’ (company and suppliers) production functions. We come to the conclusion that the production functions of the company and its suppliers are in a state of continuous change.

''Producer community''

The incomes are generated for those participating in production, i.e., the labour force, society and owners. These stakeholders are referred to here as producer communities or, in shorter form, as producers. The producer communities have a common interest in maximizing their incomes. These parties that contribute to production receive increased incomes from the growing and developing production.

The well-being gained through commodities stems from the price-quality relations of the commodities. Due to competition and development in the market, the price-quality relations of commodities tend to improve over time. Typically the quality of a commodity goes up and the price goes down over time. This development favourably affects the production functions of customers. Customers get more for less. Consumer customers get more satisfaction at less cost. This type of well-being generation can only partially be calculated from the production data. The situation is presented in this study.
The producer community (labour force, society, and owners) earns income as compensation for the inputs they have delivered to the production. When the production grows and becomes more efficient, the income tends to increase. In production this brings about an increased ability to pay salaries, taxes and profits. The growth of production and improved productivity generate additional income for the producing community. Similarly the high income level achieved in the community is a result of the high volume of production and its good performance. This type of well-being generation – as mentioned earlier - can be reliably calculated from the production data.

===Main processes of a producing company===
A producing company can be divided into sub-processes in different ways; yet, the following five are identified as main processes, each with a logic, objectives, theory and key figures of its own. It is important to examine each of them individually, yet, as a part of the whole, in order to be able to measure and understand them. The main processes of a company are as follows:
[[File:Main processes of a company.png|400px|thumb|Main processes of a producing company (Saari 2006,3)]]
* real process.
* income distribution process
* production process.
* monetary process.
* market value process.
Production output is created in the real process, gains of production are distributed in the income distribution process and these two processes constitute the production process. The production process and its sub-processes, the real process and income distribution process occur simultaneously, and only the production process is identifiable and measurable by the traditional [[accounting]] practices. The real process and income distribution process can be identified and measured by extra calculation, and this is why they need to be analyzed separately in order to understand the logic of production and its performance.

Real process generates the production output from input, and it can be described by means of the [[production function]]. It refers to a series of events in production in which production inputs of different quality and quantity are combined into products of different quality and quantity. Products can be physical goods, immaterial services and most often combinations of both. The characteristics created into the product by the producer imply [[surplus value]] to the consumer, and on the basis of the market price this value is shared by the consumer and the producer in the marketplace. This is the mechanism through which surplus value originates to the consumer and the producer likewise. Surplus values to customers cannot be measured from any production data. Instead the surplus value to a producer can be measured. It can be expressed both in terms of nominal and real values. The real surplus value to the producer is an outcome of the real process, real income, and measured proportionally it means productivity.

The concept “real process” in the meaning quantitative structure of production process was introduced in Finnish management accounting in 1960s. Since then it has been a cornerstone in the Finnish management accounting theory. (Riistama et al. 1971)

Income distribution process of the production refers to a series of events in which the unit prices of constant-quality products and inputs alter causing a change in income distribution among those participating in the exchange. The magnitude of the change in income distribution is directly proportionate to the change in prices of the output and inputs and to their quantities. [[Productivity]] gains are distributed, for example, to customers as lower product sales prices or to staff as higher income pay.

The production process consists of the real process and the income distribution process. A result and a criterion of success of the owner is profitability. The profitability of production is the share of the real process result the owner has been able to keep to himself in the income distribution process. Factors describing the production process are the components of [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]], i.e., returns and costs. They differ from the factors of the real process in that the components of profitability are given at nominal prices whereas in the real process the factors are at periodically fixed prices.

Monetary process refers to events related to financing the business. Market value process refers to a series of events in which investors determine the market value of the company in the investment markets.

===Production growth and performance===
{{Main article|Economic growth}}
Economic growth is often defined as a production increase of an output of a production process. It is usually expressed as a growth percentage depicting growth of the real production output. The real output is the real value of products produced in a production process and when we subtract the real input from the real output we get the real income. The real output and the real income are generated by the real process of production from the real inputs.

The real process can be described by means of the production function. The production function is a graphical or mathematical expression showing the relationship between the inputs used in production and the output achieved. Both graphical and mathematical expressions are presented and demonstrated. The production function is a simple description of the mechanism of income generation in production process.  It consists of two components. These components are a change in production input and a change in productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Genesca &amp; Grifell 1992, Saari 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Components of economic growth.png|left|thumb|300px|Components of economic growth (Saari 2006,2)]]

The figure illustrates an income generation process(exaggerated for clarity). The Value T2 (value at time 2) represents the growth in output from Value T1 (value at time 1). Each time of measurement has its own graph of the production function for that time (the straight lines). The output measured at time 2 is greater than the output measured at time one for both of the components of growth: an increase of inputs and an increase of productivity. The portion of growth caused by the increase in inputs is shown on line 1 and does not change the relation between inputs and outputs. The portion of growth caused by an increase in productivity is shown on line 2 with a steeper slope. So increased productivity represents greater output per unit of input.

The growth of production output does not reveal anything about the performance of the production process. The performance of production measures production’s ability to generate income. Because the income from production is generated in the real process, we call it the real income. Similarly, as the production function is an expression of the real process, we could also call it “income generated by the production function”.

The real income generation follows the logic of the production function. Two components can also be distinguished in the income change: the income growth caused by an increase in production input (production volume) and the income growth caused by an increase in productivity. The income growth caused by increased production volume is determined by moving along the production function graph. The income growth corresponding to a shift of the production function is generated by the increase in productivity. The change of real income so signifies a move from the point 1 to the point 2 on the production function (above). When we want to maximize the production performance we have to maximize the income generated by the production function.

The sources of productivity growth and production volume growth are explained as follows. Productivity growth is seen as the key economic indicator of innovation. The successful introduction of new products and new or altered processes, organization structures, systems, and business models generates growth of output that exceeds the growth of inputs. This results in growth in productivity or output per unit of input. Income growth can also take place without innovation through replication of established technologies. With only replication and without innovation, output will increase in proportion to inputs. (Jorgenson et al. 2014,2) This is the case of income growth through production volume growth.

Jorgenson et al. (2014,2) give an empiric example. They show that the great preponderance of economic growth in the US since 1947 involves the replication of existing technologies through investment in equipment, structures, and software and expansion of the labor force. Further they show that innovation accounts for only about twenty percent of US economic growth.

In the case of a single production process (described above) the output is defined as an economic value of products and services produced in the process. When we want to examine an entity of many production processes we have to sum up the value-added created in the single processes. This is done in order to avoid the double accounting of intermediate inputs. Value-added is obtained by subtracting the intermediate inputs from the outputs. The most well-known and used measure of value-added is the GDP (Gross Domestic Product). It is widely used as a measure of the economic growth of nations and industries.

===Absolute (total) and average income===

The production performance can be measured as an average or an absolute income. Expressing performance both in average (avg.) and absolute (abs.) quantities is helpful for understanding the welfare effects of production. For measurement of the average production performance, we use the known productivity ratio

* Real output / Real input.

The absolute income of performance is obtained by subtracting the real input from the real output as follows:
* Real income (abs.) = Real output&amp;nbsp;– Real input

The growth of the real income is the increase of the economic value which can be distributed between the production stakeholders. With the aid of the production model we can perform the average and absolute accounting in one calculation. Maximizing production performance requires using the absolute measure, i.e. the real income and its derivatives as a criterion of production performance.

Maximizing productivity also leads to the phenomenon called "[[jobless recovery|jobless growth]]" This refers to economic growth as a result of productivity growth but without creation of new jobs and new incomes from them. A practical example illustrates the case. When a jobless person obtains a job in market production we may assume it is a low productivity job. As a result, average productivity decreases but the real income per capita increases. Furthermore, the well-being of the society also grows. This example reveals the difficulty to interpret the total productivity change correctly. The combination of volume increase and total productivity decrease leads in this case to the improved performance because we are on the “diminishing returns” area of the production function. If we are on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function, the combination of production volume increase and total productivity increase leads to improved production performance. Unfortunately we do not know in practice on which part of the production function we are. Therefore, a correct interpretation of a performance change is obtained only by measuring the real income change.

==Production models==
A production model is a numerical description of the production process and is based on the prices and the quantities of inputs and outputs. There are two main approaches to operationalize the concept of production function. We can use mathematical formulae, which are typically used in macroeconomics (in growth accounting) or arithmetical models, which are typically used in microeconomics and management accounting. We do not present the former approach here but refer to the survey “Growth accounting” by Hulten 2009.

We use here arithmetical models because they are like the models of management accounting, illustrative and easily understood and applied in practice. Furthermore, they are integrated to management accounting, which is a practical advantage. A major advantage of the arithmetical model is its capability to depict production function as a part of production process. Consequently, production function can be understood, measured, and examined as a part of production process.

There are different production models according to different interests. Here we use a production income model and a production analysis model in order to demonstrate production function as a phenomenon and a measureable quantity.

===Production income model===
[[File:Profitability of production measured by surplus value.png|left|thumb|400px|Profitability of production measured by surplus value (Saari 2006,3)]]

The scale of success run by a going concern is manifold, and there are no criteria that might be universally applicable to success. Nevertheless, there is one criterion by which we can generalise the rate of success in production. This criterion is the ability to produce surplus value. As a criterion of profitability, surplus value refers to the difference between returns and costs, taking into consideration the costs of equity in addition to the costs included in the profit and loss statement as usual. Surplus value indicates that the output has more value than the sacrifice made for it, in other words, the output value is higher than the value (production costs) of the used inputs. If the surplus value is positive, the owner’s profit expectation has been surpassed.

The table presents a surplus value calculation. We call this set of production data a basic example and we use the data through the article in illustrative production models. The basic example is a simplified profitability calculation used for illustration and modelling. Even as reduced, it comprises all phenomena of a real measuring situation and most importantly the change in the output-input mix between two periods. Hence, the basic example works as an illustrative “scale model” of production without any features of a real measuring situation being lost. In practice, there may be hundreds of products and inputs but the logic of measuring does not differ from that presented in the basic example.

In this context we define the quality requirements for the production data used in productivity accounting. The most important criterion of good measurement is the homogenous quality of the measurement object. If the object is not homogenous, then the measurement result may include changes in both quantity and quality but their respective shares will remain unclear. In productivity accounting this criterion requires that every item of output and input must appear in accounting as being homogenous. In other words, the inputs and the outputs are not allowed to be aggregated in measuring and accounting. If they are aggregated, they are no longer homogenous and hence the measurement results may be biased.

Both the absolute and relative surplus value have been calculated in the example. Absolute value is the difference of the output and input values and the relative value is their relation, respectively. The surplus value calculation in the example is at a nominal price, calculated at the market price of each period.

===Production analysis model===
[[File:Productivity model.png|350px|thumb|[http://www.mido.fi/Index_tiedostot/Production%20Model%20Saari%202004%20e.htm Production Model Saari 2004] (Saari 2006,4)]]
A model &lt;ref&gt;Courbois &amp; Temple 1975, Gollop 1979, Kurosawa 1975, Saari 1976, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; used here is a typical production analysis model by help of which it is possible to calculate the outcome of the real process, income distribution process and production process. The starting point is a profitability calculation using surplus value as a criterion of profitability. The surplus value calculation is the only valid measure for understanding the connection between profitability and productivity or understanding the connection between real process and production process. A valid measurement of total productivity necessitates considering all production inputs, and the surplus value calculation is the only calculation to conform to the requirement. If we omit an input in productivity or income accounting, this means that the omitted input can be used unlimitedly in production without any cost impact on accounting results.

===Accounting and interpreting ===
The process of calculating is best understood by applying the term ''ceteris paribus'', i.e. "all other things being the same," stating that at a time only the impact of one changing factor be introduced to the phenomenon being examined. Therefore, the calculation can be presented as a process advancing step by step. First, the impacts of the income distribution process are calculated, and then, the impacts of the real process on the profitability of the production.

The first step of the calculation is to separate the impacts of the real process and the income distribution process, respectively, from the change in profitability (285.12&amp;nbsp;– 266.00 = 19.12). This takes place by simply creating one auxiliary column (4) in which a surplus value calculation is compiled using the quantities of Period 1 and the prices of Period 2. In the resulting profitability calculation, Columns 3 and 4 depict the impact of a change in income distribution process on the profitability and in Columns 4 and 7 the impact of a change in real process on the profitability.

The accounting results are easily interpreted and understood. We see that the real income has increased by 58.12 units from which 41.12 units come from the increase of productivity growth and the rest 17.00 units come from the production volume growth. The total increase of real income (58.12) is distributed to the stakeholders of production, in this case 39.00 units to the customers and to the suppliers of inputs and the rest 19.12 units to the owners.

Here we can make an important conclusion. Income formation of production is always a balance between income generation and income distribution. The income change created in a real process  (i.e. by production function) is always distributed to the stakeholders as economic values within the review period. Accordingly, the changes in real income and income distribution are always equal in terms of economic value.

Based on the accounted changes of productivity and production volume values we can explicitly conclude on which part of the production function the production is. The rules of interpretations are the following:

The production is on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function, when
* productivity and production volume increase or
* productivity and production volume decrease

The production is on the part of “diminishing returns” on the production function, when
* productivity decreases and volume increases or
* productivity increases and volume decreases.

In the basic example the combination of volume growth (+17.00) and productivity growth (+41.12) reports explicitly that the production is on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function (Saari 2006 a, 138–144).

Another production model ([http://www.mido.fi/Index_tiedostot/Production%20Model%20Saari%201989%20e.htm Production Model Saari 1989]) also gives details of the income distribution (Saari 2011,14). Because the accounting techniques of the two models are different, they give differing, although complementary, analytical information. The accounting results are, however, identical. We do not present the model here in detail but we only use its detailed data on income distribution, when the objective functions are formulated in the next section.

==Objective functions==
An efficient way to improve the understanding of production performance is to formulate different objective functions according to the objectives of the different interest groups. Formulating the [[objective function]] necessitates defining the variable to be maximized (or minimized). After that other variables are considered as constraints or free variables. The most familiar objective function is profit maximization which is also included in this case. [[Profit maximization]] is an objective function that stems from the owner’s interest and all other variables are constraints in relation to maximizing of profits in the organization.

[[File:Income formation.png|300px|right|thumb|Summary of objective function formulations (Saari 2011,17)]]

===The procedure for formulating objective functions===
The procedure for formulating different objective functions, in terms of the production model, is introduced next. In the income formation from production the following objective functions can be identified:
* Maximizing the real income
* Maximizing the producer income
* Maximizing the owner income.
These cases are illustrated using the numbers from the basic example. The following symbols are used in the presentation:
The equal sign (=) signifies the starting point of the computation or the result of computing and the plus or minus sign (+ / -) signifies a variable that is to be added or subtracted from the function. A producer means here the producer community, i.e. labour force, society and owners.

Objective function formulations can be expressed in a single calculation which concisely illustrates the logic of the income generation, the income distribution and the variables to be maximized.

The calculation resembles an [[income statement]] starting with the income generation and ending with the income distribution. The income generation and the distribution are always in balance so that their amounts are equal. In this case it is 58.12 units. The income which has been generated in the real process is distributed to the stakeholders during the same period. There are three variables which can be maximized. They are the real income, the producer income and the owner income. Producer income and owner income are practical quantities because they are addable quantities and they can be computed quite easily. Real income is normally not an addable quantity and in many cases it is difficult to calculate.

===The dual approach for the formulation===
Here we have to add that the change of real income can also be computed from the changes in income distribution. We have to identify the unit price changes of outputs and inputs and calculate their profit impacts (i.e. unit price change x quantity). The change of real income is the sum of these profit impacts and the change of owner income. This approach is called the dual approach because the framework is seen in terms of prices instead of quantities (ONS 3, 23).

The dual approach has been recognized in growth accounting for long but its interpretation has remained unclear. The following question has remained unanswered: “Quantity based estimates of the residual are interpreted as a shift in the production function, but what is the interpretation of the price-based growth estimates?” (Hulten 2009, 18). We have demonstrated above that the real income change is achieved by quantitative changes in production and the income distribution change to the stakeholders is its dual. In this case the duality means that the same accounting result is obtained by accounting the change of the total income generation (real income) and by accounting the change of the total income distribution.

'''Robert Sheriff Black''' (1868 – 4 January 1939) was [[Mayor of Dunedin]] from 1929 to 1933. 

==Biography==
Black was born in [[Liverpool]] in 1868 and migrated to [[Melbourne]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia. He came to New Zealand in 1897, where he entered the trade of exporting rabbit skins.&lt;ref name="EP obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19390105.2.97 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |date=5 January 1939 |volume=CXXVII |issue=3|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, he married [[Helen Black (mayoress)|Helen Black]], who was 30 years his junior.&lt;ref name="DNZB Helen Black"&gt;{{DNZB| Tennant| Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Tennant|4b35|Black, Helen McKenzie|10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black already had adult sons who were his wife's age, and together they had a further two sons and two daughters.&lt;ref name="DNZB Helen Black" /&gt;

He first stood for the Dunedin mayoralty in 1919, but was beaten by [[William Begg]].

In December 2008, he suffered a [[brain injury]] which has left him with profound [[retrograde amnesia]]. Scott, along with Joan Bolzan and [[Caitlin Rother]], have written a book titled ''My Life: Deleted'', which was published by [[Harper Collins]] and was released on October 4, 2011. ''My Life: Deleted'' appeared on [[The New York Times Best Seller List]] on October 8 at #16 for ebooks non-fiction and #29 for combined hardcover and ebooks non-fiction.&lt;ref name="Bordow"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/reports-reviews-sections/profiles-biographies/12672598-1.html|title=Gilbert man struggles to remember his life|first=Scott|last=Bordow|publisher=[[East Valley Tribune]]|date=August 16, 2009|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Scott Bolzan was born to Louis and Alice Bolzan in 1962. He grew up in Chicago, Illinois where he attended [[Northern Illinois University]] from 1980 to 1984 on a full [[athletic scholarship]]. It was there that he met his wife, Joan, whom he married in 1984.

==Football career==
In college, Bolzan played [[American football|football]] for the [[Northern Illinois Huskies football|Northern Illinois Huskies]]. After graduating, he went on to play professionally, though his career lasted only two years.&lt;ref name="Bordow" /&gt;

Bolzan was [[NFL draft|drafted]] in May 1984 by the [[New England Patriots]] in the 9th round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a6QyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Oe8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3804,917596&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=NFL Draft|publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=May 2, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Waivers (American football)|waived]] by the Patriots in August of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h_EKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=708DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3544,4390557&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=Transactions|publisher=[[The Prescott Courier]]|date=August 22, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to play for the [[Memphis Showboats]] in the [[USFL]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflalumniaz.org/about.html|title=About NFL Alumni Arizona|publisher=[[NFL Alumni]] Arizona|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolzan was then picked up by the [[Cleveland Browns]] in May 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sPUPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z48DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1977,4877971&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=Transactions|publisher=[[Ellensburg Daily Record]]|date=May 6, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later waived in September 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ahYzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RzIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6916,107197&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=Familiar names are put on waivers as teams cut to 45|publisher=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]]|date=September 3, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-signed later in the month&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=10ojAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Nc8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4191,5356361&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=Transactions|publisher=[[The Palm Beach Post]]|date=September 27, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cut in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=28sqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0c4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1106,1525886&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=Notes...|publisher=The Palm Beach Post|date=October 3, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolzan was signed by the Browns again in May 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lB0jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ac8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4449,2464543&amp;dq=scott+bolzan&amp;hl=en|title=Transactions|publisher=The Palm Beach Post|date=May 3, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was injured in August 1986 and retired soon after.

==Entrepreneurship==
After his football career ended due to an injury, Bolzan entered the financial services field where he owned his own financial planning firm specializing in insurance and investments. After moving to [[Arizona]] in 1993, he took up [[aviation]], and later developed West Jet Aircraft&amp;mdash;a charter company specializing in the charter of [[Lear Jet]]s and King Airs in the Scottsdale area of Arizona.  West Jet grew to become the Number 1 Charter Operator in Arizona according to ''Arizona Ranking Magazine'' in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} He sold West Jet aircraft in February 2008 and opened the doors of Legendary Jets shortly after, where he is the CEO/Founder specializing in private jet management.

==Brain injury==
On December 17, 2008, Scott Bolzan slipped in the men's bathroom at his place of work.&lt;ref name="PhoenixBiz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/09/28/story3.html?b=1254110400%5E2156121|title=Entrepreneur suffers from amnesia following fall|first=Chris|last=Casacchia|publisher=[[Phoenix Business Journal]]|date=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nightline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/amnesia-man-hits-head-loses-memories/story?id=10396719|title=Amnesia Man Hits Head Loses All Memories|publisher=[[ABC News]] ''[[Nightline]]''|date=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says his last "actual memory" was "my feet going above my head". The fall caused a severe [[concussion]]. Bolzan was initially told his [[memory loss]] was normal and temporary, but as months passed by and he still did not remember any part of his life before the fall, he revealed his condition to his wife and they sought help from [[neurologist]]s.

A [[SPECT scan]] of Bolzan's [[human brain|brain]] showed that he had no [[blood flow]] to his right [[temporal lobe]]&amp;mdash;the part of the brain that stores [[long-term memory]]. Blood flow to the front of his brain on both sides is also dramatically reduced.&lt;ref name="Nightline" /&gt; He suffered brain [[atrophy]], which killed [[brain cells]] and damaged connections between them.&lt;ref name="PhoenixBiz" /&gt; The loss of blood flow caused Bolzan to suffer an unusually severe case of [[retrograde amnesia]]. Dr. Teresa Lanier, Bolzan's primary physician, has said "It would basically have to be a miracle for him to one day wake up and have complete and intact memory of everything he has lost. That's probably just never going to happen."&lt;ref name="Nightline" /&gt;

Bolzan's wife has tried to help him remember parts of his life since his fall, showing him photographs of key events in his life in hopes of jogging his memory.&lt;ref name="Nightline" /&gt; Along with memories of his personal life, he has lost memories of historical events and basic [[interpersonal relationship]] concepts. He did not understand [[birthday]]s&lt;ref name="PhoenixBiz" /&gt; or the relationship between a [[husband]] and [[wife]].&lt;ref name="Nightline" /&gt; He had no reference points. He did, however, remember basic life tasks, like using [[eating utensil]]s and how to drive a car.&lt;ref name="KPHO"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kpho.com/news/22861673/detail.html|title=Amnesia Patient Shares Story Of Struggle|first=Cara|last=Liu|publisher=KPHO.com|date=March 16, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614060245/http://www.kpho.com/news/22861673/detail.html|archivedate=June 14, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott has appeared on talk shows such as Dr. Phil, The View, Fox and Friends, Good Morning America, The Huckabee Show, The Doctors, Nightline, guest appearance on Couples Therapy. Scott has also been a guest on numerous syndicated radio shows and local news stations.

The New York Post published an article on October 9, 2011 reporting that a doctor who examined Bolzan after his fall stated that Bolzan was possibly "feigning his alleged memory deficits", explaining that it is questionable that an injury to one part of the brain could affect all the different memories distributed among the organ, while not damaging his cognitive abilities or his ability to form new memories. The article also cited other neurologists who, while having not examined Bolzan, stated that his amnesia violates fundamental knowledge of neurobiology, in that old memories are more resistant to brain damage than recent ones, in contrast to Bolzan's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Memory 'loss' is hi$ gain |first=Susannah |last=Cahalan |authorlink=Susannah Cahalan |url=https://nypost.com/2011/10/09/memory-loss-is-hi-gain/ |newspaper=The New York Post |date=October 9, 2011 |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11806">'''Situation analysis''' refers to a collection of methods that [[Management|managers]] use to analyze an organization's internal and external environment to understand the organization's capabilities, customers, and business environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.marketingpower.com/_layouts/Dictionary.aspx?dLetter=S|title=Dictionary of marketing terms|publisher=American Marketing Association|accessdate= 14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation analysis consists of several methods of analysis: The [[#5C Analysis|5Cs Analysis]], [[SWOT analysis]] and [[Porter five forces analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbr.org/product/marketing-analysis-toolkit-situation-analysis/an/510079-PDF-ENG|title=Marketing Analysis Toolkit: Situation Analysis|last1=Steenburgh|first1=Thomas|last2=Avery|first2=Jill|publisher=Case Harvard Business Review|accessdate= 4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Marketing Plan]] is created to guide businesses on how to communicate the benefits of their products to the needs of potential customer. The situation analysis is the second step in the marketing plan and is a critical step in establishing a long term relationship with customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?topicId=1073900352|title=Create your marketing strategy|publisher=Business Link|accessdate= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marketing Plan'''
:*Introduction
:* ''Situation analysis''
:* [[Goal|Objectives]]
:* [[Budgeting]]
:* [[Strategy]]
:* [[Execution]]
:* [[Evaluation]]

The situation analysis looks at both the macro-environmental factors that affect many firms within the environment and the micro-environmental factors that specifically affect the firm. The purpose of the situation analysis is to indicate to a company about the organizational and product position, as well as the overall [[business survival|survival]] of the business, within the environment. Companies must be able to summarize opportunities and problems within the environment so they can understand their capabilities within the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netmba.com/marketing/situation/|title=The marketing process|publisher=Business Knowledge Centre|accessdate= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 5C Analysis ==
While a situation analysis is often referred to as the "[[3C's Model|3C analysis]]", the extension to the 5c analysis has allowed businesses to gain more information on the internal, macro-environmental  and micro-environmental factors within the environment. The 5C analysis is considered the most useful and common way to analyze the market environment, because of the extensive information it provides.&lt;ref name=sitan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netmba.com/marketing/situation/|title=Situation Analysis|publisher=Business Knowledge Centre|accessdate= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Company ===
The company analysis involves evaluation of the company's objectives, strategy, and capabilities. These indicate to an organization the strength of the business model, whether there are areas for improvement, and how well an organization fits the external environment.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite paper|first= Gene|last=Anderson|title=Framework for marketing planning|journal=Michigan Business school|date= March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Goal|Goals &amp; Objectives]]: An analysis on the mission of the business, the industry of the business and the stated goals required to achieve the mission.
* Position: An analysis on the [[Marketing strategy]] and the [[Marketing mix]].
* Performance: An analysis on how effectively the business is achieving their stated mission and goals.
* Product line: An analysis on the products manufactured by the business and how successful it is in the market.&lt;ref name=sitan /&gt;

=== Competitors ===
The [[competitor analysis]] takes into consideration the competitors position within the industry and the potential threat it may pose to other businesses. The main purpose of the competitor analysis is for businesses to analyze a competitor's current and potential nature and capabilities so they can prepare against competition. The competitor analysis looks at the following criteria: 
*Identify competitors: Businesses must be able to identify competitors within their industry. Identifying whether competitors provide the same services or products to the same customer base is useful in gaining knowledge of direct competitors. Both direct and indirect competitors must be identified, as well as potential future competitors.
*Assessment of competitors: The competitor analysis looks at competitor goals, mission, strategies and resources. This supports a thorough comparison of goals and strategies of competitors and the organization.
*Predict future initiatives of competitors: An early insight into the potential activity of a competitor helps a company prepare against competition.&lt;ref name=anderson /&gt;

=== Customers ===
Customer analysis can be vast and complicated. Some of the important areas that a company analyzes includes:&lt;ref name=sitan /&gt;
*[[Demographics]]
:*[[Advertising]] that is most suitable for the demographic
:*Market size and potential growth
:*Customer wants and needs
:*[[Motivation]] to buy the product
:*[[Distribution (business)|Distribution]] channels (retail, online, wholesale, etc...)
:*Quantity and frequency of purchase
:*Income level of customer

=== Collaborators ===
Collaborators are useful for businesses as they allow for an increase in the creation of ideas, as well as an increase in the likelihood of gaining more business opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Verganti|first=Roberto |title=Quantity vs. Quality in Collaborations|url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/06/quantity_vs_quality_in_collabo.html|publisher=Hardvard Business Review|accessdate= June 15, 2011 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following type of collaborators are:
:*Agencies: Agencies are the middlemen of the business world. When businesses need a specific worker who specializes in the trade, they go to a recruitment agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=What is an employment agency or temp agency?|url=http://www.settlement.org/sys/faqs_detail.asp?faq_id=4001076|publisher=settlement.org|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*[[Suppliers]]: Suppliers provide raw materials that are required to build products. There are 7 different types of Suppliers: Manufacturers, wholesalers, merchants, franchisors, importers and exporters, independent crafts people and drop shippers. Each category of suppliers can bring a different skill and experience to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Types of Suppliers - The Reseller Network|url=http://www.the-reseller-network.com/content/69/types-of-suppliers/|publisher=reseller network|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*[[Distributors]]: Distributors are important as they are the 'holding areas for inventory'. Distributors can help manage manufacturer relationships as well as handle vendor relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jordan|first=Peter |title=Distribution 25: Supply-Chain Advantages|url=http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/18824902/distribution-25-supply-chain-advantages.htm|publisher=CRN|accessdate=June 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Partnerships: Business partners would share [[asset]]s and [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]], allowing for a new source of capital and skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnership|url=http://www.smallbusiness.wa.gov.au/partnership/|publisher=The Government of Western Australia - Small Business Development Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses must be able to identify whether the collaborator has the capabilities needed to help run the business as well as an analysis on the level of commitment needed for a collaborator-business relationship.&lt;ref name=anderson /&gt;

=== Context ===
To fully understand the business climate and environment, many factors that can affect the business must be researched and understood. An analysis on the climate is also known as the [[PEST analysis]]. The types of climate/environment firms have to analyse are:

:* Political and regulatory environment: An Analysis of how active the government regulates the market with their policies and how it would affect the [[production (economics)|production]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[Sales|sale]] of the [[goods and services]].
:* Economic Environment: An Analysis of trends regarding [[macroeconomics]], such as [[exchange rates]] and [[inflation rate]], can prove to influence businesses.&lt;ref name=sitan /&gt;
:* Social/cultural environment: Interpreting the trends of society,&lt;ref name=sitan /&gt; which includes the study of [[demographics]], [[education]], [[culture]] etc...
:* Technological analysis: An analysis of technology helps improve on old routines and suggest new methods for being cost efficient. To stay competitive and gain an advantage over competitors, businesses must sufficiently understand technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PEST Analysis|url=http://www.netmba.com/strategy/pest/|publisher=NetMBA|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SWOT ==
{{Main|SWOT Analysis}}
A [[SWOT Analysis]] is another method under the situation analysis that examines the ''Strengths'' and ''Weaknesses'' of a company (internal environment) as well as the ''Opportunities'' and ''Threats'' within the market (external environment). A SWOT analysis looks at both current and future situations, where they analyze their current strengths and weaknesses while looking for future opportunities and threats.  The goal is to build on strengths as much as possible while reducing weaknesses. A future threat can be a potential weakness while a future opportunity can be a potential strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapidbi.com/swotanalysis/#IntroductiontoSWOT|title=SWOT Analysis|publisher=Business and Organizational Development Tools, Training, and Services|accessdate= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis helps a company come up with a plan that keeps it prepared for a number of potential scenarios.

== Porter's Five Forces Industry Analysis ==
{{Main|Porter five forces analysis}}

The Porter models involves scanning the environment for threats from competitors and identifying problems early on to minimize threats imposed by competitors. This model can apply for any type of business, from small to larger sized businesses. It is important to take note that the Porter’s five forces model are not just for businesses, but can also be applied to a country to help gain insight into creating a [[competitive advantage]] in the global market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Porter|first=Michael|title=The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy|url=http://hbr.org/2008/01/the-five-competitive-forces-that-shape-strategy/ar/1|publisher=The Harvard Business Review|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate purpose of the Porter's five forces model is to help businesses compare and analyze their profitability and position with the industry against indirect and direct competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Porter's 5 Forces|url=http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/dstools/paradigm/5force.html/ar/1|publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The threat of new entrant: New entrants affect the company’s profits as the consumers have more variety to choose from.
*[[Bargaining power]] of buyers: The companies influence on the buyer to purchase their product or how much the buyer depends on the product being produced by the [[firm]].
*Threat of [[substitute good|substitute]] product of services: more than one firm producing similar or the same product or service.
*Bargaining powers of suppliers: Company dependence on resources the suppliers provide to create their product or services.
*Rival among existing competitors: Rivals fighting to be dominant in the market, to stay in business and maximize profit.

The '''sprouts of capitalism''', '''seeds of capitalism''' or '''capitalist sprouts''' are features of the economy of the late [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and early [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (16th to 18th centuries) that mainland Chinese historians have seen as resembling developments in pre-industrial Europe, and as precursors of a hypothetical indigenous development of [[industrial capitalism]]. [[Korean nationalist historiography]] has also adopted the idea. In China the sprouts theory was denounced during the [[Cultural Revolution]], but saw renewed interest after the economy began to grow rapidly in the 1980s.

==Origins of the idea==
[[File:Mao1939.jpg|thumb|right|Mao in [[Yan'an]], where he edited ''The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party'']]
The Chinese term was first used in the first chapter, "Chinese Society", of ''The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party'', edited by [[Mao Zedong]] in 1939:{{sfnp|Feuerwerker|1961|p=327}}
{{quotation|As China's feudal society had developed a commodity economy, and so carried within itself the seeds of capitalism, China {{not a typo|woul|d of}} herself have developed slowly into a capitalist society even without the impact of foreign capitalism.|''The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party''{{sfnp|Conners|2009|p=117}}}}
Similar ideas had been explored by Chinese Marxists in the 1920s and 1930s, and provided a way of reconciling Chinese history with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s five stages of [[modes of production]]: primitive, slavery, feudal, capitalist and socialist.{{sfnp|Feuerwerker|1961|pp=327–328}}{{sfnp|Dirlik|1982|p=106}}

[[Shang Yue]] and other Chinese historians sought to justify Mao's hypothesis in the 1950s, producing a series of papers collected in two volumes entitled ''Essays on the debate on the sprouts of capitalism in China'' published in 1957 and 1960.{{sfnp|Feuerwerker|1961|p=327}}{{sfnp|Brook|2002|p=150}}
They identified a number of developments in the Chinese economy between the 16th and 18th centuries, including improved farming and handicraft technologies, improvement and expansion of markets, and changes in wage labor relationships.
These developments were compared to earlier changes in European economies, and held to constitute a new proto-capitalist phase of Chinese economic history.{{sfnp|Myers|Wang|2002|pp=643–644}}{{sfnp|Faure|2006|pp=16–17}}
Some versions of the theory held that indigenous development of industrial capitalism was forestalled by the 17th-century Manchu invasion or 19th-century conflicts with European powers such as the [[Opium War]],{{sfnp|Pomeranz|2000|p=206}}
while others believed that the sprouts were always weak and had withered by the 19th century.{{sfnp|Myers|Wang|2002|p=644}}

==Later history of the idea==

These ideas were also explored by Japanese historians of China in the 1950s, though they concluded that a decisive transformation was unlikely.
In 1980 the late-Ming historian Mori Masao said this work "failed to produce satisfactory theoretical results, though it uncovered a wealth of historical facts which had hitherto been unknown".{{sfnp|Brook|2002|pp=151–152}}
Western economic historians have tended to dismiss the suggestion that these developments presaged a capitalist transformation.{{sfnp|Brook|2002|p=150}}{{sfnp|Pomeranz|2000|p=217}}

In China, Shang Yue and the "sprouts" theories were denounced in the [[Anti-rightist Movement]] and [[Cultural Revolution]] for their emphasis on capitalism, and for contradicting Mao's emphasis on Chinese reaction to Western imperialism in the 19th century.{{sfnp|Feuerwerker|1961|p=329}}{{sfnp|Dirlik|1982|p=111}}
The fall of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976 and the [[Chinese economic reform|resurgence of the Chinese economy]] in the 1980s led to renewed Chinese interest in these ideas.{{sfnp|Dirlik|1982|pp=105–106}}{{sfnp|Brook|2002|pp=152–153}}
A notable contribution was the 3-volume ''A History of the Development of Capitalism in China'', by Wu Chengming and colleagues in 1985, with the second volume dealing with the sprouts of capitalism.{{sfnp|Kwan|1998|pp=54–55}}{{sfnp|Faure|2006|p=102}}
Many Chinese historians now accept that the "sprouts" did not amount to a decisive new phase of economic development.{{sfnp|Myers|Wang|2002|p=644}}

Economists such as Philip Huang and Li Bozhong have attacked "sprouts" research and other approaches measuring Chinese economic history against developments in Western Europe. They challenge the underlying assumption of a single path of development reflected by the European experience, and argue that focusing on similarities with Europe distorts the study of Chinese history.{{sfnp|Huang|1991|pp=313–314}}{{sfnp|Li|1998|pp=161–163}}{{sfnp|Ma|2004|p=261}}

== Parallels identified in the sprouts literature ==
[[File:Du Halde - Description de la Chine - Vol 2 feuille 272.jpg|thumb|right|Workers in the porcelain and silk industries (early 18th century)]]
The sprouts researchers tended to identify the expansion of markets with capitalism.{{sfnp|Von Glahn|1996|p=2}}
In an influential study in 1957, Fu Yiling placed the origin of the sprouts in a 16th-century "commercial revolution".{{sfnp|Von Glahn|1996|p=261}}
Chinese exports to the West generated an inflow of silver from the Americas which expanded the money supply, driving the monetization of markets and taxation.{{sfnp|Myers|Wang|2002|pp=589–590}}{{sfnp|Von Glahn|1996|p=2}}
The following centuries saw increased regional specialization and the
integration of rural markets.{{sfnp|Von Glahn|1996|p=2}}

Researchers have pointed to the rise of [[wage labour]] in late Ming and early Qing workshops in textile, paper and other industries.{{sfnp|Faure|2006|p=17}}{{sfnp|Rowe|2002|p=526}}
However, they lacked the production accounting methods found in European factories, achieving large-scale production by using many small workshops, each with a small team of workers under a master craftsman.{{sfnp|Faure|2006|p=18}}

The organization of silk weaving in 18th-century Chinese cities was compared with the [[putting-out system]] used in European textile industries between the 13th and 18th centuries.
As the interregional silk trade grew, merchant houses began to organize manufacture to guarantee their supplies, providing silk to households for weaving as [[piece work]].{{sfnp|Li|1981|pp=50–52}}
In contrast to Europe, where putting-out aimed to harness rural labour to bypass the urban [[guild]] system, the Chinese system was a mechanism of spreading risk.
In addition, although putting-out began much earlier in continental Europe, it was only in the English cotton industry that it led to industrialization.{{sfnp|Li|1981|pp=57–61}}

== Korean historiography ==

[[Korean nationalist historian]]s advanced a "sprouts" theory as a counter to the claim that Korean industrialization was the "offspring" of Japanese industrialization.{{sfnp|Eckert|1996|p=2}}
According to this theory, farmers responded to the 17th-century labour shortage caused by foreign invasions by adopting more efficient farming methods, leading to greater commercialization and proto-industrialization, which was curtailed by the Japanese interference from the late 19th century.{{sfnp|Cha|2004|pp=279–280}}
It became the orthodox theory in school textbooks in both North and South Korea.{{sfnp|Cha|2004|p=278}}
However, since the 1980s South Korean historians have largely discredited the theory.{{sfnp|Cha|2004|pp=278, 288–289}}

'''''Steve Harvey's Funderdome''''' is an American business [[Reality show|reality competition]] show that premiered June 11, 2017 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and produced by [[MGM Television]]. In a format similar to ''[[Shark Tank]]'', the show features two contestants who pitch products to a studio audience which votes on who will get [[seed funding]] for their project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-steve-harvey-working-hard-20161117-story.html|title=How Steve Harvey became the new 'hardest working man in show business'|last=Braxton|first=Greg|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=November 25, 2016|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=French/&gt;

== Format ==
Each show features three competitions between two inventors (or teams of inventors) competing for the same amount of seed funding—$10,000, $20,000, $50,000, or $100,000. One inventor gives a pitch, followed by a short question-and-answer period with Harvey; the process then repeats for the other inventor. After this, the audience votes on which product they would like to see funded.

Before the winner is revealed, both competitors are offered the opportunity to "cash out." Both inventors (or one chosen member from a team) stand next to a button. A series of amounts—which may increase or decrease—are shown on a screen, along with a timer; to cash out at a particular value, a contestant must hit the button before the timer runs out. Most cash out offers are between 5 and 25 percent of the desired amount (e.g., $5,000–$25,000 for inventors seeking $100,000). In some cases, Harvey has revealed the percentages of the vote before giving the inventors the chance to cash out.

There are three possible outcomes for each competition:
* Neither inventor cashes out: The vote winner gets the full amount, while the loser gets nothing.
* Vote loser cashes out: The vote winner gets the full amount, while the loser gets the cash-out amount.
* Vote winner cashes out: The vote winner gets the cash-out amount, while the loser gets nothing.

== International versions ==
Shortly before the show's debut, MGM Worldwide Television Distribution announced that [[TF1]] acquired the rights to the [[France|French]] version of the show.&lt;ref name=French&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/national-geographic-nike-documentary-1202458440/|title=TV News Roundup: MGM TV Sells Steve Harvey’s ‘Funderdome’ Format Rights to French Distributor|last=Rubin|first=Rebecca|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 8, 2017|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Piracy ==
On June 5, 2017, a message from a believed to be [[cybercriminal]] stated that eight episodes of this series were already online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/hackers-steve-harveys-funderdome-dark-overlord-abc-1202107395/|title=Hackers Post ABC’s Steve Harvey Summer Series Online|last=Hipes|first=Patrick|publisher=deadline.com|date=June 5, 2017|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar group had earlier [[Internet leak|leaked]] episodes of ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''. However, ABC had no public comment about the [[copyright infringement|piracy]] of the show, which was not expected to affect the show's viewership because the target audience was considered unlikely to use piracy websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spangler |first1=Todd |title=ABC Won’t Change TV Premiere Plans for Series Stolen and Leaked to Piracy Site |url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/disney-abc-hack-piracy-steve-harveys-funderdome-1202454092/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety.com]] |accessdate=2017-07-16 |date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business experience==
In 2004, Tebogo and her husband established ''Diep K Steel &amp; Aluminum Proprietary Limited''.

In 2008, she resigned from her job at the municipality and went to run her business full-time. The same year, her husband divested from the company.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

'''Tianshui Association''' ({{Lang-ja|天水会}}, pronounced in Japanese "Tensui Kai" and in Chinese "Tianshui Hui") is a mutual assistance [[Professional association|association]] in [[Japan]] of the 300 [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[railway]] [[engineers]] who worked under [[forced labor]] for the construction of the [[Tianshui]]-[[Lanzhou]] Railway, [[Gansu Province]], [[China]].

==General==
[[China Railway Corporation]] in 1950 restarted the construction of the [[Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway]] (354&amp;nbsp;km), now part of [[Longhai Railway]] between [[Lianyungang]] and [[Lanzhou]], and gathered 300 [[Japanese people|Japanese]] former [[South Manchuria Railway]] engineers and others with their families in [[Tianshui]], [[Gansu Province]], to work under [[forced labor]] for this project. The railway was completed in 1952 and those Japanese workers, who were repatriated to Japan in 1953, formed Tianshui Association, a mutual assistance association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.jst.go.jp/experiences/exchange/exchange_1408.html Tianshui Association: China's Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway and Our Recent Activities] (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinanews.com/cul/news/2010/04-16/2230505.shtml Japanese Enjineers Were Given Special Food and Other Preferential Treatment] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Exports of Morocco 2006.png|thumb|right|Moroccan exports in 2006]]
'''Moroccan trade''' is still dominated by its main import and export partner France, although France's share in Moroccan trade is declining, in favour of the US, the [[Persian Gulf]] region and China. If seen as a single entity, the EU is by far Morocco's largest trading partner.

In recent years, Morocco has reduced its dependence on phosphate exports, emerging as an exporter of manufactured and agricultural products, and as a growing tourism destination. However, its competitiveness in basic manufactured goods, such as textiles, is hampered by low labour productivity and high wages. Morocco is dependent on imported fuel and its food import requirement can rise substantially in drought years, as in 2007. Although Morocco runs a structural trade deficit, this is typically offset by substantial services earnings from tourism and large remittance inflows from the diaspora, and the country normally runs a small current-account surplus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/countries/Morocco/profile.cfm?folder=Profile-FactSheet&lt;/ref&gt; 

Morocco signed in 1996 an agreement of association with the [[European Union]] which came into effect in 2000. This agreement, which lies within the scope of the [[Barcelona Conference|Barcelona Process]] (Euro-Mediterranean partnership) started in 1995 and envisages the progressive implementation of a [[free trade area]] planned for 2012.

==Trade with the EU==
Morocco's FTA with the EU, which was signed in 1996, entered into force in 2000 and is being incrementally implemented with the aim of creating an EU-Morocco free trade zone by 2012, noting that the abolition of tariffs on industrial goods has been a boom for Moroccan manufacturers as some 75% of Morocco's exports go to Europe. France is Morocco's largest trading partner, followed by Spain.

===Trade with France===
France is Morocco’s largest trading partner for both imports and exports, controlling more than 60% of foreign direct investment in Morocco.  Morocco has emerged as a major cheap-labour platform for European manufacturers, as well as a commercial trans-shipment point for goods from all around the world passing through the Straits of Gibraltar.  Moroccans’ knowledge of French has also led French banking and call-centre firms to set up service operations in Morocco. 

In October 2007, French President Nicolas Sarkozy travelled to Morocco on an official state visit to King Mohammed VI.  Accompanied by 70 top French business executives, Sarkozy confirmed several billion dollars' worth of contracts for French firms in Morocco.

==Trade with the US==
Moroccan-US trade has risen to $2.3 billion in 2007 from the $1.4 billion since the enforcement of the free trade agreement signed between the 2 countries in 2006, former Moroccan Minister of Trade and Economy Salaheddine Mezouar said in 2007. Mezouar pointed out that Moroccan clothing exports to the USA had increased by 122% in 2006 while perfume sales had grown by 41%, also noting that US investment in Morocco exceeded $1.5 billion, mainly in tourism and clothing. In 2006, Moroccan-US trade was up 44% over 2005. Moroccan exports to the US netted $521.2 million while American exports to Morocco reached $875.5 million, up 67% from 2005. According to the FTA agreement, Morocco can export to the US a duty-free quota of 15 million square meters of finished goods and 500 tonnes of thread and materials made from fibres and cotton from less developed Sub-Saharan African countries. Morocco is looking to expand its textile markets outside the EU due to strong competition after the EU abolished quotas for Asian textiles in January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/newsbriefs/general/2007/05/16/newsbrief-01&lt;/ref&gt; Moroccan exports to the US rose by 25% in 2007, and noted that trade has been facilitated and promoted by the FTA between the 2 countries. The establishment of a direct merchant maritime line between Tangier and ports on the US East coast would be an essential step to taking trade to the next level.

==Trade with China==
Morocco was the 2nd African country to establish diplomatic ties with China since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. "Sino-Moroccan relations have all along developed soundly and stably with friendly cooperation deepening continuously in all fields, thanks to the joint efforts by the leaders and peoples of the 2 countries, no matter how international situation changes,"Wu Bangguo, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, said during his meeting with Abdeloughed Radi, president of Morocco's Chamber of Representatives, in 2005.

In trade and economic cooperation, the volume of bilateral trade has increased incessantly, reaching $1.16 billion US dollars in 2004,"Wu said. Nothing marked results in bilateral cooperation such as in traditional fields like fisheries, agriculture, health and engineering projects. 

The heads of the parliaments of China and Morocco vowed in Rabat in 2005 to work for the further development of bilateral ties in all fields, including trade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/zflt/eng/zxxx/t210622.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade with the Persian Gulf Region==
As part of its economic liberalization policy, Morocco has concluded free trade agreements with GCC countries, thereby lining Morocco with 1 of the largest free trade networks in the world and giving it duty-free access to a huge market.&lt;ref&gt;http://memrieconomicblog.org/bin/content.cgi?article=190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade with Africa==
Morocco's trade with the African countries has jumped from $533 million in 1998 to around $3 billion in 2008, up 460%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.map.ma/eng/sections/home/morocco_s_trade_with/view |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727002335/http://www.map.ma/eng/sections/home/morocco_s_trade_with/view |archivedate=2009-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was facilitated thanks to opening by Morocco's carrier, [[Royal Air Maroc]], of 27 links serving the continent's major cities as well as the existence in Africa of a number of Moroccan operators, especially [[Royal Air Maroc]], mobile operator [[Maroc Telecom]] and [[Attijariwafa Bank]].

== Trade Imbalance ==
Morocco's trade imbalance rose from $86 billion to $118 billion dirhams between 2006 and 2007 – a 26.6% increase bringing the total amount to 17% of GDP. The [[Caisse de dépôt et de gestion]] forecasts that if imports continue to rise faster than exports, the disparity could reach 21% of GDP. 
Foreign Trade Minister Abdellatif Maâzouz said earlier in September that members of the government have agreed to a plan focused on four major areas: a concerted export development strategy, the regulation of imports, market and economic monitoring, and the adaptation of regulations and working practices. 
The plan, Maâzouz said, "will enable us to redress the external trade situation and to reduce Morocco’s trade deficit." The minister added that he expects to see a reversal of the imbalance by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2008/09/22/feature-02&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tsunao Okumura''' (奥村 綱雄 ''Okumura Tsunao''; 5 March 1903 - 7 November 1972) was the president of [[Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.|Nomura Securities]] between 1948 - 1959.  He was seen as the king of [[Japan]]ese [[brokerage firm|stockbroking]] in the 1950s.

As the son of a wealthy confectioner, Okumura showed little ambition from a young age.  At nineteen, he entered [[Kyoto University]] where he enjoyed the softer pleasures offered to a well-to-do college student.  His father gave him 100 yen a month spending money, at a time when twenty yen was enough to enjoy a very comfortable life-style.  Taking his classes lightly, he spent much time in [[Kyoto]]'s dance halls along with other rich young men.  Okumura left university without impressive grades and was rejected by the [[Mitsubishi Bank|Mitsubishi]], [[Mitsui]] and [[Yamaguchi Bank, Ltd.|Yamaguchi]] banks.  He succeeded in entering Nomura's research department by a personal introduction.

==Early career==
His colleagues observed that Okumura was pleasant and self-assured but lacked the hunger that characterised other Nomura executives.  He often came to work late, was despondent and left early.  Shortly after joining Nomura, his parents arranged for him to marry the eldest daughter of a wealthy Osaka landowner.  His marriage into wealth further discouraged his ambition.

In 1935, Okumura made a serious error which nearly cost him his career.  As a research analyst in marketing, Okumura published a secret book for [[investor]]s espousing the merits of purchasing overseas [[bond (finance)|bonds]].  At the time, the [[Bank of Japan]] prohibited the purchase of overseas bonds by the Japanese.  Japan needed all the money it could get to expand its military.  Bank of Japan officials found out about the brochure and consequently reprimanded the then-president of Nomura securities, [[Otogo Kataoka]].  Kataoka furiously ordered Okumura's resignation but was persuaded by other senior colleagues to simply demote Okumura instead.  Disgraced, Okumura was transferred to the registration section.  The registration section, where only women worked, involved hand numbering every security as it was bought and sold.  The only compensation for Okumura there was that the women spoiled him shamelessly.

==Comeback==
Later on, Okumura's book on purchasing overseas bonds put him back in favor with Nomura's senior management, sending his career on an upward path.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

'''Umestan''' is a [[business park]] in [[Umeå]], [[Sweden]].

==Description==
The business park took over these facilities in 1998, when [[Västerbottens regemente]]s' military operations were shut down. [[Umeå Municipality]] bought the entire area in order to create a business-and knowledge center. The buildings were renovated to meet the needs of modern business regarding comfort, environment and IT capabilities. The business park contains about 40 buildings, which have about 120 different tenants. Around 3&amp;nbsp;000 people visit the area every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enterprise and development on historic ground|url=http://umestan.se/om-umestan/english-summary/|work=umestan.se|publisher=Umestan Företagspa|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historik|url=http://umestan.se/om-umestan/historik/|work=umestan.se|publisher=Umestan Företagspa|accessdate=3 May 2014|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Umeå stadsarkiv-1907-I20 under byggnad.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Västerbotten regiment barracks under construction in 1907.]]

'''''Unstoppable: Finding Hidden Assets to Renew the Core and Fuel Profitable Growth''''' is a non-fiction book on business strategy by American business consultant [[Chris Zook]]. This is the third book in his ''Profit from the Core'' trilogy, preceded by ''[[Profit from the Core]]'' released in 2001 and ''[[Beyond the Core]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1422103668|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title =Unstoppable: Finding Hidden Assets to Renew the Core and Fuel Profitable Growth by Chris Zook|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/838110.Unstoppable|publisher=[[goodreads.com]]|title=Unstoppable: Finding Hidden Assets to Renew the Core and Fuel Profitable Growth by Chris Zook|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In previous books in the trilogy, Zook explaines how to expand, exploit, and support the current core of a company's [[business model]]. Firms usually go through a common growth cycle. Initially, they focus their resources on establishing their core businesses and using them against competition. Then, companies should leverage their strengths and move into closely related areas of business. Finally, companies exhaust these opportunities and have to redefine their cores, making hard decisions and launching a necessary transformation. When a company tries to redefine its core, often managers follow one of three paths—they commit ever more deeply to what they currently do, they move into segments where they have no experience, or they merge with some other group to create a new megacompany.

Zook argues that each of those moves has a very small chance of success over the long term. The chances are much better when companies examine what they already have, and then map out how to leverage those hidden assets. Zook divides these assets in three categories: undervalued business platforms, unexploited customer assets, and underutilized capabilities. If the company moves in these areas where it already has experience, it may successfully redefine itself to meet the next growth period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duffbert.com/duffbert/blog.nsf/d6plinks/TDUF-73TNKR|publisher=duffbert.com]|title=Book Review - Unstoppable - Finding Hidden Assets to Renew the Core and Fuel Profitable Growth by Chris Zook|accessdate=2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2007/06/harvard-business-ideacast-46-u|publisher=[[hbr.org]]|title=Unleash Your Hidden Assets|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{quote|In this volume, Zook draws upon an even wider and deeper wealth of research sources that include about fifty interviews, mostly of CEOs. The title is explained by the fact that he and his associates chose to study most closely those companies “that beat the odds. We also analyzed patterns of failure and estimated the odds of success offered by various paths in various situations.” He goes on to observe that all of the success stories built their renewal on their “hidden assets” that had been previously been undervalued, unrecognized, and/or underutilized. “These assets were not central to the strategy of the past, but they held the key to the future. Furthermore, the older and more complex the company, the greater was the likelihood of finding promising hidden assets.” In other words, many companies already “hold most of the cards for “a winning hand” but do not realize it. No company is forever “unstoppable” but most (if not all) companies can take full advantage of the information and counsel Zook provides in this book to find correct answers to all three of these questions achieve core renewal without “leaps to distant and hot new markets, …being the first adopter of a pioneering new strategy,..[or making] a ‘big bang’ acquisition.” In fact, unless a given organization has “beaten the odds” by sustaining profitable growth, it should first define or redefine its core assets and then grow or renew them, before committing any resources to organizational and/or territorial expansion.}}

== Historical development ==
The development of the concept of workflow occurred above a series of loosely defined, overlapping eras.

=== Beginnings in manufacturing ===
The modern history of workflows can be traced to [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]]&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry Gantt]], although the term "workflow" was not in usage as such during their lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=workflow%2Cwork+flow%2C+work-flow&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cworkflow%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cwork%20flow%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cwork%20-%20flow%3B%2Cc0 Ngram Viewer ]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest usages of the term "work flow" was in a railway engineering journal from 1921.&lt;ref name="SaundersBlundstone1921"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence Saunders|author2=S. R. Blundstone|title=The Railway Engineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nBbnAAAAMAAJ|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor and Gantt launched the study of the deliberate, rational organization of work, primarily in the context of manufacturing. This gave rise to [[time and motion studies]].&lt;ref name="ChatfieldVangermeersch2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Chatfield|author-link1 = Michael Chatfield |author2=Richard Vangermeersch|author-link2=Richard Vangermeersch|title=The History of Accounting (RLE Accounting): An International Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmnMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA269|date=5 February 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-67545-6|pages=269–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related concepts include [[job shop]]s and [[queuing systems]] ([[Markov chain]]s).&lt;ref name="Pinedo2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael L. Pinedo|title=Scheduling: Theory, Algorithms, and Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QRiDnuXSnVwC|date=7 January 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4614-2361-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=job+shops%2Cflow+shops%2Cqueuing+systems&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cjob%20shops%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cflow%20shops%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cqueuing%20systems%3B%2Cc0 Ngram Viewer]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1948 book ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' introduced the emerging concepts to the context of family life.

=== Maturation and growth ===
The invention of the [[typewriter]] and the [[copier]] helped spread the study of the rational organization of labor from the manufacturing shop floor to the office. Filing systems and other sophisticated systems for managing physical [[information]] flows evolved. Several events likely contributed to the development of formalized information workflows. First, the field of optimization theory matured and developed [[mathematical optimization]] techniques. For example, Soviet mathematician and economist [[Leonid Kantorovich]] developed the seeds of [[linear programming]] in 1939 through efforts to solve a plywood manufacturer's production optimization issues.&lt;ref name="KatseneliboigenTheSoviet90"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3bYoKUYXaYC&amp;pg=PA410 |chapter=Chapter 17: Nobel and Lenin Prize Laureate L.V.

=== Quality era ===
In the post-war era, the work of [[W. Edwards Deming]] and [[Joseph M. Juran]] led to a focus on quality, initially in Japanese companies, and from the 1980s on a more global level, giving rise to a variety of movements ranging from [[total quality management]] to [[Six Sigma]], then to more qualitative notions of [[business process re-engineering]].&lt;ref name="HammerChampy2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Hammer|author2=James Champy|title=Reengineering the Corporation: Manifesto for Business Revolution, A|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjvGTXgFl6cC|date=13 October 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-180864-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of the quality movement, workflows, in [[knowledge economy]] sectors&lt;ref&gt;Pharma/biotech workflows [http://www.integrify.com/workflow-pharmaceuticals-biotech "Pharma-specific workflows"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Media workflows [http://ceiton.com/CMS/EN/workflow/casestudies.html#Media-Specific "Media-specific workflows"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in manufacturing, became the subject of further scrutiny and optimization efforts. Acknowledgement of the dynamic and changing nature of the demands on workflows came in the form of recognition of the phenomena associated with critical paths and moving bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;Goldratt, Eliyahu M.[https://www.toc-goldratt.com/content/My-Saga-to-Improve-Production "My saga to improve production." MANAGEMENT TODAY-LONDON- (1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[workflow management system]] (WfMS) is a software system for setting up, performing, and monitoring of a defined sequence of processes and tasks, with the broad goals of increasing productivity, reducing costs, becoming more agile, and improving information exchange within an organization.&lt;ref name="ElmagarmidWorkflow12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgSrCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |chapter=Chapter 1: Workflow Management: State of the Art Versus State of the Products |title=Workflow Management Systems and Interoperability |author=Elmagarmid, A.; Di, W. |editor=Dogac, A.; Kalinichenko, L.; Özsu, T.; Sheth, A. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |pages=1–17 |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems may be process-centric or data-centric, and they may represent the workflow as graphical maps. The workflow management system may also include an extensible interface so that external software applications can be integrated and provide support for wide area workflows that provide faster response times and improved productivity.&lt;ref name="ElmagarmidWorkflow12" /&gt;

== Related concepts ==
The concept of workflow is closely related to several fields in [[operations research]] and other areas that study the nature of work, either quantitatively or qualitatively, such as [[artificial intelligence]] (in particular, the sub-discipline of AI planning) and [[ethnography]]. The term "workflow" is more commonly used in particular industries, such as in printing or professional domains such as [[Clinical laboratory|clinical laboratories]], where it may have particular specialized meanings.

# '''Processes''': A process is a more general notion than workflow and can apply to, for example, physical or biological processes, whereas a workflow is typically a process or collection of processes described in the context of work, such as all processes occurring in a machine shop.
# '''Planning and [[Schedule (project management)|scheduling]]''': A plan is a description of the logically necessary, partially ordered set of activities required to accomplish a specific goal given certain starting conditions. A plan, when augmented with a schedule and [[resource allocation]] calculations, completely defines a particular ''instance'' of systematic processing in pursuit of a goal. A workflow may be viewed as an often optimal or near-optimal realization of the mechanisms required to execute the same plan repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Artem M. Chirkin, Sergey V. Kovalchuk | title = Towards Better Workflow Execution Time Estimation | journal = IERI Procedia | volume = 10 | pages = 216–223 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date = 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ieri.2014.09.080 | doi = 10.1016/j.ieri.2014.09.080}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Flow control (data)|Flow control]]''': This is a control concept applied to workflows, to distinguish from static control of buffers of material or orders, to mean a more dynamic control of flow speed and flow volumes in motion and in process. Such orientation to dynamic aspects is the basic foundation to prepare for more advanced job shop controls, such as [[Just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] or just-in-sequence.
# '''In-transit visibility''': This monitoring concept applies to transported material as well as to work in process or work in progress, i.e., workflows.

== Examples ==
[[File:Business Process Modelling Workflow Schematic.svg|thumb|Business Process Modelling]]
The following examples illustrate the variety of workflows seen in various contexts:

# In machine shops, particularly [[job shop]]s and flow shops, the flow of a part through the various processing stations is a workflow.
# Insurance claims processing is an example of an information-intensive, document-driven workflow.&lt;ref name="HaveyEssential05"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtabAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255 |chapter=Chapter 10: Example: Human Workflow in Insurance Claims Processing |title=Essential Business Process Modeling |author=Havey, M. |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc |year=2005 |page=255–284 |isbn=9780596008437 |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Wikipedia editing can be modeled as a stochastic workflow.
# The [[Getting Things Done]] system is a model of personal workflow management for information workers.
# In software development, support and other industries, the concept of ''[[follow-the-sun]]'' describes a process of passing unfinished work across time zones.&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/services/hardware/info/hw_globalsupportctr_59829873EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# In traditional offset and digital printing, the concept of workflow represents the process, people, and usually software technology (RIPs raster image processors or DFE digital front end) controllers that play a part in pre/post processing of print-related files, e.g., PDF pre-flight checking to make certain that fonts are embedded or that the imaging output to plate or digital press will be able to render the document intent properly for the image-output capabilities of the press that will print the final image.
# In scientific experiments, the overall process (tasks and data flow) can be described as a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG). This DAG is referred to as a workflow, e.g., Brain Imaging workflows.&lt;ref&gt;Brain Image Registration Analysis Workflow for fMRI Studies on Global Grids, [http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/AINA.2009.13 Computer.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A grid workflow environment for brain imaging analysis on distributed systems, [http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/cpe.1461 Wiley.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
# In healthcare data analysis, a workflow can be used to represent a sequence of steps which compose a complex data analysis (data-search and data-manipulation steps).&lt;ref name=hf2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huser | first1 = V. | last2 = Rasmussen | first2 = L.

== Features and phenomenology ==
# Modeling:  Workflow problems can be modeled and analyzed using [[graph theory|graph]]-based formalisms like [[Petri net]]s.
# Measurement: Many of the concepts used to measure scheduling systems in [[operations research]] are useful for measuring general workflows. These include throughput, processing time, and other regular metrics.
# Specialized connotations: The term "workflow" has specialized connotations in information technology, [[document management]], and [[Document imaging|imaging]]. Since 1993, one trade consortium specifically focused on workflow management and the interoperability of workflow management systems, the [[Workflow Management Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wfmc.org/index.php/about-us |title=Introduction to the Workflow Management Coalition |publisher=Workflow Management Coalition |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Scientific workflow system]]s: Have found wide acceptance in the fields of [[bioinformatics]] and [[cheminformatics]] in the early 2000s, where they successfully meet the need for multiple interconnected tools that handle multiple data formats and large data quantities. Also, the paradigm of scientific workflows resembles the well-established tradition of [[Perl]] programming in life science research organizations, making this adoption a natural step towards more structured infrastructure setup.
# Human-machine interaction: Several conceptualizations of mixed-initiative workflows have been studied, particularly in the military, where automated agents play roles just as humans do. For innovative, adaptive, and collaborative human work, the techniques of [[human interaction management]] are required.
# Workflow analysis: Workflow systems allow users to develop executable processes with no familiarity with formal programming concepts. Automated workflow analysis techniques can help users analyze the properties of user workflows to conduct verification of certain properties before executing them, e.g., analyzing flow control or data flow. Examples of tools based on formal analysis frameworks have been developed and used for the analysis of scientific workflows and can be extended to the analysis of other types of workflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curcin | first1 = V. | last2 = Ghanem | first2 = M. | last3 = Guo | first3 = Y. | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2010.0157 | title = The design and implementation of a workflow analysis tool | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume = 368 | issue = 1926 | pages = 4193 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2010RSPTA.368.4193C | url = https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/60972131/4193.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workflow improvement theories ==
Several workflow improvement theories have been proposed and implemented in the modern workplace. These include:

# [[Six Sigma]]
# [[Total Quality Management]]
# [[Business Process Reengineering]]
# [[Lean manufacturing|Lean]] systems
# [[Theory of Constraints]]

Evaluation of resources, both physical and human, is essential to evaluate hand-off points and potential to create smoother transitions between tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating A Performance Based Culture In Your Workplace|last=Alvord|first=Brice|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=1105576078|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
A workflow can usually be described using formal or informal flow diagramming techniques, showing directed flows between processing steps. Single processing steps or components of a workflow can basically be defined by three parameters:
#input description: the information, material and energy required to complete the step
#transformation rules: [[algorithm]]s which may be carried out by people or machines, or both
#output description: the information, material, and energy produced by the step and provided as input to downstream steps

Components can only be plugged together if the output of one previous (set of) component(s) is equal to the mandatory input requirements of the following component(s). Thus, the essential description of a component actually comprises only input and output that are described fully in terms of [[data type]]s and their meaning ([[semantics]]). The algorithms' or rules' descriptions need only be included when there are several alternative ways to transform one type of input into one type of output – possibly with different accuracy, speed, etc.

When the components are non-local services that are invoked remotely via a computer network, such as [[Web service]]s, additional descriptors (such as [[Quality of service|QoS]] and [[availability]]) also must be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = D. Kyriazis| title = An innovative workflow mapping mechanism for Grids in the frame of Quality of Service | journal = Future Generation Computer Systems | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 498–511 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date = June 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2007.07.009 | doi = 10.1016/j.future.2007.07.009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
{{main|Workflow application}}
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
Many software systems exist to support workflows in particular domains. Such systems manage tasks such as automatic routing, partially automated processing, and integration between different functional software applications and hardware systems that contribute to the value-addition process underlying the workflow. There are also software suppliers using the technology [[process driven messaging service]] based upon three elements{{Citation needed|reason=Couldn't find a source for any of this, and main article has no citations as well.|date=January 2018}}:

It is located on Boris Yeltsin Street on the embankment of the [[Iset River]] and is currently under development. The area occupies five [[hectares]].

The project's architectural planning and design belonged to French architectural bureau [[ValoDia and Pistre]]. The project's primary investor is [[UMMK-Holding]]. Construction would be responsible to Deputy Mayor for Construction and Architecture, Vladimir Kritskii. The project combines about 450,000 square meters of commercial space, offices, hotels, entertainment centers, cafes, and restaurants. The plans include 12 buildings: four office towers, a commercial area to accommodate typical small and average-sized businesses, a so-called trading gallery and two hotels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
