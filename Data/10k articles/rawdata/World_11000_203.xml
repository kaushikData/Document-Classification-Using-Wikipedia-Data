The '''2016 Minya pogrom''' was a [[pogrom]] in a village in [[Minya Governorate]], [[Egypt]], by a Muslim mob against the [[Copts|Coptic]] community. The pogrom was instigated by a rumor that a Christian man and a Muslim woman were in a relationship. The mob ransacked and torched seven Christian homes. The mother of the Christian man was stripped naked and was paraded through the village to humiliate her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hendawi |first=Hamza |date=26 May 2016 |title=Muslim Mob Attacks Christian Homes in Egypt |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2016-05-26/muslim-mob-attacks-christian-homes-in-egyptian-province |newspaper=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |location=Cairo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527012317/http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2016-05-26/muslim-mob-attacks-christian-homes-in-egyptian-province |archive-date=26 May 2016 |access-date=26 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abbichu Oromo''' are one of the Tulema sub clans who live in [[North Shewa Zone (Amhara)|Semen Shewa]] zone in [[Ethiopia]]. In 1841 William Harris mentioned them as allies of King [[Sahle Selassie|Sahle Silassie]] of Shewa. The prominent settlements and towns are Lami, [[Meniida|Mendida]], Jiru, Robe, Deneba, Enewari and Chacha.

== History ==
The [[Commander-in-chief|commander in chief]] of his army, Ayto Mirach, was from this clan. At that time they inhabited the land north of Galan tribe, South of [[Menz]], west of Karayyu and east of [[Merhabete|Marhabiete]]. They became Christian in the 1830s, thus connecting the two [[Amhara people|Amhara]] dominions. The capital city of the tribe was Angolala. This tribe of [[Oromo language|Oromo]] were [[Amharic]] speakers and their territory joined the Amhara region.

The '''Apulo-Calabrese''' is a [[breed]] of black domestic [[pig]] from [[Calabria]], in southern Italy.{{r|dad}} It may also be known as the '''Calabrese''', '''Nero Calabrese''' or '''Nero di Calabria''', and by many other regional names. It derives from the old Pugliese pig breed of [[Puglia]], which in turn derives from the [[Casertana (pig)|Casertana]] breed of [[Campania]]; it is closely related to that breed. The Apulo-Calabrese is one of the six autochthonous pig breeds recognised by the [[Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali]], the Italian ministry of agriculture and forestry.{{r|anas}}

==History==
The Apulo-Calabrese is particularly associated with the [[provinces of Italy|provinces]] of  [[Province of Catanzaro|Catanzaro]], [[Province of Cosenza|Cosenza]] and [[Province of Reggio Calabria|Reggio di Calabria]],{{r|bigi}} and with the area of [[Lagonegro]] in the [[province of Potenza]]. In the early 20th century, local sub-types from these areas were known as the Catanzarese, the Cosentina, the Reggitana and the Lagonegrese respectively; these types are now considered extinct.{{r|barb}} The Calabrese was the principal pig of the region; in the mid-1920s the population was recorded as 131,736. Numbers fell drastically after the [[Second World War]], and in particular from the 1970s, following the introduction of faster-growing foreign breeds such as the British [[Yorkshire pig|Yorkshire]]. 

A herdbook was established in 2001,{{r|dm}} and is kept by the Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Suini, the Italian national association of pig breeders. The population remains low: at the end of 2007 it was 499,{{r|bigi}} and conservation status of the breed was listed as "endangered-maintained" by the [[FAO]] in the same year.{{r|barb}} In 2012 total numbers were reported to be 2198.{{r|anas2}}

The '''Democratic Union Afar''' (UDA) was a political party of the [[French Territory of the Afars and the Issas]].

==History==
Created by 1960-1961 to Orbiss Gaddito and Mohamed Kamil Mohamed, in 1962 it also brings [[Ali Aref Bourhan]] and [[Ahmed Dini]]. The UDA wins local elections in 1963. In 1965, Ali Aref leaves the UDA, he lost control, to create the Democratic Rally Afar (RDA). The UDA is close to the Party of Popular Movement (PMP) with which it organizes the independence demonstration in August 1966. But then the two teams away.

In 1967, the UDA participated in the territorial elections. It supports the maintenance of the territory under French sovereignty in the March 1967 referendum.

The '''Eglisau–Neuhausen railway line''' is a cross-border railway line in Europe. 

==Description==
The line links [[Eglisau]] in the Swiss [[canton of Zurich]] with the [[Schaffhausen|city of Schaffhausen]] in the Swiss [[canton of Schaffhausen]], crossing some {{convert|8|km}} of the German state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] in between. It thus crosses the [[Germany–Switzerland border]] twice.&lt;ref name=edsp110&gt;{{cite book | title = Eisenbahnatlas Deutschland | year = 2009 | publisher = Verlag Schweers + Wall GmbH | isbn=978-3-89494-139-0 | pages = 110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line is {{convert|17.88|km}} long, standard gauge and electrified at {{15 kV AC}} supplied by [[overhead line]]. The section between Hüntwangen-Wil and Rafz is double track, whilst the rest of the line is single track.&lt;ref name=edsp110/&gt;

Schaffhausen was first connected to the Swiss railway system in 1857 with the opening of the [[Rheinfall Railway]]. Whilst this line was entirely on Swiss soil, and provided a direct link to the [[Winterthur|city of Winterthur]], it only provided a rather indirect route to the rest of Switzerland and the [[Gotthard Railway]]. The [[Swiss Northeastern Railway]] therefore constructed the Eglisau to Neuhausen line, which opened in 1897.

The construction of the line involved the building of several civil engineering structures, including the {{convert|439|m}} [[Eglisau railway bridge]] across the [[Rhine]] at the southern end of the line. At the northern end of the line, two tunnels were necessary, with lengths of {{convert|112|m}} and {{convert|144|m}}.

The whole line, including the section in Germany, now belongs to the [[Swiss Federal Railways]], and is subject to Swiss rail regulations and Swiss domestic rail fares.&lt;ref name=edsp110/&gt; Besides the junction stations of [[Eglisau railway station|Eglisau]] and [[Neuhausen railway station|Neuhausen]], there are five intermediate stations, of which three are in Switzerland and two in Germany. A sixth intermediate station, at Altenburg-Rheinau, was closed in 2011, whilst the [[Neuhausen Rheinfall railway station|Neuhausen Rheinfall]] station was opened in 2015.

The line carries an hourly service of long-distance passenger trains between [[Zurich]] and Schaffhausen, with some trains operating as far as [[Frankfurt]] and [[Bern]]. Trains on the [[Zurich S-Bahn]] line [[S9 (ZVV)|S9]] operate half-hourly from Zurich as far as [[Rafz]] (just before the German border), with alternate trains continuing to Schaffhausen. Schaffhausen S-Bahn line S22 provides a local service from [[Jestetten]] to Schaffhausen.&lt;ref name=zvv-ln&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.zvv.ch/content/dam/zvv/fahrplan/pdf/sbahn_A3_2017_rgb.pdf |title=S-Bahn trains, buses and boats |publisher=ZVV |accessdate=18 September 2018 | deadurl=no |archivedate=18 September 2018 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918165540/https://www.zvv.ch/content/dam/zvv/fahrplan/pdf/sbahn_A3_2017_rgb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tt-760&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/fileadmin/fap_pdf_fields/2018/760.pdf |title=Schaffhausen–Bülach–Zürich |publisher=Bundesamt für Verkehr |accessdate=18 September 2018 |deadurl=no | archivedate=18 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918164757/http://www.fahrplanfelder.ch/fileadmin/fap_pdf_fields/2018/760.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freight trains also use the line between Germany and the Gotthard route.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 20 February 2015, [[Rafz train crash|a collision occurred]] between an [[Interregio]] train and an [[S-Bahn]] train at {{rws|Rafz}}.

'''Ethiopian-Greek relations''' are the international relations between [[Ethiopia]] and [[Greece]].  Although the first Greek diplomatic mission in Ethiopia dates to 1917 with the creation of a Greek Consulate, immigrants from Greece have been present in Ethiopia in the service of the Emperor or nobility since at least the mid-18th century.  In 1935 the consulate was upgraded to an embassy.  From 1951 to 1992, Ethiopia had an embassy in [[Athens]] but was forced to close it due to economic reasons; since that time, Ethiopia has reopened its embassy in Athens.

Although the two countries signed trade agreements in 1933, 1955, and 1959, the volume of trade between them remains very low. The Greek [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Theodoros Pangalos (politician)|Theodoros Pangalos]], made a formal visit to Ethiopia in 1998. The nationalization of properties owned by Greek nationals in Ethiopia during the [[Derg]] regime is a factor in the relationship between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.et/Foreign_Policy_And_Relation/Bilateral.php "Bilateral relations"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325095640/http://www.mfa.gov.et/Foreign_Policy_And_Relation/Bilateral.php |date=March 25, 2012 }}, Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (accessed 28 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

It aims to organize multiple actions during a single week, across Europe, that will raise awareness about [[waste reduction]]. Each year, the most outstanding actions are rewarded during an awards ceremony in Brussels at the heart of the European institutions. Since the beginning of the project, more than 20.000 awareness raising actions on waste prevention have been implemented in the framework of the EWWR.

The 2017 date is from November 18-27.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewwr.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The five partners of this project are:
* '''ADEME''' (the French Environment and Energy Management Agency – project coordinator)
* '''ACR+''' (the Association of Cities and Regions for Recycling and sustainable Resource management – project technical secretariat)
* '''ARC''' (the Catalan Waste Agency)
* '''IBGE''' (Brussels Environment, public administration for the environment and energy)   and
* '''LIPOR''' (the Intermunicipal Waste Management Service of [[Greater Porto]]).

==Purpose==
* To raise awareness about waste reduction strategies and about the policies of the European Union and its Member States on this subject
* To promote sustainable waste reduction actions across Europe
* To highlight the work accomplished by various actors, through concrete examples of waste reduction
* To encourage changes in the behaviour of Europeans (consumption, production) in everyday life

==Target audience==
* '''Public authorities across Europe''' that have competence in the field of waste prevention that responded to a Call for Interest launched by the official partners of the project. These EWWR Organisers act as coordinators of the Week in the area covered by their authority, thereby ensuring the registration and validation of actions proposed by various Project Developers.
* '''Project developers''' interested in carrying out awareness raising actions on the subject of waste prevention during the Week, with the aim of informing the greatest possible number of citizens. These Project Developers register their proposals for EWWR actions through the national, regional or local Organiser covering their area.
:'''5 categories of Project Developer:'''
** Administration/public authority
** Association/NGO
** Business/industry
** Educational establishment
** Other (for example : hospital, retirement home, cultural centre etc.).
* '''European citizens''' who participate in actions set up by Project Developers during the Week and learn about the kind of waste reduction habits that they can take up in everyday life.

==Five themes of the EWWR==
* Too much waste
* Better production
* Better consumption
* A longer life for products
* Less waste thrown away

The '''fathers' rights movement''' (a movement dedicated to achieving equal rights to custody of children) in [[Italy]] consists of a number of diverse pressure groups, ranging from charities (defined as [[ONLUS]] in the [[Italian Law]]) and self-help groups to [[civil disobedience]] activists, who started to obtain wide publicity in 2003.
{{Masculism sidebar |bycountry}}
The movement's origin can be traced to 1984 when Papa' Separati was founded in [[Emilia-Romagna|Emilia]]. At the local level, many activists spend much time providing support for newly separated fathers, most of whom are highly distraught. Although some have been accused of being [[sexist]] by some commentators and family lawers, these groups also campaign for better treatment for excluded mothers, women in second marriages, other [[step-parent]]s and grandparents - all of whom claim to suffer from discrimination regarding custody and/or visitation with their child(ren) and grandchild(ren).

The most important charities in Italy which have formed a federation called [[Fe.N.Bi]] and an activist movement called [[Armata dei padri]] are:

*[[Papa' Separati]]
*[[Figli Negati]]

The '''flag of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]''' ({{lang-el|Σημαία της Μακεδονίας}}) represents a [[Vergina Sun]] with 16 rays extending from the blue field. The Vergina Sun on a blue background is commonly used as an unofficial flag of the [[Macedonia (Greece)#Local government|three peripheries]], the prefectures and the municipalities of  Macedonia. It is also used by organisations of the [[Macedonians (Greek)|Macedonian Greek]] diaspora, such as the Pan-Macedonian Associations of the [[United States]] and [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panmacedonian.info/|title=Pan-Macedonian Association USA|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macedonia.com/english/history/|title=History of Macedonia|publisher=Pan-Macedonian Network|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panmacedonian.com.au/|title=Pan Macedonian Association of Melbourne and Victoria|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as numerous commercial enterprises.

Although the [[Vergina Sun]] is an official state emblem of Greece&lt;ref name=WIPO&gt;WIPO registrations: [http://www.wipo.int/branddb/en/showData.jsp?ID=6TER.GR0001 1], [http://www.wipo.int/branddb/en/showData.jsp?ID=6TER.GR0002 2], [http://www.wipo.int/branddb/en/showData.jsp?ID=6TER.GR0003 3].  &lt;/ref&gt;, no such provisions have been made for the flag of Macedonia, which remains unofficial.

It is unclear when the flag was adopted, but it was most likely in use by the late 1980s after the archaeological discovery of the star by [[Manolis Andronikos]] in [[Vergina]].&lt;ref name="Flag Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |last= Znamierowski |first= Alfred |title=The World Encyclopedia of Flags |publisher= Anness Publishings |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-1-84476-895-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity of the first flag of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in 1992 after it seceded from [[Yugoslavia]], which had the same design but on a red background with proportions 1:2, caused controversy in Greece, which was already using that symbol for its own province of Macedonia, and the Republic of Macedonia changed its flag to the current design.&lt;ref name="Flag Encyclopedia" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2284">The '''Forest Principles''' (also ''Rio Forest Principles'') is the informal name given to the ''Non-Legally Binding Authoritative Statement of Principles for a Global Consensus on the Management, Conservation and Sustainable Development of All Types of Forests'' (1992), a document produced at the [[United Nations]] Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), informally known as the [[Earth Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf151/aconf15126-3annex3.htm  United Nations: Forest Principles.]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a non-[[legally binding]] document that makes several recommendations for conservation and sustainable development [[forestry]].

At the Earth Summit, the negotiation of the document was complicated by demands by [[developing nation]]s in the [[Group of 77]] for increased [[foreign aid]] in order to pay for the setting aside of forest reserves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/projects/hfi/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Developed nation]]s resisted those demands, and the final document was a compromise.

The [[FOREST EUROPE]] process (Ministerial Conferences on the Protection of Forests in Europe, MCPFE) was started by Strasbourg Conference in 1990 and the Forest Principles were adopted and incorporated into the agenda by Helsinki Conference in 1993. The process covers Pan-European region consisting of 47 signatories (46 European countries and the European Union) that partially overlaps with [[Montréal Process]] region (Russia is a signatory of both processes).

The Montréal Process, also known as the ''Working Group on Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Temperate and Boreal Forests'', was started in 1994 as a  result of the Forest Principles.

'''Grímsstaðir''' is a settlement in north-east [[Iceland]] whose main claim to fame is that its weather station holds the [[List of weather records|low-temperature record]] for Iceland of -38°C: no doubt due to its sheltered location (at altitude of about 400 metres) between two upland areas (above 800 metres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Íslensk veðurmet|url=http://www.vedur.is/vedur/vedurfar/upplysingar/vedurmet/|website=vedur.is|publisher=Icelandic Met Office|language=Icelandic|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its recent records was recorded on December 8, 2013, when the temperature fell at -24,2°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}}http://www.meteogiornale.it/notizia/30352-1-grande-gelo-nord-europa-30-gradi-sotto-zero&lt;/ref&gt;

It is situated just off [[Route 1 (Iceland)|Route 1]] (the main ring road around the island), where it crosses the large river [[Jökulsá á Fjöllum]], about 37&amp;nbsp;km or 23 miles east of Lake [[Mývatn]]. The river was bridged in 1947: before that, traffic between north and east Iceland had to use a ferry. 

Currently the settlement has some accommodation for tourists, with discussions for growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/world/europe/iceland-baffled-by-chinese-plan-for-golf-resort.html  ''Teeing Off at Edge of the Arctic? A Chinese Plan Baffles Iceland''] March 22, 2013 [[New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; It also has an airstrip, in common with many isolated rural settlements in Iceland. It is a recognised stop on the bus route between [[Akureyri]] and [[Egilsstaðir]] (up to one bus per day in summer) although it is only during summer that the buses venture off the main road to the settlement itself.

'''Les Révoires''' is a north eastern residential and tourist area; part of the traditional ''Quartier'' of [[La Condamine]] in the [[Principality of Monaco]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.gouv.mc/devwww/wwwnew.nsf/1909$/dfb8c2ae4774e8d9c12575ac0046c0e5gb?OpenDocument&amp;Count=10000&amp;InfoChap Census]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the ten modern administrative ''Wards'' of Monaco.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Geography==
Les Révoires lies on the northwestern side of the country, just north of [[Moneghetti]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.visitmonaco.com/us/About-Monaco/Geography Monaco - Geography / About Monaco / Monaco Official Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Les Révoires is generally considered part of Moneghetti, even though it is its own administrative ''Ward''. It runs directly along the neighboring French towns of [[Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritimes|Beausoleil]], and [[Cap-d'Ail]], as well as the Monégasque ''Wards'' of, [[La Colle, Monaco|La Colle]], and [[Moneghetti]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://monaco.me/monaco/monaco-districts/ Districts of Monaco]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Quartièrs de Mónegue.svg|Wards of Monaco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Les Révoires has [[Grade (slope)|steep inclines]], and offers views of the [[Rock of Monaco]] and the [[Mediterranean]]. Les Révoires is also the location of the [[Chemin des Révoires]], Monaco's highest point, 161 m above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitoc.mit.edu/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=290389 Chemin des Révoires]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Les Révoires is the smallest ''Ward'' in Monaco in terms of both population and land mass.
Les Révoires has a population of 2,545 and is 0.09&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gouv.mc/Action-Gouvernementale/L-Economie/Analyses-et-Statistiques/Publications/Monaco-Statistiques-Pocket Census 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Monaco has ten [[Monaco#Education|state-operated schools]], four private schools, and one [[International University of Monaco|university]]. There are no state schools and private schools located in this district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/monaco/how-to/monaco-family-schooling-education|title=Schooling and Education in Monaco|website=Angloinfo Monaco|publisher=[[Angloinfo]]|access-date=2016-06-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807222146/https://www.angloinfo.com/monaco/how-to/monaco-family-schooling-education|archivedate=2016-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also very few government offices located in this district, although there is a regional [[Law enforcement in Monaco|police]] station near the Les Révoires - Moneghetti border.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gouv.mc/Gouvernement-et-Institutions/Le-Gouvernement/Departement-de-l-Interieur/Direction-de-la-Surete-Publique Police Stations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
Les Révoires is more of residential area, but there are many chain-owned [[hotels]], and [[bed &amp; breakfast]]s, along the upper slopes of [[Mont Agel]], helping Monaco's high end tourist industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.booking.com/country/mc.html?aid=306395;label=mc-G*3VOPIsp09*yFRbK_VPIQS9014594549:pl:ta:p1:p2:ac:ap1t1:neg;ws=&amp;gclid=CI6cm9Xb-rMCFdKd4Aod4U0AlQ Hotels]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landmarks==
Because Les Révoires is located outside the city center, its real estate sales are generally less.&lt;ref name=autogenerated114&gt;[http://www.montecarlo-realestate.com/en/maps/?type_transaction=locations&amp;idQuartier=7 Real Estate Monaco Les Révoires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate sales average 6% to 10% less than neighboring [[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]] or [[La Condamine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montecarlo-realestate.com/en/quartiers/ Real Estate Monaco&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The district contains the celebrated [[Jardin Exotique de Monaco]] ([[French language|French]]: for Exotic Garden of Monaco), founded by [[Prince Albert I]] in 1933. The garden contains a rich collection of over a thousand [[succulent]] and [[cacti]]. There is also a museum, called the ''Prehistoric Anthropology'' located within the Exotic Garden, which displays a variety of prehistoric remains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jardin-exotique.mc/fr/presentation-du-jardin-exotique/ Le Jardin Exotique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226181240/http://www.jardin-exotique.mc/fr/presentation-du-jardin-exotique |date=2012-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11107">This is a list of the native wild '''mammal species recorded in Antarctica'''. There are 23 mammal species in [[Antarctica]], all of which are [[Marine mammal|marine]]. Three of these species are considered to be [[Endangered species|endangered]], one to be [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]], eight are listed as data deficient and one has not yet been evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.&lt;/ref&gt; Domesticated species, such as the dogs formerly present,&lt;ref name="Mills2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=William J.

====Superorder [[Laurasiatheria]]====

=====Order: Carnivora (carnivorans)=====
----

[[File:Crabeater Seal in Pléneau Bay, Antarctica.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Crabeater seal]]]]

There are over 260 species of carnivorans, the majority of which feed primarily on meat. They have a characteristic skull shape and dentition. The southern elephant seal is believed to be the largest carnivoran of all time; bulls typically weigh {{convert|2,200|to|4,000|kg|lk=out|abbr=off}}. The [[lobodontine seals]] comprise about 80% of the global [[biomass]] of pinnipeds, a reflection of the high productivity of the [[Southern Ocean]]; all have circumpolar distributions surrounding Antarctica and breed on [[pack ice]] or [[shore-fast ice]]. [[Antarctic fur seal]]s and [[southern elephant seal]]s, in contrast, while doing much of their feeding at the edge of the continent, breed on [[subantarctic]] islands, such as [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. Warmblooded prey makes up a significant proportion of the [[leopard seal]]'s diet, and is occasionally taken by Antarctic fur seals.

=====Order: Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates and cetaceans)=====

======Infraorder: Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises)======

[[File:Killerwhales jumping.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Orca]]]]

The infraorder Cetacea includes [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s. They are the mammals most fully [[aquatic adaptation|adapted to aquatic]] life with a spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by a thick layer of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater. Their closest extant relatives are the [[Hippopotamidae|hippos]], which are [[artiodactyl]]s, from which cetaceans descended; cetaceans are thus also artiodactyls.

The hunting of baleen whales in the vicinity of Antarctica began around 1904, with the establishment of a whaling station on [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. Hunting of blue whales was banned in 1966, and finally brought under control in the 1970s. By that time the blue whale population had been [[overexploitation|reduced to 0.15% of its original size]].&lt;ref name = Ant&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Branch |first1=T.

{{Ethnic Macedonians}}
A '''Macedonian Argentine''' is an [[Argentine people|Argentine citizen]] of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] descent or a Macedonia-born person who resides in [[Argentina]]. Most of Macedonian Argentines are descendants of ethnic Macedonians from [[Bulgaria]], followed by those from [[Greece]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Argentina is home to one of the largest Macedonian communities in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.mk//Upload/ContentManagement/Files/Broj%20na%20makedonski%20iselenici%20vo%20svetot.doc Population Estimate from the MFA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930042306/http://www.mfa.gov.mk//Upload/ContentManagement/Files/Broj%20na%20makedonski%20iselenici%20vo%20svetot.doc |date=2011-09-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Included are [[Aromanians]] and [[Megleno-Romanians]], who became adjusted to Argentine society because of the linguistic similarities between [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], as well as the [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin identity]] of Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians.

Many Macedonian Argentines are the descendants of the "pečalbari" (seasonal workers) who came to [[Argentina]] in the early 20th century. Many decided to stay in the country, setting up [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] colonies in the Pampas and other regions. Most Macedonians can be found in [[Buenos Aires]], the [[Pampas]] and [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]]. An estimated 30,000 Macedonians live in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Nasevski, Boško; Angelova, Dora. Gerovska, Dragica (1995). Македонски Иселенички Алманах '95.

The '''Mrazig''' are a previously nomadic people who live in and around the town of [[Douz]], [[Tunisia]]. Numbering around 50,000, they are the descendants of the [[Banu Sulaym]] tribe who left the [[Arabian peninsula]] in the eighth century. They lived first in [[Egypt]], then [[Libya]], and finally arrived and settled in Tunisia in the thirteenth century.

'''Nansen Dialogue''' is the name of a project initially created at the [[Nansen Academy]] in [[Lillehammer]] in 1995, as a counter-reaction to the fact that when Lillehammer was hosting the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] there was a [[Bosnian War|war]] in process in the former Winter Olympics City of [[Sarajevo]]. The former head master of the Nansen Academy, Inge Eidsvåg, visited the rehabilitation ward for war injuries of the Kosovo Hospital in Sarajevo in 1994, and this visit triggered the idea of the Nansen Dialogue Project.

"I visited the  rehabilitation ward for war injuries of the Kosovo Hospital in Sarajevo in 1994. This was before the [[Dayton Agreement]] and at the time Sarajevo was under siege. The five days I spent there made a big impression on me, and as soon as I was back in Norway I got in touch with the [[Norwegian Red Cross]] and the [[Norwegian Church Aid]] to suggest a joint project called "[[Democracy]], Human Rights and Peaceful Conflict Handling", to which they agreed.

A few weeks later on we had worked out a temporary program and applied for financial support from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. They decided to offer their support and later on the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo|Peace Research Institute]] (PRIO) was invited to join in. In September 1995 we were able to welcome the first group of students from the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Within a year we had turned an idea into reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://peace.no/norsk-hvem-vi-er/norsk-nansen-fredssenter/nar/|title=Timeline|newspaper=Peace|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the project consisted solely of dialogue seminars in Lillehammer, but the participants felt that even if the dialogue seminars were helpful as they were the fact that only a privileged few could participate made it less successful than it could have been, given another structure. A Serbian and an Albanian woman who'd participated in the seminars decided to set up a Nansen Dialogue Center in [[Pristina]] in 1997. They set up dialogue seminars and invited both Albanians and Serbs from Kosovo to participate, and kept it up until the spring of 1999, when [[NATO]] bombs falling over Yugoslavia and Kosovo put a temporary end to them. The Center re-opened in 2000, and that year additional centers were opened in [[Podgorica]], [[Skopje]] and [[Belgrade|Beograd]]. During the fall new Centers opened in Bosnia – Herzegovina, Sarajevo, Mostar and Banja Luka, and in 2001 in Osijek and Mestrovic. In 2005 the Bujanovac Center opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nansen-dialogue.net/index.php/en/|title=Home - Nansen Dialogue Network|website=nansen-dialogue.net|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are 10 Dialogue Centers employing more than 60 people. They work with dialogue between [[Ethnic group|ethnic groups]] who have previously been at war. More than 150 separate dialogue seminars between former enemies from conflicted areas has been held at the Nansen Academy premises, and it is still possible to attend workshops in Lillehammer. In addition to working with the former Yugoslavia the Nansen Center for Peace and Dialogue has expanded their efforts to include participants from other conflicted areas, such as the Middle East, and the Horn of Africa. Steinar Bryn is in charge of the project.

Nansen Dialogue was merged with the Norwegian Peace Centre in 2010 into a new entity called the Nansen Center for Peace and Dialogue.

The Norwegian Peace Centre was founded in 1988, and the main focus of the establishment was to create a venue for [[peace]] work, such as workshops, seminars and courses in peace work and [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://peace.no/NO/norsk-hvem-vi-er/norsk-nansen-fredssenter/nar/norsk-senterets-historie/|title=Senterets historie|newspaper=Peace|language=no-NB|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petra Airlines''' was an airline based in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]]. The company was founded in 2005 as a subsidiary of '''RUM Group''' (which also owned now defunct [[Air Rum]]), but acquired its first airplane only in October 2010.&lt;ref name="LW" /&gt; The name of the company was derived from the [[Rock cut architecture|rock cut]] city of [[Petra]], one of the most famous tourist sights in Jordan.

In early 2011, Petra Airlines began providing charter services to tour operators. In 2012, it upgraded its license to become a scheduled airline.

In January 2015, [[Air Arabia]] announced the acquisition of a 49% stake in Petra Airlines. The RUM Group retained a 51% stake in the airline, which was then rebranded as [[Air Arabia Jordan]] in early 2015. As such, it initially operates 2 Airbus A320 aircraft and there are plans to develop a new hub in Amman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Air Arabia Expands into Jordan|journal=Airliner World|date=March 2015|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Pirate radio}}

==Vietnam==
[[Radio First Termer]] was a pirate radio station which operated in January 1971 in [[Saigon]] during the [[Vietnam War]].

The station was hosted by a [[United States Air Force]] sergeant&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/09/23/rabbit/?source=whitelist Good morning, Baghdad!- Salon News]&lt;/ref&gt; (born August 15, 1948&lt;ref name="vietnamresearch"&gt;[http://vietnamresearch.com/media/termer/feb2006.html Vietnam War Pirate DJ Dave Rabbit Has Finally Come Forward]&lt;/ref&gt;) calling himself "Dave Rabbit".&lt;ref name="vietnamresearch"/&gt; The two other members of the crew were known as "Pete Sadler" and "Nguyen". Their real names were Don Wade and Roma, a WLS team.

After three tours in Vietnam, "Dave Rabbit" and his friends launched Radio First Termer from a secret studio in a Saigon [[brothel]]. The station broadcast for 63 hours&lt;ref name="vietnamresearch"/&gt; over 21 nights (between 1 January 1971 and 21 January 1971&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;[http://www.radiofirsttermer.com.vn/ The Radio First Termer Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The station played "hard acid rock" such as [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Bloodrock]], [[Three Dog Night]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Sugarloaf (band)|Sugarloaf]], the [[James Gang]], and [[Iron Butterfly]], bands which were popular among the troops but largely ignored by the [[American Forces Vietnam Network]].  The music was mixed with [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|antiwar]] commentary, skits poking fun at the U.S. Air Force and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and raunchy [[sexual intercourse|sex]] and [[drug subculture|drug]] oriented jokes.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;

During the mid-1990s, sound clips from a Radio First Termer broadcast posted on the internet renewed interest in the station.  In February 2006, "Dave Rabbit" came forward and told his story.  He also did an interview for a bonus feature on the DVD release of ''[[Sir! No Sir!]]'', a film about G.I. counterculture during the Vietnam era.

Although the frequency was always announced as FM69, in reality the show was broadcast over numerous frequencies, in addition to 69&amp;nbsp;MHz as selected by the Radio Relay troops across Vietnam. It was also broadcast over AM frequencies, including 690 AM.

In February 2008 audio clips of this underground radio show made their way into the hands [[Opie &amp; Anthony]] and 3rd mic [[Jim Norton (American comedian)|Jim Norton]]. They played some of the audio of these shows over the air at both their terrestrial radio show and their XM Satellite radio show and were impressed with the skills of Dave Rabbit back in "the 'Nam" which led to renewed interest on such sites as Google.

==China==
A number of offshore radio stations have reportedly operated from the [[South China Sea]], mainly for political purposes and these include Voice of the People's Liberation Army; Radio Flash; The October Storm; Redifussion Central; Popular of Peking. In 1990-1991, two other offshore radio stations intended for a Chinese audience made news in the world's press.

One of them was Radio Tiananmen, a station that was to be based aboard the MV ''Sarah'' (''Lichfield I'') to be renamed ''Liberty'' that had been the former home of [[Radio Newyork International]] that broadcast briefly during two consecutive years in late 1980s from an anchorage off [[Jones Beach Island|Jones Beach]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The idea was to anchor the ship in international waters off the Northeast coastline of the USA and to broadcast on behalf of the thousands of Chinese students studying in the USA in support of their fellow students who had demonstrated in [[Tiananmen Square]]. The idea faltered when the backers were told that the United States government would oppose an independent political station of this type.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The other station was created in France and sponsored by {{ill|Actuel (magazine)|lt=Actuel|fr|}}, a French magazine and [[The Face (magazine)|The Face]], a British magazine together with support from contributors in [[Hong Kong]]. The group called themselves "Federation for Democracy in China" and they bought a ship, which they renamed, ''Goddess of Democracy'', which was also the name of the proposed station. When the vessel sailed from [[La Rochelle]], [[France]] it was intended for the ship to dock and that is where studios, transmitters and radio antenna would be installed. However, the project was abandoned after political and financial problems.

==Hong Kong==
In 2006, [[Citizens' Radio]] was founded by a group of [[pro-democracy]] activists, including [[Tsang Kin-shing]] and legislator [[Leung Kwok-hung]], also known as "Long Hair". It broadcast on weeknights from Chai Wan on 102.8&amp;nbsp;MHz FM.

On 30 November 2009, [http://fm101kt.blogspot.com/ FM101], a station based in [[Kwun Tong]] commenced broadcasting, according to the [[South China Morning Post]] (1 December 2009). It was heard in the east of [[Kowloon]] and the east of [[Hong Kong Island]]. The station's founders include Leung King-wai, Tsang Chun-ying and Kwok Yiu-cheong. The latter two were formerly presenters for [[Citizens' Radio]], but Citizens' Radio was not involved in its foundation, according to founder Tsang Kin-shing.

==Taiwan==
In reference to unlicensed land-based stations, the term ''underground radio'' is in common usage in Taiwan.  The [[World United Formosans for Independence]] reportedly studied the possibility of broadcasting from the [[Philippines]], but no concrete action materialised.

The underground radio movement began in the liberalising political milieu following the lifting of the decades-long [[martial law]].  Historically most of the stations have opposed, in some manner, the political establishment represented by the Chinese Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) and the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) framework, in favour of the then opposition movement broadly consisting of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) and allied [[social movement]]s.  These so-called pan-green radio stations are mostly based in central and southern Taiwan with most listeners being hard-core pan-green supporters who despise Kuomintang rule and the potential for reunification with China. A few stations positioned themselves on the opposing end of the political spectrum, generally favouring the ROC status quo advocated by the [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]] and "non-mainstream factions" within the Nationalist Party. With the DPP formerly in power, and ultimate Taiwan independence and sovereignty being the stance taken by most underground radio stations, Taiwan was one of the rare examples in the world of underground radio stations being pro-government.

Programming generally is of a vertical blocking format, with live call-ins taking up a good portion of air time. On some stations slots are allocated to local community and activist groups.  The most prominent segment of the audience comes from rural [[working class]], males usually middle aged and beyond. [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] is by far the most commonly used language on the air, although [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] and, much less frequently, [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] are also used. Underground radio stations cover their expenses by selling unorthodox drugs or medicine in a humorous and entertaining manner to keep the listeners hooked between actual programming.{{Or|date=August 2009}}

Most if not all underground stations favour a mechanism to gain legal status but many balk at the costly requirements, which they believe to favour corporate and Nationalist-owned broadcasters. Government policy has always treated underground radio as an illegal enterprise, even after the DPP came to power. Official responses have been more varied, alternating between levying fines and confiscating equipment to tolerating their presence. Most stations are able to set up backup broadcast points within days of government raids.  Commercial stations are known to file official complaints against pirate stations, whose signals are said to interfere with legal broadcasts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Philippines==
Licensed radio operations in the country are supervised by the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission]] and the same (along with the [[Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas]]) has been involved in raids cracking down unlicensed stations. Despite the proliferation of pirate radio in various times and the agency's proper counteractions, the most documented notorious hub of unlicensed operators have been predominantly within [[Metro Manila]] while others are from [[Cebu]] and in some parts of [[Mindanao]].

===2006-2013: 107.9 U-Radio===
The most known unregulated radio station was '''[[107.9 U-Radio]]'''. It began its broadcast in 2006, succeeding [[DZWI|Power 108 FM]], that shut down on August 31, 2004 on claims that the former station was a pirate. The station started broadcasting in Metro Manila  at 107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz with the power of 100 watts, playing non-stop dance music, with no call sign and disc jockeys, and a stinger of a recorded female voiceover mentioning a mobile phone number that served as a request line in between queues. With hundreds of text messages being received daily, the station was a hot topic at dozens of blogs and forums over the internet.

In April 2007 they temporarily ceased transmission so they could obtain all the necessary broadcast permits from the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission]] to legitimize the station. In June 2007, U Radio returned on air under the temporary license of a community-based radio station and started broadcasting with the power of 500 watts.

Recently, on April 20, 2013, 107.9 U-Radio ceased its operation, due to the claims of the Professional Regulations Commission and the National Telecommunications Commission that it was a pirate station, and its expired license. However, it continues its broadcast online.

===2015-present: Post-107.9 U-Radio===
====98.3 Radyo Kontra Droga====
The Filipino hip-hop and rap formatted station was founded in late 2015 by two-way radio dealer and proprietor Ron Flores Cruz at a [[Paco, Manila]] studio in time for then-candidate for President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]'s campaign, initially as a limited-time nightly operation that later expanded to as much as 18 hours daily. At the onset of operations, the station's frequency was formerly occupied legitimately by the [[DZMC|Polytechnic University of the Philippines' campus radio]] until it went on hiatus on November 2008. Its 50-watt signal covers parts of the immediate Manila area. 

Listeners contended that the station was pirate due to the then-perceived absence of an immediate public concern over a massive crackdown on illegal drugs.

On July 2018, the Polytechnic University of the Philippines resumed test broadcasts on the same frequency with plans of resuming full-time services by September, forming a currently unresolved broadcasting conflict. Owing to the proximity of both Paco and [[Santa Mesa, Manila]] where the campus station is located, both have significantly interfered with each other.

====Radyo Kontra Weeaboo====
The multiplexed pirate network of stations are heavily [[J-pop]] formatted outlets claiming as "edgy radio stations" in the whole of Metro Manila. The whole venture that was started on May 31, 2017, playing J-pop, anime and tokusatsu soundtracks and a series of Morse codes reading "RKW", is reportedly ran by a group led by an [[amateur radio]] operator.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} 
The stations are respectively broadcasting on 107.1 FM as '''RKW-1 Southern Metro Manila''' and 89.5 FM as '''RKW-2 Northern Metro Manila''', housed in [[Pasay City]] and [[Quezon City]] while maintaining a main studio located in [[Cavite City]]. The outlet later started simulcasting online&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kontrawibu.caster.fm|title=Radyo Kontra Weeaboo|website=Caster.fm|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Prior to commencement of operations, the 89.5 FM spot was last legally operated as [[DLSU]]'s [[Green Giant FM]] until when the station migrated exclusively online. Since 2013, the frequency, however has a presence in southern Metro Manila through [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]]-based '''DWEG 89.5'''. The 107.1 spot had previously been a dormant position since 2010, lastly occupied by '''Z-107''' (DWYZ), a low-power hip-hop formatted station that ceased operations after failing to secure a renewed permit from the NTC.

Complaints over the stations have been levelled due to its expletive-riddled and copyright infringed station ID{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}  that is using an altered version of [[DZBB-AM|Super Radyo DZBB 594]]'s 2017 jingle. The stations have reportedly been illegally reusing callsigns{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}, the first being '''DZTT''' at 89.5 (pronounced D-Z-double-T, a parody of the DZBB-AM calls) and '''DWBU''' at 107.1. The latter calls, however [[DWBU|are legally held by the Bicol University campus radio]]. Furthermore, the stations have earned the ire of a non-profit group composed of broadcasters and radio enthusiasts.

So far, no documented actions by the National Telecommunications Commission against the stations have been released.

====Pathway Radio Cebu====
Another low-powered pirate station based in Cebu, '''Pathway Radio 100.7''', started its operation around January 2017. Pathway Radio is a religious station operated at a very low power of 100 watts. The station has been a member of '''Community Broadcasters Association of the Philippines''' (CBAP), an organization consists of other community broadcasters across the Philippines and has no affiliation to the KBP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pathwayfm.weebly.com/our-story.html History of Pathway Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mindanao====
In a report by ''[[Sun.Star]]'', there were 30 identified illegal radio stations that were allegedly operated within the [[Davao Region]], including one owned by a Congressman. The NTC-XI issued a cease and desist order for 26 stations while issued a show-cause order for 4.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Complete Guide to Heraldry Fig490.png|thumb|Seal of Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester: ''A cinquefoil pierced ermine'']]
'''Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester''' (died circa 21 October 1204) ([[List of Latinized names|Latinized]] to ''de Bellomonte'' ("from the beautiful mountain")) was an [[England|English]] nobleman, the last of the Beaumont earls of Leicester. He is sometimes known as '''[[Robert FitzPernel]]'''.

Robert was the eldest surviving son of [[Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester]] and [[Petronilla de Grandmesnil, Countess of Leicester|Petronilla de Grandmesnil]], who was either a granddaughter or great-granddaughter of [[Hugh de Grandmesnil]]. As a young man, he accompanied [[Richard I of England|King Richard I]] on the [[Third Crusade]], and it was while the crusading forces rested at [[Messina, Italy|Messina]], [[Sicily]] that Robert was invested with the [[Earl of Leicester|Earldom of Leicester]] in early 1191. (His father had died on his way to the Holy Lands in 1190.)

Robert's newly gained estates included a large part of central [[Normandy]]. He held castles at Pacy, Pont-Saint-Pierre and Grandmesnil. Earl Robert also was lord of the vast honor of Breteuil, but the family castle there had been dismantled after the [[1173-1174 War]]. On his return from the crusade, he turned his attentions to the defense of Normandy from the [[France|French]]. After defending [[Rouen]] from the advances of [[Philip II of France]], he attempted to retake his castle of Pacy. He was captured by forces of the French king and remained imprisoned for 3 years. Later, King John would bestow the new fortress and lordship of Radepont (the land of Radepont was traded to King John by the seigneur du Neubourg for lands and revenues in the pays de Caux) upon the earl.

Sometime after his release in 1196 he married [[Loretta de Braose]], daughter of [[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber]]. They had no children, and Robert's death in 1204 brought the end of the Beaumont male line.

In the year of his death Normandy was lost to the French; Earl Robert attempted to come to an independent arrangement with King Philip of France, in which he would hold his land in Normandy as a liege-vassal of the Kings of France, and his lands in England as a liege-vassal of the Kings of England. In any event, Robert died that year, but his great English estates were divided between the heirs of his two sisters. The eldest sister, Amicia, had married the French [[baron]] [[Simon III de Montfort|Simon de Montfort]], and their son, also named [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], inherited half the estate as well as the title of Earl of Leicester. The younger sister, Margaret, had married [[Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester|Saer de Quincy]], and they inherited the other half. Three years later Saer was created [[Earl of Winchester]].

'''Royal Wings''' ('''RW'''&lt;!--NOT an IATA code, NOT a ICAO code - just the company abbreviation--&gt;, {{lang-ar|الأجنحة الملكية}}) was a [[Royal Jordanian]] Group Company and the charter arm of Royal Jordanian, was an [[airline]] based in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]]. Its main base was at [[Queen Alia International Airport]] (AMM), Amman with a hubs also at [[Amman Civil Airport]] (ADJ) and [[King Hussein International Airport]] (AQJ).

[[File:Royal Wings Airbus A320 Nussbaumer.jpg|thumbnail|A Royal Wings Airbus A320]]

==History==
The scheduled service strategy of Royal Wings was initiated to develop a domestic and regional carrier for Jordan which could adequately serve the needs of domestic travel, national and regional tours. During the introduction of Royal Wings, the fleet consisted  of two [[Bombardier DHC-8]] which operated scheduled flights from [[Amman Civil Airport]] in Marka to [[Aqaba]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Arish]], [[Ankara]], [[Aleppo]], [[Sharm el-Sheikh]] and [[Alexandria]], in addition to charter services to a number of destinations namely, [[Larnaca]], [[Rhodes]], [[Antalya]], [[Dalaman]], [[Bodrum]], [[Hurghada]], Sharm el-Sheikh, Alexandria, [[Luxor]] and [[Aswan]], mainly during the summer holiday season (June to October) and on occasions of festivals like Eids, Easter, Christmas and New Year.
During 2005, Royal Wings went through restructuring and transformation to adjust to the aviation environment in the region. Royal Wings has now moved into a new and exciting phase to meet the growth and needs of the global aviation industry by positioning itself as an international low cost chartered carrier operating out of Jordan. Royal Wings has acquired a new and modern fleet and transformed itself on the ground and in the air to meet the highest international standards of safety, reliability and service.

In addition to air transport, Royal Wings provides handling and maintenance services to other aircraft. In 1979, the [[Fixed-base operator (aviation)|Fixed-base operator]] (FBO) was established at Amman Civil Airport by providing VIP handling to all general aviation aircraft as well as for commercial flights.

Royal Wings objectives and goals are to maintain service and operate short-to-medium range modern aircraft safely and efficiently to potential domestic, regional and international airports, provide an affordable, convenient and efficient service with convenient timings and comfortable travel.

On November 13 2018, the parent company of the airline [[Royal Jordanian]], announced that all Royal Wings operations would end on November 30, 2018 due to subsequent losses and high operating costs. It was also announced that the sole Royal Wings operated aircraft would be transferred back to [[Royal Jordanian]] rejoining the mainline fleet. In addition, 12 seconded employees returned back to RJ and 18 new employees who previously were employed by Royal Wings also made the transfer to the parent company at the end of the month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jordantimes.com/news/business/rj-stop-royal-wings-operations-offers-solutions-employees&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Marie''' is a fictional island in the [[Lesser Antilles]] which serves as the setting for the [[BBC]] crime drama television series ''[[Death in Paradise (TV series)|Death in Paradise]]''.

==Premise==
Saint Marie is described in Episode 3.3 as a "pretty island" that is "situated in the Eastern [[Caribbean Sea]]" and "one-tenth the size of its north-west neighbour Guadeloupe", which would make Saint Marie about {{convert|63|mi2|km2}} in size. It is described in Episode 4.5 as being 70 miles from [[Martinique]].

The island is a [[British Overseas Territory]], but was handed over to the British from the French only in the 1970s, so that about 30% of its people are French citizens, with the French language still widely spoken.

The back-story appears to be a blend of two real-world islands near to Guadeloupe, with size and location aligning with [[Marie-Galante]] (in real-life politically affiliated with Guadeloupe, not independent of it), and history and language aligning with [[Dominica]]. Another possible basis is Îlet Sainte Marie{{Original research inline|date=November 2016}} "The [[:fr:Îlet Sainte-Marie|Îlet Sainte-Marie]] is an island located on the northeast coast of Martinique, right in front of the small town of Sainte-Marie, known in the North Atlantic region. Very popular with tourists, it is a geological curiosity of nature, as connected to the rest of the island by a [[tombolo]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title='''Le Guide du Routard - Martinique'''|last=Équipe du Guide du Routard|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Hachette Tourisme|isbn=9782012453982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Episode 5.2 a map can be seen with Puerto Rico in the northwest and [[Dominica]] in the southeast of the map, Saint Marie, in addition to another fictional island, Saint Robert, are present on the map, it would appear that there is significantly more distance between Guadelope and Dominica in the [[Death in Paradise (TV series)|Death in Paradise]] [[Fictional universe|universe]], Saint Robert appears similar in shape, and slightly smaller in size than, Dominica, although rotated by about 100-110 degrees anti-clockwise; although inconsistent with other in-universe statements Saint Marie appears about the same size as Dominica, and much larger than [[Marie-Galante]]. Marie-Galante, Saint-Marie, Spinner's Rock (a small islet relevant to this episode), and Saint Robert can be described as being on a straight line between Guadelope and Dominica in that order from the most northern to the most southern. Both Marie-Galante and Dominica are present, thus ruling out the possibilities of these two as candidates for Saint-Marie.

They drive on the same side of the road as the UK,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08cbpkc&lt;/ref&gt; but vehicles, including the police Land Rover Defender 110, have number plates the same format as the [[vehicle registration plates of France]].

==Features==

Saint Marie's population is assumed to be around 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graff|first1=Vincent|title=Death in Paradise: Ben Miller on investigating the deadliest place on the planet|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-01-08/death-in-paradise-ben-miller-on-investigating-the-deadliest-place-on-the-planet|accessdate=18 September 2015|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series, Saint Marie has a [[volcano]], [[rainforest]], [[sugar plantation]]s, a [[harbour|fishing harbour]], an [[airport]], a [[university]], a [[convent]], multiple [[hotel]]s, approximately 100 public [[beaches]], and a [[Crown Court]]. It also has its own [[newspaper]], ''The Saint Marie Times.'' Honoré, the main town, has a leisure/commercial [[marina]], [[market (place)|market]], [[bar|bars]], and [[restaurants]] as well as the [[police station]]. The neighbouring town to Honoré is named as Port Royal. Its main economic ties are to [[Guadeloupe]], the [[UK]], and [[France]], but it uses the [[East Caribbean Dollar]] as its unit of currency, as opposed to the [[Pound Sterling|Pound]] or the [[Euro]]. The island's main religions are [[Catholicism]] and [[Voodoo (disambiguation)|Voodoo]], with several religious festivals featuring in the programme, including the [[Saint Ursula]] Festival (in reality, a major festival of the [[Virgin Islands]]) and some Voodoo festivals.

The series is filmed on [[Guadeloupe]], and [[Deshaies]] doubles for the fictional town of Honoré.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death in Paradise: Guadeloupe, the real-life St Marie|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/articles/Death-in-Paradise-Guadeloupe-the-real-life-St-Marie/|work=The Telegraph|date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''STATPHYS''' is an international conference on [[statistical physics]] of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP).  The series of conferences take place every three years in a different continent to give the maximum international relevance and visibility to the event.  It is the world event for the broad field of statistical physics and all its interdisciplinary developments.  The first meeting was in Florence in 1948.  After a pioneering period the periodicity of three years was established and the conference has acquired more and more importance.  The participation has reached peaks up to 1500 participants in the recent years.  Also on the occasion of this conference the prestigious [[Boltzmann medal]] is awarded.  In addition several satellite meetings are usually held along with the main event, adding to the scientific value of the meeting.

The '''Taiwanese Cultural Association''' ('''TCA'''; {{zh|t=台灣文化協會|p=tai2wan1 wen2hua4 xie2hui4}}) was an important organization during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] of [[Taiwan]]. It was founded by [[Chiang Wei-shui]] on 17 October 1921, in [[Dadaocheng|Daitōtei]], a district in modern-day [[Taipei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Han Cheung|title=Taiwan in Time: Anti-colonial messages from the sky|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/10/16/2003657251|accessdate=16 October 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After [[World War I]], an epidemic of [[self-determination]] and [[democracy]] engulfed the world. Needless to say, Taiwan was also inundated with this new sense of [[independence]]. Inspired by the [[Samil Movement]] in [[Korea]] in 1919, Taiwanese college students in [[Japan]] further developed their craving for an independent Taiwan.

At that time, only affluent Taiwanese families could send their children to Japanese universities. Most of these children were born and raised during Japanese [[colonization]] of Taiwan. Therefore, they were taught using Japanese methods and customs quite different from the education of their parents, a formal Chinese education teaching strictly traditions and ancient philosophies. In [[Japan]], Taiwanese students underwent extreme racism from not only Japanese students but also their friends and relatives. When improperly treated by the Japanese (e.g. being called {{nihongo||清國奴|Chankoro|[[Qing]] slaves}}), these students would often search for methods of circumventing trouble. Due to these actions, though, they were often taunted by Korean students for not fighting for their own rights.

===Japan===
Japan was not only the hub of advanced learning for Taiwanese students, but also an excellent opportunity to learn revolutionary ideas such as [[social equality|equality]] for all people and [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], options that the oppressive Japanese Regime would not allow. This was where intellectuals adopted new and more innovated ideas in order to gain either [[independence]] or [[autonomy]] for Taiwan. These intellectuals often held conferences discussing beneficial possibilities. They petitioned the Japanese government to permit the enactment of a representative committee which spoke in favor of Taiwanese people, thus taking a vital step towards democracy. The committee, established in 1921, was called the [[Petition Movement for the Establishment of a Taiwanese Parliament]]. [[Lin Hsien-tang]] was elected as their headperson. During its fourteen-year span, many rallies were held.
