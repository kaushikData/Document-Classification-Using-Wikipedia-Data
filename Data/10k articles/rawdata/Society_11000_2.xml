== History ==
18th Street gang started near 18th Street and Union Avenue in the [[Rampart, Los Angeles, California|Rampart District]] of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Ribando"/&gt; There is conflicting information as to the exact area, but this is a generally accepted area by most academic sources. They were originally part of Clanton 14 but wanted to make a separate "clique" called Clanton 18th Street and allow immigrants the opportunity to join. This proposal was rejected by the Clanton 14, which led to the formation of the 18th Street gang. The two gangs have been bitter rivals ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Zilberg, E. (2011). Space of detention: The making of a transnational gang crisis between Los Angeles and San Salvador. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th Street gang grew by expanding its membership to other nationalities and races, and it was among the first multiracial, multi-ethnic gangs in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Ribando" /&gt; In the beginning, they were made up largely of second-generation Hispanics.&lt;ref name="Ribando" /&gt; As the 18th Street gang began to battle with more established Hispanic gangs, they began to recruit outside the Hispanic community. There are approximately 200 separate individual autonomous gangs operating under the same name within separate ''barrios'' in the [[San Fernando Valley]], the [[San Gabriel Valley]], [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]], [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]], [[South Los Angeles]], [[Downtown Los Angeles]], [[Pico-Union, Los Angeles, California|Pico Union]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], [[Lynwood, California|Lynwood]], [[South Gate, California|South Gate]], [[Huntington Park, California|Huntington Park]], [[Maywood, California|Maywood]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], and Los Angeles' [[Westside, Los Angeles|Westside]], according to the latest figures from the [[National Drug Intelligence Center|NDIC]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In the early 2000s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation initiated wide-scale raids against known and suspected gang members, netting hundreds of arrests across the country.

=== Central America=== 
Although it started as a Mexican gang, 18th Street quickly became mainly [[Central American]] as it started to recruit more members of other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/maras-in-guatemala-increasing-in-sophistication Maras in Guatemala Increasing in Sophistication] - published by Jeremy McDermott on 3 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2014/11/06/the-youth-are-theirs-el-salvadors-horrifying-culture-of-gang-rape/ |title= El Salvador's horrifying culture of gangs |publisher= By Associated Press |accessdate= 29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghrc-usa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/GangFactSheet.pdf |title=Gangs in Guatemala |publisher=By ghrc-usa.org |accessdate=29 December 2014 |author=Julie Suarez |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VGNBPtoL?url=http://www.ghrc-usa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/GangFactSheet.pdf |archivedate=1 January 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/world/americas/09iht-guatemala.4.11831371.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title= Guatemalan gang culture conquers the abused with abuse |publisher= Marc Lacey |accessdate= 29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Central American gang members were arrested in the United States, they were then deported back to Central America where the gang rose out-of-control on different levels of violence not just in [[El Salvador]], but in [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]] as well, becoming one of the most violent gangs in Central America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/barrio-18 |title=El Salvador organized crime |publisher=insightcrime.org |accessdate=29 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VGNIioRq?url=http://www.insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/barrio-18 |archivedate=1 January 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-22694989 |title= Honduran gangs Salvatrucha and 18th Street announce truce |publisher= insightcrime.org |accessdate= 29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/haber/135377/honduras-street-gangs-torture-children-to-death |title=Honduran Street gangs |publisher=worldbulletin.net |accessdate=29 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VGNBjUnO?url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/haber/135377/honduras-street-gangs-torture-children-to-death |archivedate=1 January 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/lifestyle/honduras-gangs/11228933/mara-salvatrucha-18th-street-gang.html Honduras gangs "You can recognise the gangs from their murders"] published By Rob Crilly on 14 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 18th Street later became a bitter rival of [[MS-13]] as both gangs wanted the top spot in Central America.

== Location ==
The majority of 18th Street cliques operate throughout Southern California, but are active in other states and internationally as well. Los Angeles members began migrating to other areas outside America and started to establish their own cliques. 18th Street cliques have been identified in 120 cities in 37 states and the [[District of Columbia]] in the United States, as well internationally in Spain, Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Lebanon, Peru, Philippines, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bruneau|first= Thomas|date= 1 December 2011 |title= Maras: Gang Violence and Security in Central America (Google eBook)|page= 37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9P7W7pBQaVkC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=18th+Street+gang+cliques+England&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7qXHGiiZsc&amp;sig=GzF82nmdumG_P8rdQ0_JOizWIfU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=npsUU6nfPMLs2gX1p4GYDA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=18th%20Street%20gang%20cliques%20England&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= University of Texas Press |isbn= 978-0-292-72928-5 |accessdate= 3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
18th Street gang members are required to abide by a strict set of rules.  Failure to obey the word of a gang leader, or to show proper respect to a fellow gang member, may result in an 18-second beating, or even execution for more serious offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pollack |first=Ricardo |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4201183.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; Gang life tempts Salvador teens |publisher=BBC News |date=January 24, 2005 |accessdate=August 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100812073125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4201183.stm| archivedate= 12 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FBI, some factions of the 18th Street gang have developed a high level of sophistication and organization. 18th Street gang members often identify themselves with the number 18 on their clothing and sporting clothing from sports teams such as the [[Duke Blue Devils]], [[Los Angeles Clippers]], [[Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]], [[Los Angeles Chargers]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Oakland Raiders]]. 18th Street will use the symbols XV3, XVIII, X8, 99 (9+9=18), and 3-dots in their graffiti and tattoos. 18th Street colors are blue and black; blue is to represent and to pay tribute to The Mexican Mafia, and black is to represent the original color for the gang. The 18th Street gang is occasionally referred to as the "Children's Army" because of its recruitment of elementary and middle-school aged youth. They also allow other races to join their ranks making the gang Multi-ethnic. In El Salvador it is common for members of the gang to be tattooed on the face with a large "18". In many cases the tattoo covers the entire face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2012/may/09/el-salvador-gangs-in-pictures |title=El Salvador gangs celebrate a day without murders - in pictures |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=22 August 2016 |first=Joanna |last=Ruck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We recognize them as one of the most violent street gangs and one of the most prolific in the United States," says Special agent George Rodriguez, who until his retirement oversaw investigations for the federal [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]]. Cars are stolen and homes are burglarized by the gang routinely. On average, someone in Los Angeles County is assaulted or robbed by 18th Streeters every day. The gang has left a bloody trail at a pace three times that of many of the city's most active gangs. 18th Street is a well established gang that is involved in all areas of street-crime. Some members have even become involved in producing fraudulent [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] identification cards and [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Several 18th Street gang members have reached a higher level of sophistication and organization in their illicit activities than other gangs. While their main source of income is street-level distribution of drugs, they also have been linked to murders, assaults, arson, copyright infringement, extortion, human trafficking, illegal immigration, kidnapping, prostitution, robbery, and weapons trafficking, as well as other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/ndic/pubs32/32146/appb.htm#start National Gang Intelligence Center – National Gang threat assessment 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214194554/http://www.justice.gov/ndic/pubs32/32146/appb.htm |date=14 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 18th Street Gang has also been implicated in the high-profile kidnapping and murder of the 16-year-old brother of internationally renowned Honduran football player [[Wilson Palacios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/171815-tottenhams-wilson-palacios-brother-murdered-by-kidnappers-in-honduras |title=Tottenham's Wilson Palacios' Brother Murdered By Kidnappers in Honduras |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=May 10, 2009 |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |author=Willie Gannon |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VcxW6DFR?url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/171815-tottenhams-wilson-palacios-brother-murdered-by-kidnappers-in-honduras |archivedate=16 January 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al Jolson''' (born '''Asa Yoelson'''; May 26, 1886 – October 23, 1950) was an American singer, comedian, and stage and film actor. At the peak of his career, he was dubbed "The World's Greatest Entertainer". His performing style was brash and extroverted, and he popularized many songs that benefited from his "shamelessly sentimental, melodramatic approach."&lt;ref name="Ruhlmann"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ruhlmann |first1=William |title=Al Jolson |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/al-jolson-mn0000609215/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1920s, Jolson was America's most famous and highest-paid entertainer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Beryl Bainbridge|Bainbridge, Beryl]]. ''Front Row: Evenings at the Theatre'', Continuum International Publishing (2005), p. 109.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1911 and 1928, Jolson had nine sell-out [[Winter Garden Theatre|Winter Garden]] shows in a row, more than 80 hit records, and 16 national and international tours.{{Citation needed|reason=No citation provided provided|date=October 2018}}

Although best remembered today as the star of the first talking picture, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), he starred in a series of successful musical films during the 1930s. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], he was the first star to entertain troops overseas during [[World War II]]. After a period of inactivity, his stardom returned with ''[[The Jolson Story]]'' (1946), for which [[Larry Parks]] played Jolson, with the singer dubbing for Parks. The formula was repeated in a sequel, ''[[Jolson Sings Again]]'' (1949). In 1950, he again became the first star to entertain [[G.I. (military)|GIs]] on active service in the [[Korean War]], performing 42&amp;nbsp;shows in 16&amp;nbsp;days. He died weeks after returning to the U.S., partly owing to the physical exertion of performing. Defense Secretary [[George Marshall]] posthumously awarded him the [[Legion of Merit|Medal of Merit]].&lt;ref name=medal&gt;[http://www.marshallfilms.org/filminfo.asp?id=50.12.06&amp;enlarge=True ''Al Jolson Remembered''], Paramount News, Dec. 6, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture'', "Jolson was to jazz, blues, and ragtime what Elvis Presley was to rock 'n' roll." {{Citation needed|reason=No citation provided provided|date=October 2018}}Being the first popular singer to make a spectacular event out of singing a song, he became a rock star before the dawn of rock music. His specialty was performing on stage runways extending out into the audience.{{Citation needed|reason=No citation provided provided|date=October 2018}} He would run up and down the runway, and across the stage, "teasing, cajoling, and thrilling the audience", often stopping to sing to individual members; all the while the "perspiration would be pouring from his face, and the entire audience would get caught up in the ecstasy of his performance".{{Citation needed|reason=No citation provided provided|date=October 2018}} According to music historian Larry Stempel, "No one had heard anything quite like it before on Broadway." Author Stephen Banfield wrote that Jolson's style was "arguably the single most important factor in defining the modern musical".&lt;ref name=Showtime&gt;Stempel, Larry.

Jolson has been called "the king of [[blackface]]" performers,&lt;ref name="latimes2000"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moss |first1=Robert F. |title=Was Al Jolson 'Bamboozled'? |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/20/entertainment/ca-39153 |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=22 September 2018 |date=20 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Critical&gt;Rogin, Michael.

==Early life==
[[File:Jolson 1916.jpg|thumb|upright|Al Jolson, circa 1916]]
Al Jolson was born as '''Asa Yoelson''' ({{lang-yi|אַסאַ יואלסאָן}}) in the [[shtetl|Jewish village]] of [[Seredžius|Srednike]] ({{lang-yi| סרעדניק}}) now known as Seredžius, near [[Kaunas]] in [[Lithuania]], part of the [[Russian Empire]]. He was the fifth and youngest child of Moses Rubin Yoelson (c. 1858 – December 23, 1945) and Nechama "Naomi" Cantor (c. 1858 – February 6, 1895); his four siblings were Rose (c. 1879-1939), Etta (c. 1880-1948), another sister who died in infancy, and Hirsch (Harry) (c. 1882-1953). Jolson did not know his date of birth, as birth records were not kept at that time in that region, and he gave his birth year as 1885.&lt;ref&gt;The 1885 dates were given in a 1914 passenger list while traveling with his then wife Henrietta, where his first name is given as Alexander and in the 1925 New York state census and later as 1886. Freedland, Michael. ''Al Jolson'' (1972), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, his father, who was qualified as a [[rabbi]] and [[Hazzan|cantor]], moved to New York City to secure a better future for his family. By 1894, Moses Yoelson could afford to pay the fare to bring Nechama and their four children to the U.S. By the time they arrived—as steerage passengers on the S/S ''Umbria'' arriving at the Port of New York on April 9, 1894—he had found work as a cantor at [[National Synagogue|Talmud Torah Congregation]] in the [[Southwest Waterfront, Washington, D.C.|Southwest Waterfront]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C., where the family was reunited.&lt;ref&gt;Freedland, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hard times hit the family when his mother, Naomi, died at 37 in early 1895. Following his mother's death, young Asa was in a state of withdrawal for seven months. For a period of time, young Asa spent time at the [[Cardinal Gibbons School|St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys]], a progressive reformatory/home for orphans run by the [[Xaverian Brothers]] in Baltimore (the same school which would later be attended by [[Babe Ruth]]). Upon being introduced to show business in 1895 by entertainer [[Al Reeves]], Asa and Hirsch became fascinated by the industry, and by 1897 the brothers were singing for coins on local street corners, using the names "Al" and "Harry". They would usually use the money to buy tickets to shows at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theater]].&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Al Jolson {{!}} The Stars {{!}} Broadway: The American Musical |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/al-jolson/ |website=pbs.org |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asa and Hirsch spent most of their days working different jobs as a team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oberfirst|first=Robert|title=Al Jolson: You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet|year=1980|publisher=Barnes &amp; Co|location=London|pp=23–40|isbn=|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage performer==

===Burlesque and vaudeville===
In the spring of 1902, he accepted a job with Walter L. Main's Circus. Although Main had hired Jolson as an usher, Main was impressed by Jolson's singing voice and gave him a position as a singer during the circus' Indian Medicine Side Show segment.{{sfn |Oberfirst |1980 |pp=49–50}} By the end of the year, the circus had folded and Jolson was again out of work. In May 1903, the head producer of the [[American burlesque|burlesque]] show ''Dainty Duchess Burlesquers'' agreed to give Jolson a part in one show. Asa gave a remarkable performance of "Be My Baby Bumble Bee" and the producer agreed to keep him for future shows. Unfortunately, the show closed by the end of the year. Asa was able to avoid financial troubles by forming a [[vaudeville]] partnership with his brother Hirsch, now a vaudeville performer known as '''Harry Yoelson'''. The brothers worked for the [[William Morris Agency]].{{sfn |Oberfirst |1980 |pp=50–60}}

Asa and Harry soon formed a team with Joe Palmer. During their time with Palmer, they were able to gain bookings in a nationwide tour. However, live performances were falling in popularity as [[nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeons]] captured audiences; by 1908, nickelodeon theaters were dominant throughout New York City as well. While performing in a [[Brooklyn]] theater in 1904,&lt;ref name=JolyM&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/jolsonbio.htm "Al Jolson: A Biography"] (2003), Musicals101.com; accessed October 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Al decided on a new approach and began performing in [[blackface]], which boosted his career. He began wearing blackface in all of his shows.{{sfn |Oberfirst|1980|pp=61–80}}

In late 1905, Harry left the trio following an argument with Al. Harry had refused Al's request to take care of Joe Palmer, who was in a wheelchair, while he was dating. After Harry's departure, Al and Joe Palmer worked as a duo but were not particularly successful. By 1906&lt;ref name=JolyM /&gt; the two agreed to separate, and Jolson was on his own.{{sfn|Oberfirst|1980|pp=68–70}} Jolson became a regular at the Globe and Wigwam Theater in San Francisco, California, and remained successful nationwide as a vaudeville singer.&lt;ref name=JolyM /&gt; He took up residence in San Francisco, saying the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake]]-devastated people needed someone to cheer them up. In 1908 Jolson, needing money for himself and his new wife, Henrietta, returned to New York. In 1909, Al's singing caught the attention of [[Lew Dockstader]], the producer and star of Dockstader's Minstrels. Al accepted Dockstader's offer and became a regular blackface performer.{{sfn|Oberfirst|1980|pp=70–81}}

===Broadway playhouses===

====Winter Garden Theater====
According to ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, "[[Jacob J. Shubert|J.J. Shubert]], impressed by Jolson's overpowering display of energy, booked him for ''[[La Belle Paree]]'', a musical comedy that opened at the [[Winter Garden Theatre|Winter Garden]] in 1911. Within a month Jolson was a star. From then until 1926, when he retired from the stage, he could boast an unbroken series of smash hits."&lt;ref name="Digest"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zolotow |first1=Maurice |title=Reader's Digest, 1949 |url=https://jolsonville.net/articles/readers-digest-1949/ |website=jolsonville.net |accessdate=22 September 2018 |date=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 1911, Jolson starred in his first musical [[revue]] at the Winter Garden Theater in New York City, ''La Belle Paree'', greatly helping to launch his career as a singer. The opening night drew a huge crowd to the theater, and that evening Jolson gained audience popularity by singing old [[Stephen Foster]] songs in blackface. In the wake of that opening night, Jolson was given a position in the show's cast. The show closed after 104 performances, and during its run Jolson's popularity grew greatly. Following ''La Belle Paree'', he accepted an offer to perform in the musical ''[[Vera Violetta]]''. The show opened on November&amp;nbsp;20, 1911 and, like ''La Belle Paree'', was a phenomenal success. In the show, Jolson again sang in blackface and managed to become so popular that his weekly salary of $500 (based on his success in ''La Belle Paree'') was increased to $750.{{sfn|Oberfirst|1980|pp=98–117}}

After ''Vera Violetta'' ran its course, Jolson starred in another musical, ''The Whirl of Society'', propelling his career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] to new heights. During his time at the Winter Garden, Jolson would tell the audience, "You ain't heard nothing yet" before performing additional songs. In the play, Jolson debuted his signature blackface character, "Gus."&lt;ref name=JolyM /&gt; The play was so successful that Winter Garden owner [[Lee Shubert]] agreed to sign Jolson to a seven-year contract with a salary of $1,000 a week. Jolson would reprise his role as "Gus" in future plays and by 1914 achieved so much popularity with the theater audience that his $1,000-a-week salary was doubled to $2,000 a week. In 1916, ''[[Robinson Crusoe, Jr.]]'' was the first musical in which he was featured as the star character. In 1918, Jolson's acting career would be pushed even further after he starred in the hit musical ''[[Sinbad (musical)|Sinbad]]''.{{sfn|Oberfirst|1980|pp=123–141}}

It became the most successful Broadway musical of 1918 and 1919. A new song was later added to the show that would become composer [[George Gershwin]]'s first hit recording—"[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]". Jolson also added another song, "[[My Mammy]]," to the show. By 1920, Jolson had become the biggest star on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;Oberfirst, pp. 143–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jolson's own theater====
His next play, ''[[Bombo (musical)|Bombo]]'', would also take his career to new heights and became so successful that it went beyond Broadway and held performances nationwide.{{sfn |Oberfirst |1980 |p=171}} It also led Lee Shubert to rename his newly built theater, which was across from [[Central Park]], as [[New Century Theatre|'''Jolson's 59th Street Theatre''']]. Aged 35, Jolson became the youngest man in American history to have a theatre named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Herbert G., ''Jolson -– the Legend Comes to Life'' (1988), Oxford University Press, p. 117.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

But on the opening night of ''Bombo'', and the first performance at the new theatre, he suffered from extreme stage fright, walking up and down the streets for hours before showtime. Out of fear, he lost his voice backstage and begged the stagehands not to raise the curtains. But when the curtains went up, he "was [still] standing in the wings trembling and sweating." After being physically shoved onto the stage by his brother Harry, he performed and received an ovation that he would never forget: "For several minutes, the applause continued while Al stood and bowed after the first act." He refused to go back on stage for the second act, but the audience "just stamped its feet and chanted 'Jolson, Jolson', until he came back out." He took 37 curtain calls that night and told the audience, "I'm a happy man tonight."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1922, he moved the production to the larger Century Theater for a special benefit performance to aid injured [[Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America|Jewish veterans]] of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1922/03/10/archives/benefit-performances-bombo-to-be-given-at-century-in-aid-of-jewish.html "Benefit Performance: 'Bombo' to Be Given at Century in Aid of Jewish War Sufferers"] ''The New York Times'', March 10, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; After taking the show on the road for a season, he returned in May 1923, to perform ''Bombo'' at his "first love," the Winter Garden. The reviewer for ''The New York Times'' wrote, "He returned like the circus, bigger and brighter and newer than ever. … Last night's audience was flatteringly unwilling to go home, and when the show proper was over, Jolson reappeared before the curtain and sang more songs, old and new."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1923/05/15/archives/al-jolson-welcomed-back-he-returns-to-the-winter-garden-in-bombo.html "AL JOLSON WELCOMED BACK.; He Returns to the Winter Garden in "Bombo", With New Jokes"], ''The New York Times'', May 15, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

"I don't mind going on record as saying that he is one of the few instinctively funny men on our stage," wrote reviewer Charles Darnton in the ''[[New York World|New York Evening World]]''. "Everything he touches turns to fun. To watch him is to marvel at his humorous vitality. He is the old-time [[minstrel]] man turned to modern account. With a song, a word, or even a suggestion he calls forth spontaneous laughter. And here you have the definition of a born comedian."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing in blackface==
[[File:Jolson black.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', 1927]]

Jolson often performed in blackface makeup.&lt;ref name="dies"&gt;{{cite web |title=Al Jolson Dies: Oct. 23, 1950 |url=https://jolsonville.net/2012/10/18/jolson-dead-new-york-times-1950/ |website=jolsonville.net |accessdate=22 September 2018 |date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performing in [[blackface]] makeup was a theatrical convention of many entertainers at the beginning of the 20th century, having its origin in the [[minstrel show]].&lt;ref name="rowland"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rowland-Warne |first1=L. |title=Costume |date=2000 |publisher=Knopf (DK) |isbn=0-7894-5586-2 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to film historian [[Eric Lott]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"For the white minstrel man to put on the cultural forms of 'blackness' was to engage in a complex affair of manly mimicry.... To wear or even enjoy blackface was literally, for a time, to become black, to inherit the cool, virility, humility, abandon, or ''gaité de coeur'' that were the prime components of white ideologies of black manhood."&lt;ref name="Lott"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lott|first=Eric|title=Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Lg5mDUSgYsC&amp;pg=PA52|date=28 October 1993|publisher=Oxford University Press, US|isbn=978-0-19-976224-8|pages=52–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the retrospective view of a later era, however, the use of blackface has come to be viewed as implicit racism.&lt;ref name=ferris1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pickering"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pickering |first1=Michael |title=Blackface Minstrelsy in Britain |date=2008 |publisher=Ashgate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Brian |title=Blackface Nation: Race, Reform, and Identity in American Popular Music, 1812–1925|date=2017 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=9780226451503 |pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music critic Ted Gioia, commenting on Jolson's use of blackface, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Blackface evokes memories of the most unpleasant side of racial relations, and of an age in which white entertainers used the makeup to ridicule black Americans while brazenly borrowing from the rich black musical traditions that were rarely allowed direct expression in mainstream society. This is heavy baggage for Al Jolson.&lt;ref name="ferris1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gioia |first1=Ted |title=Al Jolson: A Megastar Long Buried Under a Layer of Blackface - Jim Crow Museum - Ferris State University |url=https://ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/links/essays/jolson.htm |website=ferris.edu |accessdate=22 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===As metaphor of mutual suffering===
Historians have described Jolson's blackface and singing style as metaphors for Jewish and black suffering throughout history. Jolson's first film, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', for instance, is described by historian [[Michael Alexander (academic)|Michael Alexander]] as an expression of the [[liturgy|liturgical]] music of Jews with the "imagined music of African Americans," noting that "prayer and jazz become metaphors for Jews and blacks." &lt;ref name="Alexander, Michael 2003 p. 176"&gt;Alexander, Michael. ''Jazz Age Jews'', Princeton University Press (2003), p. 176.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Playwright [[Samson Raphaelson]], after seeing Jolson perform his stage show ''Robinson Crusoe'', stated that "he had an epiphany: 'My God, this isn't a jazz singer', he said. 'This is a [[Hazzan|cantor]]!'" The image of the blackfaced cantor remained in Raphaelson's mind when he conceived of the story which led to ''The Jazz Singer''.&lt;ref name=Norwood&gt;Norwood, Stephen Harlan, and Pollack, Eunice G. ''Encyclopedia of American Jewish History'', ABC-CLIO, Inc. (2008), p. 502.&lt;!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the film's release, the first full-length sound picture, film reviewers saw the symbolism and metaphors portrayed by Jolson in his role as the son of a cantor wanting to become a "jazz singer":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not. Indeed, I detected again and again the minor key of Jewish music, the wail of the [[Chazan]], the cry of anguish of a people who had suffered. The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world's history.&lt;ref name=Norwood/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Alexander, Eastern European Jews were uniquely qualified to understand the music, noting how Jolson himself made the comparison of Jewish and African-American suffering in a new land in his film ''Big Boy'': In a blackface portrayal of a former slave, he leads a group of recently freed slaves, played by black actors, in verses of the classic slave spiritual "[[Go Down Moses]]". One reviewer of the film expressed how Jolson's blackface added significance to his role:&lt;blockquote&gt;When one hears Jolson's jazz songs, one realizes that jazz is the new prayer of the American masses, and Al Jolson is their cantor. The Negro makeup in which he expresses his misery is the appropriate [[tallit|talis]] [prayer shawl] for such a communal leader.&lt;ref name="Alexander, Michael 2003 p. 176"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many in the black community welcomed ''The Jazz Singer'' and saw it as a vehicle to gain access to the stage. Audiences at Harlem's Lafayette Theater cried during the film, and Harlem's newspaper, ''Amsterdam News'', called it "one of the greatest pictures ever produced." For Jolson, it wrote: "Every colored performer is proud of him."&lt;ref&gt;Rogin, Michael. ''Blackface, White Noise: Jewish Immigrants in the Hollywood Melting Pot'', University of California Press (1996), p. 197.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with African Americans===
{{See also|African-American – Jewish relations}}
Jolson's legacy as the most popular performer of blackface routines was complemented by his relationships with African-Americans and his appreciation and use of African-American cultural trends.&lt;ref name="ferris1" /&gt; Jolson first heard [[jazz]], [[blues]], and [[ragtime]] in the alleys of New Orleans, Louisiana. He enjoyed singing the ''new'' jazz-style of music, often performing in blackface, especially in the songs he made popular, such as "[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]", "[[My Mammy]]", and "[[Rock-A-Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody]]".

As a Jewish immigrant and America's most famous and highest-paid entertainer, he may have had the incentive and resources to help break down racial attitudes. While ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' glorified white supremacy and the KKK, Jolson chose to star in ''The Jazz Singer'', which defied racial bigotry by introducing American black music to audiences worldwide.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;

While growing up, Jolson had many black friends, including [[Bill Robinson|Bill "Bojangles" Robinson]], who became a prominent [[tap dancer]].&lt;ref name=Digest/&gt; As early as 1911, at the age of 25, Jolson was noted for fighting discrimination on Broadway and later in his movies:&lt;ref name=blackstar/&gt;

Al Jolson once read in the newspaper that songwriters [[Eubie Blake]] and [[Noble Sissle]], neither of whom he had ever heard of, were refused service at a [[Connecticut]] restaurant because of their race. He immediately tracked them down and took them out to dinner, "insisting he'd punch anyone in the nose who tried to kick us out!"&lt;ref name="ferris1" /&gt; According to biographer Al Rose, Jolson and Blake became friends.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This didn't have anything to do with the theater, because they never worked together. Rather, they both had a love of prize fighting and used to go to boxing matches together, engaging in jocose discussion of the relative merits of Negro with Jewish pugilists. They would occasionally wager a bottle of whisky on these bouts.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Al. ''Eubie Blake'', Macmillan (1979), pp. 67–68.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Film historian [[Charles Musser]] notes that "African Americans' embrace of Jolson was not a spontaneous reaction to his appearance in talking pictures. In an era when African Americans did not have to go looking for enemies, Jolson was perceived a friend."&lt;ref&gt;Musser, Charles.

You didn't associate too much socially with any of the stars. You saw them at the studio, you know, nice—but they didn't invite.

British performer [[Brian Conley]], former star of the 1995 British play ''[[Jolson]]'', stated during an interview, "I found out Jolson was actually a hero to the black people of America. At his funeral, black actors lined the way, they really appreciated what he'd done for them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=207&amp;story=E8821214221855&amp;title=Past%2FPresent%2FFuture+for+%85+Brian+Conley "Past/Present/Future for&amp;nbsp;… Brian Conley"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''What's on Stage'', June 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jolson's physical expressiveness also affected the music styles of some black performers. Music historian Bob Gulla writes that "the most critical influence in [[Jackie Wilson]]'s young life was Al Jolson." He points out that Wilson's ideas of what a stage performer could do to keep their act an "exciting" and "thrilling performance" was shaped by Jolson's acts, "full of wild writhing and excessive theatrics". Wilson felt that Jolson "should be considered the stylistic [forefather] of rock and roll."&lt;ref name=Gulla&gt;Gulla, Bob.

According to the ''St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture'': "Almost single-handedly, Jolson helped to introduce African-American musical innovations like jazz, ragtime, and the blues to white audiences....

===''The Jazz Singer''===
{{Main|The Jazz Singer}}
[[File:The Jazz Singer 1927 Poster.jpg|thumb|Movie poster, 1927]]

Before ''The Jazz Singer'', Jolson starred in the talking film ''[[A Plantation Act]]''. This simulation of a stage performance by Jolson was presented in a program of musical shorts, demonstrating the [[Vitaphone]] sound-film process. The soundtrack for ''A Plantation Act'' was considered lost in 1933 but was found in 1995 and restored by [[Vitaphone#The Vitaphone Project|The Vitaphone Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eyman|first=Scott|title=The Speed of Sound: Hollywood and the Talkie Revolution, 1926–1930|year=1997|isbn=0-684-81162-6|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was included in Warner's 80th Anniversary release of ''The Jazz Singer'' on DVD.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Warner Bros. picked [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] for the role, as he had starred in the Broadway play. When [[Sam Warner]] decided to make ''The Jazz Singer'' a musical with the Vitaphone, he knew that Jolson was the star he needed. He told Jessel that he would have to sing in the movie, and Jessel balked, allowing Warner to replace him with Jolson. Jessel never got over it and often said that Warner gave the role to Jolson because he agreed to help finance the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|_fAjkJWyBnM|Interview with George Jessel, circa 1980}}, video – 2 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The movie premiere====
[[Harry Warner]]'s daughter, Doris, remembered the opening night, and said that when the picture started she was still crying over the loss of her beloved uncle Sam. He was planning to be at the performance but died suddenly at the age of 40, the day before. But halfway through the 89-minute movie she began to be overtaken by a sense that something remarkable was happening. Jolson's "Wait a minute" line provoked shouts of pleasure and applause from the audience, who were dumbfounded by seeing, hearing, someone speak on a film for the first time. So much so that the double-entendre was missed at first. After each Jolson song, the audience applauded. Excitement mounted as the film progressed, and when Jolson began his scene with [[Eugenie Besserer]], "the audience became hysterical."&lt;ref name=Eyman&gt;Eyman, Scott. ''The Speed of Sound: Hollywood and the Talkie Revolution, 1926&amp;nbsp;– 1930'', Simon and Schuster (1997), p. 129.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to film historian [[Scott Eyman]], "by the film's end, the Warner brothers had shown an audience something they had never known, moved them in a way they hadn't expected. The tumultuous ovation at curtain proved that Jolson was not merely the right man for the part of Jackie Rabinowitz, alias Jack Robin; he was the right man for the entire transition from silent fantasy to talking realism. The audience, transformed into what one critic called, 'a milling, battling mob' stood, stamped, and cheered 'Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!'"&lt;ref&gt;Eyman, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the film, Jolson rose from his seat and ran down to the stage. "God, I think you're really on the level about it. I feel good" he cried to the audience. Stanley Watkins would always remember Jolson signing autographs after the show, tears streaming down his face. [[May McAvoy]], Jolson's costar remembered that "[the] police were there to control the crowds. It was a very big thing, like ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''."{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

====Introduction of sound====
The film was produced by Warner Bros., using its new [[Vitaphone]] sound process.{{Citation needed|reason=No citation provided provided|date=November 2018}} Vitaphone was originally intended for musical renditions, and ''The Jazz Singer'' follows this principle, with only the musical sequences using live sound recording. The moviegoers were electrified when the silent actions were interrupted periodically for a song sequence with real singing and sound. Jolson's dynamic voice, physical mannerisms, and charisma held the audience spellbound. Costar [[May McAvoy]], according to author A. Scott Berg, could not help sneaking into theaters day after day as the film was being run. "She pinned herself against a wall in the dark and watched the faces in the crowd. In that moment just before 'Toot, Toot, Tootsie,' she remembered, 'A miracle occurred. Moving pictures really came alive. To see the expressions on their faces, when Joley spoke to them ... you'd have thought they were listening to the voice of God.'"&lt;ref&gt;Berg, A. Scott. ''Goldwyn: A Biography'', Alfred A. Knopf (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; "Everybody was mad for the talkies," said movie star [[Gregory Peck]] in a ''Newsweek'' interview. "I remember 'The Jazz Singer,' when Al Jolson just burst into song, and there was a little bit of dialogue. And when he came out with 'Mammy,' and went down on his knees to his Mammy, it was just dynamite."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/88709 "This Is Work, Not Play"], newsweek.com, June 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

This opinion is shared by Mast and Kawin:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...this moment of informal patter at the piano is the most exciting and vital part of the entire movie...when Jolson acquires a voice, the warmth, the excitement, the vibrations of it, the way its rambling spontaneity lays bare the imagination of the mind that is making up the sounds ...[and] the addition of a Vitaphone voice revealed the particular qualities of Al Jolson that made him a star. Not only the eyes are a window on the soul.&lt;ref name=Mast&gt;Mast, Gerald, and Kawin, Bruce F.

====''The Singing Fool'' (1928)====
With Warner Bros. Al Jolson made his first "all-talking" picture, ''[[The Singing Fool]]'' (1928), the story of an ambitious entertainer who insisted on going on with the show even as his small son lay dying. The film was even more popular than ''The Jazz Singer''. Although few theaters were equipped for sound films, ''The Singing Fool'' held the box office attendance record for eleven years until it was broken by ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'' a decade later.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} "Sonny Boy", from the film, was the first American record to sell one million copies.

Jolson continued to make features for Warner Bros. similar in style to ''The Singing Fool''. These included ''[[Say It with Songs]]'' (1929), ''[[Mammy (film)|Mammy]]'' (1930), and ''Big Boy'' (1930). A restored version of ''Mammy'', with Jolson in [[Technicolor]] sequences, was first screened in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.cinema.ucla.edu/newsletter/Archive.AprilMay02.pdf |title=UCLA Film and Television Archive Newsletter |format=PDF |date=April–May 2002 |archivedate=2011-08-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807093523/http://old.cinema.ucla.edu/newsletter/Archive.AprilMay02.pdf |deadurl=yes |df= |access-date=2015-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolson's first Technicolor appearance was a cameo in the musical ''[[Show Girl in Hollywood]]'' (1930) from [[First National Pictures]], a Warner Bros. subsidiary. However, these films gradually proved a cycle of diminishing returns due to their comparative sameness, the regal salary that Jolson demanded, and a shift in public taste away from vaudeville musicals as the 1930s began. Jolson returned to Broadway and starred in the unsuccessful ''Wonder Bar''.{{sfn|Oberfirst|1980|pp=231–235}}

====''Hallelujah, I'm a Bum/Hallelujah, I'm a Tramp''====
Despite these new troubles, Jolson was able to make a comeback after performing a concert in New Orleans after "Wonderbar" closed in 1931.{{Citation needed|reason=No citation provided provided|date=November 2018}} Warners allowed him to make one film with [[United Artists]], ''[[Hallelujah, I'm a Bum (film)|Hallelujah, I'm a Bum]]'', in 1933 (the film had to be retitled ''Hallelujah, I'm a Tramp'' in the UK and other English-speaking countries where "bum" means "bottom" and where the slang word for a vagrant is "tramp" rather than "bum"). It was directed by [[Lewis Milestone]] and written by screenwriter [[Ben Hecht]]. Hecht was also active in the promotion of [[Ben Hecht#Civil rights activism|civil rights]]: "Hecht film stories featuring black characters included ''[[Hallelujah, I'm a Bum (film)|Hallelujah, I'm a Bum]]'', co-starring [[Edgar Connor]] as Al Jolson's sidekick, in a politically savvy rhymed dialogue over [[Richard Rodgers]] music."&lt;ref name=Kovan1&gt;Kovan, Florice Whyte.

A direct response to the Great Depression, it contains messages to his vagabond friends equivalent to "there's more to life than money" and "the best things in life are free".{{Citation needed|reason=No citation provided provided|date=November 2018}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote, "The picture, some persons may be glad to hear, has no Mammy song.

====''Wonder Bar'' (1934)====
In 1934, he starred in a movie version of his earlier stage play ''[[Wonder Bar]]'', co-starring [[Kay Francis]], [[Dolores del Río]], [[Ricardo Cortez]], and [[Dick Powell]]. The movie is a "musical ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'', set in the Parisian nightclub owned by Al Wonder (Jolson). Wonder entertains and banters with his international clientele."&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, James. ''Al Jolson: A Bio-bibliography'' (1994), p. 97.&lt;!-- ISBN, publishing info needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews were generally positive: "''Wonder Bar'' has got about everything. Romance, flash, dash, class, color, songs, star-studded talent and almost every known requisite to assure sturdy attention and attendance... It's Jolson's comeback picture in every respect.";&lt;ref&gt;Abel, ''Variety''. March 6, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; and, "Those who like Jolson should see Wonder Bar for it is mainly Jolson; singing the old reliables; cracking jokes which would have impressed Noah as depressingly ancient; and moving about with characteristic energy."&lt;ref&gt;"At the University", ''Harvard Crimson'', May 21, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Warners, Jolson bowed to new production ideas, focusing less on the star and more on elaborately cinematic numbers staged by [[Busby Berkeley]] and Bobby Connolly.{{Citation needed|reason=No citation provided provided|date=November 2018}} This new approach worked, sustaining Jolson's movie career until the Warner contract lapsed in 1935. Jolson co-starred with his actress-dancer wife, [[Ruby Keeler]], only once, in ''[[Go into Your Dance|Go Into Your Dance]]''.{{Citation needed|reason=No citation provided provided|date=November 2018}}

====''The Singing Kid'' (1936)====
Jolson's last Warner vehicle was ''[[The Singing Kid]]'' (1936), a parody of Jolson's stage persona (he plays a character named Al Jackson) in which he mocks his stage histrionics and taste for "mammy" songs—the latter via a number by [[E. Y. Harburg]] and [[Harold Arlen]] titled "[[I Love to Singa]]", and a comedy sequence with Jolson doggedly trying to sing "Mammy" while The Yacht Club Boys keep telling him such songs are outdated.&lt;ref&gt;Freedland, Michael. ''Jolson – The Story of Al Jolson'' (1972, 2007).&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to jazz historian Michael Alexander, Jolson had once griped that "People have been making fun of Mammy songs, and I don't really think that it's right that they should, for after all, Mammy songs are the fundamental songs of our country." (He said this, in character, in his 1926 short ''[[A Plantation Act]]''.) In this film, he notes, "Jolson had the confidence to rhyme 'Mammy' with 'Uncle Sammy'", adding "Mammy songs, along with the vocation 'Mammy singer', were inventions of the Jewish Jazz Age."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Michael. ''Jazz Age Jews'', Princeton University Press (2003), p. 136.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also gave a boost to the career of black singer and bandleader [[Cab Calloway]], who performed a number of songs alongside Jolson. In his autobiography, Calloway writes about this episode:
{{quote|I'd heard Al Jolson was doing a new film on the Coast, and since [[Duke Ellington]] and his band had done a film, wasn't it possible for me and the band to do this one with Jolson. Frenchy got on the phone to California, spoke to someone connected with the film and the next thing I knew the band and I were booked into Chicago on our way to California for the film, ''The Singing Kid''. We had a hell of a time, although I had some pretty rough arguments with [[Harold Arlen]], who had written the music. Arlen was the songwriter for many of the finest [[Cotton Club]] revues, but he had done some interpretations for ''The Singing Kid'' that I just couldn't go along with. He was trying to change my style and I was fighting it. Finally, Jolson stepped in and said to Arlen, 'Look, Cab knows what he wants to do; let him do it his way.' After that, Arlen left me alone. And talk about integration: Hell, when the band and I got out to Hollywood, we were treated like pure royalty. Here were Jolson and I living in adjacent penthouses in a very plush hotel. We were costars in the film so we received equal treatment, no question about it.&lt;ref&gt;Calloway, Cab. ''Of Minnie the Moocher &amp; Me'', Thomas Y. Crowell Company (1976), p. 131.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Singing Kid'' was not one of the studio's major attractions (it was released by the First National subsidiary), and Jolson did not even rate star billing. The song "I Love to Singa" later appeared in [[Tex Avery]]'s cartoon of the same name. The movie also became the first important role for future child star [[Sybil Jason]] in a scene directed by [[Busby Berkeley]]. Jason remembers that Berkeley worked on the film although he is not credited.&lt;ref name=Fisher103&gt;Fisher, James. ''Al Jolson: A Bio-bibliography'' (1994), p. 103.&lt;!-- publishing info, ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Rose of Washington Square'' (1939)====
His next movie—his first with [[Twentieth Century-Fox]]—was ''[[Rose of Washington Square]]'' (1939). It stars Jolson, [[Alice Faye]] and [[Tyrone Power]], and included many of Jolson's best known songs, although several songs were cut to shorten the movie's length, including "[[April Showers (song)|April Showers]]" and "[[Avalon (Al Jolson song)|Avalon]]". Reviewers wrote, "Mr Jolson's singing of ''Mammy'', [[California, Here I Come]] and others is something for the memory book"&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, Frank S., ''The New York Times'', May 6, 1939, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Of the three co-stars this is Jolson's picture … because it's a pretty good catalog in anybody's hit parade."&lt;ref&gt;''Variety''. May 10, 1939, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was released on DVD in October 2008. 20th Century Fox hired him to recreate a scene from ''The Jazz Singer'' in the [[Alice Faye]]-[[Don Ameche]] film ''Hollywood Cavalcade''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Guest appearances in two more Fox films followed that same year, but Jolson never starred in a full-length feature film again.

===''The Jolson Story''===
[[File:JolsonSingerPoster.JPG|thumb|original movie poster, 1946]]
After the [[George M. Cohan]] film biography, ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky believed that a similar film could be made about Al Jolson. Skolsky pitched the idea of an Al Jolson biopic and [[Harry Cohn]], the head of [[Columbia Pictures]] agreed. It was directed by [[Alfred E. Green]], best remembered for the [[Hays Code|pre-Code]] ''[[Baby Face (film)|Baby Face]]'' (1933), with musical numbers staged by [[Joseph H. Lewis (director)|Joseph H. Lewis]]. With Jolson providing almost all the vocals, and Columbia contract player [[Larry Parks]] playing Jolson, ''[[The Jolson Story]]'' (1946) became one of the biggest box-office hits of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jolsonville.net/2010/02/26/the-jolson-story-opening-review/#more-852 "The Jolson Story" review]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Liberty'', October 19, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry Parks wrote, in a personal tribute to Jolson:&lt;blockquote&gt;Stepping into his shoes was, for me, a matter of endless study, observation, energetic concentration to obtain, perfectly if possible, a simulation of the kind of man he was. It is not surprising, therefore, that while making ''The Jolson Story'', I spent 107 days before the cameras and lost eighteen pounds in weight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jolsonville.net/eulogies/by-larry-parks/ "A Tribute by Larry Parks"], Jolsonville.net; accessed October 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From a review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the real star of the production is that Jolson voice and that Jolson medley. It was good showmanship to cast this film with lesser people, particularly Larry Parks as the mammy kid... As for Jolson's voice, it has never been better. Thus the magic of science has produced a composite whole to eclipse the original at his most youthful best.&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', September 18, 1946, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Parks received an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. Although the 60-year-old Jolson was too old to play a younger version of himself in the movie, he persuaded the studio to let him appear in one musical sequence, "[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]", shot entirely in long shot, with Jolson in blackface singing and dancing onto the runway leading into the middle of the theater. In the wake of the film's success and his World War II tours, Jolson became a top singer among the American public once more.&lt;ref name=pop40t3B&gt;{{Pop Chronicles 40s |3|B}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Oberfirst|1980|p=311}} [[Decca Records]] signed Jolson and he recorded for Decca until his death.

====Critical observations====
According to film historian Krin Gabbard, ''The Jolson Story'' goes further than any of the earlier films in exploring the significance of blackface and the relationships that whites have developed with blacks in the area of music. To him, the film seems to imply an inclination of white performers, like Jolson, who are possessed with "the joy of life and enough sensitivity, to appreciate the musical accomplishments of blacks".&lt;ref&gt;Gabbard, Krin. ''Jammin' at the Margins'' (1996), University of Chicago Press, p. 53.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To support his view he describes a significant part of the movie:
&lt;blockquote&gt;While wandering around New Orleans before a show with Dockstader's Minstrels, he enters a small club where a group of black jazz musicians are performing. Jolson has a revelation, that the staid repertoire of the minstrel troupe can be transformed by actually playing black music in blackface. He tells Dockstader that he wants to sing what he has just experienced: 'I heard some music tonight, something they call jazz. Some fellows just make it up as they go along. They pick it up out of the air.' After Dockstader refuses to accommodate Jolson's revolutionary concept, the narrative chronicles his climb to stardom as he allegedly injects jazz into his blackface performances … Jolson's success is built on anticipating what Americans really want. Dockstader performs the inevitable function of the guardian of the status quo, whose hidebound commitment to what is about to become obsolete reinforces the audience's sympathy with the forward-looking hero.&lt;ref name=Gabbard54&gt;Gabbard, Krin. ''Jammin' at the Margins'', (1996) University of Chicago Press, p. 54.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been a theme which was traditionally "dear to the hearts of the men who made the movies."&lt;ref name=Gabbard54 /&gt; Film historian George Custen describes this "common scenario, in which the hero is vindicated for innovations that are initially greeted with resistance … [T]he struggle of the heroic protagonist who anticipates changes in cultural attitudes is central to other white jazz biopics such as ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Benny Goodman Story]]'' (1955)".&lt;ref name=Custen&gt;Custen, George. ''Bio/Pics: How Hollywood Constructed Public History'', (1992) Rutgers University Press, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; "Once we accept a semantic change from singing to playing the clarinet, ''[[The Benny Goodman Story]]'' becomes an almost transparent reworking of ''The Jazz Singer'' … and ''[[The Jolson Story]]''."&lt;ref name=Gabbard54/&gt;

====''Jolson Sings Again'' (1949)====
A sequel, ''[[Jolson Sings Again]]'' (1949), opened at [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loew]]'s State Theatre in New York and received positive reviews: "Mr. Jolson's name is up in lights again and Broadway is wreathed in smiles", wrote Thomas Pryor in ''The New York Times''. "That's as it should be, for ''Jolson Sings Again'' is an occasion which warrants some lusty cheering...".&lt;ref name="Goldman, Herbert G. 1988 p. 287"&gt;Goldman, Herbert G., ''Jolson – the Legend Comes to Life'' (1988), Oxford Univ. Press, p. 287.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jolson did a tour of New York film theaters to plug the movie, traveling with a police convoy to make timetables for all showings, often ad libbing jokes and performing songs for the audience. Extra police were on duty as crowds jammed the streets and sidewalks at each theater Jolson visited.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Herbert G., Jolson – the Legend Comes to Life, (1988) Oxford Univ. Press, pp. 286–87.&lt;/ref&gt; In Chicago, a few weeks later, he sang to 100,000&amp;nbsp;people at Soldier Field, and later that night appeared at the Oriental Theatre with George Jessel where 10,000&amp;nbsp;people had to be turned away.&lt;ref name="Goldman, Herbert G. 1988 p. 287"/&gt;

In [[Baltimore, Maryland]], he took his wife Erle to St Mary's Industrial School in Baltimore, where he had been confined for a while as a boy and treated for tuberculosis. He introduced her to the same Xaverian Brother, Brother Benjamin, who watched over him. That night, Jolson took over two hundred of the church's kids to see ''Jolson Sings Again'' at the [[Hippodrome Theatre, Baltimore|Hippodrome Theatre]]. A few weeks later, the Jolsons were received by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry Truman]] at the [[White House]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

====Radio shows====
Jolson had been a popular guest star on radio since its earliest days, including on NBC's ''[[The Dodge Victory Hour]]'' (January 1928), singing from a New Orleans hotel to an audience of 35 million via 47 radio stations. His own 1930s shows included ''Presenting Al Jolson'' (1932) and ''[[Shell Chateau]]'' (1935), and he was the host of the ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' from 1947 to 1949, with [[Oscar Levant]] as a sardonic, piano-playing sidekick. Jolson's 1940s career revival was nothing short of a success despite the competition of younger performers such as [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], and he was voted the "Most Popular Male Vocalist" in 1948 by a poll in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. The next year, Jolson was named "Personality of the Year" by the [[Variety Club]]s of America. When Jolson appeared on Bing Crosby's radio show, he attributed his receiving the award to his being the only singer of any importance not to make a record of "[[Mule Train]]", which had been a widely covered hit of that year (four different versions, one of them by Crosby, had made the top ten on the charts). Jolson joked about how his voice had deepened with age, saying "I got the clippetys all right, but I can't clop like I used to."{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In addition to his contribution to motion pictures as a performer, he is responsible for the discovery of two major stars of the golden age of Hollywood. He purchased the rights to a play he saw on Broadway and then sold the movie rights to Jack Warner (Warner Brothers which was the studio that had made ''The Jazz Singer'') with the stipulation that two of the original cast members reprise their roles in the movie. The play became the movie titled "Penny Arcade". Those actors were Joan Blondell and James Cagney. They both went on to become contract players for the studio. The two were major ingredients in gangster movies which were quite lucrative for the studio.

Cagney won his Academy Award for his role in Warner Brothers' "Yankee Doodle Dandy" which at the time was the studio's highest-grossing movie. The award is rarely given to performers in musicals. Ironically Cagney who became known for his tough guy movie roles also made a contribution to movie musicals like the man who had discovered him. While Jolson is credited for appearing in the first movie musical, Cagney's Academy Award-winning movie was the first movie Ted Turner chose to colorize.

====Television work====
When Jolson appeared on [[Steve Allen]]'s [[KNX (AM)|KNX]] Los Angeles radio show in 1949 to promote ''Jolson Sings Again'', he offered his curt opinion of the burgeoning television industry: "I call it smell-evision." Writer Hal Kanter recalled that Jolson's own idea of his television debut would be a corporate-sponsored, extra-length spectacular that would feature him as the only performer, and would be telecast without interruption. Even though he had several TV offers at the time, Jolson was apprehensive about how his larger than life performances would come across in a medium as intimate as television. He finally relented in 1950, when it was announced that Jolson had signed an agreement to appear on the CBS television network, presumably in a series of specials. However, he died suddenly before production began.&lt;ref&gt;Freedland, Michael ''Jolson'' (1972), Stein and Day p. 234.&lt;IBSN 0-8128-1523-8&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II and Korean War tours==

===World War II===
Japanese bombs on [[Pearl Harbor]] shook Jolson out of continuing moods of lethargy due to years of little activity and "... he dedicated himself to a new mission in life.... Even before the [[U.S.O.]] began to set up a formal program overseas, Jolson was deluging War and Navy Department brass with phone calls and wires. He requested permission to go anywhere in the world where there was an American serviceman who wouldn't mind listening to 'Sonny Boy' or 'Mammy'.... [and] early in 1942, Jolson became the first star to perform at a GI base in [[World War II]]".&lt;ref name=Abramson43-44&gt;Abramson, Martin, ''The Real Story of Al Jolson''. 1950, pp. 43–44.&lt;!-- publishing info, ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

From a 1942 interview in ''[[The New York Times]]'': "When the war started... [I] felt that it was up to me to do something, and the only thing I know is show business. I went around during the last war and I saw that the boys needed something besides chow and drills. I knew the same was true today, so I told the people in Washington that I would go anywhere and do an act for the Army."&lt;ref name=Woolf&gt;Woolf, S.J. [http://jolsonville.net/articles/world-war-ii-tours/army-minstrel-1942/ "Army Minstrel."] ''The New York Times''. September 27, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the war began, he wrote a letter to Steven Early, press secretary to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], volunteering "to head a committee for the entertainment of soldiers and said that he "would work without pay... [and] would gladly assist in the organization to be set up for this purpose". A few weeks later, he received his first tour schedule from the newly formed [[United Services Organization]] (USO), "the group his letter to Early had helped create".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Herbert G., ''Jolson – the Legend Comes to Life'' (1988), Oxford Univ. Press, p. 253.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He did as many as four shows a day in the jungle outposts of Central America and covered the string of U.S. Naval bases. He paid for part of the transportation out of his own pocket. Upon doing his first, and unannounced, show in England in 1942, the reporter for the ''Hartford Courant'' wrote, "... it was a panic. And pandemonium... when he was done the applause that shook that soldier-packed room was like bombs falling again in Shaftsbury Avenue."&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse, Ward.

From an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'': 
&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Jolson] has been to more Army camps and played to more soldiers than any other entertainer. He has crossed the Atlantic by plane to take song and cheer to the troops in Britain and Northern Ireland. He has flown to the cold wastes of Alaska and the steaming forests of [[Trinidad]]. He has called at Dutch‑like Curaçao. Nearly every camp in this country has heard him sing and tell funny stories.&lt;ref name=Woolf /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Some of the unusual hardships of performing to active troops were described in an article he wrote for ''Variety'', in 1942: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to entertain all the boys ... it became necessary for us to give shows in foxholes, gun emplacements, dugouts, to construction groups on military roads; in fact, any place where two or more soldiers were gathered together, it automatically became a Winter Garden for me and I would give a show.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Herbert G., ''Jolson -– the Legend Comes to Life'' (1988), Oxford Univ. Press, p. 256.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After returning from a tour of overseas bases, the Regimental Hostess at one camp wrote to Jolson, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Allow me to say on behalf of all the soldiers of the 33rd Infantry that you coming here is quite the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to us, and we think you're tops, not only as a performer, but as a person. We unanimously elect you Public Morale Lifter No. 1 of the U.S Army.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jolson was officially enlisted in the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO), the organization which provided entertainment for American troops who served in combat overseas.{{sfn|Oberfirst|1980|p=285}} Because he was over the age of 45, he received a "Specialist" rating that permitted him to wear a uniform and be given the standing of an officer. While touring in the Pacific, Jolson contracted [[malaria]] and had to have his left lung surgically removed. In 1946, during a nationally broadcast testimonial dinner in New York City, given on his behalf, he received a special tribute from the American Veterans Committee in honor of his volunteer services during World War II.&lt;ref name=pop40t3B/&gt; In 1949, the movie ''[[Jolson Sings Again]]'' recreated some scenes showing Jolson during his war tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC8ZmBIouzQ|title=Broadcast Yourself|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean War===
[[File:Jolson-Korea.jpg|thumb|left|Performing in Korea]]

In 1950, according to Jolson's biographer [[Michael Freedland]],&lt;ref&gt;Freedland, Michael. ''Jolson – The Story of Al Jolson'' (1972, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; "the United States answered the call of the [[United Nations Security Council]] … and had gone to fight the North Koreans. … [Jolson] rang the White House again. 'I'm gonna go to Korea,' he told a startled official on the phone. 'No one seems to know anything about the USO, and it's up to [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] to get me there.' He was promised that President Truman and [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]], who had taken command of the Korean front, would get to hear of his offer. But for four weeks there was nothing. … Finally, [[Louis A. Johnson]], Secretary of Defense, sent Jolson a telegram. 'Sorry for delay but regret no funds for entertainment – STOP; USO disbanded – STOP.' The message was as much an assault on the Jolson sense of patriotism as the actual crossing of the 38th Parallel had been. 'What are they talkin' about', he thundered. 'Funds? Who needs funds? I got funds! I'll pay myself!'"&lt;ref&gt;Freedland, pp. 283–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 1950, a dispatch from 8th Army Headquarters, Korea, announced, "Al Jolson, the first top-flight entertainer to reach the war-front, landed here today by plane from Los Angeles..." Jolson traveled to Korea at his own expense. "[A]nd a lean, smiling Jolson drove himself without letup through 42 shows in 16&amp;nbsp;days."&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Martin, ''The Real Story of Al Jolson'', p. 46 (1950).&lt;!-- publishing info and ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Before returning to the U.S., General [[Douglas MacArthur]], leader of UN forces, gave him a medallion inscribed "To Al Jolson from Special Services in appreciation of entertainment of armed forces personnel ‑ Far East Command", with his entire itinerary inscribed on the reverse side.&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmopolitan Magazine'', January 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, an important bridge, named the "Al Jolson Bridge", was used to withdraw the bulk of American troops from [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, John. ''The Forgotten Punch in the Army's Fist: Korea 1950–1953'', Ken Anderson, (2003), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge was the last remaining of three bridges across the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] and was used to evacuate UN forces.

'''New U.S.O. movie'''
[[File:Marshall-giving-medal-of-merit.jpg|thumb|Defense Secretary [[George Marshall]] presenting the [[Medal for Merit]] to Jolson's family after his death.]]
Just 10 days after he returned from Korea, he had agreed with [[RKO Pictures]] producers [[Jerry Wald]] and [[Norman Krasna]] to star in a new movie, ''Stars and Stripes for Ever'', about a USO troupe in the South Pacific during World War II. The screenplay was to be written by [[Herbert Baker (screenwriter)|Herbert Baker]] and to costar [[Dinah Shore]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1950/10/11/archives/jolson-to-return-to-screen-at-rko-star-agrees-to-role-in-stars-and.html "Jolson to Return to Screen at R.K.O."], ''The New York Times'', October 11, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jolson had however greatly overexerted himself performing in Korea, especially for a man who was missing a lung, and only two weeks after signing the agreement, he died of a heart attack in San Francisco. A few months after his death, Defense Secretary [[George Marshall]] presented the [[Medal for Merit]] for Jolson, "to whom this country owes a debt which cannot be repaid". The medal, carrying a citation noting that Jolson's "contribution to the U.N. action in Korea was made at the expense of his life", was presented to Jolson's adopted son as Jolson's widow looked on.&lt;ref name=Fisher103 /&gt; Columbia too had been thinking about a third Jolson musical, and this time Jolson would play himself. The project, tentatively entitled ''You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet'', was to dramatize Jolson's recent tours of military bases. The projected film was abruptly cancelled.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Personal life==

===Politics===
[[File:Aljolsoncoolidge.jpg|thumb|right|Jolson (right) with President [[Calvin Coolidge]], 1924]]

Jolson was a Republican who supported [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1920 and [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1924 for president. As "one of the biggest stars of his time, [he] worked his magic singing ''Harding, You're the Man for Us'' to enthralled audiences&amp;nbsp;... [and] was subsequently asked to perform ''Keep Cool with Coolidge'' four years later. ...&amp;nbsp;Jolson, like the men who ran the studios, was the rare showbiz Republican."&lt;ref&gt;Kusinitz, Kevin. [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/127joosu.asp "Celebrity Endorsements"], ''The Weekly Standard'', May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Jolson publicly campaigned for Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Oberfirst, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; By the next presidential election (1936), he was back to supporting Republican [[Alf Landon]] and would not support another Democrat for president during his life.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;&lt;ref name=archiveorg/&gt;

===Married life===
====Henrietta Keller====
His first marriage to Henrietta Keller (1889-1967) took place in Alameda California, on September 20, 1907. His name was given as Albert Jolson. They divorced in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/ajolson-wives-keller-delmar.htm|title=Museum of family history.com|last=Details about all Jolson's weddings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethel Delmar====
In 1920, Jolson began a relationship with Broadway actress Alma Osbourne (known professionally as '''Ethel Delmar'''); the two were married in August 1922;&lt;ref&gt;Oberfirst, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; she divorced Jolson in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18178320|title=25 Oct 1950 – Sudden Death Of Al Jolson|website=nla.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ruby Keeler====
In the summer of 1928, Jolson met young tap dancer, and later actress, [[Ruby Keeler]], in Los Angeles (Jolson would claim it was at [[Texas Guinan]]'s night club) and was dazzled by her on sight. Three weeks later, Jolson saw a production of [[George M. Cohan]]'s ''Rise of Rosie O'Reilly'', and noticed she was in the show's cast. Now knowing she was going about her Broadway career, Jolson attended another one of her shows, ''[[Show Girl (1929 musical)|Show Girl]]'', and rose from the audience and engaged in her duet of "Liza". After this moment, the show's producer, [[Florenz Ziegfeld]], asked Jolson to join the cast and continue to sing duets with Keeler. Jolson accepted Ziegfeld's offer and during their tour with Ziegfeld, the two started dating and were married on September 21, 1928. In 1935, Al and Ruby adopted a son, Jolson's first child, whom they named "Al Jolson Jr."&lt;ref name=JolyM /&gt; In 1939, however—despite a marriage that was considered to be more successful than his previous ones—Keeler left Jolson. After their 1940 divorce, she remarried, to John Homer Lowe, with whom she would have four children and remain married until his death in 1969.&lt;ref name=JolyM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberfirst, Robert, ''Al Jolson: You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet'' (1980) Barnes &amp; Co., London, pp. 223–59.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Erle Galbraith====
[[File:Al and Erle Jolson, 1946.jpg|thumb|left|Jolson and wife, Erle, 1946]]
In 1944, while giving a show at a military hospital in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], Jolson met a young X-ray technologist, Erle Galbraith. He became fascinated with her and more than a year later he was able to track her down and hired her as an actress while he served as a producer at Columbia Pictures. After Jolson, whose health was still scarred from his previous battle with [[malaria]], was hospitalized in the winter of 1945, Erle visited him and the two quickly began a relationship. They were married on March 22, 1945. During their marriage, the Jolsons adopted two children, Asa Jr. (born 1948) and Alicia (born 1949),&lt;ref name=JolyM/&gt; and remained married until his death in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Oberfirst, pp. 293–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year and a half of marriage, his new wife had never seen him perform in front of an audience, and the first occasion came unplanned. As told by actor comedian [[Alan King (comedian)|Alan King]], it happened during a dinner by the [[New York Friars' Club]] at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf Astoria]] in 1946, honoring the career of [[Sophie Tucker]]. Jolson and his wife were in the audience along with a thousand others, and [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] was emcee. He asked Al, privately, to perform at least one song. Jolson replied, "No, I just want to sit here."{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Then later, without warning, during the middle of the show, Jessel says, "Ladies and gentlemen, this is the easiest introduction I ever had to make. The world's greatest entertainer, Al Jolson." King recalls what happened next:{{quote|The place is going wild. Jolson gets up, takes a bow, sits down...people start banging with their feet, and he gets up, takes another bow, sits down again. It's chaos, and slowly, he seems to relent. He walks up onto the stage...kids around with Sophie and gets a few laughs, but the people are yelling, 'Sing! Sing! Sing!'...Then he says, 'I'd like to introduce you to my bride,' and this lovely young thing gets up and takes a bow. The audience doesn't care about the bride, they don't even care about Sophie Tucker. 'Sing! Sing! Sing!' they're screaming again.&lt;br /&gt; 'My wife has never seen me entertain', Jolson says, and looks over toward [[Lester Lanin]], the orchestra leader: 'Maestro, is it true what they say about Dixie?'&lt;ref name=King&gt;[[Alan King (comedian)|King, Alan]]. ''Name Dropping'', Simon and Schuster (1997)&lt;!-- publishing info, ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Closeness with his brother Harry===
Despite their close relationship while growing up, Harry did show some disdain for Al's success over the years. Even during their time with Jack Palmer, Al was rising in popularity while Harry was fading. After separating from Al and Jack, Harry's career in show business, however, sank greatly. On one occasion—which was another factor in his on-off relationship with Al—Harry offered to be Al's agent, but Al rejected the offer, worried about the pressure that he would have faced from his producers for hiring his brother as his agent. Shortly after Harry's wife Lillian died in 1948, Harry and Al became close once again.&lt;ref&gt;Oberfirst, pp. 318–324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Al Jolson Grave.JPG|thumb|Tomb of Al Jolson, at Hillside Memorial Park]]
The dust and dirt of the Korean front, from where he had returned a few weeks earlier, had settled in his remaining lung and he was close to exhaustion. While playing cards in his suite at the [[St. Francis Hotel]] at 335 Powell Street in San Francisco,&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Monroe Dyed Here – More Locations of America's Pop Culture Landmarks by Chris Epting, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Jolson died of a massive heart attack on October 23, 1950. His last words were said to be "Oh...oh, I'm going."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|keM4cE7w0n8|Jolson in Korea}}, Video, 9 min&lt;/ref&gt; His age was given as 64.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

After his wife received the news of his death by phone, she went into shock, and required family members to stay with her. At the funeral, police estimated upwards of 20,000&amp;nbsp;people showed up, despite the threat of rain. It became one of the biggest funerals in show business history.&lt;ref name="Goldman, Herbert G. 1988 p. 300"&gt;Goldman, Herbert G., Jolson – the Legend Comes to Life, (1988) Oxford Univ. Press, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrities paid tribute: [[Bob Hope]], speaking from Korea via short wave radio, said the world had lost "not only a great entertainer, but also a great citizen." [[Larry Parks]] said that the world had "lost not only its greatest entertainer, but a great American as well. He was a casualty of the [Korean] war." Scripps-Howard newspapers drew a pair of white gloves on a black background. The caption read, "The Song Is Ended."&lt;ref name="Goldman, Herbert G. 1988 p. 300"/&gt;

Newspaper columnist and radio reporter [[Walter Winchell]] said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was the first to entertain troops in World War Two, contracted malaria and lost a lung. Then in his upper sixties he was again the first to offer his singing gifts for bringing solace to the wounded and weary in Korea.&lt;br&gt;Today we know the exertion of his journey to Korea took a greater toll of his strength than perhaps even he realized. But he considered it his duty as an American to be there, and that was all that mattered to him. Jolson died in a San Francisco hotel. Yet he was as much a battle casualty as any American soldier who has fallen on the rocky slopes of Korea … A star for more than 40 years, he earned his most glorious star rating at the end—a gold star.&lt;ref name=Winchell&gt;Winchell, Walter. [http://jolsonville.net/eulogies/by-walter-winchell "A Song for Al Jolson"], jolsonville.net; accessed September 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Friend George Jessel said during part of his eulogy, {{quote|The history of the world does not say enough about how important the song and the singer have been. But history must record the name Jolson, who in the twilight of his life sang his heart out in a foreign land, to the wounded and to the valiant.

He was interred in the [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in Culver City, California. Jolson's widow purchased a plot at Hillside and commissioned his mausoleum to be designed by well-known black architect [[Paul Williams (architect)|Paul Williams]]. The six-pillar marble structure is topped by a dome, next to a three-quarter-size bronze statue of Jolson, eternally resting on one knee, arms outstretched, apparently ready to break into another verse of "Mammy". The inside of the dome features a huge mosaic of Moses holding the tablets containing the Ten Commandments, and identifies Jolson as "The Sweet Singer of Israel" and "The Man Raised Up High".&lt;ref name=jolsonville/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jolson.org/ International Al Jolson Society], jolson.org; accessed October 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day he died, Broadway dimmed its lights in Jolson's honor, and radio stations all over the world were paying tributes. Soon after his death, the BBC presented a special program entitled ''Jolson Sings On''. His death unleashed tributes from all over the world, including a number of eulogies from friends, including George Jessel, Walter Winchell, and [[Eddie Cantor]].&lt;ref name=jolsonville&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jolsonville.net|title=Tribute site|publisher=Jolsonville.net|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed millions to Jewish and other charities in his will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/jolson.html|title=Al Jolson|author=Brody, Seymour|work=Jewish Heroes &amp; Heroines of America: 150 True Stories of American Jewish Heroism|publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|year=1996|accessdate=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty-four years after Jolson's death, the United States Postal Service honored him by issuing a postage stamp. The 29-cent stamp was unveiled by Erle Jolson Krasna, Jolson's fourth wife, at a ceremony in New York City's Lincoln Center on September 1, 1994. This stamp was one of a series honoring popular American singers, which included Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, Ethel Merman, and Ethel Waters. In 2006, Jolson had a street in New York named after him with the help of the Al Jolson Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jolson.org|title=jolson.org|website=jolson.org|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 the documentary ''Al Jolson and The Jazz Singer'' premiered at the 50th [[Lübeck Nordic Film Days]], Lübeck, Germany, and won 1st Prize at an annual film competition in Kiel a few weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imkin.de/ki/informieren/aktuelles/artikel.php?archiv=4727 |title=''Al Jolson and The Jazz Singer'' wins 1st Prize |date=November 15, 2008 |language=de |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719071238/http://www.oksh.de/ki/informieren/aktuelles/artikel.php?archiv=4727 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |deadurl=yes |df= |access-date=2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, a similar documentary, ''A Look at Al Jolson'', was winner at the same festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oksh.de/sh/informieren/aktuelles/artikel.php?archiv=2993 ''A Look at Al Jolson'', winner at German film festival] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719070815/http://www.oksh.de/sh/informieren/aktuelles/artikel.php?archiv=2993 |date=2011-07-19 }} November, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influence==
[[File:Berlin-Jolson27.JPG|thumb|&lt;div class=center&gt;With [[Irving Berlin]], circa 1927&lt;/div&gt;]]
According to music historians Bruce Crowther and Mike Pinfold: "During his time he was the best known and most popular all-around entertainer America (and probably the world) has ever known, captivating audiences in the theatre and becoming an attraction on records, radio, and in films. He opened the ears of white audiences to the existence of musical forms alien to their previous understanding and experience … and helped prepare the way for others who would bring a more realistic and sympathetic touch to black musical traditions."&lt;ref name=Crowther/&gt; Black songwriter [[Noble Sissle]], in the 1930s, said "[h]e was always the champion of the Negro songwriter and performer, and was first to put Negroes in his shows". Of Jolson's "Mammy" songs, he adds, "with real tears streaming down his blackened face, he immortalized the Negro motherhood of America as no individual could."&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Arthur. ''Disintegrating the Musical: Black Performance and American Musical film'', Duke University Press (2002).&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USPOD Al Jolson 1977 First Day Cover-excised address.jpg|thumb|right|"50th Anniversary Year of Talking Pictures" stamp on first-day-of-issue cover featuring Jolson]]

However, Jolson's signature style, loud and passionate, was soon eclipsed by the cooler and more intimate style of the [[crooners]], singers such as Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, who dominated the pop charts in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. While Jolson could and did croon, his basic style was formed in the era when a singer needed to project to the back of a theater with his own physical power; later singers who developed in the microphone era were freed from this constraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shsu.edu/~lis_fwh/book/roots_of_rock/support/crooner/EarlyCroonersIntro2.htm |title=The Coming of the Crooners |author=Ian Whitcomb|editor=Frank Hoffmann|work=Survey of American Popular Music|publisher=Sam Houston State University|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pitts|first1=Michael|last2=Hoffman|first2=Frank|last3=Carty|first3=Dick|last4=Bedoian|first4=Dick|title=The Rise of the Crooners: Gene Austin, Russ Columbo, Bing Crosby, Nick Lucas, Johnny Marvin and Rudy Vallee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Deb9AAAAQBAJ|year=2002|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-4081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of the people and places that have been influenced by Jolson:

'''[[Tony Bennett]]'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;My father...took us to see one of the first talking pictures, ''The Singing Fool'', in which Al Jolson sang "Sonny Boy". In a way, you could say that Jolson was my earliest influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I saw that I spent hours listening to Jolson and Eddie Cantor on the radio. In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie...to imitate Jolson...I leaped into the living room and announced to the adults, who were staring at me in amazement, "Me Sonny Boy!" The whole family roared with laughter.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Tony and Friedwald, Will. ''The Good Life'', Simon and Schuster (1998).&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''[[Irving Berlin]]'''
:As the movies became a vital part of the entertainment industry, Berlin was forced to "reinvent himself as a songwriter". Biographer Laurence Bergreen wrote that while Berlin's music was "Too old-fashioned for progressive Broadway, his music was thoroughly up-to-date in conservative Hollywood." He had his earliest luck with the landmark sound film ''The Jazz Singer'' (1927), in which Jolson performed his song "Blue Skies".&lt;ref name=Bergreen&gt;Bergreen, Laurence. ''As Thousands Cheer: The Life of Irving Berlin'', Da Capo Press (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the music for Jolson's film ''Mammy'' (1930), which included hits such as "Let Me Sing and I'm Happy", "Pretty Baby", and "Mammy".&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;&lt;ref name=archiveorg/&gt;

'''[[Bing Crosby]]'''
:Music historian Richard Grudens writes that [[Kathryn Crosby]] cheerfully reviewed the chapter about her beloved Bing and his inspiration, Al Jolson...where Bing had written, "His chief attribute was the sort of electricity he generated when he sang. Nobody in those days did that. When he came out and started to sing, he just elevated that audience immediately. Within the first eight bars he had them in the palm of his hand."&lt;ref name=Crowther&gt;Crowther, Bruce, and Pinfold, Mike. ''Singing Jazz: The Singers and Their Styles'', Hal Leonard Corp. (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; In Crosby's ''[[Pop Chronicles]]'' interview, he fondly recalled seeing Jolson perform and praised his "electric delivery".&lt;ref name=pop40t3B /&gt; Crosby's biographer Gary Giddins wrote of Crosby's admiration for Jolson's performance style: "Bing marveled at how he seemed to personally reach each member of the audience." Crosby once told a fan, "I'm not an electrifying performer at all. I just sing a few little songs. But this man could really galvanize an audience into a frenzy. He could really tear them apart."&lt;ref name=Giddins&gt;Giddins, Gary. ''Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams'', Back Bay (2002).&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Bobby Darin]]'''
:Darin's biographer, David Evanier, writes that when Darin was a youngster, stuck at home because of rheumatic fever, "[h]e spent most of the time reading and coloring as well as listening to the big-band music and Jolson records... He started to do Jolson imitations...he was crazy about Jolson." Darin's manager, Steve Blauner, who also became a movie producer and vice president of [[Screen Gems]], likewise began his career "as a little boy doing Al Jolson imitations after seeing ''The Jolson Story'' 13 times."&lt;ref&gt;Evanier, David. ''Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin'', Rodale, p. 58 (2004).&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Neil Diamond]]'''
:Journalist David Wild writes that the 1927 movie ''The Jazz Singer'', would mirror Diamond's own life, "the story of a Jewish kid from New York who leaves everything behind to pursue his dream of making popular music in Los Angeles". Diamond says it was "the story of someone who wants to break away from the traditional family situation and find his own path. And in that sense, it 'is' my story." In 1972, Diamond gave the first solo concert performance on Broadway since Al Jolson, and starred in the 1980 remake of ''Jazz Singer'', with [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Lucie Arnaz]].&lt;ref&gt;Wild, David. ''He Is … I say: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Neil Diamond'', Da Capo Press (2008).&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]]'''
:On a tour of the Soviet Union with his then wife, [[Elizabeth Taylor]], Fisher wrote in his autobiography that "Khrushchev's mistress asked me to sing... I was the first American to be invited to sing in the Kremlin since [[Paul Robeson]]. The next day the Herald-Tribune headlines [read] 'Eddie Fisher Rocks the Kremlin'. I gave them my best Jolson: "Swanee", "April Showers" and finally "Rock-A-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody". I had the audience of Russian diplomats and dignitaries on their feet swaying with me."&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Eddie. ''Been There, Done That: An Autobiography'', Macmillan (2000), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, Fisher dedicated his "smash hit" song, "Good-bye, G.I. Al," to Jolson, and presented a copy personally to Jolson's widow.&lt;ref&gt;''Billboard'', April 14, 1951, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; With one of his later wives, [[Connie Stevens]], he had a daughter, [[Joely Fisher]], whose name honors Jolson.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''[[Judy Garland]]'''
:Garland performed a tribute to Jolson in her concerts of 1951 at the [[London Palladium]] and at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theater]] in New York City. Both concerts were to become "central to this first of her many comebacks, and centered around her impersonation of Al Jolson...performing 'Swanee' in her odd vocal drag of Jolson."&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;&lt;ref name=archiveorg/&gt;

'''[[Ernest Hemingway]]'''
:In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'', Ernest Hemingway wrote that "Zelda Fitzgerald...leaned forward and said to me, telling me her great secret, 'Ernest, don't you think Al Jolson is greater than Jesus?'" &lt;ref&gt;Hemingway, Ernest. ''A Moveable Feast'', Scribner (1964), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Jerry Lewis]]'''
:Actor and comedian Jerry Lewis starred in a televised version (without blackface) of ''The Jazz Singer'' in 1959. Lewis's biographer, Murray Pomerance, writes, "Jerry surely had his father in mind when he remade the film", adding that Lewis himself "told an interviewer that his parents had been so poor that they could not afford to give him a bar mitzvah." In 1956, Lewis recorded "Rock-a-Bye Your Baby".&lt;ref&gt;Pomerance, Murray. ''Enfant Terrible: Jerry Lewis in American Film'', New York University Press (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Jerry Lee Lewis]]'''
:According to singer and songwriter Jerry Lee Lewis, "there were only four true American originals: Al Jolson, [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Hank Williams]], and Jerry Lee Lewis."&lt;ref&gt;''Rolling Stone Magazine'', Interviews, October 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; "I loved Al Jolson," he said. "I still got all of his records. Even back when I was a kid I listened to him all the time."&lt;ref&gt;Giddins, Gary. ''Visions of Jazz: The First Century'', Oxford Univ. Press (1998) p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Mario Lanza]]'''
:Mario Lanza's biographer, Armando Cesari, writes that Lanza's "favorite singers included Al Jolson, Lena Horne, Tony Martin and Toni Arden."&lt;ref&gt;Cesari, Armando. ''Mario Lanza: An American Tragedy'', Baskerville Publishers (2004), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[David Lee Roth]]'''
:Songwriter and lead singer of the rock group Van Halen, was asked during an interview in 1985, "When did you first decide that you wanted to go into show business?" He replied, "I was seven. I said I wanted to be Al Jolson. Those were the only records I had—a collection of the old breakable 78s. I learned every song and then the moves, which I saw in the movies."&lt;ref&gt;''Rolling Stone'' Interviews, April 11, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Rod Stewart]]'''
:British singer and songwriter Rod Stewart, during an interview in 2003, was asked, "What is your first musical memory?" Stewart replied: "Al Jolson, from when we used to have house parties around Christmas or birthdays. We had a small grand piano and I used to sneak downstairs... I think it gave me a very, very early love of music."&lt;ref&gt;''Rolling Stone'', Interviews, October 30, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Jackie Wilson]]'''
:African-American singer Jackie Wilson recorded a tribute album to Jolson, ''You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet'', which included his personal liner note, "the greatest entertainer of this or any other era... I guess I have just about every recording he's ever made, and I rarely missed listening to him on the radio...During the three years I've been making records, I've had the ambition to do an album of songs, which, to me, represent the great Jolson heritage.. [T]his is simply my humble tribute to the one man I admire most in this business... to keep the heritage of Jolson alive."&lt;ref&gt;Giddins, Gary. ''Rhythm-a-ning: Jazz Tradition and Innovation'', Da Capo (2000), pp. 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[State of California]]'''
:According to California historians Stephanie Barron and Sheri Bernstein, "few artists have done as much to publicize California as did Al Jolson" who performed and wrote the lyrics for "[[California, Here I Come]]".&lt;ref&gt;Barron, Stephanie, and Bernstein, Sheri. ''Reading California Art, Image, and Identity'', Univ. of California Press (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the unofficial song of the Golden State.&lt;ref&gt;Studwell, William E. and Schueneman, Bruce R., ''State Songs of the United States: An Annotated Anthology'', Haworth Press (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the 1928 song "Golden Gate" ([[Dave Dreyer]], [[Joseph Meyer (songwriter)|Joseph Meyer]], [[Billy Rose]] &amp; Jolson).&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/al-jolson PBS "Stars over Broadway"], pbs.org; Retrieved October 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archiveorg"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/AlJolson Collected works of Al Jolson at the Internet Archive], archive.org; Retrieved October 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

His మరణం నా చివరి చరణం కాదు
వాడు ముందే వానా పాము ముడ్డి ఏటో మూతి ఏటో...
తను శవమై....
ఒక్కరికి వశమై....
తనువు పుండై...
ఒక్కడికి పండై...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30461">'''Anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States''' has existed since the late 18th century. It has started from 1864, when the Chinese built the Transcontinental Railroad.  In 1882, The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was added.  Its origins have been traced to the American merchants, missionaries, and diplomats who sent home from China "relentlessly negative" reports of the people they encountered there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gyory|first=Andrew|title=Closing the Gate: Race, Politics, and the Chinese Exclusion Act|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year= 1998|location=Chapel Hill|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attitudes were transmitted to Americans who never left North America, triggering talk of the [[Yellow Peril]], and continued through the [[Cold War]] during [[McCarthyism]]. Modern anti-Chinese sentiment is the result of [[China's peaceful rise|China's rise]] as a major world power. Anti-Chinese sentiment or [[sinophobia]] is a  broad opposition or hostility to the [[Chinese people|people]], policies, [[Chinese culture|culture]], or [[Politics of the People's Republic of China|politics of China]].

==Early Chinese immigration to the United States==
{{main article|Yellow Peril}}
Starting with the [[California Gold Rush]] in the middle 19th century, the United States—particularly the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] states—imported large numbers of Chinese migrant laborers. Early Chinese immigrant worked as gold miners, and later on subsequent large labor projects, such as the building of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The decline of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in China caused many Chinese to emigrate overseas in search of a more stable life, and this coincided with the rapid growth of American industry. The Chinese were considered by employers as "reliable" workers who would continue working, without complaint, even under destitute conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Norton|first=Henry K.|title=The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present|publisher=A.C. McClurg &amp; Co.|year= 1924|location=Chicago|pages=283–296|url=http://www.sfmuseum.net/hist6/chinhate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese migrant workers encountered considerable prejudice in the United States, especially by the people who occupied the lower layers in white society, because Chinese "[[coolies]]" were used as a scapegoat for depressed wage levels by politicians and labor leaders.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5046/%7C&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of physical assaults on Chinese include the [[Chinese massacre of 1871]] in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[murder of Vincent Chin]]. The 1909  murder of [[Elsie Sigel]] in New York, of which a Chinese person was suspected, was blamed on the Chinese in general and led to physical violence. "The murder of Elsie Sigel immediately grabbed the front pages of newspapers, which portrayed Chinese men as dangerous to "innocent" and "virtuous" young white women. This murder led to a surge in the harassment of Chinese in communities across the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese St. Louis: From Enclave to Cultural Community|first=Huping|last=Ling|publisher=[[Temple University Press]]|year=2004|page=68|quote=The murder of Elsie Sigel immediately grabbed the front pages of newspapers, which portrayed Chinese men as dangerous to "innocent" and "virtuous" young white women. This murder led to a surge in the harassment of Chinese in communities across the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emerging American [[trade unions]], under such leaders as [[Samuel Gompers]], also took an outspoken anti-Chinese position,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meat vs. Rice: American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism: Which Shall Survive?|first=Samuel|last=Gompers|authorlink=Samuel Gompers|first2=Herman|last2=Gustadt|publisher=[[American Federation of Labor]]|year=1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding Chinese laborers as competitors to white laborers.  Only with the emergence of the international trade union [[Industrial Workers of the World]] did trade unionists start to accept Chinese workers as part of the American working-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chinese American Transnational Politics|author=Lai, Him Mark|authorlink=Him Mark Lai|author2=Hsu, Madeline Y.|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=2010|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the phrase "yellow peril" was popularized in the U.S. by [[newspapers]] owned by [[William Randolph Hearst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746032,00.html | work=Time | title=Foreign News: Again, Yellow Peril | date=1933-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also the title of a popular book by an influential U.S. religious figure, [[G. G. Rupert]], who published ''The Yellow Peril; or, Orient vs. Occident'' in 1911.  Based on the phrase "the kings from the East" in the Christian scriptural verse Revelation 16:12,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%2016:12-16:12&amp;version=50 |title=Revelation 16:12 (New King James Version) |publisher=BibleGateway.com |accessdate=2007-11-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118114642/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%2016%3A12-16%3A12&amp;version=50 |archivedate=18 November 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert, who believed in the doctrine of [[British Israelism]], claimed that China, India, Japan and Korea were attacking England and the U.S., but that [[Jesus Christ]] would stop them.&lt;ref name="NYU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boas.wordpress.com/2006/08/19/nyus-archivist-of-the-yellow-peril-exhibit/ |title=NYU’s "Archivist of the Yellow Peril" Exhibit |publisher=Boas Blog |date=2006-08-19 |accessdate=2007-11-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013201844/http://boas.wordpress.com/2006/08/19/nyus-archivist-of-the-yellow-peril-exhibit/ |archivedate=13 October 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1982 book ''The Yellow Peril: Chinese Americans in American fiction, 1850-1940'', [[William F. Wu]] states that "Pulp magazines in the 30s had a lot of yellow peril characters loosely based on [[Fu Manchu]]... Most were of Chinese descent, but because of the geopolitics at the time, a growing number of people were seeing Japan as a threat, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5043319/the-yellow-peril-fu-manchu-and-the-ethnic-future|title=The Yellow Peril, Fu Manchu, and the Ethnic Future|author=LISA KATAYAMA|work=io9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese Exclusion Act and legal discrimination===
{{main article|Anti-Chinese legislation in the United States|Chinese Exclusion Act}}
[[File:Willard B. Farwell, Official Map of Chinatown 1885, Cornell CUL PJM 1093 01.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.6|This map was published in 1885 as part of an official report of a Special Committee established by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors "on the Condition of the Chinese Quarter".&lt;ref name=BoS-85&gt;{{cite book |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100158894 |title=The Chinese at home and abroad: together with the Report of the Special Committee of the Board of Supervisors of San Francisco on the Condition of the Chinese quarter of that city |author=Farwell, Willard B. |date=1885 |publisher=A.L. Bancroft &amp; Co. |location=San Francisco |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 1870s and 1880s various legal discriminatory measures were taken against the Chinese. These laws, in particular the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, were aimed at restricting further immigration from China,&lt;ref name="yeefow"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink= |title=An Evidentiary Timeline on the History of Sacramento's Chinatown: 1882 - American Sinophobia, The Chinese Exclusion Act and "The Driving Out"|work=|publisher=Friends of the Yee Fow Museum, [[Sacramento, California]]|date=|url=http://www.yeefow.com/past/1882.html |doi=|accessdate=2008-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the laws were later repealed by the [[Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943]]. Another key piece of legislation was the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]], which extended citizenship rights to African Americans but barred Chinese from naturalization on the grounds that they and other Asians could not be assimilated into American society. Unable to become citizens, Chinese immigrants were prohibited from voting and serving on juries, and dozens of states passed [[alien land laws]] that prohibited non-citizens from purchasing real estate, thus preventing them from establishing permanent homes and businesses. The idea of an "unassimilable" race became a common argument in the exclusionary movement against Chinese Americans. In particular, even in his lone dissent against [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] (1896), then-[[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] wrote of the Chinese as: "a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chin|first=Gabriel J.|title=Harlan, Chinese and Chinese Americans|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/02rights/immigr10.htm|publisher=University of Dayton Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA xenophobic fears against the alleged "Yellow Peril" led to the implementation of the [[Page Act of 1875]], the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]], expanded ten years later by the [[Geary Act]]. The [[Immigration Act of 1917]] then created an "Asian Barred Zone" under [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] influence.

The Chinese Exclusion Act was one of the most significant restrictions on free immigration in U.S. history. The Act excluded Chinese "skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining" from entering the country for ten years under penalty of imprisonment and deportation. Many Chinese were relentlessly beaten just because of their race.&lt;ref name="mem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/learn//features/immig/chinese6.html|title=Exclusion|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=2003-09-01|accessdate=2010-01-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090810043800/http://memory.loc.gov/learn//features/immig/chinese6.html| archivedate=August 10, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usn"&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page47.htm usnews.com: The People's Vote: Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328000000/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page47.htm |date=March 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The few Chinese non-laborers who wished to immigrate had to obtain certification from the Chinese government that they were qualified to immigrate, which tended to be difficult to prove.&lt;ref name="usn"/&gt;

The 1921 [[Emergency Quota Act]], and then the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], restricted immigration according to national origins. While the Emergency Quota Act used the [[census of the United States|census]] of 1910, xenophobic fears in the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] community lead to the adoption of the 1890 census, more favorable to [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] (WASP) population, for the uses of the Immigration Act of 1924, which responded to rising immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as Asia.

One of the goal of this [[National Origins Formula]], established in 1929, was explicitly to keep the status quo distribution of [[ethnicity]], by allocating quotas in proportion to the actual population. The idea was that immigration would not be allowed to change the "national character". Total annual immigration was capped at 150,000. Asians were excluded but residents of nations in the Americas were not restricted, thus making official the racial discrimination in [[List of United States immigration legislation|immigration laws]]. This system was repealed with the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]].

===Chinese Labours and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882===
{{main article|Chinese Exclusion Act}}
According to statistics, between 1820 and 1840, only 11 Chinese people emigrated to the United States. However, many Chinese were living in distress due to the end of the Qing Dynasty. The United States offered a more stable life, thanks to the gold rush in California, the construction of railways, and the resulting large demand for labor. Beginning in 1848, many Chinese chose to immigrate to the US.

In order to recruit more laborers, the United States and China signed the [[Burlingame Treaty]] in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1163/187656110X523717 |first=John |last=Schrecker |title="For the Equality of Men - For the Equality of Nations": Anson Burlingame and China's First Embassy to the United States, 1868. |journal=Journal of American-East Asian Relations |date=March 2010 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=9-34 |issn=1058-3947}}&amp;nbsp;[https://burlingame.wikispaces.com/file/view/Burlingame+JAEAR.pdf Alternate URL]&lt;/ref&gt; The Burlingame Treaty provided several rights, including that Chinese people can freely enter and leave the United States; the right of abode in the United States; and the United States most-favored treatment of Chinese nationals in the United States. The Treaty stimulated immigration for the 20 years between 1853 to 1873, and resulted in the immigration of nearly 105,000 Chinese to the United States by 1880.&lt;ref name=Chin-2013 /&gt;

1882 was an election year in California. In order to secure more votes, California politicians adopted a staunch anti-China stance. In Congress, California Republican Senator [[John Franklin Miller (senator)|John Miller]] spoke at length in support of a bill to prohibit further Chinese immigrants, substantially the same as one from the prior session of Congress that had been vetoed by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. Senator Miller submitted a motion to ban the immigration Chinese laborers for 20 years, citing the passage of the 1879 anti-Chinese referendums in California and Nevada by huge margins as proof of popular support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DAC18820301.2.42 |title=Senator Miller's Great Anti-Chinese Speech |author= |date=1 March 1882 |newspaper=Daily Alta California |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion was discussed in the Senate over the next eight days. All the Senators from western states and most of the southern Democratic Party supported Miller's proposal, strenuously objected to the eastern states senator. After intense debate, the motion eventually passed the Senate by a vote of 29 of 15; it would go on to pass in the House of Representatives on March 23, by 167 votes to 66 votes (55 abstentions).&lt;ref name=Chin-2013 /&gt;

President [[Chester A. Arthur]] vetoed the bill on April 4, 1882, as it violated the provisions of the [[Angell Treaty]], which restricted but did not ban immigration from China. Congress was unable to overturn the veto, and passed a version of the bill that banned immigration for ten years in lieu of the original twenty-year ban. On May 6, 1882, Miller's proposal was signed by President Arthur, and became the [[Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]].&lt;ref name=Chin-2013&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/85234407/chinese-exclusion-act-1882 |author=Chin, Philip |title=The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 |journal=Chinese American Forum |date=January 2013 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=8-13}}&amp;nbsp;Direct URLs: [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%201.pdf Part 1] [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%202.pdf Part 2] [http://www.chineseamericanheroes.org/history/Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20Part%203.pdf Part 3]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Amendments introduced during the debate over the bill prohibited the naturalization of Chinese immigrants.&lt;ref name=Chin-2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LoC-CEA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/chinese.html |title=Primary Documents in American History: Chinese Exclusion Act |date= |publisher=The Library of Congress |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial ten-year ban ended, Chinese Exclusion was extended in 1892 by the [[Geary Act]] and then made permanent in 1902.&lt;ref name=LoC-CEA /&gt; California Governor [[John McDougal]] in 1851 praised the Chinese as "the most valuable immigrants" to California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.csiel.org/Upload/ueditor/files/2016-10-24/C%20.626%EF%BC%8C%E8%AF%84%E9%BB%84%E7%A5%B8%E8%AE%BA%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%AC%E6%BA%90_%E6%9C%AC%E8%B4%A8%EF%BC%88%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89-bd4a2d13-b095-42d2-913c-28dd17eb58da.pdf |title=On the Source, Essence of “Yellow Peril” Doctrine and Its Latest Hegemony “Variant” – the “China Threat” Doctrine: From the Perspective of Historical Mainstream of Sino-Foreign Economic Interactions and Their Inherent Jurisprudential Principles |author=Chen, An |journal=The Journal of World Investment &amp; Trade |volume=13 |date=2012 |pages=1–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The origin of this quotation is unclear and it is commented out until it can be confirmed: recently accepted most valuable immigrants, but 30 years later, "the most valuable immigrants barred from the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Affairs,Immigration in a Changing Economy: California's Experience./ Forbidden Workers: Illegal Chinese Immigrants and American Labor.

==Cold War==
{{main article|Red Scare}}
Anti-Chinese sentiment during the Cold War was largely the result of the Red Scare and [[McCarthyism]], which coincided with increased popular fear of communist [[espionage]] because of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and China's involvement in the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name="Schr"&gt;{{cite book| last = Schrecker| first =  Ellen| year = 1998| title = Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America| publisher = Little, Brown| isbn = 0-316-77470-7|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the era, suspected Communists were imprisoned in the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs.&lt;ref name="Schr"/&gt; Many of those who were imprisoned, lost their jobs or were questioned by committees, had a real past or present connection of some kind with the Communist Party. However, for the vast majority, both the potential for them to do harm to the nation and the nature of their communist affiliation were tenuous.&lt;ref name="Schr2"&gt;{{cite book| last = Schrecker| first =  Ellen| year = 1998| title = Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America| publisher = Little, Brown| isbn = 0-316-77470-7|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these victims were [[Chinese American]]s, who were suspected of being affiliated with the [[Communist Party]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]].

===Deportation of Qian Xuesen===
The most notable example is that of the top Chinese scientist [[Qian Xuesen]]. Allegations were made that he was a communist, and his security clearance was revoked in June 1950.&lt;ref name="caltech1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id%3D39604|title=Tsien Hsue-Shen Dies|last=|first=|date=November 2, 2009|website=|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928124208/http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id=39604|archivedate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] located an [[American Communist Party]] document from 1938 with his name on it, and used it as justification for the revocation. Without his clearance, Qian found himself unable to pursue his career, and within two weeks, he announced plans to return to mainland [[China]], which had come under the government of Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]]. The [[Undersecretary of the Navy]] at the time, [[Dan A. Kimball]], tried to keep Qian in the US: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist than I was, and we forced him to go.&lt;ref name="autogenerated57"&gt;Perrett, B. (January 7, 2008), Sea Change, Aviation Week and Space Technology, Vol. 168, No. 1, p.57-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Qian would spend the next five years under house arrest, which included constant surveillance with the permission to teach without any research (classified) duties.&lt;ref name="caltech1"/&gt; Caltech appointed attorney [[Grant Cooper (attorney)|Grant Cooper]] to defend Qian. In 1955, the United States deported him to China in exchange for five American pilots captured during the [[Korean War]]. Later, he became the father of the modern [[Chinese space program]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-02-06/us-trained-scientist-was-deported-then-became-father-chinese-rocketry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/world/asia/04qian.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-me-qian-xuesen1-2009nov01-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
{{see also|Chinese Century}}
Modern anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States may originate from American fears of China's role as a rising power. Perceptions of China's rise have been so widespread that 'rise of China' has been named the top news story of the 21st century by the [[Global Language Monitor]], as measured by number of appearances in the global print and electronic media, on the Internet and blogosphere, and in Social Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|url=http://www.ycwb.com/ePaper/xkb/html/2011-05/07/content_1105830.htm|title=21世纪新闻排行中国崛起居首位|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese exclusion policy of NASA ===
As part of the [[Chinese exclusion policy of NASA]], many American space researchers were prohibited from working with Chinese citizens affiliated with a Chinese state enterprise or entity.&lt;ref name="guardiannasa"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ian Sample|title=US scientists boycott Nasa conference over China ban|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/05/us-scientists-boycott-nasa-china-ban|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, the [[112th United States Congress]] banned NASA from using its funds to host Chinese visitors at NASA facilities.&lt;ref name="justice1"&gt;{{citation|first=Virginia|last=Seitz|title=Memorandum Opinion for the General Counsel, Office of Science and Technology Policy|url=http://www.justice.gov/olc/2011/conduct-diplomacy.pdf|journal=Office of Legal Counsel|volume=35|date=11 September 2011|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 2010, Rep.

=== Donald Trump 2016 campaign ===
[[Donald Trump]] took a number of anti-Chinese stances during the 2016 campaign such as saying that China is "raping" the U.S. with free trade. 

In November 2015, Trump promised to designate China as a [[renminbi currency value|currency manipulator]] on his first day in office.&lt;ref name="PalmerSchreckinger"&gt;Doug Palmer &amp; Ben Schreckinger, [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/donald-trump-china-currency-manipulation-215679 Trump's trade views vows to declare China a currency manipulator on Day One], ''Politico'' (November 10, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; He pledged "swift, robust and unequivocal" action against Chinese piracy, [[counterfeit consumer goods|counterfeit]] American goods, and the theft of American [[trade secret]]s and [[intellectual property]]. He also condemned China's "illegal [[export subsidy|export subsidies]] and lax labor and environmental standards."&lt;ref name="PalmerSchreckinger" /&gt;

In January 2016, Trump proposed a 45% [[tariff]] on [[List of the largest trading partners of China|Chinese exports to the United States]] to give "American workers a level playing field."&lt;ref name="Haberman"&gt;Maggie Haberman, [https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/07/donald-trump-says-he-favors-big-tariffs-on-chinese-exports/ Donald Trump Says He Favors Big Tariffs on Chinese Exports], ''The New York Times'' (January 7, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Appelaum2"&gt;Binyamin Appelaum, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/11/us/politics/-trade-donald-trump-breaks-200-years-economic-orthodoxy-mercantilism.html On Trade, Donald Trump Breaks With 200 Years of Economic Orthodoxy], ''The New York Times'' (March 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about potential Chinese retaliation to the implementation of tariffs, such as sales of [[US bonds]], Trump judged such a scenario to be unlikely: "They won't crash our currency. They will crash their economy. That's what they are going to do if they start playing that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/02/11/donald-trump-on-trade-deficit-with-china/|title=Donald Trump on the trade deficit with China|date=February 11, 2016|publisher=Fox News|language=en-US|accessdate=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2016 speech, Trump responded to concerns regarding a potential [[trade war]] with China: "We're losing $500 billion in trade with China. Who the hell cares if there's a trade war?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/20/trump-who-the-hell-cares-if-theres-a-trade-war/|title=Trump: 'Who the hell cares if there's a trade war?'|accessdate=May 21, 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ateker''', or '''ŋaTekerin''', is a common name for the closely related [[Jie (Uganda)|Jie]], [[Karamojong people|Karamojong]], [[Turkana people|Turkana]], [[Toposa people|Toposa]], [[Nyangatom people|Nyangatom]] and [[Teso people|Teso]] peoples and their languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Skpj197tU0oC&amp;pg=PA410|title=The State of the World's Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|last=Rischkowsky|first=Barbara|last2=Pilling|first2=Dafydd|date=2007|publisher=Food &amp; Agriculture Org.|year=|isbn=9789251057629|location=|pages=410|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ethnic groups inhabit an area across [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]].

House|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=xxi|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Teso'' have been used among ethnographers, while the term [[Teso-Turkana languages|Teso-Turkana]] is sometimes used for the languages, which are of [[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern Nilotic]] stock. ''Ateker'' means 'clan' or 'tribe' in the [[Teso language]]. In the [[Lango language (Uganda)|Lango language]], the word for clan is ''atekere''.

In the [[Turkana language]], ''Ateker'' means a distinct group with related customs, laws and lifestyle and who share a common ancestry. Members of one ''Ateker'' have a common character of mutual respect for each other in their diversity. Each member group of ''Ateker'' occupies its own territory and exercises authority over its own land and people independent of each other. 

The word ''Ateker'' is a generic term for "related peoples" or "relatives" (the term also refers to clan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UYu4AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=ateker+people&amp;dq=ateker+people&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDw_Lj48XUAhUlD8AKHQ4zDKUQ6AEINzAD|title=The Iteso during the asonya|last=Webster|first=James Bertin|date=1973|publisher=East African Pub. House|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=58|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the root ''ker'', which has two root meanings: fear and respect. Ateker, in its true sense, is a union of free people with mutual recognition and respect for each other. In the context of ethnic identity and nationhood, the Turkana language classifies different people with common characteristics as belonging to distinct ''ateker''. The [[Maa languages|Maa]] people belong to ''Ateker a Ngi Maasa [[Maasai people|Maasai]]'' and so on. The Turkana and the Karamojong and related people belong to one ''Ateker''.

==Common characteristics==
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=June 2017}}

=== Language ===
Member of one Ateker speak one language or distinct languages which developed from one common language.

=== Laws and customs ===
Each Ateker has distinct laws and customs. The laws and customs of people of one Ateker are similar.

=== Lifestyle ===
Members of each Ateker live their lives in a similar lifestyle. Diversified groups within one Ateker usually have traces of laws and customs that can be traced to the original group.

=== Land ===
Land is one characteristic that helps in determining membership in an Ateker. Members of one Ateker usually occupy adjoining areas. Land adjudication forms the basis for laws and customs. In the Turkana Ateker, land is subdivided into regions or territorial sections, [[ŋiTela]]. Each [[Ekitela]] institutes its own common laws which are derived from the general laws of the whole nation or kingdom.

=== Religion ===
Religious beliefs of one Ateker are similar. The supreme deity worshiped has one common name.

=== Common ancestry ===
Members of one Ateker have a common ancestral origin.

==Ateker laws==
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=June 2017}}

Among members of the Turkana-Karimojong Ateker, it is prohibited to kill members of the same Ateker. Killing members of the same Ateker is like killing one's own brother. Other laws govern marriage [[Akuuta]], divorce [[elakit]] or [[akilak]], grazing [[Achok]] or [[akitwar]] etc.

'''Australian permanent residents''' are [[Residency (domicile)|residents]] of [[Australia]] who hold a [[permanent residency]] [[visa (document)|visa]] but are not [[Australian nationality law|citizens of Australia]]. A holder of a permanent residency visa may remain in Australia indefinitely. A 5-year initial travel facility, which corresponds to the underlying migration program, is granted alongside the permanent residency. Until the travel facility expires, the visa holder may leave and re-enter Australia freely. After that period the visa holder needs to re-apply for the travel facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/887/how-the-visa-works.htm Skilled – Regional (Residence) visa (subclass 887)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent residency may be revoked at the discretion of the responsible Minister, for example in cases of criminal misconduct.

Permanent residents enjoy many of the rights and privileges of citizens, including access to free or subsidised legal and health services. They do not have the right to vote in [[Politics of Australia|federal]] or state/territory elections, unless they were registered to vote prior to 1984, but may vote in some local government elections. Permanent residents are not entitled to an [[Australian passport]].

Most permanent residents are eligible to become [[citizen]]s after a waiting period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Citi/&lt;/ref&gt; When the waiting period is complete, the process of sitting the citizenship test and attending the ceremony will add three to twelve months to gaining citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Citi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration programs==
{{main|Immigration to Australia}}
There are a number of programs under which a person may enter and obtain permanent residency in Australia, including:

* '''General Skilled Migration Program''' - mainly for skilled migrants, and has made available 129,250 visas for year 2012-2013
* '''Humanitarian Program''' - mainly for refugees seeking permanent residency, and has made available 13,750 visas for year 2012-2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family members can also be sponsored. An unlimited number of visas can be issued for partners (either married or ''de facto'') and dependent children. Visas for other family member types are subject to limited (known as "capping"); for example there are only 1000 visas available under the 'Parent' category, and as a consequence there is currently up to a twenty-year waiting period before undergoing consideration for these visas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Citizens of New Zealand==
Citizens of [[New Zealand]] are allowed to enter Australia to live and work indefinitely under the [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]], without applying for a visa but instead are automatically granted a [[Special Category Visa]] on arrival. Despite having the ability to reside with no time limit, the visa is still considered temporary. If they decided to become Australian citizens, then they need to apply for permanent residency visa first.

==Benefits==
Benefits of permanent resident status include:
* Few limitations on employment in Australia. Some job opportunities, largely federal governmental work, require citizenship as opposed to permanent residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/psa1999152/s22.html Public Service Act 1999, section 22, clause 6.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The right to apply for [[Australian nationality law|Australian citizenship]] after fulfilling some criteria.
* For permanent residents accepted under the humanitarian program and enrolled in a Commonwealth supported place, the right to defer payment of their student contribution under the HECS-HELP scheme.&lt;ref&gt;http://studyassist.gov.au/sites/studyassist/helppayingmyfees/hecs-help/pages/hecs-help-welcome&lt;/ref&gt;
* The right to sponsor relatives for permanent residence, subject to fulfilling residence criteria and assurance of support requirements.
* Children born ''inside'' Australia will be Australian citizens by birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Life/Chil]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The right to access medical and social security benefits, though there is a 2-year waiting period for some benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* The right to travel to New Zealand without applying for a New Zealand visa. (This right is granted by the [[New Zealand government]].)
* Unrestricted rights to live, work and study in New Zealand. (This right is granted by the New Zealand government.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://glossary.immigration.govt.nz/australiancitizensandresidents.htm Australian citizens and permanent residents - New Zealand Immigration Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5126">The '''British Show Pony Society''' (BSPS), formed in the autumn of 1949, is an organisation which oversees affiliated [[Riding Pony|show pony]], [[Show hunter (British)|hunter pony]] and [[Show hunter (British)|working hunter pony]] competitions for children's ponies in the [[United Kingdom]].  The Society offers three scholarships each year to help young riders develop their skills, and a number of recognition awards are also made. Owners, trainers and riders of ponies entered into BSPS championship shows must all be members of the society before the date of the show in which the pony qualified (though if they have never been BSPS members before, they may become members within seven days of the qualifying show), and all ponies shown at BSPS Championship shows must be registered with the society (though for animals never registered before, registration is allowed to take place within seven days after a pony has qualified at a qualifying show).  Heritage [[Mountain and moorland pony breeds|Mountain and Moorland]] ponies must also be registered with their own breed society.

==Organisation==
The country is divided into 17 areas, plus Scotland and Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsps.com/bsps-areas|title=Your Local BSPS Area|publisher=BSPS|accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and members join the appropriate area for where they live. Members earn points by competing at [[Horse show|shows]] in their area. Each area is run under a franchise from the BSPS, and is responsible for its own funding, from which it has to cover organisation of all BSPS events within its own area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsps.com/faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=BSPS|accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the BSPS united with 14 other British showing societies to create the Showing Council, an organization to represent the societies with the [[British Equestrian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/showing-world-gets-one-voice/|title=Showing World Gets One Voice|publisher=Horse &amp; Hound|date=March 14, 2013|accessdate=2013-12-02|author=Spinner, Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The showing of horses and ponies is widespread around the UK. The BSPS offers a large range of classes for the affiliated show rider or horse.  Around 500 shows each year are run by the BSPS areas, with showing divided into the summer season (April to August) and the winter season (October to March) which consists of competitions mainly aimed at novice ponies, with each season having its own championships. The summer season championships are usually held in August, and the winter season championships in April.

=== Rules ===
Ponies must be four years of age or over (age taken from 1 January of the year in which it was born), and riders must be a minimum of three years of age.  Each separate class has its own entry requirements for age and height of pony, and for age of rider.

Stallions may not be shown in any class other than the Heritage Mountain and Moorland, part-bred Arab, and Anglo-Arab classes.  Mares who have foaled in the current year may not be shown in any class at all.

=== Show Tack, Turnout and Clothing ===
Novice ponies and ponies for young children must be shown in simple [[snaffle bit|snaffle]] bridles, and non-novice working hunter and heritage ponies for older children may be shown in any suitable bridle, though a [[double bridle]] or a [[pelham bit]] is most often used.  A Rugby pelham, which, with its separate loose rings imitating the double bridle, is preferred by many as it removes the necessity for a pony to have two bits in its mouth. In the working hunter and non-jumping hunter pony classes it is considered more 'correct' for ponies to be shown in plain leather 'hunt type' bridles, while fancy browbands are used in children's riding pony classes.

The correct dress for riders includes a hat which meets the current approved safety standards, riding jacket (tweed is considered the appropriate jacket for showing Heritage Mountain and Moorland ponies and hunter ponies, with a dark showing jacket for children's riding ponies), shirt and tie or stock, and breeches with long boots or jodhpurs with jodhpur boots.

All ponies apart from the Heritage Mountain and Moorland ponies must have their manes plaited, with tails either plaited or neatly pulled.

==Qualifications and examinations==

The BSPS, in conjunction with the [[British Horse Society]], run a number of examinations each year in which people can qualify to become a Show Groom, an  Assistant Trainer, or an Accredited Trainer. The society also has an "Accredited Yard" scheme.
It also has qualifiers for RIHS and HOYS &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsps.com/accredited-trainers-grooms|title=BSPS Accredited Trainers, Assistant Trainers &amp; Show Grooms|publisher=BSPS|accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Capital City Club''' is a [[gentlemen's club|private social club]] located in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Chartered on May 21, 1883, it is one of the oldest private clubs in the [[Southeastern United States|South]].&lt;ref name="jbbook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Capital City Club: The First One Hundred Years, 1883-1983 | last=Bryant | first=James C | publisher=Capital City Club | year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to its charter, the purpose of the club is "to promote the pleasure, kind feeling and general culture of its members."&lt;ref name="jbbook" /&gt; Harry C. Stockdell was the club's first president.  He was succeeded in 1884 by [[Robert J. Lowry]]; and in 1885 [[Livingston Mims]] began the longest term as president, serving, with a two-year interruption, from 1886 through 1906.  Subsequent presidents have all served two years or less.

The first club house was located at 43 Walton Street.&lt;ref name="hj"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.capitalcityclub.hospitalityjobs.hcareers.com/ | publisher=hcareers | title=Club History | accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1884, the club moved to a new establishment at 114 [[Peachtree Street]].&lt;ref name="hj" /&gt; The Club presently operates three facilities for the use of its members, the oldest of which, the [[downtown Atlanta]] club building on John Portman Blvd., was dedicated on December 16, 1911. [[Herbert Barker (golfer)|Herbert Barker]] was the original architect of the golf course, which was completed in 1911.&lt;ref name="Courses built"&gt;{{cite web|title=Herbert Barker – Courses Built|url=http://www.worldgolf.com/golf-architects/herbert-barker.html|website=www.worldgolf.com|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Capital City Country Club, located in [[Brookhaven (Atlanta)|Brookhaven]], was leased in 1913 and purchased in 1915. At that time the [[golf course]] was increased from nine to eighteen holes. The present [[country club]] building was erected in 1928. In the autumn of 2002 an additional club facility, the Crabapple Golf Club, was completed on {{convert|600|acre|km2}} in the northern portion of [[Fulton County, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.capitalcityclub.org | title=Capital City Club | accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable individuals, including several [[presidents of the United States]] and [[Royal family|royalty]] from other nations, have been guests at the Capital City Club.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Atlanta Historic Resources Workbook'' by the Atlanta Urban Design Commission, September 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The downtown Atlanta Capital City Club was designed by [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts-trained]] architect [[Donn Barber]] in "the dignified and rather severe mode that characterizes prestigious [[New York City]] clubs such as the [[Colony Club]] ([[McKim, Mead &amp; White]], 1906)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''AIA Guide to the Architecture of Atlanta'': University of Georgia Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgian Revival]] in its textures and motifs, the building was originally four-stories with a fifth floor being added above the [[dentil]]ed cornice later in its history.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Their Capital City Country Club (1928) designed by Burge and Stevens, survives in [[Historic Brookhaven]] and "presents a picturesque, rambling, manorial image." "Tall chimneys, the cylindrical stair tower with [its] conical roof", and "[its] obliquely projecting gabled wings" create an "irregular silhouette of French provincial forms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-566 "Burge and Stevens", ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''caste system in [[Kerala]]''' differed from that found in the rest of India. While the [[Indian caste system]] generally modelled the four-fold division of society into [[Brahmin]]s, [[Kshatriya]]s, [[Vaishya]]s and [[Shudra]]s, in Kerala the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins formed the priestly class and only rarely recognised anyone else as being other than Shudra or [[Untouchability|untouchables]] outside the caste system entirely. Thus, the Kerala caste system was ritualised but it was not the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'' model found elsewhere.
Even inside Kerala, North Kerala castes are different from South Kerala. Until recent past, they did not follow marriage alliances sighting the differences. 
Kerala hindu upper castes are basically dominated by a multi caste groups collectively called as "Nairs".
Keralas caste system was more of a feudelistic set up, than a "Varna" system. Unlike the other part of India Nambuthiris and their spill out clans "Ambalavasis and Samamntha Nairs" held the vast majority of the lands sometimes even exceeding the kings.

Also, Kerala had one of the highest migration of different cultures at different times in history, due to its geographical connectivity. The migrants include, Babilonians, Arabians, Jews, later different Europians, Srilankans, Budhists monks, Jains and many more. The native Keralites are Adivasis, Pulayan, Parayan, Malayan etc. Infact these castes have their own caste systems and some of them consideres themself superior to all castes of Hindus. Eg: Kurichiar

==History==
A theory presented by Pullapilly and also by Rene Barendse, who {{as of|2012|lc=yes}} is a Fellow of the [[International Institute for Asian Studies]], claims that the caste system established by Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala was in accordance with the will of [[Parasurama]], an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]]{{clarify|date=April 2018}}.The Nambudiris had control of 64 villages and asserted that they had powers given to them by the gods, so much so that they considered even other Brahmin groups to be outside the caste hierarchy. Both writers consider this to be the traditional Nambudiri myth of origin.&lt;ref name=Pullapilly1976pp26-30&gt;Pullapilly (1976), pp. 26–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barendse2009p640&gt;Barendse (2009), p. 640.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nambudiri Brahmins were at the top of the ritual caste hierarchy, outranking even the kings. Anyone who was not a Nambudiri was treated by them as an untouchable.&lt;ref name="SchneiderGoughp306"&gt;Gough (1961), p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late nineteenth century, the caste system of Kerala had evolved to be the most complex to be found anywhere in India,&lt;ref name="Nossiter1982pp25-27"/&gt; and the exploitation of it had become considerable. Barendse explains this development: {{quote|...&amp;nbsp;it turned to gross unrequited exploitation only in the nineteenth century when the British colonial pacification removed the threat of the peasant harvests being ravaged by armies or robbers and their huts being burned to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Barendse (2009), p. 643.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By this time there were over 500 groups represented in an elaborate structure of relationships and the concept of ritual pollution extended not merely to untouchability but even further, to un-approachability and even un-seeability. The system was gradually reformed to some degree, with one of those reformers, [[Swami Vivekananda]], having observed that it represented a "mad house" of castes. The usual four-tier Hindu caste system, involving the ''varnas'' of Brahmin (priest), Kshatriya (warrior), Vaishya (business person, involved in trading, entrepreneurship and finance) and Shudra (service person), did not exist. Kshatriyas and vaishyas were rare.kshatriya castes such as Varma and vaishya castes as such a vaniyan,vanika,vanika vaishya,arya vaishya constituted less than 2% of the total population&lt;ref name="Kerala goverment data of caste population in kerala"&gt;| Kerala government data of caste population in which hindhu vaishya castes treated separately which constitute less than 2% of population|[[Demographics of Kerala]] &lt;/ref&gt;.
The roles left empty by the absence of these two ritual ranks were taken to some extent by a few Nairs and by Syrian Christians, respectively.&lt;ref name="Nossiter1982pp25-27"&gt;Nossiter (1982), pp.25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of amelioration of caste distinctions by various social reform movements were overtaken by the events of 1947. With [[Partition of India|independence]] from Britain came the [[Indian constitution]], and Article 15 of that document outlawed discrimination on the grounds of caste and race.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Myron Weiner]] has said that the ideological basis for caste "...&amp;nbsp;may be (almost, but not quite) moribund"&lt;ref name=Weiner2001p195&gt;Weiner (2001), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; and that: {{quote|no political parties, and no political leaders, no intellectuals support the idea that caste is part of a natural moral order based on hierarchy,&amp;nbsp;... that caste is occupationally linked and hereditary, that each caste (''jati'') embodies its own code of conduct (''dharma''), and that low-caste membership is the consequence of transgressions in one's previous life.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner (2001), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Weiner points out that despite the ideological demise: {{quote|...&amp;nbsp;as a lived-in social reality it is very much alive. The demise of orthodoxy, right beliefs, has not meant the demise of orthopraxy, right practice. Caste remains endogamous. Lower castes, especially members of scheduled castes, remain badly treated by those of higher castes. But the gap between beliefs and practices is the source of tension and change. The lower castes no longer accept their position in the social hierarchy, and no longer assume that their lower economic status and the lack of respect from members of the higher castes are a "given" in their social existence. But the movement for change is not a struggle to end caste; it is to use caste as an instrument for social change. Caste is not disappearing, nor is "casteism" - the political use of caste&amp;nbsp;— for what is emerging in India is a social and political system which institutionalizes and transforms but does not abolish caste.&lt;ref name=Weiner2001p195/&gt;}}

Although distinctions between the various communities are outlawed, the Indian governments&amp;nbsp;– both at national and at regional level&amp;nbsp;– do still recognise them, but this recognition is for the purpose of [[positive discrimination]]. Throughout post-independence India, including in Kerala, there exists a framework of [[Reservation in India|reservation]] which is fluid in nature and attempts to recognise the socio-economic disparities between various castes. Depending both on local circumstances and on the changing modern socio-economic environment, castes are classified as [[Forward caste|Forward Classes]] (or ''General''), [[Other backward caste|Other Backward Classes]], [[Scheduled castes|Scheduled Castes]], and the [[Scheduled tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. These classifications determine what&amp;nbsp;- if any&amp;nbsp;- assistance a caste community receives in any given area. Formal classification lists are compiled for the latter three groups; any community which is not listed in any of those categories is, by default, a Forward Class.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Writing in the context of violence against Dalits elsewhere in India, ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'' magazine said in 2006 that: {{quote|Successive governments have brought in legislation and programmes to protect the rights of Dalit communities. The safeguards enshrined in the Constitution stipulate that governments should take special care to advance the educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes, that untouchability is unacceptable and that all Dalit communities should have unrestricted entry in Hindu temples and other religious institutions. There are political safeguards in the form of reserved seats in State legislatures and in Parliament&amp;nbsp;... But prejudices die hard.&lt;ref&gt;Viswanathanin &amp; Shramakrishnan (2006), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, ''Frontline'' goes on to note that the situation in Kerala now, is not as severe, to the extent that those seeking to research: {{quote|...&amp;nbsp;continuing inequality and deprivation among traditionally disadvantaged groups in Kerala do not include Dalits any longer in their list of communities that still represent "distinct pockets of deprivation". The list includes only the traditional coastal fishing communities, the S.T.s [Scheduled Tribes] of North Kerala, and the new underclass of Tamil migrant workers&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Krishnakumar (2006), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Untouchables==
The Nambudiris had varying rules regarding the degrees of ritual pollution while interacting with people of different castes, which also included other Brahmins- such as Iyers, whose touch required a Nambudiri to bathe before resuming rituals.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.namboothiri.com/articles/sudham.htm http://www.namboothiri.com/articles/sudham.htm] &lt;/ref&gt; In a similar manner, most castes practised the principles of untouchability in their relationship with the other regional castes.&lt;ref name=Jeffrey1976pp9-10&gt;Jeffrey (1976), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Untouchability in Kerala is not restricted to Hindus, and George Mathew says that, "Technically, the Christians were outside [the] caste hierarchy, but in practice a system of inclusion and exclusion was developed&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Mathew (1989), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Christians, the established [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christians]] also practised the rules of untouchability. In the colonial period, many lower castes were converted to Christians by the European Missionaries, but the new converts were not allowed to join the Syrian Christian community and they continued to be considered as untouchables even by the Syrian Christians. Syrian Christians derive status within the caste system from the tradition that they were elites, who were [[evangelism|evangelised]] by [[Thomas the Apostle]].&lt;ref name="Fuller1976p55"&gt;Fuller (1976), pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuller, C.J 1977 pp. 528-529"&gt;Fuller, C.J. "Indian Christians: Pollution and Origins." ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]''. New Series, Vol. 12, No. 3/4.

Media House Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; Rajendra Prasad, an Indian historian, said that the Syrian Christians took ritual baths after physical contact with lower castes .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prasad |first=Rajendra |title=A Historical Developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals |volume=12 |publisher=Concept Publishing |isbn=978-8-18069-595-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1gtxVmUr1ygC&amp;pg=PA484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of untouchability were severe to begin with, and they were very strictly enforced by the time of the arrival of the [[Dutch East India Company]] in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=Barendse2009p640/&gt; [[Robin Jeffrey]], who is a professor specialising in the modern history and politics of India, quotes the wife of a Christian missionary, who wrote in 1860 that: {{quote|...&amp;nbsp;a Nair can approach but not touch a Namboodiri Brahmin: a Chovan [Ezhava] must remain thirty-six paces off, and a Pulayan slave ninety-six steps distant. A Chovan must remain twelve steps away from a Nair, and a Pulayan sixty-six steps off, and a Parayan some distance farther still. Pulayans and Parayars, who are the lowest of all, can approach but not touch, much less may they eat with each other.&lt;ref name=Jeffrey1976pp9-10/&gt;}}

Nonetheless, higher ranked communities did have some social responsibility for those perceived to be their inferiors: for example, they could demand forced labour but had to provide food for such labourers, and they had a responsibilities in times of famine to provide their tenants both with food and with the seeds to grow it. There were also responsibilities to protect such people from the dangers of attack and other threats to their livelihood, and so it has been described by Barendse as "an intricate dialectic of rights and duties".&lt;ref&gt;Barendse (2009), pp. 641-642.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sambandam==
{{Main|Sambandam}}
Sambandham or &lt;i&gt;sambandham&lt;/i&gt; (literally "relationship") was a marital system primarily followed by the [[Nair]] and [[Ambalavasi]] castes in the state of Kerala. All of these were matrilineal communities. The hypergamous institution of sambandam was involved in the establishment of and competition for status among these higher caste groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42|title=The Nayars today|last=1949-|first=Fuller, C.

==Demographics==
Around 2003, the Government of Kerala recognised 53 Scheduled Castes, 35 Scheduled Tribes and 80 Other Backwards Classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Official website of Kerala government |url=http://www.keralapsc.org/scstobc.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215234049/http://www.keralapsc.org/scstobc.htm |archivedate=2008-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 [[Census of India]] recognised 68 Scheduled Castes, who comprised 9.8% of the population.

&lt;/ref&gt; The Census recognised 35 Scheduled Tribes, comprising 1.14% of the population and with 93.7% being Hindus.

'''Central Public Library''' ({{lang-bn|কেন্দ্রীয় গণগ্রন্থাগার}}) of Bangladesh (between 1996 and 2007 it was named '''[[Sufia Kamal|Begum Sufia Kamal]] National Public Library''') is the largest public library in Bangladesh. It also houses the Public Library Department which, with 68 public libraries including the Central Public Library in its jurisdiction, is managed by the Directorate of Public Libraries under the Ministry of Cultural Affairs

The auditorium ([[Shawkat Osman]] Auditorium) of the library is a major venue for cultural events in Dhaka, including the International Short and Independent Film Festival. It also houses the Library Training Institute funded and managed by the [[Library Association of Bangladesh]] (LAB). It also has a [[reprography]] service, in-house [[bindery]] and conservation section.

==History==
The foundation stone for Dhaka Central Public Library was laid in 1954 with the Registrar of [[Dhaka University]] as part-time Librarian.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, J. Stephen (1979), ''Bangladesh public library survey final report'', vol. 1, p. 49, Library Development Consultants, London&lt;/ref&gt; Designated to be the centre for the public library system in the then [[East Pakistan]] on the basis of the recommendations made by Australian Library consultant Mr. L C Key in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Mannan, S.M.(1990), ''Library professional in Bangladesh: A study of their social background'', The  Dhaka University Studies, Part-A, 47(2), p. 114, Dhaka University, Dhaka&lt;/ref&gt; it was opened to the public on 22 March 1958 with a stock of 10,040 books. In 1978 the library moved to its building near the [[Shahbag|Shahbag Intersection]] from its original building designed by pioneering Bangladeshi architect [[Mazharul Islam]], which went on to house the Dhaka University Central Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Farhan |first1=Kazi Ahmed |last2=Ahmed |first2=Amanat |date=19 November 2006 |title=Stretching the horizon of knowledge |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2006/11/03/feature_knowledge.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of the Public Libraries was established with Bangladesh Central Public Library as its headquarters in 1984. Between 1980 and 1985 [[UNESCO]] provided nearly 9.9&amp;nbsp;million [[Bangladeshi taka]] to develop the library.

==Collection==
As of March 2007, the Library had 119,750 books in its collection, including old and rare books with historical value, along with a small valuable collection of 40 to 50 manuscripts titles for research and reference services. Books in the collection are mostly in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and English, as well as other languages including [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. As a depository library, it deposits all Bangladeshi publications under the [[Copyright Act (Bangladesh)|Copyright]]. The Library receives most of the Bangladeshi daily newspapers and periodicals. It also has a special collection of juvenile material and is providing separate reading facilities for children. The [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC) system with minor modifications is used to organise library materials.

==Library hours==
The library remains open from 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on all days except Fridays and national holidays. On 26 July 2003 started 24 hours reader service, which ceased on 1 March 2004 since drug abusers were taking opportunity of those hours.&lt;ref name="stopped"&gt;{{cite news |title=Round the clock reading facility at Central Public Library stopped |url=http://www.theindependent-bd.com/hotnews.php?nid=1966 |newspaper=The Independent |location=Dhaka |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928155741/http://www.theindependent-bd.com/hotnews.php?nid=1966 |archive-date=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district and branch libraries managed by the [[Department of the Public Libraries]] remain open from 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on all days except Fridays and government holidays. Lending facilities were introduced in 1994. As of 2004, the average number of readers was about 2,500 a day.&lt;ref name="stopped"/&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Concepts}}
There exists a diversity of views on [[prostitution]]. Many of these positions can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive  of prostitution and [[sex work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O’Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14–16 |isbn=978-0-7456-1204-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Red Light District.jpg|thumb|The Red Light district in Amsterdam]]

Anti-prostitution feminists hold that prostitution is a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men.

Pro-prostitution feminists hold that prostitution and other forms of [[sex work]] can be valid choices for women and men who choose to engage in it. In this view, prostitution must be differentiated from [[forced prostitution]], and feminists should support [[sex workers' rights|sex worker activism]] against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system.

The disagreement between these two feminist stances has proven particularly contentious, and may be comparable to the [[feminist sex wars]] (acrimonious debates on sex issues) of the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=Priscilla |year=1997 |chapter=Feminism, Sex Workers and Human Rights |editor-last=Nagle |editor-first=Jill |title=Whores and Other Feminists |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |pages=83–90 |isbn=978-0-415-91821-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framing the debate ==

Newman and White in Women, Politics and Public Policy argue that [[feminist]] perspectives on [[prostitution]] agree on three main points: “First, they condemn the current legal policy enforcing [[criminal]] sanctions against women who offer sex in exchange for money. Second, they agree that authentic consent is the [[sine qua non]] of legitimate sex, whether in commercial or non-commercial form. Third, all feminists recognize that commercial sex workers are subject to economic coercion and are often victims of violence, and that little is done to address these problems.”&lt;ref name=NewmanWhite-2012&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman and White |title=Women Power and Public Policy |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195432497}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|247}}

They go on to identify three main feminist views on the issue of prostitution. The sex work perspective, the abolitionist perspective and the outlaw perspective. The sex work perspective maintains that prostitution is a legitimate form of work for women faced with the option of other bad jobs, therefore women ought to have the right to work in the sex trade free of prosecution or the fear of it. The sex work perspective also argues that governments should eliminate laws that criminalize voluntary prostitution. This, the sex work perspective asserts, will allow prostitution to be regulated by governments and business codes, protect sex trade workers, and improve the ability to prosecute people who hurt them. The Abolitionist perspective holds that governments should work towards the elimination of prostitution. The Outlaw Perspective views work in the sex trade as a “stepping stone to a better career or an expression of sexual freedom”.&lt;ref name=NewmanWhite-2012 /&gt;{{rp|248}}

==Arguments against prostitution==
A proportion of feminists are strongly opposed to prostitution,  as they see the practice as a form of violence against women, which should not be tolerated by society. Feminists who hold such views on prostitution include [[Kathleen Barry]], [[Melissa Farley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/faq/000008.html Prostitution: Factsheet on Human Rights Violations].

===Coercion and poverty===
{{See also|Survival sex}}
These feminists do argue that, in most cases, prostitution is not a conscious and calculated choice. They say that most women who become prostitutes do so because they were forced or coerced by a pimp or by human trafficking, or, when it is an independent decision, it is generally the result of extreme poverty and lack of opportunity, or of serious underlying problems, such as drug addiction, past trauma (such as child sexual abuse) and other unfortunate circumstances.

These feminists point out that women from the lowest socioeconomic classes—impoverished women, women with a low level of education, women from the most disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities—are overrepresented in prostitution all over the world. "If prostitution is a free choice, why are the women with the fewest choices the ones most often found doing it?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N48y66ArkIcC&amp;pg=PA159 |title=Women's Lives, Men's Laws |author=MacKinnon, Catharine A. |isbn=9780674024069 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large percentage of prostitutes polled in one study of 475 people involved in prostitution reported that they were in a difficult period of their lives and most wanted to leave the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Farley, Melissa. (April/2/2000) [http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/faq/000008.html Prostitution: Factsheet on Human Rights Violations]. Prostitution Research &amp; Education. Retrieved on 2009-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;
Catharine MacKinnon argues that "In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. It acts like physical force does in rape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpbn.org/program/intelligence-squared/episode/its-wrong-pay-sex |title=It's Wrong to Pay for Sex |date=5 August 2009 |website= |publisher=Connecticut Public Radio |accessdate=8 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625230257/http://www.cpbn.org/program/intelligence-squared/episode/its-wrong-pay-sex |archivedate=25 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anti-prostitution scholars hold that true consent in prostitution is not possible. Barbara Sullivan says, "In the academic literature on prostitution there are very few authors who argue that valid consent to prostitution is possible. Most suggest that consent to prostitution is impossible or at least unlikely.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/sullivan.rtf |title=Rethinking Prostitution and 'Consent' |author=SULLIVAN, Barbara |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914105702/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/sullivan.rtf |archivedate=2009-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "(...) most authors suggest that consent to prostitution is deeply problematic if not impossible (...) most authors have argued that consent to prostitution is impossible. For radical feminists this is because prostitution is always a coercive sexual practice. Others simply suggest that economic coercion makes the sexual consent of sex workers highly problematic if not impossible...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSjEnDrb8QcC&amp;pg=PA127 |title=Making sense of sexual consent |author1=De Mark Cowling |author2= Paul Reynolds |accessdate=2010-05-09|isbn=9780754636878 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, abolitionists believe no person can be said to truly consent to their own oppression and no people should have the right to consent to the oppression of others.  In the words of [[Kathleen Barry]], consent is not a “good divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and consent to violation is a fact of oppression.  Oppression cannot effectively be gauged according to the degree of “consent,” since even in slavery there was some consent, if consent is defined as inability to see any alternative.&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, K "The Prostitution of Sexuality: The Global Exploitation of Women" New York: NYU Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term effects on the prostitutes===
Anti-prostitution feminists argue that prostitution is a practice which leads to serious negative long-term effects for the prostitutes, such as trauma, stress, depression, anxiety, self-medication through alcohol and drug use, eating disorders and a greater risk for self-harm and suicide, as they say prostitution is an exploitative practice, which involves a woman who has sex with customers to whom she is not attracted, and which also routinely exposes the women to psychological, physical and sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ruhama.ie/easyedit/files/Ruhama-NextStep-6.pdf|title=Factors affecting prostitution – Damage and survival mechanisms|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2010-05-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410140946/http://www.ruhama.ie/easyedit/files/Ruhama-NextStep-6.pdf|archivedate=2011-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Joe.

[[Andrea Dworkin]] stated her opinions as: "Prostitution in and of itself is an abuse of a woman's body. Those of us who say this are accused of being simple-minded. But prostitution is very simple. (…) In prostitution, no woman stays whole. It is impossible to use a human body in the way women's bodies are used in prostitution and to have a whole human being at the end of it, or in the middle of it, or close to the beginning of it. It's impossible. And no woman gets whole again later, after.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/MichLawJourI.html |title=Prostitution and Male Supremacy (1 of 2) |publisher=Nostatusquo.com |date=1992-10-31 |author=Andrea Dworkin |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male dominance over women===
Anti-prostitution feminists are extremely critical of [[sex-positive]] perspectives, wherein prostitution by choice is said to be part of the sexual liberation of women, that it can be empowering for women, etc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Some feminists who oppose prostitution agree that sexual liberation for women outside of prostitution is important in the fight for [[gender equality]], but they say it is crucial that society does not replace one patriarchal view on female sexuality - e.g., that women should not have sex outside marriage/a relationship and that casual sex is shameful for a woman, etc. - with another similarly oppressive and patriarchal view - acceptance of prostitution, a sexual practice which is based on a highly patriarchal construct of sexuality: that the sexual pleasure of a woman is irrelevant, that her only role during sex is to submit to the man’s sexual demands and to do what he tells her, that sex should be controlled by the man and that the woman’s response and satisfaction are irrelevant. These feminists argue that sexual liberation for women cannot be achieved as long as we normalize unequal sexual practices where a man dominates a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catwap.wordpress.com/resources/speeches-papers/sex-from-human-intimacy-to-sexual-labor-or-is-prostitution-a-human-right/ |title=SEX: From human intimacy to "sexual labor" or Is prostitution a human right? |author=Cecilia Hofmann |publisher=CATW-Asia Pacific |date = August 1997|accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client. These feminists believe that many clients use the services of prostitutes because they enjoy the "power trip" they derive from the act and the control they have over the woman during the sexual activity. Catharine MacKinnon argues that prostitution "isn't sex only, it’s you do what I say, sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intelligencesquaredus.org/wp-content/uploads/ItsWrongToPayForSex-042109.pdf |title=It's wrong to pay for sex |date=22 April 2009 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitution is seen by these feminists as the result of a patriarchal societal order which subordinates women to men and where the inequality between genders is present in all aspects of life. These feminists believe that prostitution is very harmful to society as it reinforces the idea that women are sex objects which exist for men's enjoyment, which can be "bought" and which can be "used" solely for men's sexual gratification. Anti-prostitution feminists argue that when a society accepts prostitution it sends the message that it is irrelevant how the woman feels during sex or what the consequences of sex will be for her, and that it is acceptable for a man to engage in sexual activity with a woman who does not enjoy it and who could be mentally and emotionally forcing herself in order to be able to cope; the normalization of such one sided sexual encounters might negatively affect the way men relate to women in general and might increase sexual violence against women.

These feminists see prostitution as a form of slavery, and say that, far from decreasing rape rates, prostitution leads to a sharp ''increase'' in sexual violence against women, by sending the message that it is acceptable for a man to treat a woman as a sexual instrument over which he has total control. Melissa Farley argues that Nevada's high rape rate is connected to legal prostitution because Nevada is the only US state which allows legal brothels and is ranked 4th out of the 50 U.S. states for sexual assault crimes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inner-star.org/sexualassaultprevention.html |title=Sexual Assault Prevention Program at ISPAN |publisher=Inner-star.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "Nevada's rape rate is higher than the U.S. average and way higher than the rape rate in California, New York and New Jersey. Why is this? Legal prostitution creates an atmosphere in this state in which women are not humans equal to them, are disrespected by men, and which then sets the stage of increased violence against women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2007/Sep-07-Fri-2007/news/16519321.html |title=Panel: Brothels aid sex trafficking |author=MARK WAITE |publisher=Pahrump Valley Times |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2010-05-09|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217174035/http://www.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2007/Sep-07-Fri-2007/news/16519321.html |archivedate = December 17, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A consequence and correlate of violence against women===
{{POV section|date=December 2016}}
{{See also|Forced prostitution}}
Some feminists, including many who identify as supporting the abolition of prostitution, see the selling of sex as a potential after effect of violence against women. Those who support this position cite studies of violence experienced by women in prostitution prior to entering prostitution. Most (60% to 70%) were sexually abused as children&lt;ref name="Silbert and Pines"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silbert | first1 = Mimi H. | last2 = Pines | first2 = Ayala M. | author-link = Mimi Silbert | title = Entrance into prostitution | journal = [[Youth &amp; Society]] | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–500 | doi = 10.1177/0044118X82013004005 | date = June 1982 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; 65% have been raped, most before the age of 15,&lt;ref name="Silbert"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Silbert | first1 = Mimi H. | last2 = Pines | first2 = Ayala M. | last3 = Lynch | first3 = Teri | author-link = Mimi Silbert | title = Sexual assault of prostitutes: phase one | publisher = Delancey Street Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health | location = Washington D.C. | series = Grant No. RO1-MH-32782-01 | year = 1980 | oclc = 45111118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that many young women and girls enter prostitution directly from state care, at least in England, Norway, Australia and Canada.&lt;ref name="Coy"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coy | first = Maddy | author-link = Maddy Coy | title = Young women, local authority care and selling sex: findings from research | journal = [[The British Journal of Social Work]] | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1408–1424 | doi = 10.1093/bjsw/bcm049 | date = October 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bcm049 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitution abolitionists also object to the high rates of violence against women in the sex industry. Studies of women in prostitution show an extremely high level of violence is perpetrated against women in prostitution.  Figures vary across studies.  One representative study showed 82% of respondents had been physically assaulted since entering prostitution, 55% of those by clients.  Additionally, 80% had been physically threatened while in prostitution, 83% of those with a weapon.  8% reported physical attacks by pimps and clients of a nature that resulted in serious injury, for example gunshot wounds and knife wounds.  68% reported having been raped since entering prostitution, 48% more than five times and 46% reporting rapes committed by clients.  Finally, 49% reported pornography was made of them while they were in prostitution and 32% had been upset by an attempt to make them do what clients had seen in pornography.&lt;ref name="Farley and Barkan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farley | first1 = Melissa | last2 = Kiremire | first2 = Merab | last3 = Baral | first3 = Isin | last4 = Sezgin | first4 = Ufuk | author-link1 = Melissa Farley | date = November 1998 | title = Prostitution in five countries: violence and post-traumatic stress disorder | journal = [[Feminism &amp; Psychology]] | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 405–426 | doi = 10.1177/0959353598084002 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.522.9029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear.  Many brothels have installed panic buttons because of the ongoing threat of violence indoors.

Beyond the individual instances of violence or the history of violence suffered by most women in prostitution, prostitution abolitionists see prostitution itself as a form of male violence against women and children.&lt;ref name="Farley and Barkan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AWAN"&gt;{{cite book | title = Aboriginal Women's Action Network Statement on Prostitution | publisher = Aboriginal Women's Action Network (AWAN) | url = http://prostitutionresearch.com/pub_author/aboriginal-womens-action-network-awan/ | year = 2007 }} [http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/aboriginal%20statement%20on%20legal%20prostitution.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raymond 10"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Raymond | first = Janice G. | author-link1 = Janice Raymond | title = Ten reasons for ''not'' legalizing prostitution and a legal response to the demand for prostitution | journal = [[Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment &amp; Trauma|Journal of Trauma Practice]] | volume = 2 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 315–332 | doi = 10.1300/J189v02n03_17 | date = January 2004 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This understanding is the major theoretical root of calls to decriminalize prostitution(mostly women), but continue to criminalize those who prostitute them, including clients, pimps, procurers and traffickers. Similarly, in other forms of violence against women, anti-violence feminists expect women who are battered, raped, incested, harassed and threatened will not be punished for the crimes committed against them, while the male perpetrators, mostly known to the victims, will suffer criminalization in accordance with the law.

Prostitution abolitionists also cite similarities between prostitution and violence against women. Farley, Lynne and Cotton (2005) argue the prostitution is most like battery because it similarly involves a pattern of coercive and [[controlling behaviour]] (by pimps, procurers and traffickers as well as clients) that results in the control of the women in prostitution.&lt;ref name="Lynne"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farley | first1 = Melissa | last2 = Lynne | first2 = Jacqueline | last3 = Cotton | first3 = Ann J. | author-link1 = Melissa Farley | title = Prostitution in Vancouver: violence and the colonization of First Nations women | journal = [[Transcultural Psychiatry]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–271 | date = June 2005 | doi = 10.1177/1363461505052667 | pmid = 16114585 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by Giobbe (1993) found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|enforced social isolation]], threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence.&lt;ref name="Giobbe"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Giobbe | first = Evelina | title = A comparison of pimps and batterers | journal = [[University of Michigan Law School#Publications|Michigan Journal of Gender and Law]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–35 | date = June 2005 | ref = harv }} [http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/An%20analysis%20of%20individual%2C%20institutional%2C%20and%20cultural%20pimping-Giobbe.pdf Pdf of pages 33-58.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some prostitutes argue prostitution has similarities to rape because it is a form of sexuality that is entirely controlled by the client, as rape is a form of sexuality in which the rapist controls the interaction, disregarding the desires, physical well-being or emotional pain of the victim.&lt;ref name="Not for Sale"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Whisnant | editor1-first = Rebecca | editor2-last = Stark | editor2-first = Christine | title = Not for sale: feminists resisting prostitution and pornography | publisher = Spinifex Press | location = North Melbourne, Victoria, Australia | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781876756499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The raced and classed nature of prostitution ===
Prostitution abolitionists adopt an [[intersectionality|intersectional]] approach to understanding the power relations involved in prostitution.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}}{{POV statement|date=April 2017}} That is, they see prostitution as compelled by multiple forms of [[Oppression|oppressive]] social power, not just sexism against women. Some analysts on human rights issues surrounding prostitution, such as [[Sigma Huda]] in her report for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, also adopt this approach:

:“The act of prostitution by definition joins together two forms of social power (sex and money) in one interaction.  In both realms (sexuality and economics) men hold substantial and systematic power over women.  In prostitution, these power disparities merge in an act which both assigns and reaffirms the dominant social status of men over the subordinated social status of women.”&lt;ref name="Huda"&gt;Huda, S "Report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights aspects of the victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, Sigma Huda" for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
:“The demand for commercial sex is often further grounded in social power disparities of race, nationality, caste and colour.”&lt;ref name="Huda"/&gt;

Abolitionists attribute prostitution to women's comparative lack of economic resources. Globalisation and neoliberalism have exacerbated already unequal economic relations, including by cutting back social spending in Northern and formerly socialist countries, and increasing the demand for cheap labour, including in prostitution, in both Southern and Northern countries.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Combined with sex discrimination in wages and job type, sexual harassment in the workplace, and an undue burden of caring for children, the elderly and the ill, women are at a significant economic disadvantage in the current economic structure.  Poverty is the single greatest “push” factor making women vulnerable to accepting prostitution as a means of subsistence.&lt;ref name="Raymond 10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Connor and Healy"&gt;O'Connor, M and Healy, G "The Links Between Prostitution and Sex Trafficking: A Briefing Handbook" Prepared for the Joint Project Coordinated by the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW) and the European Women’s Lobby (EWL) on Promoting Preventative Measures to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings for Sexual Exploitation: A Swedish and United States Governmental and Non-Governmental Organisation Partnership 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, racism shapes women's entry into prostitution, both because it makes women more vulnerable to prostitution and because clients demand racialized women in prostitution. Racism in education, economic and political systems affect the choices of women of colour.  Additionally, racist sexualisation, through pornography in particular, of Black and Asian women as over-sexed and submissive or otherwise available for prostitution contributes to the demand for specifically racialized women.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/racism/000015.html#more|title=Prostitution: Where Racism and Sexism Intersect|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massage parlours, strip clubs and other prostitution businesses are often located in poor and racialized neighbourhoods, encouraging clients to troll those neighbourhoods for women, making all women in those neighbourhoods vulnerable to prostitution-related harassment and women in those neighbourhoods more likely to accept their use in prostitution as normal.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;

Indigenous women around the world are particularly targeted for prostitution.  In Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, and Taiwan, studies have shown that indigenous women are at the bottom of the race and class hierarchy of prostitution, often subjected to the worst conditions, most violent demands and sold at the lowest price.&lt;ref name="Lynne"/&gt;  It is common for indigenous women to be over-represented in prostitution when compared with their total population.  This is as a result of the combined forces of colonialism, physical displacement from ancestral lands, destruction of indigenous social and cultural order, misogyny, globalization/neoliberalism, race discrimination and extremely high levels of violence perpetrated against them.&lt;ref name="Lynne"/&gt;  The Aboriginal Women's Action Network, an abolitionist organization in Canada, has specifically noted that because the prostitution of Aboriginal women results from and reinforces such extreme hatred of Aboriginal women, no regime of legalisation (which will expand the industry and entrap more women) can be safer for Aboriginal women.  Prostitution can only further harm Aboriginal women.&lt;ref name="AWAN"/&gt;

===Outlawing of buying sexual services===
{{See also|Prostitution law}}
In  1999, [[Sweden]] became the first country to make it illegal to pay for sex, but not to be a prostitute (the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute). Similar laws were passed in [[Norway]] (in 2009)&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806760.stm New Norway law bans buying of sex]. BBC News (2009-01-01).

During 2011, the newly elected government of [[Denmark]] began discussing the possibility of banning the buying of sexual services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nppr.se/2011/09/21/denmark-election-new-government-towards-new-prostitution-policy/ The Danish election: a new government – and towards a new prostitution regime?].

Carnal San Francisco. Retrieved on 2009-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws are a natural extension of the views of the feminists who oppose prostitution. These feminists reject the idea that prostitution can be reformed, and oppose any [[harm reduction]] approach. [[Trisha Baptie]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] former prostitute, who now opposes the industry, and lobbies for the outlawing of buying sexual services, wrote: "Harm reduction ? You can’t make prostitution "safer" ; prostitution is violence in itself. It is [[rape]], the money only appeases men’s guilt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Trisha Baptie |url=http://sisyphe.org/spip.php?article3290 |title="Sex worker" ? Never met one ! |publisher=Sisyphe.org |date=2009-04-26 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; " "One of the most “[[sex-positive]]” things you can do is make sure men cannot buy sex, because the buying of sex is violence against women and is a direct deterrent to women’s equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/article-232404/trisha-baptie-why-prostitution-worlds-oldest-oppression-must-be-stamped-out | title=Commentary: Why prostitution, the world's oldest oppression, must be stamped out &amp;#124; Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada |publisher=Straight.com |date=2009-06-12 |author=Trisha Baptie |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "

These feminists see prostitution as a form of [[violence against women]] and vehemently condemn the common pro-legalization argument that "prostitution has always existed and will never go away", arguing that other violent acts such as murder, rape and child sexual abuse have also always existed and will never be eradicated either, and that is not a reason to legalize them. These feminists argue that the idea of legalizing prostitution in order to control it and "make it a little better" and reduce harm is no different from the idea of legalizing domestic violence in order to control it and "make it a little better" and reduce harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nevadacoalition.org/factsheets/LegliznFactSheet091707c.pdf |title=Myths and Facts about Nevada Legal Prostitution |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pro-sex worker perspectives==

To directly counteract the view of prostitution as the oppression of women, some scholars and feminists have voiced their opinion in support of prostitution and other forms of sex-work. Support is based on ideas of economic empowerment, independence and autonomy of choice, comparisons to sexual role in marriage, and challenging outdated societal notions of the proper expression of women's sexuality.

=== Proponents and support groups ===

Activists and scholars who are proponents of the pro-sex work position include: [[Margo St. James]], [[Norma Jean Almodovar]],&lt;ref&gt;Norma Jean Almodovar, 2002, "For Their Own Good: The Results of the Prostitution Laws as Enforced by Cops, Politicians, and Judges", in Liberty for Women, W. McElroy (ed.), Chicago: Ivan R. Dee.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kamala Kempadoo]],&lt;ref&gt;Kamala Kempadoo, and Doezema, J., (eds.), 1998, Global Sex Workers: Rights, Resistance, and Redefinition, New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Laura María Agustín]], [[Annie Sprinkle]], [[Carol Leigh]] (also known as Scarlot Harlot), [[Carol Queen]] and [[Audacia Ray]].

To assist women not involved in traditional “woman’s work,” pro-sex work formed to create a helpful environment for sex workers.  Social activist groups like The Red Thread, founded in 1985, seek to educate the public, provide legal and medical assistance to sex workers, and help organize sex workers into groups in order to better protect themselves and to become advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Holly B. Fechner, Three Stories of Prostitution in the West: Prostitutes' Groups, Law and Feminist "Truth", 4 Colum. J. Gender &amp; L. 26, 33 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminists and groups such as The Red Thread, The International Committee for Prostitutes (ICPR) and COYOTE seek to ensure that sex work is seen as a valid choice that women may make without overtly oppressive forces.

=== Economic empowerment ===

One view is that sex work not only empowers women, but it provides women with greater opportunities for financial advancement.&lt;ref&gt;Lars O. Ericson, Charges against Prostitution: An Attempt at a Philosophical Assessment, 90 Ethics 335, 354 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;
The proponents of female empowerment through sex work are liberal feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Beran, Revisiting the Prostitution Debate: Uniting Liberal and Radical Feminism in Pursuit of Policy Reform, 30 Law &amp; Ineq. 19, 31 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminists view prostitution as the sale of sex solely for economic gain, and thus it cannot be differentiated from any other sale of goods. The selling of sex ultimately consists of a buyer and a seller trying to negotiate for the best deal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; Interfering in this sale of goods could not only be interfering with the rights of the buyer, but also of the seller. Women who have chosen to enter the field should not be looked down upon and should not have their choice considered to be lesser than another type of socially accepted employment. Liberal feminists argue that while prostitution and sex work may not be the ideal job for many women, it can provide a way of life and prosperity that would be otherwise unattainable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Sex work can be seen as a better alternative to working for minimum wage or working in a field that that society decided is “woman’s work.”

=== Self empowerment ===

To conclude that all sex workers partake in the industry because of oppression, past sexual abuse, and lack of opportunity, creates a critical division in feminism and equality. Assuming that all women who chose to partake in sex work are victims of oppression violates their ability to make an autonomous choice. The autonomy theory of feminism seeks to instill in women the right to “stand on their own, make their own decisions, and pursue their own notion of a life lived well.”&lt;ref&gt;Katherine T. Bartlett, Deborah Rhode, &amp; Joanna L. Grossman, Gender and Law, 599 (6th ed. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot be ignored that some women freely chose to become sex workers not because of oppression, but because of their love for sex and desire for power.
 
Sex work can also create a sense of independence for women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Rather than relying on a husband or a partner, sex work allows women to make choices completely free from pressure or influence. While women are socialized to hide their sexuality, sex workers are free to explore their sexuality and to openly choose their sexual partners.  Sex workers, whether they work on the streets or in hotels, have the freedom to accept or to reject clients. They are free to accept or to decline any sexual advance. This stands in direct opposition to the married housewife who does not have the sexual autonomy of the sex worker.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Ericson, Charges against Prostitution, 90 Ethics 335, 354 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas radical feminists consider sex workers to be victims of circumstances and false consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;Katherine T. Bartlett ET AL., Gender and Law, at 657.&lt;/ref&gt; the liberal feminists and women who chose to participate in sex work do not consider themselves to be victims of any sort. Instead, they consider their actions to be liberating and providing them with a sense of control.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Weitzer, Legalizing Prostitution: From Illicit Vice to Lawful Business, 7 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage analogy ===

Sex work and prostitution have often been compared to a marriage in which the man is the breadwinner, while the woman stays at home and cares for the family. There does not appear to be a distinction between the woman who has devoted her body to her husband in exchange for his promise to take care of her, and the sex worker who has chosen to sell sexual acts in exchange for payment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Radical feminists and others opposed to prostitution will state that marriage and monogamy cannot be compared to prostitution because a marriage is beyond a contract, and a marriage does not advocate for the dominance of the man over the woman.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Pateman, Prostitution: Charges Against Ericson, 93 Ethics 561, 562-63 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the difference goes beyond dominance but to choice. The true difference between the dependent spouse and the sex worker is that the independent sex worker does not belong to one man; in fact, she does not belong to anyone but herself.

=== Acceptance of women's sexuality ===

Liberal feminists argue that the patriarchal and moralistic view of sex as the ultimate expression of a woman’s love must be changed in order for society to truly understand the sexual nature of women.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine T. Bartlett ET AL., Gender and Law, at 658.&lt;/ref&gt; A pro sex worker stance is inextricably linked to the idea of women finally not being forced to view romantic sex as the only type of sex.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Notions of “proper womanhood and conventional sexuality”&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Weitzer, Legalizing Prostitution, at 7.&lt;/ref&gt; cannot be linked to a woman’s choice in one sexual partner or multiple, or a woman’s choice to engage in sexual intercourse in exchange for love or for money.  Proper woman is a term that has its definition rooted in socialization and not fact. Prostitution and sex work are about more than the female sexual experience. Sex work can provide female empowerment and instill “a sense of self worth, self-confidence, and self esteem.”  &lt;ref&gt;Id. at 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalization or decriminalization===
{{See also|Sex workers' rights}}

Feminists who support the legalization or decriminalization of prostitution argue that one of the significant flaws with the radical anti-prostitution feminist view is that a majority of its arguments are premised on the assumption that prostitution itself is inherently laced with sexism, classism and other unbalanced power relations. The institution of prostitution itself is seen by abolitionists as resting on these conditions and therefore they believe legalization or decriminalization will only lead to the reinforcement of these conditions. Pro-sex-work feminists argue that this assumption is flawed, and that while prostitution, as it currently exists in our society, can be misogynist or degrading in some manifestations, there is a grave danger in attributing these conditions to prostitution itself. They argue that targeting prostitution as a whole unduly focuses attention on this single institution in our society, rather than looking at society at large and the social institutions, laws and practices that lead to the subordination and oppression of women.&lt;ref name="Bromberg"&gt;{{cite web | title=Feminist Issues In Prostitution. | first=Sarah | last=Bromberg | url=http://www.feministissues.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Case for the Legalization of Prostitution: A Critical Analysis of Liberal versus Radical Feminist Views on Sex Work. | first=Sarah | last=Landau. | url= http://www.sarahlandau.com/2008/04/a-case-for-the-legalization-of.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much debate over the last few decades amongst feminists about how laws relating to prostitution should be reformed. Most liberal feminists who look at prostitution from a capitalist perspective support some form of either decriminalization or legalization.

Decriminalization is the removal of all penalties for prostitution itself and for all the activities necessary for prostitutes to do their work, such as advertising, communicating with clients, etc. It does not mean the reversal of ''all'' laws relating to prostitution, for example laws that exist against forcing someone into prostitution. For the purposes of decriminalization, Feminists for Free Expression defines the word “prostitution” to mean any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved; nonconsensual sex acts or sex acts perpetrated against minors are not prostitution, in their view. Instead they prefer the term "criminal sexual acts".&lt;ref name="ffeusapropam"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Feminists for Free Expression. | title=The Free Speech Pamphlet Series: Prostitution. | url=http://www.ffeusa.org/html/statements/statements_prostitution.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'legalization', on the other hand, is usually used in the context of prostitution to refer to the use of criminal laws to regulate prostitution by determining the legal conditions under which prostitutes can operate. Legalization can mean anything from rigid controls under a state-controlled system to merely defining the operation of a privatized sex industry. Legalization is often accompanied by strict criminal penalties for anyone who operates outside the legally defined framework.&lt;ref&gt;Defining Terms. From PRINCIPLES FOR MODEL SEX INDUSTRY LEGISLATION. Scarlet Alliance. http://www.bayswan.org/defining.html&lt;/ref&gt; With legalization there may be rules about where prostitution can take place (for example only in state licensed brothels), what prostitutes can do, mandatory registry/licensing and frequent mandatory health exams.&lt;ref&gt;Making Space for Working Women. Stella. http://www.chezstella.org/stella/?q=en/debate&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pro-sex-worker feminists support decriminalization and some support legalization, for different reasons. Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers. They argue that decriminalization is better for the workers than legalization and that both criminalization and heavily regulated legalization infringe on the workers' safety and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Decriminalization of Prostitution  to Reduce Sex Workers'  Vulnerability to HIV. | author=Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network. | url=http://www.aidslaw.ca/publications/interfaces/downloadFile.php?ref=657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many feminists who support sex workers favor decriminalization because it allows prostitutes to go into business for themselves and self-determination is a tenet of feminist politics.&lt;ref name="ffeusapropam" /&gt; They believe decriminalization fosters responsibility, empowerment, self-esteem and self-care, all important feminist values. The goal in decriminalizing sex work is that anyone doing any type of sex work would be treated the same way, with the same rights and responsibilities, as any other self-employed person.&lt;ref&gt;Legalization vs Decriminalization. Stella. http://www.chezstella.org/stella/?q=en/debate&lt;/ref&gt; Whether they support decriminalization or some form of legalization, pro-sex work feminists believe that the current laws that exist surrounding prostitution in many countries need to be changed and are harmful to the people who work in the industry.

==Other perspectives==
There are many feminists whose views on prostitution do not fit in either the anti-prostitution feminist or the sex-positive feminist viewpoints, and in some cases are critical of both. These feminist authors have criticized what they see as the unproductive and often bitter debate that characterizes the two-position analysis of prostitution. Such authors highlight that in allowing arguments about prostitution to be reduced to a stale analysis and theoretical debate, feminists are themselves contributing to the [[marginalization]] of prostitutes, simplifying the nature of the work they carry out and the personal circumstances that involve each individual.&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill, Maggie (2001) ''Prostitution and Feminism''. Polity Press: Cambridge pg 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist scholar [[Laurie Shrage]] has also criticized the haphazard nature of feminist views on prostitution. Shrage claims that in a determination to undermine patriarchy, pro-sex feminists have advocated a reckless and "[[Milton Friedman]] style" deregulation of laws surrounding prostitution, without considering the implications that this may have upon women involved in sex work, particularly given the nature of the sex trade, which is more likely to be plagued by exploitation and poor working conditions, concerns that must be of importance to any feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-415-90551-0| last = Shrage| first = Laurie| title = Moral dilemmas of feminism: prostitution, adultery, and abortion| year = 1994}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=UyxXzVGVxl0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p 83].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{US Constitution article series}}
The '''Fifth Amendment'''  ('''Amendment V''') to the [[United States Constitution]] is part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and, among other things, protects individuals from being compelled to be witnesses against themselves in criminal cases. "'''Pleading the Fifth'''" is thus a colloquial term for invoking the right that allows witnesses to decline to answer questions where the answers might incriminate them, and generally without having to suffer a penalty for asserting the right. This [[Privilege (evidence)|evidentiary privilege]] ensures that defendants cannot be compelled to become witnesses at their own trials. If, however, they choose to testify, they are not entitled to the right during cross-examination, where questions are relevant to their testimony on direct examination.&lt;ref&gt; Brown v United States 356 U.S. 148 (1958). https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/356/148.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Amendment requires that felonies be tried only upon [[indictment]] by a [[grand jury]]. Federal grand juries can force people to take the witness stand, but defendants in those proceedings have Fifth Amendment privileges until they choose to answer any question. To claim the privilege for failure to answer when being interviewed by police, the interviewee must have explicitly invoked the constitutional right when declining to answer questions.

The Amendment's [[Double Jeopardy Clause]] provides the right to be tried only once in federal court for the same offense. The Amendment also has a [[Due Process Clause]] (similar to the one in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]) as well as an implied [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection requirement]] (''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'', 1954). Finally, the Amendment requires that the power of [[eminent domain]] be coupled with "just compensation" for those whose property is taken.

==Text==
The amendment as proposed by Congress in 1789 reads as follows:
{{quote|No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.}}
{{wide image|Amendment_5.jpg|1999px|The hand-written copy of the proposed Bill of Rights, 1789, cropped to just show the text that would later be ratified as the Fifth Amendment}}

==Background before adoption==
[[File:Original 1792 version by Peale.jpg|thumb|Painting of James Madison by [[Charles Wilson Peale]], done in 1792.]]On June 8, 1789, Congressman [[James Madison]] introduced several proposed constitutional amendments during a speech to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=speech&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/legislative/resources/education/bill-of-rights/images/handout-2.pdf "James Madison's Proposed Amendments to the Constitution"], ''[[Congressional Record|Annals of Congress]]'' (June 8, 1789).&lt;/ref&gt; His draft language that later became the Fifth Amendment was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Obrien, David.  [http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2581&amp;context=ndlr "Fifth Amendment: Fox Hunters, Old Women, Hermits, and the Burger Court"], ''[[Notre Dame Law Review]]'', Vol. 54, p. 30 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=speech /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;No person shall be subject, except in cases of impeachment, to more than one punishment or trial for the same offense; nor shall be compelled to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor be obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation....[E]xcept in cases of impeachments, and cases arising in the land or naval forces, or the militia when on actual service, in time of war or public danger...in all crimes punishable with loss of life or member, presentment or indictment by a grand jury shall be an essential preliminary....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This draft was edited by Congress; all the material before the first ellipsis was placed at the end, and some of the wording was modified.  After approval by Congress, the amendment was ratified by the states on December 15, 1791 as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].  Every one of the five clauses in the final amendment appeared in Madison's draft, and in their final order those clauses are the [[Grand juries in the United States#Grand Jury Clause|Grand Jury Clause]] (which Madison had placed last), the [[Double Jeopardy Clause]], the [[Self-incrimination#United_States_law|Self Incrimination Clause]], the [[Due Process Clause]], and then the [[Takings Clause]].

==Grand jury==
{{further|Grand juries in the United States}}
The [[grand jury]] is a pre-constitutional common law institution, and a constitutional fixture in its own right exclusively embracing common law. The process applies to the states to the extent that the states have incorporated grand juries and/or common law. Most states have an alternative civil process. "Although state systems of criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, the grand jury is similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important role in fair and effective law enforcement in the overwhelming [p688] majority of the States." Branzburg v. Hayes (No. 70-85) 1972. [[Grand jury|Grand juries]], which return [[indictment]]s in many criminal cases, are composed of a jury of peers and operate in closed deliberation proceedings; they are given [[Jury instructions|specific instructions regarding the law]] by the judge. Many constitutional restrictions that apply in court or in other situations do not apply during grand jury proceedings. For example, the [[exclusionary rule]] does not apply to certain evidence presented to a grand jury; the exclusionary rule states that evidence obtained in violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth]], Fifth or [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth amendment]]s cannot be introduced in court.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Calandra]]'', {{ussc|414|338|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, an individual does not have the right to have an attorney present in the grand jury room during hearings. An individual would have such a right during questioning by the police while in custody, but an individual testifying before a grand jury is free to leave the grand jury room to consult with his attorney outside the room before returning to answer a question.

[[File:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|190px|thumb| The Bill of Rights in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]].]]
Currently, federal law permits the trial of [[misdemeanor]]s without indictments.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Duke v. United States]]'', {{ussc|301|492|1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in trials of non-capital felonies, the prosecution may proceed without indictments if the defendants waive their Fifth Amendment right.

Grand jury indictments may be amended by the prosecution only in limited circumstances. In ''[[Ex Parte Bain]]'', {{ussc|121|1|1887}}, the Supreme Court held that the indictment could not be changed at all by the prosecution. ''United States v. Miller'', {{ussc|471|130|1985}} partly reversed ''Ex parte Bain''; now, an indictment's scope may be narrowed by the prosecution. Thus, lesser included charges may be dropped, but new charges may not be added.

The Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not protect those serving in the armed forces, whether during wartime or peacetime. Members of the state militia called up to serve with federal forces are not protected under the clause either. In ''[[O'Callahan v. Parker]]'', {{ussc|395|258|1969}}, the Supreme Court held that only charges relating to service may be brought against members of the militia without indictments. That decision was overturned in 1987, when the Court held that members of the militia in actual service may be tried for any offense without indictments.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Solorio v. United States]]'', {{ussc|483|435|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand jury indictment clause of the Fifth Amendment has not been [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporated]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hurtado v. California]]'', {{ussc|110|517|1884}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the grand jury requirement applies only to felony charges in the federal court system. While many states ''do'' employ grand juries, no defendant has a Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury for criminal charges in state court. States are free to abolish grand juries, and many (though not all) have replaced them with [[preliminary hearing]].

===Infamous crime===
Whether a crime is "infamous", for purposes of the Grand Jury Clause, is determined by the nature of the punishment that may be imposed, not the punishment that is actually imposed;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ex parte Wilson]]'', {{ussc|114|417|1885}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, crimes punishable by [[Capital punishment in the United States|death]] must be tried upon [[indictment]]s. The historical origin of "infamous crime" comes from the ''[[infamia]]'', a punishment under Roman law by which a citizen was deprived his citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Cox, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4202544690014107094&amp;q=infamia&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006#r%5B38%5D 342 F.2d 167, 187 fn.7] (5th Cir. 1965) ([[John Minor Wisdom|Wisdom]], J., specially concurring) citing Greenidge, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenidge|first1=Abel Hendy Jones|authorlink=Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge|title=Infamia: Its Place in Roman Public and Private Law|date=1894|publisher=Claredon Press|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEbiAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[United States v. Moreland]]'', {{ussc|258|433|1922}}, the Supreme Court held that incarceration in a prison or penitentiary, as opposed to a correction or reformation house, attaches infamy to a crime. In ''[[s:Mackin v. United States|Mackin v. United States]]'', {{ussc|117|348|1886}}, the Supreme Court judged that "'Infamous crimes' are thus, in the most explicit words, defined to be those 'punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary.'", while it later in ''[[s:Green v. United States (356 U.S. 165)|Green v. United States]]'' {{ussc|356|165|1957}}, stated that "imprisonment in a penitentiary can be imposed only if a crime is subject to imprisonment exceeding one year". Therefore, an infamous crime is one that is punished by imprisonment for over one year. Susan Brown, a former defense attorney and Professor of Law at the [[University of Dayton School of Law]], concluded: "Since this is essentially the definition of a [[felony]], infamous crimes translate as felonies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Susan|title=Federal Grand Jury - "Infamous crimes"--part 1|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/~grandjur/feedback/feedba10.htm|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double jeopardy==
{{main|Double Jeopardy Clause}}
: ...nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb...&lt;ref name = "fifth amendment double jeopardy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Harper | first = Timothy | title = The Complete Idiot's Guide to the U.S. Constitution | publisher = Penguin Group | date = October 2, 2007 | page = 109 | isbn = 978-1-59257-627-2 |quote= "However, the Fifth Amendment contains several other important provisions for protecting your rights. It is the source of the double jeopardy doctrine, which prevents authorities from trying a person twice for the same crime&amp;nbsp;..." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses four distinct prohibitions: subsequent prosecution after acquittal, subsequent prosecution after conviction, subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials, and multiple punishment in the same indictment.&lt;ref&gt;[[North Carolina v. Pearce]], 395 U.S. 711 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; Jeopardy applies when the jury is empaneled in a jury trial, when the first witness is sworn in during a bench trial, or when a plea is rendered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Crist v. Bretz]], 437 U.S. 28 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prosecution after acquittal===
The government is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a [[directed verdict]] before the case is submitted to the jury,&lt;ref&gt;[[Fong Foo v. United States]], 369 U.S. 141 (1962); [[Sanabria v. United States]],  437 U.S. 54 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury,&lt;ref&gt;[[United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.]], 430 U.S. 564 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court),&lt;ref&gt;[[Burks v. United States]], 437 U.S. 1 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; or an "implied acquittal" via conviction of a lesser included offense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Green v. United States]], 355 U.S. 184 (1957).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the government is barred by [[collateral estoppel]] from re-litigating against the same defense, a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ashe v. Swenson]],  397 U.S. 436 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; even if the jury hung on other counts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yeager v. United States]], 557 U.S. 110 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle does not prevent the government from appealing a pre-trial motion to dismiss&lt;ref&gt;[[Serfass v. United States]], 420 U.S. 377 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; or other non-merits dismissal,&lt;ref&gt;[[United States v. Scott]], 437 U.S. 82 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; or a directed verdict after a jury conviction,&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilson v. United States]], 420 U.S. 332 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;  nor does it prevent the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a directed verdict, if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or statute.&lt;ref&gt;[[Smith v. Massachusetts]], 543 U.S. 462 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the defendant after an appellate reversal other than for sufficiency,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ball v. United States]], 163 U.S. 662 (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; including habeas,&lt;ref&gt;[[United States v. Tateo]], 377 U.S. 463 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; or "thirteenth juror" appellate reversals notwithstanding sufficiency&lt;ref&gt;[[Tibbs v. Florida]], 457 U.S. 31 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; on the principle that jeopardy has not "terminated." There is also an exception for judicial bribery in a bench trial.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleman v. Judges of the Circuit Court of Cook County]], 138 F.3d 302  (7th Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple punishment, including prosecution after conviction===
In ''[[Blockburger v. United States]]'' (1932), the Supreme Court announced the following test: the government may separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Blockburger v. United States]], 284 U.S. 299 (1932). ''See, e.g.'', [[Brown v. Ohio]], 432 U.S. 161 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blockburger'' is the default rule, unless the legislature intends to depart; for example, [[Continuing Criminal Enterprise]] (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates,&lt;ref&gt;[[Garrett v. United States]],  471 U.S. 773 (1985); [[Rutledge v. United States]], 517 U.S. 292 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; as can conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States v. Felix]], 503 U.S. 378 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Blockburger'' test, originally developed in the multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Missouri v. Hunter]], 459 U.S. 359 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Grady v. Corbin]]'' (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the ''Blockburger'' test was not satisfied,&lt;ref&gt;[[Grady v. Corbin]], 495 U.S. 508 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Grady'' was overruled in ''[[United States v. Dixon]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;[[United States v. Dixon]], 509 U.S. 688 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prosecution after mistrial===
The rule for [[mistrial]]s depends upon who sought the mistrial. If the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, unless the prosecutor acted in "bad faith", i.e., goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a mistrial.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oregon v. Kennedy]]'', 456 U.S. 667 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial if the trial judge finds "manifest necessity" for granting the mistrial.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Arizona v. Washington]]'', 434 U.S. 497 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The same standard governs mistrials granted ''[[sua sponte]]''.

===Prosecution in different States===

In [[Heath v. Alabama]] (1985), the Supreme Court held, that the Fifth Amendment rule against double jeopardy does not prohibit two different states from separately prosecuting and convicting the same individual for the same illegal act.

==Self-incrimination==
{{redirect|Plead the Fifth|the album by the band Taproot|Plead the Fifth (album)}}

The Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being forced to [[self-incrimination|incriminate themselves]]. Incriminating oneself is defined as exposing oneself (or another person) to "an accusation or charge of crime," or as involving oneself (or another person) "in a criminal prosecution or the danger thereof."&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'', p. 690 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''privilege'' against compelled self-incrimination is defined as "the constitutional right of a person to refuse to answer questions or otherwise give testimony against himself.&amp;nbsp;... "&lt;ref&gt;From "Self-Incrimination, Privilege Against," ''Barrons Law Dictionary'', p. 434 (2d ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; To "plead the Fifth" is to refuse to answer any question because "the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked" lead a claimant to possess a "reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer", believing that "a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result."&lt;ref&gt;''Ohio v. Reiner'', {{ussc|532|17|2001}}, citing ''Hoffman v. U.S.'', {{ussc|351|479|1951}}; cf. ''Counselman v. Hitchcock'', {{ussc|142|547|1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the legal protection against compelled self-incrimination was directly related to the question of torture for extracting information and confessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bill of Rights |last=Amar |first=Akhil Reed |authorlink=Akhil Reed Amar |year=1998 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-08277-0 |page=84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=America's Constitution |last=Amar |first=Akhil Reed |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=1-4000-6262-4 |page=329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal shift away from widespread use of torture and forced confession dates to turmoil of the late 16th and early 17th century in [[England]].&lt;ref name="[[ex-officio-mero]]"&gt;{{cite book |last=Greaves |first=Richard L. |title=Society and religion in Elizabethan England |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |year=1981 |isbn=0-8166-1030-4 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=ULHy6AZPd_wC&amp;pg=PA64 |accessdate=19 July 2009 |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |oclc=7278140 |pages=649, 681 |chapter=Legal Problems |quote=This situation worsened in the 1580s and 1590s when the machinery of&amp;nbsp;... the High Commission, was turned against Puritans&amp;nbsp;... in which a key weapon was the oath ''ex officio mero'', with its capacity for self incrimination&amp;nbsp;... Refusal to take this oath usually was regarded as proof of guilt.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone refusing to take the oath ''ex officio mero'' (confessions or swearing of innocence, usually before hearing any charges) was considered guilty.&lt;ref name="[[ex-officio-mero]]" /&gt; Suspected [[Puritans]] were pressed to take the oath and then reveal names of other Puritans. Coercion and torture were commonly used to compel "cooperation." Puritans, who were at the time fleeing to the [[New World]], began a practice of refusing to cooperate with interrogations. In the most famous case [[John Lilburne]] refused to take the oath in 1637. His case and his call for "[[freeborn]] rights" were rallying points for reforms against forced oaths, forced self-incrimination, and other kinds of coercion. [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s revolution overturned the practice and incorporated protections, in response to a popular group of English citizens known as the [[Levellers]]. The Levellers presented ''The Humble Petition of Many Thousands'' to [[Parliament]] in 1647 with 13 demands, the third of which was the right against self-incrimination in criminal cases. These protections were brought to America by Puritans, and were later incorporated into the United States Constitution through the Bill of Rights.

Protection against compelled self-incrimination is implicit in the [[Miranda rights]] statement, which protects the "right to remain silent." This amendment is also similar to [[Section 13 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. In other [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries like [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the right to silence of the accused both during questioning and at trial is regarded as an important right inherited from common law, and is protected in the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|New Zealand Bill of Rights Act]] and in Australia through various federal and state acts and codes governing the criminal justice system.

In [[South African]] law the right to silence originating from English common law has been entrenched in Section 35 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.

The Supreme Court has held that "a witness may have a reasonable fear of prosecution and yet be innocent of any wrongdoing. The privilege serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;''Ohio v. Reiner'', {{ussc|532|17|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Professor James Duane of the Regent University School of Law argues that the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision in ''Salinas v. Texas'',&lt;ref&gt; {{ussc|570|12-246|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; significantly weakened the privilege, saying "our choice to use the Fifth Amendment privilege can be used against you at trial depending exactly how and where you do it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/law-professor-police-interrogation-law-constitution-survival |title=A Law Professor Explains Why You Should Never Talk to Police |publisher=Vice.com |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Salinas'' case, justices Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy held that "the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to defendants who simply decide to remain mute during questioning. Long-standing judicial precedent has held that any witness who desires protection against self-incrimination must explicitly claim that protection."

Justice Thomas, siding with Alito, Roberts and Kennedy, in a separate opinion, held that, "Salinas' Fifth Amendment privilege would not have been applicable even if invoked because the prosecutor's testimony regarding his silence did not compel Salinas to give self-incriminating testimony." Justice Antonin Scalia joined Thomas' opinion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/us/supreme-court-hands-down-three-decisions-that-are-5-to-4.html
|title=A 5-4 Ruling, One of Three, Limits Silence’s Protection |work=New York Times |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal proceedings and congressional hearings===
The Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination applies when an individual is called to testify in a legal proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Rule 608(b), Federal Rules of Evidence, as amended through Dec. 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court ruled that the privilege applies whether the witness is in a federal court or, under the [[incorporation doctrine]] of the Fourteenth Amendment, in a state court,&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Z. Mannheimer, "Ripeness of Self-Incrimination Clause Disputes," ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'', Vol. 95, No. 4, p. 1261, footnote 1 (Northwestern Univ. School of Law 2005), citing ''[[Malloy v. Hogan]]'', {{Ussc|378|1|1964}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and whether the proceeding itself is criminal or civil.&lt;ref&gt;''[[McCarthy v. Arndstein]]'', 266 U.S. 34 (1924)).&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to remain silent was asserted at grand jury or [[Congress of the United States|congressional]] hearings in the 1950s, when witnesses testifying before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] or the [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]] claimed the right in response to questions concerning their alleged membership in the [[Communist Party]]. Under the [[Red Scare]] hysteria at the time of [[McCarthyism]], witnesses who refused to answer the questions were accused as "fifth amendment communists". They lost jobs or positions in unions and other political organizations, and suffered other repercussions after "taking the Fifth."

Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] (R-Wisc.) asked, "Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party," while he was chairman of the Senate Government Operations Committee Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Admitting to a previous Communist Party membership was not sufficient. Witnesses were also required to "name names," to implicate others they knew to be Communists or who had been Communists in the past. [[Academy Award]] winning director [[Elia Kazan]] testified before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] that he had belonged to the Communist Party briefly in his youth. He also "named names," which incurred enmity of many in Hollywood. Other entertainers such as [[Zero Mostel]] found themselves on a [[Hollywood blacklist]] after taking the Fifth, and were unable to find work for a while in show business. Pleading the Fifth in response to such questions was held inapplicable,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} since being a Communist itself was not a crime.

The amendment has also been used by defendants and witnesses in criminal cases involving the [[American Mafia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Statements made to non-governmental entities===
The privilege against self-incrimination does not protect an individual from being suspended from membership in a non-governmental, [[self-regulatory organization]] (SRO), such as the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), where the individual refuses to answer questions posed by the SRO. An SRO itself is not a court of law, and cannot send a person to jail. SROs, such as the NYSE and the [[National Association of Securities Dealers]] (NASD), are generally not considered to be state actors. See ''United States v. Solomon'',&lt;ref&gt;509 F. 2d 863 (2d Cir. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; ''D. L. Cromwell Invs., Inc. v. NASD Regulation, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;132 F. Supp. 2d 248, 251-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), ''aff'd'', 279 F.3d 155, 162 (2d Cir. 2002), ''cert. denied'', 537 U.S. 1028 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Marchiano v. NASD''.&lt;ref&gt;134 F. Supp. 2d 90, 95 (D.D.C. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; SROs also lack subpoena powers. They rely heavily on requiring testimony from individuals by wielding the threat of loss of membership or a bar from the industry (permanent, if decided by the NASD) when the individual asserts his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. If a person chooses to provide statements in testimony to the SRO, the SRO may provide information about those statements to law enforcement agencies, who may then use the statements in a prosecution of the individual.

===Custodial interrogation===
The Fifth Amendment limits the use of evidence obtained illegally by law enforcement officers. Originally, at [[common law]], even a confession obtained by [[torture]] was admissible. However, by the eighteenth century, common law in England provided that coerced confessions were inadmissible. The common law rule was incorporated into American law by the courts. The Supreme Court has repeatedly overruled convictions based on such confessions, in cases such as ''[[Brown v. Mississippi]]'', {{ussc|297|278|1936}}.

Law enforcement responded by switching to more subtle techniques, but the courts held that such techniques, even if they do not involve physical torture, may render a confession involuntary and inadmissible. In ''[[Chambers v. Florida]]'' (1940) the Court held a confession obtained after five days of prolonged questioning, during which time the defendant was held incommunicado, to be coerced. In ''[[Ashcraft v. Tennessee (1944)|Ashcraft v. Tennessee]]'' (1944), the suspect had been interrogated continuously for thirty-six hours under electric lights. In ''Haynes v. Washington'',&lt;ref&gt;373 U.S. 503 (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; the Court held that an "unfair and inherently coercive context" including a prolonged interrogation rendered a confession inadmissible.

''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' (1966) was a landmark case involving confessions. [[Ernesto Miranda]] had signed a statement confessing to the crime, but the Supreme Court held that the confession was inadmissible because the defendant had not been advised of his rights.

The Court held "the prosecution may not use statements&amp;nbsp;... stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. Custodial interrogation is initiated by law enforcement after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of movement before being questioned as to the specifics of the crime.

As for the procedural safeguards to be employed, unless other fully effective means are devised to inform accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following measures are required. Before any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed." The warning to which Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] referred is now called the [[Miranda warning]], and it is customarily delivered by the police to an individual before questioning.

''Miranda'' has been clarified by several further Supreme Court rulings. For the warning to be necessary, the questioning must be conducted under "custodial" circumstances. A person detained in jail or under arrest is, of course, deemed to be in police custody. Alternatively, a person who is under the ''reasonable belief'' that he may not freely leave from the restraint of law enforcement is also deemed to be in "custody." That determination of "reasonableness" is based on a totality of the objective circumstances. A mere presence at a police station may not be sufficient, but neither is such a presence required. Traffic stops are not deemed custodial. The Court has ruled that age can be an objective factor. In ''[[Yarborough v. Alvarado]]'' (2004), the Court held that "a state-court decision that failed to mention a 17-year-old's age as part of the Miranda custody analysis was not objectively unreasonable".&lt;ref name=jdb&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-11121.pdf ''J.D.B. v. North Carolina''], "United States Supreme Court", June 16, 2011, accessed June 20th, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In her concurring opinion [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]] wrote that a suspect's age may indeed "be relevant to the 'custody' inquiry";&lt;ref name=alvarado&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1684.ZC.html ''Yarborough v. Alvarado''], "United States Supreme Court", June 1, 2004, accessed June 20th, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court did not find it relevant in the specific case of ''Alvarado''. The Court affirmed that age could be a relevant and objective factor in ''[[J.D.B. v. North Carolina]]'' where they ruled that "so long as the child's age was known to the officer at the time of police questioning, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custody analysis is consistent with the objective nature of that test".&lt;ref name=jdb /&gt;

The questioning does not have to be explicit to trigger Miranda rights. For example, two police officers engaging in a conversation designed to elicit an incriminating statement from a suspect would constitute questioning. A person may choose to waive his Miranda rights, but the prosecution has the burden of showing that such a waiver was actually made.

A confession not preceded by a Miranda warning where one was necessary cannot be admitted as evidence against the confessing party in a judicial proceeding. The Supreme Court, however, has held that if a defendant voluntarily testifies at the trial that he did not commit the crime, his confession may be introduced to challenge his credibility, to "impeach" the witness, even if it had been obtained without the warning.

In ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that being required to identify oneself to police under states' [[stop and identify statutes]] is not an unreasonable search or seizure, and is not necessarily self-incrimination.

==== Explicit invocation ====

In June 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Berghuis v. Thompkins]]'' that a criminal suspect must now invoke the right to remain silent unambiguously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Justice Kennedy |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1470.ZO.html |title=Berghuis v. Thompkins |work=Law.cornell.edu |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unless and until the suspect actually states that he is relying on that right, police may continue to interact with (or question) him, and any voluntary statement he makes can be used in court. The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked those rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply, even after lengthy silence, can be construed as implying a waiver. The new rule will defer to police in cases where the suspect fails to  assert the right to remain silent. This standard was extended in ''[[w:Berghuis v. Thompkins#Subsequent ruling in Salinas v. Texas|Salinas v. Texas]]'' in 2013 to cases where individuals not in custody who volunteer to answer officers' questions and who are not told their Miranda rights. The Court stated that there was no "ritualistic formula" necessary to assert this right, but that a person could not do so "by simply standing mute."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Salinas v. Texas'', no. 12-246, U.S. Supreme Court (June 17, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mukasey|first=Marc L.|title=Salinas v.

===Production of documents===
Under the Act of Production Doctrine, the act of an individual in producing documents or materials (e.g., in response to a subpoena) may have a "testimonial aspect" for purposes of the individual's right to assert the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to the extent that the individual's act of production provides information not already in the hands of law enforcement personnel about the (1) existence; (2) custody; or (3) authenticity, of the documents or materials produced. See ''[[United States v. Hubbell]]''. In ''[[Boyd v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;116 U.S. 616 (1886).&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Supreme Court stated that "It is equivalent to a compulsory production of papers to make the nonproduction of them a confession of the allegations which it is pretended they will prove".

====By corporations====
Corporations may also be compelled to maintain and turn over records; the Supreme Court has held that the Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination extend only to "natural persons."&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. v. Kordel'', {{ussc|397|1|1970}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court has also held that a corporation's custodian of records can be forced to produce corporate documents ''even'' if the act of production would incriminate him personally.&lt;ref&gt;''Braswell v. U.S.'', {{ussc|487|99|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The only limitation on this rule is that the jury cannot be told that the custodian personally produced those documents in any subsequent prosecution of him, but the jury is still allowed to draw adverse inferences from the content of the documents combined with the position of the custodian in the corporation.

===Refusal to testify in a criminal case===
In ''[[Griffin v. California]]'' (1965), the Supreme Court ruled that a prosecutor may not ask the jury to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's [[right to silence|refusal to testify]] in his own defense. The Court overturned as unconstitutional under the federal constitution a provision of the California state constitution that explicitly granted such power to prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ussc|380|609|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refusal to testify in a civil case===
While defendants are entitled to assert the right against compelled self-incrimination in a civil court case, there are consequences to the assertion of the right in such an action.

The Supreme Court has held that "the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them." ''Baxter v. Palmigiano'',&lt;ref&gt;425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; "[A]s Mr. Justice Brandeis declared, speaking for a unanimous court in the ''Tod'' case, 'Silence is often evidence of the most persuasive character.'"&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 319 (quoting ''United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod'', 263 U.S. 149, 153–154 (1923)).&lt;/ref&gt; "'Failure to contest an assertion&amp;nbsp;... is considered evidence of acquiescence&amp;nbsp;... if it would have been natural under the circumstances to object to the assertion in question.'"&lt;ref&gt;Id. (quoting ''United States v. Hale'', 422 U.S. 171, 176 (1975)).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Baxter'', the state was entitled to an adverse inference against Palmigiano because of the evidence against him and his assertion of the Fifth Amendment right.

Some civil cases are considered "criminal cases" for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment. In ''[[Boyd v. United States]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court stated that "A proceeding to forfeit a person's goods for an offence against the laws, though civil in form, and whether in rem or in personam, is a "criminal case" within the meaning of that part of the Fifth Amendment which declares that no person "shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/116/616/case.html|title=Boyd v. United States :: 116 U.S. 616 (1886) :: Justia U.S. Supreme Court Center|work=Justia Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal income tax===
In some cases, individuals may be legally required to file reports that call for information that may be used against them in criminal cases. In ''United States v. Sullivan'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Ussc|274|259|1927}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the United States Supreme Court ruled that a taxpayer could not invoke the Fifth Amendment's protections as the basis for refusing to file a required federal income tax return. The Court stated: "If the form of return provided called for answers that the defendant was protected from making[,] he could have raised the objection in the return, but could not on that account refuse to make any return at all. We are not called on to decide what, if anything, he might have withheld."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Sullivan'', 274 U.S. 259 (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Garner v. United States'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Ussc|424|648|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant was convicted of crimes involving a conspiracy to "fix" sporting contests and to transmit illegal bets. During the trial the prosecutor introduced, as evidence, the taxpayer's federal income tax returns for various years. In one return the taxpayer had showed his occupation to be "professional gambler." In various returns the taxpayer had reported income from "gambling" or "wagering." The prosecution used this to help contradict the taxpayer's argument that his involvement was innocent. The taxpayer tried unsuccessfully to keep the prosecutor from introducing the tax returns as evidence, arguing that since the taxpayer was legally required to report the illegal income on the returns, he was being compelled to be a witness against himself. The Supreme Court agreed that he was legally required to report the [[Taxation of illegal income in the United States|illegal income]] on the returns, but ruled that the right against self-incrimination still did not apply. The Court stated that "if a witness under compulsion to testify makes disclosures instead of claiming the right, the Government has not 'compelled' him to incriminate himself."&lt;ref&gt;''Garner v. United States'', 424 U.S. 648 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sullivan'' and ''Garner'' are viewed as standing, in tandem, for the proposition that on a required federal income tax return a taxpayer would probably have to report the amount of the illegal income, but might validly claim the right by labeling the item "Fifth Amendment" (instead of "illegal gambling income," "illegal drug sales," etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miniter |first1=Frank |title=Saving the Bill of Rights: Exposing the Left's Campaign to Destroy American Exceptionalism |publisher=Regnery Publishing |year=2011 |page=204 |isbn=978-1-59698-150-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has stated: "Although the source of income might be privileged, the amount must be reported."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Pilcher'', 672 F.2d 875 (11th Cir.), ''cert. denied'', 459 U.S. 973 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has stated: ".&amp;nbsp;... the ''amount'' of a taxpayer's income is not privileged even though the ''source'' of income may be, and Fifth Amendment rights can be exercised in compliance with the tax laws "by simply listing his alleged ill-gotten gains in the space provided for 'miscellaneous' income on his tax form."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Wade'', 585 F.2d 573 (5th Cir. 1978), ''cert. denied'', 440 U.S. 928 (1979) (italics in original).&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated: "While the ''source'' of some of [the defendant] Johnson's income may have been privileged, assuming that the jury believed his uncorroborated testimony that he had illegal dealings in gold in 1970 and 1971, the ''amount'' of his income was not privileged and he was required to pay taxes on it."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Johnson'', 577 F.2d 1304 (5th Cir. 1978) (italics in original).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stated: "A careful reading of ''Sullivan'' and ''Garner'', therefore, is that the self-incrimination privilege can be employed to protect the taxpayer from revealing the information as to an illegal source of income, but does not protect him from disclosing the amount of his income."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Brown'', 600 F.2d 248 (10th Cir. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grants of immunity===
If the government gives an individual immunity, then that individual may be compelled to testify. Immunity may be "transactional immunity" or "use immunity"; in the former, the witness is immune from prosecution for offenses related to the testimony; in the latter, the witness may be prosecuted, but his testimony may not be used against him. In ''[[Kastigar v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|406|441|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that the government need only grant use immunity to compel testimony. The use immunity, however, must extend not only to the testimony made by the witness, but also to all evidence derived therefrom. This scenario most commonly arises in cases related to [[organized crime]].

===Record keeping===
A statutorily required record-keeping system may go too far such that it implicates a record-keeper's right against self-incrimination. A three part test laid out by ''[[Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board]]'',&lt;ref&gt;382 U.S. 70 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; is used to determine this: 1. the law targets a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities; 2. the activities sought to be regulated are already permeated with criminal statutes as opposed to essentially being non-criminal and largely regulatory; and 3. the disclosure compelled creates a likelihood of prosecution and is used against the record-keeper.  In this case, the Supreme Court struck down an order by the [[Subversive Activities Control Board]] requiring members of the [[Communist Party of the United States|Communist Party]] to register with the government and upheld an assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, on the grounds that statute under which the order had been issued was "directed at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities."

In ''[[Leary v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;395 U.S. 6 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; the court struck down the [[Marijuana Tax Act]] because its record keeping statute required [[self-incrimination]].

In ''[[Haynes v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;390 U.S. 85 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that, because convicted felons are prohibited from owning firearms, requiring felons to register any firearms they owned constituted a form of [[self-incrimination]] and was therefore unconstitutional.

===Combinations and passwords===
While no such case has yet arisen, the Supreme Court has indicated that a respondent cannot be compelled to turn over "the contents of his own mind", e.g. he cannot be compelled to reveal the password to a bank account if doing so would prove the existence of the bank account under his control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Justice Blackmun |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/487/201#writing-type-1-BLACKMUN |title=John Doe v.

Lower courts have given conflicting decisions on whether forced disclosure of computer passwords is a violation of the Fifth Amendment.

In ''[[In re Boucher]]'' (2009), the [[United States District Court for the District of Vermont|US District Court of Vermont]] ruled that the Fifth Amendment might protect a defendant from having to reveal an encryption password, or even the existence of one, if the production of that password could be deemed a self-incriminating "act" under the Fifth Amendment. In ''Boucher'', production of the unencrypted drive was deemed not to be a self-incriminating act, as the government already had sufficient evidence to tie the encrypted data to the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=[[In re Boucher|In re Grand Jury Subpoena to Sebastien Boucher]] |vol= |reporter= |opinion=No. 2:06-mj-91, 2009 WL 424718 |pinpoint= |court=D.

In January 2012 a federal judge in Denver ruled that a bank-fraud suspect was required to give an unencrypted copy of a laptop hard drive to prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;See docket entry 247, "ORDER GRANTING APPLICATION UNDER THE ALL WRITS ACT REQUIRING DEFENDANT FRICOSU TO ASSIST IN THE EXECUTION OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED SEARCH WARRANTS", ''United States v.

===Employer coercion===
As a condition of employment, workers may be required to answer their employer's narrowly defined questions regarding conduct on the job. If an employee invokes the [[Garrity rule]] (sometimes called the [[Garrity Warning]] or Garrity Rights) before answering the questions, then the answers cannot be used in criminal prosecution of the employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=International Association of Fire Chiefs |title=Chief Officer: Principles and Practice |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-7637-7929-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle was developed in ''[[Garrity v. New Jersey]]'', 385 U.S. 493 (1967). The rule is most commonly applied to public employees such as police officers.

==Due process==
{{Main|Due Process Clause}}

==Takings clause==

===Eminent domain===
{{main|Eminent domain}}
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has held that the federal government and each state has the power of [[eminent domain]]&amp;mdash;the power to take private property for "[[public use]]". The ''Takings Clause'', the last clause of the Fifth Amendment, limits the power of eminent domain by requiring that "just compensation" be paid if private property is taken for public use. The just compensation provision of the Fifth Amendment did not originally apply directly to the states, but since [[Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co. v. Chicago|''Chicago, B. &amp; Q. Railroad Co. v. Chicago'' (1897)]], federal courts have held that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extended the effects of that provision to the states. The federal courts, however, have shown much deference to the determinations of Congress, and even more so to the determinations of the state legislatures, of what constitutes "public use". The property need not actually be used by the public; rather, it must be used or disposed of in such a manner as to benefit the public welfare or public interest. One exception that restrains the federal government is that the property must be used in exercise of a government's enumerated powers.

The owner of the property that is taken by the government must be justly compensated. When determining the amount that must be paid, the government does not need to take into account any speculative schemes in which the owner claims the property was intended to be used. Normally, the [[Fair market value|fair market value]] of the property determines "just compensation". If the property is taken before the payment is made, interest accrues (though the courts have refrained from using the term "interest").

The federal courts have not restrained state and local governments from seizing privately owned land for private commercial development on behalf of private developers. This was upheld on June 23, 2005, when the Supreme Court issued its opinion in ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]].'' This 5&amp;ndash;4 decision remains controversial. The majority opinion, by [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]], found that it was appropriate to defer to the city's decision that the development plan had a public purpose, saying that "the city has carefully formulated a development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including, but not limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue." Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion observed that in this particular case the development plan was not "of primary benefit to&amp;nbsp;... the developer" and that if that was the case the plan might have been impermissible. In the dissent, Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] argued that this decision would allow the rich to benefit at the expense of the poor, asserting that "Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms." She argued that the decision eliminates "any distinction between private and [[public use]] of property&amp;mdash;and thereby effectively delete[s] the words 'for public use' from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment". A number of states, in response to Kelo, have passed laws and/or state constitutional amendments which make it more difficult for state governments to seize private land. Takings that are not "for public use" are not directly covered by the doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [[Berman v. Parker]].&lt;/ref&gt; however such a taking might violate [[Due process in the United States|due process]] rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth amendment]], or other applicable law.

The exercise of the police power of the state resulting in a taking of private property was long held to be an exception to the requirement of government paying just compensation. However the growing trend under the various state constitution's taking clauses is to compensate innocent third parties whose property was destroyed or "taken" as a result of police action.&lt;ref&gt;''Wegner v.Milwaukee Mutual, City of Minneapolis'' 479 N.W.2d 38 (Minn. 1991) and ''Steele v. City of Houston'' 603 S.W.2d 786 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Just compensation"===
The last two words of the amendment promise "just compensation" for takings by the government. In ''[[United States v. 50 Acres of Land]] (1984)'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] wrote that "The Court has repeatedly held that just compensation normally is to be measured by "the market value of the property at the time of the taking contemporaneously paid in money." ''[[Olson v. United States]]'', 292 U.S. 246 (1934) &amp;nbsp;... Deviation from this measure of just compensation has been required only "when market value has been too difficult to find, or when its application would result in manifest injustice to owner or public." ''[[United States v. Commodities Trading Corp.]]'', 339 U.S. 121, 123 (1950)''.

===Civil asset forfeiture===
{{Main article|Civil forfeiture in the United States}}
[[Civil forfeiture in the United States|Civil asset forfeiture]]&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.justice.gov/jmd/afp/07federalforfeiture/| title= Types of federal forfeiture| publisher= United States Department of Justice| date= January 2013| accessdate= October 14, 2014| quote=...&amp;nbsp;(Source: A Guide to Equitable Sharing of Federally Forfeited Property for State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies, U.S. Department of Justice, March 1994)| author= US Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; or occasionally civil seizure, is a [[Civil forfeiture in the United States#Controversy|controversial]] [[legal process]] in which [[law enforcement officer]]s take [[asset]]s from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While [[civil procedure]], as opposed to [[criminal procedure]], generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between [[law enforcement]] and ''property'' such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself.&lt;ref name="twsBostonGlobe"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/01/31/tewksbury-motel-owner-glad-close-book-seizure-threat/sNrZdQH4XG1EcKMYZVsKFI/story.html| title= Tewksbury motel owner glad to close book on seizure threat| publisher= Boston Globe| date= January 31, 2013| accessdate= October 11, 2014| quote=...&amp;nbsp;Motel Caswell&amp;nbsp;... free from the threat of seizure by US Attorney Carmen Ortiz&amp;nbsp;...| author= Brenda J. Buote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In civil forfeiture, assets are seized by police based on a suspicion of wrongdoing, and without having to charge a person with specific wrongdoing, with the case being between police and the ''thing itself'', sometimes referred to by the Latin term ''[[in rem jurisdiction|in rem]]'', meaning "against the property"; the property itself is the defendant and no criminal charge against the owner is needed.&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice"/&gt; If property is seized in a civil forfeiture, it is "up to the owner to prove that his cash is clean"&lt;ref name="twsNPR3"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91490480 | title= Seized Drug Assets Pad Police Budgets| publisher= NPR| date= June 16, 2008| accessdate= October 11, 2014| quote=...&amp;nbsp;Every year, about $12 billion in drug profits returns to Mexico from the world's largest narcotics market — the United States.&amp;nbsp;...| author= John Burnett}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the court can weigh a defendant's use of their 5th amendment right to remain silent in their decision.&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usab5506.pdf| title= A Prosecutor's Secret Weapon: Federal Civil Forfeiture Law| publisher= United States Department of Justice| date= November 2007| accessdate= October 24, 2014| quote= November 2007 Volume 55 Number 6 "...&amp;nbsp;One of the main advantages of civil forfeiture is that it has less stringent standards for obtaining a seizure warrant"&amp;nbsp;... see pages 60, 71...|author1=Craig Gaumer |author2=Assistant United States Attorney |author3=Southern District of Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In civil forfeiture, the test in most cases&lt;ref&gt;Note: the legal tests used to justify civil forfeiture vary according to state law, but in most cases the tests are looser than in criminal trials where the "beyond a reasonable doubt" test is predominant&lt;/ref&gt; is whether police feel there is a [[legal burden of proof#Preponderance of the evidence|preponderance of the evidence]] suggesting wrongdoing; in [[criminal forfeiture]], the test is whether police feel the evidence is [[reasonable doubt|beyond a reasonable doubt]], which is a tougher test to meet.&lt;ref name="twsNPR3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512253265073870 | title= Federal Asset Seizures Rise, Netting Innocent With Guilty| publisher= Wall Street Journal| date= August 22, 2011| accessdate= October 11, 2014| quote=...&amp;nbsp;New York businessman James Lieto&amp;nbsp;... Federal agents seized $392,000 of his cash anyway.&amp;nbsp;...|author1=John R. Emshwiller |author2=Gary Fields}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, criminal forfeiture is a legal action brought as "part of the criminal prosecution of a defendant", described by the Latin term ''[[in personam]]'', meaning "against the person", and happens when government indicts or charges the property which is either used in connection with a crime, or derived from a crime, that is suspected of being committed by the defendant;&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice"/&gt; the seized assets are temporarily held and become government property officially ''after'' an accused person has been convicted by a court of law; if the person is found to be not guilty, the seized property must be returned.

Normally both civil and criminal forfeiture require involvement by the judiciary; however, there is a variant of civil forfeiture called ''administrative forfeiture'' which is essentially a civil forfeiture which does not require involvement by the judiciary, which derives its powers from the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act|Tariff Act of 1930]], and empowers police to seize banned imported merchandise, as well as things used to import or transport or store a controlled substance, money, or other property which is less than $500,000 value.&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice"/&gt;

[[Snorri Thorfinnsson]] (probably born between 1005 and 1013) was the son of Thorfinnur Karlsefni and Gudrídur Þorbjarnardottir. Generally known to his contemporaries as Snorri Gudrídsson, as his mother outlived his father, was born in [[Vinland]], making him the first European documented to be born in North America.

===British, Dutch and Swedish colonies===
[[Virginia Dare]], born in 1587 at the [[Roanoke Colony]], was the first child born in North America to [[England|English]] parents, and her memory was celebrated in the [[British colonization of America|British colonies]].  [[Peregrine White]], born aboard the ''[[Mayflower]]'' at [[Provincetown Harbor]] in 1620, was the first [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrim]] birth.&lt;ref name="WordRon" /&gt; [[Sarah Rapelje]], born on June 6, 1625, was the first white child born in [[New Netherland]] in what is now [[New York (state)|New York state]].&lt;ref name="ColAnc"&gt;Colonial Ancestors.

===Canada===
[[Hélène Desportes]] is often cited as the first white child born in [[New France]], in what would later be [[Canada]]. She was born probably 1620, to Pierre Desportes and Françoise Langlois, although there is some disagreement about whether she was born in [[Quebec]] or before her family arrived on the continent in 1614.  Hélène's maternal aunt was the mother of Eustache Martin, born in October 1621 in Quebec to Abraham Martin and Marguerite Langlois.&lt;ref name="DCBO"&gt;{{cite DCB |last=Bennett |first=Ethel M.

Jonathan Guy, the son of [[Newfoundland]] settler [[Nicholas Guy]], was the first child born to [[English people|Anglophone]] parents in Canada, and one of the first born in any part of [[North America]] within a permanent settlement. He was born on 27 March 1613 in [[Cuper's Cove]], a settlement that has been continuously occupied since 1610 and where his family remained long after his birth&lt;ref name="DCBO2"&gt;{{cite DCB |last=Cell |first=Gillian T. |title=Guy, Nicholas |volume=1 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/guy_nicholas_1E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Port-Royal National Historic Site|Port Royal, Acadia]] in 1636, Pierre Martin and Catherine Vigneau, who had arrived on the passenger ship Saint Jehan along with 78 other migrants, were the first European parents to have a child in Acadia. The first-born child was Mathieu Martin. In part because of this distinction, Mathieu Martin later became the Seigneur of Cobequid (1699).&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, N. 1600-1650.

Seebaer van Nieuwelant (born 27 July 1623), son of Willemtgen and Willem Janszoon, was born south of [[Dirk Hartog Island]], in present-day [[Western Australia]]. His father, not to be confused with [[Willem Janszoon|the earlier Dutch explorer of the same name]], was a [[midshipman]] from [[Amsterdam]]. He and his wife were aboard the ''[[Leijden]]'', commanded by [[Claes Hermanszoon]], which was charting the coast at the time. Their son's name in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] meant "sea-born (or sea-birth) [[Tussenvoegsel|of]] new land".&lt;ref&gt;From the journal of the ''Leijden'' (or ''Leyden''): "On the 27th do.

The first white baby born in Rhodesia was named Unwin Moffat. He was the son of the missionary John Smith Moffat &amp; his wife Emily, nee Unwin. The child was born on the 18th of December 1858. The Moffats had eleven children between 1858 and 1871.  One of their sons, Howard Unwin Moffat, became premier of S. Rhodesia in 1927.

The '''Global Open Access List (GOAL)''', until January 2012 the '''American Scientist Open Access Forum''', is the longest-standing online discussion forum on [[Open access (publishing)|Open Access]] (free online access to [[peer-review]]ed research). It was created by the [[American Scientist]], which is published by [[Sigma Xi]], in September 1998, before the term "Open Access" (OA) was coined, and it was originally called the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110717232910/http://listserver.sigmaxi.org/sc/wa.exe?A0=september98-forum&amp;F=l September98-Forum]."  Its first focus was an article &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/free-internet-access-to-traditional-journals/1 Walker, T.J. (1998) Free Internet Access to Traditional Journals]. ''American Scientist'' 86(5) 463-71&lt;/ref&gt; published in [[American Scientist]] in which [http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/walker/ Thomas J Walker] of the [[University of Florida]] proposed that journals should furnish free online access out of the fees authors pay them to purchase reprints. [[Stevan Harnad]], who had in 1994 made the [[Subversive Proposal]] that all researchers should [[self archive]] their peer-reviewed research, was invited to moderate the forum, which was not expected to last more than a few months. It continued to grow in size and influence across the years and is still the site where most of the main developments in OA are first mooted, including [[self-archiving]], [[institutional repositories]], [[citation impact]], research [[performance metrics]], [[publishing]] reform, [[copyright]] reform, [[open access journals]], and [[open access mandate]]s.

'''Govi''', '''Govigama''' is the largest and the most influential [[caste]] in Sri Lanka. They and the [[Bathgama]] have traditionally been responsible for cultivation in accordance with the traditional tenure system of land-holding known as Rajakariya (duty).

While ''Govi'', meaning [[paddy field|paddy]] farmer, derives from the root word ''goyam'', meaning paddy plant,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LjbN5ePfQuYC&amp;q=goyankarayo#v=onepage&amp;q=goyikamkaranno&amp;f=false 15th century Janawamsaya on caste]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Govigama'' originated in the Dutch era. Traditionally all land was owned by the king and the rajakriya system meant you were duty bound to work the land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1495369&amp;pageno=122 An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon in the East Indies by Robert Knox, p. 122]&lt;/ref&gt; Private land ownership by ordinary folk came about only after European colonisation.&lt;ref&gt;http://pathfinderfoundation.org/pf-projects/on-going/economic-alert/44-land&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Occupation ===
The Govigama are a caste&lt;ref name="asiarecipe.com"&gt;[http://asiarecipe.com/sricaste.html Sri Lankan Caste System]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ywY_dN6ad8gC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Sanghamitta#v=onepage&amp;q=Sanghamitta&amp;f=false Castes &amp; Tribes at the time of Sanghamitta (Populations of the Saarc Countries: Bio-Cultural Perspectives By Jayanta Sarkar, G. C. Ghosh, p.73)]&lt;/ref&gt; whose traditional occupation is paddy cultivation, and they were the [[tenant farmers]] in the Sri Lankan [[feudal]] system. The Sinhalese caste system was based on the service to the king or 'raja kariya',&lt;ref name="asiarecipe.com" /&gt; and land ownership. The monarch owned all the lands of the island and Govigama people cultivated these lands at his behest. The contribution to rice production and service in royal service gave Govigama people an important role in the ancient agrarian society. Kings are said to have participated in harvesting festivals held end of each Yala (dry) and Maha (wet) season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LjbN5ePfQuYC&amp;pg=PA246 |title=The Adaptable Peasant |first=Nirmal Ranjith |last=Dewasiri |page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in the present era, it has been the norm that the head of the country is a Govigama caste member, though President Premadasa was not. Some [[Anglican]] Govigama that turned [[Buddhist]] in the past century popularized the myth that the colonial occupiers, including the Portuguese, Dutch and British, tried to change Govi dominance by giving prominence to other castes by granting government posts and education under them. Yet the evidence points other wise and the post monarch colonial era saw the rise of the ordinary/majority caste populace. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]] introduced the ideas of [[Republicanism]].

Many members of the Govigama community are still farmers in villages throughout Sri Lanka. However, some farmers other than rice farmers are not considered to be Govigama. A good example is the caste [[Salagama]]. Bathgama farmers are apparently a 'lesser' brand of rice farmer. Govigama women participate in the harvest work.

=== Names ===
An important characteristic in the Sinhalese caste system is that the family name or the surname details the ancestry. The original name was given based on where one lived. Later, honorary terms, granted by the king based on a person's service to the kingdom, were added to the original name. This continued for generations and resulted in very long names. In general, ''Mudiyanselage'' , ''[[Appuhamy|Appuhamilage]]'' among up country people, and ''[[Arachchi]]lage'' , ''Vidanelage'' , ''Pathiranage'' among low country people, are considered to be names taken up by Govigama and others to improve their social standing, and these names were extended according to the ranking in the service of the kingdom. Further variations exist due to changes during the colonial period. Historic literature and inscriptional evidence from the feudal period show that this hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period until the collapse of Sri Lankan kingdoms and social structure under the onslaught of European colonialism. However, even in the present day, Sinhalese people look at surnames and ancestry when it comes to marriages.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

As for name and religious conversions, Govigama families too became Christian and had Portuguese/Christian names (some strangely adopted during British/Dutch times) such as Don Davith (Rajapaksas)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2011/03/11/sri-lanka-revoke-british-governor%E2%80%99s-infamous-gazette-notification |accessdate=2016-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102192549/http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2011/03/11/sri-lanka-revoke-british-governor%E2%80%99s-infamous-gazette-notification|title= The Rajapaksas and Ruhuna|archivedate=2 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asiantribune.com/node/7175&lt;/ref&gt;, Barthlamew (Senanayakes), Ridgeway Dias (Nilaperumal/Bandaranaykes), Arnolis Dep (Wijewardane), de Sarem, de Alwis, etc. It is also why all elite Lankans of the [[British Empire|British]] period be it farmer or other wise had English first names. The Goyigama also were pioneer [[arrack]] renters of the colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o4K3AAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=goyigama+arrack+ Nobodies to somebodies: the rise of the colonial bourgeoisie in Sri Lanka] by Kumari Jayawardena (Zed Books) p.190-191 {{ISBN|1-84277-229-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social status ===
In traditional Sinhalese society Buddhist monks are placed at the top. Irrespective of the birth caste of a monk, even the king had to worship him. However, this led to some Buddhist sects in Sri Lanka allowing only Govigama people to join, contrary to Buddha's instructions. Other castes such as Karava, Durava, Salagama and Wahumpura have their own Buddhist sects, but they do not impose any restrictions based on caste creed or race, upon anyone who wishes to join. These practices imposed by the Govigama-only sect against the wishes of the Buddha had brought a negative reputation of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, especially when the largest Buddhist converts today are the Indian [[Dalit]] community, a practice that had also been common in the history of Buddhism. Though largely overlooked, the Govigama caste have historically incorporated south Indian migrants.&lt;ref name="JR"&gt;[http://sundaytimes.lk/010708/plus6.html ''J.R.

=== Ancient period ===
Ancient texts such as the ''Pujavaliya'', ''Sadharmaratnavaliya'' and ''Yogaratnakaraya'' list the four caste categories as [[Raja]] [[Kshatriya]], Bamunu [[Brahmana]], Velanda [[Vaishya]], and Govi in descending order. However, the current caste system in Sri Lanka disempowers the Raja, Bamunu, and Velanda castes, and establishes the Govigama caste as the highest extant caste in the hierarchy (Govi, Karave, Durava, Salagama, etc.). The ''Pújavaliya''{{Citation needed|reason=page numbers |date=August 2012}} also says that a [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] could be been born into the Govi caste, although in reality he was born into the Kshatriya caste. Theravada says there is only one Buddha per human era. The 10th-century ''Dampiyaatuvagetapadaya'' and the 12th-century ''Darmapradeepikava'' already state that the Govi caste is a middle caste compared to the kings. (Dampiyaatuvagetapadaya 217. Darmapradeepikava 190), indicating gradual rise from the bottom of society.

Other ancient texts such as the ''Gavaratnakaraya '' and ''Sarpothpaththiya'' (''Sarpavedakama'' vi, 5 &amp; 123) respectively classify even Sri Lankan cattle and snakes into the same four caste categories as Raja, Bamunu, Velanda, Govi, where again Govi is the lowest of them all. Secondary castes such as Durava and Salagama are not mentioned in these texts since they were later [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] migrants to Sri Lanka or small communities. However, the Govi community also has incorporated Dravidian latter migrants.&lt;ref name="JR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Betrayed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kshatriya"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 8543296 | volume=67 | title=Genetic affinities of Sri Lankan populations | date=December 1995 | journal=Hum.

The domestic utensils of the [[Kshatriya|''Raja'']] category are described as made of gold; silver and copper for the next two, and finally [[earthenware]] for the ''Govi'' caste (Gammaduwa 13).

King Nissanka Malla, who managed to chase out the Indians who destroyed the Raja, Bamunu, Welanda, and Govi castes by forced intermarriages,{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} authored a stone inscription, "Gal Potha", in Polonnaruwa, which clearly states that people of Govi caste should not even think of becoming the King of Ceylon.

Although modern writers have attempted to dismiss the above fourfold division as a mere classical division unconnected with reality, the repetition of the same caste hierarchy even as recently as the 18th century, in the [[United Kingdom|British]] / [[Kandyan]] period Kadayimpoth – Boundary books (Abhayawardena 163 to 168) as well, indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka’s monarchy or even further. It should be noted that no well known Karava / Salagama families existed in the Kandyan kingdom, the Govigama caste is considered as the highest caste in Sri Lanka not because of its numerical superiority, it is known as the one of the oldest cast in Sri Lanka. The "Karava" caste considered second in Sri Lanka was the specialist mariners/navigators also some of them are brought to Sri Lanka as Dravidian warriors throughout history,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlib.pdn.ac.lk:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/1044 Sinhalese Naval Power, C. W. Nicholas (1958)]&lt;/ref&gt; the "Salagama" caste has its origin in Kerala as "Saligrama Brahmins" who are even today considered as among the highest castes in Kerala &amp; the "Wahumpura" descending from the Deva (mountain people) of the Mahavamsa. Even though ancient literature such as "Pujavaliya" suggests that the Buddhas might be born in Govi Kula, ancient Indians believed that Buddhas are born only in the kshatrya(Raja kula).

=== Kandyan period ===
For the past 1.700 years the only undisputed symbol of Sri Lankan Royalty and Leadership has been the sacred [[Tooth Relic]] of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Whosoever possessed this was acknowledged as the rightful ruler of Lanka, and thus the Tooth Relic was a possession exclusive to the ruling dynasty of Sri Lanka. Upon each change of capital, a new palace was built to enshrine the Relic.  Finally, in 1595 it was brought to [[Kandy]] where it is at present, in the [[Temple of the Tooth]]. However, even in the land-locked [[Kandyan kingdom]] 'Unambuwe' a son of a concubine of some considerable background was deemed not of 'royalty', hence a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] of royalty was imported from [[Madurai]]. This last [[Kandyan]] royal dynasty (four kings) of Nayake origin was from the [[Balija]] caste&lt;ref name="prenayak1"&gt;[[Bangaru Tirumala#Relationship with Kandy Nayaks|Pre-Nayake kings of Kandy (children of Kusuma Devi) and their marriages to south-Indian Nayakes]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}} Even King [[Senarat Adahasin of Sri Lanka|Senarat Adahasin]]'s [[regent]], Antonio Baretto Kuruwita Rala, [[Prince]] of Ouva, was not from the Govi cast&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sjJPZ-TUQzQC&amp;q=antonio+baretto#v=onepage&amp;q=antonio%20baretto&amp;f=false/  Description of the Great and Most Famous Isle of Ceylon, Philip Baldaeus, p. 693-7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/dutch/dutch3.htm Ceylon of the Early Travellers, by H. A. J. Hulugalle (1965); 'Kuruwita Rala, a relative of our last royal Queen']&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest [[Buddhist]] sect in Sri Lanka, the [[Siam Nikaya]] (established on 19 July 1753) are the custodians of the Tooth Relic, since its establishment during the [[Kandyan Kingdom]]. The Siam Nikaya uses caste-based divisions, and as of 1764 grants higher ordination only to the [[Radala]] and Govigama castes, excluding other castes from its numbers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sikhspectrum.com/?s=Search+Sikh+Spectrum Two Great Needs of Buddhists]&lt;/ref&gt; Sitinamaluwe Dhammajoti (Durawa) was the last non-Govigama monk to receive upasampada. This conspiracy festered within the Siam Nikaya itself and Moratota Dhammakkandha, Mahanayaka of Kandy, with the help of the last two Kandyan Telugu Kings victimised the low-country Mahanayaka Karatota Dhammaranma by confiscating the [[Adam's Peak|Sri Pada]] shrine and the retinue villages from the low country fraternity and appointing a rival Mahanayaka&lt;ref&gt;Buddhism in Sinhalese Society, 1750–1900: A Study of Religious Revival and....

=== Current political power ===
Non–Govigama representation in Parliament has steadily declined since independence and representation of non-Govigama castes are well below their population percentages. Caste representation in the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] has always been limited to a few very visible, but unconcerned and disconnected members from a few leading castes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2009/12/fonseka-political-arrivistea-historical.html Fonseka, the political arriviste–a historical irony]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guaraní''' are a group of [[culture|culturally]] related [[indigenous peoples of South America]]. They are distinguished from the related [[Tupí people|Tupí]] by their use of the [[Guaraní language]]. The traditional range of the Guaraní people is in present-day [[Paraguay]] between the [[Uruguay River]] and lower [[Paraguay River]], the [[Misiones Province|Misiones]] Province of [[Argentina]], southern [[Brazil]] once as far north as Rio de Janeiro, and parts of [[Uruguay]] and [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/EthnoAtlas/Hmar/Cult_dir/Culture.7843|title=Society-Guarani|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925035916/http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/EthnoAtlas/Hmar/Cult_dir/Culture.7843|archivedate=2006-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their demographic dominance of the region has been reduced by [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonisation]] and the commensurate rise of [[mestizo]]s, there are contemporary Guaraní populations in these areas. Most notably, the Guaraní language, still widely spoken across traditional Guaraní homelands, is one of the two official languages in Paraguay, the other one being [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.embaparusa.gov.py/paraguay.html |title=Paraguay |publisher=Embassy of Paraguay in the United States of America |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119180538/http://www.embaparusa.gov.py/paraguay.html |archivedate=2009-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language was once looked down upon by the upper and middle classes, but it is now often regarded with pride and serves as a symbol of national distinctiveness.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The Paraguayan population learns Guaraní both informally from social interaction and formally in public schools. In modern Spanish, Guaraní is also applied to refer to any Paraguayan national in the same way that the [[French people|French]] are sometimes called [[Gauls]].

==Name==
The history and meaning of the name ''Guaraní'' are subject to dispute. Prior to their encounter with Europeans, the Guaraní referred to themselves simply as ''Abá'', meaning "men" or "people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07045a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Guaraní was originally applied by early [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries to refer to natives who had accepted conversion to the Christian religion; ''Cayua'' or ''Caingua'' (''ka'aguygua'') was used to refer to those who had refused it. ''Cayua'' is roughly translated as "the ones from the jungle". While the term Cayua is sometimes still used to refer to settlements of indigenous peoples who have not well integrated into the dominant society, the modern usage of the name Guaraní is generally extended to include all people of native origin regardless of societal status. Barbara Ganson writes that the name ''Guaraní'' was given by the Spanish as it means "warrior" in the Tupi-Guaraní dialect spoken there.&lt;ref name=Ganson2003&gt;{{Cite journal  | title = The Guarani Under Spanish Rule in the Rio de la Plata  | year = 2003  | author=Ganson, Barbara  | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guarinĩ'' is attested in 12th-century [[Old Tupi]], by Jesuit sources, as "war, warrior, to wage war, warlord".&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo de Almeida Navarro.  ''Dicionário de tupi antigo.'' {{ISBN|978-85-260-1933-1}}.  Global Editora, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History, myth and legend==
[[File:Cerâmica Tupi-Guarani 5.jpg|thumb|280px|Guarani ceramics.]]
[[File:Triunfo-25.jpg|thumb|280px|Guaraní incised ceramics bowls, Museum Farroupilha, in [[Triunfo, Rio Grande do Sul|Triunfo]].]]
Early Guaraní villages often consisted of communal houses for 10 to 15 families. Communities were united by common interest and language, and tended to form tribal groups by dialect. It is estimated that the Guaraní numbered some 400,000 people when they were first encountered by Europeans. At that time, they were sedentary and agricultural, subsisting largely on [[manioc]], maize, wild game, and [[honey]].

Equally little is known about early Guaraní society and beliefs. They practiced a form of [[animism|animistic]] [[pantheism]], much of which has survived in the form of [[folklore]] and numerous [[myths]]. According to the Jesuit missionary [[Martin Dobrizhoffer]], they practiced [[cannibalism]] at one point, perhaps as a [[funeral|funerary]] ritual, but later disposed of the dead in large jars placed inverted on the ground. [[Guaraní mythology]] is still widespread in rural Paraguay.

Much Guaraní myth and legend was compiled by the [[Universidad Nacional de Misiones]] in northern [[Argentina]] and published as ''Myths and Legends: A journey around the Guarani lands, Anthology'' in 1870 (translated into [[English language]] in 1906). Guaraní myth and legend can roughly be divided into the following broad categories:

* Cosmogonic and eschatological myths; the creation and destruction of all things as dictated by [[Ñamandu]] "the true father, the first one". After him comes a pantheon of gods, chief among them '''Yporú''' who is more frequently known as [[Tupã (mythology)|Tupã]]. [[Jasy]] is another "good" deity who rules the night while [[Aña]] is a malign deity who dwells at the bottom of the [[Iguazu River]].&lt;ref&gt;Salvo, Rosita Escalada; Zamboni, Olga. ''Myths and Legends: A journey around the Guarani lands. Anthology'' (translated by students from the Instituto Superior Lenguas Vivas, 1906), Editorial Universitaria, Universidad Nacional de Misiones, 1870, revised and corrected by Gloria Acosta, 2007. {{ISBN|978-987-9121-99-3}} pp.9-29&lt;/ref&gt;
* Animistic mythology, that is animals, plants and minerals being animated and capable of becoming [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic beings]] or in reverse the transmuted souls of people, either born or unborn, who have become animals, plants and minerals. The course of such anthropomorphism appears dictated by the pantheon of god-like deities because of their virtues or vices. Such animistic legends include that of the [[Lobizón]], a [[werewolf]] type being, and the '''Mainumby''' or [[hummingbird]] who transports good spirits that are resident in flowers back to Tupá "so he can cherish them". '''Isondú''' or [[glowworm]]s are the reincarnated spirits of certain people, as are the '''Panambi''' ([[butterfly|butterflies]]). '''Ka'a Jarýi''' was a woman who became the sacred [[herb]] [[Yerba]]; '''Irupé''' was a woman who was turned into the [[Victoria cruziana|giant lily]] because she fell in love with the moon.&lt;ref name="Salvo, Rosita Escalada 1906 pp.29-63"&gt;Salvo and Zammboni, pp.29-63&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pombero]] are [[goblin]] or [[elf]] like spirits who dwell in the forest and must be appeased. They have never been human. Principal among these is '''Jasy Jatere''' who has never been human and like all Pombero is from a different realm. His characteristics are vague and uncertain, and his powers badly defined as is the place where he resides. He is described in one legend as a "handsome, thickly bearded, blond dwarf" who is naked and lives in tree trunks. Other versions say he loves [[honey]], his feet are backwards, and he is an "ugly, lame, old man". Most legends agree that he snatches children and "licks them", wrapping them in climbing plants or drowning them in rivers. To appease him gifts, such as honey, are left in places in the forest associated with him. Another Pombero is '''Kuarahy Jára''' who whistles like birds and is their protector. He can be your friend but is known for abducting young boys who are alone and trying to catch birds. If necessary he can take the form of a person, a tree or a [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]]. Finally, '''Kurupi''' is a phallic mythological figure who will copulate with young women. He has scaly skin like a lizard, hypnotic eyes, and an enormous [[penis]].&lt;ref name="Salvo, Rosita Escalada 1906 pp.29-63"/&gt;

The sacred [[Iguazu Falls]] hold special significance for the Guaraní and are the inspiration for numerous myths and legends. They reveal the sound of ancient battles at certain times, they are also the place where '''I-Yara'''—a malign Pomboro spirit—abducted '''Angá'''—a fair maiden—and hid her. The [[swallow]]s that inhabit the falls to this day vainly search for her.&lt;ref&gt;Salvo and Zamboni, pp. 63-67&lt;/ref&gt;

===European contact===
In 1537, [[Gonzalo de Mendoza]] traversed through Paraguay to about the present Brazilian frontier. On his return, he made acquaintance with the Guaraní and founded the city of [[Asunción]], later the capital of Paraguay. The first governor of the Spanish territory of [[Guayrá]] initiated a policy of intermarriage between European men and indigenous women; the descendants of these matches characterize the Paraguayan nation today. He also initiated the [[slavery|enslavement]] of the natives.

The first two [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], Father Barcena and Father Angulo, came to what is now the State of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], Southern Brazil, in 1585, by land from the west. Others soon followed, and a Jesuit college was established at Asunción. In 1608, as a result of Jesuit protest against enslavement of the indigenous population, King [[Philip III of Spain]] gave authority to the Jesuits to convert and colonize the tribes of Guayrá. In the early period the name Paraguay was loosely used to designate all the basin of the river, including parts of what are now Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.

Exploring expeditions were accompanied by [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s. Early in the history of Asunción, Father [[Luis de Bolaños]] translated the [[catechism]] into the Guaraní language and preached to Guaraní people who resided in the area around the settlement. In 1588–89 St. [[Francis Solanus]] crossed the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] wilderness from [[Peru]] and stopped at Asunción, but gave no attention to the Guaraní. His departure left the Jesuits alone with their missionary work, and to defend the natives against slave dealers.&lt;ref&gt;"The larger portion of the population regarded it as a right, a privilege by virtue of conquest, that they should enslave the Indians" (Page, 470).&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuit [[provincial (religion)|provincial]] Torres arrived in 1607, and "immediately placed himself at the head of those who had opposed the cruelties at all times exercised over the natives".&lt;ref&gt;Page, 470&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural preservation===

===Slavery===
[[File:Indian Soldiers from the Coritiba Province Escorting Native Prisoners.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Guaraní family captured by slave hunters. By [[Jean Baptiste Debret]]]]
The center depot of the slave trade was the town of [[São Paulo]]. Originally a rendezvous place for [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and Dutch pirates, it later became a refuge for criminals, who mixed with Native American and African women and actively participated in the capturing and selling of Guaranís as slaves.

To oppose these armed and organized robbers, the tribes had only their bows and arrows. Many Guaranís were slain or enslaved by the slave-hunters active in Brazil during those years.

===Jesuit missions===
{{Main|Jesuit Reductions}}
In 1607, Spanish King Philip III sent a letter to the governor of Rio de Plata Hernandarias de Saavedra to instruct him to send the newly arrived Jesuits to begin their missionary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarreal|first1=Julia J.S.|title=The Guarani and Their Missions: A Socioeconomic History|date=2014|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Spanish royal protection, the first Guayrá [[Mission (Christian)|mission]], [[Nuestra Señora de Loreto|Loreto]], was established on the Paranapané by Father Joseph Cataldino and Father Simon Macerata in 1610. The Jesuit priest Father Ruiz de Montoya discussed the difficulties of spreading the missions and his interactions with the Guarani in his book ''The Spiritual Conquest''. Ruiz de Montoya wrote that one of the Guarani caciques Miguel Artiguaye initially refused to join the missions until threatened by another Indigenous group. Artiguaye then returned to the mission and begged for protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montoya|first1=Antonio Ruiz de|title=The Spiritual Conquest: Accomplished by the Religious of the Society of Jesus in the Provinces of Paraguay, Uruguay, and Tape|date=1993|publisher=Institute of Jesuit Sources|location=St. Louis, MO|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the mission provided the only real possible protection against enslavement, the Guaraní flocked there in such numbers that twelve more missions were created in rapid succession, containing in all 40,000 Guaranís. The Jesuits were seen as intermediaries between the Spanish authorities and the Guaraní caciques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ganson|first1=Barbara|title=The Guarani Under Spanish Rule in the Rio de la Plata|date=2003|publisher=Stanford university Press|location=Stanford, CA|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jesuit missions needed new converts and required workers to assist in the maintenance of the missions. The Guaraní helped grow the crops to sustain the missions' populations and also produce goods to sell and trade to fund the missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cushner|first1=Nicholas P.|title=Jesuit Ranches and the Agrarian Development of Colonial Argentina 1650-1767|date=1983|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stimulated by this success, Father [[Roque González y de Santa Cruz|González]] and two companions journeyed to [[Uruguay]] and established two or three small missions in 1627. The local tribes killed the priests and the neophytes and burned the missions.

Slave raiders saw the Guaraní missions as "merely an opportunity of capturing more Indians than usual at a haul".&lt;ref&gt;Graham 57&lt;/ref&gt; In 1629, an army of [[Paulistas]] surrounded the San Antonio mission, set fire to the church and other buildings, killed those who resisted or were too young or too old to travel, and carried the rest into slavery. [[São Miguel das Missões|San Miguel]] and Jesus Maria quickly met the same fate. Eventually, reinforcements gathered by Father Cataldino drove off the slavers. Within two years, all but two of the establishments were destroyed, and 60,000 Christian converts were carried off for sale to [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The attacks usually took place on Sunday, when the whole mission population was gathered for [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. The priests were usually spared, but several were killed.

Only a few thousand natives were left of nearly 100,000 just before the Paulista invasion. Father [[Antonio Ruiz de Montoya]] purchased 10,000 cattle, and was able to convert the natives from farmers to stock raisers. Soon under Fathers Rançoncier and Romero the Uruguay missions were re-established. In 1632 the [[Mameluco]]s discovered a new line of attack from the south. In 1638, despite some successful resistance, all twelve of the missions beyond the Uruguay were abandoned and their people consolidated with the community of the Missions Territory. In the last raid Father Alfaro was killed.

In the same year Father Montoya, after having successfully opposed the attempts of the governor and the [[bishop of Asunción]] to reduce the natives' liberties and the mission administration, sailed for Europe. On this trip he was successful in obtaining letters from [[Pope Urban VIII]] forbidding the enslavement of the missionaries under the severest church penalties, and from King [[Philip IV of Spain]], permitting Guaranís to carry firearms for defense and to be trained in their use by veteran soldiers who had become Jesuits.

When the next Paulista army, 800 strong, attacked the missions in 1641 they were met by a body of Christian Guaraní armed with guns on the [[Acaray River]]. In two battles, the Paulista army suffered a defeat that warded off invasions for ten years. In 1651, the war between Spain and Portugal encouraged another Paulista attack to gain territory for Portugal. Before Spanish troops could arrive to help defend the missions, the fathers themselves led a Guaraní army against the enemy. In 1732, at the time of their greatest prosperity, the Guaraní missions were guarded by a well-drilled and well-equipped army of 7,000 Guaranís. On more than one occasion this mission army, accompanied by their priests, defended the Spanish colony.

In 1732, there were 30 Guaraní missions with 141,252 converted Guaranís.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Two years later a [[smallpox]] epidemic killed approximately 30,000 of them. In 1765, a second outbreak killed approximately 12,000 more, and then spread westward through the [[Gran Chaco people|tribes of the Chaco]].

====Uruguay missions saved====
In 1750, a treaty between Spain and Portugal (the [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)|Treaty of Madrid]]) transferred to Portugal the territory of the seven missions on the Uruguay, and the Guaranís were ordered to leave. They refused to leave, being familiar with the Portuguese as slave-hunters. Seven years of [[guerrilla warfare]] killed thousands of them (see [[Guarani War]]). The Jesuits secured a royal decree restoring the disputed mission territory to Spanish jurisdiction. Two missions in 1747 and a third in 1760 were established in the sub-tribe of the Itatines, or Tobatines, in central Paraguay, far north of the older mission group. In one of these, [[San Joaquín, Paraguay|San Joaquín de los Tobatines]] &lt;small&gt;([[:es:San Joaquín (Paraguay)|es]])&lt;/small&gt; (founded 1747), [[Martin Dobrizhoffer]] ministered for eight years.

====Jesuits expelled====
{{further|Suppression of the Society of Jesus}}
In 1767, the Jesuits were expelled from Spanish dominions by royal edict. Fearing the outcome of this decision, [[viceroy]] [[Antonio María Bucareli y Ursúa]] entrusted the execution of the mandate in 1768 to two officers with a force of 500 troops. Despite their mission army of 14,000, the Jesuits submitted without resistance. Guaraní caciques from Mission San Luis wrote a letter to the Governor of Buenos Aires on February 28, 1768 to ask for the Jesuits to stay. They wrote, "the fathers of the Company of Jesus know how to get along with us, and we with them, we are happy serving God and the King."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ganson|first1=Barbara|title=The Guarani Under Spanish Rule in the Rio de la Plata|date=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guaraní request was denied, but the letter highlights the value of the relationship the Jesuits and Guaraní had established in the region. 

====Decline of the missions====
[[File:Ruins of the São Miguel das Missões.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ruins of the church at [[São Miguel das Missões]], Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.]]
The missions were turned over to priests of other orders, chiefly [[Franciscans]], but under a code of regulations drawn up by the viceroy and modeled largely on the Jesuit system. Under a chaotic political regulation, the missions rapidly declined. Most Guaranís returned to the countryside. According to the official census of 1801, fewer than 45,000 Guaranís remained; cattle, sheep, and horses had disappeared; the fields and orchards were overgrown or cut down, and the churches were in ruins. The long period of revolutionary struggle that followed completed the destruction. In 1814, the mission Indians numbered 8,000, and in 1848 the few who remained were declared citizens.

====Aftermath====
The relationship between the Guaraní and the Jesuits sought to benefit both sides by allowing the Jesuits to grow their missionary presence in the region and giving the Guaraní protections against enslavement. This relationship changed impacted the Guaraní in the years after the Jesuit expulsion. The Guaraní left the missions but some of them didn't go back to the forest or traditional ways. Instead they became what was called "Civilized Indians". Catholics and educated, the Guarani used the knowledge they learned from the Jesuits and became citizens working in various professions. When [[Jean Baptiste Debret]] came to Brazil in early 19th century, he encountered and painted numerous Guaraní in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and the Southeast regions. Debret painted "Merchants in a Street", "A Soldier with two well dressed ladies", "A Wine producer", and "A Rich lady and her servant going to the Church". Debret's depicted wealthy Guaraní living in Rio when the Portuguese Royal Family resided there and it was the capital of the Portuguese Empire. This shows that they influenced and participated in the formation of Brazil as an empire and later as a nation. But their identity as Guaraní has been lost with time and forgotten by its descendants after generations.

A 2018 study in ''The Quarterly Journal of Economics'' found that "in areas of former Jesuit presence—within the Guarani area—educational attainment was higher and remains so (by 10%-15%) 250 years later. These educational differences have also translated into incomes that are 10% higher today. The identification of the positive effect of the Guarani Jesuit missions emerges after comparing them with abandoned Jesuit missions and neighboring Franciscan Guarani missions. The enduring effects observed are consistent with transmission mechanisms of structural transformation, occupational specialization, and technology adoption in agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caicedo|first=Felipe Valencia|title=The Mission: Human Capital Transmission, Economic Persistence, and Culture in South America|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/qje/qjy024/5123742|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|doi=10.1093/qje/qjy024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guaraní people in Bolivia, called Chiriguanos, lived in the foothills of the Andes and had a different history than most other Guaraní people.  Noted for their warlike character, the Chiriguanos were hostile in turn to the [[Inca Empire]], the Spanish, and the independent state of Bolivia from the late 15th to the late 19th century.  The Jesuit missions had little success among the Chiriguanos, although Franciscans in the 19th century attracted numerous converts.  The Chririguanos were not finally pacified until the defeat in 1892 of forces led by their messianic leader [[Apiaguaiki Tumpa]] in the [[Battle of Kuruyuki]].&lt;ref&gt;Langer, Erick D.

The Guaraní people and culture persist. Nearly all the forest tribes on the borders of Paraguay are Guaraní. Many are descendants of mission exiles. In Paraguay, Guaraní lineage predominates in the population and the Guaraní language is spoken in most departments to this day.

The [[Eastern Bolivian Guaraní]] live in southeastern Bolivia near the Paraguayan and Argentine borders, including portions of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]], [[Tarija Department]]s.

==Language==
[[File:Il Guarany Score Front Cover.jpg|thumb|upright|right|300px|Front cover of the play The Guarani by Carlos Gomes]]
{{Main|Guaraní language}}
The [[Guaraní language]] has been much cultivated, its literature covering a wide range of subjects. Many works were written by priests, either wholly or partly in the native language, and were published by the mission press in Loreto. Among the most important treatises on the language are the "Tesoro de la Lengua Guaraní" (Madrid, 1639) by Father Montoya, published in Paris and [[Leipzig]] in 1876; and the "Catecismo de la Lengua Guaraní" of Father Diego Díaz de la Guerra (Madrid, 1630).

The language was also used in other tribes such as the Chaco in Paraguay.

The Guaraní were later described, amongst many other historical documents in existence today, in 1903 by [[Croatia]]n explorers [[Mirko and Stjepan Seljan]]. Several English words can be traced to Guaraní roots, such as "tapioca", "toucan" and "jaguar."

Presently, the language is still the main binding characteristic of the Guaraní people. The Argentinian communities speak mainly [[Mbyá Guaraní language|Mbya-Guaraní]], as opposed to the Tupi-Guaraní and Guaraní-Jopara spoken in Paraguay and Brazil. These varieties are mutually intelligible. The Guaraní villages located in the south of Brazil and in the north of Argentina are more marginalized due to European immigration following the First and Second World Wars. Many Guaraní do not speak Spanish and the European immigrant population does not speak Guaraní. The Mbya-Guaraní still live in secluded villages and only the "[[cacique]]" and some other officials in their community learn Spanish. Recently the government of Argentina has partly financed bilingual schools in the northern province of [[Misiones Province|Misiones]].

Paraguay is a bilingual country and most of its Spanish-speaking population also speaks a form of Guaraní. The Paraguayan population learns Guaraní both informally from social interaction and formally in public schools. Guaraní became part of the required curriculum in public schools during the ten years since the fall of ex-President [[Alfredo Stroessner]] in 1989. The native populations in Paraguay speak the traditional Tupi-Guaraní while the majority of bilingual Paraguayans speak Guaraní-Jopara ("Jopara" meaning mixed). Many words have been borrowed from Spanish but include traditional Tupi-Guaraní prefixes and suffixes. For example, "Nde rentede pa?" meaning "Do you understand?" The "entende" root is borrowed from the Spanish verb "entender" meaning "to understand." The evolution of Guaraní-Jopara is very similar to "Border Spanish" or "Spanglish" where the mixture of the two languages begins to develop its own rules and uses. An understanding of both Guaraní and Spanish is required for full fluency.

In August 2009 Bolivia launched a Guaraní-language university at Kuruyuki in the southeastern province of Chuquisaca which will bear the name of the indigenous hero [[Apiaguaiki Tumpa]]. The education minister of Bolivia said that indigenous universities "will open up not only the Western and universal world of knowledge, but the knowledge of our own identity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boliviaun.org/cms/?p=1158 www.boliviaun.org]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Guaraní had a great cultural influence on the countries they inhabited. In Paraguay the name is used like an ancestral nickname (like the French being called Gauls or the Puerto Ricans being called Boricua). In Brazil there are numerous football teams named Guaraní, also there are one in Paraguay and two in Argentina (both in Misiones). The novel [[The Guarani]] is regarded as a foundational text of Brazilian Romanticism, and has been adapted twice to film. The young leader [[Sepé Tiaraju]] was immortalized by Brazilian writer [[Basílio da Gama]] in the epic poem ''[[O Uraguai]]'' (1769) and in the poem "O Lunar de Sepé", collected by Simões Lopes Neto and published in the beginning of the 20th century. Since then, he has been a character in many major literary works, like "O tempo e o vento" ["The time and the wind"], by Erico Verissimo. The expression and battle cry "''Esta terra tem dono!''" [This land has owners!"] is attributed to Sepé Tiaraju.

[[Santo Ângelo Airport]], in [[Santo Ângelo]], Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, is named after Sepé Tiaraju.
Innumerable streets in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in cities like São Paulo, São Vicente and Côrdoba are named Guaraní.
The Guaraní are depicted in films like'' [[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]'' and ''[[O Tempo e o Vento]]''.

The '''history of [[cancer]]''' describes the development of the field of [[oncology]] and its role in the [[history of medicine]].

==Early diagnoses==
The earliest known descriptions of cancer appear in several papyri from Ancient Egypt. The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] was written around 1600 BC (possibly a fragmentary copy of a text from 2500 BC) and contains a description of cancer, as well as a procedure to remove breast tumours by cauterization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The History of Cancer| url = http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6x_the_history_of_cancer_72.asp| publisher = American Cancer Society| year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippocrates]] (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC) described several kinds of cancer, referring to them by the term ''karkinos'' (''carcinos''), the Greek word for crab or crayfish, as well as ''carcinoma''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bordet.be/en/presentation/history/cancer_e/cancer1.htm |title=The History of Cancer. Institut Jules Bordet (Association Hospitalière de Bruxelles - Centre des Tumeurs de ULB). Retrieved 2010-11-19 |publisher=Bordet.be |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes from the appearance of the cut surface of a solid malignant tumour, with "the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet, whence it derives its name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ralph W. |last=Moss |title=Galen on Cancer |url=http://www.cancerdecisions.com/speeches/galen1989.html |publisher=CancerDecisions |year=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716111312/http://www.cancerdecisions.com/speeches/galen1989.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was against Greek tradition to open the body, Hippocrates only described and made drawings of outwardly visible tumors on the skin, nose, and breasts. Treatment was based on the [[humorism|humor theory]] of four bodily fluids (black and yellow bile, blood, and phlegm). According to the patient's humor, treatment consisted of diet, blood-letting, and/or laxatives.
[[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] (ca. 25 BC - 50 AD) translated ''karkinos'' into ''cancer'', the [[Latin]] word for crab or crayfish.

In the 2nd century AD, the Greek physician [[Galen]] used ''oncos'' (Greek for swelling) to describe all tumours, reserving Hippocrates' term ''carcinos'' for malignant tumours. Galen also used  the suffix ''{{nowrap| -oma}}'' to indicate cancerous lesions. It is from Galen's usage that we derive the modern word [[oncology]].&lt;ref name="Galen"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karpozilos A, Pavlidis N |title=The treatment of cancer in Greek antiquity |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=40 |issue=14 |pages=2033–40 |year=2004 |pmid=15341975 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2004.04.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the centuries it was discovered that cancer could occur anywhere in the body, but Hippocrates' humor-theory based treatment remained popular until the 19th century with the discovery of [[cell (biology)|cells]].

==Modern era==
[[File:A surgical operation to remove a malignant tumour from a man Wellcome V0016861.jpg|thumb|A surgical operation to remove a malignant tumor, 1817]]
In the 16th and 17th centuries, it became more acceptable for doctors to [[autopsy|dissect bodies]] to discover the cause of death. The German professor [[Wilhelm Fabry]] believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct. The Dutch professor [[Francois de la Boe Sylvius]], a follower of [[Descartes]], believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes, and that acidic [[lymph]] fluid was the cause of cancer. His contemporary [[Nicolaes Tulp]] believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads, and concluded that it was [[infectious disease|contagious]].&lt;ref name="Marilyn Yalom"&gt;
[[Marilyn Yalom]] "A history of the breast" 1997. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. {{ISBN|0-679-43459-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first cause of cancer was identified by British surgeon [[Percivall Pott]], who discovered in 1775 that cancer of the [[scrotum]] was a common disease among [[chimney sweep]]s. The work of other individual physicians led to various insights, but when physicians started working together they could draw firmer conclusions.

With the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century, it was discovered that the 'cancer poison' eventually spreads from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites ("[[metastasis]]"). This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon [[Campbell De Morgan]] between 1871 and 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grange JM, Stanford JL, Stanford CA |title=Campbell De Morgan's 'Observations on cancer', and their relevance today |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=296–9 |year=2002 |url=http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/reprint/95/6/296.pdf|pmid=12042378|doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.6.296 |pmc=1279913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[surgery]] to treat cancer had poor results due to problems with hygiene. The renowned Scottish surgeon [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] saw only 2 breast tumor patients out of 60 surviving surgery for two years. In the 19th century, [[asepsis]] improved surgical hygiene and as the [[cancer survivor|survival]] statistics went up, surgical removal of the tumor became the primary treatment for cancer. With the exception of [[William Coley]] who in the late 19th century felt that the rate of cure after surgery had been higher ''before'' asepsis (and who injected bacteria into tumors with mixed results), cancer treatment became dependent on the individual art of the surgeon at removing a tumor. The underlying cause of his results might be that infection stimulates the immune system to destroy left tumor cells. During the same period, the idea that the body was made up of various [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], that in turn were made up of millions of cells, laid rest the humor-theories about chemical imbalances in the body.

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Cancer ad 1938.jpg|thumb|1938 American Society for the Control of Cancer poster.]]
The genetic basis of cancer was recognised in 1902 by the German zoologist [[Theodor Boveri]], professor of [[zoology]] at [[Munich]] and later in [[Würzburg]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal| title = Concerning The Origin of Malignant Tumours| first = Theodor| last = Boveri| year = 2008| journal = [[Journal of Cell Science]]| volume = 121| issue = Supplement 1| pages = 1–84| url = http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/121/Supplement_1/1| doi = 10.1242/jcs.025742| pmid = 18089652}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered a method to generate cells with multiple copies of the [[centrosome]], a structure he discovered and named. He postulated that [[chromosome]]s were distinct and transmitted different inheritance factors. He suggested that mutations of the chromosomes could generate a cell with unlimited growth potential which could be passed on to its descendants. He proposed the existence of cell cycle check points, [[tumour suppressor gene]]s and [[oncogene]]s. He speculated that cancers might be caused or promoted by radiation, physical or chemical insults or by pathogenic microorganisms.

[[File:Cancer add-Restored.jpg|thumb|right|1938 poster identifying surgery, [[x-rays]] and [[radium]] as the proper treatments for cancer.]]

==Therapies==
When [[Marie Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] discovered [[radiation]] at the end of the 19th century, they stumbled upon the first effective non-surgical cancer treatment. With radiation also came the first signs of multi-disciplinary approaches to cancer treatment. The surgeon was no longer operating in isolation, but worked together with hospital radiologists to help patients. The complications in communication this brought, along with the necessity of the patient's treatment in a hospital facility rather than at home, also created a parallel process of compiling patient data into hospital files, which in turn led to the first statistical patient studies.

The [[American Cancer Society]] was founded in 1913 by 15 physicians and businessmen in [[New York City]] under the name ''American Society for the Control of Cancer'' (''ASCC''). The current name was adopted in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;name="charitynavigator.org"&lt;/ref&gt;

A founding paper of cancer epidemiology was the work of [[Janet Lane-Claypon]], who published a comparative study in 1926 of 500 breast cancer cases and 500 control patients of the same background and lifestyle for the British Ministry of Health. Her ground-breaking work on cancer epidemiology was carried on by [[Richard Doll]] and [[Austin Bradford Hill]], who published "[[Lung Cancer]] and Other Causes of Death In Relation to [[Smoking]]. A Second Report on the Mortality of British Doctors" followed in 1956 (otherwise known as the [[British doctors study]]). Richard Doll left the [[London]] Medical Research Center (MRC), to start the [[Oxford]] unit for Cancer epidemiology in 1968. With the use of [[computer]]s, the unit was the first to compile large amounts of cancer data. Modern epidemiological methods are closely linked to current{{When|date=April 2011}} concepts of disease and [[public health]] policy. Over the past 50&amp;nbsp;years, great efforts have been spent on gathering data across medical practice, hospital, provincial, state, and even country boundaries to study the interdependence of environmental and cultural factors on cancer incidence.

Cancer patient treatment and studies were restricted to individual physicians' practices until [[World War II]], when medical research centers discovered that there were large international differences in disease incidence. This insight drove national public health bodies to enable the compilation of health data across practices and hospitals, a process found in many countries today. The Japanese medical community observed that the bone marrow of victims of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] was completely destroyed. They concluded that diseased [[bone marrow]] could also be destroyed with radiation, and this led to the development of bone marrow transplants for [[leukemia]]. Since World War II, trends in cancer treatment are to improve on a micro-level the existing treatment methods, standardize them, and globalize them to find cures through [[epidemiology]] and international partnerships.

In 1968 [[Anthony Epstein]], [[Bert Achong]] and [[Yvonne Barr]] identified the first [[human cancer virus]], called the [[Epstein-Barr Virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Epstein MA, Achong BG, Barr YM |title=Virus Particles in Cultured Lymphoblasts from Burkitt's Lymphoma |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=7335 |pages=702–3 |date=March 1964 |pmid=14107961 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(64)91524-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War on Cancer==
{{main article|War on Cancer}}
The political 'war' on cancer began with the [[National Cancer Act of 1971]], a [[United States federal law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/timeline/noflash/milestones/M4_Nixon.htm| title=Milestone (1971): National Cancer Act of 1971| work=Developmental Therapeutics Program Timeline| publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]| accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The act was intended "to amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] so as to strengthen the [[National Cancer Institute]] in order to more effectively carry out the national effort against [[cancer]]".
It was signed into law by then [[Richard Nixon|U.S. President Richard Nixon]] on December 23, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://legislative.cancer.gov/history/phsa/1971| title=National Cancer Act, Legislative History| work=Office of Government and Congressional Relations| publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]| accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, cancer research led to a [[cold war]] incident,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.sunypress.edu/p-133-a-conspiracy-of-cells.aspx | title = A Conspiracy of Cells: One Woman's Immortal Legacy and the Medical Scandal It Caused | last = Gold | first = Michael | isbn = 978-0-88706-099-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; where co-operative samples of reported [[oncovirus]]es were discovered to be contaminated by [[HeLa]].

In 1984, [[Harald zur Hausen]] discovered first HPV16 and then HPV18 responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers.  For discovery that human papillomaviruses ([[HPV]]) cause human cancer, zur Hausen won a 2008 [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2008/hausen-autobio.html |title=Harald zur Hausen - Autobiography |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1971 the [[United States]] has invested over $200 billion on cancer research; that total includes money invested by public and private sectors and foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sharon Begley | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/157548/page/2 |title=Rethinking the War on Cancer |date=2008-09-16 | work=Newsweek |accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this substantial investment, the country has seen just a five percent decrease in the cancer death rate (adjusting for size and age of the population) between 1950 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/health/policy/24cancer.html |title=Advances Elusive in the Drive to Cure Cancer |last=Kolata|first=Gina|authorlink=Gina Kolata|date=April 23, 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer life expectancy may be a contributing factor to this, as cancer rates and mortality rates increases significantly with age, more than three out of five cancers are diagnosed in people aged 65 and over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/incidence/age/ |title=Cancer incidence by age |publisher=Cancer Research UK |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The quotation marks and em-dash are part of the story's title --&gt;
'''''"If This Goes On—"''''' is a [[science fiction]] novella by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]], first serialized in 1940 in [[Astounding (magazine)|''Astounding Science-Fiction'']] and revised and expanded for inclusion in the 1953 collection ''[[Revolt in 2100]]''. The novella shows what might happen to Christianity in the United States given mass communications, applied psychology, and a hysterical populace. The novel is part of Heinlein's [[Future History (novel)|''Future History'']] series.

In 2016 the story won the 1941 [[Hugo Award|Retro-Hugo Award]] for Best Novella of 1940 at the 2016 WorldCon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1941-retro-hugo-awards/ 1941 Retro-Hugos] at the Hugo Awards website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The story is set in a future [[theocratic]]  American society, ruled by the latest in a series of fundamentalist Christian "Prophets". The First Prophet was Nehemiah Scudder, a backwoods preacher turned [[President of the United States|President]] (elected in 2012), then [[dictator]] (no elections were held in 2016 or later).

John Lyle, a junior army officer under the Prophet, is stationed at the Prophet's capital of [[New Jerusalem#In popular culture|New Jerusalem]]. Devout at this point, he finds himself questioning his faith when he falls for one of the Prophet's Virgins, Sister Judith. Judith, new to the vocation, faints when she is called upon to render sexual service to the Prophet and is confined to her quarters until she sees the light. John confides in his far more worldly roommate, Zeb Jones, who is not only not shocked, but who assists John. A clandestine meeting with Judith goes awry when they are forced to kill a spy, leaving them no choice but to seek aid from the Cabal, an underground revolutionary movement (Judith's friend, Sister Magdalene, is a member). The two men are inducted into the Cabal, while remaining on duty in their army posts. Judith is arrested and tortured as part of the investigation into the death of the spy, and John and Zeb rescue her, though leaving enough clues that John is soon arrested and tortured himself. He gives little away, and is himself rescued by the Cabal. Zeb and Magdalene have evaded arrest, thanks to a clandestine distress signal that John manages to leave for Zeb while being arrested.

Judith is spirited out of the country before John regains consciousness, and John is given a false identity in order to make his way to Cabal headquarters. He is detected en route, forced to flee, and arrives safely after several misadventures. He finds that Zeb and Magdalene, who he assumes are a couple, have made their way there before him. All take on significant roles in bringing to fruition the revolutionary plot, John as an aide to the commander, General Huxley.

While working there, John receives a literal [[Dear John letter|"Dear John" letter]] from Judith, informing him of her impending marriage to a Mexican man she met while getting refuge in his country. He learns that Zeb and Magdalene have no marriage plans, and begins a romance with Magdalene.

The revolutionary plot is mostly successful, and the country, other than New Jerusalem, is seized. But the capital must also be conquered lest it serve as a rallying point for loyalists. Even as constitutional discussions go on, tempered to provide the greatest possible individual freedom (this is the origin of the 'Covenant' mentioned in other Heinlein works), the new regime's troops prepare to take New Jerusalem. John and Magdalene are married just before the assault.

During the fight, Huxley is wounded, and John must take over temporary command, though not entitled by rank to do so. He gives the orders that bring victory. He then turns over command to the senior unwounded general, and leads a squad invading the Prophet's private quarters. They find that he has been viciously killed by his own Virgins.

==Freemasonry==
The Cabal uses terminology associated with [[Freemasonry]], and there are hints that the Masons are actually one of the groups involved in the loosely organized revolt against the government. (Heinlein himself was not a Mason,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heinleinsociety.org/rah/FAQrah.html FAQ: Heinlein the Person&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but had considered joining the Masons as a young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.arts.sf.written/r8ezDGQDfMM/R-jJIVm6HbEJ|title=Re: Heinlein and freemasonry?|date=October 13, 2006|author=Bill Patterson|newsgroup=rec.arts.sf.written|message-id=1155484574.561507.148190@m79g2000cwm.googlegroups.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Critical reception==
[[Damon Knight]] wrote of the novel:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Damon|year=1967|title=[[In Search of Wonder]]|location=Chicago|publisher=Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Revolution...has always been a favorite theme in science fiction.  It's romantic, it's reliable, and—as a rule—it's as phony as a Martian princess.

Who but Heinlein ever pointed out, as he does here in detail, that a modern revolution is big business?  And who but Heinlein would have seen that fraternal organizations, for thirty years the butt of highbrow American humor, would make the perfect nucleus for an American underground against tyranny?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Connections with other works by Heinlein==
While set in Heinlein's ''Future History'', the story is self-contained and has little connection with other works in the series. However, it is noted in ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'' that, during the time of this story, the secret of the Howard Families was held close (being a prize that was beyond the power of the Prophet to confiscate), and also that the Cabal assisted in helping the Howards maintain their Masquerade, the concealment of the existence of the Howards. [[Lazarus Long]] specifically mentions that he spent the period of the Interregnum, when the Prophets ruled the United States and space travel was forbidden, mostly on Venus.

The story also depicts the start of the negotiations which would lead to the Covenant, the somewhat idealized basis for government depicted in "[[Coventry (short story)|Coventry]]", "[[Misfit (short story)|Misfit]]" and in ''Methuselah's Children''.

Scudder was previously mentioned in passing in the short story "[[Logic of Empire]]" and later on in Heinlein’s final novel ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]''. A story about the rise of Scudder, "The Sound of His Wings", is contained in the Future History timeline, but was never written by Heinlein, who stated in the afterword to ''Revolt in 2100'': "I will probably never write the story of Nehemiah Scudder, I dislike him too much". Also, a story called "The Stone Pillow", which would have depicted the earlier foredoomed opposition to the Theocracy, never got written, Heinlein noting that there was "too much tragedy in real life".

The 1940 version of ''"If This Goes On—"'' was believed to be Heinlein's first novel&lt;ref&gt;# {{cite journal

 | title = A Study of ‘If This Goes On—’ | journal=The Heinlein Journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the unpublished work ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'' was discovered in 2003.&lt;ref name="rule20030831"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heinleinsociety.org/newsFUTL.html | title=The finding and publishing of "For Us, the Living" | publisher=The Heinlein Society | date=2003-08-31 | accessdate=March 6, 2012 | author=Rule, Deb Houdek}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the earlier, unpublished novel Scudder, though coming very close to gaining power, is stopped at the last moment by the mobilization of Libertarians.

Ward Carson wrote: "In ''For Us, The Living'', space colonization waits until the end of the Twenty-First Century and Scudder is defeated; in the ''Future History'' it happens a century earlier and Scudder takes over the US. Heinlein made no explicit remark on this, but a causal connection could be made: in the Future History the bold individualistic Americans emigrated into space in the end of the Twentieth Century, and were not present in America to stop it from falling into the fanatic's hands".&lt;ref&gt;Ward G. Carson, "The Formative Years of Science Fiction" in Ed Woods (ed.) ''Round Table on Speculative Literature'', London, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Folta's laboratory has two primary research areas: [[photomorphogenesis|controlling plant traits using light]], and using genomics to identify molecular markers for key fruit-plant traits.

=== Plants and light ===
Folta's work with light began in 1987, while working with genes associated with the [[phytochrome]] response in plants. This research resulted in the discovery that exposure to blue light mediates specific gene responses and physiology in the plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' through [[cryptochrome]] and [[phototropin]] receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=The Plant Journal | volume=6 | issue=5 | pages=471–478 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01038.x | last1=Folta | first1=Kevin M. | last2=Spalding | first2=Edgar P. | title=Unexpected roles for cryptochrome 2 and phototropin revealed by high-resolution analysis of blue light-mediated hypocotyl growth inhibition. | date=2001 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01038.x/full | accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Folta has continued this work to explore new findings in how plants grow and move in green-enriched environments, which are the challenging conditions in which plants have to grow while under the shade of other plants, and the unusual effects this produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=EurekAlert! | url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-01/ajob-sjf010213.php | title=Scientists join forces to bring plant movement to light | author=American Journal of Botany | date=2 January 2013 | accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in plant biology would later extend to using [[light emitting diodes]] (LEDs) to control specific attributes of plants, such as quality, flavor, aroma, nutrition, and texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.futurity.org/fruit-could-taste-better-with-far-red-light/ | work=Futurity | title=Fruit Could Taste Better With Far-Red Light | last=Anderson-Florida | first=Mickie | date=24 July 2013 | accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decoded" /&gt; On this, Folta says that each plant's genetic makeup gives it a certain genetic potential that can be altered by selection or genetic modification, but how this potential is reached depends on environmental conditions that can be manipulated through [[photomorphogenesis]]. He says this depends entirely on how genes that are responsible for controlling the plant's growth are activated or deactivated in response to light.&lt;ref name="Decoded"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.decodedscience.org/controlling-plants-light-leds-change-plant-growth/39190 | title=Controlling Plants with Light: LEDs to Change Plant Growth | work=Decoded Science | last=Latchman | first=David | date=19 November 2013 | accessdate=2 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folta believes this research would be of interest to farmers wanting to get the most genetic potential out of their crops without the need for chemicals or genetic modification,&lt;ref name="Decoded" /&gt; and he believes his research involving red and far-red light could be used on postharvest fruits to improve their flavor while stored in grocery stores and home refrigerators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news/2013-07-flavor-scent-volatiles-fruits.html | title=Light can change flavor, scent volatiles in plants and fruits, study finds | author=[[University of Florida]] | work=[[Phys.org]] | date=23 July 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strawberry genomics and flavors ===
Folta's work in [[strawberry]] genomics began in 2002.&lt;ref name="ufgi"&gt;{{cite web | title=Sharing science: Kevin Folta’s career in horticulture, research advocacy | url=http://ufgi.ufl.edu/sharing-science-kevin-foltas-career-in-horticulture-research-advocacy/ | first=Ellison | last=Langford |  work=University of Florida Genetics Institute | date=28 September 2015 | accessdate=28 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Folta was the contributing author in sequencing the strawberry genome in 2011.&lt;ref name="ufgi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShulaevSargent2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shulaev|first1=Vladimir|display-authors=et al. |title=The genome of woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca)|journal=Nature Genetics|volume=43|issue=2|year=2011|pages=109–116|issn=1061-4036|doi=10.1038/ng.740|pmid=21186353|pmc=3326587}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the project, they discovered molecular markers that speed traditional breeding for enhanced flavors.&lt;ref name="ufgi"/&gt;

Folta's more recent work with strawberries has involved identifying the compounds responsible for taste that are present in different varieties of the fruit in order to breed these characteristics back into commercial varieties; characteristics which have been lost over time due to strawberries having been bred, traditionally, to select for disease resistance, firmness, size, and yield instead of flavor.&lt;ref name="LS 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/10932-future-flavor-strawberry-genetic-code-sequenced.html | title=The Future of Flavor: Strawberry's Genetic Code Sequenced | work=[[LiveScience]] | last=Parry | first=Wynne | date=26 December 2010 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/bland-strawberries-genetic-tweak-flavor-204757153.html | title=Bland Strawberries Get a Genetic Tweak for Flavor | work=[[Yahoo!

== Science communication ==
[[File:Kevin Folta.jpg|thumb|[[The Amaz!ng Meeting]] 8 in 2010]]
Folta has formal training in communication and has been recognized for his skill by scholarly institutions.&lt;ref name="TB bio" /&gt; He uses his experience to provide workshops to teach scientists and farmers how to communicate science effectively, and engages with the public through outreach programs, the internet, and other means.&lt;ref name="TB bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.talkingbiotech.com/instructor/ | work=Talking Biotech (blog) | title=Instructor — Talking Biotech | accessdate=28 October 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220233020/http://www.talkingbiotech.com/instructor/ | archivedate=20 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"/&gt;

''[[Nature Biotechnology]]'' described Folta as "a gifted communicator—one of the rare scientists who has engaged the public, with over 12 years experience behind him. Not someone who merely discusses public engagement; but someone who actually communicates directly with non-expert audiences—at science fairs, in schools, at retirement homes, in blogs and podcasts."&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"/&gt;

In 2016, Folta was awarded the [[Borlaug CAST Communication Award]] by the [[Council for Agricultural Science and Technology]] (CAST), named after fellow agricultural biologist and 1970 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Norman Borlaug]]. CAST cited Folta's ability to focus on "clear, credible information" and his use of multiple venues to engage the public, in addition to his communication workshops for scientists and farmers. Julie Borlaug, daughter of Norman Borlaug, added, "[Folta] has not shied away from controversial subjects and has often been the number one target of the anti-science movement on behalf of all of us who support biotechnology."&lt;ref name=CAST/&gt; Writing about the award in ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'', Jack Payne, University of Florida's senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources and leader of the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, praised Folta for his dedication to science communication and willingness to speak to all audiences about food biotechnology. Payne wrote that Folta "wants to replace fear with fact" to counteract misinformation about biotechnology and its use in food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Payne|first1=Jack|title=Good science conquers greatest fear: the unknown|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/10/11/good-science-conquers-greatest-fear-unknown/91911900/|website=The DesMoines Register|publisher=USA Today Network|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folta has considered his outreach efforts among his proudest achievements, and stated that his most important contributions to science "won't come out of my lab. They'll come out of my mouth."&lt;ref name="ufgi"/&gt;

Folta has been active in the public discussion of politically controversial topics such as evolution, climate change, vaccines, and agricultural biotechnology since 2002.&lt;ref name="HuffPo bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-folta/ | work=[[Huffington Post]] | title=Kevin Folta | accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/gm-crop-opponents-expand-probe-into-ties-between-scientists-and-industry-1.18146 | title=GM-crop opponents expand probe into ties between scientists and industry | work=Nature | date=6 August 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | author=Kloor, Keith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other sources:

From being able to manipulate viruses to attack cancer, to precision-change genetic information in a cell, to tweaking a gene and making a crop immune to a disease—breakthroughs like this are real and gaining momentum."&lt;ref name=Gerbic2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|title=This is Genetic Engineering 2.0|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/this_is_genetic_engineering_2.0|accessdate=17 November 2017|work=Skeptical Inquirer|issue=July/August 2017|publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has compared the [[scientific consensus]] regarding the safety of [[genetically modified organisms|genetically modified foods]] to those regarding [[global warming]] and [[vaccine]]s.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/anti-gmo-activist-seeks-expose-emails-food-scientists/ | title=Anti-GMO Activist Seeks to Expose Scientists' Emails With Big Ag | work=Wired | date=23 February 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | last=Levinovitz |  first=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an outspoken critic of food blogger [[Vani Hari]]'s claims about the alleged dangers of certain food additives that regulators generally recognize as safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/the-food-babe-enemy-of-chemicals/385301/ | title=The Food Babe: Enemy of Chemicals | work=The Atlantic | date=11 February 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | author=Hamblin, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folta advocates for a "soft and effective" approach in handling anti-GMO activists, believing overly inflammatory responses from the scientific community will alienate the public audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title="Fear mongers" make good living by misrepresenting science, says GMO expert | url=http://publications.mcgill.ca/reporter/2015/09/fear-mongers-make-a-good-living-off-of-misrepresenting-science-says-gmo-expert/ | accessdate=23 September 2015 | work=[[McGill Reporter]] | date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folta regards the term "GMO" as imprecise and not as descriptive as the term "genetic engineering".&lt;ref name="GerbicCSICOP2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|authorlink=Susan Gerbic|title=The Challenges of Science Communication: An Interview with Kevin Folta|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_challenges_of_science_communication_an_interview_with_kevin_folta|website=CSICOP.org|accessdate=26 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042104/http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_challenges_of_science_communication_an_interview_with_kevin_folta|archivedate=8 November 2016|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His supportive view is also expressed in an interview at CSICon made by Jonathan Jarry, recalling Kevin Folta's  recent visit to Uganda where he saw Ugandan scientists using genetic engineering to solve a food crisis, although initially being denied the use of this technology. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jonathan|first1=Jarry|title=An interview with Kevin Folta at CSICon|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_interview_with_kevin_folta_at_csicon|website=Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP)|publisher=CSICOP, an independent nonprofit organization|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of the importance of public education, Folta says of the changes in crop technology: "Gene editing is this method of changing a single base (or maybe a few bases) of targeted DNA in an amazingly precise way. And unlike the old methods of genetic engineering that left some of the hardware of the process in the cell, the new methods can yield tiny alterations that solve a problem with a precision change. While scientists celebrate the technology and see it as a way to precision-breed new plants and animals, activists call it the most 'dangerous and insidious form of screwing with nature known to man'."&lt;ref name=Gerbic2017 /&gt;

===Podcasting===
Folta operates the ''Talking Biotech'' [[podcast]] which is billed as "A science-based assessment of new technology and the future of food",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Genome Center Director features in ‘Talking Biotech’ podcast | website=UC Davis Genome Center | url=http://genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/2015/07/29/genome-center-director-features-in-talking-biotech-podcast/ | accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he interviews agriculture scientists and experts in the fields of science and communication to discuss the genetic improvement of plants, animals, and microbes and other issues in biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website=Talking Biotech Podcast | url=http://www.talkingbiotechpodcast.com | title=Talking Biotech Podcast - Evidence-Based Discussion with Dr. Kevin Folta | accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also created the ''Science Power Hour'' podcast, which is a [[parody]] of an [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] [[talk radio]] show hosted by Folta's alter ego "Vern Blazek". Folta describes the show as an attempt to deliver science communication in an entertaining way that would appeal to a more general audience, and as a way to convey serious topics using humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is VB?|url=http://www.sciencepowerhour.com/?page_id=124|website=sciencepowerhour.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seed Money|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/brookeborel/when-scientists-email-monsanto|accessdate=1 February 2016|publisher=buzzfeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflict of interest allegations ==
In February 2015, US Right to Know (USRTK), an [[Oakland, California]]-based group whose sole major funder is the [[Organic Consumers Association]],&lt;ref name="Kloor"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Keith Kloor | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scientific-community/2015/02/agricultural-researchers-rattled-demands-documents-group-opposed-gm | title=Updated: Agricultural researchers rattled by demands for documents from group opposed to GM foods | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=11 February 2015 | accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed a [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request to the University of Florida as part of a campaign targeting the emails of public scientists who have spoken out in favor of [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; USRTK was concerned that scientists such as Folta may have been pressured by food and agricultural companies into claiming that GMOs are safe.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The university released documents which indicated that Folta had not committed any [[scientific misconduct]].&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; Folta told ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that he was willing to comply, but was concerned with how USRTK would use the information and how his emails could be taken out of context and used to "smear" him.&lt;ref name="Kloor"/&gt;

In a ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' article from August 2015 [[Keith Kloor]] wrote that Folta had "close ties to [[Monsanto]] and other biotechnology interests".&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; Folta denied these claims,&lt;ref name=ihe&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/14/researcher-finds-himself-center-battle-over-gmos-and-corporate-support | title=Casualty of GMO Wars | work=Inside Higher Education | date=14 August 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | author=Flaherty, Colleen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote that the accusation was based on a few dozen emails, three professional direct interactions over thirteen years, and a reimbursement of customary travel expenses by Monsanto for $719.76, covering airfare, a rental car, 2 hotel nights, and parking for one event to speak to farmers in Colorado in September 2014.&lt;ref name=kfolta&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kfolta.blogspot.com/2015/09/what-are-deep-ties-to-monsanto.html| title= What are "Deep Ties" to Monsanto? | work=Illumination (blog)| date=13 September 2015 | accessdate=13 September 2015 | author=Folta, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=s20&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.science20.com/kevin_folta/setting_a_new_standard_for_science_transparency-157244 | title= Setting A New Standard For Science Transparency | work=Science 2.0 | date=22 September 2015 | accessdate=22 September 2015 | author=Folta, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville/&gt; Folta has maintained that he has always communicated information consistently according to his research and understanding as a scientist working for a public institution.&lt;ref name=ihe/&gt;

In September 2015, [[Eric Lipton]] writing for the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that the agriculture industry had enlisted academics, including Folta, to use their "independent voices" to advocate for public perception and policy, which appeared favorable to the industry.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/us/food-industry-enlisted-academics-in-gmo-lobbying-war-emails-show.html | title=Food Industry Enlisted Academics in G.M.O.

Folta submitted expense reports to use the biotechnology communication fund to pay for travel expenses, a small projector, coffee and food.&lt;ref name=kfolta/&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20150828/articles/150829661 |title= UF to donate Monsanto funds to food pantry | work=Gainesville Sun | date=28 August 2015 | accessdate=10 September 2015 | author=Schweers, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these expenses had since been reimbursed to the fund with honoraria from his talks and private donations from individuals and small businesses, while none of the donation from Monsanto was used.&lt;ref name=s20/&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville/&gt; In response to the controversy and personal threats against Folta and his family, the university offered to return the donation, which Monsanto refused; instead, funds were redirected to a university food pantry.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville/&gt;&lt;ref name=tampa/&gt; Folta has promised a complete accounting for his research and extension activities, which he says "defines a new standard of transparency and a new tool to cultivate trust" he hopes other scientists and advocates will adopt.&lt;ref name=s20/&gt;

In October 2015, ''[[Nature Biotechnology]]'' wrote that scientists like Folta have been "targeted because they speak inconvenient truths about GM technology" and stated that the funds "were tied neither to [Folta] directly nor to his research. His conflict of interest disclosures were wholly compliant with his university's rules. He never used industry funds for personal gain." The journal criticized the journalists for "[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picking]]" and creating "hostile environments [for scientists] that threaten vibrant rare species with extinction."&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Nature Biotechnology]]| department=Editorial| title=Standing up for science | year=2015| issue=10| volume=33| pages=1009| publisher=Nature Publishing Group| url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3384| accessdate=10 October 2015| doi=10.1038/nbt.3384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experts were highly critical of the move by USRTK. Jack Payne, head of the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, characterized this as an example of activist groups attempting to silence scientists who wish to engage in public discussion of politically controversial topics, describing it as a "[[spiral of silence]]".&lt;ref name=tampa&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/perspective/perspective-records-requests-hijack-scientists-time/2245131 | title=Perspective: Records requests hijack scientists' time| work= Tampa Bay Times | date=12 September 2015 | accessdate=12 September 2015 | author=Payne, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretchen Goldman, writing for the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS), a nonprofit science advocacy organization, criticized the FOIA requests for being "overly wide", saying it would create "chilling effects on researchers and confuse the public about the state of the science."&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.ucsusa.org/gretchen-goldman/no-scientist-should-face-harassment-period-637| title=No Scientist Should Face Harassment.

Professor and science communicator [[Steven Novella]] wrote that "The shill witch hunt is just getting started, and now they are emboldened by the PR bonanza they have found in FOIA requests for e-mails. All of this is likely to have a chilling effect on scientists speaking out in the public square on controversial issues."&lt;ref name="neurologica"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/how-to-attack-a-public-scientist/ | title=How To Attack a Public Scientist| work=Neurologica (blog) | date=11 September 2015 | accessdate=11 September 2015 | author=Novella,Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Koyraboro Senni''' (or '''Eastern Songhay''', '''Koroboro Senni''', '''Koyra Senni''') is a member of the [[Songhay languages]] of [[Mali]] and is spoken by some 400,000 people along the [[Niger River]] from the town of [[Gourma-Rharous]], east of [[Timbuktu]], through [[Bourem]], [[Gao]] and [[Ansongo]] to the Mali–[[Niger]] border.

The expression "''koyra-boro senn-i''" denotes "the language of the town dwellers", as opposed to [[nomad]]s like the [[Tuareg people]] and other [[transhumance|transhumant]] people.

Although Koyraboro Senni is associated with settled towns, it is a cosmopolitan language which has spread east and west of Gao, to the [[Fula people]] living at the Mali–Niger border and to the [[Bozo people]] of the Niger River. East of Timbuktu, Koyra Senni gives way relatively abruptly to the closely related [[Koyra Chiini language|Koyra Chiini]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7482">'''Let Books Be Books''' was founded in March 2014 as a campaign to persuade publishers of children’s books to stop labelling and promoting books as 'for boys' or 'for girls'. The campaign, which is led by parents and traces its origins to a [[Conversation threading|thread]] on the on-line forum [[Mumsnet]], is a spin-off of the [[Let toys be toys|Let Toys be Toys]] campaign, which seeks to get toy manufactures to stop gendering their products.&lt;ref name="BBC 17 March 2014" &gt;{{cite news |last= Masters |first= Tim |title= Campaign over gender-specific books gains support |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26612080|accessdate=24 November 2014 |website= BBC News |date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its founding statement, the campaign said: “Children are listening, and take seriously the messages they receive from books, from toys, from marketing and the adults around them. Do we really want them to believe that certain things are off-limits for them because of their gender? They’re not ‘getting it wrong’ if a girl likes robots, or if a boy wants to doodle flowers. […] It’s time that publishers Let Books Be Books and leave children free to choose their interests for themselves”.&lt;ref name="Let Books Be Books launch" &gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/time-to-let-books-be-books/|title= Time to Let Books Be Books|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=5 March 2014 |website= www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk |accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from authors==
Prominent authors supporting the Let Books Be Books campaign include former and current [[Children%27s Laureate|children's laureates]] [[Anne Fine]] and [[Malorie Blackman]], the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|poet laureate]] [[Carol-Ann Duffy]], and [[Philip Pullman]].&lt;ref name="BBC 17 March 2014" /&gt; 

Anne Fine told UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"You'd think this battle would have been won decades ago. But even some seemingly bright and observant adults are buying into it again […] There are girls of all sorts, with all interests, and boys of all sorts with all interests. Just meeting a few children should make that obvious enough. But no, these idiotic notions are spouted so often they become a self-fulfilling societal straitjacket from which all our children suffer".&lt;ref name="Guardian 7 March 2014" &gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/07/parents-gender-boys-girls-books-let-books-be-books|title= Parents push to end gender division of boys' and girls' books |last=Flood|first=Alison |date=7 March 2014 |website=www.theguardian.com | accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   

Also speaking to ''The Guardian'', Pullman, author of the ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy, said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I'm against anything, from age-ranging to pinking and blueing, whose effect is to shut the door in the face of children who might enjoy coming in. No publisher should announce on the cover of any book the sort of readers the book would prefer. Let the readers decide for themselves".&lt;ref name="Guardian 7 March 2014" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Response from publishers==
In the week following the campaign's launch, [[Parragon| Parragon Books]] responded on [[Twitter]], tweeting: "Feedback on gender-specific titles is important to us. We have no plans to create new titles referring to boy/girl in the UK".&lt;ref name="BBC 17 March 2014" /&gt; In the same week, publisher [[Usborne Publishing|Usborne]] announced that a plan to "discontinue publication of titles such as these was decided some time ago”, adding that the company took "feedback on gender-specific titles very seriously” and that it had "no plans to produce any titles labelled 'for girls' or 'for boys' in the future".&lt;ref name="Guardian 7 March 2014" /&gt;

On Sunday 16 March, the literary editor of the UK newspaper the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'', Katy Guest, announced: &lt;blockquote&gt;”Gender-specific books demean all our children. […] So I promise now that the newspaper and this website will not be reviewing any book which is explicitly aimed at just girls, or just boys. Nor will ''The Independent’''s books section. And nor will the children’s books blog at independent.co.uk”.&lt;ref name="Independent on Sunday 16 March 2014" &gt;{{cite news |last= Guest  |first= Katy |title= Gender-specific books demean all our children. So the Independent on Sunday will no longer review anything marketed to exclude either sex |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/genderspecific-books-demean-all-our-children-so-the-independent-on-sunday-will-no-longer-review-anything-marketed-to-exclude-either-sex-9194694.html|accessdate=24 November 2014 |newspaper=The Independent on Sunday |location=London |date=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Michael O'Mara, owner of [[Michael_O%27Mara_Books|Buster Books]] defended his company’s gender-specific titles, such as ''The Beautiful Girls' Colouring Book'' and ''The Brilliant Boys' Colouring Book'', to ''The Independent on Sunday'' in March 2014, saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;”It's a fact of life how a very large percentage of people shop when buying for kids, do it by sex. We know for a fact that when they are shopping on Amazon, they quite often type in 'books for boys' and 'books for girls’”.&lt;ref name="Independent on Sunday 16 March 2014" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2014, [[Ladybird Books]] signed up to the Let Books Be Books campaign and announced that it was "committed" to avoiding gendered titles and would be removing such labelling in reprinted copies. The publisher added: "Out of literally hundreds of titles currently in print, we actually only have six titles with this kind of titling". Its parent company, Penguin Random House Children’s division, will also be following suit.&lt;ref name="Guardian 20 November 2014" &gt;{{cite web |last=Flood |first=Alison |title= Ladybird drops branding books ‘for boys’ or ‘for girls’ |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/20/ladybird-drops-branding-books-for-boys-girls-childrens |accessdate=24 November 2014 |website=www.theguardian.com |date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 21 November 2014" &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-30143662|title=Ladybird drops gender-specific children's book titles|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=21 November 2014 |website=BBC News | accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other publishers who have informed Let Books Be Books that they will no longer be publishing gender-specific titles include [[Dorling Kindersley]], [[Chad Valley (toy brand)|Chad Valley]] and [[Miles Kelly Publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/more-publishers-agree-to-let-books-be-books/#more-3484|title=More publishers agree to Let Books Be Books|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 November 2014|website= www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk | accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Masubia''' are the largest tribe in [[Caprivi Strip]] whose traditional authority (''kuta'') is based in [[Bukalo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caprivi.biz/people.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
They Masubia originate from Central Africa. In Southern Africa they first settled in the [[Goha Hills]] of Botswana. Due to the tribal conflicts in Botswana,{{when|date=July 2013}} they moved to the great Caprivi. In that region they erected their headquarters in Bukalo under the leadership of the first Masubia king, [[King Sanjo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://arroukatchee.fr/eng/namibia/people/caprivians.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of the [[Lozi people|Lozi]] of Zambia and the [[Kololo]] of South Africa between the 17th and 18th century led to the current blend of cultures, language and traditions. 

==Ways of life==
They live off farming and gathering, hunting and fishing. The women are responsible for farming activities while the men deal with the hunting and fishing. Their staple food is hard porridge ''(inkoko)'' with fish or sour milk ''(masanza)''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Villages==
The Masubia villages are called ''minzi''. The homes consist of huts made up of a mud wall and thatch roof or houses with concrete walls and sheet metal roofs. The huts are surrounded by a reed fence known as ''ilapa''. The villages often consist of 15 to 30 families.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. 

Nkuhaane village names are given in accordance or with consideration to major life events that took place or were believed to have taken place in that area such as &lt;ref&gt;"ciwongo ca masaku" an isolated peace of land which was and is still believed to be a place where ghosts live/d.&lt;/ref&gt;
the main villages of the nkuhaane people are, Ibbu, Mahundu, Vuruha, Mutikitila, Ngala, Mbalasinte, Ciseke ca banyai, Ioma, Bbwaara, Cizungwe and Iseke.

==Religion==
Masubia religion is based on [[ancestor worship]], wherein the deceased ancestors are regarded as guardian spirits. Those who do not honor nor show respects to these spirits are punished. They believe that these spirits have a connection with the Creator, and serve as mediators. According to the [[Joshua Project]], forty percent of the Masubia are Christians while sixty percent  practice ethnic religion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=15102&amp;rog3=WA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The Masubia are well known for their vibrant cultural dances known as ''Chiperu'' and ''Chizo'' and their traditional attire, ''Musisi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People of Caprivi|url=http://www.caprivi.biz/people.html|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Miss Galaxy Pageant''' is an annual event held in [[Nukuʻalofa|Nuku{{Okina}}alofa]], [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Kingdom of Tonga]] that selects the "best" [[Fakaleiti]]. The event is held over a three night period and attracts crowds of up to 5000 people per night. The pageant has been operating since the mid-1990s and has become a major attraction for Tongans and tourists. Attendance by academics  include Professors [[Niko Besnier]], Heather Young-Leslie and Michael Poltorak, and international celebrities such as [[Pamela Stephenson]], Michael Wilson and [[Minnie Driver]].

The Miss Galaxy Pageant celebrates the creativity, diversity and talent of GLBT [[Fakaleiti]] communities in Tonga. Contestants are mostly from Tonga, but may come from the Pacific and the Tongan diaspora. Structured similarly to the [[Miss Heilala]] beauty pageant, the Miss Galaxy contest both emulates and parodies the heterosexual gender stereotypes which are showcased in the Miss Heilala and considered normative in Tongan society. As with other examples of gender-liminal celebrations, the pageant performances are often humorous, sometimes lewd and/or provocative. Thus, where the Miss Heilala serves to highlight and preserve traditional cultural ideals of femininity, and is associated strongly with a view of Tongan culture as unchanging and separate from other Pacific nations, the Miss Galaxy embraces modernity (perhaps even post-modernity) and translocality.&lt;ref&gt;Niko Besnier, Transgenderism, Locality, and the Miss Galaxy beauty pageant in Tonga. American Ethnologist 29(3), 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "[[Fakaleiti]]" literally translates as "like a lady". Traditionally in Tongan cultural practice, as in Samoa and other parts of Polynesia, there was recognition of men who preferred to behave like women, especially in terms of work. Weaving, barkcloth making, and other forms of creativity were feminine-gendered forms of work, and that some men gravitated to feminine behaviours was accepted. The term fakaleiti is an introduction into the Tongan language (leiti being borrowed from the English 'lady'), to describe this aspect of male gender liminality. Historically, this was not a disparaged social category. Eventually, the term Fakaleiti came to  include forms of male homosexuality and eroticism, including men who prefer sex with men, as well as other transgender persons. Today, while the term "Fakaleiti" is used by the general population to refer to a completely feminized man who lives and works as a woman, it is not preferred by the Tongan transgender community on the grounds that it suggests ''simulating'' femininity rather that being truly feminine. Transgender persons more commonly use the term "leiti" to refer to themselves.

==Organization and sponsorship==

The pageant is organized by the Tongan Leiti's Association (TLA). The TLA was founded by  [[Joleen 'Joey' Mataele]], an internationally recognized celebrity and event planner based in Tonga. Joey remains as director of the event.

The Miss Galaxy pageant has enjoyed various corporate sponsors and royal patronage over the years. Recently [[Air New Zealand]]  has supported the pageant, which is now formally named the Air New Zealand Galaxy Queen Beauty Pageant(MANZGQBP). Colloquially, it remains the Miss Galaxy pageant.

The Patron for the Miss Galaxy is the Honorable Salote Lupepau'u Salamasina Purea Vahine Ari'i o'e Hau Tuita, the eldest daughter of Her Royal Highness Princess Salote Mafile'o Pilolevu Tuita and her husband the Honorable Siosaia Ma'ulupekotofa Tuita. The Honourable Lupepau'u is the first grandchild of the late King of Tonga His Majesty King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV and Her Majesty Queen Halaevalu Mata'aho. She is a niece to the current king, Tupou VI.

The Guest of Honour is always a Royal family member. Usually this is the Honourable Salote Lupepau'u Tuita. She also acts as patron-advisor to the Tongan Leitis Association, who are the pageant's organisers.

==Tongan Leiti's association==

The Tongan Leiti's Association have a core membership of 483 local and International Tongan GLBT persons as of May 2010. A key member is Joleen 'Joey' Mataele, who is also the Pacific Island representative on the International Gay &amp; Lesbian Association (ILGA) Executive Board and is the Chairperson of the South Pacific MSM Network Group. The TLA are active in its mainstream community as advocates for the gender-liminal, and also promote HIV/AIDS Awareness to Youth, Family and its GLBTD communities. TLA launched Tonga's first ever condom and water-based lubricant campaign 2007.

==Development==

In a 2010 interview with ''The Link,'' the magazine published by [[Americans for Middle East Understanding]], Philip Weiss described the evolution of Mondoweiss:

:In March 2006 I began writing a daily blog on ''The New York Observer'' website. My editor, [[Peter Kaplan]], encouraged me to write what was on my mind and it was his idea to call it Mondoweiss. Increasingly what was on my mind were "Jewish issues": the Iraq disaster and my Jewishness, Zionism, neo-conservatism, Israel, Palestine. For many reasons that I detail in "Blogging about Israel and Jewish identity raises ''Observer'' hackles" in the spring of 2007 I re-launched my own blog on my own website. It became a collaborative effort a year ago when Adam Horowitz joined Mondoweiss.&lt;ref name=links&gt;Adas, Jane. [http://www.ameu.org/getattachment/e6febe66-2cc1-4e0a-8d31-3d4e696497e2/The-Olive-Trees-of-Palestine.aspx "From The Link's Links"], ''The Link'', Vol. 43, Issue 1, [[Americans for Middle East Understanding]], January–March 2010:12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The American Conservative]]'', Weiss detailed his split from ''The Observer'' and wrote, "Blogging about such matters sometimes made me feel wicked, as though I was betraying my tribe. Shouldn't some thoughts remain private? But I felt that the form demanded transparency about what I cared about, [[Jewish identity]]."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Weiss, [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/mondoweiss-chapter-one/ "Blogging about Israel and Jewish identity raises Observer hackles"], ''The American Conservative'', June 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

In 2008, after the arrest of [[Ben-Ami Kadish]], who allegedly gave Israel stolen United States secrets on nuclear weapons, fighter jets and missiles in the 1980s, ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'' quoted Mondoweiss as writing about an old [[Government Accountability Office]] report stating that Israel "conducts the most aggressive espionage operation against the United States of any U.S. ally".&lt;ref&gt;Brad A. Greenberg, [http://www.jewishjournal.com/thegodblog/item/bad_news_for_jews_american_accused_of_spying_for_israel_in_80s/ "Bad news for Jews: American accused of spying for Israel in '80s"], ''The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles'', April 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Weiss, [http://mondoweiss.net/2008/04/this-is-how-tuc.html "I Swear My Mama Doesn't Spy for Israel. Now, My Daddy–"], Mondoweiss, April 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 [[James Wolcott]] wrote in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' quoting Weiss in Mondoweiss regarding an [[Anti-Defamation League]] statement regarding the planned [[Park51]] project, an Islamic Center near the [[World Trade Center site]]. Wolcott quoted Weiss who had written: "It's happened: the Anti-Defamation League has overplayed its hand (in this case, neoconservative Islamophobia) in such a glaring manner that it is being condemned at every quarter ..."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Wolcott]], [http://www.vanityfair.com/online/wolcott/2010/07/the-anti-defamation-league-has-done  Foxman Agonistes (Updated)], ''Vanity Fair'', July 31, 2010, accessed February 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Weiss, [http://mondoweiss.net/2010/07/adl-statement-rationalizing-bigotry-draws-wide-scorn/ "'ADL' statement rationalizing bigotry draws wide scorn"], Mondoweiss, July 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 ''[[Tablet Magazine|Tablet]]'' magazine asserted that the [[Associated Press]] had "picked up a story from advocacy blog" Mondoweiss,&lt;ref name="tabmag"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tracy|first1=Marc|title=Ben-Gurion Airport Israeli Security Is Checking Arabs' and Muslims' Emails: Associated Press picks up story from advocacy blog Mondoweiss|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/101611/israeli-airport-security-now-checking-emails|website=Tablet Magazine|accessdate=30 December 2016|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; about Israeli security asking a Palestinian-American to show them her email at [[Ben-Gurion Airport]]. ''The Tablet'' wrote that the point was "that more news stories—and this story is undoubtedly newsworthy—are going to come to the attention of non-niche journalists and thereby gain wider notice".&lt;ref name=tabmag /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Najwa Doughman and Sasha Al-Sarabi, [http://mondoweiss.net/2012/06/do-you-feel-more-arab-or-more-american-two-arab-american-womens-story-of-being-detained-and-interrogated-at-ben-gurion.html "'Do you feel more Arab or more American?': Two women's story of being detained and interrogated at Ben Gurion"], Mondoweiss, June 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Mondoweiss revealed that [[United States Representative]]  [[Joseph R. Pitts]]' office had mailed a letter calling on Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] and [[Palestine National Authority]] Chair [[Yasser Arafat]] to work toward peace in the Middle East. The blog pointed out that Sharon had been in a coma since 2006 and Arafat had died in 2004. The representative blamed accidental use of an old form letter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-31369059.html "On Middle East, Pitts Lives In Past; Bloggers Have Field Day After Legislator's Letter Invokes Yasir Arafat, Who Died In 2004, And Ariel Sharon, In Coma Since 2006"], ''[[Intelligencer Journal]]'', May 16, 2012, via Highbeam.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Horowitz, [http://mondoweiss.net/2012/05/rep-pitts-in-damage-control-mode-following-call-for-arafat-sharon-negotiations.html "Rep. Pitts in damage control mode following call for Arafat-Sharon negotiations"], Mondoweiss, May 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Goldstone Report''==
Weiss and Horowitz, along with Lizzy Ratner, co-edited the 2011 book ''The Goldstone Report: The Legacy of the Landmark Investigation of the Gaza Conflict''.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Horowitz, Lizzy Ratner and Philip Weiss, [http://www.thenation.com/article/159952/goldstone-affair "The Goldstone Affair"], ''[[The Nation]]'', April 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' review noted that the abridged version of the [[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict]] ("the Goldstone Report"), included an introduction by [[Naomi Klein]] and an "eloquent" forward by [[Bishop Desmond Tutu]]. The review said the book was "enhanced" by oral testimonies which "inject a harrowing human element to counterbalance the report's dispassionate tone". The review called the book "An essential read for those concerned with accurate documentation of historical events and nations' accountability for their treatment of civilians living in war zones".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-56858-641-0 Review of ''The Goldstone Report: The Legacy of the Landmark Investigation of the Gaza Conflict''], ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', February 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called the book "An eye-opening document and an urgent call for accountability".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/adam-horowitz/goldstone-report/ Review of ''The Goldstone Report''], ''Kirkus Reviews'', published online October 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' interview Horowitz discussed [[Richard Goldstone]]'s later correction of one item in his report, his saying "Civilians were not intentionally targeted [by Israel] as a matter of policy." Horowitz expressed that he views this as a minor issue and "Much larger was the issue of intentionally attacking the civilian infrastructure of Gaza, which he doesn't mention, and the idea of just disproportionate and indiscriminate violence, which he doesn't address and which affects civilians disproportionately."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2011/4/4/judge_goldstone_retracts_part_of_his "Judge Goldstone Retracts Part of His Report on Israeli Assault on Gaza, Leaves Rest Intact"], ''Democracy Now!'', April 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Davidson, [http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=375679 "Judge Goldstone alters his verdict"], [[Ma'an News Agency]], July 4, 2011, updated November 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In March 2007, Gary Kamiya in an article for the ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' website wrote that Mondoweiss offered "informed and passionate discussions" of what Weiss states are "delicate and controversial matters surrounding American Jewish identity and Israel". Kamiya also states that Weiss, "routinely skewers attempts by mainstream Jewish organizations and pundits to lay down the law on what is acceptable discourse". He gave as an example Weiss exploring "off-limits" topics like [[dual loyalty]], as in an incident regarding the [[American Jewish Committee]]. Weiss had written that a Committee piece accusing Jewish intellectuals who did not "toe the party line on Israel" of being "self-haters" only revealed the "anti-intellectual, vicious, [[Omertà|omerta]] practices of the Jewish leadership".&lt;ref name=Kamiya&gt;Gary Kamiya, [http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/kamiya/2007/03/20/aipac/print.html "Can American Jews unplug the Israel lobby?"] [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]], March 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Michael Massing, in an article titled "The News About the Internet" for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', noted that "Weiss is one of several friends I've seen flourish online after enduring years of frustration writing for magazines. With its unrelenting criticism of Israel, his site [Mondoweiss] has angered even some of his fellow doves, but it has given voice to a strain of opinion that in the past had few chances of being heard."&lt;ref name=nyrob&gt;Michael Massing, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/aug/13/the-news-about-the-internet/?pagination=false "The News About the Internet"], ''The New York Review of Books'', March 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009 former [[United States Senator]] [[James Abourezk|James G. Abourezk]] praised Weiss and Horowitz for their courage in taking on "what most believe is an unassailable, monolithic pro-Israel Lobby". He wrote that the blog "hits Israel's illegal occupation where it hurts—in the center of the American Jewish community. Mondoweiss is evidence that more and more American Jews are thinking twice about giving Israel their wholehearted, unquestioning support for the crimes it is committing in the territories it illegally occupies."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Abourezk|James G. Abourezk]], [http://www.wrmea.org/wrmea-archives/321-washington-report-archives-2006-2010/november-2009/6361-mondoweiss-a-profile-in-courage.html "Mondoweiss: A Profile in Courage"], ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'', November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, [[James Wolcott]] of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' argued that Mondoweiss "is one of the most invaluable sites in the blogosphere, a blast of sanity and moral suasion against the prevailing demonization of anything and anyone perceived as anti-Israel".&lt;ref&gt;James Wolcott, [http://www.vanityfair.com/online/wolcott/2010/09/mondo-narco.html "Mondo Narco"], ''Vanity Fair'', September 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 ''[[Arab News]]'' wrote that Weiss and Horowitz had "developed an interactive forum that brims with up-to-the-minute news and comment and makes brilliant attention-grabbing use of text and video material" and that "they bring to their work a moral and intellectual verve woefully missing from coverage of Palestine-Israel issues in even the more respected sections of the mainstream media".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-303846920.html "Sidelining of mainstream media in Israel-Palestine debate"], ''Arab News'', September 30, 2012, via Highbeam.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Mondoweiss has received praise for its content, it has s also been criticized, much of which has come from people and organizations with differing opinions on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. This criticism has often included allegations of [[antisemitism]].

In 2010, Mondoweiss was criticized by the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] for publishing a series of cartoons which they stated expressed "anti-Israelism, a more recent category of anti-Semitism".&lt;ref name="JCPA"&gt;Levick, Adam, [http://jcpa.org/article/anti-semitic-cartoons-on-progressive-blogs/ "Anti-Semitic Cartoons on Progressive Blogs"], JCPA, September 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2010 and 2011,&lt;!-- Despite the WP article title, 'magazine' is not part of the title. --&gt; ''[[Tablet Magazine|Tablet]]'' magazine published three articles, in which Mondoweiss, along with some other blogs, were thoroughly criticized. These articles characterized Weiss as a "Jew-baiter" and "intensely anti-Israel", saying his site is "obsessed with Israel and the machinations of the U.S. Israel lobby", and laden with "sweeping and unsubstantiated rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Lee. [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/40064/mainstreaming-hate "Mainstreaming Hate"] ''Tablet'', July 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Lee. [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/40762/playing-with-fire "Playing With Fire"] ''Tablet'', July 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Michelle. [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/56447/mondo-weiss "Mondo Weiss"] ''Tablet'', January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Weiss responded to allegations in ''Tablet'', by stating that the magazine had "smeared" him and several other bloggers as Jew-baiters.&lt;ref name=monresp&gt;Philip Weiss, [http://mondoweiss.net/2010/07/tablet-is-mobbed-up-with-neocons.html "'Tablet' is mobbed up with neocons"], July 22, 2010, Mondoweiss.&lt;/ref&gt; Walt questioned the article's premise by stating that Smith's article contained "not a scintilla of evidence" that "Weiss, or I have written or said anything that is remotely anti-Semitic, much less that involves 'Jew-baiting'. There's an obvious reason for this omission: None of us has ever written or said anything that supports Smith's outrageous charges."&lt;ref name=waltresp&gt;Stephen Walt, [http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/07/21/the_problem_with_judging_a_blog_by_its_commenters "The problem with judging a blog by its commenters (updated)"], ''Foreign Policy'', July 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[Algemeiner Journal|The Algemeiner Journal]]'' characterized Mondoweiss as "Purveyors of Anti-Semitic Material".&lt;ref name="Algemeiner"&gt;Algemeiner Staff. [http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/23/salon-com-partners-with-purveyor-of-anti-semitic-material-mondoweiss/ "Salon.com Partners With Purveyor of Anti-Semitic Material Mondoweiss"], July 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Armin Rosen, a Media Fellow with ''[[The Atlantic]]'', criticized [[Peter Beinart]]'s blog, ''Open Zion'' (which appears in ''[[The Daily Beast]]'') for publishing an article by Alex Kane because he is Mondoweiss's "Staff Reporter". Rosen wrote that "''Mondoweiss'' often gives the appearance of an anti-Semitic enterprise."&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;Armin Rosen, [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-reminder-that-anti-semitism-has-no-place-in-debates-over-israel/259830/l "A Reminder That Anti-Semitism Has No Place in Debates Over Israel"], ''[[The Atlantic]]'', July 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]], a Senior Editor at ''The Atlantic'', responded to Rosen's article, writing "This tarring of Kane by virtue of his association with Mondoweiss would be lamentable even if Rosen produced a convincing indictment of Mondoweiss, showing that it indeed evinces anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]], [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/neo-mccarthyism/259849/ "Neo-McCarthyism"], ''The Atlantic'', July 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; James Fallows, a national correspondent for ''The Atlantic'' concurred with Wright's response to Rosen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/07/in-house-items-mayer-and-yahoo-mondoweiss/259932/ "In-House Items: Mayer and Yahoo"], Mondoweiss.&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Kane, Adam Horowitz, and Philip Weiss responded in ''Mondoweiss'' arguing that Rosen's article, "is about nothing more than policing the discourse on Israel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mondoweiss.net/2012/07/responding-to-the-atlantic-smear-on-mondoweiss.html Responding to ''The Atlantic'' smear on Mondoweiss.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, ''The Algemeiner Journal'' published another article decrying Mondoweiss for its associations with [[Judith Butler]], in light of her recent comments describing Islamist movements, even those of the militant variety, like [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]], as "social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left".&lt;ref&gt;Petra Marquardt-Bigman, [http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/09/07/defending-judith-butler-in-the-ivory-tower/ "Defending Judith Butler in The Ivory Tower"], ''The Algemeiner Journal'', September 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Peter Beinart]], writing for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', accused Mondoweiss of "ignoring human rights abuse unless it can be linked to America or capitalism or the West", and said that "By admitting that they're more interested in human rights violations when Israel commits them than when Hamas does, Horowitz and Roth are implying that they don't really see human rights as universal".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Beinart, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/13/why-not-criticize-hamas-s-rights-violations.html "Why Not Criticize Hamas's Rights Violations?"] ''The Daily Beast'', March 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in the year ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine accused Mondoweiss of being complicit in an "effort to delegitimize Jewish rights".&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, Jonathan S. [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2013/07/08/anti-semitic-hate-for-kids-and-adults-palestinians/ "Anti-Semitic Hate for Kids ... and Adults"], ''Commentary'', July 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Bradley Burston]], writing for ''[[Haaretz]]'', described Mondoweiss as "avowedly anti-Israel" in reference to its coverage of the [[2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/a-special-place-in-hell/.premium-1.602431/.premium-1.602431|title=Kidnap Denial: Blaming the victim of tragedy|last=Burston|first=Bradley|date=July 1, 2014|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Haaretz'' itself has described Mondoweiss as a "progressive Jewish website".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.562732 "Mock funding drive launched to send Bibi to Mandela service"] ''[[Haaretz]]'' December 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[David Bernstein (law professor)|David Bernstein]], writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', called the website a "hate site", and listed quotes from Weiss that he asserted were anti-Semitic. This included Weiss' claim that "the Israel lobby ... reflected a contract the American establishment had made with Jews to drive the economy in the 1970s",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/04/mondoweiss-is-a-hate-site/|title=“Mondoweiss” is a hate site (UPDATED)|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Bernstein likened to a belief in an "[[Elders of Zion]] type group".

According to Elliot Kaufman, the Vice President of Cardinal for Israel, a Stanford University group, writing in ''[[The Stanford Review]]'', Mondoweiss "often publishes astonishingly anti-Semitic material, using classic anti-Semitic imagery such as depicting Jews as spiders, cockroaches, or octopuses with tentacles controlling others, and Holocaust inversion. Its hatred of Israel is as deep as it is vicious."&lt;ref name="StanfordReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaufman|first1=Eliot|title=Stanford’s Most Radical Professor Strikes Again|url=http://stanfordreview.org/article/stanfords-most-radical-professor-strikes-again/|accessdate=13 April 2016|publisher=The Stanford Review|date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nassau Club''' is a historic [[Gentlemen's Club]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] founded in 1889 by, among others, [[Woodrow Wilson]].  It moved into its current location in 1903.  The clubhouse was originally built in 1813-14 as the home of [[Samuel Miller (theologian)|Samuel Miller]], the second professor of the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], on land belonging to his father-in-law, [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congressman]] [[Jonathan Dickinson Sergeant]].  Sergeant had built a large house on the site shortly before the [[American Revolution]] but it was burned down during the British occupation prior to the [[Battle of Princeton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hageman|first1=John Frelinghuysen|title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions, Volume 1|date=1878|publisher=J.B.

The club provides dining and social spaces, as well as guest rooms for visiting members.  It has allowed both male and female members for several decades.  The clubhouse was expanded in 1911, by architect [[Aymar Embury II]],&lt;ref name="Preservation"&gt;{{cite journal

'''Nubians''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|uː|b|i|ən|z|,_|ˈ|n|j|uː|-}}) are an ethnolinguistic group indigenous to present-day [[Sudan]] and southern [[Egypt]] who originate from the early inhabitants of the central [[Nile]] valley, believed to be one of the earliest [[cradle of civilization|cradles of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Keith Maisels (1993). The Near East: Archaeology in the "Cradle of Civilization. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-04742-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They speak [[Nubian languages]], part of the [[Northern Eastern Sudanic languages]].

Early [[Neolithic]] settlements from [[prehistoric Egypt]]  have been found in the central Nubian region dating back to 7000 BC, with [[Wadi Halfa]] believed to be the oldest settlement in the central Nile valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientsudan.org/burials_01_prehistory.htm|title=Ancient Sudan~ Nubia: Burials: Prehistory|website=www.ancientsudan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of [[Nubia]], such as [[Ta-Seti]] (the first [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] or administrative region of [[ancient Egypt]]), were continuously a part of [[ancient Egypt]] throughout the dynastic era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Ehret]]{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of Nubia, particularly Southern or Upper Nubia, were at times a part of ancient Pharaonic Egypt and at other times a rival state representing parts of [[Meroë]] or the [[Kingdom of Kush]]. However, by the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]], all of Nubia was united with Egypt, extending down to what is now [[Khartoum]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Nubia|title=Nubia - ancient region, Africa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the dynastic era, Upper Nubia broke off from Egypt proper. During that time, the Nubians founded a dynasty that ruled Upper and Lower Egypt in the eighth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;.{{Cite web|url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/02/black-pharaohs/robert-draper-text.html|title = Black Pharaohs|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = National Geographic|last = Draper|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; As warriors, the ancient Nubians were famous for their skill and precision with the [[bow and arrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brier|first1=Bob|authorlink1=Bob Brier|last2=Hobbs|first2=A.

In the [[Middle ages|medieval period]] the Nubians converted to [[Christianity]] and established three kingdoms: [[Nobatia]] in the north, [[Makuria]] in the center and [[Alodia]] in the south. 

Today, people of Nubian descent primarily live in southern Egypt, especially in the [[Luxor]] and [[Aswan]] area, and in northern Sudan, particularly in the region between the city of [[Wadi Halfa]] on the Egyptian-Sudanese border and [[al Dabbah, Sudan|al Dabbah]]. Additionally, several groups known as the [[Hill Nubians]] live in the northern [[Nuba Mountains]] in [[South Kordofan]] state, Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U88_xV5wOHoC&amp;pg=PA26|title=I Am a Nuba|last=Sesana|first=Renato Kizito|last2=Borruso|first2=Silvano|date=2006|publisher=Paulines Publications Africa|year=|isbn=9789966081797|location=|pages=26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main Nubian groups from north to south are the Halfaweyen, Sikut, [[Mahas]] and [[Dongola]].

==Etymology==
Throughout history various parts of [[Nubia]] were known by different names, including {{lang-egy|tꜣ stj}} "Land of the Bow", ''tꜣ nḥsj'', ''jꜣm'' "[[Kerma Culture|Kerma]]", ''jrṯt'', ''sṯjw'', ''wꜣwꜣt'', [[Meroitic language|Meroitic]]: ''akin(e)'' «Lower "Nubia"» and ''qes(a), qos(a)'' "Kush", and [[Greek Language|Greek]] ''[[Aethiopia]]''.&lt;ref name="oi.uchicago.edu"/&gt; The origin of the names ''Nubia'' and ''Nubian'' are contested. What is more certain is that they ultimately denote geographical provenance rather than ethnic origin. Based on cultural traits, many scholars believe Nubia is derived from the {{lang-egy|nbw}} "gold".&lt;ref name="Bianchi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bianchi|first=Robert Steven|title=Daily Life Of The Nubians|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313325014|pages=2, 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Empire]] used the term "Nubia" to describe the area of [[Upper Egypt]] and northern [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="oi.uchicago.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/museum-exhibits/history-ancient-nubia|title=The History of Ancient Nubia - The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago|website=oi.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another etymology traces the toponym to a distinct group of people, the ''Noubai'', who in more recent times inhabited the area that would become known as Nubia.&lt;ref name="Bianchi"/&gt; The derivation of the term "Nubian" has also been associated with the Greek historian [[Strabo]], who referred to the Nubas people.&lt;ref name="Remier 2010 135"&gt;{{cite book|last=Remier|first=Pat|title=Egyptian Mythology, A to Z|year=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438131801|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commemorative stela of the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axumite]] King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] indicates that two distinct population groups inhabited ancient Nubia: the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking ''Kasu'' (Kushites) who were related to the neighbouring [[ancient Egypt]]ians, and a [[Eastern Sudanic languages|Sudanic]]-speaking population that was instead related to [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotes]].&lt;ref name="Ezanastel"/&gt;
}}
The prehistory of Nubia dates to the [[Paleolithic]] around 300,000 years ago. By about 6000 BC, peoples in the region had developed an agricultural economy. They began using a system of writing relatively late in their history, when they adopted the Egyptian hieroglyphic system. Ancient history in Nubia is categorized according to the following periods:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bianchi|first=Robert Steven|title=Daily Life Of The Nubians|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313325014|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A-Group culture]] (3700–2800 BC), [[C-Group culture]] (2300–1600), [[Kerma culture]] (2500–1500), Nubian contemporaries of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1550–1069), the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]] (1000–653), [[Napata]] (1000–275), [[Meroë]] (275 BC–300/350 AD), [[Makuria]] (340–1317), [[Nobatia]] (350–650), and [[Alodia]] (600s–1504).

Historiolinguistic analysis indicates that the early inhabitants of the Nubia region, during the C-Group and Kerma cultures, were speakers of languages belonging to the [[Berber languages|Berber]] and [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branches of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic family]]. They were succeeded by the first Nubian language speakers, whose tongues belonged to the separate [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] phylum.&lt;ref name="Bechaus-Gerst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lbant"/&gt; Accordingly, a 4th-century victory stela belonging to King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] contains inscriptions describing two distinct population groups dwelling in ancient Nubia: a "red" ''Kasu'' population, who are believed to have been Cushitic speakers related to the neighbouring ancient Egyptians, and a "black" Eastern Sudanic-speaking population that was instead related to [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotes]].&lt;ref name="Ezanastel"&gt;{{cite book|title=Asiatic Society Monograph Series, Volume 15|date=1968|publisher=Asiatic Society|page=43|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=czlRAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of two such distinct population groups in Nubia has also been confirmed through genetic analysis (see [[Nubians#Genetics|genetics]]).&lt;ref name="Sirak2016"/&gt;

Although Egypt and Nubia have a shared pre-dynastic and pharaonic history, the two histories diverge with the fall of Ancient Egypt and the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 BC.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; At this point, the area of land between the 1st and the 6th cataract of the Nile became known as Nubia. Egypt was conquered first by the Greeks and then the Romans. During this time period, however, the Kushites formed the kingdom of Meroë, which was ruled by a series of legendary Candaces or Queens. Mythically, the Candace of Meroë was able to intimidate Alexander the Great into retreat with a great army of elephants, while historical documents suggest that the Nubians defeated the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar, resulting in a favorable peace treaty for Meroë.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Meroe/|title=Meroe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom of Meroë also defeated the Persians, and later Christian Nubia defeated the invading Arab armies on three different occasions resulting in the 600 year peace treaty of Baqt, the longest lasting treaty in history.&lt;ref&gt;Jakobielski, S. 1992. Chapter 8: "Christian Nubia at the Height of its Civilization." UNESCO General History of Africa, Volume III. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the kingdom of Christian Nubia occurred in the early 1500s resulting in full Islamization and reunification with Egypt under the Ottoman Empire, the Muhammad Ali dynasty, and British colonial rule. After the 1956 independence of Sudan from Egypt, Nubia and the Nubian people became divided between Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan.

Modern Nubians speak [[Nubian languages]], [[Eastern Sudanic languages]] that is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan family]]. The [[Old Nubian language]] is attested from the 8th century, and is the oldest recorded [[languages of Africa|language of Africa]] outside of the Afroasiatic family. It was the language of the [[Noba]] nomads who occupied the Nile between the First and Third [[Cataracts of the Nile|Cataracts]] and also of the ''Makorae'' nomads who occupied the land between the Third and Fourth Cataracts, following the collapse of the [[Kingdom of Kush]] sometime in the fourth century. The ''Makorae'' were a separate tribe who eventually conquered or inherited the lands of the Noba: they established a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]-influenced state called the Makuria, which administered the Noba lands separately as the [[eparchy]] of Nobatia. Nobadia was converted to [[Miaphysitism]] by the Orthodox priest Julian and Bishop Longinus of Constantinople, and thereafter received its bishops from the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].

Nubia consisted of four regions with varied agriculture and landscapes. The Nile river and its valley were found in the north and central parts of Nubia, allowing farming using irrigation. The western Sudan had a mixture of peasant agriculture and nomadism. Eastern Sudan had primarily nomadism, with a few areas of irrigation and agriculture. Finally, there was the fertile pastoral region of the south, where Nubia's larger agricultural communities were located.&lt;ref name="Lobban 2004 liii"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lobban|first=Richard|title=Historical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval Nubia|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810847842|pages=liii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nubia was dominated by kings from clans that controlled the gold mines. Trade in exotic goods from other parts of Africa (ivory, animal skins) passed to Egypt through Nubia.

==Language==
Modern Nubians speak [[Nubian languages]]. It belongs to the [[Eastern Sudanic languages|Eastern Sudanic branch]] of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan phylum]].

Before the arrival of the first Nubian speakers, languages from the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family are believed to have been spoken by the early inhabitants of the Nubia region. According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence indicates that the ancient peoples of the [[C-Group culture|C-Group]] and [[Kerma culture|Kerma]] civilizations spoke Afroasiatic languages of the [[Berber languages|Berber]] and [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branches, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bechaus-Gerst"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marianne Bechaus-Gerst|first1=Roger Blench, Kevin MacDonald (ed.)|title=The Origins and Development of African Livestock: Archaeology, Genetics, Linguistics and Ethnography - "Linguistic evidence for the prehistory of livestock in Sudan" (2000)|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135434166|page=453|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=-t5QAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lbant"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Behrens|first1=Peter|title=Libya Antiqua: Report and Papers of the Symposium Organized by Unesco in Paris, 16 to 18 January 1984 - "Language and migrations of the early Saharan cattle herders: the formation of the Berber branch"|date=1986|publisher=Unesco|isbn=9231023764|page=30|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=p_hwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nilo-Saharan [[Nobiin language]] today contains a number of key pastoralism related [[loanword]]s that are of Berber or proto-Highland East Cushitic origin, including the terms for sheep/goatskin, hen/cock, livestock enclosure, butter and milk. This in turn suggests that the C-Group and Kerma populations, who inhabited the Nile Valley immediately before the arrival of the first Nubian speakers, spoke Afroasiatic languages.&lt;ref name="Bechaus-Gerst"/&gt;

However, it is uncertain to which language family the ancient [[Meroitic language]] is related. Claude Rilly has proposed that it, like the Nobiin language, belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Rilly, Claude &amp; de Voogt, Alex | year = 2012 | title = The Meroitic Language and Writing System | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 1107008662 | url =  | access-date =  | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rilly, Claude | year = 2004 | url = http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/projets/clhass/PageWeb/ressources/Isolats/Meroitic%20Rilly%202004.pdf  | title = The Linguistic Position of Meroitic | journal = Sudan Electronic Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the [[Egyptian language]], instead belongs to the Afroasiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and [[phonotactics]], which are similar to those of the Afroasiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages.&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, Kirsty (2011). "Meroitic Consonant and Vowel Patterning". ''Lingua Aegytia'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, Kirsty (2006), [http://www.soas.ac.uk/linguistics/research/workingpapers/volume-14/file37822.pdf "Meroitic - An Afroasiatic Language?"] ''{{abbr|SOAS|School of Oriental and African Studies}} Working Papers in Linguistics'' 14:169–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Nubians==
[[Image:Egypt-Nubian wedding.jpg|thumb|Nubian wedding near [[Aswan]]]]
The descendants of the ancient Nubians still inhabit the general area of what was ancient Nubia. They currently live in what is called Old Nubia, mainly located in modern Egypt. Nubians have been resettled in large numbers (an estimated 50,000 people) away from southern Egypt since the 1960s, when the [[Aswan High Dam]] was built on the Nile, flooding ancestral lands.&lt;ref name="Fernea 2005 ix-xi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernea|first=Robert A.|title=Nubian Ceremonial Life: Studies in Islamic Syncretism And Cultural Change|year=2005|publisher=American University in Cairo Press|isbn=9789774249556|pages=ix-xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some resettled Nubians continue working as farmers (sharecroppers) on resettlement farms whose landowners live elsewhere; most work in Egypt's cities. Whereas Arabic was once only learned by Nubian men who travelled for work, it is increasingly being learned by Nubian women who have access to school, radio and television. Nubian women are working outside the home in increasing numbers.&lt;ref name="Fernea 2005 ix-xi"/&gt;

In the [[1973 Arab–Israeli War]] Egypt employed Nubian people as codetalkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140131-egypt-nubia-dams-nile-constitution-culture/|title=Changing Egypt Offers Hope to Long-Marginalized Nubians|date=1 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/39595/Egypt/Politics-/Remembering-Nubia-the-Land-of-Gold.aspx|title=Remembering Nubia: the Land of Gold - Politics  - Egypt - Ahram Online|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cairowestmag.com/el-nuba/|title=El Nuba - Cairo West Magazine|first=Cairo|last=West|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Old Nubian manuscript.jpg|thumbnail|Old Nubian manuscript]]
Nubians have developed a common identity, which has been celebrated in poetry, novels, music and storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kemp, Graham |author2=Douglas P. Fry |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Keeping the Peace: Conflict Resolution and Peaceful Societies Around the World|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415947626|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nubians in modern Sudan include the Danaqla around Dongola Reach, the Mahas from the Third Cataract to Wadi Halfa, and the Sikurta around Aswan. These Nubians write using their own script. They also practice [[scarification]]: Mahas men and women have three scars on each cheek, while the Danaqla wear these scars on their temples. Younger generations appear to be abandoning this custom.&lt;ref name="Clammer 2010 138"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clammer|first=Paul|title=Sudan: the Bradt travel guide|year=2010|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=9781841622064|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nubia's ancient cultural development was influenced by its geography. It is sometimes divided into Upper Nubia and Lower Nubia. Upper Nubia was where the ancient Kingdom of Napata (the Kush) was located. Lower Nubia has been called [https://www.scribd.com/doc/125867355/Adams-w-The-Nubian-Kingdom-of-Kerma-Nubia-Corridor-to-Africa "the corridor to Africa"], where there was contact and cultural exchange between Nubians, Egyptians, Greeks, Assyrians, Romans, and Arabs. Lower Nubia was also where the [[Meroë|Kingdom of Meroe]] flourished.&lt;ref name="Lobban 2004 liii"/&gt; The languages spoken by modern Nubians are based on ancient Sudanic dialects. From north to south, they are: Kenuz, Fadicha (Matoki), Sukkot, Mahas, Danagla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lobban|first=Richard|title=Historical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval Nubia|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810847842|pages=liv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerma, Nepata and Meroe were Nubia's largest population centres. The rich agricultural lands of Nubia supported these cities. Ancient Egyptian rulers sought control of Nubia's wealth, including gold, and the important trade routes within its territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bulliet, Richard W., and Pamela Kyle Crossley, Daniel R. Headrick, Lyman L. Johnson, Steven W. Hirsch|title=The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History to 1550|year=2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780618771509|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nubia's trade links with Egypt led to Egypt's domination over Nubia during the New Kingdom period. The emergence of the Kingdom of Meroe in the 8th century BC led to Egypt being under the control of Nubian rulers for a century, although they preserved many Egyptian cultural traditions.&lt;ref name="Bulliet, Richard W., and Pamela Kyle Crossley, Daniel R. Headrick, Lyman L. Johnson, Steven W. Hirsch 2007 83"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bulliet, Richard W., and Pamela Kyle Crossley, Daniel R. Headrick, Lyman L. Johnson, Steven W.

Meroe became the centre of power for Nubia and cultural links with sub-Saharan Africa gained greater influence.&lt;ref name="Bulliet, Richard W., and Pamela Kyle Crossley, Daniel R. Headrick, Lyman L. Johnson, Steven W. Hirsch 2007 83"/&gt;

===Religion===
Today, Nubians practice [[Islam]]. To a certain degree, Nubian religious practices involve a [[syncretism]] of Islam and [[traditional]] folk beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernea|first=Robert A.|title=Nubian Ceremonial Life: Studies in Islamic Syncretism And Cultural Change|year=2005|publisher=American University in Cairo Press|isbn=9789774249556|pages=iv-ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times, Nubians practiced a mixture of traditional religion and Egyptian religion. Prior to the spread of Islam, many Nubians practiced Christianity.&lt;ref name="Clammer 2010 138"/&gt;

Ancient Nepata was an important religious centre in Nubia. It was the location of [[Gebel Barkal]], a massive sandstone hill resembling a rearing cobra in the eyes of the ancient inhabitants. Egyptian priests declared it to be the home of the ancient deity [[Amun]], further enhancing Nepata as an ancient religious site. This was the case for both Egyptians and Nubians. Egyptian and Nubian deities alike were worshipped in Nubia for 2,500 years, even while Nubia was under the control of the New Kingdom of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Remier 2010 135"/&gt; Nubian kings and queens were buried near Gebel Barkal, in pyramids as the Egyptian pharaohs were. [[Nubian pyramids]] were built at Gebel Barkal, at Nuri (across the Nile from Gebel Barkal), at El Kerru, and at Merroe, south of Gebel Barkal.&lt;ref name="Remier 2010 135"/&gt;

==Architecture==
{{main article|Nubian architecture}}
Modern Nubian architecture in Sudan is distinctive, and typically features a large courtyard surrounded by a high wall. A large, ornately decorated gate, preferably facing the Nile, dominates the property. Brightly colored stucco is often decorated with symbols connected with the family inside, or popular motifs such as geometric patterns, palm trees, or the evil eye that wards away bad luck.&lt;ref name="Clammer 2010 138"/&gt;

Nubians invented the [[Nubian vault]], a type of curved surface forming a [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] structure.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Genetics==
According to Y-DNA analysis by Hassan et al. (2008), around 44% of Nubians in Sudan carry the [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|haplogroup J]]. The remainder mainly belong to the [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] clade (23%). Both paternal lineages are also common among local [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations. The next most frequent haplogroups borne by Nubians are the Western European-linked [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]] clade (10%) and the Eurasian lineage [[Haplogroup F (Y-DNA)|F]] (10%), followed by the archaic African [[Haplogroup B-M60|B]] haplogroup (8%) and the Europe-associated [[Haplogroup I-M170|I]] clade (5%).&lt;ref name="Hassan2008"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hassan, Hisham Y., et al.|title=Y‐chromosome variation among Sudanese: Restricted gene flow, concordance with language, geography, and history|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=2008|volume=137|issue=3|pages=316–323|url=http://docdro.id/e90MDsD|accessdate=11 October 2017|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20876|pmid=18618658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternally, Hassan (2009) observed that approximately 83% of their Nubian samples carried various subclades of the Africa-centered [[Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA)|macrohaplogroup L]]. Of these mtDNA lineages, the most frequently borne clade was [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3]] (30.8%), followed by the [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0a]] (20.6%), [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2]] (10.3%), [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1]] (6.9%), [[Haplogroup L4 (mtDNA)|L4]] (6.9%) and [[Haplogroup L5 (mtDNA)|L5]] (6.9%) haplogroups. The remaining 17% of Nubians belonged to sublineages of the Eurasian macrohaplogroups [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M]] (3.4% M/D, 3.4% M1) and [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|N]] (3.4% [[Haplogroup N1a (mtDNA)|N1a]], 3.4% [[Haplogroup R0 (mtDNA)|preHV1]], 3.4% [[Haplogroup R (mtDNA)|R]]/[[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U6a1]]).&lt;ref name="Hassan2009"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hassan, Hisham Y.|title=Genetic Patterns of Y-chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Variation, with Implications to the Peopling of the Sudan|publisher=University of Khartoum|pages=90-92|url=http://docdro.id/8GAIp0X|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysing a different group of Nubian individuals inhabiting Sudan, Non (2010) found a significantly higher frequency of around 48% of the Eurasian macrohaplogroups M and N. Of these mtDNA lineages, 16% of the examined Nubians belonged to the M clade (around 9% to M1), with the rest bearing N subhaplogroups (including approximately 8% [[Haplogroup R0 (mtDNA)|R0]], 3% [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T1a]], and 1% [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]]). The remaining 52% of Nubians carried various Africa-centered macrohaplogroup [[Haplogroup L (mtDNA)|L(xM,N)]] derivatives, with about 11% of individuals belonging to the L2a1 subclade.&lt;ref name="Non"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Non|first1=Amy|title=ANALYSES OF GENETIC DATA WITHIN AN INTERDISCIPLINARY FRAMEWORK TO INVESTIGATE RECENT HUMAN EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY AND COMPLEX DISEASE|page=140|url=http://etd.fcla.edu/UF/UFE0041981/non_a.pdf|publisher=University of Florida|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobon et al. (2015) identified an ancestral autosomal component of West Eurasian origin that is common to many modern Nubians and Afroasiatic-speaking populations in the [[Nile Valley]] and [[Horn of Africa]], including [[Sudanese Arabs]]. Known as the ''Coptic'' component, it peaks among Egyptian [[Copts]] who settled in Sudan over the past two centuries. The scientists associate the Coptic component with Ancient Egyptian ancestry, without the later Arabian influence that is present among other Egyptians.&lt;ref name=Dobon2015&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Begoña Dobon, et al.|title=The genetics of East African populations: a Nilo-Saharan component in the African genetic landscape|journal=Scientific Reports|date=28 May 2015|volume=5|doi=10.1038/srep09996|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09996.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2015|pages=9996|pmid=26017457|pmc=4446898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollfelder et al. (2017) also analysed various populations in Sudan and similarly observed close autosomal affinities between their Nubian and Sudanese Arab samples.&lt;ref name="Hollfelder"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hollfelder|first=Nina|last2=Schlebusch|first2=Carina M.|last3=Günther|first3=Torsten|last4=Babiker|first4=Hiba|last5=Hassan|first5=Hisham Y.|last6=Jakobsson|first6=Mattias|date=2017-08-24|title=Northeast African genomic variation shaped by the continuity of indigenous groups and Eurasian migrations|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006976|journal=PLOS Genetics|volume=13|issue=8|pages=e1006976|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006976|issn=1553-7404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Sirak et al. also analysed the [[ancient DNA]] of a Christian-period inhabitant of [[Kulubnarti]] in Nubia. The scientists found that the medieval specimen was most closely related to Middle Eastern populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Optimizing ancient DNA yield from Saharan African samples|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kendra_Sirak/publication/275031861_No_longer_the_1_Optimizing_ancient_DNA_yield_from_Saharan_African_samples/links/552fc9220cf27acb0de71c22.pdf|publisher=Sirak et al.|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further excavations of two Early Christian period (AD 550-800) cemeteries at Kulubnarti, one located on the mainland and the other on an island, revealed the existence of two ancestrally and socioeconomically distinct local populations. Ancient DNA analysis of specimens from these burial sites found that the mainland samples predominantly carried European and Near Eastern mtDNA clades, such as the [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|K1]], [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]], [[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)|I5]], and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U1]] lineages; only 36.4% of the mainland individuals belonged to African-based maternal haplogroups. By contrast, 70% of the specimens at the island burial site bore African-based clades, among which were the [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2]], [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1]] and [[Haplogroup L5 (mtDNA)|L5]] mtDNA haplogroups.&lt;ref name="Sirak2016"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Sirak, Kendra; Frenandes, Daniel; Novak, Mario; Van Gerven, Dennis; Pinhasi, Ron|title=Abstract Book of the IUAES Inter-Congress 2016 - A community divided?

The '''Nzema''' are an [[Akan people]] numbering about 328,700, of whom 262,000 live in southwestern [[Ghana]] and 66,700 live in the southeast of [[Côte d'Ivoire]]. In Ghana the Nzema area is divided into three electoral districts of [[Nzema East Municipal]] also referred to as Evalue Gwira, Ellembele District and Nzema West, which is also referred to as [[Jomoro District]] of Ghana. [[Nzema language|Their language]] is also known as '''Nzima''' (in Ghana) or '''Appolo''' (in the Ivory Coast). 

The Nzema are mostly farmers. According to their traditional calendar, days are ordered in cycles of seven, and these follow each other in a three-week cycle. They have a [[matrilineal]] [[kinship system]], with descent and property passed through the maternal lines. 

A religious [[Kundum Festival]] is held annually all over the Ahanta-Nzema area. Its start is timed to coordinate with the harvest period, so local communities determine when that will be. It begins in the easternmost part of Ahanta and advances southwestward together with the harvest period. Ritual drumming, singing and dancing take place for four weeks, and are considered the way the community expels devils and protects its good fortune. This festival is the main occasion on which the satirical ''avudewene'' songs are performed by young men. 
The pan-Africanist [[Kwame Nkrumah]] was an Nzema. [[Anton Wilhelm Amo]], who was born in the [[Axim]] region and taken to Europe as a boy, was raised in Germany as one of a duke's family and educated in the best schools and universities. He became a philosopher in eighteenth-century Germany, teaching at two universities, before he returned to his homeland. Also a member of the tribe was the religious leader [[Maame Harris Tani]].

The '''Old Bold Pilots Association''' is a group of pilots and enthusiasts who meet weekly to enjoy breakfast and discuss their enthusiasm for aviation. The organization is notable for the diverse background of its members that includes civilians and veterans of [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. Members have served in the United States military, the United Kingdom's [[Royal Air Force]], Germany's [[Luftwaffe]], and the [[Soviet Air Forces]].

==History==
The Old Bold Pilots Association (OBPA) traces its beginnings to the mid-1980s when four former [[United States Army Air Force]] [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolt]] pilots met regularly for a meal and to share flying stories.&lt;ref name="Joiner (2014)" /&gt; The society formed with its current name and meeting location in 1995 at the suggestion of member Ray Toliver.&lt;ref name="OBPA History 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis (Jan 2007)" /&gt; The name of the group is a refutation of an observation made in 1949 by early [[airmail]] pilot, E. Hamilton Lee: "There are old pilots and bold pilots, but no old, bold pilots."&lt;ref name="Davis (Jan 2007)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodspeed (April 2014)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowan (July 2014)" /&gt; The association is informal without a [[project charter|charter]], dues, or speakers.&lt;ref name="Joiner (2014)" /&gt; Informality was desired by members who rejected the strict rules common in other aviation groups.&lt;ref name="Kragen (April 2014)" /&gt; One does not have to be a pilot to attend, and anyone with an interest in aviation is invited.&lt;ref name="McCormac (February 2012)" /&gt;

==Activities==
[[File:OBPA Breakfast Oceanside CA 20140924.jpg|thumb|OBPA Breakfast 2014]]
The OBPA holds a breakfast event every Wednesday at a [[Denny's]] restaurant in Oceanside, California. The breakfast starts at 8 am although members start showing up as early as 6:30 am to get a head start on the festivities. The group occupies the back room of the restaurant which is decorated with model aircraft hanging from the ceiling and photos of aircraft and pilots lining the walls.&lt;ref name="Kragen (April 2014)" /&gt; Attendees come from communities throughout southern California. Less frequent are visitors from around the world including Germany, Australia, Hungary and South Africa.&lt;ref name="Davis (Jan 2007)" /&gt; Some come for the camaraderie while others find relief discussing the rigors of combat with people who have had similar experiences.&lt;ref name="Joiner (2014)" /&gt;

{{As of|2014}}, membership has grown to over 300 people, although attendance at the weekly breakfast is typically 50–70 people.&lt;ref name="Kragen (April 2014)" /&gt; According to the group's web page, an annual Christmas party and periodic barbecues are also hosted.&lt;ref name="OBPA Christmas 2013" /&gt;

==Interviews for posterity==
{{Quote box
   |quoted = yes
   |salign = right
   |quote = What's unique about the Old Bold Pilots is that so many show up every week. And the way they look out for each other and care for each other. There's a mutual respect not only for other Allied pilots but for the Luftwaffe pilots they flew against.

Heather Steele is a historian of warfare who over the course of several years interviewed a number of the OBPA members and captured their stories on her World War II History Project web site.&lt;ref name="Joiner (2014)" /&gt; Jonelle Cambis is a waitress who has served the OBPA at Dennys for over 20 years. Her father was in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]] with the U.S. Marines during World War II, and she credits the stories told by her customers with motivating her to document her father's activities.&lt;ref name="Kragen (April 2014)" /&gt;

In 2014, retired producer, Patrick Pranica, with friends George Dawe and Robert Broughton began interviewing OBPA members to record their stories for future generations. They started first with older OBPA members due to their advanced age but planned to include all willing to participate. The initial interviews were intended to result in a documentary titled, ''Old Bold Pilots'', that was hoped would interest cable channels into funding a television series. The pilot episode included an interview with Robert Broughton's brother, [[Jack Broughton]], a famous fighter ace and aviation author.&lt;ref name="Kragen (June 2014)" /&gt; However, funding could not be secured. The team also tried a [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] campaign that did not succeed and was eventually closed.&lt;ref name="IndiGoGo OBP 2014" /&gt;

== Other chapters==
Chapters of the Old Bold Pilots have opened in [[Palm Desert, California]], [[Seattle, Washington]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Kragen (April 2014)" /&gt; The Palm Desert group meets for breakfast at the Desert Willow Golf Resort on the last Thursday of each month and includes a presentation by a guest speaker.&lt;ref name="OBP Palm Desert" /&gt; Past speakers have included aerial [[stuntman]] [[Troy Hartman]], former [[Northrop Grumman]] [[Chief Executive Officer]] [[Kent Kresa]], fighter ace [[Frederick R. Payne, Jr.|Fritz Payne]], [[aerospace engineering|aerospace engineer]] [[Burt Rutan]], and aviation artist [[Stan Stokes]].&lt;ref name="OBP Palm Desert Speakers" /&gt; The Washington, D.C. group meets for lunch every Friday at the Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia.&lt;ref name="Samuel 2015" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5228">The term '''paramount ruler''', or sometimes '''paramount king''', is a generic description, though occasionally also used as an actual title, for a number of rulers' position in relative terms, as the summit of a [[feudalistic]] pyramid of rulers of lesser polities (such as [[vassal]] [[prince]]s) in a given historical and geographical context, often of different ranks, which all recognize the single paramount ruler as their senior, though not necessarily with effectively commanding authority (as in a true [[empire]]), but often rather a notion like the Western [[suzerainty]].

Whether the term is used where it could apply is essentially a matter of convention, and as the relatively vague, similar definitions overlap, its use may in certain cases coexist with the use of another term as those mentioned in the ''See also'' section.

==Examples==
*In [[India]], i.e. the subcontinent, including present [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]], the Muslim Sultans of Delhi, known as [[Grand Mughal]]s because of their Turkic ancestry tracing back to Genghis Khan, managed to bring most rulers of the so-called [[princely state]]s, in majority Hindu, under their imperial authority. This was deservedly expressed by the majestic style of [[Padshah]] (like the Ottoman [[Sultan of Sultans]] and the Persian [[Shahanshah]], both truly ruling vast Islamic Empires) of Hindus. After a few generations they lost most of their power over the princes, and could hence rather be considered mere paramount rulers, at best receiving tribute and honorary trappings, while the true political hegemony progressively shifted to the new players, the European colonial powers. After a struggle against the French and their ally, Tippu Sultan (a short while styled [[Padishah Bahadur]] of Khudadad, a Muslim state in southern India), the British emerged victorious, mostly in the guise of the [[Honourable East India Company]]. Later they encouraged the ruler of [[Awadh]] (Oudh) to reject the Mughal's suzerainty and assume the style of Padishah themselves, till the British finally toppled both; still later, the British Crown declared itself, as successors to the Mughal Paramountcy, Emperors of India.
*Also in India (proper), the term has been used to describe the [[Peshwa]] (though formally prime minister of the [[Maharaja Chatrapati]] of [[Satara (city)|Satara]] who had lost power to him, so not a nominal head of state) or his constitutional master as hegemon of the [[Maratha Empire|Mahratta confederation]], which failed in its nationalist bid for control over India against the British Raj.
* [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], a Malay title usually translated as "Supreme Head", "Supreme Ruler" or "Paramount Ruler", is the official title of the constitutional head of state of the federal state of [[Malaysia]], elected for five years from among nine monarchs of constitutive states on the Malaysian peninsula.
*Analogous is the President of the [[United Arab Emirates]], formally elected by the rulers of the member states of the UAE from among their number, de facto hereditary in the person of the ''Hakim'' of [[Abu Dhabi]] emirate (not unlike the Habsburg emperors in the Holy Roman Empire).
*In the [[Comoros]] archipelago, certain rulers of a few major sultanates on Grande Comore have been recognized by the paramount title of [[Sultani tibe]] of the island.
* The [[Caliph]] of Islam is the secular head of the Muslim [[ummah]], whose authority is theoretically recognised by Muslims across political borders. At various points in history, however, the political authority of the Caliph outside the domains of the [[Caliphate]] itself has waxed and waned. 
* The [[Holy Roman Emperors]] were elected by the [[Prince-elector|Electorates]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The King of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was similarly elected.

==Use for foreign rulers==
*On 1 March 1900 the [[Samoa]]n archipelago (a Polynesian nation, royal style ''O le Tupu o Samoa'', from 7 November 1889 a tripartite German–British–U.S. protectorate, represented by the three Consuls) was annexed by Germany alone (except for the part that became American Samoa; hence long known as Western Samoa). The German ''Kaiser'' (Hohenzollern emperor) was styled there ''Tupu Sili o Samoa'' "Paramount King of Samoa" until the allied take-over during [[World War I]].
*The British monarch, styled King or Queen, is still recognised as ''Paramount Chief of [[Fiji]]'', even after it became a republic within the Commonwealth, of which she also is the sole Head.

==See also==
*[[Great King]] – equivalent, among rulers who all can be considered Kings
*[[Hegemon]] – irrespective to titles, mere preponderance in power terms
*[[High King]] – equivalent, among rulers who all can be considered Kings
*[[King of Kings]] – equivalent, among rulers who all can be considered Kings
*[[Paramount Chief]] – equivalent in relative terms, but among tribal people without a fully developed state, often rather autonomous within a 'real' state

'''ProFIT-MAP''' is a business [[methodology]] for improving organizational performance and managing execution. Its objective is to help organizations achieve their cost and operational targets. It does this by identifying the relevant parameters that managers can control, linking them to the business objectives, showing which changes will be effective, and creating an execution roadmap that will achieve the objectives.

For any business improvement challenge, ProFIT-MAP answers four important management questions. Managers then use this information as an input into their decision making process.

# Can it be done? Is it possible? If not, then what additional capabilities are needed?
# Will it be [[Profit (accounting)|profitable]]?
# What is the impact of my decision across the product mix and the functional capabilities of the organization?
# How do I transform operations from point A to point B? That is, what is the operational roadmap for achieving the business objectives?

==How it works==
The process of using the ProFIT-MAP methodology is referred to as [[profit mapping]]. ProFIT-MAP assesses the current and future operational requirements of any business challenge from three integrated perspectives representing the business process, its associated resource requirements, and the financial characteristics. Understanding the cost and profitability implications of any process improvement decision prior to its implementation is central to profit mapping.

==Six phases==
The methodology consists of six phases which must be completed in order. There is built-in flexibility to iterate within and between the phases as managers refine their thinking and gain additional experience with the particular business challenge.

{|
|'''Six phases'''
|'''Description'''
|-
|'''Phase 1''': Project objectives
|Defines the business problem; frames it in terms of products, facilities, lines, operations, etc.
|-
|'''Phase 2''': Process
|Captures relevant operating policies, product demand, data about operations (e.g., shifts), and the process (e.g., cycle time).
|-
|'''Phase 3''': Resources
|Captures investments, labor, utilities, materials, supplies, and inventories data as appropriate.
|-
|'''Phase 4''': Finance
|Captures indirect costs and SG&amp;A expenses as appropriate.
|-
|'''Phase 5''': “What-If” plan
|Creates the plan for assessing the various business scenarios identified by management for improving performance.
|-
|'''Phase 6''': Choose business execution option
|Quantifies and compares the business scenarios; enables management to select option(s) that best meet the business objectives; creates the execution roadmap.
|}

== Focus on business execution ==

Profit mapping is used by companies to execute their strategy no matter what it is. Strategy can range from everything to improving profitability, increasing customer satisfaction, reducing costs, becoming more flexible in product or service delivery, reducing waste, and so on.

As companies translate strategy into measurable objectives, profit mapping then bridges the gap between planning and execution. It does this by identifying:

* The nature of the problem within the context of the capabilities and constraints of the organization.
* The specific parameters under management control that are linked to the business challenges.
* The sensitivity of the various parameters for improving business performance.
* An execution roadmap showing the specific steps and actions required to achieve the business objectives.

== Complementary nature ==

Profit mapping complements the many strategic frameworks, improvement approaches, and measurement options in business today. It does not replace what companies already find helpful. Rather, its integrated and dynamic nature enhances existing business improvement efforts by providing additional critical “perspective” and guidance that might not otherwise be available to decision makers.

For example, there is an implicit assumption that becoming lean or reducing product defects through [[Six Sigma]] leads to cost savings. Many companies have learned through experience that while these are sound improvement strategies, they do not always have the intended impact on overall business performance relative to the financial and time investment devoted to the efforts.

Such results should not be surprising as lean and Six Sigma are designed to improve process efficiency, but do not explicitly focus on the overall effectiveness of the organization.  Profit mapping can help these types of process-focused initiatives by showing precisely which lean or Six Sigma activities will lead to both process as well as financial improvement. This helps managers understand the cost and profitability implications of their change options so they can make more effective decisions.

==Parametric-activities-based framework==
Activities are at the core of ProFIT-MAP. The methodology employs a parametric activities based framework for capturing the business structure and dynamic characteristics of operations. ProFIT-MAP:

* Develops a more integrated and refined understanding of operations based on the activities required to produce products at each plant and line – or site and service.
* Translates the activities composition into the resource requirements and associated cost and profitability implications for the product or line.
* Quantifies all identified management options for improving the business (i.e., business scenarios)
* Tests the business scenarios for sensitivity to changes in order to create a more profitable environment.
* Identifies activities that will lead to business success.
* Identifies activities that do not further the objectives, and thereby avoid wasting time and resources.
* Creates a profitable and sustainable operational roadmap.

==Methodology and analytical requirements==
ProFIT-MAP is a non-proprietary methodology and is described in the book profit mapping. As managers develop ideas in the form of business scenarios for improving the organization, analytical capabilities are required that can quantify the impact of the various business improvement options. The objective is to help managers select the “best” option(s) from the standpoint of the overall business – not just those that may result in isolated improvements but not necessarily for the organization.

ProFIT-MAP requires the integrated assessment of each decision option in terms of the process characteristics, resource requirements, and financial effects. There are many software tools that address aspects of each of these areas individually. Most importantly, any software tool must enable apple-to-apple comparisons within each of these domains as well as between them. Otherwise, managers will not have a level playing field to holistically evaluate and compare their alternatives for improving the business.

==History==
ProFIT-MAP was created by Anil Menawat. Its foundation is based on [[systems theory]], which is an integrated approach for studying complex, dynamic, and interdependent systems. It also had roots in [[parameter|parametric]] costing which dates back to World War II where government planners needed a better way to forecast the cost of manufacturing aircraft.

The name ProFIT-MAP is derived from two elements. “ProFIT” comes from “process and finance integration technology.” This refers to the methodology’s integrated multi-perspective focus on business execution. “MAP” refers to the methodology’s ability to create a highly detailed roadmap for improving the business.

'''Prosecutor sex scandal''' is a sex scandal In [[South Korea]] where the male investigating prosecutor had several [[sexual encounters]] with the female suspect under duress.  The scandal caused a flurry of media reporting and shocks to the public trust of the justice system.

==Facts==

===Female suspect===
In October 10, 2012, Suspect ("S") is a housewife who has been charged by Seoul Gangdong Police for 16 counts of theft of 4 million Korean Won worth of clothing, shoes and frozen products in one discount store by removing RFID tag in the toilets or fitting rooms which were recorded by the [[CCTV]].  She had been arrested for the similar charge in August of the same year.  She told the police that her five-year-old daughter was sexually assaulted at the kindergarten and received a psychological therapy with her daughter but the trauma caused her kleptomania and submitted a medical record from the psychiatrist.  The police, given that she was raising three children and had a history of psychiatric treatment, investigated her without arrest and sent her file to the Prosecutors Office in Eastern District of Seoul for indictment.  She has been represented by an attorney-at-law, Chulseong Jung.

===Prosecutor===
The prosecutor was a married, 30-year-old man and graduated in the top at a private law school Seoul.  He passed the [[patent bar]] only at the age of 20, the youngest person to do so in that year and graduated from [[Seoul National University]] with a degree in [[Electrical engineering]].

==Facts==
S was summoned to the prosecutor's office on Saturday when there was no one in the room.  S alleges that she cried for the fear of prosecution and the prosecutor, consoling S at first, moved to initiate sexual acts which led to sexual intercourse.  Later, the prosecutor called S and met near the office and took her to his car.  S alleges that he again forced her to perform oral sex on him which she resisted at first, saying that others are seeing and she complied.  He took S to a motel near Wangsipli and had sex again and made sure she did use contraceptives.

==Repercussions==
In November 2012, the Prosecution Service was under public criticism due to recent bribery scandal involving high ranking prosecutor.  The news broke out and created a huge public uproar.  The case is unique because the prosecutor was barely one year in service just out of law school.  It has a damaging effect on the public trust on the justice system in Korea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20647">'''Prostitution in Indonesia''' is legally considered a "crime against decency/morality", although it is widely practiced, tolerated and even regulated in some areas.&lt;ref name="spl"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://spl.ids.ac.uk/sexworklaw/countries |title= Sex Work Law |last= |first= |date=  |website= Sexuality, Poverty and Law Programme |publisher= |access-date= 26 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women are financially motivated to become prostitutes, while others may be forced by friends, relatives or strangers. Traditionally, they have met with customers in entertainment venues or special prostitution complexes, or ''lokalisasi''. However, recently internet forums and [[Facebook]] have been used to facilitate prostitute-client relations. In recent years, [[child sex tourism]] has become an issue at the resort islands of [[Batam]] and [[Bali]]. 
[[Female sex tourism]] also emerged in the late 20th century in Bali. Young Balinese male sex workers meet with Japanese,&lt;ref name="indi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women who travel for sex: Sun, sea and gigolos|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/women-who-travel-for-sex-sun-sea-and-gigolos-407202.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223010101/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home%2Dnews/women%2Dwho%2Dtravel%2Dfor%2Dsex%2Dsun%2Dsea%2Dand%2Dgigolos%2D407202.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=22 December 2017|archivedate=23 December 2008|dead-url=yes|date=9 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; European, and Australian women who, by all accounts, seem perfectly happy with the arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2440&amp;Itemid=202|title=Bali Beach Gigolos Under Fire|website=Asia Sentinel|date=4 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919121218/http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2440&amp;Itemid=202|archive-date=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNAIDS]] estimate there to be 226,791 prostitutes in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex workers: Population size estimate - Number, 2016 |url=http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/gam/stock/shared/dv/PivotData_2018_7_22_636678151733621264.htm |website=www.aidsinfoonline.org |publisher=UNAIDS |accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
In Indonesia, one of the main reasons for a prostitute to enter the business is the attractiveness of earning money quickly. ''[[The Jakarta Post]]'' reported that high-end prostitutes in [[Jakarta]] could earn Rp 15 million - Rp 30 million (USD 1,755 to 3,510) monthly, able to charge more than Rp 3 million (USD 350) per session for their services. Those entering prostitution for money come from both middle-class and poor families.{{sfn|Tampubolon 2010-11-23, Quick money}}

Another major cause is [[forced prostitution]]. Young women are offered employment opportunities in major cities, then raped and forced to prostitute themselves while paying money to their pimps.{{sfn|Gunawan 2006-05-23, Teen escapes}} They may also be sold by their parents. The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) reports that roughly 70 percent of Indonesian [[child prostitution|child prostitutes]] are brought into the trade by their family or friends.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2005-07-25, Child prostitutes}}

==Forms==
Prostitution exists in many forms and is practiced by many different sexes, [[gender]]s, [[Sexual orientation|orientations]] and ages. Bali, for example, is known for its "Kuta Cowboys", male sex workers who solicit foreign tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Kuta Cowboys' strutting their stuff for lovelorn visitors |date=May 5, 2002 |author=Claire Harvey |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/05/05/039kuta-cowboys039-strutting-their-stuff-lovelorn-visitors.html |accessdate=16 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitution encompasses various sexual orientations.  The most common is heterosexual female prostitution, though [[Transvestism|transvestite]] and male [[homosexual]] prostitution also exist to a lesser extent. [[Child prostitution]] also exists in certain tourism resort islands, such as Batam and Bali. It is estimated that 40,000 to 70,000 Indonesian children engage in prostitution within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Indonesia |publisher=humantrafficking.org |url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/countries/indonesia |accessdate=16 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916135602/http://humantrafficking.org/countries/indonesia |archivedate=16 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitutes sometimes work in [[brothel]]s, some with over 200 prostitutes. The last large [[red-light district]] containing many brothels was Gang Dolly in [[Surabaya]], one of the largest in Southeast Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Battle over Indonesian red-light district |author=Sri Lestari |date=18 June 2014  |newspaper= |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27903426 |accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which closed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/news/dolly-done-se-asias-largest-red-light-district-closes/|title=Gang Dolly Is Done as SE Asia’s Largest Red Light District Closes|newspaper=Jakarta Globe|date=18 June 2014|access-date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitutes can be found in [[discotheque]]s, [[massage parlour]]s, and [[karaoke room]]s,{{sfn|Maryono 2009-07-24, Prostitution fuels}} and also visible on certain [[Street prostitution|streets]]. They can also be booked via telephone.{{sfn|De Suriyani 2010-03-01, Bali faces}}

Online prostitution is also common. In [[internet forum]]s, prostitutes and [[pornography]] are offered to registered members of good standing, as measured by their activity on the forum. A senior member of the forum posts a "free report" offering a description of the member's experience with a prostitute; contact information is provided upon request by private message. Prostitution rings on [[Facebook]] have also been reported.{{sfn|Tampubolon 2011-01-25, Prostitutes and porn}}

==Legal status==
[[File:Prostitution in Indonesia.png|thumb|Number of registered prostitutes in Indonesia, from 1984 to 1995]]
Prostitution is not specifically addressed in the law. However, many officials interpreted "crimes against decency/morality" to apply to prostitution. Prostitution is widespread and largely tolerated, despite its contradiction with popular societal and religious norms{{sfn|USDS: Indonesia}} Prostitution is most visibly manifested in Indonesia’s [[brothel]] complexes, or ''lokalisasi'', which are found throughout the country.{{sfn|Intersections}} These brothels are managed under local government regulations.{{sfn|Catw-Ap 2010-11-22, Facts and Statistics}} During or after raids by the police, the prostitutes are able to pay and be released from custody; this has led to police raids being called "nothing more than an income source for public order officers".{{sfn|Winarti 2008-12-26, Raids on prostitution}}

The Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI) estimates that 30 percent of the prostitutes in Indonesia are below 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rakhmat|first1=Muhammad Zulfikar|last2=Tarahita|first2=Dikanaya|title=Indonesia's Child Trafficking Crisis - Asia Sentinel|url=https://www.asiasentinel.com/society/indonesia-child-trafficking-crisis/|website=Asia Sentinel|accessdate=14 April 2018|date=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ILO puts the total number of child prostitutes in [[Jakarta]] at 5,000; according to the Jakarta city government, this is concentrated in Prumpung ([[North Jakarta]]), Grogol ([[West Jakarta]]) Tanah Abang ([[Central Jakarta]]), Block M ([[South Jakarta]]), as well as Jatinegara and Ciracas (both [[East Jakarta]]).{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2005-07-25, Child prostitutes}}  [[Child sex tourism]] occurs, especially on the resort islands of Bali and [[Batam]].{{sfn|CRIN, Violence study}}{{sfn|Indonesiamatters.com, Bali Sex Tourism}}

==History==
[[File:Masalah 'P' (1952).pdf|thumb|''Masalah "P"'', a 1952 book by the Social Ministry of Indonesia on prostitution]]
One of the earliest reports of prostitution in ancient Indonesia is from a Chinese source. The [[Tang dynasty]] Ch'iu-T'ang shu and Hsin T'ang shu historical records, which originated circa 640 CE, reported that in the country of [[Kalingga Kingdom|Ho-ling]] in Java, there were a number of "poisonous women". Those who had sex with these harlots would suffer festering wounds and die afterwards. This was the earliest record of prostitution and its connection with [[sexually-transmitted disease]] in ancient Java.&lt;ref name="SNI-II:Zaman Kuno"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro |author2=Nugroho Notosusanto | title=Sejarah Nasional Indonesia: Zaman Kuno | url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/sejarah-nasional-indonesia/oclc/318053182 | date=2008 | publisher=Balai Pustaka | isbn=978-9794074084 | language=Indonesian | accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}}

Little is known about precolonial Indonesia's prostitution, although the purchase of [[sexual slavery|sex slaves]] and "quasi-contractual" sexual relations are thought to have occurred. Following the [[spread of Islam in Indonesia]], prostitution is thought to have increased due to Islam's disapproval of [[islamic marital jurisprudence|contractual wedding]]s.{{sfn|Cribb|Kahin|2004|p=357}} Javanese kings kept large stables of [[concubine]]s, while Balinese widows without familial support could be prostituted by their king.{{sfn|Jones|Sulistyaningsih|Hull|1998|pp=29-30}}

[[Serat Centhini]], an early 19th century Javanese manuscript, refers to the prostitution business in Central Java and Yogyakarta. The manuscript describes various sexual positions and techniques mastered by prostitutes in Java in order to satisfy their clients. Serat Centhini also says that there was once a thriving [[brothel]] near the royal tomb of [[Imogiri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.perwara.com/2017/serat-centhini-dan-sejarah-pelacuran-di-yogyakarta/|title=Serat Centhini dan Sejarah Pelacuran di Yogyakarta – Warta Kebangsaan|website=www.perwara.com|language=id-ID|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early Dutch colonial period, European men wishing to find sexual gratification began hiring native prostitutes or [[njai|concubines]]; this was accepted by financially motivated local women as well as some families, who volunteered their daughters. Because [[interracial marriage]] was discouraged or outright forbidden, this arrangement was accepted by Dutch leaders.{{sfn|Jones|Sulistyaningsih|Hull|1998|pp=29-30}}

Widespread prostitution began in the early 1800s, when the number of concubines kept by the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|Royal Netherlands East Indies soldiers]] and [[Dutch East Indies|government officials]] declined; native men leaving their wives to look for work in other areas also contributed to its rise.{{sfn|Cribb|Kahin|2004|p=357}} In 1852 the colonial government began requiring regular health checks of prostitutes to check for [[syphilis]] and other venereal diseases; prostitutes also had to carry identification cards. These did not curb the growth of prostitution, which increased dramatically during a period of extensive construction in the late 1800s.{{sfn|Jones|Sulistyaningsih|Hull|1998|pp=30-32}}

The 1852 law was later replaced by another, more stringent, [[public morality]] law in 1913, which criminalized "purposely bring[ing] about the fornication of others with a third party and make this his profession", or pimping; no mention was made of prostitutes. Enforcement of these laws proved more nearly impossible, and for a period of time investigation of brothels required a permit from the governor.{{sfn|Jones|Sulistyaningsih|Hull|1998|p=32}}

During the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]], existing prostitutes were selected to serve the Japanese army in special brothels. Other women and girls, both native and Dutch, were forced to become "[[comfort women]]". After World War II, the migration of women from remote villages to cities, coupled with a high divorce rate, caused another increase in prostitution.{{sfn|Jones|Sulistyaningsih|Hull|1998|pp=32-34}}

==Response==
Government response to prostitution in Indonesia has been varied. A common response is to attempt banning it and closing brothels.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2006-06-28, Depok working}} Another proposed response is the taxing of prostitutes' fees; such proposals have met controversy, with the revenues being considered ''[[haraam]]''.{{sfn|Fadli 2010-02-17, Legislator proposes}}

==Effects==
Prostitution has been blamed for the increasing [[HIV/AIDS]] rates in various parts of Indonesia, including [[Central Java]]{{sfn|Maryono 2009-07-24, Prostitution fuels}} and Bali. A lack of health control in brothels{{sfn|Maryono 2009-07-24, Prostitution fuels}} and a lack of condom use have been blamed;{{sfn|De Suriyani 2010-03-01, Bali faces}} in 2010 the Bali AIDS commission reported that only 40% of clients used protection.{{sfn|De Suriyani 2010-03-01, Bali faces}}

Prostitutes themselves may fall victim to psycho-social problems, such as [[multiple personality disorder]]. When servicing customers or dealing with their pimps, they may be physically and mentally abused. They are also at risk of catching HIV/AIDS.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2005-07-25, Child prostitutes}}

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Indonesia}}
Indonesia is a major source, and to a much lesser extent, destination and transit country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Each of its 34 provinces is a source and destination of trafficking. Indonesian women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking, primarily in Malaysia, Taiwan, and the Middle East.  Many women and girls are exploited in sex trafficking. Victims are often recruited with offers of jobs in restaurants, factories, or domestic service, but are subjected to sex trafficking. Debt bondage is particularly prevalent among sex trafficking victims. Women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking near mining operations in Maluku, Papua, and Jami provinces. Child sex tourism is prevalent in the Riau Islands bordering Singapore, and Bali is a destination for Indonesians traveling to engage in child sex tourism.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Indonesia 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282673.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=28 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Indonesia as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

== Media controversy ==

In May 2015, Australian magazine ''[[Woman's Day (Australian magazine)|Woman's Day]]'' published a story claiming that Wilson had been misleading about her birth name, age, and upbringing.&lt;ref name="WomensDay"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.womansday.com.au/celebrity/australian-celebrities/will-the-real-rebel-wilson-please-stand-up-12574 |title = Separating fact from fiction: Will the real Rebel Wilson please stand up? |work = [[Woman's Day]] |date = 18 May 2015 |accessdate = 11 July 2015 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150521080051/http://www.womansday.com.au/celebrity/australian-celebrities/will-the-real-rebel-wilson-please-stand-up-12574 |archivedate = 21 May 2015 |deadurl = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson had previously said in interviews that she was raised by dog-training "[[bogan]]" parents in the [[ghetto]] of Sydney, spent a year in Zimbabwe, climbed into a cage with a leopard, got caught in a shoot-out and then struck down by a severe strain of [[malaria]] from a [[mosquito]] in Mozambique where, from her [[Intensive care unit|intensive care]] bed, she envisioned herself winning an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and rapping her acceptance speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://gulfnews.com/life-style/celebrity/hollywood/rebel-wilson-the-beautiful-bogan-1.1509874 |title = Rebel Wilson: the beautiful bogan |first = Guardian News &amp; Media |last = Ltd |date = 13 May 2015 |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her age was also incorrectly given as 29, which she would later admit was something she chose not to correct.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; ''Woman's Day'' called all of this into question and claimed that Wilson had, on the contrary, a "very normal, upper-middle-class upbringing" and "added a touch of 'fantasy' to the life she led before becoming a household name."&lt;ref name="WomensDay" /&gt; The story was picked up by several other publications including ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.people.com/article/rebel-wilson-age-name-melanie-elizabeth-bownds |title = Facts vs. Fibs: Rebel Wilson's Real Age Is 35, Records Confirm |work = [[People (magazine)|People]] |date = 20 May 2015 |first = Tara |last = Fowler |accessdate = 11 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-rebel-wilson-age-20150524-story.html |title = Why would Rebel Wilson lie about her age? |work = [[Chicago Tribune]] |date = 24 May 2015 |first = Justin Wm. |last = Moyer |accessdate = 11 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/19/rebel-wilson-name-age_n_7320604.html |title = Rebel Wilson Responds To Claims She's Lying About Her Name And Age |work = [[The Huffington Post]] |date = 19 May 2015 |first = Stephanie |last = Marcus |accessdate = 11 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, Wilson's true birth date was confirmed through business records filed with the [[Australian Securities and Investment Commission|ASIC]], which were obtained by ''The Sydney Morning Herald''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/ls-celebrity-news/rebel-wilsons-birth-date-revealed-in-asic-documents-20150520-gh5caq |title = Rebel Wilson's Birth Date Revealed in ASIC Documents |work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date = 20 May 2015 |accessdate = 11 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2016, Wilson said print and online articles in ''Woman's Day'', the Australian ''Women's Weekly'', ''[[NW (magazine)|NW]]'' and ''OK!'' magazines made her out to be a serial liar. According to a [[defamation]] writ filed in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], Wilson said her reputation and credit had suffered and she had been humiliated and embarrassed. She also sued for special damages, claiming she missed out on roles and other ones were terminated because of the articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/rebel-wilson-sues-magazine-publisher-over-stories-about-her-age-20160516-gowi9a.html |title = Rebel Wilson sues magazine publisher Bauer Media over stories about her age |last = Ham |first = Larissa |date = 16 May 2016 |work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate = 16 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was represented by [[Matthew Collins (barrister)|Matthew Collins QC]]. On 15 June 2017, a six-person jury ruled in Wilson's favour, finding that publisher [[Bauer Media Group]] had indeed wrongly painted the actress as a serial liar, and that publishing the articles was likely to have caused harm to her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/15/rebel-wilson-wins-defamation-trial-against-bauer-media |title = Rebel Wilson wins defamation trial against Bauer Media |date = 15 June 2017 |work = [[The Guardian]] |accessdate = 17 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2017, Wilson was awarded {{A$|4500000|link=yes}} in damages. Wilson's lawyer Richard Leder, said "Today's verdict is a significant record—it's about four times the highest previous verdict in a defamation case in Australia".

She said that once her film commitments were over, she would start her diet again to reach her target weight of {{convert|80|kg}}.&lt;ref name="StayingBig" /&gt; In February 2013, she confirmed that she had ended her agreement with Jenny Craig the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/rebel-wilson-talks-on-split-with-jenny-craig/story-e6frewz0-1226580846065 |title = Rebel Wilson talks about split with Jenny Craig |last = Christie |first = Joel |date = 19 February 2013 |work = [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher = [[News Limited]] |accessdate = 22 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Wilson stated her support for stricter American gun laws following the [[2015 Lafayette shooting]], stating, "I don't like getting political but America you really have to follow Australia's example re gun laws. I don't remember a mass shooting in Australia since they [[Gun laws in Australia#Port Arthur massacre and its consequences|overhauled the gun laws]].

'''Revolutionary breach of legal continuity''' is a concept in English [[constitutional law]], which rationalises the historic English behaviour when one [[Monarch|King]] (or regime) was deposed and a de facto ruler was recognised as the new de jure monarch (or republican authority). More generally it is any process, unauthorised by an existing legal order, which results in the creation of a new legal order; whether or not the revolutionary change is brought about by violence. A technical breach of continuity might happen when the former constitutional arrangement is so inefficient that there isn't even a practical legal way to amend it.

The most recent successful ''revolutionary breach'' in [[England]] and [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], was the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688-1689 which replaced King [[James II of England]] and Ireland (King James VII of Scotland) with the joint sovereignty of his son-in-law King [[William III of England]] (King William II of Scotland) and daughter Queen [[Mary II of England]] (and Scotland).

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] is another example, as it had no basis in the previous legal order which had governed the thirteen colonies and represented the start of a new legal order. A few years later the replacement of the [[Articles of Confederation]] with the [[United States Constitution]] was a technical breach of continuity, which didn't result in a [[civil war]] only because of the very reason of the breach: the first USA defined by the Articles had a weak central government that therefore had no means to defend itself.

There was an attempted ''revolutionary breach'' in the whole of Ireland in 1919, when the [[First Dáil]], a gathering of persons elected to the [[United Kingdom House of Commons]] in 1918, declared an Irish Republic, without any authority to do so within the terms of the United Kingdom's legal order. The subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and steps taken under it gave the [[Irish Free State]] legitimacy within the United Kingdom legal order, but they delegitimised it for those who regarded the applicable legal order to be that proclaimed in 1919.

When the present constitution of Ireland was adopted the amending formula of the Irish Free State constitution was deliberately not used, despite having the necessary support, so the new constitution would represent a ''revolutionary breach'' and derive its legitimacy from purely Irish sources.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

Similar steps were taken so the Indian people became the source of legitimacy for the republican constitution of [[India]]. The republican constitution replaced the one authorised by the [[United Kingdom]] at the time of independence, but did not comply with its provisions for amendments.

The term has also been applied to regime change following a military coup in [[Commonwealth of Nations]] members such as [[Pakistan]] and [[Nigeria]].

'''Rural parliaments''' are forums for discussion and debate, often established to give voice to rural populations of the country, to influence policy and practice and to develop networks between those in rural areas.&lt;ref name="SAC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sac.ac.uk/mainrep/pdfs/ruralparliamentseuro2012.pdf |title=Rural Parliaments in Europe: A report for the Scottish Government |last=Woolvin |first=Mike |author2=Atterton, Jane |author3=Skerrat, Sarah |date=January 2012 |publisher=Rural Policy Centre, [[Scottish Agricultural College]] |accessdate=25 March 2012 |location=Edinburgh }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been established in [[Estonia]], [[Swedish-speaking Finland]], [[Hungary]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Slovakia]], [[Sweden]], and [[Scotland]] and will soon be established in [[Romania]].

===Scotland===
In March 2012 [[Rural Affairs Secretary]] [[Richard Lochhead]] announced that the [[Scottish Government]] was moving ahead with its plans for a '''Scottish rural parliament''', as outlined in Programme for Scotland 2011-2012.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-17499075 |title=Plans for Scottish rural parliament |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=BBC News Scotland |accessdate=25 March 2012 |location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural Scottish Rural Parliament was held from 6–8 November 2014, in Oban, Argyll &amp; Bute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.scotland.gov.uk/News/Scotland-s-first-Rural-Parliament-90f.aspx|title=ScottishGovernment - News - Scotland’s first Rural Parliament|author=ScottishGovernment|work=scotland.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent organization, Scottish Rural Action, was formed to take forward the proposals. Directors include the chair, John Hutchison of Community Land Scotland, who is a Community Advocate based in the West Highlands.  He also chairs the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust and is former Chairman of the John Muir Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishruralparliament.org.uk/|title=Scottish Rural Parliament –|work=scottishruralparliament.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The themes or topics for the Rural Parliament will be decided by people who live and work in rural Scotland using a survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishruralparliament.org.uk/setting-the-agenda/|title=Setting the agenda|work=scottishruralparliament.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarah Burger Stearns''' (November 30, 1836 – October 26, 1904) was a social reformer and a leader in the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|woman's suffrage]] movement in the U.S. state of [[Minnesota]]. She co-founded the [[Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association]] and served as its first president.

==Early life and education==
Sarah Burger was born in [[New York City]] on November 30, 1836.{{sfn|Willard|1893}} In 1845, her family moved to [[Ann Arbor]], Michigan, and later, to [[Cleveland]], Ohio.{{sfn|Stuhler|1995|p=294}}

Burger showed an early interest in woman's suffrage when she attended a national suffrage convention in Cleveland at age 14 where she heard talks by [[Lucretia Mott]], [[Lucy Stone]], and other national leaders.{{sfn|Stanton|1886|p=527}} In 1858, she organized twelve young women to make the first formal application, by women, for admission to the [[University of Michigan]] in Ann Arbor. The reply they received was "It seems inexpedient, at present, for the University to admit ladies". Discussion continued until 1869 when women (but not Stearns) were admitted.{{sfn|Willard|1893}}

Stearns accepted a position as a [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] teacher in an academy. After a year, she applied to University of Michigan again and was, again, refused. She entered and graduated from the [[State Normal School]] in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]], Michigan.{{sfn|Willard|1893}}{{sfn|Stuhler|1995|p=294}}

In 1863, she married Lieutenant [[Ozora P. Stearns]] whom she had met 5 years earlier. After marriage, while he was in the army, Sarah was [[preceptress]] in a seminary for young women in [[Monroe, Michigan|Monroe]], Michigan. She also lectured for the benefit of the [[Soldiers' aid societies|Soldiers' Aid Societies]] and the [[Sanitary Commission]]. She was invited to give a lecture to the [[Theodore Parker]] Fraternity (a social and religious society) in [[Boston]]; her lecture was titled, "Wrongs of Women and Their Redress ". She also taught [[Freedman|Freedmen]] where her husband (now Colonel Stearns) was stationed.{{sfn|Willard|1893}}

==Women's suffrage in Minnesota==
In 1866, the Stearns's moved from Michigan to [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]], Minnesota, and Sarah continued to give lectures on subjects such as "Woman and Home" and "Woman and the Republic", and wrote newspaper articles on education.{{sfn|Stuhler|1995|p=294}}{{sfn|Willard|1893}}

Stearns and [[Minnesota Woman Suffrage Memorial#Mary Jackman Colburn|Mary Colburn]] (and "friends of equality") petitioned the legislature for an amendment to strike the word ''male'' from the section of the [[Minnesota State Constitution]] which enfranchised "every male person", as a means to provide women with the right to vote. Stearns and Colburn were given a hearing before a legislative committee in 1867 but, ultimately, the bill failed in committee (by a majority of one) and no action was taken.&lt;ref name=stuhler1995&gt;{{cite book|last=Stuhler|first=Barbara|title=Gentle Warriors: Clara Ueland and the Minnesota Struggle for Woman Suffrage|year=1995|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press |location=St. Paul, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-87351-318-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, Susan B. Anthony traveled through the Midwest encouraging women to form local affiliates of the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DuBois|first1=Ellen Carol|title=Feminism and suffrage: the emergence of an independent women's movement in America, 1848-1869|date=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, New York|isbn=978-0-801-48641-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her visit, Stearns and Colburn formed the first suffrage societies in Minnesota: Stearns in Rochester with 50 members and Colburn in [[Champlin, Minnesota|Champlin]].&lt;ref name=stuhler1995 /&gt;

The Stearns's moved to [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], Minnesota, in 1872. Sarah organized another suffrage society, the Duluth Woman Suffrage Circle, and served as its president from 1881–1893. She supported temperance, served as a member of the Duluth [[school board]] for three years, and was the Minnesota vice-president for the [[Association for the Advancement of Women]] for several years.{{sfn|Willard|1893}} Stearns was characterized in a local newspaper as "a power in the young community [Duluth] as well as in the state of Minnesota".{{sfn|Stuhler|1995|p=294}}

In 1875, the Minnesota constitution was amended to allow women of 21 years or older to vote in "any election held for the purpose of choosing any officers of schools, or upon any measure relating to schools, and may also provide that any such woman shall be eligible to hold any office pertaining solely to the management of school".&lt;ref name=slphistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slphistory.org/lwv/ |title=A Summary of women's suffrage in Minnesota |agency=League of Women Voters |work=SLPHistory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629164539/http://slphistory.org/lwv/ |archivedate=June 29, 2016 |accessdate=March 3, 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stearns, and other supporters, made no effort to campaign for votes in favor of the amendment because they were afraid that those efforts would simply rouse the opposition. Shortly before the election, Stearns contacted the editor of the St. Paul Pioneer Press to request support in his paper; the editor admitted that he had forgotten all about the amendment. Stearns and her colleagues persuaded both political parties to phrase the ballot, "For the amendment of Article VII relating to electors–Yes". In order to vote against the amendment, voters had to cross out 'Yes' and write in 'No'. The amendment passed 24,340 to 19,468.{{sfn|Stuhler|1995|p=294}}{{sfn|Stanton|1886|page=653}} As Stearns later stated, "our bitterest opponents forgot the question was to be voted upon, and the ignorant classes who could not, or did not read their ballots, voted unthinkingly for the measure".{{sfn|Stanton|1886|p=653}} After passage of the amendment, Stearns spoke at women's meetings, informing them of their new rights and campaigning for two female candidates from Minneapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13748785/sarah_burger_stearns/ |title=The Ladies Campaign |work=Star Tribune |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |date=March 31, 1876 |accessdate=September 13, 2017 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an amendment to allow women to vote on matters relating to prohibition was voted down in 1877, Stearns and other woman leaders became convinced that a statewide organization was needed to move women's issues forward.&lt;ref name=slphistory /&gt; Fourteen women met in [[Hastings, Minnesota|Hastings]], Minnesota, in 1881, and formed the [[Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association]] (MWSA).{{efn|The charter members of the MWSA were: "Mrs. [[Harriet E. Bishop]], Mrs. Martha Luly, St. Paul; Mrs. A. T. Anderson, Mrs. H. J. Moffit, Mrs. C. Smith, Minneapolis; Mrs. Harriet A. Hobart, [[Julia Bullard Nelson]], Mrs. R. Coons, Red Wing; Sarah Burger Stearns, Duluth; Mrs. L. C. Clarke, Worthington; Mrs. L. G. Finen, Albert Lea; Mrs. K. E. Webster, Mrs. Minnie Reed, Mrs. M. A. VanHoesen, Hastings".{{sfn|Stanton|1886|page=657}}}} Stearns became the first president. The association grew to 124 in its first year and doubled in number in the second year.{{sfn|Stuhler|1995|p=295}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13748297/sarah_burger_stearns/ |title=Woman suffrage in state.

In 1882, Stearns was unanimously re-elected as president of the MWSA at its first annual meeting. In 1883, she stepped down due to ill health but accepted presidency of the Equal Rights League in Duluth.{{sfn|Stanton|1886|pages=658–659}}

==Other activities==
Stearns played a vital role in the organization of a home for destitute women and children in 1885, which eventually developed into the Duluth Children's Home,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/nemhc/id/2340|title=Duluth Children's Home, Duluth, Minnesota :: University of Minnesota Duluth, Kathryn A.

After 5–6 years, a new home was built on property donated by two judges (Stearn's husband and Judge Ensign). The funds to build the home were donated by members of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnhs.org/newspapers/lccn/sn83016458/1911-11-11/ed-1/seq-11 |title=Founder of the children' home and one of the little inmates |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |work=The Duluth Herald |date=November 11, 1911 |accessdate=September 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last years and legacy==
In 1894, the Stearns' moved to California, for Ozora's health. Sarah was chair of the [[Los Angeles]] Suffrage League in 1900, and she continued to work for women's rights until her death on January 26, 1904.{{sfn|Stuhler|1995|p=295}} In her obituary, Stearns is called "one of the most prominent platform orators in the cause of woman suffrage and temperance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13748029/sarah_burger_stearns_obit/ |title=Pioneer woman dead |work=The Austin Daily Herald |date=January 26, 1904 |accessdate=September 13, 2017 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, a memorial garden was built on the grounds of the [[Minnesota State Capitol]], to observe the 75th anniversary of the suffrage movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2008/other/080890.pdf |title=Remembering suffrage |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |work= www.leg.state.mn.us |date=1996 |accessdate=September 13, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107031128/https://www.leg.state.mn.us/docs/2008/other/080890.pdf |archivedate=November 11, 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden exhibit is called ''[[Minnesota Woman Suffrage Memorial|Garden of Time: Landscape of Change]]'', and is planted with native flowers and grasses. A monument in the garden lists the names of 25 women active in the movement, including Stearns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holste|first1=Glenda Crank|title=No Fireworks, Just Pride Bursting in Air|url=http://womensenews.org/2000/08/no-fireworks-just-pride-bursting-air/|website=Women's eNews|accessdate=September 15, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313195821/http://womensenews.org/2000/08/no-fireworks-just-pride-bursting-air/|archivedate=2016-03-13|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3915">The '''Seventeenth [[Council of Toledo]]''' first met on 9 November 694 under King [[Egica]].  It was the king's third council and primarily directed, as was the [[Sixteenth Council of Toledo|Sixteenth]], against the [[Jews]], of whom Egica seems to have had a profound distrust and dislike.

The king opened the synod by claiming that he had heard news of Jews overthrowing their [[Christian]] rulers overseas and that Iberian Jews were conspiring with these cousins to end the Christian religion once and for all.  The council therefore decreed in its eight canon that all Jews, except those in [[Narbonensis]], were to be deprived of their property, which was to be given to their Christian slaves, and enslaved themselves.  Their slavekeepers were chosen by the king and were to be contractually obligated to never allow the practice of the Jewish religion again.  It is, however, almost certain that, in at least some parts of Spain, these regulations were not strictly enforced; though in others, they certainly were.

The council tried to protect the life of Egica's queen and children after his death, knowing the harm which could befall the royal family during a succession, and the bishops ordered prayers said for their souls.

The council's minutes remain the best source of information for its period in Spanish history.

==The eight canons of the synod==
(1) At the beginning of a Synod all the sacerdotes ([[bishop]]s) shall fast for three days in honour of the Holy Trinity, and in this time, without the presence of the laity, hold converse on the doctrines of the faith and on the improvement of the morals of the clergy. After that they shall proceed to other subjects.

(2) At the beginning of Lent, since from that time there are no more baptisms, except in case of extreme necessity, the font shall be sealed by the bishop with his ring, and so remain until the stripping of the altar at the feast of the ''[[Holy Thursday|Coena Domini]]''.

(3) The washing of feet at the feast of the ''Coena Domini'', which has fallen into disuse in some places, must be observed everywhere.

(4) The holy vessels and other ornaments of the Church may not be expended by the clergy for themselves, nor sold, etc.

(5) Some priests hold Masses for the dead, on behalf of the living, that these may soon die. The priest who does this, and the person who induced him to do it, shall both be deposed and forever anathematised and excommunicated. Only on their deathbed may the communion be again administered to them.

(6) All the year through, in all the twelve months, shall ''Exomologeseis'' ([[Litany]]) with intercessions be said for the Church, the King, and the people, that God may forgive them all.

(7) The older laws for ensuring the safety of the royal family are renewed.

(8) As the Jews have added to their other crimes this that they endeavoured to overthrow the country and the people, they must be severely punished. They have done this after they had (in appearance) received baptism, which, however, by faithlessness they have again stained. They shall be deprived of their property for the benefit of the exchequer, and shall be made slaves forever. Those to whom the King sends them as slaves must watch that they may no longer practise Jewish usages, and their children must be separated from them, when they are seven years of age, and subsequently married with Christians.

Shaheen belongs to the [[Afridi|Zakhakhel Afridi]] tribe of the [[Pashtuns]].&lt;ref name="BR"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribal player selected for U-19 cricket team|url=http://fp.brecorder.com/2016/12/20161205110297/|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=[[Business Recorder]]|date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Landi Kotal]], a town in [[Khyber District]], [[Pakistan]], on the border with [[Afghanistan]]. He is the youngest of seven brothers; his eldest brother, 15 years his senior, is [[Riaz Afridi]] who played a solitary [[Test cricket|Test match]] for Pakistan in 2004.&lt;ref name="Afridi8for"/&gt; Shaheen started his cricket career from the Tatara Ground in Landi Kotal, which is named after the nearby Tatara hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1057240/a-rush-of-blood-searching-for-catharsis-in-tatara/|title=Searching for catharsis in Tatara|date=2016-03-02|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Riaz Afridi introduced Shaheen to hard-ball cricket at the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas cricket team|FATA]] Under-16 trials in 2015, with Shaheen having played only [[tennis-ball cricket]] until then.&lt;ref name="PakPassion"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pakpassion.net/ppforum/showthread.php?263391-Talent-Spotter-Shaheen-Shah-Afridi | title=Talent Spotter: Shaheen Shah Afridi (interview, video etc) | publisher=PakPassion | date=31 July 2017 | accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success at this level led Shaheen to selection for the Under-16 tour of Australia in November 2015 where he played his part with four wickets in the 2–1 victories in the One-Day and Twenty20 series.&lt;ref name="PakPassion"/&gt;

[[File:Rastafarian Man In Rasta Cap.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Rastafari]] man in a rasta cap at a port of Jamaica's [[Black River, Jamaica|Black River]].]]
[[Jamaica]] is an island in the [[Caribbean Sea]], located 90 miles south of Cuba, and 100 miles southwest of Haiti. There exist several common '''[[stereotypes]] about [[Jamaican people]]'''.

==Marijuana==
{{Further information|Cannabis in Jamaica}}

[[Marijuana]] is a preparation of the Cannabis plant intended for use as a recreational drug and as medicine. Cannabis is locally known as ''weed'', and internationally Jamaica, its [[reggae music]], and cannabis consumption play a prominent role in Jamaica's public image.&lt;ref name="Veal2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Veal|title=Dub: Soundscapes and Shattered Songs in Jamaican Reggae|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYtiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP33|date=15 August 2013|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0-8195-7442-8|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common stereotype about Jamaicans is that every Jamaican smokes marijuana.

==Rastafari==
While [[Rastafari]] is a common religion among black Jamaicans that look up to the past Ethiopian emperor [[Haile Selassie]], only 3% of the population practices this religion.

==Family size==
The [[population growth rate]] in Jamaica is at 0.7%, and it is considered to be an [[underpopulated]] country. On average, each woman gives birth to two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/jamaica/total_fertility_rate.html|title=Jamaica Total fertility rate - Demographics|year=2013|work=[[IndexMundi]]|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Jamaica is in a lot of debt; [[public debt]] has increased to 140% of the GDP, due to deficits and excessive debt service and borrowing. However, there have been improvements in procedures regarding to starting businesses, foreign investment is more available, and property rights are more secured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/jamaica|title=Jamaica Economy|work=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skin color==
Another stereotype is that all Jamaicans are black, but this is not the case.

The study of the role of [[women]] in particular in the society of [[Anglo-Saxon England]] has been a topic of academic research in history and [[gender studies]] since the 1980s. A seminal study was published by  [[Christine Fell]] as ''Women in Anglo-Saxon England'' in 1984. According to Fell, women were "near equal companions to the males in their lives, such as husbands and brothers, much more than in any other era before modern time".{{sfn|Fell|1987}}{{sfn|Stenton|1990}} Despite this sense of equality in some strata of society, Anglo Saxon women were still subject to [[concubinage]].&lt;!-- This equal status prevailed until the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, at which point a military society re-envisioned women as unimportant.{{sfn|Fell|1987}}{{sfn|Stenton|1990}}--&gt;
Gender was influenced by social status, religion and sexuality.{{sfn|Pasternack|2003}}{{clarify|date=November 2014}}&lt;!--what does this even mean and how is it not a universal tautology?--&gt;
They were not only allowed to have private influence, but also a wide liberty of intervention in public affairs.{{sfn|Stenton|1990}}

== Occupations ==
Women and children were generally involved in tasks that required little physical work. Though, due to climate and weather constraints, women may have done the work that needed attention at the time.{{sfn|Fell|1987}}{{clarify|date=November 2014}}&lt;!--the bibliography has 1984--&gt;
{{page needed|date=November 2014}} While men were ox-herders, labourers, swine-herders, and so forth, women were cheese-makers&lt;ref name="Carol Hough 1999"&gt;Carol Hough (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and dairy-maids.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} They were also bakers, though not cooks. In [[Old English]] the word for cook is ''coc'', and is only found in the masculine form, while ''baecere'' and ''bascestre'' respectively represent the feminine and masculine forms of baker.{{sfn|Fell|1987}}{{sfn|Hough|1999}} Female slaves were corn-grinders, serving maids, wet-nurses, weavers, and seamstresses.{{sfn|Hough|1999}} Common free women may have been found spinning as well as weaving.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} Women and ladies, including queens, would serve drinks for company and family. This was not only a job for a woman of lower-class,{{sfn|Fell|1987}} though it would have likely been done by a low-class woman if one were present. Women of this time were also entertainers, comedians, and singers, and may have been employed by households or travelling groups.{{sfn|Fell|1987}}

== Christianity ==

Churches in Anglo-Saxon England stressed doctrines that preached about virginity as a virtue and faithful monogamy; this is believed to have limited an individual’s chances of acquiring status, political power and property.{{sfn|Pasternack|2003}} Anglo-Saxon England was the first place in history that women had been raised to [[saint]]hood, and this was the strongest immediately following the acceptance of Christianity.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} Christianity provided lots of freedom for women. It helped them become powerful in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Holt Literature Language Arts|last=|first=|publisher=Holt Rinehart and Winston|year=2003|isbn=0-03-056498-0|location=Houston, Texas|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the church women appeared to have been equal as well there are evidences of anti-feminism found in Homilies.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} Although anti-feminism was found in Homilies, it does not seem to hold true in practice.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} Women who went into the convent and took vows of [[poverty, chastity and obedience]] were glorified in the eyes of the Church and its Fathers.{{sfn|Fredrick Ide|1983}} The convent offered self-development and social responsibility to women, something that women are fighting for today.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} Uniquely, the Anglo-Saxon church had institutions that consisted of male and female monasteries, located together but segregated, and in these the female abbot had the headship of the institution.  Convents were run by abbesses, and this was an opportunity for women to have a position of authority.{{sfn|Hough|1999}} They were responsible for the finances and managing the property, with some the help of the other nuns.&lt;ref name="Carol Hough 1999"&gt;Carol Hough (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This control that women had did not survive the Viking invasion of 789,{{sfn|Blair|1984}} although women continued to play a major role in the church in late Anglo-Saxon England.{{sfn|Hough|1999}} Single gendered convents and monasteries had the chores that were commonly done by the other sex would have been performed by the common sex in that location; examples are men would have worked in the kitchens of monasteries and women would have worked in the gardens of nunneries.{{sfn|Fell|1987}}

It is clear that there were equal opportunities for men and women in the Christian Church in Anglo-Saxon England, but it is still important to look at the "Patriarchs of the Bible."{{sfn|Pasternack|2003}} Although women were given these opportunities it is crucial that they were given them by men and that the Church's significant positions of authority were held by men. Thus the gender differences and coping with the ideological conflicts that have to do with sexuality and kinship resulted from the introduction of Christianity.{{sfn|Pasternack|2003}}

== Marriage and divorce ==
In Anglo-Saxon England, there were many laws related to marriage.&lt;ref name="Carol Hough 1999"&gt;Carol Hough (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians{{which?|date=May 2016}} profess that the law that neither widow, nor maiden was forced to marry a man that she disliked as being a sign of equality; however, Aethelberht's law contradicts this in as much as a man is legally allowed to steal another man's wife as long as he pays him reparation.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} Once married, a woman was to situate herself as the object of her husband's subjectivity, she was to become the object of his protection and the property, although she still remained the owner of her property.{{sfn|Pasternack|2003}} The Church saw that married women had no authority and were to stand under the lordship of men. Therefore, under the church they were not able to teach, witness, take an oath, nor be a judge.{{sfn|Fredrick Ide|1983}} In marriage, a male often developed his sphere of influence through his wife.{{sfn|Pasternack|2003}} Although women were seen as such under the church, there were laws that protected them in the public sphere when married. Divorce was rare, and the only documented ones were in times of adultery.{{sfn|Hough|1999}} A woman that commits adultery by sleeping with a man that was not her husband while he was still alive was subject to give what she owned to her husband.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} [[Ethelred the Unready|Æthelraed]]'s 1008 code states that widows shall remain unmarried for 12 months after the death of her husband, at which point they have the freedom to choose.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} This was likely the case to allow for the widows have time to think and not make any rash decisions which may have led to relationships or commitments.

A prospective husband had to offer his wife a valuable gift called the ''morgengifu'', a “morning-gift,” which consisted of paying money or giving land for the ladies’ hand in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Holt Literature and Language Arts, Sixth Course|last=|first=|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|year=2003|isbn=0030564980|location=Houston, Texas|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was paid to her directly and she had the right to do with it as she pleased. It is made clear that the marriage finances were held by both man and woman. A woman was free to leave a marriage, keeping in mind the only times divorce was documented in cases of adultery; and if the woman did leave and take the children, she was entitled to half the property.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} These gifts were substantial sums and generally property.{{sfn|Fell|1987}}&lt;ref name="Carol Hough 1999"&gt;Carol Hough (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The gifts given by the groom were sometimes viewed as a sale of the bride, when, in actuality, it was to safeguard her interests and add security.{{sfn|Hough|1999}}

== Sexual mores ==
According to the church sexual desires were evil and sinful, thus appeared as so; therefore women were not to enjoy sex.{{sfn|Fredrick Ide|1983}} Many times sex was not gentle, because it was a sense of security for the man and not meant to please the woman.{{sfn|Fredrick Ide|1983}} When it came to paying for sex with a woman belonging to the King she would have cost roughly 30 shillings, while a commoner only 6 shillings.&lt;ref name="Shari Horner 2004"&gt;Shari Horner (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of money for sex shows that there was the presence of prostitution, although it is not clearly stated whether the women condoned the act or not, and this issue is still up for debate; what is known is that there was a sex trade in some form.{{sfn|Fell|1987}}&lt;ref name="Shari Horner 2004" /&gt; The fact that rape of a slave was more expensive than seduction of a free woman shows how rape was viewed so negatively in society, although the law protected women against both actions.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} Laws of [[King Alfred|Ælfred]] go into great detail regarding laws about sexual assaults.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} An example of the law committed by a man was [[Æthelbald of Mercia|King Æthebald]] of Mercia who was punished for numerous reasons, including violating holy nuns who were virgins consecrated to God.{{sfn|Pasternack|2003}} When compensation was paid a free woman, [[churl|ceorl]] or ranked above, she collected the money directly, and the money for slaves went to their owner.  It is also unclear as to whether the wife or husband received the money for their servants.{{sfn|Fell|1987}}&lt;ref name="Carol Hough 1999"&gt;Carol Hough (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Rape as a topic is important because it relates to gender relations, class status, property rights, judicial customs, female agency, religious virtues of integrity of the body and representation in of all of these in a society.&lt;ref name="Shari Horner 2004" /&gt; Sexual assaults were greatly penalized whether it was a slave or free woman.{{sfn|Hough|1999}} Burials suggest that a raped body was unceremonious.&lt;ref name="Dawn Hadley 2004"&gt;Dawn Hadley (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; A few documents suggest that some men of this era applauded other men who beat their wives and that some men even thought that a wife should be beaten regularly; this may have been condoned by clergy.{{sfn|Fredrick Ide|1983}} Even though there were laws protecting women that had been raped, sometimes the acts went unpunished for lack of information or time. The victim herself may not have told  anyone until many years after, or no one really took an interest in the crime if the victim was of the serving class.{{sfn|Fredrick Ide|1983}}

Sex and rape were also found in literature.&lt;ref name="Shari Horner 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn Hadley 2004" /&gt; There are actual and threatened acts of violent sexual assaults present in some literature and legal texts;&lt;ref name="Shari Horner 2004"&gt;Shari Horner (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn Hadley 2004" /&gt; an example is the homily of Wulfstan, a text in which he wrote about women being raped at the hands of the Vikings.&lt;ref name="Shari Horner 2004" /&gt;

== Laws ==
The written law only represents a portion of the laws that impacted the lives of women; therefore they only reflect partial views of what actually happened.&lt;ref&gt;Mary P Richards and B. Jane Stanfield. (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite what the churches doctrines taught, women were considered to be a member of the state and their rights were protected, regardless of their status as maiden, widow or wife.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} Women were classed as oath worthy and could appear as grantors, grantees and witnesses of [[Anglo-Saxon charters|charters]].&lt;ref name="Carol Hough 1999"&gt;Carol Hough (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Women were held responsible and accountable under the law for their activity, although were not held accountable for any criminal activity that her husband did, unless she was a willing accessory to the crime.{{sfn|Fell|1987}}{{sfn|Hough|1999}} Along with being law abiding, they received appropriate compensation for crimes that were committed against them, and the compensation was paid directly to them.{{sfn|Fell|1987}}

==Wills==
Women had property rights and many landowners were women.&lt;ref name="Carol Hough 1999"&gt;Carol Hough (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; They were able to bequeath land, as shown in numerous wills. Leaving property by means of a will was not restricted to kin; it could also be left to servants, religious figures, and churches.{{sfn|Stenton|1990}} Documents of wills and charters show that women owned estates, by virtue of grant, will, or inheritance, and that they were seen roughly equal in the common life of the countryside.{{sfn|Stenton|1990}}{{sfn|Hough|1999}} Evidence in these documents shows no preference to daughters or sons as heirs.&lt;ref name="Carol Hough 1999"&gt;Carol Hough (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; [[churl|Ceorl]] women and others of high rank were responsible for their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, Carol. "Women." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England. Ed. Lapidge et al. 1999. 485-487.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the items that women would commonly receive via trust or inheritance were real property estates, slaves, livestock, household furnishings, clothing, jewels, and books.{{sfn|Hough|1999}} Items such as table clothes, bed sheets, and wall hangings were considered women's property because women made them.{{sfn|Fell|1987}}

== Health ==
Anglo-Saxons had warnings for pregnant women, including avoiding foods that were too salty or sweet, pork, and other fatty foods. They were also told to abstain from strong alcohol and too much drink and to avoid travel on horseback.{{sfn|Fell|1987}} If a woman were to stop menstruating supposedly due to a lack of nutrients and was not pregnant, she was to take hot baths, drink hot herb teas, and dress warmly.{{sfn|Fell|1987}}

'''Zurich University of the Arts''' (ZHdK, {{lang-de|'''Zürcher Hochschule der Künste'''}}) has approximately 2,500 students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK)|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/component/members/view/110|work= cumulusassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes it the largest arts university in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Departement Design &amp; Art Education Zurich University of the Arts|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/component/members/view/110|work= cumulusassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was established in 2007, following the merger between Zurich’s School of Art and Design (HGKZ) and the School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT). ZHdK is one of four universities affiliated to [[Zürcher Fachhochschule]].

ZHdK offers Bachelor’s and master's degree courses and further education programmes in [[art]], [[design]], [[music]], [[art education]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[dance]], transdisciplinary studies as well as PhD programmes in collaboration with different international Art Uniuversities and with [[ETH Zurich]]. ZHdK holds an active role in research, especially in artistic research and design research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zürcher Hochschule der Künste|url=http://www.eenc.info/fr/organisation/zurich-university-of-the-arts/|work= eenc.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affiliated to ZHdK are the [[Museum of Design, Zurich]], the Theater der Künste (Theatre of the Arts), the Mehrspur Music Club, and the Media and Information Centre (MIZ).

== History ==
Established on 1 August 2007, Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) resulted from the merger between the [[Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst Zürich]] (HGKZ), which had arisen from the [[Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich]] (founded in 1878), and the School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zurich University of the Arts Universities Handbook |url=http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-zurich/zurich-university-of-the-arts |work= universitieshandbook.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501144050/http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-zurich/zurich-university-of-the-arts |archivedate=May 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding president of the new arts university was Professor Hans-Peter Schwarz. Since November 2009, Professor Thomas D. Meier has been president of ZHdK.

The Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst Zürich (HGKZ) arose from the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] Zürich (founded in 1878). It was located in a building constructed by architects Adolf Steger and Karl Egender, which today also houses the [[Museum of Design, Zurich]].

The School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT) was the result of a merger in 1999 between Winterthur and Zurich conservatories of music, Zurich’s Jazz School, Zurich’s Theatre and Acting Academy, and the Swiss Professional Ballet School. ZHdK’s programme in Theatre Studies (affiliated to the Department of Performing Arts and Film) was originally established in 1937, in the context of the [[Schauspielhaus Zürich]] (the city’s principal theatre), and known as the  Bühnenstudio Zürich. It was renamed Schauspiel-Akademie Zürich in the early 1970s.

Following the 2007 school merger, ZHdK occupies 35 sites, spread across the cities of Zurich (Ausstellungsstrasse, Florhof, Mediacampus, Gessnerallee) and Winterthur. In the autumn of 2014, ZHdK will be relocating to its new campus: the Toni Areal (under construction) in the city’s thriving western district ([[Zurich West]]). With the exception of its Gessnerallee annex, ZHdK will be leaving all other sites to unite the arts under one roof. The [[Museum of Design, Zurich]] and the Bellerive Museum will remain at their current locations.

== Teaching and research ==
ZHdK offers taught Bachelor’s and master's degree courses, which have replaced the former diploma courses in the wake of the [[Bologna Process]]. Places on all degree courses are limited. The university also offers a foundation course in art and design and various further educating courses, leading either to a Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) or a Master of Advanced Studies (MAS).

With research becoming more firmly established at universities of applied sciences, ZHdK has significantly intensified its research activities. Its seven research institutes and two centres of excellence focus on artistic research in particular. Research is also undertaken in the fields of [[design]], [[art history]], art education, and [[musicology]]. And, ZhdK is also running several joint PhD programmes in cooperation with national and international universities.

== Departments ==
ZHdK has five departments:

The '''Department of Music''' is the largest department at ZHdK. It provides instrumental and voice training in Classical, Jazz, and Popular Music, as well as programmes in conducting and composition.
