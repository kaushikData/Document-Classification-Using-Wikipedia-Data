[[File:MUTCD D9-21.svg|right|125px]]
In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], the '''711''' [[telephone number]] is used for the [[Telecommunications Relay Service]] to [[translate]] from [[Telecommunications devices for the deaf|TDD]] for the [[deaf]] to [[Speech communication|speech]], and vice versa.  The [[relay]] service allows [[deaf]] people to converse with the [[hearing (person)|hearing]] over the phone through an [[operator (profession)|operator]].  711 is one of eight [[N11 code]]s for [[abbreviated dialing]] in the [[North American Numbering Plan]].

==Requirement==
In the U.S., every [[phone company]] is required to connect persons who dial 711 to a TRS [[call center]] from a working number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FCC MANDATES NATIONWIDE IMPLEMENTATION OF 711 ACCESS TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS RELAY SERVICES (TRS) |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/News_Releases/2000/nrcc0038.html |publisher=U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] |date=July 21, 2000 |accessdate=May 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] ruled that the 711 requirement extended to [[VOIP]] [[telephony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DISABILITY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS EXTENDED TO VOIP SERVICES |url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-273452A1.pdf |format=PDF  |publisher=U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] |date=May 31, 2007 |accessdate=May 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4547">The '''American Music Performance Invitational for Mixed Choirs''' refers to a series of [[music festivals]] for top [[school]] choirs.  The festivals are more commonly referred to as the '''AMP Invitationals.'''  Produced by '''Choirs of America (COA)''', the inaugural AMP Invitational took place in Long Beach and Los Angeles on April 29-30, 2011.  COA's stated mission is "to ''engage, inspire'' and ''educate'' choirs across the country."  COA was recently named a "Citizen Musician" as part of the Citizen Musician Initiative fronted by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], music director [[Riccardo Muti]] and [[Yo-Yo Ma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://citizenmusician.org/CitizenMusiciansAndTheirActivities/CitizenMusicians]&lt;/ref&gt;  Wenger Corp is COA's title sponsor.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.wengercorp.com/Home/partners.html] &lt;/ref&gt;

Workshop presenters included Broadway producer [[Ken Davenport]], motivational speaker Norm Hull, David Sears (senior director of education at the GRAMMY Foundation) and Terry Knowles (president and CEO of the [[Los Angeles Master Chorale]]).

The event culminated in a massed choir benefit concert with master conductor [[Eric Whitacre]] leading over 630 high school singers from three different states in a program that raised over $3,600.00 for L.A.'s Harmony Project.  Participants included top mixed high school choirs from [[Branham High School#Music department| Branham]], [[Calabasas High School | Calabasas]], [[Chino Hills High School | Chino Hills]], [[Highland High School (Gilbert, Arizona)#Choirs| Highland]], [[Monte Vista High School (Danville, California) | Monte Vista]], [[Porterville High School | Porterville]], [[Sprague High School#Choir| Sprague]], [[Thomas Downey High School#Singing| Thomas Downey]], [[Tualatin High School | Tualatin]], [[Westwood High School (Mesa, Arizona) | Westwood]] and [[Valencia High School (Santa Clarita, California)#Valencia High School Choir| Valencia]].  Highland High School from Gilbert, Arizona earned the coveted top rated choir slot (Monte Vista came in second, with Sprague placing third).&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.facebook.com/pages/AMP-Invitational/129015030469109] &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Avicenna Directory was merged with the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED) to create the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]]. This new directory was launched in April 2014.&lt;ref name="wdoms.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdoms.org/about/|title=World Directory of Medical Schools {{!}} About|website=www.wdoms.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was named after [[Avicenna]], a Persian physician and philosopher born near [[Bukhara]] in the 10th century.

==AVICENNA Directory for medicine==
The AVICENNA Directory for medicine was a public database of worldwide medical schools. It replaced the WHO World Directory of Medical Schools in 2008.&lt;ref name='a'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avicenna.ku.dk/History/ |title=History – University of Copenhagen |publisher=Avicenna.ku.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The WHO published the World Directory of Medical Schools from 1953–2007. The seventh and final print edition of the directory was published in 2000&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. World Directory of Medical Schools. 7th edn. Geneva. WHO 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and listed around 1700 schools in 162 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=International recognition of basic medical education programmes |last1=Karle |first1=H |journal=Medical Education |date=January 2008 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=12–7 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2007.02907.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000-2007, the WHO published the directory electronically, along with updates received after the 2000 print publication. In August 2007, the WHO signed an agreement with the University of Copenhagen to transfer responsibility for development and maintenance of the directory.&lt;ref name='a' /&gt; In March 2008, the AVICENNA project was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gordon | first1 = D. | last2 = Christensen | first2 = L. | last3 = Dayrit | first3 = M. | last4 = Dela | first4 = F. | last5 = Karle | first5 = H. | last6 = Mercer | first6 = H. | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60431-6 | title = Educating health professionals: The Avicenna project | journal = The Lancet | volume = 371 | issue = 9617 | pages = 966 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18358912| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 2008, the contents of the World Directory of Medical Schools were transferred to the AVICENNA Directory for medicine.&lt;ref name='a' /&gt;

In 2013, the AVICENNA Directories merged with the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED) to create the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]].&lt;ref name="wdoms.org"/&gt;

The '''Bangla Academy''' ({{IPA-bn|baŋla ækaɖemi|pron}}) is Bangladesh's national language authority, established in 1955. It is located in Burdwan House in [[Ramna]], [[Dhaka]], within the grounds of the [[University of Dhaka]] and [[Suhrawardy Udyan]].

The Bangla Academy hosts the annual [[Ekushey Book Fair]].

==History==
[[File:Moder Gorob (Front View).JPG|thumb|right|''Moder Gorob'', depicting the language movement martyrs, is one of the features of Bangla Academy]]

The importance of establishing an organisation for Bengali language was first emphasised by the linguist [[Muhammad Shahidullah]].&lt;ref name="alhelal"&gt;{{cite book |last= Al-Helal |first= Bashir |title= Bangla Academy'r Itihaas (History of Bangla Academy) |year= 1986 |publisher= Bangla Academy |location= Dhaka, Bangladesh |language= Bengali}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="muntasir.mamun:smriti"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mamun |first= Muntasir |title= Dhaka: Smriti Bismritir Nogori |origyear= 1993 |edition= 3rd edition, 4th printing |date=January 2004 |publisher= Ananya Publishers
|location= Dhaka, Bangladesh |language= Bengali |isbn= 984-412-104-3 |pages=178–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, following the [[Bengali Language Movement|Language movement]], on 27 April 1952, the All Party National Language Committee decided to demand establishment of an organisation for the promotion of Bengali language. During the 1954 parliamentary elections, the [[United Front]]'s 21-point manifesto stated that, "The prime minister from the [[United Front]] will dedicate the Bardhaman House for establishing a research center for the Bengali language".&lt;ref name="muntasir.mamun:smriti" /&gt; Following the election success of the Front, the education minister Syed Azizul Haque placed the order to fulfill this promise.

In 1955, the government formed a committee to expedite the process. The committee was composed of leading intellectuals like Muhammad Shahidullah, [[Qazi Motahar Hossain]], S.M. Bhattacharya, W. H. Shadani, and [[Muhammad Barkatullah]]. On 3 December 1955, the Chief Minister of [[East Bengal]], [[Abu Hussain Sarkar]], inaugurated the institute.&lt;ref name="muntasir.mamun:smriti" /&gt; Barkatullah acted as the Special Officer in charge. Later, in 1956, [[Muhammad Enamul Haque]] took over as the first director.&lt;ref name=bpedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Sirajul |year=2012 |chapter=Bangla Academy|chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Academy |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last= Helal |editor2-first=Bashir Al|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, an act of the parliament formally established the funding source and the Government support for the institute.&lt;ref name="muntasir.mamun:smriti" /&gt; The first book published by the academy was [[Layla and Majnun|Laili Maznu]], an epic by the medieval poet [[Dawlat Ujir Bahram Khan]], and edited by [[Ahmed Sharif]]. The first fellow of the academy was the poet [[Farrukh Ahmed]].&lt;ref name="muntasir.mamun:smriti" /&gt;

The publication division was established in early 1957; the research, culture and library divisions and translation division were set in 1958 and 1961 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://banglaacademy.org.bd/site/detail_view/72/%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B8 |title=বাংলা একাডেমির সংক্ষিপ্ত ইতিহাস |access-date=11 August 2016 |language=Bengali|website=Bangla Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[History of Bangladesh after independence|the independence of Bangladesh]], the director's position was renamed Director General.&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt; [[Mazharul Islam (poet)|Mazharul Islam]], head of Bangla Department of [[Rajshahi University]], was the first Director General of the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reporter|title=Bangla Academy marks 54th founding anniv today|url=http://www.dhakamirror.com/city-news/bangla-academy-marks-54th-founding-anniv-today/|website=Dhaka Mirror|publisher=New Age BD|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 19 September 2008, a new 8-storied building, containing a 500-capacity auditorium and a 100-capacity seminar room, opened next to the main building.

==Structure==
The functions and structure of the institute was devised on the model of the [[Académie française|French Academy]].&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt;

'''Cambridge University International Development''' or '''CUiD''' is a student run society aiming to promote awareness and discussion of [[international development]] issues across Cambridge.  This is primarily achieved through events, a thrice yearly publication, Vision and the global network U8.  CUiD also has links with the twice yearly Cambridge International Development Course (IDC) and is a member of [[The Humanitarian Centre]].

== History ==

CUiD was founded in 2005 by Sheena Sumaria, a student of [[St John's College, Cambridge]] with the goal of 'Raising awareness and increasing understanding of the issues surrounding International Development'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuid.org/ CUID - Cambridge University International Development&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and since then has been rapidly expanding every year.  Now its membership base is nearly 600 with a central committee of at least 25.  CUiD is headed by two co-presidents who are elected by its members every academic year.

== Events ==

CUiD runs a series of events predominantly scheduled in the Michaelmas and Lent terms of the [[University of Cambridge]].  They include the following:
* Speaker events.  Academics, professionals, media figures and others give their views on topics relating to international development.  Previous speakers include Gerison Lansdown for [[UNICEF]], Ko Aung on campaigning for human rights and democracy in Burma, Andrew Swinells on the Rwandan genocide and the search for justice, Richard Baker for [[Oxfam]] and many more.  Many of these are available as audio recordings on [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuid.org/ 24/08/09&lt;/ref&gt;
* Panel debates.  Designed to provoke discussion, and highlight differing opinion. Previous debates include "Corporate (Ir)responsibility?" and "Gap Year, Crap Year?"
* Film showings, sometimes followed by a speaker.  Previous films include [[Médecins Sans Frontières|MSF]]'s "Invisibles" and [[WORLDwrite]]'s "Corruptababble"
* Discussion forums.  To encourage everyone to air their opinion and discuss informally the issues surrounding international development.
* Socials.  To create a network within Cambridge and to encourage a wider social group to get involved.

== Vision ==

Vision is CUiD's termly magazine which deals with concerns relating to international development.  It is usually themed around a particular topic, for example "drugs and development" and is predominantly written by Cambridge University students.  To view past editions go to [http://www.cuid.org CUiD's webpage]

== U8 ==

[[Image:U8 Development.jpg|thumb|U8 logo]]
CUiD is a founding member of the [[U8 Global Student Partnership for Development|U8]].  The U8 is a global network to link universities across the world to promote dialogue and share ideas.

== 2009 ==

2009 was Cambridge's 800th Anniversary, which CUiD celebrated with a special event and publication: Vision - Assessing our Legacy.  This encompassed an art exhibition and an inaugural speech by Professor [[Keith Hart (anthropologist)|Keith Hart]] entitled "International Development: a Historical Perspective from Cambridge".

Furthermore CUiD hosted the Cambridge International Development Summit (CIDs),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srcf.ucam.org/camidc/CIDS2009/CMS/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 24/08/09&lt;/ref&gt; whose speakers included Nick Dyer, Director of Policy, [[Department for International Development]].

The '''Centre for Digital Media''' (CDM) is a multidisciplinary graduate institution based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It offers a Master of Digital Media (MDM) program accredited by its four partner institutions, the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Simon Fraser University]], [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design|Emily Carr University of Art + Design]] and the [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]].
[[File:Cdm_logo.png|thumb|The Centre for Digital Media logo]]

==Master of Digital Media==

The Master of Digital Media (MDM) program is the first jointly credentialed academic program offered at the Centre for Digital Media on the [[Great Northern Way Campus]]. It is the first professional graduate program in digital media to be offered in Canada.&lt;ref name="http://thecdm.ca/"&gt;[http://mulpix.com/][http://thecdm.ca/program/mdm Centre for Digital Media Website | Master of Digital Media]&lt;/ref&gt;

This full-time graduate degree program was launched in September 2007 with an initial cohort of 21 students. The 5th cohort of students graduated in September 2012, bringing the total number of graduates to date to 131.  Approximately 60% of the graduates have been international students.

The 16-month MDM program is accredited by all four GNWC partners, and the certificates earned upon graduation bear the seals of The University of British Columbia, The British Columbia Institute of Technology, Emily Carr University of Art + Design, and Simon Fraser University.

The Master of Digital Media (MDM) program was designed and established to develop work-ready, professional talent for Vancouver's digital media industry. The curriculum, facilities and structure of the courses were developed with input from industry partners throughout Vancouver's digital media sector, such as Electronic Arts, Microsoft, Disney Interactive Studios, Annex Pro, Autodesk, Zynga, Relic Entertainment, Rainmaker Entertainment Inc., Nokia, Microsoft, IBM Canada, GRAND NCE, Clark Wilson LLP, Blast Radius. The goal of the curriculum is to produce graduates with a flexible repertoire of skills, rather than a single specialization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130119175451/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/business/story.html?id=581a0739-b778-4db2-a72d-556f24520885 'Digital dormitory' to transform False Creek neighbourhood]&lt;/ref&gt;

The curriculum includes a combination of supervised project coursework for the first 12 months and internships for the final four months. Students work in interdisciplinary groups with both faculty members and industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdm.gnwc.ca/programs Masters of Digital Media Programs Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104225353/http://mdm.gnwc.ca/programs |date=January 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses include Foundations of Digital Media, Foundations of Game Design, The Visual Story, and 'Projects' courses of increasing scope and complexity. Professionals from Vancouver's digital media industry serve as guest speakers and mentors, and industry partners offer internships, scholarships, and practical project opportunities for students.

The program is backed by a 2006 grant of CAD$40.5 million from the Province of British Columbia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/media/releases/2006/mr-06-021.html |title= $40M for New Program Gives BC Competitive Edge in Digital Entertainment Industry, Media Release, UBC Public Affairs, Feb. 22, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828081605/http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/media/releases/2006/mr-06-021.html |archivedate= 2006-08-28 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by a 2007 commitment of CAD$1 million from the US computer game firm Electronic Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnwc.ca/media/2007may03_vcrsun_digital_program_gets_1_million_boost_from_ea%20.pdf|title=Digital program gets $1-million boost from EA, Vancouver Sun, May 03, 2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also charges students $10,000 per semester ($15,000 for non-Canadians).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdm.gnwc.ca/?q=faq#FAQprogramcost "How much does the program cost?"  MDM website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301104146/http://mdm.gnwc.ca/?q=faq#FAQprogramcost |date=March 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justifying this expense, the Trusts's first CEO, Bruce Clayman, described it as "premium tuition for a premium program."&lt;ref name="Second Life lands B.C. campus"&gt;Randy Shore, [http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=4fae259d-f1a1-4858-b664-7ba7bebcf150 "Second Life lands B.C. campus"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207140542/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=4fae259d-f1a1-4858-b664-7ba7bebcf150 |date=December 7, 2007 }}.  ''Vancouver Sun'' (October 18, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; To defray such costs, the Centre for Digital Media offers student scholarships valued at $5000 and $10,000 each, as well as a variety of awards that grant students rent-free accommodations on the Great Northern Way Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mdm.gnwc.ca/scholarships |title=Masters of Digital Media Scholarships and Awards |access-date=2012-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818053206/http://mdm.gnwc.ca/scholarships |archive-date=2012-08-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program won some media attention in 2007 for using the [[Second Life]] virtual world as a recruiting tool,&lt;ref name="Second Life lands B.C. campus"/&gt; as well as for class activities, open houses and other live streamed events on their virtual campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitybusiness.com/article/second-life-higher-education A Second Life for Higher Education?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The MDM program is housed in the Centre for Digital Media, a multimedia facility located in a former office building. As of September 20, 2012, the program will move into the New Centre for Digital Media building to be known as CDM 685 after its 685 Great Northern Way address.  In addition to 76 student housing units, this 49,000 square foot building includes a 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) filming area and green screen, editing and filmmaking labs, and classrooms equipped with "full Dolby 5.1 capabilities, high-end wall projectors, Blu-ray playback."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://mdm.gnwc.ca/place/centre-digital-media Masters of Digital Media|Centre for Digital Media Facilities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916043535/http://mdm.gnwc.ca/place/centre-digital-media |date=September 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry projects==

Industry projects are the key component of the Master of Digital Media program. Students work in project teams to create products for industry partners and must stay within the time, resource and management constraints that characterize professional work schedules in the digital media industry. The team must both prototype and produce a tangible result.&lt;ref name="mdm.gnwc.ca"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://mdm.gnwc.ca/program/mdm |title=Center for Digital Media Website {{!}} Master of Digital Media |access-date=2012-01-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120110053351/http://mdm.gnwc.ca/program/mdm |archive-date= 2012-01-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Projects courses, teams of three to six students work on a focused project (or several, smaller related projects) during that semester. The primary objective of the courses is to provide a hands-on working experience with teammates who are from different backgrounds and disciplines, as well as familiarize students with industry expectations and prepare them for  careers in the digital media sector by immersing them in real-world, team-based scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mdm.gnwc.ca/courses/dmed521/projects-ii |title=Center for Digital Media Website {{!}} Master of Digital Media Projects Course Description |access-date=2012-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911185406/http://mdm.gnwc.ca/courses/dmed521/projects-ii |archive-date=2012-09-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each team must comprise students from both technological and non-technological backgrounds. During the course of the project, students having an engineering or other technical background are expected to make an  aesthetic contribution to the project and students having an artistic grounding are expected to make a technical contribution to the project. The work must be overseen by a faculty member approved by the MDM program for this project.

Students also have the opportunity to pitch their own ideas for projects, mimicking the early stages of managing their own startups.

==Industry partners==

The Master of Digital Media (MDM) program was designed with input from industry partners throughout Vancouver's digital media sector. These industry partners continue to collaborate with the Centre for Digital Media by providing internships, sponsorships, collaborative projects and prototype development opportunities for students. Industry partners also connect with students as guest lecturers, mentors, and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://mdm.gnwc.ca/industry |title=Center for Digital Media Website {{!}} Industry Partners |access-date=2012-01-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120101162827/http://mdm.gnwc.ca/industry |archive-date= 2012-01-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Startups==

The Centre for Digital Media allows students to pick client project or pitch project for their third term. Students who opt for pitch project have to form a team of 3-5 members and submit a project proposal for approval by the faculty. Once approved, each pitch project team has to present in front of a panel of faculty, industry leaders and investors. After the presentation, the panel approves teams for pitch project term.

There are a multiple projects which went on to venture internship period, fourth term, which acts as an incubator space at the Centre for Digital Media.

== Research==

Christian Dustmann's research interests include various topics within [[labour economics]], including [[Human migration|migration]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[education]].&lt;ref name="Christian Dustmann"/&gt; Many of Dustmann's contributions to research in these areas are summarized in his edited volume on the [[economics of education|economics of education and training]] (with [[Bernd Fitzenberger]] and [[Stephen Machin]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/b/spr/stemec/978-3-7908-2022-5.html Dustmann, C., Fitzenberger, B., Machin, S. (2008, eds.). ''The Economics of Education and Training''. Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.]&lt;/ref&gt; his chapter on migration and education with [[Albrecht Glitz]] in the ''Handbook of the Economics of Education''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444534446000043 Dustmann, C., Glitz, A.

=== Research on the economics of migration===

==== The economics of temporary and return migration====

One of the most important topics within Dustmann's research on migration concerns [[circular migration|return migration]] (a.k.a. temporary migration). Using [[Socio-Economic Panel|SOEP]] data, Dustmann finds that immigrants' duration of stay in [[Germany]], i.e. whether or not they immigrate permanently, affects the convergence of natives' and immigrants' earnings as permanent immigrants' tend to invest more into country-specific [[human capital]] and, under certain circumstances, immigrants with higher ability are more likely to immigrate permanently.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jopoec/v6y1993i2p153-68.html Dustmann, C. (1993). Earnings Adjustment of Temporary Migrants. ''Journal of Population Economics'', 6(2), pp. 153-168.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Dustmann argues that governments need to clarify as early as possible whether permanent immigration is possible and under which conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1344525?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Dustmann, C., Bentolila, S., Faini, R. (1996). Return migration: The European experience. ''Economic Policy'', 11(22), 213-250].&lt;/ref&gt; In further work (partly with Oliver Kirchkamp), Dustmann finds that return migration is affected by the relative volatility of labour markets in host and home countries and migrants' precautionary savings,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v52y1997i2p295-316.html Dustmann, C. (1997). Return migration, uncertainty and precautionary savings. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 52(2), pp. 295-316.]&lt;/ref&gt; by their education and the family bounds they have established prior to emigration (for [[Turkish Guest Workers]]),&lt;ref name="ideas.repec.org"&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v67y2002i2p351-372.html Dustmann, C., Kirchkamp, O. (2002). The optimal migration duration and activity choice after re-migration. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 67(2), pp. 351-372.]&lt;/ref&gt; by the number and sex of children they have had in the host country,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jopoec/v16y2003i4p815-830.html Dustmann, C. (2003). Children and return migration. ''Journal of Population Economics'', 16(4), pp. 815-830.]&lt;/ref&gt; and by the wage differentials between Germany and their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eecrev/v47y2003i2p353-369.html Dustmann, C. (2003). Return migration, wage differentials, and the optimal migration duration. ''European Economic Review'', 47(2), pp. 353-369.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he and Kirchkamp observe that the majority of returnees from Germany to Turkey among [[Turkish Guest Workers]] remained economically activity, typically as entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="ideas.repec.org"/&gt; With regard to the [[United Kingdom|UK]], Dustmann and [[Yoram Weiss]] explore how price differentials between the UK and migrants' home countries, migrants' preference to live in their home countries, and better opportunities to accumulate valuable human capital in the UK determine return migration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/brjirl/v45y2007i2p236-256.html Dustmann, C., Weiss, Y. (2007). Return Migration: Theory and Empirical Evidence from the UK. ''British Journal of Industrial Relations'', 45(2), pp. 236-256.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in research with Josep Mestres, Dustmann finds that changes in return plans are related to large changes in immigrants' remittances to their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v92y2010i1p62-70.html Dustmann, C., Mestres, J. (2010). Remittances and return migration. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 92(1), pp. 62-70.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, along with Itzhak Fadlon, Weiss and Dustmann use a [[Roy model]] to explore the effect of return migration and skill-specific human capital accumulation on the [[brain drain]] in migrants' home countries, which may instead experience a "brain gain" if enough emigrants return after having strongly improved their skills abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v95y2011i1p58-67.html Dustmann, C., Fadlon, I., Weiss, Y. (2011). Return migration, human capital accumulation, and the brain drain. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 95(1), pp. 58-67.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The effect of immigrants' host country language skills====

A second major area of research in Dustmann's work on migration relates to the effect of immigrants' host country language proficiency. Among else, he finds that fluency in German among immigrants increases in education, is lower for the elderly and women, and is only improved by labour market participation in the case of speaking. He also finds that immigrants' fluency in both speaking and especially writing German is associated with higher earnings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jopoec/v7y1994i2p133-56.html Dustmann, C. (1994). Speaking Fluency, Writing Fluency and Earnings of Migrants. ''Journal of Population Economics'', 7(2), pp. 133-156.]&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, Dustmann observes that immigrants' acquisition of speaking and writing fluency is mostly driven by their parents' education level, whereas living in areas with high concentrations of immigrants has only a moderately negative effect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/quaeco/v37y1997isupplement1p245-262.html Dustmann, C. (1997). The effects of education, parental background and ethnic concentration on language. ''Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance'', 37(Supplement), pp. 245-262.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, migrants' investments into language proficiency are shown to depend on whether migrants' intend to immigrate permanently or temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/scandj/v101y1999i2p297-314.html Dustmann, C. (1999). Temporary Migration, Human Capital, and Language Fluency of Migrants. ''Scandinavian Journal of Economics'', 101(2), pp. 297-314.]&lt;/ref&gt; In work with [[Arthur van Soest]], Dustmann finds that the effect of language proficiency on immigrants' earnings was likely underestimated by earlier studies as the downward bias due to measurement errors in subjective language proficiency dominates the upward bias due to heterogeneity in terms of unobserved ability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v83y2001i4p663-674.html Dustmann, C., van Soest, A. (2001). Language Fluency and Earnings: Estimation with Misclassified Language Indicators. ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', 83(4), pp. 663-674.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/sae/ilrrev/v55y2002i3p473-492.html Dustmann, C., van Soest, A. (2002). Language and the Earnings of Immigrants. ''ILR Review'', 55(3), pp. 473-492.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, together with Francesca Fabbri, Dustmann documents that language acquisition and labour market performance vary widely across non-white immigrants in the UK based on their ethnic origins and that English proficiency significantly increases immigrants' likelihood of employment and earnings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v113y2003i489p695-717.html Dustmann, C., Fabbri, F. (2003). Language proficiency and labour market performance of immigrants in the UK. ''Economic Journal'', 113(489), pp. 695-717.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Natives' attitudes towards immigration====

Together with [[Ian Preston]], Dustmann has analysed the attitudes of ethnic majorities towards [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]]. Among else, they find that earlier research in the UK likely overestimated the positive impact of local immigration on natives' attitudes towards immigrants because they omitted the tendency of xenophobic natives to move to locations with few migrants; instead, they find that, if anything, high concentrations of ethnic minorities likely exacerbated xenophobia in England.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v111y2001i470p353-73.html Dustmann, C., Preston, I. (2001). Attitudes to Ethnic Minorities, Ethnic Context and Location Decisions. ''Economic Journal'', 111(470), pp. 353-373.]&lt;/ref&gt; With [[David Card]], they also find that xenophobic attitudes among European natives are mainly driven by concerns over how changes in the composition of the local population due to immigration may affect amenities from neighbourhoods, schools and workplaces, instead of concerns over wages and taxes, thus explaining why individuals with lower education tend to display more xenophobic attitudes, as they benefit relatively more from these public amenities than highly educated people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jeurec/v10y2012i1p78-119.html Card, D., Dustmann, C., Preston, I. (2012). Immigration, Wages, and Compositional Amenities. ''Journal of the European Economic Association'', 10(1), pp. 78-119.]&lt;/ref&gt; This dominance of welfare concerns over labour market concerns is also supported by earlier work on the UK, though racial and cultural prejudice also plays an important role there, if immigrants have a different ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/bejeap/v7y2007i1n62.html Dustmann, C., Preston, I.P. (2007). Racial and Economic Factors in Attitudes to Immigration. ''B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis and Policy'', 7(1), pp. 1-41.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The effects of immigration on host countries and immigrants====

A fourth area in Dustmann's research on migration studies the impact of immigration on domestic labour markets. Therein, together with Fabbri and Preston, Dustmann finds that while immigration in Britain ''overall'' doesn't appear to have an effect on British natives' employment, labour force participation, unemployment, and wages, immigration in fact likely decreased the employment of medium-skilled natives and increased that of high-skilled natives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v115y2005i507pf324-f341.html Dustmann, C., Fabbri, F., Preston, I. (2005). The Impact of Immigration on the British Labour Market. ''Economic Journal'', 115(507), pp. 324-341.]&lt;/ref&gt; In further work with [[Albrecht Glitz]] and [[Tommaso Frattini]], Dustmann studies how European countries' labour markets adjusted to recent immigration through changes in factor prices, output mix and production technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/oxford/v24y2008i3p478-495.html Dustmann, D., Glitz, A., Frattini, T. (2008). The labour market impact of immigration. ''Oxford Review of Economic Policy'', 24(3), pp. 478-495.]&lt;/ref&gt; This research is further complemented by work with Glitz, [[Yann Algan]] and [[Alan Manning]] that compares the performance of first- and second-generation immigrants in [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in terms of education, earnings and employment,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v120y2010i542pf4-f30.html Algan, Y. et al. (2010). The Economic Situation of First and Second-Generation Immigrants in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. ''Economic Journal'', 120(542), pp. 4-30.]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by research with Frattini and Gianandrea Lanzara which shows that even though second-generation immigrants tend to perform worse than natives in terms of education, immigration has a strongly positive on their education relative to that of their peers in their home country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ecpoli/v27y2012i69p143-185.html Dustmann, C., Frattini, T., Lanzara, G. (2012). Educational achievement of second-generation immigrants: an international comparison. ''Economic Policy'', 27(69), pp. 143-185.]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Dustmann, Frattini and Caroline Halls have also analyzed the fiscal effects of immigration in the UK, finding that European immigrants in general and especially immigrants from post-2004 EU Member States have made consistently positive contributions to the UK's public finances between 1995 and 2011, though the opposite holds true for [[European Economic Area|non-EEA]] immigrants, in particular before 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ifs/fistud/v31y2010i1p1-41.html Dustmann, C., Frattini, T., Halls, C. (2010). Assessing the Fiscal Costs and Benefits of A8 Migration to the UK. ''Fiscal Studies'', 31(1), pp. 1-41.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/econjl/v124y2014i580pf593-f643.html Dustmann, C., Frattini, T. (2014). The Fiscal Effects of Immigration to the UK. ''Economic Journal'', 124(580), pp. 593-643.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, together with Frattini and Preston, Dustmann finds that immigrants' move to the UK generally results in a considerable downgrade of their position within the wage distribution, which then in turns depresses slightly wages among the bottom fifth of native workers but increases wages for the upper half.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/restud/v80y2013i1p145-173.html Dustmann, C., Frattini, T., Preston, I.P. (2013). The Effect of Immigration along the Distribution of Wages. ''Review of Economic Studies'', 80(1), pp. 145-173.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other research in labour economics===

In parallel to his research on the economics of migration, Dustmann has also performed influential research on various other topics in labour economics, including wages, job benefits, education, and structural change:
* Addressing the issue of [[endogeneity (econometrics)|endogeneity]] in education, experience and hours worked, Dustmann and van Soest find consistently positive private-public wage differentials in Germany;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eecrev/v42y1998i8p1417-1441.html Dustmann, C., van Soest, A. (1998). Public and private sector wages of male workers in Germany. ''European Economic Review'', 42(8), pp. 1417-1441.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dustmann and [[Uta Schönberg]] find no evidence that expanding [[maternity leave]] coverage in Germany improved children's educational outcomes, though it strongly decreased mothers' probability to return to work;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aejapp/v4y2012i3p190-224.html Dustmann, C., Schönberg, U. (2012). Expansions in Maternity Leave Coverage and Children's Long-Term Outcomes. ''American Economic Journal'', 4(3), pp. 190-224.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dustmann, Glitz and Schönberg explore how referral-based job networks lead to German firms' tendency to workers from certain ethnic groups the higher the share of the firm's workers that are already from that group, with such referral-based hires typically earning higher workers and being less likely to quit;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/restud/v83y2016i2p514-546..html Dustmann, C. et al. (2016). Referral-based Job Search Networks. ''Review of Economic Studies'', 83(2), pp. 514-546.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dustmann, van Soest and Najma Rajah find that reducing class size in [[England]] and [[Wales]] increases individuals' future wages by strongly increasing students' likelihood of staying in school after the end of [[compulsory schooling]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v113y2003i485pf99-f120.html Dustmann, C., van Soest, A., Rajah, N. (2003). Class Size, Education, and Wages. ''Economic Journal'', 113(485), pp. 99-120.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dustmann, Schönberg and Johannes Ludsteck argue [[skill-biased technological change]] increased [[Economic inequality|inequality]] at the top of the German wage distribution in the 1980s and 1990s, whereas they attribute the growth of inequality at the bottom of the wage distribution to a combination of de-unionization and the increase in the relative supply of low-skilled workers following [[German reunification]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v124y2009i2p843-881..html Dustmann, C., Ludsteck, J., Schönberg, U.

'''Coding House''' was a [[coding bootcamp]] in [[Silicon Valley]], [[California]]. The 14-week-long bootcamp taught students [[JavaScript]] and other technologies. Founded in 2014 by Nicholas James, it was ordered shut down in November 2016 by the regulatory agency [[California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education]] (BPPE) for violating [[law of California|California law]] many times. BPPE denied Coding House's licensing application three times and found that Coding House had engaged in [[false advertising]].

==History==

Coding House was founded in 2014 by Nicholas James.&lt;ref name="McBride2016-12-06"&gt;{{cite news |last=McBride |first=Sarah |date=2016-12-06 |title=Want a Job in Silicon Valley?

In September 2016, Coding House mandated that students sign non-disparagement contracts disallowing them from either publicly or privately criticizing the school. If Coding House determined that students had originated damaging information about it, Coding House vowed to take action against the students.&lt;ref name="McBride2016-12-06"/&gt;

===Shutdown===
The [[California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education]] (BPPE), which is tasked with regulating California coding schools, declined to add Coding House to its list of approved programs.&lt;ref name="McBride2016-12-06"/&gt; It first warned Coding House in a [[cease and desist]] in January 2014 that it was unlicensed to operate as a coding bootcamp.&lt;ref name="2014-03-10"&gt;{{cite news |date=2014-03-10 |title=Editorial: California's coding-camp crackdown |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/california-604718-coding-camps.html |newspaper=[[Orange County Register]] |accessdate=2016-12-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6n6y8r4W5?url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/california-604718-coding-camps.html |archivedate=2016-12-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BPPE rejected Coding House's applications in November 2015, in June 2016, and on November 4, 2016. On November 7, 2016, the BPPE levied a $50,000 fine on Coding House founder Nicholas James and mandated that James close the school. BPPE further decreed that Coding House reimburse every single student who had enrolled in the school. Coding House filed an appeal but discontinued classes in the meantime.&lt;ref name="McBride2016-12-06"/&gt;

BPPE shut the school down because it found Coding House had committed many contraventions of [[law of California|California law]].&lt;ref name="Marro2016-12-22"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marro |first=Enrico |date=2016-12-22 |title=Coding bootcamp, il sogno di un lavoro da 100mila euro |language=Italian |url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/mondo/2016-12-21/coding-bootcamp-sogno-un-lavoro-100mila-euro-171600.shtml |newspaper=[[Il Sole 24 Ore]] |accessdate=2016-12-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6n6y9IT13?url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/mondo/2016-12-21/coding-bootcamp-sogno-un-lavoro-100mila-euro-171600.shtml |archivedate=2016-12-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BPPE determined that Coding House had engaged in [[false advertising]]. Coding House said on its website that 95% of its alumni received employment by two months after completing the curriculum and that their average starting salary was $91,000. However, BPPE found that just 57 of Coding House's 70 graduates had provided details about their jobs and salaries. The school had 21 companies in a "Where Our Graduates Work Now" part of its website. However, BPPE determined from an analysis of Coding House's records that just two alumni had been hired by either of the 21 companies. BPPE ruled that Coding House contravened home-occupation permit rules by functioning in residential neighborhoods. BPPE additionally found that at Coding House a male student had [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] a female student while people were drinking alcohol.&lt;ref name="McBride2016-12-06"/&gt;

[[wm2012:GLAM Night Out|The Sponsored Point of View]] panel discusses this problem in 2012]]

[[Conflicts of interest]] (COIs) often arise in [[academic publishing]]. Such conflicts may or may not cause wrongdoing, but make it more likely. Academic publishing has some ethical standards in place for avoiding and handling conflicts of interest, and is continuing to develop new standards. Standards vary between journals and are unevenly applied. According to the [[International Committee of Medical Journal Editors]], "Authors have a responsibility to evaluate the integrity, history, practices and reputation of the journals to which they submit manuscripts."&lt;ref name=ICMJE_recommendations_2015/&gt;

Conflicts of interest make research bias more likely. Both disclosed and undisclosed conflicts of interest can harm research quality and the public good.&lt;ref name=registries_RIPR_2016/&gt; Conflicts of interest can involve research sponsors, authors, journals, journal staff, publishers, and peer reviewers.

== Avoidance, disclosure, and tracking ==
[[File:No-coi.png|thumb|Some COIs may be prohibited]]
Avoiding conflicts of interest, and changing the structure of institutions to make them easier to avoid, are frequently advocated. Some institutional ethics policies ban academics from entering into specific types of COIs, for instance by prohibiting them from accepting gifts from companies connected to their work.&lt;ref name=report_NAC_2009/&gt; Education in ethical COI management is also a tool for avoiding COIs.&lt;ref name=report_NAC_2009/&gt;

Disclosure of conflicts of interest has been debated since the 1980s; there is a general consensus favouring disclosure.&lt;ref name=registries_RIPR_2016/&gt; However, there is also a view that COI concerns and some measures to reduce them are excessive.

Criticisms of disclosure policies include:
*authors disclosing COIs may feel pressure to present their research in a more biased manner to compensate&lt;ref name=registries_RIPR_2016/&gt;
*disclosure may discourage beneficial academic–industry collaboration&lt;ref name=outrage_NEJM_2015/&gt;
*disclosure may decrease public trust in research&lt;ref name=outrage_NEJM_2015/&gt;
*researchers who have disclosed their COIs may feel [[Moral licensing|license]] to behave immorally&lt;ref name=outrage_NEJM_2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=interface_BMJ_2015/&gt;
*disclosure may be taken as a sign of honesty or expertise, and thus increase trust&lt;ref name=outrage_NEJM_2015/&gt;
*some types of COI may be more likely to go unnoticed or unreported&lt;ref name=outrage_NEJM_2015/&gt;
*awareness of a COI does not make people immune to being influenced by bias; generally, people do not discount biased advice sufficiently.&lt;ref name=outrage_NEJM_2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=interface_BMJ_2015/&gt;
*disclosure discourages the judging of work purely on its merits&lt;ref name=outrage_NEJM_2015/&gt;
*disclosure causes more intense scrutiny for wrongdoing&lt;ref name=outrage_NEJM_2015/&gt;

While disclosure is widely favoured, other COI management measures have narrower support. Some publications hold that certain COIs disqualify people from certain research roles; for instance that testing medicines should be done only by people who neither develop medicines nor take funding from their manufacturers.&lt;ref name=registries_RIPR_2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=interface_BMJ_2015/&gt;

Conflicts of interest have also been considered as a statistical factor [[confounding]] evidence, which must therefore be measured as accurately as possible and analysed, requiring machine-readable disclosure.&lt;ref name=registries_RIPR_2016/&gt;

== Codes of conduct ==
Journals have individual ethics policies and codes of conduct, but there are also some cross-journal voluntary standards.

The [[International Committee of Medical Journal Editors]] (ICMJE) publishes ''Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly work in Medical Journals'', and a list of journals who pledge to follow it. The guideline lays down detailed rules for conflict-of-interest declaration by authors. It also says: "All participants in the peer-review and publication process — not only authors but also peer reviewers, editors, and editorial board members of journals — must consider their conflicts of interest when fulfilling their roles in the process of article review and publication and must disclose all relationships that could be viewed as potential conflicts of interest."&lt;ref name=ICMJE_recommendations_2015/&gt; The Recommendations have been criticised and revised to remove loopholes allowing the non-disclosure of conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name=manipulate_PLOS_2011&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001072| volume = 8| issue = 8| pages = –1001072| last = Matheson| first = Alastair| title = How Industry Uses the ICMJE Guidelines to Manipulate Authorship—And How They Should Be Revised| journal = PLOS Medicine| accessdate = 2018-04-07| date = 2011-08-09| url = http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Science Editors]] publishes a White Paper on publication ethics. Citing the ICMJE that "all participants in the peer-review and publication process must disclose all relationships that could be viewed as potential conflicts of interest", it highly recommends COI disclosure for sponsors, authors, reviewers, journals, and editorial staff.&lt;ref name=CSE_recommendations/&gt;

The Good Publication Practice (GPP) guidelines, covering industry-sponsored medical research only, are published by the International Society of Medical Publication Professionals.&lt;ref name=GPP/&gt;

The [[Committee on Publication Ethics]] (COPE) publishes a code of conduct, stating that "There must be clear definitions of conflicts of interest and processes for handling conflicts of interest of authors, reviewers, editors, journals and publishers, whether identified before or after publication"&lt;ref name=COPE_core/&gt;

The [[Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association]]'s ''Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing'' is intended to separate legitimate journals from [[predatory publishers]],&lt;ref name=WAME_predatory/&gt; and lays out a minimal standard: clear COI policies, clearly stated.&lt;ref name=line_OASP_2013/&gt;

A 2009 US [[Institute of Medicine]] report on medical COIs states that conflict of interest policies should be judged on their proportionality, transparency, accountability, and fairness; they should be effective, efficient, and targeted, known and understood, clearly identify who is responsible for monitoring, enforcement, and amendment, and apply equally to everyone involved. Review by conflict-of-interest committees is also recommended, and the lack of transparency and COI declaration in developing COI guidelines criticized.&lt;ref name=report_NAC_2009/&gt;

Journal COI policies often have no enforcement provisions, as of 2015.&lt;ref name=Japan_BMJ_2015/&gt; COI disclosure obligations have been legislated, such as in the US [[Physician Payments Sunshine Act]], but not specifically for journals.&lt;ref name=report_NAC_2009/&gt;

== COIs by agent ==
=== COIs of journals ===
These are institutional COIs. They cannot, therefore, be altered simply by replacing the people facing them.

Journals are often not [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]] about their institutional COIs, and apply stricter disclosure standards to authors than to themselves.&lt;ref name=visibility_PLOS_2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=COImedJ_PLOS_2010/&gt; Four out of six major general medical journals contacted for a 2010 COI study refused to provide information on the proportion of their income from advertisements, reprints, and industry-supported supplements, citing policies on non-disclosure of financial information.&lt;ref name=COImedJ_PLOS_2010/&gt;

==== Owners and governing bodies ====
Journals are more likely to accept papers by authors who work at the journals' hosting institutions.&lt;ref name=ingroup_SSRN_2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=favouritism_IHE_2018/&gt; This may be due to conflicts with social interests or institutional loyalties. The owner of an academic journal has ultimate power over hiring and firing of editorial staff;&lt;ref name=sacking_JGIM_1999/&gt; editors' interests in pleasing their employers conflict with some of their other editorial interests.&lt;ref name=judging_QJM_2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=editors_PLOS_2010/&gt;

Some journals are owned by publishers. When journals run book reviews of books published by their own publisher, they rarely (as of 2003) add COI disclosures.&lt;ref name=reviews_SEE_2003/&gt; The publisher's legal obligations to maximize profit conflict with any interests behind profit-lowering decisions. In the case of [[closed-access]] publications, the publisher's desire for high subscription income may conflict with an editorial desire for broader access and readership. There have been multiple mass resignations of editorial boards over such conflicts,&lt;ref name=independence_OAD/&gt; often followed by the editorial board founding a new nonprofit journal to compete with their former one ([[Elsevier#Resignation of editorial boards|examples]]).&lt;ref name=compete_Wilson_2016/&gt;

Some journals are owned by academic societies and professional organisations. Leading journals can be very profitable,&lt;ref name=branding_CMAJ_1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=editors_smith_2010/&gt; and there is often friction between the journal and the member society that owns it over revenue.&lt;ref name=branding_CMAJ_1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=branding_CMAJ_1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=sacking_JGIM_1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=editors_smith_2010/&gt; Some academic societies and professional organizations are themselves funded by membership fees and/or donations. If the owners benefit financially from donations, the journal has a conflict between its financial interest in satisfying the donors, and therefore the owners, and its journalistic interests. Such COIs with industry donors have drawn criticism.&lt;ref name="Food Politics COI"/&gt;

==== Reprints ====
A [[reprint]] is a copy of an individual article,&lt;ref name=FDA_reprint/&gt; printed and sold as a separate product by the journal (or its publisher or agent).&lt;ref name=COImedJ_PLOS_2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=judging_QJM_2002/&gt; Reprints are often used in [[pharmaceutical marketing]] and other [[medical marketing]] of products to doctors.&lt;ref name=FDA_reprint/&gt; This gives journals an incentive to produce good marketing material.&lt;ref name=COImedJ_PLOS_2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=judging_QJM_2002/&gt; Journals sell reprints at high very profit margins, often around 70%, as of 2010. A journal may sell a million dollars' worth of reprints of a single article, if, say, it is a large industry-funded clinical trial.&lt;ref name=editors_smith_2010/&gt; It is thus unsurprising that selling reprints can bring in over 40% of a journal's total income.&lt;ref name=COImedJ_PLOS_2010/&gt;

==== Impact factors, reputation, and subscriptions ====
The [[impact factor]] of a journal is often used to rate the journal, although this practice is widely criticized. A journal will generally want to increase its impact factor, in hope of more subscriptions, better submissions, and more prestige.&lt;ref name=editors_smith_2010/&gt; As of 2010, industry-funded papers generally get cited more than others, likely partly due to industry-paid publicity.&lt;ref name=COImedJ_PLOS_2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=editors_PLOS_2010/&gt;

If a journal is accused of managing COIs badly, its reputation is harmed.&lt;ref name=feuds_ProPublica_2016/&gt;

==== Advertising ====
Many academic journals contain advertising. The proportion of a journal's revenue coming from advertising varies widely, according to one small study from over 50% to 1%.&lt;ref name=COImedJ_PLOS_2010/&gt; As of 2010, advertising revenues are generally falling for academic journals.&lt;ref name=editors_smith_2010/&gt; A 1995 survey of North American journal editors found that 57% felt responsible for the honesty of the pharmaceutical ads they ran, and 40% supported peer-review of such ads.&lt;ref name=judging_QJM_2002/&gt; An interest in increasing ad revenue can, therefore, conflict with interests in journalistic independence and truthfullness.

==== Sponsored supplements ====
As of 2002, some journals publish [[Supplement (publishing)|supplements]], which often either cover an industry-funded conference or are "symposia" on a given topic. These supplements are often subsidized by an external sponsor with a financial interest in the outcome of research in that field (for instance, a drug manufacturer or food industry group). Such supplements can have guest editors,&lt;ref name=ICMJE_recommendations_2015/&gt; are often not peer-reviewed to the same standard as the journal itself, and are more likely to use promotional language.&lt;ref name=judging_QJM_2002/&gt; Many journals do not publish sponsored supplements.&lt;ref name=COImedJ_PLOS_2010/&gt; Small-circulation journals are more likely to publish supplements than large, high-prestige journals.&lt;ref name=ghost_JAMA_1998/&gt; Indications that an article was published in a supplement may be fairly subtle; for instance, a letter "s" added to a page number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nestle |first1=Marion |title=Food company sponsorship of nutrition research and professional activities: a conflict of interest? |journal=Public Health Nutrition |date=2 January 2007 |volume=4 |issue=05 |doi=10.1079/PHN2001253 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/0DC05EE7794D352882D2F089111A0449/S1368980001001069a.pdf/food_company_sponsorship_of_nutrition_research_and_professional_activities_a_conflict_of_interest.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICMJE code of conduct specifically addresses guest-editor COIs: "Editors should publish regular disclosure statements about potential conflicts of interests related to their own commitments and those of their journal staff. Guest editors should follow these same procedures." It also states that the usual journal editor must maintain full control and responsibility, and "Editing by the funding organization should not be permitted."&lt;ref name=ICMJE_recommendations_2015/&gt;

The [[US Food and Drug Administration]] states that supplement articles should not be used as medical-marketing reprints, but as of 2009, had no legal authority to prohibit the practice.&lt;ref name=FDA_reprint/&gt;

==== Publishers ====
Publishers may not be strongly motivated to ensure the quality of their journals. In the ''[[Australasian Journal of Bone &amp; Joint Medicine]]'' case, the printer [[Elsevier]] Australia put out six journal-like publications containing articles about drugs made by the [[Merck Group]], which paid for and controlled the publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== COIs of journal staff ===
Personal conflicts of interest faced by journal staff are individual, and if a person leaves the journal, their personal COIs will go with them (unlike the COIs of journals as institutions).

COIs of journal staff are less commonly reported than those of authors, as of 2015.&lt;ref name=Japan_BMJ_2015/&gt; For instance, one 2009 World Association of Medical Editors (WAME) policy document states that "Some journals list editors’ competing interests on their website but this is not a standard practice."&lt;ref name=WAME_COI_policy/&gt; However, the ICMJE requires that the COIs of editors and journal staff be regularly declared and published.&lt;ref name=ICMJE_recommendations_2015/&gt;

One 2017 [[Physician Payments Sunshine Act|Open Payments]] study of influential US medical journals found that half of the editors received payments from industry;&lt;ref name=payments_BMJ_2017/&gt; another, using a different sample of editors, made it two-thirds.&lt;ref name=payments_Retraction_Watch_2017/&gt; As of 2002, there is often not a system for reporting wrongdoing by editors.&lt;ref name=judging_QJM_2002/&gt;

Many journals have policies on what COIs staff can enter into; for instance, accepting gifts of travel, accommodation, or hospitality may be prohibited. Such policies are rarely published as of 2006.&lt;ref name=wouldsaythat_JRSM_2006/&gt; Most journals do not offer COI training, and many report wanting better guidance on COI policy, as of 2015.&lt;ref name=Japan_BMJ_2015/&gt;

=== COIs of peer reviewers ===
The ICJME recommendations require peer reviewers to disclose conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name=ICMJE_recommendations_2015/&gt; Half to two-thirds of journals (depending on subject area) did not follow this recommendation in the first two decades of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=TP_reviewCOI/&gt; As of 2017, if a peer reviewer fail to disclose a conflict of interest, the paper will generally not be withdrawn, corrected, or re-reviewed, but the reviews may be reassessed.&lt;ref name=undisclosed_reviewer_RetractionWatch_2017/&gt;

If peer reviewers are anonymous, their COIs cannot be published. Some experiments with publishing the names of reviewers have been undertaken; in others, the identities of reviewers were disclosed to authors, allowing authors to identify COIs.&lt;ref name=flaw_JRSM_2006/&gt; Some journals now have an [[open review]] process, in which everything, including the peer reviews and the names of the reviewers, and editor and author comment, is published transparently online.&lt;ref name=payments_BMJ_2017/&gt;

The duties of peer review may conflict with social interests or institutional loyalties. To avoid such COIs, reviewers may be excluded if they have some forms of COI, such as having collaborated with the author.&lt;ref name=TP_reviewCOI/&gt;

=== COIs of article authors ===
[[academic authorship|Authors of individual papers]] may face conflicts with their duty as an author to report truthfully and impartially. Financial, career, political, and social interests are all sources of conflict.&lt;ref name=WAME_COI_policy/&gt; Authors' institutional interests become sources of conflict when the research might harm the institution's finances, or offend the author's superiors.&lt;ref name=report_NAC_2009/&gt;

Many journals require authors to self-declare their conflicts of interest when submitting a paper; they also ask specific questions about conflicts of interest. The questions vary substantially between journals.&lt;ref name=wouldsaythat_JRSM_2006/&gt; However, author declarations are rarely verified by the journal. As of 2018, "most editors say it’s not their job to make sure authors reveal financial conflicts, and there are no repercussions for those who don’t".&lt;ref name=skindeep_reuters_2018/&gt; Even if a conflict of interest is reported by a reader after publication, COPE does not suggest independent investigation, as of 2017.&lt;ref name=verification_COPE_2017/&gt;

As a result, as of 2018, authors with conflicts of interest often simply do not declare them.&lt;ref name=correcting_NYT_2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=skindeep_reuters_2018/&gt; Rates of nondisclosure vary widely in reported studies.&lt;ref name=registries_RIPR_2016/&gt;

The COPE retraction guidelines state that "Retractions are also used to alert readers to... failure to disclose a major competing interest likely to influence interpretations or recommendations"&lt;ref name=COPE_retractions_2009/&gt; However, as of 2018, if an author fails to disclose a COI, the paper will usually be corrected;&lt;ref name=authorban_RetractionWatch_2017/&gt; it will usually not be retracted.&lt;ref name=tried_RetractionWatch_2018/&gt; However, paper retractions, notifications to superiors, and publication bans are possible. Non-disclosure incidents harm academic careers.&lt;ref name=authorban_RetractionWatch_2017/&gt; Authors are held to have collective responsibility for the contents of an article;&lt;ref name=ICMJE_authorship/&gt; if one author fails to declare a conflict of interest, the peer review process may be deemed compromised, and the whole paper retracted.

Public registries of author COIs have been suggested.&lt;ref name=registries_RIPR_2016/&gt; Authors face administrative burdens in declaring COIs; standardized declarations&lt;ref name=report_NAC_2009/&gt; or a registry could reduce these.&lt;ref name=registries_RIPR_2016/&gt;

==== Ghost authors and non-contributing authors ====
[[ghostwriter|Ghost authorship]], where a writer contributes but is not credited, has been estimated to affect a significant proportion of the research literature. Honorary authorship, where an author is credited but did not contribute, is more common.&lt;ref name=authorship_IJN_2015/&gt; Appearing as an author on many papers is good for an academic's career. Failure to adhere to authorship standards is rarely punished.&lt;ref name=authorship_IJN_2015/&gt; To avoid misreported authorship, requiring that all authors described the contribution they made to the study ("movie-style credits") has been advocated.&lt;ref name=movie_BMJ_2012/&gt;

The ICMJE criteria for authorship require that authors contribute.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
* Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND
* Final approval of the version to be published; AND
* Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:: — ICMJE&lt;ref name=ICMJE_authorship/&gt;

The ICMJE requires that "All those designated as authors should meet all four criteria for authorship, and all who meet the four criteria should be identified as authors. Those who do not meet all four criteria should be acknowledged".&lt;ref name=ICMJE_authorship/&gt; Academics who have had publication ethics training and those who are aware of the ICMJE authorship criteria are more stringent in their concepts of authorship, and more likely to consider breaches of authorship as misconduct, as are more junior researchers. Awareness is low; one study found that only about half of researchers had read the ICJME criteria.&lt;ref name=authorship_IJN_2015/&gt;

Ghostwriters may be legally liable for fraud.&lt;ref name=fraud_PLOS_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=courts_PLOS_2012/&gt;

=== COIs of study sponsors ===
If a study requires outside funding, this can be a major source of conflicting interests; for instance, if the manufacturer of a drug is funding a study into its safety and efficacy,&lt;ref name=COImedJ_PLOS_2010/&gt; or the sponsor hopes to use the research to defend itself in litigation.&lt;ref name=lawsuits_RetractionWatch_2012/&gt; Sponsors of a study may involve themselves in the design, execution, analysis, and write-up of a study. In extreme cases, they may carry out the research and ghostwrite the article with almost no involvement from the nominal author.&lt;ref name=courts_PLOS_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=fraud_PLOS_2011/&gt; Movie-style credits are advocated as a way to avoid this.&lt;ref name=movie_BMJ_2012/&gt; 

There are many opportunities for bias in trial design as well as trial reporting. For instance, a trial that compares a drug against the wrong dose of a competing drug, may produce spuriously positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020138| pmid=15916457| pmc=1140949|title = Medical Journals Are an Extension of the Marketing Arm of Pharmaceutical Companies| journal=PLOS Medicine| volume=2| issue=5| pages=e138|year = 2005|last1 = Smith|first1 = Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a contract with a sponsor may mean that those named as investigators and authors on the papers may not have access to the trial data, or control over the publication text, or the freedom to talk about their work.&lt;ref name=gag_NEJM_2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=sponsor_NEJM_2001/&gt; While authors and institutions have an interest in avoiding such contracts, it conflicts with their interest in competing for funding from potential study sponsors.&lt;ref name=contracts_NYT_2004/&gt; Institutions which set stricter ethical standards for sponsor contracts lose contracts, and funding, when sponsors go elsewhere.&lt;ref name=gag_NEJM_2005/&gt;

Sponsors have required contractual promises that the study not be reported without the sponsor's approval (gag clauses),&lt;ref name=gag_NEJM_2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=gag_BMJ_2004/&gt; and sued authors over compliance.&lt;ref name=standard_NEJM_2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=gag_BMJ_2004/&gt; Trials may go unpublished to keep commercial information secret, or because the trial results were unfavourable.&lt;ref name=nonpublication_BMJ_2013/&gt; Some journals require that human trials be [[clinical trials registry|pre-registered]] in order to be considered for publication;&lt;ref name=nonpublication_BMJ_2013/&gt; some require that any gag clause be declared as a conflict of interest;&lt;ref name=ICMJE_recommendations_2015/&gt;{{rp|4}} since 2001, some also require a statement that the authors have not agreed to a gag clause.&lt;ref name=gag_NEJM_2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=sponsor_NEJM_2001/&gt; Some journals require a promise to provide access to the original data to researchers intending to [[Replication (scientific method)|replicate the work]].&lt;ref name=seal_NYT_2013/&gt; Some research ethics boards,&lt;ref name=pub_bias/&gt; universities,&lt;ref name=gag_BMJ_2004/&gt; and national laws&lt;ref name=FDAungag_BMJ_2008/&gt; prohibit gag clauses. Gag clauses may not be legally enforceable if compliance would cause sufficient public harm.&lt;ref name=gag_BMJ_2004/&gt; Non-publication has been found to be more common in industry-funded trials, contributing to [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name=pub_bias/&gt;

It has been suggested that having many different sponsors with different interests protects against COI-induced bias. As of 2006, there was no evidence for or against this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=wouldsaythat_JRSM_2006/&gt;

==Effect on conclusions of research==
There is evidence that industry funding of studies of medical devices and drugs results in these studies having more positive conclusions regarding efficacy ([[funding bias]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lundh |first=Andreas |last2=Lexchin |first2=Joel |last3=Mintzes |first3=Barbara |last4=Schroll |first4=Jeppe B. |last5=Bero |first5=Lisa |date=2017-02-16 |title=Industry sponsorship and research outcome |language=en |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd |doi=10.1002/14651858.mr000033.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar relationship has been found in clinical trials of surgical interventions, where industry funding leads to researchers exaggerating the positive nature of their findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Probst |first=Pascal |last2=Knebel |first2=Phillip |last3=Grummich |first3=Kathrin |last4=Tenckhoff |first4=Solveig |last5=Ulrich |first5=Alexis |last6=Büchler |first6=Markus W. |last7=Diener |first7=Markus K. |date=July 2016 |title=Industry Bias in Randomized Controlled Trials in General and Abdominal Surgery |url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00000658-201607000-00015 |journal=Annals of Surgery |volume=264 |issue=1 |pages=87–92 |doi=10.1097/sla.0000000000001372 |issn=0003-4932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all studies have found a statistically significant relationship between industry funding and study outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chartres |first=Nicholas |last2=Fabbri |first2=Alice |last3=Bero |first3=Lisa A. |date=2016-12-01 |title=Association of Industry Sponsorship With Outcomes of Nutrition Studies |url=http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.6721 |journal=JAMA Internal Medicine |language=en |volume=176 |issue=12 |pages=1769 |doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.6721 |issn=2168-6106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Voineskos |first=Sophocles H. |last2=Coroneos |first2=Christopher J. |last3=Ziolkowski |first3=Natalia I. |last4=Kaur |first4=Manraj N. |last5=Banfield |first5=Laura |last6=Meade |first6=Maureen O. |last7=Chung |first7=Kevin C. |last8=Thoma |first8=Achilleas |last9=Bhandari |first9=Mohit |date=February 2016 |title=A Systematic Review of Surgical Randomized Controlled Trials |url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00006534-201602000-00061 |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=453e–461e |doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000475767.61031.d1 |issn=0032-1052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interests of research participants ==
Chronically ill medical research participants report expecting to be told about COIs, and some report that they would not participate if the researcher had some sorts of COIs.&lt;ref name=wouldsaythat_JRSM_2006/&gt; Multiple ethical guidelines forbid researchers with a financial interest in the outcome from being involved in human trials, with few exceptions.&lt;ref name=report_NAC_2009/&gt;

The consent agreements entered into with study participants may be legally binding on the academics, but not on the sponsor, unless the sponsor has a contractual commitment saying otherwise.&lt;ref name=compact_NEJM_2007/&gt;

Ethical rules, including the [[Declaration of Helsinki]], require that the results of human trials be published,&lt;ref name=nonpublication_BMJ_2013/&gt; and human trial participants are often motivated by a desire to improve medical knowledge.&lt;ref name=trials_FDA_2014/&gt; Patients may also be harmed if safety data, such risks to patients, are kept secret.&lt;ref name=sponsor_NEJM_2001/&gt; Duties to human-research participants, therefore, can conflict with interests in nonpublication&lt;ref name=sponsor_NEJM_2001/&gt; (such as gag clauses, detailed above&lt;ref name=gag_NEJM_2005/&gt;).

== Publication of COI declarations ==
Some journals place COI declarations at the beginning of an article, but most put it at the end in smaller print.&lt;ref name=wouldsaythat_JRSM_2006/&gt; Positioning makes a difference; if a reader feels that they are being manipulated from the beginning of a text, they read more critically than if the same feeling is produced at the end of a text.&lt;ref name=reactance_2EJSP_2006/&gt;

The ICMJE says only that "each journal should develop standards with regard to the form the [COI] information should take and where it will be posted".&lt;ref name=ICMJE_recommendations_2015/&gt; It is often placed after the body of the article, just before the reference section.&lt;ref name=pubmed_Vox_2017/&gt; Some COI statements, like the COI statements of anonymous reviewers, may not be published at all. {{See above|COIs of peer reviewers}} COI statements are sometimes [[paywall]]ed, so that they are only visible to those who have paid for full text access.&lt;ref name=rivalry_RetractionWatch_2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=pubmed_Blumenthal_2016/&gt;

In 2017 [[PubMed]] began including COI statements at the end of the abstract, before the body of the article,&lt;ref name=pubmed_Vox_2017/&gt; after complaints that, as COI declarations were only included in full article texts, they often went unseen for [[paywall]]ed articles.&lt;ref name=pubmed_Blumenthal_2016/&gt; Only COI statements that are appropriately formatted and tagged by the publisher themselves are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Robertson |first1=Christopher |title=Conflict of Interests Disclosures Come to PubMed|url=http://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2017/04/20/conflict-of-interests-disclosures-come-to-pubmed/ |website=Bill of Health |publisher=Petrie-Flom Center, Harvard Law School |date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Science journalism]] rarely reports COI information from the academic article reported upon (in some studies, fewer than 1% of stories reported COI information).&lt;ref name=registries_RIPR_2016/&gt;

== False statements of COIs ==
Failing to disclose a conflict of interest may, depending on the circumstances, be considered a form of [[corruption]]&lt;ref name=ICAC/&gt; or [[academic misconduct]].&lt;ref name=nature_Koocher_2010/&gt;

The '''Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange''' ('''CBYX''', German name: ''Parlamentarisches Patenschafts-Programm'' or ''PPP'') is a youth [[student exchange program]] founded in 1983.  The program, which is jointly sponsored by the [[United States Congress]] and the [[Bundestag|German Bundestag]], funds exchange programs for German and American students through grants to private exchange organizations in both countries. The funding in the United States is administered by the [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] of the [[United States Department of State]]

The program was established to celebrate the 300th anniversary of German settlement in North America and has been renewed by both legislative bodies since its inception.  Over 23,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usagermanyscholarship.org/news-and-events/article/?article_id=9689}}&lt;/ref&gt; German and American students have completed their exchange through the program, which provides a full exchange year complete with orientation and language programs and travel opportunities within Germany and the United States. The exchange year culminates in a conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] in which German and American students reflect on their exchange year and share their experiences.

The scholarship program is merit-based and is funded based on congressional district for Americans and [[States of Germany|Bundesland]] for Germans. It consists of a High School program (currently administered by six organizations in the United States: AFS, ASSE, AYUSA, CIEE, FLAG, and YFU), a Young Professionals program (administered exclusively by Cultural Vistas) and a Vocational Student program (administered by [[Nacel Open Door]]).

== High School program ==
The largest portion of the scholarship program has been the high school scholarships. Originally the program was only open to high school sophomores and juniors, who would spend their scholarship year in Germany, during what would be their junior or senior year in high school. Currently the program makes 250-280 (the number fluctuates, depending on funding) national scholarships available to any high school student between the ages of 15-18, with a 3.0 or higher [[Grading in the United States#Grade point average|GPA]] on a 4.0 scale, and who is a U.S. citizen, national, or permanent resident. Applications are due in December of the year prior to the scholarship year. After receipt of a full application, select students will be offered an interview, conducted by selection committees in various locations in the United States. These selection committees then put forward the names of the best candidates to receive the scholarships, which are usually approved by the administering organizations.

The following organizations administer the high school program by region:
* [[AFS Intercultural Programs]] (AFS) - Northeastern United States 
* American Scandinavian Student Exchange (ASSE) - Northwestern United States, Alaska and Hawaii 
* Foreign Links Around the Globe (FLAG) - Southwestern United States 
* [[CIEE|Council on International Educational Exchange]] (CIEE)  - Southeastern United States 
* [[Youth For Understanding]] (YFU USA)- Midwestern United States

Each program in the United States has a sister program in Germany, the main counterpart being [[:de:Partnership International|Partnership International e.V.]] Through CBYX's first decade and a half, [[Youth For Understanding]] (YFU) had been the primary administrative organization for the program. YFU's organization administration of the CBYX program ended after the dissolution of the [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA) in late 1999. The USIA had overseen the program on behalf of the U.S. Federal Government. In 2008, YFU again became a primary administrative organization for the grant.

American students who receive the scholarship usually spend 11 months in Germany. The first few weeks of the program are taken up by an Orientation and Language Seminar. The remaining ten months of the program usually see the students spread out over Germany, staying with a host family. They attend a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], the German equivalent of high school, for an academic year. Other seminars take place over the course of the year, including a trip to the capital in [[Berlin]], where the scholars speak, in German, to the German [[Bundestag]].

The admission rate in Germany to this Program is very low, since the Program is seen as the most prestigious scholarships that High School Students can earn. In recent years, the admission rate to the program was less than two percent. The scholarship is earned in competition process.

== Young Professionals Exchange Program ==
This scholarship exchange is dedicated to young professionals between the ages of 18 and 24 who have clear career goals and some relevant work experience in their career field, as well as an openness to cultural exchange. Currently 75 young Germans and 75 young Americans participate in the exchange, living in all 16 German Bundesländer and 39 US states. The program is designed primarily for young Americans in business, technical, engineering, agricultural and vocational fields, while German participants have all completed an Ausbildung (practical training) in their field. [[Cultural Vistas]] administers the program in the United States and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Beziehungen(GIZ) GmbH administers the program in Germany.

American applicants for the Young Professionals portion must be between the ages of 18 and 24 at the start of the program, must be US citizens or permanent residents, must have work and academic experience in their field, must have a strong sense of American identity and interest in German and international affairs, and must show flexibility and diplomacy. German language skills are not required to participate. Applications are due December 1 of each year, and can be completed online at [http://www.culturalvistas.org/cbyx www.culturalvistas.org/cbyx].  After the initial application round, candidates are interviewed at various locations across the U.S. by a team of [[Cultural Vistas]] staff, CBYX alumni, host families, German professors, and other program-supporters.

After applying for the program, 150 potential candidates are selected to interview in their state of residence; Seventy-five candidates are then selected to participate in the program, which includes: 
*placement with a German host, or, if no host family can be found, students are placed in a WG (shared apartment) or Studentenwohnheim (student dorm).
*two months of intensive German language training (depending on each participant's language level)
*a semester at a German university, college [Hochschule], or college of applied sciences [Fachhochschule]
*a five-month internship in the participant's career field
*international airfare, partial living stipends, various seminar expenses, and partial travel expenses

German applicants for the Young Professionals portion must be between the ages of 18 and 23 at the start of the program. Candidates must be in a practical training track and must complete their training (Ausbildung) before the program start date. English skills are required for program participation. Applications are due in September of each year. After an interview with InWent and taking a Test of English as a Foreign Language ([[TOEFL]]), candidates meet with their elected district representatives (Abgeordneten) for final selection. One hundred candidates are then selected for the program.

The program starts in the summer for both American and German participants. Americans begin with a two-month language school phase, with the 75 participants divided up into three groups and sent to three different cities usually being Cologne, Saarbrücken or Radolfzell am Bodensee. This two-month phase is followed by a semester at a German university or professional school (Fachhochschule). Some participants may also complete training in the dual-track system (Berufschule). The third phase of the year is a five-month internship with a German company or organization. During the year most participants live with host families, but some stay in shared apartments or dormitories. American participants attend an orientation seminar in Washington, DC, a midyear seminar in Frankfurt, a final seminar in Berlin, and an evaluation seminar in New York.

Before the German participants arrive in the U.S., their program begins with a week-long preparation seminar in Germany in April. After a four-day orientation seminar in New York City, participants travel to their final placements having short-term home stays along the way. Participants study for one semester at a community or technical college or university in some cases and complete the work phase from January to June. During the year participants live with host families and in some cases dormitories. German participants attend a preparation seminar in Germany, an orientation seminar in New York, a final seminar in Washington, DC, and a wrap-up seminar in Germany in the fall after the program.

== Young Vocationalists Exchange Program ==
This scholarship program sends graduating American high school seniors aged 18–19 (some with a vocational specializations and some from regular high schools) to Germany for two months of intensive language training followed by ten months of practical training and schooling in their field of interest. The first two months are spent with the group in Bonn, Germany, where the students live with host families and attend a German language school and cultural excursions. The following ten months are spent apart from the exchange group, where students live with host families in various cities or regions of Germany preassigned by the program. Depending on language proficiency and professional fields of interest, the students attend some sort of school (normal high school or other) for up to five months. By February, all the students start internships in their particular field of interest. The students may find their own internships, or can ask for help from their host families and/or area representatives. These selections are based on the location of various area representatives and the availability of specific fields of internships in those locations. Students also participate in two seminars held in Berlin: a mid-term seminar (with fellow vocational program students) and a re-entry seminar (with all fellow CBYX program participants). Prior German language skills are not required. Nacel Open Door recruits and selects participants for this exchange and administers the program.

'''Education in Guyana''' is provided largely by the [[government of Guyana]], through the Ministry of Education and its arms in the ten different regions of the country. Guyana's education system is a legacy from its time as [[British Guiana]], and is similar to that of the other [[English language|anglophone]] member states of the [[Caribbean Community]], which are affiliated to the [[Caribbean Examinations Council]] (CXC). School curricula, funding, standards and other policies are set by the central government and implemented through the Ministry of Education and related agencies. The Education System is divided into eleven districts, ten of which correspond to the national administrative and geographical regions of the country, while the capital, [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], is treated as a separate education district.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO National Report on Higher Education (Guyana), http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001315/131595e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; With 8.3% of its [[GDP]] spent on education, Guyana sits with Cuba, Iceland, Denmark and Botswana as among the few countries with top spending on education.&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook - Education Expenditures, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2206.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutory age for beginning compulsory education is five years nine months, and students are required to attend school until age 16. However, children who do not meet the statutory age to begin school are sometimes enrolled early or generally attend some kind of [[pre-school]]. To meet the requirements for compulsory education students generally attend public schools, but there are a few private schools which offer education at one or all stages of learning; [[home-schooling]] is virtually non-existent in Guyana. The [[academic year]] usually begins in September and ends in July of the following year and with the exception of [[President's College (Guyana)|President's College]] students have a five-hour school day.

Outside of the private sector, [[free education]] from nursery to university was the norm in Guyana until the mid-1990s. The current provision of education is subsidised from nursery through secondary schools, with students now having to pay for tuition at some tertiary institutions. This development reflected a change from the 1970s when Guyana became a socialist-inspired [[Cooperative]] Republic. The country's educational policy in the 1970s was intended to broaden access to education, as before that education beyond primary school was expensive and designed primarily for a small elite. In the 1970s single-sex schools were made [[co-educational]]; private and parochial schools were incorporated into the public system.&lt;ref&gt;Education Watch-Advancement of Education in Guyana:A Case Study, http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2003/issue3/0303p47.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The reform which occurred was part of a wider phenomenon in a post-colonial [[CARICOM]] aiming to provide an education that reflected
the full heritage and aspirations of independent states. Today, as part of its obligations to the CXC, Guyana's educational specifications and
assessment procedures are bound by regional guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Caribbean Examinations Council Policy Document, http://www.cxc.org/section.asp?Sec=3&amp;SSec=10&amp;Info=79&lt;/ref&gt; Students wear uniforms to school.

Guyana has a reading [[literacy rate]] at 92% of the population over age 15.&lt;ref&gt;Guyana Bureau of Statistics - Education and Training, http://www.statisticsguyana.gov.gy/pubs/Chapter5_Education_Training.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this high level of reading literacy, significant portions of the Guyanese population
have functional literacy difficulties resulting in a lack of employability and other socio-economic disadvantages; this has caused government and charitable agencies to push education as a tool in poverty reduction.

Guyana is one of the highest ranked developing countries in the [[Education Index]] of the [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Report]].
With a score of 0.943 on the Education Index, its overall rank is 37, but ranks third in the Caribbean after Cuba and Barbados, and second in South America after Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;UNDP Human Development Report, Education Index, 2007/2008, http://hdrstats.undp.org/indicators/7.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[DFID]], Guyana has achieved the [[Millennium Development Goal]] of [[universal primary education]] but continues to struggle with the provision of increased access to satisfactory secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;DFID Case study-Improving access to Guyana's secondary schools, http://www.dfid.gov.uk/casestudies/files/south-america/guyana-education.asp&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the poorest countries in the [[Western Hemisphere]], instruction in Guyana's schools makes little or no use of instructional technologies such as [[interactive whiteboards]] or other multimedia tools. Indeed, many schools are short on basic resources, especially in the areas of science and technology, and this sometimes puts students at a disadvantage when compared to their counterparts in the region.

As part of a continuous effort to tackle inequalities and inefficiencies in the system, the [[parliament of Guyana]] has been debating and redrafting the 2007 Education bill. The bill moves Guyana closer to a [[comprehensive education]] system, but retains the use of [[corporal punishment]] as a disciplinary measure, despite Guyana's obligations to international conventions such as the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child|UN Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;Help and Shelter: Submissions on the Draft Education Bill, http://www.sdnp.org.gy/hands/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nursery school==

Nursery education in Guyana is not compulsory, though most children attend them. Nursery or kindergarten schools, sometimes referred to
as play schools are provided by the government as well as private entities. It is essentially a formalised extension of [[early childhood education]] and is available to children who are age 3 years 9 months at the end of the first term of the school year.&lt;ref name="ndsguyana.org"&gt;Guyana National Development Strategy, Chapter 18, http://www.ndsguyana.org/document.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The education section of Guyana's National Development Strategy (NDS), chapter 18, further indicates that the nursery education programme is a two-year programme which focuses on child development.

The introduction of a national nursery education programme occurred in 1976 as part of larger education reforms in the country. The programme is delivered in specially designed nursery schools or in [[primary schools]]. Some nursery schools function as feeder programmes for primary schools which are seen as high achievers - gaining entrance into those schools inevitably becomes competitive and sometimes exclusive.

Nursery schools in Guyana since the 1980s have faced serious challenges such as adequate numbers of trained teachers as well as adequate facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Taharally, L. (1983) Early Childhood Education in Guyana, http://www.springerlink.com/content/f38vk1j27lx6r102/fulltext.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, as early childhood education takes on a higher level of importance in development and poverty eradication, efforts are afoot to address those challenges. [[UNICEF]] is one body that is involved in addressing nursery education challenges as it is a major funder of initiatives which further childhood development in Guyana and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Education for All Assessment - Guyana Country Report, http://www.unesco.org/education/wef/countryreports/guyana/rapport_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:School in Georgetown.jpg|thumb|A primary school in Georgetown, Guyana.]]

==Primary school==

Primary education is compulsory and requires attendance for six years. Over the last five years education in Guyana has been undergoing continuous reform. The six-year programme is no longer organised as "Preparatory A and B, and Standards 1 to 4" - it is now Grades 1 to 6. Part of this reform has meant that the Secondary School Entrance Education (SSEE) [[Eleven-plus|11+]] or common entrance exam is no longer used to award places in secondary schools, instead primary school students now take the Grade Six (Level 6) assessment to gain a secondary school place.&lt;ref name="stabroeknews.com"&gt;Stabroek News editorial, Grade Six Assessment, http://www.stabroeknews.com/2007/news/local/03/04/grade-six-assessment/&lt;/ref&gt; One of the objectives of this reform is to tackle the problem of overcrowding at oversubscribed schools.

There are essentially three types of primary schools: the first and most common one is the primary school which provides a typical primary education -  from Grades 1 to 6, then there is the primary school which has a primary and a secondary department, and the primary school which has a nursery and secondary department.

The curriculum of primary schools in Guyana is designed to impart basic literacy and numeracy skills, and also aims to prepare students for secondary education. This literacy and numeracy training is complemented with lessons in [[Social Studies]] and Integrated Science. Though Guyana is considered to have met its [[Millennium Development Goal]] for universal primary education, the challenge for primary education remains equity of access in terms of curriculum delivery, quality and relevance.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Guyana website, http://www.unicef.org/guyana/children_5031.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Equity of access is a problem largely as a result of how the primary education system is structured, as well as uneven resource availability based on geography - that is, schools on Guyana's coasts and in urban areas tend to be better resourced than schools in the hinterland or in rural areas.

[[File:Georgetown street.jpg|thumb|[[St. Stanislaus College (Guyana)|St. Stanislaus College]] and St. Stephen's Primary school students in Georgetown.]]

==Secondary school==

Secondary schooling in Guyana is tiered. There are senior secondary schools, which tend to be more academic in orientation, junior secondary schools, Community High Schools and Secondary Departments of Primary Schools. Since the current reforms are phased, students who perform well in their primary school assessments are awarded places at top schools such as [[Bishops' High School, Guyana|Bishops' High School]], [[St. Stanislaus College (Guyana)|St. Stanislaus College]],St.Joseph High School, St. Rose's High School, [[President's College (Guyana)|President's College]] and [[Queen's College, Guyana|Queen's College]] rather than a school in their geographic catchment area.&lt;ref name="stabroeknews.com"/&gt;

For the most part, the curriculum offered in secondary schools is that of the CXC geared towards preparing students to leave secondary school with subject passes at the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) or the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE). CSEC is equivalent to the UK's [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) and CAPE to [[A-levels]].  The senior and junior secondary schools prepare students for the CSEC and CAPE qualifications, but the Community High Schools and secondary departments prepare students for the Secondary Schools Proficiency Examination (SSPE); students who do well on this exam may transfer to senior or junior secondary schools. Students attending senior or junior secondary schools attend from [[Grade 7]] to [[Grade 11]] for CSEC and move on to [[Grade 12]] if interested in the CAPE qualification. Community High and students in secondary departments of primary schools, attend from [[Grade 7]] to  [[Grade 10]]. GCSE and A-level examinations are still offered in some schools but they are expected to be phased out as part of the educational reforms system.

Since the 1990s Guyana has seen the return of faith schools, primarily in the secondary sector. There is one International School - the Georgetown International School.&lt;ref&gt;Georgetown International School, http://www.isbi.com/istd-viewschool/4030-Georgetown_International_School.html&lt;/ref&gt; The other private schools recognised by the Ministry of Education are: ISA Islamic School ([[Muslim]])[http://www.gitgy.com/isa.html], Mae's School, The New Guyana School, The School of the Nations ([[Bahai]])[http://www.schoolnations-gy.com/] and Marian's Academy ([[Roman Catholic]])[https://web.archive.org/web/20120828143639/http://www.marianacademy.edu.gy/]. These private schools have become highly desirable as they are seen to offer a better quality of education compared to public schools.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Data on Education, http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/archive/Countries/WDE/2006/LATIN_AMERICA_and_the_CARIBBEAN/Guyana/Guyana.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, students are considered to have had a good secondary education after obtaining a minimum of five CSEC subjects at the CXC; depending on their career interests, students may spend a further two years in secondary school for [[Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination|CAPE]] offerings or proceed directly to further or higher education courses. Though the CSEC subjects are normally taken in Grade Eleven and the CAPE subjects in Grades Twelve and Thirteen, students may take them earlier if so prepared. Students are required to take a [[foreign language]] in some schools, but outside of core subjects, the curriculum generally allows students to focus on their interests. The [[International Baccalaureate]] IB programme is not available in Guyana, but parents and students interested in the [[Advanced Placement]] AP programme can pursue it at the Georgetown International School.[http://www.isbi.com/istd-viewschool/4030-Georgetown_International_School.html]

[[Anna Regina Multilateral]] school and [[President's College (Guyana)|President's College]] are Guyana's only boarding schools; both of them are co-educational public schools.

==Special schools==

Students with disabilities or special needs are educated in schools specially designed for them. They follow the national curriculum,
but this is supplemented or adapted where required. As in some places, there is still a stigma associated with attending a special school,
as a result some parents avoid enrolling their children. Apart from that, there isn't a society-wide  consciousness or campaign for improving facilities for disabled students. Some schools are partnered with mainstream schools as in the case of President's College and the David Rose School;
in this partnership President's College students raise funds and provide other forms of support for the students of the David Rose School. Some special schools cater for the emotionally and socially deprived as well as students who have disabilities such as visual or auditory impairment.

==Vocational school/Technical school==

There are about ten technical/vocational schools across the country which are post-secondary in nature. Among the more prominent technical/vocational schools are the Government Technical Institute (GTI), Guyana Industrial Training Centre (GTIC), Carnegie School of Home Economics, Guyana School of Agriculture (GSA), New Amsterdam Technical Institute (NATI) and the Linden Technical Institute. Private entities such as the Guyana Sugar Corporation and the Private Aircraft Owners Association also provide technical education.&lt;ref name="ndsguyana.org"/&gt;

==Further Education/Higher Education==
This sector includes teacher training colleges, advanced technical schools and the university.

==College==

The [[Cyril Potter College of Education]] (CPCE), the Schools of Nursing (Georgetown, New Amsterdam), Critchlow Labour College and Kuru Kuru Cooperative College are the principal colleges in Guyana.

'''CPCE'''

[[Cyril Potter College of Education]] (CPCE) was established by law in the 19th Century to train primary school teachers; today, its main campus is at Turkeyen, Greater Georgetown with centres at New Amsterdam and Linden, Rose Hall, Anna Regina, Vreed-en-Hoop and provides two and three-year programmes for nursery, primary and secondary teachers, the programmes are in-service and pre-service.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Potter College of Education website, http://www.sdnp.org.gy/cpce/Department%20Pages/About%20CPCE.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schools of Nursing''' (Georgetown, New Amsterdam)

These institutions provide basic training for [[nursing assistants]], professional nurses, as well as [[midwifery]].

'''Critchlow Labour College'''

The Critchlow Labour College was established in 1967as the educational arm of the trade Union Movement. It provides pre-university courses in Industrial Relations, business, sociology and a [[CXC]] programme for school leavers who need to obtain those qualifications. It has plans to introduce
[[associate degrees]] but has postponed that initiative because of funding problems.&lt;ref&gt;Stabroek News article on Funding at Critchlow Labour College, http://www.stabroeknews.com/2008/news/local/03/01/no-provision-made-for-critchlow-labour-college-in-2008-budget/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuru Kuru Cooperative College'''

Kuru Kuru Cooperative College is accredited by the University of Guyana and the Association of Caribbean Tertiary Institutions. This institution lists
its main aim as that of providing training on all aspects of cooperative business.&lt;ref&gt;Kuru Kuru College website, http://www.kurukuru.edu.gy/index1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music Studies'''

Guyana is home to many unique music traditions, but despite its importance for cultural heritage, music has tended to receive minimal support in schools. Music studies are offered as part of teacher training at CPCE, and a fledgling National School of Music was opened in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Rohan Sagar and David G. Hebert, [http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/SagarHebert14_2.pdf “Research-Based Curriculum Design for Multicultural School Music: Reflections on a National Project in Guyana,”] Action, Criticism, and Theory for Music Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Other Colleges'''

Apart from these state-owned institutions there are private institutions such as [[The International University-Guyana]] which offer training in accountancy, business and computing among other fields.
&lt;ref&gt;Guyana National Development Strategy, http://www.ndsguyana.org/document.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==University==

The [[University of Guyana]] in Guyana is the major university that operates on two campuses, Tain ([[Berbice]]) and Turkeyen ([[Demerara]]). It was established in 1963 after Guyana expressed its preference for a local university given the costs associated with Guyanese students attending the University of the West Indies ([[UWI]]) and other universities.

It provides a professional education in many areas, but students who want to pursue training in fields such as anthropology, astronomy or librarianship must travel abroad or pursue distance studies. Students who cannot afford university tuition fees may take a student loan from the state-run student loans agency.&lt;ref&gt;University of Guyana - History webpage, http://www.uog.edu.gy/history&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Guyana like the University of the West Indies is an associate member of [[CARICOM]], it is also a member of the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]].

Texila American University (TAU) one of the best Caribbean Medical school is located in Guyana, the only English-speaking country in South America. TAU offers Health Science programs with a high level of professionalism, exactness and problem solving skills, upon which the foundations of specialist training and an independent medical practice can be built, which facilitates further education and development of their knowledge throughout their life.

==Continuing/Adult education==

The Adult Education Association and, the Institute of Adult and Continuing Education (IDCE), the extramural arm of the [[University of Guyana]] fulfil this role along with many other private and government post-secondary institutions. At the moment the government of Guyana is administering a National Fast Track Literacy programme which aims to improve the literacy skills of young people and adults who did not complete formal education.&lt;ref&gt;Guyana Chronicle article, Include civic education, social graces in literacy programme, http://www.guyanachronicleonline.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=923:include-civic-education,-social-graces-in-literacy-programme&amp;catid=2:news&amp;Itemid=3&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ems Ukaz''', or ''Ems Ukase'' ({{lang-ru|Эмский указ}}, ''Emskiy ukaz''; {{lang-uk|Емський указ}}, ''Ems’kyy ukaz''), was a secret decree (''[[ukaz]]'') of [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia]] issued in 1876, banning the use of the [[Ukrainian language]] in print, with the exception of reprinting of old documents. The ukaz also forbade the import of Ukrainian publications and the staging of plays or lectures in Ukrainian. It was named after the city of [[Bad Ems]], [[Germany]], where it was promulgated.

== Background ==

In the 1860s, a decade and a half after the Imperial Russian government had broken up the [[Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius]] in [[Kiev]] (March 1847), and exiled or arrested its founder [[Nikolay Kostomarov]] and other prominent figures, Ukrainian intellectuals were gaining further awareness of their cultural background.  ''[[Hromada]]'' cultural associations (named after the traditional village assembly) started in a number of cities, and Sunday schools started in the cities and towns (the Russian Imperial administration had neglected education).  The new cultural movement was partly driven by publications in both Russian and Ukrainian, including journals (such as Kostomarov's ''Osnova'', 1861–62, and [[Leonid Hlibov|Hlibov]]'s ''Chernyhosvs’kyy Lystok'', 1861–63), historical and folkloristic monographs (Kostomarov's biography of the Cossack hetman [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], [[Panteleimon Kulish|Kulish]]'s two-volume folklore collection ''Zapiski o Yuzhnoy Rusi'', ''Notes on Southern Rus''', 1856–57), and elementary primers (Kulish's ''Hramatka'', 1857, 1861, [[Taras Shevchenko|Shevchenko]]'s ''Bukvar Yuzhnoruskiy'', 1861&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;).  In ''Osnova'', Kostomarov published his influential article "Dve russkiye narodnosti" ("Two Russian Nationalities").

Although Ukrainianism had been considered popular and somewhat chic in Russian cultural circles, a debate began at the time over its relation to the ideology of Russian [[Pan-Slavism]]—epitomized by a quotation of [[Pushkin]]: "will not all the Slavic streams merge into the Russian sea?"—and a rhetoric of criticism emerged. Conservative Russians called the Ukrainian movement a "Polish intrigue", while Polish commentators had been complaining that Ukrainianism had been used as a weapon against Polish culture in [[right-bank Ukraine]].

After the 1861 [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipation of the serfs]] in the [[Russian Empire]], many landowners were unhappy with the loss of their serfs, while peasants were generally displeased with the terms of the emancipation.  In this atmosphere of discontent, increasing reports reached the imperial government that Ukrainian leaders were plotting to separate from Russia. The 1863 [[January Uprising]] in Poland raised tensions around the issue of ethnic separatism in general even further.  Several Ukrainian activists were arrested, Sunday schools and hromadas were closed and their publication activities were suspended.

A new Ukrainian translation by [[Pylyp Morachevskyi]] of parts of the [[New Testament]] was vetted and passed by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]], but rejected by the [[Most Holy Synod|Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox church]], because it was considered politically suspect.&lt;ref name=Zerk_morachev&gt;{{Ru icon}}/{{uk icon}} Volodymyr Kozyrsky, Vasyl Shenderovsky, "The spiritual valour of Pylyp Morachevsky (to the bicentenary anniversary of his birth)", ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli]] (the Mirror Weekly)'', 5–19 August 2006, [http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/ie/show/609/54147/ in Russian]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, [http://www.zn.kiev.ua/ie/show/609/54147/ in Ukrainian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311010339/http://www.zn.kiev.ua/ie/show/609/54147 |date=2007-03-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Interior Minister Count [[Pyotr Valuyev]] issued a decree through an internal document circulated to the censors on 18 July 1863, known as  [[Valuyev's Circular]]. The Circular implemented a policy based on his opinion that "the Ukrainian language never existed, does not exist, and shall never exist".  It banned the publication of secular and religious books (apart from ''[[belles-lettres]]''), on the premise that not only is the content of such publications potentially questionable, but their very existence implied the anti-imperial idea that a Ukrainian nation could exist.

== Ems Ukaz ==

In the 1870s, the Kiev [[Hromada]] and the South-Western Branch of the Imperial [[Russian Geographic Society]] began to publish important works in Kiev, in Russian, about Ukrainian ethnography.  Authors included [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]], [[Volodymyr Antonovych]], [[Ivan Rudchenko]], and [[Pavlo Chubynsky]].  They held an Archaeological Congress in 1874, and published in the Russian-language paper ''Kievskiy telegraf''.

A member of the Geographic Society, [[Mikhail Yuzefovich]], sent two letters to [[St Petersburg]] warning of separatist activity.  [[Tsar Alexander II]] appointed an Imperial Commission on Ukrainophile Propaganda in the Southern Provinces of Russia, which found evidence of a danger to the state, and recommended extending the scope of the Valuyev decree.  While enjoying a spa in [[Bad Ems]], Germany, in May 1876, the Tsar signed what would come to be called the "Ems Ukaz", extending the [[publication ban]] to apply to all books and song [[lyrics]] in the "Little Russian dialect", and to prohibit the [[import]]ation of such materials.  Public lectures, plays, and song performances in Ukrainian were forbidden, suspect teachers removed from teaching, and presumably dangerous organizations and newspapers shut down.

The ukaz coincided with other actions against [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukrainian culture]]. Drahomanov and fellow activist [[Mykola Ziber]] were sacked from their posts at Kiev's [[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv|University of St Vladimir]], and emigrated along with other cultural leaders such as [[Fedir Vovk]] and [[Serhiy Podolynsky]].  The situation was exposed by professor Mykhailo Drahomanov at the 1878 Paris International Literary Congress.

In 1881, the new [[Tsar Alexander III]] amended the ukaz.  Ukrainian lyrics and dictionaries would be allowed, but the ''Kulishivka'' [[Ukrainian alphabet]] was still prohibited, and such publications would have to employ Russian orthography (disparagingly called the ''Yaryzhka'' by some Ukrainians, after the Russian letter [[yery]], ы).  Performance of Ukrainian plays and humorous songs could be approved by local authorities, but Ukrainian-only [[theatre]]s and troupes could not be established.

Many illegal performances and publications were delivered through ingenuity and [[bribery]], but Ukrainian cultural development practically ceased.

== Aftermath ==

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]] recommended that the ukaz's restrictions be lifted. Ukrainian-language [[newspaper]]s began publication, ''[[Prosvita]]'' (‘Enlightenment’) educational societies were formed, some university professors lectured in Ukrainian, and the Orthodox bishop of the [[Podolia]] vicariate, Parfeniy Levytsky, allowed the language to be used in services and church schools there.

In 1910, concerned about potential revolutionary activity, Interior Minister [[Pyotr Stolypin]] restored the ukaz's restrictions and shut down the Prosvita societies and Ukrainian-language publications.  Russian-language press and intellectuals launched a campaign against the idea of Ukrainian autonomy or separatism.

Thus, self-aware Ukrainians remained a small intelligentsia in [[Dnieper Ukraine]], out of touch with a much larger rural population who lacked the opportunity for a cultural education.  Russian imperial ideology dominated the schools and the army, and the [[Russian language]] was the only one used for official business in the urban workplace, government offices, and public services.  In the meantime, Ukrainian self-identity would grow in Austro-Hungarian [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], out of reach of Russian imperial authorities.

The ukaz was never cancelled, but became void along with all other imperial Russian laws in the [[February Revolution]] of 1917–18. [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|After the Revolution]], Ukrainian language, education and culture was allowed to flower in the [[Ukrainian National Republic]], the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]], and under the [[Ukrainization#1923-1931: Early years of Soviet Ukraine|Ukrainization]] policies of [[Soviet Ukraine]] before 1931.

== Text of the ukaz ==
Excerpts from the Ukaz:

{{quote|The importation into the Russian Empire, without special permission of the Central Censorship over Printing, of all books and pamphlets in the [[Little Russia]]n dialect, published abroad, is forbidden,

The printing and publishing in the Empire of original works and translations in this dialect is forbidden with the exception of (a) historical documents and monuments; (b) works of [[belles-lettres]] but with the provision that in the documents the orthography of the originals be retained; in works of belles-lettres no deviations from the accepted [[Russian orthography]] are permitted and permission for their printing may be given only by the Central Censorship over Printing.

All theatrical performances and lectures in the Little Russian dialect, as well as printing of text to musical notes, are forbidden.|&lt;ref&gt;''Radians’kyi knyhar'' 1930, quoted in Luckyj 1990, pp 24–25. A full version, with five points addressed "for the Ministry of the Interior", five "for the Ministry of Education", and one "for the Third Section [secret police] of His Majesty's Supreme Chancellory" is published in Magocsi 1996, pp 372–3, translated from Savchenko 1970, p 381.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Florida Student Association, Inc.''' ('''FSA''') was formed in 1976 under the "Florida Not For Profit Corporation Act".&lt;ref&gt;Section [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0600-0699/0617/Sections/0617.01011.html 617.01011] of the Florida Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt; FSA represents the interests of students of the [[State University System of Florida]].  

A [[statute]] enacted by the [[Government of Florida]] has created a "student government" at each state university.  The statute provides that each student government shall have a "student body president".&lt;ref&gt;Section [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=1000-1099/1004/Sections/1004.26.html 1004.26], "University student governments", Florida Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt; FSA's [[board of directors]] includes the student body president of each state university student government.  FSA's board of directors exercises the corporation's powers and manages its affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Section [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0600-0699/0617/Sections/0617.0801.html 617.0801], "Duties of board of directors", Florida Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
FSA coordinates the collective efforts of each of the State University student governments with a goal of providing unified student representation before the [[Government of Florida|Florida Government]]. FSA holds monthly meetings where student leaders can interact with their peers from other institutions.

==Florida Board of Governors==
Section 7 of Article IX of the [[Constitution of the State of Florida]] provides that the state university system of Florida shall be governed by "a [[Florida Board of Governors|board of governors]]".  Section 7 also provides that "the president of the Florida student association" shall be a member of the board of governors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&amp;Submenu=3&amp;Tab=statutes#A9S07 Section 7], Article IX, Constitution of the State of Florida.&lt;/ref&gt; The FSA president serves as a member of the board of governors without compensation but may be reimbursed for travel and per diem expenses to the extent provided by law.&lt;ref&gt;Section [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=1000-1099/1001/Sections/1001.70.html 1001.70(2)] of the Florida Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial Aid Appeals Committee==
An applicant for state student [[Student financial aid in the United States|financial aid]] may appeal the rejection of his or her application. The appeal will be heard by a committee of four members appointed by the [[Florida Commissioner of Education]]. A decision rendered by an appeals committee constitutes "final agency action".&lt;ref&gt;Rule [https://www.flrules.org/gateway/ruleNo.asp?id=6A-20.0371 6A-20.0371], "Right to Appeal Eligibility Determination", [[Florida Administrative Code]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An appeals committee is temporary in nature.  There might be no appeals committees in existence at a particular time or there might be several appeals committees, with each committee being assigned to evaluate one or more appeals.

FSA is authorized by law to nominate students to serve as members of appeals committees.  Each nominee must be enrolled in a public [[postsecondary education|postsecondary institution]] in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Section [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=1000-1099/1009/Sections/1009.42.html 1009.42], "Financial aid appeal process", Florida Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying==
FSA is authorized by law to "Adopt, change, amend, and repeal bylaws, not inconsistent with law or its articles of incorporation, for the administration of the affairs of the corporation and the exercise of its corporate powers".&lt;ref&gt;Section [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0600-0699/0617/Sections/0617.0302.html 617.0302(5)], "Corporate powers", Florida Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt; FSA has adopted a bylaw which provides, in part, that "the activities of the corporation shall include the carrying on of [[lobbying]] efforts and otherwise attempting to influence legislation".&lt;ref&gt;FSA bylaws, Article II, as amended on February 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

FSA was a driving force in the effort to create the "Florida Prepaid College Program".&lt;ref&gt; Section [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=1000-1099/1009/Sections/1009.98.html 1009.98], "[[Stanley G. Tate]] Florida Prepaid College Program", Florida Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, FSA asked key Florida legislators to review the [[State of Michigan]]'s prepaid tuition plan. After reviewing Michigan's plan, [[Florida State Senator]] [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] sponsored a [[Bill (law)|bill]] to establish a similar prepaid tuition plan in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chli.org/news/164595/CHLI-Spotlight-Congresswoman-Ileana-Ros-Lehtinen-the-First-Hispanic-Female-Elected-to-Congress.htm "Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, The First Hispanic Woman Elected to Congress"]. ''CHLI Spotlight''. [[Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute]], March 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; With lobbying efforts by student government presidents and David Corry (FSA Executive Director)&lt;ref&gt;David Corry became the "Executive Director" of FSA on August 2, 1986. [http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1635&amp;context=centralfloridafuture "SG bosses pick new leaders at meeting"]. ''Central Florida Future'', Vol. 18, No. 54, page 1. University of Central Florida, June 18, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and Shari Caprara (FSA Legislative Director),&lt;ref&gt;Shari Caprara became the "Legislative Director" of FSA in August, 1985. [https://archive.org/stream/Florida_Flambeau_1985_Aug/Florida_Flambeau_1985_Aug_djvu.txt ''Florida Flambeau'']. Florida State University, August 19, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Florida House of Representatives]] and the [[Florida Senate]] both passed the bill. The bill was then signed into law by Florida Governor [[Bob Martinez]]. Since that bill became [[Florida law]], more than 1.6 million prepaid college plans have been purchased and nearly 350,000 students have attended college under a prepaid college plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfloridaprepaid.com/who-we-are/our-history/ "Overview"] of prepaid college plans, offered by the  [http://www.myfloridaprepaid.com/who-we-are/about-the-board/ Florida Prepaid College Board].&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the plans were purchased by parents and grandparents when their children/grandchildren were toddlers.

The '''Information Technology Professional Examination Council (ITPEC)''', is an organization that conducts [[information technology]] examinations throughout Asian countries. It was formed to promote information exchange among examination bodies in Asia, and to facilitate such efforts as the development of common examination questions and the administration of the exam on the same date and time. It was established to support international strategies in the spheres of software development and information technology human resources.

It was established in November 2005 by representatives from the countries that have adopted JITEC-IPA's Examination Skill Standards to conduct the Common IP, FE and SW Examinations. These examinations are loosely based on the Japanese [[Information-Technology Engineers Examination]].

The council's members currently include the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Myanmar]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Japan]] and [[Bangladesh]]. These countries agreed to conduct the examination on the same date and time with the same set of questions, so that the examination is consistent among all of the member countries. This consistency enables accurate measurement of the skills of the examinees, as the region shares one set of IT Skill Standards.

==ITPEC Members==

* [[PhilNITS|Philippine National IT Standards Foundation]] ([[PhilNITS]])
* Multimedia Technology Enhancement &amp; Operations Sendirian Berhad (METEOR) - Malaysia
* Myanmar Computer Federation (MCF)
* National IT Park (NITP) - Mongolia
* NSTDA Academy - Thailand
* Vietnam Information Technology Examination and Training Support Center (VITEC)

===ITPEC FE Exam===
The ITPEC Fundamental Information Technology Engineer Examination (ITPEC FE Exam) is loosely based on the Japan Information Technology Fundamental IT Engineers Examination translated in [[American English|English]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Mongolian language|Mongol]], and [[Burmese language|Burmese]]. The scope of the examination covers knowledge and skills required by individuals who have basic knowledge and skills related to general aspects of information technology, including those who compose program design sheets, construct programs, and conduct a series of operations to the extent of unit tests in information systems development projects.

The Information Technology Engineers Examination (ITEE) was first administered in Japan in 1969, and in 1970 it became a national examination under the former Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI, now Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry [METI]). It has grown into one of the largest scale national examinations in Japan and has played an important role in the development of IT engineers.

In October 2000, the "''Asian Common IT Skill Standards Initiative''", proposed by Japan, was adopted at the ASEAN plus Japan, the
People's Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea meeting. In accordance with this initiative, we are working toward the mutual
recognition of skill standards for IT engineers in Asia. This collaboration is expected to help increase cross-border utilization of IT human resources and stimulate business alliances across the region. Since April 2006, the common FE examination has been
conducted twice a year, in the first Sunday of April and third Sunday October at simultaneously starting 1000H [[Japanese Standard Time]].

====Test sections====
The exam is administered for a total of five hours and broken into two parts:
* The '''AM Exam''' is a multiple-choice examination that runs 150 minutes. It is composed of 80 questions, all of which are compulsory and in multiple choice. It generally involves application of the fundamental IT concepts and terms, simple numerical calculations and logical analysis. Total score is 1000 and each question has its own weight depending on its difficulty. 600 points is the passing score.
* The '''PM Exam''' is a multiple-choice examination that runs 150 minutes. It covers knowledge and skills required by individuals who were able to implement [[pseudocode]]s and [[flowchart]]s. It will require skills in debugging and ability to trace the output of a structured program. Total score is 1000 and each question has its own weight depending on its difficulty. 600 points is the passing score.
Each question may have several sub-questions, each answered by multiple choice. The final portion is composed of two 4-question sets. The person must select only one question set depending on their choice of programming language to use (either [[C programming language]] or [[Java programming language]]).

===ITPEC AP Exam===
The ITPEC Applied Information Technology Examination, formerly known as ''Software Design and Development Engineer Examination'', is also loosely based on its Japanese counterpart, the IPA SW Exam, require individuals who have least two years work experience in software development and have the ability to compose internal design and program design sheets, construct effective programs for information systems development projects, and perform a series of processes ranging from unit tests to integrated tests. It is conducted once a year, every first Sunday April in the same venue of the FE Exams.
The exam is administered for a total of five and a half hours and broken into two parts: 
* '''AM Exam''', a multiple-choice examination that lasts 150 minutes, and 
* '''PM Written Exams''': First sub-part runs for 120 minutes and the final sub-part runs for 60 minutes.

'''italki''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|t|ɔː|k|i}} is an online language learning website which connects language learners and teachers through video chat. The site allows students to find online teachers for 1-on-1 tutoring, and teachers to earn money as freelance tutors.&lt;ref&gt;"Online alternatives to language classrooms open up to students," Nik Peachey, The Guardian, https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jul/05/online-english-language-learning-peachey, July 5th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[William G. Bowen]], president of [[Princeton University]] from 1972 to 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Alexander. [http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/bowen_william_gordon.html "Bowen, William Gordon"]. [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; founded JSTOR in 1995. JSTOR originally was conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries, especially [[Research library|research and university libraries]], due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence. Most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals. By digitizing many journal titles, JSTOR allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long-term. Online access and full-text search ability improved access dramatically.

Bowen initially considered using CD-ROMs for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;"JSTOR, A History" by Roger C. Schonfeld, Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Ira Fuchs]], Princeton University's vice-president for Computing and Information Technology, convinced Bowen that CD-ROM was becoming an increasingly outdated technology and that network distribution could eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility. (For example, all Princeton's administrative and academic buildings were networked by 1989; the student dormitory network was completed in 1994; and campus networks like the one at Princeton were, in turn, linked to larger networks such as [[BITNET]] and the [[Internet]].) JSTOR was initiated in 1995 at seven different library sites, and originally encompassed ten economics and history journals. JSTOR access improved based on feedback from its initial sites, and it became a fully searchable index accessible from any ordinary [[web browser]]. Special software was put in place to make pictures and graphs clear and readable.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

With the success of this limited project, Bowen and Kevin Guthrie, then-president of JSTOR, wanted to expand the number of participating journals. They met with representatives of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] and an agreement was made to digitize the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' dating from its beginning in 1665. The work of adding these volumes to JSTOR was completed by December 2000.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;

The [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] funded JSTOR initially. Until January 2009 JSTOR operated as an independent, self-sustaining [[nonprofit organization]] with offices in [[New York City]] and in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]]. Then JSTOR merged with the nonprofit [[Ithaka Harbors, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |title = About
  |url = http://about.jstor.org/about
  |publisher = JSTOR
  |accessdate = 28 November 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 and "dedicated to helping the [[academic community]] take full advantage of rapidly advancing information and networking technologies".&lt;ref name = "About Ithaka" /&gt;

==Content==
JSTOR content is provided by more than 900 publishers.&lt;ref name="Annual Summary"/&gt; The [[bibliographic database|database]] contains more than 1,900 journal titles,&lt;ref name="Annual Summary"/&gt; in more than 50 disciplines. Each object is uniquely identified by an integer value, starting at &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.

In addition to the main site, the JSTOR labs group operates an open service that allows access to the contents of the archives for the purposes of corpus analysis at its ''Data for Research'' service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dfr.jstor.org/ Data for Research]. JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; This site offers a search facility with graphical indication of the article coverage and loose integration into the main JSTOR site. Users may create focused sets of articles and then request a dataset containing word and [[n-gram]] frequencies and basic metadata. They are notified when the dataset is ready and may download it in either [[XML]] or [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] formats. The service does not offer full-text, although academics may request that from JSTOR, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.

JSTOR Plant Science&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.jstor.org/ JSTOR Plant Science]. JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; is available in addition to the main site. JSTOR Plant Science provides access to content such as plant type specimens, taxonomic structures, scientific literature, and related materials and aimed at those researching, teaching, or studying botany, biology, ecology, environmental, and conservation studies. The materials on JSTOR Plant Science are contributed through the Global Plants Initiative (GPI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.jstor.org/content/global-plants#partnerships Global Plants Initiative]. JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; and are accessible only to JSTOR and GPI members. Two partner networks are contributing to this: the African Plants Initiative, which focuses on plants from Africa, and the Latin American Plants Initiative, which contributes plants from Latin America.

JSTOR launched its Books at JSTOR program in November 2012, adding 15,000 current and backlist books to its site. The books are linked with reviews and from citations in journal articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://about.jstor.org/news/new-chapter-begins-books-jstor-launches |title=A new chapter begins: Books at JSTOR launches |date=November 12, 2012 |publisher=JSTOR |accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, JSTOR launched ''JSTOR Daily'', an online magazine meant to bring academic research to a broader audience. Posted articles are generally based on JSTOR entries, and some entries provide the backstory to current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lichterman |first=Joseph |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/10/opening-up-the-archives-jstor-wants-to-tie-a-library-to-the-news/ |title=Opening up the archives: JSTOR wants to tie a library to the news |work=[[Nieman Lab]] |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
JSTOR is licensed mainly to academic institutions, public libraries, research institutions, museums, and schools. More than 7,000 institutions in more than 150 countries have access.&lt;ref name="JSTOR glance" /&gt; JSTOR has been running a pilot program of allowing subscribing institutions to provide access to their alumni, in addition to current students and staff. The Alumni Access Program officially launched in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://about.jstor.org/alumni |title= Access for alumni | publisher =JSTOR | accessdate= December 1, 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual subscriptions also are available to certain journal titles through the journal publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://about.jstor.org/content/individual-subscriptions | title= Individual subscriptions | publisher = JSTOR | accessdate = December 1, 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, JSTOR blocks 150 million attempts by non-subscribers to read articles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/every-year-jstor-turns-away-150-million-attempts-to-read-journal-articles/251382/ Every Year, JSTOR Turns Away 150 Million Attempts to Read Journal Articles]. ''The Atlantic''. Retrieved 29 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inquiries have been made about the possibility of making JSTOR [[open access]]. According to Harvard Law professor [[Lawrence Lessig]], JSTOR had been asked "how much would it cost to make this available to the whole world, how much would we need to pay you? The answer was $250 million".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HAw1i4gOU4#t=44m39 Lessig on "Aaron's Laws—Law and Justice in a Digital Age"]. YouTube (2013-02-20). Retrieved on 2014-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aaron Swartz incident===
{{main|United States v. Aaron Swartz}}
{{see also|Aaron Swartz#JSTOR}}
In late 2010 and early 2011, Internet activist [[Aaron Swartz]] used [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s data network to bulk-download a substantial portion of JSTOR's collection of academic journal articles.&lt;ref name= JSTORstatement /&gt;&lt;ref name= HuffPost/&gt; When the bulk-download was discovered, a video camera was placed in the room to film the mysterious visitor and the relevant computer was left untouched. Once video was captured of the visitor, the download was stopped and Swartz was identified. Rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him, in June 2011 they reached a settlement wherein he surrendered the downloaded data.&lt;ref name=JSTORstatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPost /&gt;

The following month, federal authorities charged Swartz with several "[[data theft]]"–related crimes, including [[wire fraud]], computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a [[Computer security|protected computer]], and recklessly damaging a protected computer.&lt;ref name="Bilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="open-access-adv" /&gt; Prosecutors in the case claimed that Swartz acted with the intention of making the papers available on [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P file-sharing sites]].&lt;ref name=HuffPost /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feds: Harvard fellow hacked millions of papers"/&gt;

Swartz surrendered to authorities, pleaded not guilty to all counts, and was released on $100,000 bail. In September 2012, U.S. attorneys increased the number of charges against Swartz from four to thirteen, with a possible penalty of 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines.&lt;ref name = JusticeGov /&gt;&lt;ref name =Wired/&gt; The case still was pending when Swartz committed [[suicide]] in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21001452 "Aaron Swartz, internet freedom activist, dies aged 26"], [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors dropped the charges after his suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/27/technology/aaron-swartz-father/ "Aaron Swartz's father: He'd be alive today if he was never arrested"], money.cnn.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
The availability of most journals on JSTOR is controlled by a "[[Embargo (academic publishing)|moving wall]]", which is an agreed-upon delay between the current volume of the journal and the latest volume available on JSTOR. This time period is specified by agreement between JSTOR and the publisher of the journal, which usually is three to five years. Publishers may request that the period of a "moving wall" be changed or request discontinuation of coverage. Formerly, publishers also could request that the "moving wall" be changed to a "fixed wall"—a specified date after which JSTOR would not add new volumes to its database. {{As of |2010|11}}, "fixed wall" agreements were still in effect with three publishers of 29 journals made available online through sites controlled by the publishers.&lt;ref name="Wall" /&gt;

In 2010, JSTOR started adding current issues of certain journals through its Current Scholarship Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://about.jstor.org/content/about-current-journals |title=About current journals |publisher=JSTOR |accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasing public access===
Beginning September 6, 2011, JSTOR made public domain content available at no charge to the public.&lt;ref name="JSTOR_EJC_announcement"/&gt;&lt;ref name = LibraryJournal /&gt; This "Early Journal Content" program constitutes about 6% of JSTOR's total content, and includes over 500,000 documents from more than 200 journals that were published before 1923 in the United States, and before 1870 in other countries.&lt;ref name="JSTOR_EJC_announcement"/&gt;&lt;ref name = LibraryJournal /&gt;&lt;ref name=JSTOR_EJC_about/&gt; JSTOR stated that it had been working on making this material free for some time. The Swartz controversy and Greg Maxwell's protest [[torrent file|torrent]] of the same content led JSTOR to "press ahead" with the initiative.&lt;ref name = "JSTOR_EJC_announcement" /&gt;&lt;ref name=LibraryJournal/&gt; {{as of|2017}}, JSTOR does not have plans to extend it to other public domain content, stating that "We do not believe that just because something is in the public domain, it can always be provided for free".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://about.jstor.org/individuals-faq#Do_you_have_plans_to_make_other_content_in_the_public_domain_freely_available|title=About JSTOR: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=JSTOR|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511080512/http://about.jstor.org/individuals-faq#Do_you_have_plans_to_make_other_content_in_the_public_domain_freely_available|archive-date=2017-05-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, JSTOR started a pilot program, "Register &amp; Read", offering limited no-cost access (not [[open access]]) to archived articles for individuals who register for the service. At the conclusion of the pilot, in January 2013, JSTOR expanded Register &amp; Read from an initial 76 publishers to include about 1,200 journals from over 700 publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tilsley|first1=Alexandra|title=Journal Archive Opens Up (Some)|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/01/09/jstor-offer-limited-free-access-content-1200-journals|accessdate=6 January 2015|work=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|date=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registered readers may read up to six articles online every calendar month, but may not print or download PDFs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://support.jstor.org/hc/en-us/articles/360000585347-NEW-MyJSTOR-Read-Online-Free | title =My JSTOR Read Online Free  |publisher=JSTOR |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JSTOR is conducting a [[Wikipedia:JSTOR|pilot program with Wikipedia]], whereby established editors are given reading privileges through the Wikipedia Library, as with a university library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orlowitz|first1=Jake|last2=Earley|first2=Patrick|title=Librarypedia: The Future of Libraries and Wikipedia |url=http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2014/01/discovery/librarypedia-future-libraries-wikipedia/ |department=The Digital Shift|work=[[Library Journal]] |accessdate=20 December 2014 |date=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Price|first1=Gary|title=Wikipedia Library Program Expands With More Accounts from JSTOR, Credo, and Other Database Providers |url=http://www.infodocket.com/2014/06/22/wikipedia-library-programs-expands-with-new-accounts-from-database-providers/ |department=INFOdocket |work=[[Library Journal]] |accessdate=20 December 2014|date=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
In 2012, JSTOR users performed nearly 152 million searches, with more than 113 million article views and 73.5 million article downloads.&lt;ref name="Annual Summary"/&gt; JSTOR has been used as a resource for linguistics research to investigate trends in language use over time and also to analyze gender differences and inequities in scholarly publishing, revealing that in certain fields, men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions and that women are significantly underrepresented as authors of single-authored papers.&lt;ref name="Lexicology"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Robin|title=Scholarly Publishing's Gender Gap|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Hard-Numbers-Behind/135236/|journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=6 January 2015|date=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Jevin D.|last2=Jacquet|first2=Jennifer|last3=King|first3=Molly M.|last4=Correll|first4=Shelley J.|last5=Bergstrom|first5=Carl T.|date=2013-07-22|title=The Role of Gender in Scholarly Authorship|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=8|issue=7|pages=e66212|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066212|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3718784|pmid=23894278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jerusalem Botanical Gardens''' ('''JBG'''), originally planned as successor to the [[National Botanic Garden of Israel]] on [[Mount Scopus]] which, nevertheless, still exists as a separate entity, is located in the neighborhood of [[Nayot]] in [[Jerusalem]], on the southeastern edge of the [[Givat Ram]] campus of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000079509.htm Gemsinisrael.com], The Jerusalem Botanical Gardens.&lt;/ref&gt;
The garden is arranged in phytogeographic sections, featuring flora of various regions around the world. The Jerusalem Botanical Gardens opened to the public in 1985. The tropical conservatory opened in 1986 and the South Africa section was planted in 1989. The Hank Greenspan Entrance Plaza, Dvorsky Visitors’ Center and restaurant were built in 1990.

==History==
Plans for the first [[National Botanic Garden of Israel]], on a plot of land purchased on [[Mount Scopus]] in 1926, were drawn up by [[Alexander Eig]], chairman of the Botany Department of the Hebrew University, based on the flora of the [[Land of Israel]] from Mount Lebanon to the desert. Planting began in 1931. The botanical gardens on Mount Scopus were the first home of the  [[Biblical Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3349288,00.html More than just Mount Scopus - Israel Travel, Ynetnews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1948, in the [[Israeli War of Independence]], access to Mount Scopus and the university campus was cut off from the rest of Israel, and it was decided to create a new Botanical Garden (the subject of this entry) near the [[Jewish National and University Library]], on the new campus of the Hebrew University in Givat Ram in western Jerusalem. The new Botanical Garden, including a unique collection of Coniferae, was opened in 1954, soon after the establishment of Givat Ram campus. In 1962, a rocky hill in the southeastern corner of the campus was planted with [[conifers]] from North America. That year, Michael Avishai was appointed scientific director of the gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victoria-adventure.org/more_than_links_images/michael_avishai/page1.html Michael Avishai, Jerusalem Botanical Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the trees were raised from his private seed collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/plants/8968807/A-journey-through-the-Holy-Land.html A journey through the Holy Land]&lt;/ref&gt;

Budgeting was a serious problem until 1975, when the Society of Friends of the Botanical Gardens was established and the garden became a joint project of the university, the Jerusalem Municipality and the [[Jewish National Fund]]. A scientific board was appointed, and architect [[Shlomo Aronson]] was commissioned to plan the layout. In 1981, the Garden Association was founded, and a board of executives appointed. The garden was opened to the public in 1985. In 1994, it separated from the Hebrew University, and has been managed by the Botanical Garden Association since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botanic.co.il/english/about/history.htm Botanical Gardens-Home Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009144455/http://www.botanic.co.il/english/about/history.htm |date=2007-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bonsai==
The garden's [[Japan]]ese section contains over 150 [[bonsai]] trees, the largest concentrated collection of bonsai trees in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerusalem.com/discover/article_450/Going-Japanese-at-the-Jerusalem-Botanical-Gardens Going Japanese at the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090415012147/http://www.jerusalem.com/discover/article_450/Going-Japanese-at-the-Jerusalem-Botanical-Gardens |date=2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birds==

'''Juan Romagoza Arze''' (born 1960) is a [[Salvadorian]] surgeon, and current director of [[La Clinica del Pueblo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cja.org/what-we-do/litigation/romagoza-arce-v-garcia-and-vides-casanova/clients/|title=Clients - CJA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latino.si.edu/virtualgallery/OJOS/bios/bios_Romagoza.htm|title=Romagoza|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Romagoza was born in Usulutan, El Salvador. In 1973 enrolled to medicine school in University of El Salvador. During his surgeon rotation practice worked in poor and rural areas and was witness of violence and repression by government forces during [[Salvadoran Civil War]] against poor, church workers and medical personal that aid them.

==Kidnapping and torture==
In December 1980, while Romagoza was providing medical care at a church clinic in [[Santa Anita, Chalatenango|Santa Anita]], [[Chalatenango, El Salvador (municipality)|Chalatenango]], two army vehicles arrived to the clinic and opened fire to the people, Romagoza was shot in one foot and kidnapped and jailed at National Guard headquarters in San Salvador for 22 days where he was tortured and interrogated three or four times per day by electric shocks, cigarette burns, sexually assault, water torture, and being hung by his fingers. In one torturer session he was in his left hand in pressence of Vides Casanova. Juan was released in January 1981 due to the detention he lost 80 pounds and lost his ability to perform surgery due to the injuries inflicted and had to be physically carried out by his uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/peace-justice/former-salvadoran-defense-minister-tied-killings-oscar-romero-and-churchwomen|title=Former Salvadoran defense minister, tied to killings of Oscar Romero and churchwomen, deported back to El Salvador|date=13 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
Juan Romagoza fled El Salvador and  moved to Guatemala, Mexico, and lately to the United States on April 1983 was to become an American Citizen in 1986 and was granted political asylum in 1987.

==Career==
Margulies made her feature film debut in [[Steven Seagal]]'s film ''[[Out for Justice]]'' (1991), playing a prostitute. In 1994, Margulies was cast in the pilot episode of the [[NBC]] medical drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' as [[Carol Hathaway]], an emergency care nurse who, despondent over her relationship with pediatrician [[Doug Ross]] ([[George Clooney]]), attempted suicide. Her character was originally intended to die; however, the producers changed the plot and made Carol Hathaway a main cast member. At the same time Margulies had been offered an extended role on NBC's ''[[Homicide: Life on the Streets]]'', after a two-episode appearance earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSmjZJKrgNk| title=The Story Behind "ER"| publisher=Pop network| date=November 13, 2013| access-date=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margulies chose ''ER'' and remained on the show for six seasons until 2000. She won an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress - Drama Series|Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Television Drama]] in 1994, and continued to be nominated for this award every year during her tenure on ''ER''. She was the only series regular cast member to win an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/julianna-margulies|title=Julianna Margulies - Television Academy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Margulies broke her silence on her decision to leave ''ER'' at the height of her career and a $27 million paycheck. She revealed that although everyone said it would be "career suicide" not to return to the medical drama she had starred in for six years, she was never concerned about the consequences.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'm a smart girl," said Margulies. "I had a year's worth of work waiting and a mortgage completely paid at age 32. I was under no illusion that I was going to be some big movie star. My dad said, 'If you got hit by a bus tomorrow, were you living your life truthfully, or were you waiting to get rich?' If I died and my soul started leaving my body, would I be looking down going, 'You idiot. You could have gone to Prague, you could have been on Broadway'? Those are the things I wanted to do."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After leaving the series, Margulies worked on stage and screen. On stage, she appeared in a [[MCC Theater]] production of [[Kate Robin]]'s ''Intrigue With Faye'', a [[Lincoln Center]] production of Jon Robin Baitz's ''Ten Unknowns'', and ''[[The Vagina Monologues]].'' Her film work after ''ER'' included ''[[Evelyn (movie)|Evelyn]]'' with [[Pierce Brosnan]] and ''[[Ghost Ship (2002 film)|Ghost Ship]]'' (2002) with [[Gabriel Byrne]] and [[Ron Eldard]]. She starred as the [[protagonist]] and narrator ([[Morgan le Fay|Morgaine]]) in the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] miniseries ''[[The Mists of Avalon (miniseries)|The Mists of Avalon]]'' (2001) and participated in the  documentary film ''[[Searching for Debra Winger]]'' (2002).

In 2004, she guest-starred in a two-episode arc in season 4 of the hit TV show ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' as Neena Broderick, an unscrupulous lawyer who sues [[Christopher Turk|Turk]] and has a brief sexual relationship with [[J.D. (Scrubs)|J.D]]. She starred in another miniseries on TNT, ''[[The Grid (miniseries)|The Grid]].'' In April 2006, she appeared in four episodes of the sixth season of ''[[The Sopranos]],'' portraying realtor Julianna Skiff. In August 2006, she appeared in ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' as [[flight attendant]] Claire Miller. In December 2006, she played Jennifer Bloom in the [[Syfy|Syfy Channel]] miniseries ''[[The Lost Room]]''.

[[File:Julianna Margulies at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Margulies at the 2009 [[Tribeca Film Festival]]]]
In an August 2006 interview with [[TV Guide|tvguide.com]], Margulies said she was close to accepting an offer to return to ''ER'' for a four-episode arc, with [[Noah Wyle]], that filmed in Hawaii during the 2005/06 season. However, she decided against it at the last minute. Margulies was invited to return during ''ER'''s final season, but the actress initially turned down the offer, saying she felt like she left Carol Hathaway in the perfect place and could not imagine bettering her departure episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7732947.stm|title=Margulies turns down ER comeback |accessdate=November 23, 2008 | date=November 17, 2008|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Margulies did return to ''ER'' for one episode during its 15th and final season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= ER Bringing Back Clooney with Margulies before Checking Out | url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/ER-Clooney-Margulies-1002020.aspx | work= TVGuide.com | year=2009 | accessdate=January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a minor role in ''[[The Darwin Awards (film)|The Darwin Awards]]'' (2007). In 2008, Margulies starred in the legal series ''[[Canterbury's Law]],'' a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] mid-season replacement show. She played the title character, Elizabeth Canterbury, a lawyer described as a "tough-minded defense attorney who isn't afraid to push boundaries in order to protect innocent clients." She was also credited as a producer of the show. The series was severely affected by the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]]; it was cancelled by the network after only six episodes.

In 2009, Margulies began starring in the [[CBS]] legal drama ''[[The Good Wife]].'' She played Alicia Florrick, an [[Attorney at law|attorney]] returning to legal practice after her husband Peter Florrick (played by [[Chris Noth]]) resigned as [[Illinois]] State's Attorney amid a sex and corruption scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=TV Review: The Good Wife |first=Ken |last=Tucker |work=Entertainment Weekly |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20304585,00.html |date=September 15, 2009 |accessdate=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2011, starting with the third season, Margulies was credited as a producer of ''The Good Wife.'' The series ended in May 2016.

Since 2013, the actress does voiceovers for a [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] credit card commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chase Freedom '5% Cash Back' Commercials |url=http://adwhois.com/tag/julianna-margulies-commercial/|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Margulies narrated "Women in Business", an episode of season 2 of ''[[Makers: Women Who Make America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Business |url=https://www.pbs.org/makers/season-two/women-in-business/ |publisher=PBS|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' featured Margulies as one of the "100 Most Influential People in the World." It noted her work to get [[Erin Merryn|Erin's Law]], concerned with child sexual abuse, passed in every US state.&lt;ref name=Time100 /&gt;

In 2018, Margulies co-starred in the dark comedy series ''[[Dietland (TV series)|Dietland]]'' on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] as Kitty Montgomery - a nasty, razor-thin fashionista who employs an overweight woman for menial tasks and enjoys torturing her no end (especially about her weight).

=== KFUPM Endowment ===
It was announced in 2007 that the University will establish an independent administrative body tasked with managing and overseeing donations and the University's industry collaboration activities. The Endowment Fund Office is composed of an independent governing board, with a professional staff that manages the Fund's operations, resembling those of Harvard Investment Group and the Yale Investment Office. The KFUPM Fund is the first in Saudi Arabia to be professionally managed by specialized finance and investment teams. The mission of the Fund is to be able to provide the necessary financing (up to 30%) the University needs in the future, and cover costs that aren't sponsored by the University's main funds source, The Ministry of Education. In just over five years, the Endowment has grown to be the largest university endowment in Saudi Arabia (relative to the size of KFUPM budget) and was able to raise more than $500 million in financial assets along with real estate assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.kfupm.edu.sa/kfupmfund/Default.aspx#page/12|title=::: KFUPM Endowment :::|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Endowment's main investment projects include the establishment of a business park in the north side of the KFUPM campus that includes constructing numerous hotels and office buildings. The University has contracted the UK-based Marts &amp; Lundy to consult on fundraising and managing activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.kfupm.edu.sa/kfupmfund/News.aspx?nid=48|title=::: KFUPM Endowment :::|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fund's main financing activities include the establishment of specific-purpose research grants and projects. In addition, the Endowment has announced the creation of 8 doctoral fellowships (the first of its kind in the kingdom that is unrelated to governmental constraints in terms of funding).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.kfupm.edu.sa/kfupmfund/News.aspx?nid=47|title=::: KFUPM Endowment :::|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10261">The '''knowledge divide''' is the gap in standards of living between those who can find, create, manage, process, and disseminate information or knowledge, and those who are impaired in this process. According to a 2005 UNESCO World Report, the rise in the 21st century of a global information society has resulted in the emergence of knowledge as a valuable resource, increasingly determining who has access to power and profit.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Report: Toward Knowledge Societies (Paris: UNESCO, 2005), 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid dissemination of information on a potentially global scale as a result of new information media&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and the globally uneven ability to assimilate knowledge and information has resulted in potentially expanding gaps in knowledge between individuals and nations.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, "Knowledge as a Global Public Good," in Global Public Goods: International Cooperation in the 21st Century, ed. I. Kahl et al. (Oxford University Press, 1999), 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

In the 21st century, the emergence of the [[knowledge society]] becomes pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]] World Report (2005) Towards Knowledge Societies; retrieved from http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001418/141843e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The transformations of world's economy and of each society have a fast pace. Together with information and communication technologies ([[Information technology|ICT]]) these new paradigms have the power to reshape the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;Information Society Commission (2002). Building the Knowledge Society - Report to Government, December 2002 retrieved from http://www.isc.ie/downloads/know.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In order to keep pace with innovations, to come up with new ideas, people need to produce and manage knowledge. This is why knowledge has become essential for all societies.

==Between nations==

According to [[UNESCO]] and the [[World Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report: Knowledge for Development (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge gaps between nations may occur due to the varying degrees by which individual nations incorporate the following elements:

* ''Human rights and fundamental freedoms'': An absence of freedom within a society can diminish or delay the ability of its members to acquire, debate, and transmit knowledge.  Vital to the spread of knowledge and information between nations are such freedoms as [[freedom of expression]], an absence of censorship, free circulation of information, and [[freedom of the press]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Democracy]]''
* ''Plurality of knowledge and information'': This includes a diverse media&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and the acceptance of diverse forms of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Quality infrastructure'': For instance, a poor electrical grid makes the existence of computer networks or of higher education institutions less attainable.
* ''Effective communication system'': This will affect the dissemination of knowledge or movement of ideas within and between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317-318.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Effective education system'': Gaps in knowledge between nations can exist when individual countries invest too little in primary school education, which acts as the base for the entire education system.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[UNESCO]], in order for a nation to become a knowledge society, primary education must focus on basic literacy and must be universally accessible.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as others have pointed out, higher education may be equally important for closing knowledge gaps between nations, particularly between newly industrialized nations, such as the Republic of Korea, and more advanced industrial societies.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the former, higher education can play an important role in bridging knowledge gaps, but must benefit more than a small elite portion of the population and must be taught at international standards.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 317.&lt;/ref&gt; The poor development of educational institutions from a society affects the creativity of people belonging to that society.
* ''Focus on Research and Innovation'': As the [[World Bank]] suggests, [[Research &amp; Development]] within a nation can enable it to follow current developments in global knowledge and also to understand how to adapt external knowledge and technology to meet its needs.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report, 1999, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  In nations with low degrees of R&amp;D, government funding can provide a significant portion of support that can later be taken over by private investment.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report, 1999, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Closely tied to effective education systems is the need for a nation to allow for academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because higher educational institutions are significant contributors to R&amp;D,&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report 1999, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; these institutions must be granted freedom to create and disseminate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  An environment supportive of research and innovation may also help stem the "[[brain drain]]" of educated individuals from knowledge-poor nations to knowledge-rich nations.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Intellectual Property Rights'': Closely connected to a focus on research and innovation are national and international Intellectual Property Rights. Within a nation, Intellectual Property Rights can spawn research and innovation by providing economic incentives for investing in new knowledge development.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as stated by the [[World Bank]], by protecting innovations, intellectual property rights may also inhibit knowledge-sharing and may prevent developing nations from benefitting from knowledge produced in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank World Development Report 1999, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital divide==

The information and ICT systems that support knowledge are very important. This is why digitization is viewed closely related to knowledge. Scientists generally agree that there is a [[digital divide]], recently different reports also showed the existence of knowledge divide.&lt;ref&gt;Information Society Commission, 2002; UNESCO, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation and effective use of knowledge are increasingly related to the development of an ICT infrastructure. Without ICT, it is impossible to have an infrastructure able to process the huge flow of information required in an advanced economy. In particular, without adequate technical support, it is difficult to develop and use e-learning and electronic documents to overcome time and space constraints.

The digital divide is, however, but one important part of the larger knowledge divide.  As UNESCO states, "closing the digital divide will not suffice to close the knowledge divide, for access to useful, relevant knowledge is more than simply a matter of infrastructure—it depends on training, cognitive skills and regulatory frameworks geared towards access to contents."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 2005, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

In the book Digital Dead End, Virginia Eubanks criticizes the way that the digital divide is generally thought of as a division between haves and have-nots, where the solution is distribution. This over simplistic depiction obscures the fact that often social and [[structural inequality]] is at the root of the divide. According to a study done by Eubanks with women of the YWCA, the women of the community "insisted that have-nots possess many different kinds of crucial information and skills." In other words, it is not simply knowledge of the technology itself that is the issue but the structural system based on perpetuating the status quo in which the haves "hoard" knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Eubanks, V. (2011). Digital dead end: fighting for social justice in the information age. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In gender, race, ethnicity and social class==

First, it was noticed that a great difference exists between the [[North-South divide|North and the South]] {{Where|date=July 2011}} (rich countries vs. poor countries). The development of knowledge depends on spreading Internet and computer technology and also on the development of education in these countries. If a country has attained a higher literacy level then this will result in having higher level of knowledge.
Indeed, UNESCO's report details many social issues in knowledge divide related to globalization. There was noticed a knowledge divide with respect to
* Gender: Socio-cultural inequalities between men and women, such as unequal access to education and technology, create the conditions for unequal access to knowledge.  This can cause significant knowledge gaps both within and between nations, the latter resulting from individual nations' underutilization of their full knowledge workforce.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO World Report 2005, 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Race
* Ethnicity
* Social class

'''Learning''' is the process of acquiring new, or modifying existing, [[knowledge]], [[behavior]]s, [[skill]]s, [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]s, or [[preference]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gross, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cle1Fcr_6_QC&amp;pg=PT335 Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour] 6E, Hachette UK, {{ISBN|9781444164367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some [[machine learning|machines]]; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in some plants.&lt;ref&gt;Karban, R. (2015). Plant Learning and Memory. In: ''Plant Sensing and Communication''. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 31-44, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8HOeCQAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt; Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulates from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book | title=Psychology, 2nd edition | publisher=Worth Publishers |author1=Daniel L. Schacter |author2=Daniel T. Gilbert |author3=Daniel M. Wegner | origyear=2009| year=2011 | pages=264 | isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human learning begins before birth and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between person and environment. The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many fields, including [[educational psychology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[experimental psychology]], and [[pedagogy]]. Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning. For example, learning may occur as a result of [[habituation]], or [[classical conditioning]], [[operant conditioning]] or as a result of more complex activities such as [[play (activity)|play]], seen only in relatively intelligent animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm Jungle Gyms: The Evolution of Animal Play] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011051238/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1996/1/junglegyms.cfm |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/behavior.php|title=What behavior can we expect of octopuses? - The Cephalopod Page|author=|date=|website=www.thecephalopodpage.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005135515/http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/behavior.php|archivedate=5 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning may occur [[conscious]]ly or without conscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided nor escaped may result in a condition called [[learned helplessness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|1380861|Learned helplessness}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence for human behavioral learning [[prenatal]]ly, in which [[habituation]] has been observed as early as 32 weeks into [[gestation]], indicating that the [[central nervous system]] is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and [[memory]] to occur very early on in [[developmental psychology|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sandman | first1 = Wadhwa | last2 = Hetrick | first2 = Porto | last3 = Peeke | year = 1997 | title = Human fetal heart rate dishabituation between thirty and thirty-two weeks gestation | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 68 | issue = 6| pages = 1031–1040 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1997.tb01982.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play has been approached by several theorists as the first form of learning. Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play. [[Lev Vygotsky]] agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games.

=== Non-associative learning ===
''Non-associative learning'' refers to "a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus. Changes due to such factors as [[sensory adaptation]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or injury do not qualify as non-associative learning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/314/Non-associativeLearning.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103191805/http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/314/Non-associativeLearning.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-associative learning can be divided into [[habituation]] and [[sensitization]].

==== Habituation ====
{{Main|Habituation}}
''Habituation'' is an example of non-associative learning in which the strength or probability of a response diminishes when the stimulus is repeated. The response is typically a reflex or unconditioned response. Thus, habituation must be distinguished from [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]], which is an associative process. In operant extinction, for example, a response declines because it is no longer followed by a reward. An example of habituation can be seen in small song birds—if a stuffed [[owl]] (or similar [[predator]]) is put into the cage, the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator. Soon the birds react less, showing habituation. If another stuffed owl is introduced (or the same one removed and re-introduced), the birds react to it again as though it were a predator, demonstrating that it is only a very specific stimulus that is habituated to (namely, one particular unmoving owl in one place). The habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Science of Learning|last=Pear|first=Joseph|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2014|isbn=9781317762805|location=London|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal, as well as the sensitive plant ''[[Mimosa pudica]]''&lt;ref name="gagliano2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gagliano | first1 = M. | display-authors = etal | year = 2014 | title = Experience teaches plants to learn faster and forget slower in environments where it matters | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume = 175 | issue = 1| pages = 63–72 | doi=10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7| pmid = 24390479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the large protozoan ''[[Stentor coeruleus]]''.&lt;ref name="wood1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.C. | year = 1988 | title = Habituation in ''Stentor'' produced by mechanoreceptor channel modification | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 2254 | issue = | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept acts in direct opposition to sensitization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Sensitization ====
{{Main|Sensitization}}
''Sensitization'' is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a [[stimulation|stimulus]] (Bell et al., 1995).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This is based on the notion that a defensive reflex to a stimulus such as withdrawal or escape becomes stronger after the exposure to a different harmful or threatening stimulus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neurosciences - From Molecule to Behavior: a university textbook|last=Galizia|first=Giovanni|last2=Lledo|first2=Pierre-Marie|publisher=Springer Spektrum|year=2013|isbn=9783642107689|location=Heidelberg|pages=578}}&lt;/ref&gt; An everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously. After a while, this stimulation creates a warm sensation that eventually turns painful. The pain results from the progressively amplified synaptic response of the peripheral nerves warning that the stimulation is harmful.{{clarify|date=January 2011}} Sensitisation is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Active learning ===
{{main|Active learning}}

[[File:Learning_Retention_Pyramid.JPG|thumb|[[Experiential learning]] is more efficient than passive learning like reading or listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015|title=Hierarchy of Skills|first=|last=Igor Kokcharov, Ph.D, PMP|date=22 May 2015|website=slideshare.net|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161217164955/http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015|archivedate=17 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''Active learning'' occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience. Since understanding information is the key aspect of learning, it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not. By doing so, they can monitor their own mastery of subjects. Active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings. This and other meta-cognitive strategies can be taught to a child over time. Studies within [[metacognition]] have proven the value in active learning, claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[(Bransford, 2000, pg.15-20)]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong| journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning| year = 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140916150012/https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| archivedate = 2014-09-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Active learning is a key characteristic of [[student-centered learning]]. Conversely, [[passive learning]] and [[direct instruction]] are characteristics of teacher-centered learning (or [[traditional education]]).

The [[research]] works on the human learning process as a [[complex adaptive system]] developed by [[Peter Belohlavek]] showed that it is the concept that the individual has that drives the accommodation process to assimilate new knowledge in the [[long-term memory]], defining learning as an intrinsically freedom-oriented and active process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Ferro|first= María Laura|date=2003-01-05|title= Teoría Unicista: Otra manera de aprender|magazine= Revista Nueva|location= Nº 599, p. 10-12|publisher= Agrupación Diarios del Interior}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[student-centered learning]] approach, the unicist reflection driven learning installs adaptive knowledge objects in the mind of the learner based on a cyclic process of: “action-reflection-action” to foster an [[adaptive behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Caldas|first= Sérgio Túlio|date=1990-08-30|title= Economista cria centro de estudo empresarial|url= |work= O Estado de São Paulo|location= Economia, p. 9 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3161708|title= Unicist Reflection Driven Learning for Superior Education|last= Belohlavek|first=Peter|date=2018-04-12|website= |publisher=SSRN|access-date= 2018-09-29|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Associative learning ===
''Associative learning'' is the process by which a person or animal learns an association between two stimuli or events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovery Series: Introduction to Psychology|last=Plotnik|first=Rod|last2=Kouyomdijan|first2=Haig|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=9781111347024|location=Belmont, CA|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical conditioning a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with a reflex eliciting stimulus until eventually the neutral stimulus elicits a response on its own. In operant conditioning, a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus.

==== Operant conditioning ====
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
In ''operant conditioning'', a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment given after a given behavior, change the frequency and/or form of that behavior. Stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications.

==== Classical conditioning ====
{{Main|Classical conditioning}}
The typical paradigm for ''classical conditioning'' involves repeatedly pairing an unconditioned stimulus (which unfailingly evokes a reflexive response) with another previously neutral stimulus (which does not normally evoke the response). Following conditioning, the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other, unrelated stimulus (now referred to as the "conditioned stimulus"). The response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a ''conditioned response''. The classic example is [[Ivan Pavlov]] and his dogs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pavlov fed his dogs meat powder, which naturally made the dogs salivate—salivating is a reflexive response to the meat powder. Meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus (US) and the salivation is the unconditioned response (UR). Pavlov rang a bell before presenting the meat powder. The first time Pavlov rang the bell, the neutral stimulus, the dogs did not salivate, but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate. After numerous pairings of bell and food, the dogs learned that the bell signaled that food was about to come, and began to salivate when they heard the bell. Once this occurred, the bell became the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response (CR). Classical conditioning has been demonstrated in many species. For example, it is seen in honeybees, in the [[proboscis extension reflex]] paradigm.&lt;ref name="bitterman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bitterman | display-authors = etal | year = 1983 | title = Classical Conditioning of Proboscis Extension in Honeybees (''Apis mellifera'') | url = | journal = J. Comp. Psychol. | volume = 97 | issue = 2| pages = 107–119 | doi=10.1037/0735-7036.97.2.107}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recently also demonstrated in garden pea plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagliano|first=Monica|last2=Vyazovskiy|first2=Vladyslav V.|last3=Borbély|first3=Alexander A.|last4=Grimonprez|first4=Mavra|last5=Depczynski|first5=Martial|date=2016-12-02|title=Learning by Association in Plants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=38427|doi=10.1038/srep38427|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5133544|pmid=27910933|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623143237/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427|archivedate=2017-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential person in the world of classical conditioning is [[John B. Watson]]. Watson's work was very influential and paved the way for [[B.F. Skinner]]'s radical behaviorism. Watson's behaviorism (and philosophy of science) stood in direct contrast to Freud and other accounts based largely on introspection. Watson's view was that the introspective method was too subjective, and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors. In 1913, Watson published the article "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views," in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science. Watson's most famous, and controversial, experiment, "[[Little Albert]]", where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles.

==== Observational learning ====
{{Main|Observational learning}}
''Observational learning'' is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings.

==== Imprinting ====
{{Main|Imprinting (psychology)}}
''Imprinting'' is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior. In filial imprinting, young animals, particularly birds, form an association with another individual or in some cases, an object, that they respond to as they would to a parent. In 1935, the Austrian Zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds.

=== Play ===
{{Main|Play (activity)}}
''Play'' generally describes behavior with no particular end in itself, but that improves performance in similar future situations. This is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans, but is mostly limited to [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s. Cats are known to play with a ball of string when young, which gives them experience with catching prey. Besides inanimate objects, animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals, such as [[orca]]s playing with seals they have caught. Play involves a significant cost to animals, such as increased vulnerability to [[predator]]s and the risk of [[injury]] and possibly [[infection]]. It also consumes [[energy]], so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved. Play is generally seen in younger animals, suggesting a link with learning. However, it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning, for example improving [[physical fitness]].

Play, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child's learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.&lt;ref name="Lillemyr, O.F. 2009"&gt;Lillemyr, O.F. (2009). Taking play seriously. Children and play in early childhood education: an exciting challenge. Charlotte, NC: Information Age Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five types of play:
# sensorimotor play aka functional play, characterized by repetition of activity
# role play occurs starting at the age of 3
# rule-based play where authoritative prescribed codes of conduct are primary
# construction play involves experimentation and building
# movement play aka physical play&lt;ref name="Lillemyr, O.F. 2009"/&gt;

These five types of play are often intersecting. All types of play generate thinking and [[problem-solving]] skills in children. Children learn to think creatively when they learn through play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitebread | first1 = D. | last2 = Coltman | first2 = P. | last3 = Jameson | first3 = H. | last4 = Lander | first4 = R. | year = 2009 | title = Play, cognition and self-regulation: What exactly are children learning when they learn through play? | url = | journal = Educational &amp; Child Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 40–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan. Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting with others.

=== Enculturation ===
{{Main|Enculturation}}
''Enculturation'' is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"&gt;Grusec, Joan E.; Hastings, Paul D. "Handbook of Socialization: Theory and Research", 2007, Guilford Press; {{ISBN|1-59385-332-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-332-7}}; at page 547.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents, other adults, and peers shape the individual's understanding of these values.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt; If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values and rituals of the culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt; This is different from [[acculturation]], where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native one.

Multiple examples of enculturation can be found cross-culturally. Collaborative practices in the Mazahua people have shown that participation in everyday interaction and later learning activities contributed to enculturation rooted in nonverbal social experience.&lt;ref name="Paradise1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paradise|first1=Ruth|title=Interactional Style and Nonverbal Meaning: Mazahua Children Learning How to Be Separate-But-Together|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|date=1994|doi=10.1525/aeq.1994.25.2.05x0907w|volume=25|issue=2|pages=156–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the children participated in everyday activities, they learned the cultural significance of these interactions. The collaborative and helpful behaviors exhibited by Mexican and Mexican-heritage children is a cultural practice known as being "acomedido".&lt;ref name=Lopez2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Angelica|last2=Najafi|first2=Behnosh|last3=Rogoff|first3=Barbara|last4=Mejia-Arauz|first4=Rebeca|title=Collaboration and helping as cultural practices|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Culture and Psychology|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chillihuani girls in Peru described themselves as weaving constantly, following behavior shown by the other adults.&lt;ref name=Bolin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolin|first1=Inge|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Childrearing in highland Peru|date=2006|publisher=University of Texas|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-71298-0|pages=90–99|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Episodic learning ===
''Episodic learning'' is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, W. S. (2006). Learning and Memory: Basic principles, processes, and procedures. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a fear of dogs that follows being bitten by a dog is episodic learning. Episodic learning is so named because events are recorded into [[episodic memory]], which is one of the three forms of explicit learning and retrieval, along with perceptual memory and [[semantic memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Baars, B. J. &amp; Gage, N. M. (2007). Cognition, Brain, and Consciousness: Introduction to cognitive neuroscience. London: Elsevier Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Episodic memory remembers events and history that are embedded in experience and this is distinguished from semantic memory, which attempts to extract facts out of their experiential context&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sixth International Conference on Cognitive Modeling: ICCM - 2004|last=Lovett|first=Marsha|last2=Schunn|first2=Christian|last3=Lebiere|first3=Christian|last4=Munro|first4=Paul|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers|year=2004|isbn=978-0805854268|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; or - as some describe - a timeless organization of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artificial Intelligence: Critical Concepts, Volume 1|last=Chrisley|first=Ronald|last2=Begeer|first2=Sander|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0415193320|location=London|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a person remembers the [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] from a recent visit, it is an episodic memory. He would use semantic memory to answer someone who would ask him information such as where the Grand Canyon is. A study revealed that humans are very accurate in the recognition of episodic memory even without deliberate intention to memorize it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Cognitive Neuroscience: A Beginner's Guide|last=Gage|first=Nicole|last2=Baars|first2=Bernard|publisher=Academic Press|year=2018|isbn=9780128038130|location=London|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to indicate a very large storage capacity of the brain for things that people pay attention to.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Multimedia learning ===
{{Main|Multimedia learning}}
''Multimedia learning'' is where a person uses both auditory and visual stimuli to learn information {{Harv|Mayer|2001}}. This type of learning relies on [[dual-coding theory]] {{Harv|Paivio|1971}}.

=== E-learning and augmented learning ===
{{Main|Electronic learning}}
''Electronic learning'' or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning. A specific and always more diffused e-learning is [[mobile learning]] (m-learning), which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment, such as [[cellular phone]]s.

When a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it's called [[augmented learning]]. By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime.&lt;ref name="Augmented Learning"&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1156186 Augmented Learning], Augmented Learning: Context-Aware Mobile Augmented Reality Architecture for Learning&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[minimally invasive education]].

Moore (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = M | year = 1989 | title = Three types of interaction | url = | journal = American Journal of Distance Education | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1080/08923648909526659| citeseerx = 10.1.1.491.4800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality, effective online learning:
* learner–learner (i.e. communication between and among peers with or without the teacher present),
* learner–instructor (i.e. student teacher communication), and
* learner–content (i.e. intellectually interacting with content that results in changes in learners' understanding, perceptions, and cognitive structures).
In his theory of transactional distance, Moore (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. G. (1993). Theory of transactional distance. In D. Keegan (Ed.), Theoretical principles of distance education (pp. 22-38). London and New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; contented that structure and interaction or dialogue bridge the gap in understanding and communication that is created by geographical distances (known as transactional distance).

=== Rote learning ===
{{Main|Rote learning}}
''Rote learning'' is [[memorizing]] information so that it can be [[recollection|recalled]] by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. The major technique used for rote learning is ''learning by repetition'', based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed. Rote learning is used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion. Although it has been criticized by some educators, rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning.

=== Meaningful learning ===
{{See also|Deeper Learning}}
''Meaningful learning'' is the concept that learned knowledge (e.g., a fact) is fully understood to the extent that it relates to other knowledge. To this end, meaningful learning contrasts with [[rote learning]] in which information is acquired without regard to understanding. Meaningful learning, on the other hand, implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassard|first=Jack|title=Backup of Meaningful Learning Model|url=http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|accessdate=30 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029042955/http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/advorgbk02.htm|archivedate=29 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informal learning ===
{{Main|Informal learning}}
''Informal learning'' occurs through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at table with parents, [[play (activity)|play]], exploring, etc.

=== Formal learning ===
{{Main|Education}}
[[Image:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|right|225px|thumb|A depiction of the world's oldest continually operating university, the [[University of Bologna]], Italy]]
''Formal learning'' is learning that takes place within a teacher-student relationship, such as in a school system. The term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning, but rather the way it is directed and organized. In formal learning, the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, J., and Dale, M., [http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html " Informal Learning in the Workplace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121140538/http://www.knowledgejump.com/learning/informal.html |date=2013-01-21 }}, '' Department for Education and Employment Research Report No. 134. London, England: Department for Education and Employment'', August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonformal learning ===
{{Main|Nonformal learning}}
''Nonformal learning'' is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, workshops.

=== Nonformal learning and combined approaches ===
The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to get experience in organizing, [[teaching]], etc.

To learn a skill, such as solving a [[Rubik's Cube]] quickly, several factors come into play at once:
* Reading directions helps a player learn the patterns that solve the Rubik's Cube.
* Practicing the moves repeatedly helps build "[[muscle memory]]" and speed.
* Thinking critically about moves helps find shortcuts, which speeds future attempts.
* Observing the Rubik's Cube's six colors help anchor solutions in the mind.
* Revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill.

=== Tangential learning ===
''Tangential learning'' is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy. For example, after playing a music-based video game, some people may be motivated to learn how to play a real instrument, or after watching a TV show that references Faust and Lovecraft, some people may be inspired to read the original work.&lt;ref&gt;Tangential Learning {{cite web |url=http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104053746/http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/tangential-learning |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-education can be improved with systematization. According to experts in natural learning,
self-oriented learning training has proven an effective tool for assisting independent learners with the natural phases of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;context=marketing_papers | title = The Natural Learning Project | author = J.

''[[Extra Credits]]'' writer and game designer James Portnow was the first to suggest games as a potential venue for "tangential learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Rath,|date=2015-01-22|title=Game Criticism as Tangential Learning Facilitator: The Case of Critical Intel|url=http://gamescriticism.org/articles/rath-2-1/|journal=Journal of Games Criticism|language=en-US|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozelius ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mozelius et al|first=|date=|title=Motivating Factors and Tangential Learning for Knowledge Acquisition in Educational Games|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1154724.pdf|journal=The Electronic Journal of E-Learning|volume= 15| issue = 4 2017|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that intrinsic integration of learning content seems to be a crucial design factor, and that games that include modules for further self-studies tend to present good results. The built-in encyclopedias in the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' games are presented as an example - by using these modules gamers can dig deeper for knowledge about historical events in the gameplay. The importance of rules that regulate learning modules and game experience is discussed by Moreno, C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=Carlos|date=|year=2014|title=Kiwaka {{!}} Kiwaka Story (by LANDKA®)|url=http://www.lifeplay.es/volumen3/Analisis/067_070_RAMIREZ_MORENO_Analisis.pdf|journal=LifePlay|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a case study about the mobile game {{Wikidata entity link| Q55416666}}.

=== Dialogic learning ===
{{Main|Dialogic learning}}
''Dialogic learning'' is a type of learning based on dialogue.

=== Incidental learning ===
In ''incidental teaching'' learning is not planned by the instructor or the student, it occurs as a byproduct of another activity — an experience, observation, self-reflection, interaction, unique event, or common routine task. This learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor's plans and the student's expectations. An example of incidental teaching is when the instructor places a train set on top of a cabinet. If the child points or walks towards the cabinet, the instructor prompts the student to say “train.” Once the student says “train,” he gets access to the train set.

Here are some steps most commonly used in incidental teaching:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|title=What is incidental teaching?|year=2017|website=North Shore Pediatric Therapy, Illinois|access-date=August 29, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829204217/http://nspt4kids.com/healthtopics-and-conditions-database/incidental-teaching/|archivedate=August 29, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An instructor will arrange the learning environment so that necessary materials are within the student's sight, but not within his reach, thus impacting his motivation to seek out those materials.
* An instructor waits for the student to initiate engagement.
* An instructor prompts the student to respond if needed.
* An instructor allows access to an item/activity contingent on a correct response from the student.
* The instructor fades out the prompting process over a period of time and subsequent trials.

Incidental learning is an occurrence that is not generally accounted for using the traditional methods of instructional objectives and outcomes assessment. This type of learning occurs in part as a product of social interaction and active involvement in both online and onsite courses. Research implies that some un-assessed aspects of onsite and online learning challenge the equivalency of education between the two modalities. Both onsite and online learning have distinct advantages with traditional on-campus students experiencing higher degrees of incidental learning in three times as many areas as online students. Additional research is called for to investigate the implications of these findings both conceptually and pedagogically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konetes|first1=George|title=The Effects of Distance Education and Student Involvement on Incidental Learning|journal=IUP Doctoral Dissertations|date=2011|pages=115|url=https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=Incidental Learning|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130414/https://dspace.iup.edu/bitstream/handle/2069/477/George%20Konetes.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domains ==
[[File:France in XXI Century. School.jpg|thumb|270px|''Future school'' (1901 or 1910)]]
[[Benjamin Bloom]] has suggested three domains of learning:
* [[Cognitive]]: To recall, calculate, discuss, analyze, problem solve, etc.
* [[Psychomotor learning|Psychomotor]]: To dance, swim, ski, dive, drive a car, ride a bike, etc.
* [[Affective]]: To like something or someone, love, appreciate, fear, hate, worship, etc.

These domains are not mutually exclusive. For example, in learning to play [[chess]], the person must learn the rules (cognitive domain)—but must also learn how to set up the chess pieces and how to properly hold and move a chess piece (psychomotor). Furthermore, later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself, value its applications in life, and appreciate its [[history of chess|history]] (affective domain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessballs.com/bloomstaxonomyoflearningdomains.htm|title=Bloom's Taxonomy|author=|date=|website=www.businessballs.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer ==
Transfer of learning is the application of skill, knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled. Research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent; most common when "... cued, primed, and guided..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=D.N.|author2=Salomon, G. |title=Are Cognitive Skills Context-Bound?|journal=Educational Researcher|date=Jan–Feb 1989|volume=18|issue=1|pages=16–25 [19]|doi=10.3102/0013189x018001016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has sought to clarify what it is, and how it might be promoted through instruction.

Over the history of its discourse, various hypotheses and definitions have been advanced. First, it is speculated that different types of transfer exist, including: near transfer, the application of skill to solve a novel problem in a similar context; and far transfer, the application of skill to solve novel problem presented in a different context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning with additional material from the Committee on Learning Research|title=Chapter 3. Learning and Transfer. How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School: Expanded Edition|year=2000|publisher=The National Academies Press|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9853|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426234827/http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9853|archivedate=2013-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Perkins and Salomon (1992) suggest that positive transfer in cases when learning supports novel problem solving, and negative transfer occurs when prior learning inhibits performance on highly correlated tasks, such as second or third-language learning.&lt;ref name="Perkins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=D.N.|author2=Salomon, G. |title=Transfer of Learning|journal=International Encyclopedia of Education|year=1992|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts of positive and negative transfer have a long history; researchers in the early 20th century described the possibility that "...habits or mental acts developed by a particular kind of training may inhibit rather than facilitate other mental activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Agnes L.|title=The Bearing of the New Psychology upon the Teaching of Mathematics|journal=Teacher's College Record|year=1916|volume=17|pages=344–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Schwarz, Bransford and Sears (2005) have proposed that transferring knowledge into a situation may differ from transferring knowledge out to a situation as a means to reconcile findings that transfer may both be frequent and challenging to promote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz, Daniel L., John D. Bransford, and David Sears|title=Efficiency and innovation in transfer: Transfer of learning from a modern multidisciplinary perspective|year=2005|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant and long research history has also attempted to explicate the conditions under which transfer of learning might occur. Early research by Ruger, for example, found that the "level of attention", "attitudes", "method of attack" (or method for tackling a problem), a "search for new points of view", "a careful testing of hypothesis" and "generalization" were all valuable approaches for promoting transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruger|first=Henry Alfred|title=The psychology of efficiency: an experimental study of the processes involved in the solution of mechanical puzzles and in the acquisition of skill in their manipulation|journal=Science Press|year=1910|volume=19|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage transfer through teaching, Perkins and Salomon recommend aligning ("hugging") instruction with practice and assessment, and "bridging", or encouraging learners to reflect on past experiences or make connections between prior knowledge and current content.&lt;ref name="Perkins" /&gt;

== Factors affecting learning ==

=== External factors ===
# ''[[Heredity]]'': A classroom instructor can neither change nor increase heredity, but the student can use and develop it. Some learners are rich in hereditary endowment while others are poor. Each student is unique and has different abilities. The native intelligence is different in individuals. Heredity governs or conditions our ability to learn and the rate of learning. The intelligent learners can establish and see relationship very easily and more quickly.
# ''Status of students'': Physical and home conditions also matter: Certain problems like malnutrition i.e.; inadequate supply of nutrients to the body, fatigue i.e.; tiredness, bodily weakness, and bad health are great obstructers in learning. These are some of the physical conditions by which a student can get affected. Home is a place where a family lives. If the home conditions are not proper, the student is affected seriously. Some of the home conditions are bad ventilation, unhygienic living, bad light, etc. These affect the student and his or her rate of learning.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangal|first1=S.K.|title=ESSENTIALS OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY|date=January 5, 2007|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd|isbn= 9788120330559|page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aggarwal|first1=J.C|title=Essentials Of Educational Psychology|date=November 1, 2009|publisher=Vikas Publishing House Pvt Ltd|isbn= 9788125922926|page=596|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Physical environment'': The design, quality, and setting of a [[learning space]], such as a school or classroom, can each be critical to the success of a [[learning environment]]. Size, configuration, comfort—fresh air, temperature, light, acoustics, furniture—can all affect a student's learning. The tools used by both instructors and students directly affect how information is conveyed, from display and writing surfaces (blackboards, markerboards, tack surfaces) to digital technologies. For example, if a room is too crowded, stress levels rise, student attention is reduced, and furniture arrangement is restricted. If furniture is incorrectly arranged, sight lines to the instructor or instructional material is limited and the ability to suit the learning or lesson style is restricted. Aesthetics can also play a role, for if student morale suffers, so does motivation to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources ''New Teachers: Designing Learning Environments'', May 7, 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328041804/http://www.edutopia.org/article/new-teachers-designing-classroom-learning-environment-resources |date=March 28, 2016 }}.

=== Internal factors ===
There are several internal factors that affect learning.&lt;ref name="Ref 3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangal|first1=SK|title=ADVANCED EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY|date=January 1, 2002|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd|isbn=9788120320383|page=536|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhatia|first1=H.R|title=Elements Of Educational Psychology|date=January 1, 1973|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn= 9788125000297|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are
# ''Goals or purposes'': Each and everyone has a goal. A goal should be set to each pupil according to the standard expected to him. A goal is an aim or desired result. There are 2 types of goals called immediate and distant goals. A goal that occurs or is done at once is called an ''immediate goal,'' and ''distant goals'' are those that take time to achieve. Immediate goals should be set before the young learner and distant goals for older learners. Goals should be specific and clear, so that learners understand.
# ''Motivational behavior'': Motivation means to provide with a motive. Motivation learners should be motivated so that they stimulate themselves with interest. This behavior arouses and regulates the student's internal energies.
# ''Interest'': This is a quality that arouses a feeling. It encourages a student to move over tasks further. During teaching, the instructor must raise interests among students for the best learning. Interest is an apparent (clearly seen or understood) behaviour.
# ''Attention'': Attention means consideration. It is concentration or focusing of consciousness upon one object or an idea. If effective learning should take place attention is essential. Instructors must secure the attention of the student.
# ''Drill or practice'': This method includes repeating the tasks "n" number of times like needs, phrases, principles, etc. This makes learning more effective.
# ''Fatigue'': Generally there are three types of fatigue, i.e., muscular, sensory, and mental. Muscular and sensory fatigues are bodily fatigue. Mental fatigue is in the central nervous system. The remedy is to change teaching methods, e.g., use audio-visual aids, etc.
# ''[[Aptitude]]'': Aptitude is natural ability. It is a condition in which an individuals ability to acquire certain skills, knowledge through training.
# ''[[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]]'': It is a way of thinking. The attitude of the student must be tested to find out how much inclination he or she has for learning a subject or topic.
# ''Emotional conditions'': Emotions are physiological states of being. Students who answer a question properly or give good results should be praised. This encouragement increases their ability and helps them produce better results. Certain attitudes, such as always finding fault in a student's answer or provoking or embarrassing the student in front of a class are counterproductive.
# ''Speed, Accuracy and retention'': Speed is the rapidity of movement. Retention is the act of retaining. These 3 elements depend upon aptitude, attitude, interest, attention and motivation of the students.
# ''Learning activities'': Learning depends upon the activities and experiences provided by the teacher, his concept of discipline, methods of teaching and above all his overall personality.
# ''Testing'': Various tests measure individual learner differences at the heart of effective learning. Testing helps eliminate subjective elements of measuring pupil differences and performances.
# ''Guidance'': Everyone needs guidance in some part or some time in life. Some need it constantly and some very rarely depending on the students conditions. Small learners need more guidance. Guidance is an advice to solve a problem. Guidance involves the art of helping boys and girls in various aspects of academics, improving vocational aspects like choosing careers and recreational aspects like choosing hobbies. Guidance covers the whole gamut of learners problems- learning as well as non- learning.

== In animal evolution ==
Animals gain knowledge in two ways. First is learning—in which an animal gathers information about its environment and uses this information. For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it learns not to eat that again. The second is innate knowledge that is genetically inherited. An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk. The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it.&lt;ref name="Dunlap"&gt;DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf. at &lt;{{cite web|url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113233355/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In some scenarios, [[Instinct|innate knowledge]] is more beneficial than learned knowledge. However, in other scenarios the opposite is true—animals must learn certain behaviors when it is disadvantageous to have a specific innate behavior. In these situations, learning [[Evolution|evolves]] in the species.

=== Costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge ===
In a changing environment, an animal must constantly gain new information to survive. However, in a stable environment, this same individual needs to gather the information it needs once, and then rely on it for the rest of its life. Therefore, different scenarios better suit either learning or innate knowledge.
Essentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation, or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighs the benefit of having it, then the animal does not evolve to learn in this scenario—but instead, non-learning evolves. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it, then the animal is far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt;

Non-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios. If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs, then learning is simply unnecessary. Because there is no need for learning in this scenario—and because learning could prove disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information—non-learning evolves. However, if an environment is in a constant state of change, then learning is disadvantageous. Anything learned is immediately irrelevant because of the changing environment.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt; The learned information no longer applies. Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned. In this situation, non-learning evolves. In fact, a study of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' showed that learning can actually lead to a decrease in productivity, possibly because egg-laying behaviors and decisions were impaired by interference from the memories gained from the new learned materials or because of the cost of energy in learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.12.005 | volume=68 | issue=3 | title=An operating cost of learning in Drosophila melanogaster | journal=Animal Behaviour | pages=589–598| year=2004 | last1=Mery | first1=Frederic | last2=Kawecki | first2=Tadeusz J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in environments where change occurs within an animal's lifetime but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve. Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can [[Adaptation|adapt]] to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time. Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing.&lt;ref name="Dunlap" /&gt; An example of this is seen in aquatic environments with landscapes subject to change. In these environments, learning is favored because the fish are predisposed to learn the specific spatial cues where they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Odling-Smee | first1 = L. | last2 = Braithwaite | first2 = V. A. | year = 2003 | title = The role of learning in fish orientation | url = | journal = Fish and Fisheries | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 235–246 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-2979.2003.00127.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine learning, a branch of [[artificial intelligence]], concerns the construction and study of systems that can learn from data. For example, a machine learning system could be trained on email messages to learn to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

'''Link-Systems International''', Inc. is a privately held [[Distance education|distance-learning]] software corporation based in Tampa, Florida, US.  The company is best known for [[NetTutor]], its online tutoring service, WorldWideTestbank, its platform for authoring online content, and its [[WorldWideWhiteboard]] education-focused online collaboration platform. Link-Systems International, Inc. ranked 3396 on the [[Inc. (magazine)|Inc. 5000]] in 2014.

==History==
Link-Systems International (LSI) was founded in 1995&lt;ref name="BWInfo"/&gt; and incorporated in the state of Florida on February 27, 1996. It started as an internet content authoring and repurposing service. For several years, LSI performed the conversion of scholarly content such as journals from earlier print-oriented formats to a format for Web display.

===From &amp;ldquo;NetTutor&amp;rdquo; to the WorldWideWhiteboard: 1997===

In 1997, LSI developers released a [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based application they called "NetTutor". This was an online educational interface that allowed participants and a "leader" to collaborate in real time. When the leader draws or places text, figures and symbols such as square-root and integral signs on a virtual whiteboard, they are simultaneously displayed on all users' screens. Other participants can "raise their hands" and be recognized by the leader, who can grant them access to draw or type on the whiteboard area. A secondary, instant messaging-style text area allows text-only communication. LSI leased this interface to educational partners (schools and textbook publishers, chiefly), but renamed the platform [[WorldWideWhiteboard]] in 2001 to distinguish it from its online tutoring service, which kept the name NetTutor.&lt;ref name="BWDigest"/&gt;

===NetTutor: 1998===
LSI launched the NetTutor online tutoring service in 1998. NetTutor uses the WorldWideWhiteboard and a proprietary queuing system. Students who log in gain access to professional tutors who provide assistance in specific subject areas. NetTutor employs the tutors on a full-time basis and only allows them to conduct their tutoring at a single physical site, namely, the LSI headquarters in Tampa. Other online tutoring services employ part-time tutors and allow them to tutor from any physical location.

Another distinction between NetTutor and other services is that a set of [[#Rules of Engagement|written guidelines]] is drawn up in consultation with client institutions and amended as needed. Such guidelines reinforce tutoring best practices, such as that tutors should prefer the Socratic method and scaffolding over simply answering questions. However, they also can be used to instruct tutors to adopt special practices preferred by the client. Some examples of tutoring guidelines are available on the Web.&lt;ref name="KentuckyROE" /&gt;

When institutions sponsor student access to NetTutor, it is usually linked to from the campus website or learning management system. NetTutor also maintains an [[eCommerce]] site through which students connect to receive tutoring and pay for it on their own.

===Content authoring and the WorldWideTestbank: 2002===
LSI developed the WorldWideTestbank platform for creating a wide variety of problem-types. True-false, multiple choice, and free input are the traditional ones, but the WorldWideTestbank also supports graphical and  [[Manipulative (mathematics education)|manipulative]] problem-types. The interface development environment of the WorldWideTestbank supports authors' programming in the platform's own scripting language and creates a "template" for each question. Depending on how it is programmed, a single template can yield an indefinite number of problems for a user to practice by inserting randomly selected numbers and phrases in each instance of the template. The WorldWideTestbank also enables an instructor to specify how close the student has to be to an exact correct answer to be "correct." For instance, in numerical answers, students may be required to express answers with a specific number of significant digits.

===IVS and MyAcademicWorkshop: 2010===
In 2010, LSI released two platforms: an educational institution analytics platform called Information Visibility Solutions™ (IVS) and a homework and assessment platform that combined features of the WorldWideTestbank and WorldWidewGradebook with an optional connection to tutoring called MyAcademicWorkshop™. IVS applies the alerts and notices features common in gradebook applications, but at an enterprise level and with user-definable dashboards. For IVS, which bridges different databases in which an institution may hold its data to display interrelated events about a college campus as the events are occurring,&lt;ref name="Mindshare2010"/&gt; LSI collaborated with Mindshare, Inc. in nearby Clearwater, Florida, a company that already had developed analytics for the state of Florida;&lt;ref name="Mindshare2012"/&gt; MyAcademicWorkshop enables schools to place students into one of a number developmental math courses and provides content for these courses aligned to state or national standards.

===HTML5 and Mobile Readiness: 2012===
In 2012, LSI began replacing the original, Java-based code of its platforms with [[HTML5]] so that its various platforms are more accessible and can be used on mobile devices. As of 2015, the WorldWideWhiteboard, NetTutor, and the WorldWideTestbank have been re-released in HTML5.

===Comfit and RTR: 2014===
By May 2014, LSI completed acquisition of the ComFit Online Learning Center.&lt;ref name="ReutersLSIAcquiresComfit"/&gt; ComFit uses an initial set of questions to try to pinpoint students' difficulties in reading and English, after which students work problems and win "medals" as they progress through learning goals.  In contrasts to the adaptive placement of MyAcademicWorkshop, which assigns a student to a course and emphasizes science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]), ComFit focuses on specific sets of learning goals and emphasizes English and writing objectives.

Also in 2014, LSI developed an automated tutoring referral system called Refer-Tutor-Report™ (RTR™). RTR accommodates four activities: teachers refer chosen students to tutoring for specified learning objectives, students receive notification of referrals and learn how to reach tutors, tutors find out what learning objectives students need to cover, and administrators garner reports about the tutoring referral process.

==LSI Clients==

===Educational Institutions===

Use of LSI platforms is part of a general turn by higher-education institutions to online instruction and student support.  The WorldWideWhiteboard went online at Pima Community College&lt;ref name="Turrentine2006"/&gt; and other institutions even before 2000. NetTutor, initially offered with new editions of textbooks in deals with publishing companies, is now available in community college systems and universities like the California Community College System (through the Online Education Initiative),&lt;ref name="CalOEI"/&gt; Mississippi's Virtual Community College System,&lt;ref name="MSVCCS"/&gt; and the Oregon State University eCampus.&lt;ref name="OSUECampus"/&gt; Many individual college campuses have adopted NetTutor or the WorldWideWhiteboard. At some schools, the collaborative whiteboard is used by campus tutors who conduct online tutoring. In a few cases, NetTutor becomes available automatically during hours when campus online tutoring is unavailable.

===Publishers===

LSI, through its content conversion services and conferencing and tutoring tools, became an early partner to textbook publishers. The NetTutor service was adopted as a value-added feature on new textbooks, whereby purchasers of the textbooks gained access to a certain number of hours of online tutoring.

NetTutor has been packaged over the years with textbooks published by [[John Wiley and Sons]], [[Pearson Education|Pearson]], [[Cengage Learning]],&lt;ref name="CengSite"/&gt; and [[Bedford-St. Martin's]], an imprint of [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan]]. LSI content authors have created material that appears in the homework systems associated with [[McGraw-Hill]], [[Cengage Learning]], MacMillan, and [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] and in such tools as [[MyMathLab]] and [[WebAssign]].

==Research and Questions==

===Education Research and LSI Platforms===

Recent research compares the performance of college students who use NetTutor to those who do not, and finds evidence that both performance and persistence improve among users of the service.&lt;ref name="Kersaint2011"/&gt; In other cases, schools&lt;ref name="UMSL2010"&gt;http://online.umsystem.edu/docs-policies/Report_on_Online_Tutoring_Services.pdf, July 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsubaki2011"&gt;Chikao Tsubaki (2010). "A Comparison of Two Online Tutoring Modes." ''MDLA Forums''. March 3, 2010. Retrieved April 22 from http://www-apps.umuc.edu/mdla_forums/showthread.php?t=102.&lt;/ref&gt; compared NetTutor favorably to its competitors on ground of price and flexibility of tutoring approach.

A study at [[Hampton University]] concluded in 1999 that the whiteboard could effectively support such activities as online office hours.&lt;ref name="Verma1999"/&gt;

In 2004, researchers at [[Stony Brook University]] concluded that "...according to our research NetTutor remains the only workable math-friendly e-learning communication system."&lt;ref name="Smith2004"/&gt;

A study at [[Utah Valley University]] in 2006 pointed out the role of the WorldWideWhiteboard as "[o]ne of the earliest synchronous models for math  tutoring]"&lt;ref name="Turrentine2006"/&gt;).

An example of live interaction on the WorldWhiteWhiteboard can be found in the online journal on writing instruction [[Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy|Kairos]].&lt;ref name="Hewett2001"/&gt;

By 2007, LSI's NetTutor service had conducted one million online tutorial sessions.&lt;ref name="LSI2007"/&gt;

==LSI and controversies surrounding distance learning software==

Online technology is shown to help develop a community of inquiry, which has been shown to improve student participation and results.&lt;ref name="Thomas2006"/&gt;  In particular, schools require students enrolling in online courses to complete inventories of personal study practices, since more commitment is required to complete online courses successfully.

The relative novelty of online tutoring also raises questions of tutor preparedness to support students on the internet, whether that support is delivered in real time (synchronously) or via exchange of documents (asynchronously)&lt;ref name="Hewitt2004"&gt;"How Do You Feel? Attitudes about Tutoring Online", Beth Hewett (2004). ''Praxis: A Writing Center Journal''. 1(2). Retrieved April 29, 2011 from http://projects.uwc.utexas.edu/praxis/?q=node/104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules of Engagement===

LSI platforms are used in conjunction with online instruction, delivery of student support in the online and mobile formats, and to aggregate and notify users about events that generate online data. As such, the school needs to perform due-diligence to ascertain that the technology they intend to offer provides essentially the same academic credentials as school educators.&lt;ref name="Neville"/&gt;

For instance, while technology is documented to yield academic results at least comparable to those of face-to-face services, schools also need to confirm that use of a service or software complies with existing practices of their faculty. To answer this concern, LSI creates, jointly with the its schools or publishers, a written set of guidelines called "Rules of Engagement" (ROE) that can be modified as needed.&lt;ref name="BCCCTeacherInstructions"/&gt;

The ROE method and its association to specific teaching practices or [[pedagogy|pedagogies]] may be unique to LSI.  LSI also provides operational data and user access so that clients can monitor to make sure the ROE guidelines are followed.

The '''Micro-MBA''' is a learner-driven, outcomes-based entrepreneurial course based on classroom session followed by pro-active mentoring meetings. The programme aims to teach entrepreneurs, mostly in developing countries, fundamental business skills thus they can operate their businesses successfully. The term ''Micro-MBA'' refers to the traditional [[Master of Business Administration|Master of Business Administration (MBA)]] programme. There is no official definition for the term Micro-MBA. The course programme focuses on teaching theory about subjects as money management, stock control, customer handling, and marketing that can be applied in the daily business activities of the business owners.

==Objective==
The main aim of the Micro-MBA programme is to provide small business owners with basic business skills, which they can apply in their daily activities to grow and sustain their businesses. Furthermore, it is supposed to empower them to become self-employed.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cedric Buffler.jpg|thumb|right|Micro-MBA CEO, Cedric Buffler with the founder of the World Economic Forum, Dr Klaus Schwab. The picture was taken at a press conference in Cape Town in June 2007.]] --&gt;

The [[Wikiversity:Micro-MBA project|Trident Institute]] offered the first Micro-MBA programme in 1988 and it was aimed at business owners who had limited access to further education in South Africa. The programme focuses on teaching students basic business skills in class and mentoring sessions after completing the classes at their marketplaces. The main aim of the course has been to enable small business owners to operate their businesses more successfully or to start their own business.
Since its formation more than 160,000 people have successfully completed the Micro-MBA course, which has been offered by some 250 organisations who have had their trainers trained by Trident Institute. Different surveys have shown that between 67% and 81% of former programme students are still successful with their own business or participating in the labour market 18 months after completing the course.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikiversity:Micro-MBA project]]&lt;/ref&gt;  
The programme has become a successful education tool in basic economic development in South Africa and has spread to other African and Asian countries. The course has been described by the [[Financial Times|London Financial Times]] as ''"Brilliantly Simple and Simply Brilliant!"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This course is Brilliantly Simple and Simply Brilliant!|url=http://www.micro-mba.com/|accessdate=7 August 2013|newspaper=London Financial Times|date=August 1991|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021912/http://www.micro-mba.com/|archivedate=27 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The founder and CEO of Trident Institute, [http://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-safm-market-update/cedric-buffler-ceo-micromba Cedric Buffler], won the award for [http://www.schwabfound.org/content/global-selection Outstanding Social Entrepreneur] for 2007 by the [http://www.schwabfound.org/ Schwab Foundation].
The Micro-MBA has not only spread from South Africa to neighbouring African countries (Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, Zambia, Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria) but also to Asia and South America. Characteristic of these markets is that poor people with small businesses do not have access to supportive business theory and knowledge.

==Admission criteria==
Most organizations that offer Micro-MBA are founded or sponsored by [[Nonprofit Organization]]s. Admissions criteria vary. But mostly it is generally required that participants already have an existing business or a business idea that they want to realize after the course. No specific academic qualifications are required. The most important requirements are high motivation levels and the will to apply the learning to their businesses. Interviews are conducted before choosing applicants to guarantee that they take the opportunity serious. Most of the courses are free of charge but this depends on the programme, course design, and the organization.

==Course design and structure==
Micro-MBA is an outcomes-based, learner-driven course. The classroom learning takes about 35 hours to complete and this is followed by a period of mentoring. This varies, depending on the requirements set by the implementing organisation. The duration of the courses varies from three weeks of classes combined with nine months of mentoring training to three months of classes with additional mentoring training. Facilitators are trained by Trident Institute and are typically business owners or trainers employed by community-based organisations. Mentoring and coaching, in terms of visiting students at their marketplace, after the course, ensures the long-term success of the programme. The course materials are simple as e.g. workbooks and calculators. 
The course comprises 8 simple workbooks, which are accessible to persons with a grade 6 level of literacy:
* Market Investigation
* Business calculations on a simple calculator
* Buying
* Costing and Pricing
* Selling
* Money Management
* Stock Control

Workbooks and bookkeeping materials are available in three variants, for Traders, Producers and Service `providers. Facilitators are trained to offer all three options. Only organisations that have had their facilitators certificated by ~Trident institute are permitted to purchase training materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3223">The '''Millennium Mathematics Project''' ('''MMP''') was set up within the [[University of Cambridge]] in [[England]] as a joint project between the Faculties of Mathematics and Education in 1999. The MMP aims to support maths education for pupils of all abilities from ages 5 to 19 and promote the development of mathematical skills and understanding, particularly through enrichment and extension activities beyond the school curriculum, and to enhance the mathematical understanding of the general public. The project is currently{{when|date=December 2013}} directed by [[John D. Barrow|John Barrow]].

The MMP includes a range of complementary programmes:

*The NRICH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrich.maths.org |title=NRICH : Homepage |publisher=Nrich.maths.org |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; website publishes free mathematics education enrichment material for ages 5 to 19. NRICH material focuses on problem-solving, building core mathematical reasoning and strategic thinking skills. In the academic year 2004/5 the website attracted over 1.7 million site visits (more than 49 million hits).
*''[[Plus Magazine]]'' is a free online maths magazine for age 15+ and the general public. In 2004/5, Plus attracted over 1.3 million website visits (more than 31 million hits). The website won the [[Webby Awards|Webby]] award in 2001 for the best Science site on the Internet.
*The Motivate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motivate.maths.org |title=Motivate... |publisher=motivate.maths.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; video-conferencing project links university mathematicians and scientists to primary and secondary schools in areas of the UK from Jersey and Belfast to Glasgow and inner-city London, with international links to Pakistan, South Africa, India and Singapore.

The project has also developed a Hands On Maths Roadshow presenting creative methods of exploring mathematics, and in 2004 took on the running of Simon Singh's Enigma schools workshops, exploring maths through cryptography and codebreaking. Both are taken to primary and secondary schools and public venues such as shopping centres across the UK and Ireland. [[James Grime]] is the Enigma Project Officer and gives talks in schools and to the general public about the history and mathematics of code breaking - including the demonstration of a genuine World War II Enigma Machine.

In November 2005, the MMP won the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for Higher and Further Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/maths-project-wins-queen%E2%80%99s-anniversary-prize Maths project wins Queen’s Anniversary prize], University of Cambridge News, 18 Nov 2005, retrieved 2015-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pansophism''', in older usage often '''pansophy''', is a concept of [[omniscience]], meaning "all-knowing". In some [[monotheism|monotheistic]] belief systems, a [[god]] is referred as the ultimate knowing spirit.  Someone who is ''pansophical'' is someone who claims to have obtained omniscience.

It also has to do more specifically with [[pedagogic]] ideas of universal wisdom (''pansophia''), as it occurred in the educational system of universal knowledge proposed by [[John Amos Comenius]], a Czech educator. "Comenius's second great interest was in furthering the Baconian attempt at the organization of all human knowledge. He became one of the leaders in the '''encyclopædic or pansophic movement''' of the seventeenth century" from the article on Comenius.

==Pansophic principle==
The '''pansophic principle''' is one of the important principles of [[Comenius]]: that everything must be taught to everyone, as a guiding basis for education, something like [[universal education]] ([[Characteristica universalis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Article of Comenius |format=MS Word |place=[[South Korea |KR]] &lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://google.com/search?q=cache:BLQeRR2l3n0J:sheep.kangnam.ac.kr/~kccs/data/Article_of_Comenius.doc+pansophic+College+Via+lucis&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=16&amp;gl=uk --&gt; |publisher=Kangnam |url=http://sheep.kangnam.ac.kr/~kccs/data/Article_of_Comenius.doc |quote=His education system was focused on teaching everything to everyone, since, from the outset, it was intended to educate all men of society to develop their democratic qualifications. In a word, the system of education proposed by Comenius is universal by its very nature: "as he says, it is 'pansophic', it is intended for all men irrespective of social, or economic position, race or nationality. [...]he attempted to unite all kinds of human knowledge in the universal science of his pansophism on a larger or smaller scale. }} &lt;/ref&gt;

''Pansophism'' was a term used generally by Comenius to describe his pedagogical philosophy. His book ''Pansophiae prodromus'' (1639) was published in London with the cooperation of [[Samuel Hartlib]]. It was followed by ''Pansophiae diatyposis''. Pansophy in this sense has been defined as ‘full adult comprehension of the divine order of things’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://users.ox.ac.uk/~tayl0010/lit_baroq.htm | title = Czech Baroque Literature | publisher = Ox | place = [[United Kingdom |UK]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014090519/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~tayl0010/lit_baroq.htm | archivedate = 2007-10-14 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He aimed to set up a Pansophic College, a precursor of later academic institutes&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Literatur | publisher = Deutsche Comenius Gesellschaft | place = [[Germany |DE]] | url = http://www.deutsche-comenius-gesellschaft.de/literatur_9.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120729152920/http://www.deutsche-comenius-gesellschaft.de/literatur_9.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-07-29 | quote = If he did not succeed in securing the establishment of the international center, or Pansophic College, for the coordination of the knowledge and sciences of the world, he did participate in, and probably contributed to, the discussions which ultimately resulted in the founding of the [[Royal Society]]. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his ideas for this in a tract ''Via lucis'', written 1641/2 in London; he had to leave because the [[English Civil War]] was breaking out, and this work was eventually printed in 1668, in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A biographical time chart | publisher = Deutsche Comenius Gesellschaft | place = [[Germany |DE]] | url = http://www.deutsche-comenius-gesellschaft.de/comenius_2.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120804013315/http://www.deutsche-comenius-gesellschaft.de/comenius_2.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-08-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was not original, having been applied by [[Bartolomeo Barbaro]] of [[Padua]] in his ''De omni scibili libri quadraginta: seu Prodromus pansophiae'', from the middle of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://people.ku.edu/~percival/GramSanct.html | title = On the Historical Source of Sanctian Linguistics | publisher = KU | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050419030358/http://people.ku.edu/~percival/GramSanct.html | archivedate = 2005-04-19 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Peeters directive''' ({{lang-nl|Omzendbrief-Peeters}}, {{lang-fr|Circulaire Peeters}}), officially '''Circular BA 97/22 of 16 December 1997 concerning the use of languages in municipal councils of the Dutch language area''',&lt;ref name="PD"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://binnenland.vlaanderen.be/regelgeving/omzendbrieven/omz16.12.1997.htm |title=Omzendbrief BA 97/22 van 16 december 1997 betreffende het taalgebruik in gemeentebesturen van het Nederlandse taalgebied |author= |work=Regelgeving — Omzendbrieven |page= |year=1997 |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a ''[[circulaire]]'' of the [[Flemish government]] regulating the use of languages in [[municipal council]]s in the [[Flemish Region]] ([[Belgium]]), where the sole official language is [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. The directive is more in particular aimed at the [[municipalities with language facilities]] bordering the [[Brussels Capital-Region]]. It stipulates that each and every time French-speakers deal with the government, they must explicitly ask for their documents to be in French.&lt;ref name="restrictief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ECMI"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzWw5N9uIIEC |title=Personality versus Territoriality: Belgium and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities |author=Wilfried Swenden |work=European Yearbook of Minority Issues: 2002-2003 |pages=331–356 |year=2002–2003 |publisher=[[European Centre for Minority Issues]] |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zakboekje"&gt;{{cite book |language=Dutch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RnmCGe53oJMC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq |title=Statutenzakboekje overheidspersoneel 2007 |author=Wolters Kluwer Belgium NV |work= |page=37 |year=2007 |publisher=[[Kluwer]] |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to art. 7 of the 1966 law on the use of languages in the administration, the six municipalities situated in the Brussels periphery, namely [[Drogenbos]], [[Kraainem]], [[Linkebeek]], [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]], [[Wemmel]] and [[Wezembeek-Oppem]], enjoy a "special treatment" and are called "rim municipalities".

==Legal background==
According to a 1986 ruling of the [[Constitutional Court of Belgium|Constitutional Court]], the division in language regions entails "a restriction on the ability of legislators to regulate the use of languages and so forms the constitutional guarantee of the priority of the language of the unilingual area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/rechtspraak/gwhof1986_017n.pdf |title=Ruling no. 17 of 26 March 1986: In zake : het beroep tot vernietiging van het decreet van de Franse Gemeenschap van 26 juni 1984 "assurant la protection de l'usage de la langue française pour les mandataires publics d'expression française" (tot verzekering van de bescherming van het Franse taalgebruik voor de franstalige overheidsmandatarissen), ingesteld door de Vlaamse Executieve op 12 oktober 1984 |page=11 |date=1984-03-26 |publisher=Constitutional Court of Belgium |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;br&gt;"''Artikel 3bis van de Grondwet behelst tevens een beperking van de bevoegdheid van de wetgevers inzake taalgebruik en vormt aldus de grondwettelijke waarborg van de voorrang van de taal van het eentalige gebied of van het tweetalige karakter van het gebied.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The 1988 revision of the constitution (art. 129, §1) confirms that the parliaments of the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[Flemish Community]] determine through [[Decree (Belgium)|decrees]], each for their respective territory, the use of languages in administrative matters, the education system, for social contacts between the employer and his employees, and for official documents in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www.senate.be/doc/const_fr.html#art129 |title=Article 129 of the Belgian Constitution |date=2009-03-04 |publisher=[[Senate of Belgium]] |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;br&gt;"''Art. 129 (modification de la terminologie): § 1er.

===Underlying ideas===
The Peeters directive's recommendations for [[municipalities with language facilities]] bordering the [[Brussels Capital-Region]] and the [[language border]], where to some extent the French-speaking population has the right to relate with the local and federal administration in [[French language|French]], have triggered political commotion. It stipulates these facilities, being "an exception to the rule of unilingualism of the official language areas", should be interpreted "strictly",&lt;ref&gt;"''De faciliteiten vormen de uitzondering op de eentaligheid van een taalgebied; bijgevolg moeten zij strikt geïnterpreteerd worden.''"&lt;/ref&gt; considering their "exceptional" and "temporary" character.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

{{cquote|The language facilities constitute the exception on the unilingualism of a language area; consequently, they thus have to be interpreted strictly. This implies that this interpretation has to be in conformity with the Constitution at all times. Therefore, the facilities cannot be interpreted that broadly that they would detract the priority of the language of the region and lead to a generalised bilingualism of administration in the municipalities with language facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://binnenland.vlaanderen.be/regelgeving/omzendbrieven/omz16.12.1997.htm |title=Omzendbrief BA 97/22 van 16 december 1997 betreffende het taalgebruik in gemeentebesturen van het Nederlandse taalgebied |author= |work=Regelgeving — Omzendbrieven |page= |year=1997 |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;br&gt;Section I.1.: "''De faciliteiten vormen de uitzondering op de eentaligheid van een taalgebied; bijgevolg moeten zij strikt geïnterpreteerd worden. Dit impliceert dat deze interpretatie in ieder geval conform de Grondwet moet zijn. De faciliteiten mogen dan ook niet dermate ruim geïnterpreteerd worden dat zij afbreuk doen aan de voorrang van de taal van het gebied en dat zij tot een veralgemeende tweetaligheid van het bestuur in de faciliteitengemeenten zouden leiden."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The directive argues language facilities have an "integrative function", meaning that, "per definition", "for the concerned individual", they have an "extinguishing character".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://binnenland.vlaanderen.be/regelgeving/omzendbrieven/omz16.12.1997.htm |title=Omzendbrief BA 97/22 van 16 december 1997 betreffende het taalgebruik in gemeentebesturen van het Nederlandse taalgebied |author= |work=Regelgeving — Omzendbrieven |page= |year=1997 |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;br&gt;Section I.3.: "''De faciliteiten zijn bedoeld als integratiebevorderende maatregel; dit houdt in dat zij per definitie, voor de individuele betrokkenen, een uitdovend karakter hebben. (...)''"&lt;/ref&gt; It reads further: "The interpretation of language facilities has to take into account the possibility that a French-speaking inhabitant, who previously made use of these facilities, meanwhile knows the language of the region well enough and consequently no longer wishes to invoke the facilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://binnenland.vlaanderen.be/regelgeving/omzendbrieven/omz16.12.1997.htm |title=Omzendbrief BA 97/22 van 16 december 1997 betreffende het taalgebruik in gemeentebesturen van het Nederlandse taalgebied |author= |work=Regelgeving — Omzendbrieven |page= |year=1997 |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;br&gt;Section I.3.: "'' (...) Bij de interpretatie van de faciliteiten moet rekening gehouden worden met de mogelijkheid dat een Franstalige inwoner, die voorheen een beroep heeft gedaan op deze faciliteiten, inmiddels de taal van het gebied voldoende kent en bijgevolg zich niet meer op de faciliteiten wenst te beroepen.''"&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, facilities are temporary in character, and because they are temporary, they have to be applied "restrictively", implying that French-speakers have to make a new request each and every time they wish to use French in official affairs.&lt;ref name="restrictief"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://binnenland.vlaanderen.be/regelgeving/omzendbrieven/omz16.12.1997.htm |title=Omzendbrief BA 97/22 van 16 december 1997 betreffende het taalgebruik in gemeentebesturen van het Nederlandse taalgebied |author= |work=Regelgeving — Omzendbrieven |page= |year=1997 |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;br&gt; "''De faciliteiten die de S.W.T. verleent, moeten echter restrictief worden toegepast, hetgeen impliceert dat de particulier telkens uitdrukkelijk moet verzoeken om het Frans te gebruiken. Uiteindelijk werden de faciliteiten ingesteld om de integratie van Franstaligen in het Nederlandse taalgebied te bevorderen.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt; The directive claims the "spirit in which the language laws of 1962-63 were established" is reflected in the end report of the Harmel Centre:&lt;ref&gt;"Harmel Centre" is the nickname for the ''Centre de recherche pour la solution nationale des problèmes sociaux, politiques et juridiques des diverses régions du pays'' (in French) or ''Centrum van onderzoek voor de nationale oplossing van de maatschappelijke, Politieke en Rechtskundige vraagstukken van de verschillende gewesten van het land'' (in Dutch) — both meaning "Centre for research on a national solution for the social, political and juridical problems of the diverse regions of the country" —; it was an advisory body for the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]] and is widely considered to have a had a considerable impact on post-war Belgian politics.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The Walloon community and the Flemish community have to be	homogeneous. The Flemings who settle in Wallonia and the Walloons who settle in Flanders have to be absorbed by the environment. The personal element is thus sacrificed to the advantage of the territorial element. Therefore, the cultural system has to be French in Wallonia and Flemish in Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=French, Dutch |url=http://www3.dekamer.be/digidoc/DPS/K3162/K31621865/K31621865.PDF |title=Final Report of the Centre for research on a national solution for the social, political and juridical problems of the diverse regions of the country |author=Harmel Centre |work=Documenten van de Kamer van Volksvertegenwoordigers, werkjaar 1957–1958, stuk 940 |page=310 |date=1958-04-25 |publisher=[[Belgian Chamber of Representatives|Chamber of Representatives]] |accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;br&gt;"''De Waalse gemeenschap en de Vlaamse gemeenschap moeten gaaf zijn.

Aldus wordt het personeelselement ten voordele van het territoriaal element opgeofferd. Dus moet het cultureel stelsel Frans zijn in Wallonië en Vlaams in Vlaanderen.''"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the directive, this quote clearly shows that the language facilities were intended to ease the transition of the minority language inhabitants to the Community to which their municipality would belong from that moment onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://binnenland.vlaanderen.be/regelgeving/omzendbrieven/omz16.12.1997.htm |title=Omzendbrief BA 97/22 van 16 december 1997 betreffende het taalgebruik in gemeentebesturen van het Nederlandse taalgebied |author= |work=Regelgeving — Omzendbrieven |page= |year=1997 |publisher=[[Flemish government]] |accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;br&gt;Section I.3.: "''Dit citaat geeft duidelijk de geest weer waarin de taalwetten van '62 en '63 tot stand zijn gekomen. De parlementaire debatten die gevoerd werden bij de totstandkoming van de wetten van 8 november 1962 en 2 augustus 1963 tonen aan dat de faciliteiten bedoeld waren om voor anderstaligen de overgang te vergemakkelijken naar de Gemeenschap waartoe de gemeente waarin ze woonden voortaan zou behoren.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tangible changes of the existing practice===
The most important rule introduced by the Peeters directive is that all official documents have to be sent to the citizens in Dutch. Afterwards, French-speakers can request a French translation for each separate document, on their own initiative. As for the application of documents in the town hall, all these documents have to be issued in Dutch in the municipalities along the language border, after which a translation can be requested. For the "rim municipalities" (those bordering Brussels), a French translation can be requested beforehand.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt; Such a restrictive meaning went against the existing practice, whereby citizens had to declare their preferred language only once.&lt;ref name="ECMI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perception"/&gt;

Another issue is that the Peeters directive stipulates that the language of administration and local public services should at all times be Dutch, the only official language of the concerned municipalities. It is obligatory to speak Dutch in meetings of the municipal council and the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt;

==Legal challenge and controversy==

===On the internal language of administration===
On the initiative of the municipality of [[Linkebeek]], the Constitutional Court of Belgium was asked for an opinion on the constitutionality of article 23 of the law of 18 July 1966 that stipulates that the internal language of administration in the rim municipalities has to be Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juridat.be/cgi_loi/loi_N.pl?cn=1966071831 Juridat.be] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212031012/http://www.juridat.be/cgi_loi/loi_N.pl?cn=1966071831 |date=12 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its ruling 98/26 of 10 March 1998, the Court ruled this was not in violation with articles 10 and 11 of the [[Constitution of Belgium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.arbitrage.be/public/n/1998/1998-026n.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031217105401/http://www.arbitrage.be/public/n/1998/1998-026n.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-12-17 |title=Ruling 98/26 of 10 March 1998 |author=Court of Arbitration (present-day Constitutional Court of Belgium) |date=1998-03-10 |publisher=Constitutional Court of Belgium |accessdate=2009-01-22 }}&lt;br&gt;Section B.4.6.: "''Artikel 23 van de bij koninklijk besluit van 18 juli 1966 gecoördineerde wetten op het gebruik van de talen in bestuurszaken schendt niet de artikelen 10 en 11 van de Grondwet, in de interpretatie dat het de burgemeester of een ander lid van het college van burgemeester en schepenen van een in die bepaling beoogde gemeente verbiedt een agendapunt van de gemeenteraadszitting in te leiden of toe te lichten in een andere taal dan het Nederlands of in een dergelijke taal te antwoorden op interventies van gemeenteraadsleden.''"&lt;/ref&gt; and that the mayor and [[schepen|aldermen]] do indeed not have the right to speak in another language than Dutch during council meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.arbitrage.be/public/n/1998/1998-026n.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031217105401/http://www.arbitrage.be/public/n/1998/1998-026n.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-12-17 |title=Ruling 98/26 of 10 March 1998 |author=Court of Arbitration (present-day Constitutional Court of Belgium) |date=1998-03-10 |publisher=Constitutional Court of Belgium |accessdate=2009-01-22 }}&lt;br&gt;Section B.3.2.: "''In de interpretatie van het verwijzende rechtscollege volgt uit artikel 23 van de gecoördineerde wetten op het gebruik van de talen in bestuurszaken dat de burgemeester en de andere leden van het college van burgemeester en schepenen van een gemeente bedoeld in die bepaling uitsluitend het Nederlands dienen te gebruiken bij het inleiden of het toelichten van een agendapunt van de gemeenteraadszitting en bij het beantwoorden van interventies van gemeenteraadsleden. Doen zij zulks niet, dan stellen zij zich bloot aan tuchtsancties (...)''"&lt;/ref&gt; The Court further specified that the language facilities do not alter the principle of Dutch unilingualism of the concerned municipalities and that the Constitution guarantees the primacy of Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.arbitrage.be/public/n/1998/1998-026n.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031217105401/http://www.arbitrage.be/public/n/1998/1998-026n.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-12-17 |title=Ruling 98/26 of 10 March 1998 |author=Court of Arbitration (present-day Constitutional Court of Belgium) |date=1998-03-10 |publisher=Constitutional Court of Belgium |accessdate=2009-01-22 }}&lt;br&gt;Section B.4.1.: "''Hoewel de gecoördineerde wetten op het gebruik van de talen in bestuurszaken ten behoeve van Franstalige inwoners in de randgemeenten in een bijzondere regeling voorzien die hen toestaat hun betrekkingen met de plaatselijke diensten in het Frans te voeren en die aan die diensten de verplichting opleggen om in bepaalde in die wetten nader omschreven omstandigheden het Frans te gebruiken, doet die regeling geen afbreuk aan het principieel eentalig karakter van het Nederlandse taalgebied, waartoe die gemeenten behoren. Zulks impliceert dat de taal die er in bestuurszaken moet worden gebruikt in beginsel het Nederlands is en dat bepalingen die het gebruik van een andere taal toestaan niet tot gevolg mogen hebben dat afbreuk wordt gedaan aan de door artikel 4 van de Grondwet gewaarborgde voorrang van het Nederlands.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the annulment of the circular===
On 27 February 1998, the [[French Community of Belgium]] and the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]], together with a French-speaking inhabitant of one of the concerned rim municipalities, challenged the legitimacy of the directive before the [[Council of State (Belgium)|Council of State]]. On 27 March 2001, the court argued that two first plaintiffs did not have any powers within the territory of the [[Flemish Region]], and dismissed the appeal on those grounds. The case of the French-speaking inhabitant was forwarded to a Dutch-speaking chamber (since the other two plaintiffs were removed from the case, the competetent chamber changed) and debates were reopened.&lt;ref name="eerstearrest"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.raadvst-consetat.be/Arresten/94000/300/94345nfn.pdf |title=Ruling 94.345 of 27 March 2001 |author=Council of State — Department of Administration |date=2001-03-27 |publisher=Council of State |accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;br&gt;More in particular sections 3.2.3.3, 3.2.3.5 and 3.2.4 (conclusion).&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February 1998, the municipality of [[Kraainem]] (in the periphery of Brussels, with a French-speaking majority) had initiated another case, also requesting annulment of the directive.

De verzoekende partij noemt de Commissie immers ten onrechte "het enige administratieve orgaan dat bevoegd is om de wetgeving betreffende het taalgebruik in administratieve zaken te interpreteren" : zij dicht aldus de Commissie een bevoegdheid tot authentieke interpretatie van de wetten toe en gaat daarmee voorbij aan artikel 84 van de Grondwet, luidens welke bepaling alleen de wet een authentieke uitlegging van de wetten mag geven.

The municipal councils of [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]], [[Linkebeek]], [[Wezembeek-Oppem]] and [[Kraainem]] sent out convocation letters for the [[Belgian provincial and municipal elections, 2006|2006 provincial and municipal elections]] in French to the citizens of which they assumed were French-speaking.&lt;ref name="keulenknack"&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/keulen-benoemt-burgemeesters-niet/site72-section24-article9751.html |title=Keulen benoemt burgemeesters niet |author= |date=2007-11-14 |publisher=[[Knack (magazine)|Knack]] |accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was contrary to the Peeters directive ordering municipalities to send out documents in Dutch first, after which a French translation can be requested&lt;ref name="PD"/&gt; and the Keulen directive, prohibiting the stocking of language preference.&lt;ref name="keulen"/&gt; In Flanders (contrary to Wallonia), mayors are not directly elected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3090">'''Playware''' is [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] that aims at producing play and playful experiences among its users.

Examples of playware products are numerous with computer games as the most widespread and successful, but it is a fast-growing industry utilizing pervasive and ambient technology to create new kinds of play equipment and toys, which can be labelled “playware”. 

The term ''playware'' was coined by Carsten Jessen, Associate Professor at the [[Technical University of Denmark]] and the Danish School of Education, [[Aarhus University]], and Henrik Hautop Lund, a professor at the [[Technical University of Denmark]]. They first defined the term in their paper "Playware – Intelligent technology for children’s play" to describe both a new area of research and a product type.

Jessen and Lund argue that the playware is not so much the result of the appearance of digital technology as it is the result of many children (and adults) in modern society not having the necessary knowledge and skills needed to initiate games and play. Earlier generations of children inherited games and learned play skills from older peers when participating in cross-age activities, for instance on the street or in the backyard. This is not to the same extent the case today and according to Jessen and Lund this has led to the need for inspiration from playware. 

Several international playware workshops and symposiums were given and held amongst leading playware and human-robot interaction researchers, such as the keynote talk on modular playware at the 18th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, and the Playware Summit in Copenhagen 2010, where amongst others Y. Sankai, H. Ishiguro, C. Breazeal, T. Fukuda, T. Shibata, K. Dautenhahn, P. Marti, N. Pares, L. Pagliarini, H. Hautop Lund gathered to set a new research agenda for future research and development in playware ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW_pravGQeo/]).

'''Residency''' or '''postgraduate training''' is a stage of graduate [[medical education]]. It refers to a qualified physician, [[podiatrist]], or [[dentist]] (one who holds the degree of [[Doctor of medicine|MD]], [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine|DPM]], [[Doctor of Dental Surgery|DDS]], [[Doctor of Dental Medicine|DMD]], [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] or [[Bachelor of Medicine|MB; BS, MBChB, or BMed]], [[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS]],
[[Bachelor of Dentistry|BDent]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/about/legislation/medical_act.asp#2|title=Our role and the Medical Act 1983|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/education-careers/becoming-physician/frequently-asked-questions.page?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ada.org/en/education-careers/dental-student-resources/career-options-after-dental-school/understanding-advanced-dental-education/program-options-and-descriptions|title=Advance Education Program Options and Descriptions|website=www.ada.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bda.org/students/careers-education/spheres/hospital-dentistry|title=Hospital dentistry|website=bda.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/physician|title=Definition of PHYSICIAN|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who practises [[medicine]], usually in a hospital or clinic, under the direct or indirect supervision of a senior clinician registered in that specialty such as an [[attending physician]] or [[consultant (medicine)|consultant]]. In many jurisdictions, successful completion of such training is a requirement in order to obtain an unrestricted license to practise medicine, and in particular a license to practise a chosen [[specialty (medicine)|specialty]]. An individual engaged in such training may be referred to as a '''resident''', '''house officer''', '''registrar''' or '''trainee''' depending on the jurisdiction. Residency training may be followed by [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] or [[sub-specialty]] training.

Whereas [[medical school]] teaches physicians a broad range of medical knowledge, basic clinical skills, and supervised experience practicing medicine in a variety of fields, medical residency gives in-depth training within a specific branch of medicine.

==Terminology==
A ''resident physician'' is more commonly referred to as a ''resident'', ''senior house officer'' (in Commonwealth countries), or alternatively as a ''senior resident medical officer'' or ''house officer''. Residents have graduated from an accredited medical school and hold a medical degree (MD, DO, MBBS, MBChB). Residents are, collectively, the ''house staff'' of a hospital. This term comes from the fact that resident physicians traditionally spend the majority of their training "in house," i.e., the hospital.  

Duration of residencies can range from three years to seven years, depending upon the program and specialty. A year in residency begins between late June and early July depending on the individual program, and ends one calendar year later. In the United States, the first year of residency is known as an internship with those physicians being termed "interns." Depending on the number of years a specialty requires, the term ''junior resident'' may refer to residents that have not completed half their residency. ''Senior residents'' are residents in their final year of residency, although this can vary. Some residency programs refer to residents in their final year as ''chief residents'' (typically in surgical branches). Alternatively, a ''chief resident'' may describe a resident who has been selected to extend his or her residency by one year and organize the activities and training of the other residents (typically in internal medicine and pediatrics). 

If a physician finishes a residency and decides to further his or her education in a fellowship, he or she is referred to as a "fellow." Physicians who have fully completed their training in a particular field are referred to as ''[[attending physician]]s,'' or ''[[Consultant (medicine)|consultants]]'' (in Commonwealth countries). However, the above nomenclature applies only in educational institutes in which the period of training is specified in advance. In privately owned, non-training hospitals, in certain countries, the above terminology may reflect the level of responsibility held by a physician rather than their level of education.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}

Residency as an opportunity for advanced training in a medical or surgical specialty evolved in the late 19th century from brief and informal programs for extra training in a special area of interest. The first formal residency programs were established by Sir [[William Osler]] and [[William Stewart Halsted]] at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Residencies elsewhere then became formalized and institutionalized for the principal specialties in the early 20th century. But even mid-century, residency was not seen as necessary for general practice and only a minority of primary care physicians participated. By the end of the 20th century in North America though, very few new doctors went directly from medical school into independent, unsupervised medical practice, and more state and provincial governments began requiring one or more years of postgraduate training for [[Medical license|medical licensure]].

Residencies are traditionally hospital-based, and in the middle of the twentieth century, residents would often live (or "reside") in hospital-supplied housing. "Call" (night duty in the hospital) was sometimes as frequent as every second or third night for up to three years. Pay was minimal beyond room, board, and laundry services. It was assumed that most young men and women training as physicians had few obligations outside of medical training at that stage of their careers.

The first year of practical patient-care-oriented training after medical school has long been termed "internship." Even as late as the middle of the twentieth century, most physicians went into primary care practice after a year of internship. Residencies were separate from internship, often served at different hospitals, and only a minority of physicians did residencies.

== Afghanistan ==
In Afghanistan, the residency ([[Dari language|Dari]], ''تخصص'') consists of a three to seven years of practical and research activities in the field selected by the candidate. The graduate medical students do not need to complete the residency because they study medicine in six years (three years for clinical subjects, three years clinical subjects in hospital) and one-year internship and they graduate as general practitioner. Most of students do not complete residency because it is too competitive.

==Argentina==
In Argentina, the residency (Spanish, ''residencia'') consists of a three to four years of practical and research activities in the field selected by both the candidate and already graduated [[Physician|medical practitioners]].  Specialized fields such as neurosurgery or cardio-thoracic surgery require longer training. Through these years, consisting of internships, social services, and occasional research, the resident is classified according to their residency year as an R1, R2, R3 or R4. After the last year, the "R3 or R4 Resident" obtains the specialty (''especialidad'') in the selected field of medicine.

==Australia==
In Australia, specialist training is undertaken as a [[Medical education in Australia#Registrarship / Speciality Training Programs|registrar]]. Entry into a specialist training program occurs after completing 1 year as an intern (post-graduate year 1 or "PGY1"), then at least 1 year as a resident (PGY2 onwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ama.com.au/careers/doctors-training-and-career-advancement|title=Doctors in training and career advancement|date=2018-03-01|work=Australian Medical Association|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training lengths can range from 3 years for general practice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.racgp.org.au/education/registrars/fellowship-pathways/australian-general-practice-training-program-agpt/vocational-training-pathway|title=Royal Australian College of General Practitioners|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 7 years for paediatric surgery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/chw/future-paediatricians/paedsurgeon.php|title=Becoming a Paediatric Surgeon - CHW Clinical School - The University of Sydney|last=Office|first=Publications|website=sydney.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Colombia==
In Colombia, fully licensed physicians are eligible to compete for seats in residency programs. To be fully licensed, one must first finish a medical training program that usually lasts five to six years (varies between universities), followed by one year of medical and surgical internship. During this internship a national medical qualification exam is required, and, in many cases, an additional year of unsupervised medical practice as a social service physician. Applications are made individually program by program, and are followed by a postgraduate medical qualification exam. The scores during medical studies, university of medical training, curriculum vitae, and, in individual cases, recommendations are also evaluated. The acceptance rate into residencies is very low (~1–5% of applicants in public university programs), physician-resident positions do not have salaries, and the tuition fees reach or surpass US$10,000 per year in private universities, and $2,000 in public universities.{{fact|date=May 2018}} For the reasons mentioned above, many physicians travel abroad (mainly to Argentina, Brazil, Spain and the United States) to seek postgraduate medical training. The duration of the programs varies between three and six years. In public universities, and some private universities, it is also required to write and defend a medical thesis before receiving a specialist degree.

==France==
{{See also|Medical school in France#Third cycle of the medical studies}}
In France, students attending clinical practice are known as "externes" and newly qualified practitioners training in hospitals are known as "internes". The residency, called "Internat", lasts from three to six years and follows a competitive national ranking examination. It is customary to delay submission of a thesis. As in most other European countries, many years of practice at a junior level may follow.
French residents are often called "doctor" during their residency. Literally speaking, they are still students and become M.D. only at the end of their residency and after submitting and defending a thesis before a jury.

==Greece==
In Greece, licensed physicians are eligible to apply for a position in a residency program. To be a licensed physician, one must finish a medical training program which in Greece lasts for six years. A one-year obligatory rural medical service (internship) is necessary to complete the residency training.&lt;ref name="dasta.auth.gr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dasta.auth.gr/cmsitem.aspx?sid=2&amp;id=139|title=To obtain medical specialty|website=Resources office Aristotle University of Thessaloniki|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications are made individually in the prefecture where the hospital is located, and the applicants are positioned on first-come, first-served basis.&lt;ref name="dasta.auth.gr"/&gt; The salary of a physician-resident is 10,000 euro per year. The duration of the residency programs varies between three and seven years.

==Mexico==

In Mexico physicians need to take the ENARM (National Test for Aspirants to Medical Residency) (Spanish, ''Examen Nacional de Aspirantes a Residencias Medicas'') in order to have a chance for a medical residency in the field he or she wishes to specialize. The physician is allowed to apply to only one speciality each year. Some 35,000 physicians apply and only 8000 are selected. The selected physicians bring their certificate of approval to the hospital that they wish to apply (Almost all the hospitals for medical residency are from government based institutions). The certificate is valid only once per year and if the resident decides to drop residency and try to enter to a different speciality she will need to take the test one more time (no limit of attempts). All the hosting hospitals are affiliated to a public/private university and this institution is the responsible to give the degree of "specialist". This degree is unique but equivalent to the MD used in the UK and India. In order to graduate, the trainee is required to present a thesis project and defend it.

The length of the residencies is very similar to the American system. The residents are divided per year (R1, R2, R3, etc.). After finishing the trainee may decide if he wants to subspecialize (equivalency to fellowship) and the usual length of sub-specialty training ranges from two to four years. In Mexico the term "fellow" is not used.

The residents are paid by the hosting hospital, about US$1000–$1100 (paid in Mexican pesos). Foreign physicians do not get paid and indeed are required to pay an annual fee of $1000 to the university institution that the hospital is affiliated with. 
All the specialties in Mexico are board certified and some of them have a written and an oral component, making these boards ones of the most competitives in Latin America.

==Pakistan==

In [[Pakistan]], after completing [[MBBS]] degree and further completing one year [[Internship (medicine)|house job]], doctors can enroll in two types of postgraduate residency programs. First is [[Master of Surgery|MS]]/[[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] program run by various medical universities throughout the country. It is a 4–5-year program depending upon the [[specialty (medicine)|specialty]]. Second is fellowship program which is called [[Fellow of College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan]] (FCPS) by the [[College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan]] (CPSP). It is also a 4–5-year program depending upon the [[specialty (medicine)|specialty]].

There are also post-fellowship programs offered by the [[College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan]] as a second fellowship in sub specialties.

==Spain==
All Spanish medical degree holders need to pass a competitive national exam (named 'MIR') in order to access the specialty training program. This exam gives them the opportunity to choose both the specialty and the hospital where they will train, among the hospitals in the Spanish Healthcare Hospital Network. Currently, medical specialties last from 4 to 5 years.

There are plans to change the training program system in a similar way the UK does. There have been some talks between [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Ministry of Health]], the Medical College of Physicians and the Medical Student Association but it is not clear how this change process is going to be.

==Sweden==
===Prerequisites for applying to a specialist training program===

A physician practicing in [[Sweden]] may apply to a specialist training program ({{lang-sv|Specialisttjänstgöring}}) after being licensed as a [[Doctor of Medicine]] by [[National_Board_of_Health_and_Welfare_(Sweden)|The National Board of Health and Welfare]].&lt;ref name="Swe01"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://legitimation.socialstyrelsen.se/en/educated-outside-eu-and-eea/doctor-of-medicine |title=Application for a license in health care |author=Socialstyrelsen |date=23 August 2016 |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain a license through the [[Education_in_Sweden|Swedish education system]] a candidate must go through several steps. First the candidate must successfully finish a five-and-a-half-year [[Undergraduate_education|undergraduate program]], made up of two [[year]]s of pre-clinical studies and three and a half years of clinical postings, at one of [[List_of_medical_schools_in_Europe#Sweden|Sweden's seven medical schools]]—[[Uppsala University]], [[Lund University]], [[Karolinska_Institute|The Karolinska Institute]], [[University_of_Gothenburg|The University of Gothenburg]], [[Umeå University]], or [[Örebro University]]—after which a [[Academic_degree|degree]] of [[Master of Science]] in Medicine ({{lang-sv|Läkarexamen}}) is awarded.&lt;ref name="Swe02"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uu.se/utbildning/utbildningar/selma/program/?pKod=MME2Y |title=Läkarprogrammet 2018/2019 |author=Uppsala universitet |access-date=24 April 2018 |language=Swedish |trans-title=The Medical Program 2018/2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree makes the physician applicable for an [[Internship_(medicine)|internship]] ({{lang-sv|Allmäntjänstgöring}}) ranging between 18–24 [[month]]s, depending on the [[Workplace|place of employment]].

The internship is regulated by the National Board of Health and Welfare and regardless of place of employment it is made up of four main postings with a minimum of nine months divided between [[internal medicine]] and surgery—with no less than three months in each posting—three months in [[psychiatry]], and six months in [[general practice]].&lt;ref name="Swe03"&gt;{{cite book |author=Socialstyrelsen |date=June 2006 |title=Tjänstgöringsbok för AT-läkare |trans-title=Posting Registration Book for Intern Physicians |url=https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/Lists/Artikelkatalog/Attachments/9607/2006-119-1_20061191_omtryck.pdf |language=Swedish |location=Lindesberg, Sweden |publisher=Bergslagens Grafiska AB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is customary for many hospitals to post interns for an equal amount of time in surgery and internal medicine (e.g. six months in each of the two). An intern is expected to care for patients with a certain degree of independence but is under the supervision of more [[Attending_physician|senior physicians]] who may or may not be on location.

During each clinical posting the intern is evaluated by senior colleagues and is, if deemed having [[skill]]s corresponding to the [[goal]]s set forth by The National Board of Health and Welfare, passed individually on all four postings and may go on to take a written exam in multiple-choice format on common [[Case_presentation|case presentations]] in surgery, internal medicine, psychiatry, and general practice.&lt;ref name="Swe03" /&gt;

After passing all four main postings of the internship and the written exam, the physician may apply to The National Board of Health and Welfare to be licensed as a Doctor of Medicine. Upon application the physician has to pay a licensing fee of [[Swedish_krona|SEK]] 2,300&lt;ref name="Swe04"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://legitimation.socialstyrelsen.se/sv/utbildad-i-sverige/lakare/ansok-om-legitimation |title=Ansök om legitimation |trans-title=Apply for a License |language=Swedish |author=Socialstyrelsen |date=29 August 2017 |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—approximately equivalent to [[Euro|EUR]] 220 or [[United_States_dollar|USD]] 270, as per exchange rates on 24 April 2018—out of pocket, as it is not considered to be an expense directly related to [[medical school]] and thus is not covered by the state.

[[International_medical_graduate|Physicians who have a foreign medical degree]] may apply for a license through different paths, depending on whether they are licensed in another [[European_Union|EU]] or [[European_Economic_Area|EEA]] country or not.&lt;ref name="Swe05"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://legitimation.socialstyrelsen.se/en/educated-outside-eu-and-eea/doctor-of-medicine |title=Doctor of Medicine |author=Socialstyrelsen |date=23 August 2016 |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialty Selection===

The Swedish medical specialty system is, as of 2015, made up of three different types of specialties; base specialties, subspecialties, and add-on specialties. Every physician wishing to specialize starts by training in a base specialty and can thereafter go on to train in a subspecialty specific to their base specialty. Add-on specialties also require previous training in a base specialty and/or subspecialty but are less specific in that they, unlike subspecialties, can be entered into through several different previous specialties.&lt;ref name="Swe06"&gt;{{cite act |title=Läkarnas specialiseringstjänstgöring |trans-title=Physicians' Speciality Training |language=Swedish |date=17 February 2015 |url=http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/Lists/Artikelkatalog/Attachments/19743/2015-3-1.pdf |accessdate=24 April 2018 |article=2015-3-1 |issn=0346-6000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the base specialties are grouped into eight [[Class_(set_theory)|classes]]—pediatric specialties, imaging and functional medicine specialties, independent base specialties, internal medicine specialties, surgical specialties, laboratory specialties, neurological specialties, and psychiatric specialties.&lt;ref name="Swe06" /&gt;

It is a requirement that all base specialty training programs are at least five years in length.&lt;ref name="Swe06" /&gt; Common reasons for base specialty training to take longer than five years is paternity or maternity leave and/or simultaneous PhD studies.

===Application process===

There is no centralized selection process for internship or residency positions. The application process is more similar to that of other jobs on the market—i.e. application via cover letter and curriculum vitae. Both types of positions are however usually publicly advertised and many hospitals have nearly synchronous recruitment processes once or twice per year—mainly depending on hospital size—for their internship positions.

====Factors====

Apart from the requirement that candidates are graduates from approved medical programs and, in the case of residency, licensed as medical doctors, there are no specific criteria an employer has to consider in hiring for an internship or residency position. This system for recruiting has been criticized by [[Swedish_Medical_Association|The Swedish Medical Association]] for lacking transparency&lt;ref name="Swe07"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cederberg |first1=Jesper |date=20 March 2017 |title=Sylfs certifiering ska göra AT-rekryteringen schysstare |trans-title=Sylf's Certification Will Make Recruitment of Intern Physicians More Just |language=Swedish |url=http://lakartidningen.se/Aktuellt/Nyheter/2017/03/Sylfs-certifiering-ska-gora-AT-rekryteringen-schysstare/ |journal=Läkartidningen |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for delaying time to specialist certification of physicians&lt;ref name="Swe08"&gt;{{cite report |author=Sveriges yngre läkares förening |date=October 2017 |title=SYLF:s väntetidsrapport 2017 |trans-title=SYLF's Wait Time Report 2017 |language=Swedish |url=https://www.slf.se/upload/SYLF/SYLF.se/Publikationer/AT-ranking/SYLFs-vantetidsrapport-2017.pdf |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There are nevertheless factors that most employers will consider, the most important being how long a doctor has been in active practice.&lt;ref name="Swe08" /&gt; After completing nine out of a total of eleven semesters of medical school a student may work as a physician on a temporary basis—e.g. during [[Summer_vacation|summer breaks]] from university.&lt;ref name="Swe09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/ansokaomlegitimationochintyg/forarbetsgivare/anstallalakareutanlegitimation |title=Anställa läkare utan legitmation |author=Socialstyrelsen |access-date=24 April 2018 |language=Swedish |trans-title=Hiring Physicians without a License}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule enables medical graduates to start working as physicians upon graduating from university without yet being licensed, as a way of building [[experience]] to be able to eventually be hired into an internship. According to a 2017 survey by The Swedish Medical Association, interns in the country as a whole had worked an average of 10.3 months as physicians before starting their internships, ranging from an average of 5.1 months for interns in the [[Dalarna]] region to an average of 19.8 months for interns in the [[Stockholm]] region.&lt;ref name="Swe08" /&gt;

In recruitment for residency positions less emphasis is often placed on the number of months a candidate has worked after finishing their internship, but it is common for physicians to work for some time in between internship and residency, much in the same way as between medical school and internship.

==United Kingdom==

===History===
In the United Kingdom, house officer posts used to be optional for those going into general practice, but almost essential for progress in hospital medicine. The Medical Act of 1956 made satisfactory completion of one year as house officer necessary to progress from provisional to full registration as a medical practitioner. The term "intern" was not used by the medical profession, but the general public were introduced to it by the US television series about "[[Dr Kildare]]." They were usually called " housemen" but the term resident was also used unofficially. However, in some hospitals the "resident medical officer" (RMO) (or "resident surgical officer" etc.) was the most senior of the live-in medical staff of that specialty.

The pre-registration house officer posts lasted six months, and it was necessary to complete one surgical and one medical post. Obstetrics could be substituted for either. In principle, general practice in a "Health Centre" was also allowed, but this was almost unheard of. The posts did not have to be in general medicine: some teaching hospitals had very specialised posts at this level, so it was possible for a new graduate to do [[neurology]] plus [[neurosurgery]] or [[orthopedic surgery|orthopaedics]] plus [[rheumatology]], for one year before having to go onto more broadly based work. The pre-registration posts were nominally supervised by the General Medical Council, which in practice delegated the task to the medical schools, who left it to the consultant medical staff. The educational value of these posts varied enormously.

On call work in the early days was full-time, with frequent night shifts and weekends on call. One night in two was common, and later one night in three. This meant weekends on call started at 9&amp;nbsp;am on Friday and ended at 5&amp;nbsp;pm on Monday (80 hours). Less acute specialties such as dermatology could have juniors permanently on call. The European Union's controversial [[Working Time Directive]]&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald JEF, Caesar B, 2012 399–403"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fitzgerald JE, Caesar BC | title = The European working time directive: A practical review for surgical trainees | journal = International Journal of Surgery | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = 399–403 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22925631 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijsu.2012.08.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conflicted with this: at first the UK negotiated an opt-out for some years, but working hours needed reform. On call time was unpaid until 1975 (the year of the house officers' one-day strike), and for a year or two depended on certification by the consultant in charge – a number of them refused to sign. On call time was at first paid at 30% of the standard rate. Before paid on call was introduced, there would be several house officers "in the house" at any one time and the "second on call" house officer could go out, provided they kept the hospital informed of their telephone number at all times.

A "pre-registration house officer" would go on to work as a "senior house officer" for at least one year before seeking a registrar post. SHO posts could last six months to a year, and junior doctors often had to travel around the country to attend interviews and move house every six months while constructing their own training scheme for general practice or hospital specialisation. Locum posts could be much shorter. Organised schemes were a later development, and do-it-yourself training rotations became rare in the 1990s. Outpatients were not usually a junior house officer's responsibility, but such clinics formed a large part of the workload of more senior trainees, often with little real supervision.

Registrar posts lasted one or two years, and sometimes much longer outside an academic setting. It was common to move from one registrar post to another. Fields such as psychiatry and radiology used to be entered at the registrar stage, but the other registrars would usually have passed part one of a higher qualification, such as a Royal College membership or fellowship before entering that grade. Part two (the complete qualification) was necessary before obtaining a senior registrar post, usually linked to a medical school, but many left hospital practice at this stage rather than wait years to progress to a consultant post.

Most British clinical diplomas (requiring one or two years' experience) and membership or fellowship exams were not tied to particular training grades, though the length of training and nature of experience might be specified. Participation in an approved training scheme was required by some of the royal colleges. The sub-specialty exams in surgery, now for [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons]], were originally limited to senior registrars. These rules prevented many of those in non-training grades from qualifying to progress.

Once a Senior Registrar, depending on specialty, it could take anything from one to six years to go onto a permanent consultant and/or senior lecturer appointment. It might be necessary to obtain an MD or ChM degree and to have substantial published research. Transfer to general practice or a less favoured specialty could be made at any stage along this pathway: [[Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran|Lord Moran]] famously referred to [[general practitioner]]s as those who had "fallen off the ladder."

There are also permanent non-training posts at sub-consultant level: previously senior hospital medical officer and medical assistant (both obsolete) and now staff grade, specialty doctor and associate specialist. The regulations do not call for much experience or any higher qualifications, but in practice both are common, and these grades have high proportions of overseas graduates, ethnic minorities and women.

Research fellows and PhD candidates are often clinical assistants, but a few were senior or specialist registrars. A large number of "Trust Grade" posts have been created by the new NHS trusts for the sake of the routine work, and many juniors have to spend time in these posts before moving between the new training grades, although no educational or training credit is given for them. Holders of these posts may work at various levels, sharing duties with a junior or middle grade practitioner or with a consultant.

===Post 2005===
The structure of medical training was reformed in 2005 when the [[Modernising Medical Careers|Modernising Medical Careers (MMC)]] reform programme was instituted. House officers and the first year of senior house officer jobs were replaced by a compulsory two-year foundation training programme, followed by competitive entry into a formal specialty-based training programme. Registrar and Senior Registrar grades had been merged in 1995/6 as the specialist registrar (SpR) grade (entered after a longer period as a senior house officer, after obtaining a higher qualification, and lasting up to six years), with regular local assessments panels playing a major role. Following MMC these posts were replaced by StRs, who may be in post up to eight years, depending on the field.

The structure of the training programmes vary with specialty but there are five broad categories:
* Themed core specialties (A&amp;E, ITU and anaesthetics)
* Surgical specialties
* Medical specialties
* Psychiatry
* Run-Through Specialties (e.g. General Practice, Clinical Radiology, Pathology, Paediatrics)

The first four categories all run on a similar structure: the Trainee first completes a two-year structured and broad-based core training programme in that field (such as core medical training) which makes them eligibile for competitive entry into an associated specialty training scheme (e.g.  gastroenterology if core medical training has been completed). The Core training years are referred to as CT1 and CT2, and the specialist years are ST3 onwards until completing training. Core training and the first year or two of speciality training are equivalent to the old Senior House Officer jobs.

It is customary for trainees in these areas to sit their Membership examinations (such as the [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|Royal College of Physicians (MRCP)]], or the [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS)]]) in order to progress and compete for designated sub-specialty training programmes that attract a national training number as specialty training year 3 (ST3) and beyond – up to ST 9 depending on the particular training specialty.

In the 5th category, the trainee immediately starts specialty training (ST1 instead of CT1) progressing up to Consultant level without break or further competitive application process (run-through training). Most of the run-through schemes are in stand-alone specialties (such as radiology, public health or histopathology), but there are also a few traditionally surgical specialities which can be entered directly without completing core surgical training – neurosurgery, obstetrics &amp; gynaecology and ophthalmology. The length of this training varies, for example general practice is 3 years while radiology is 5 years.

The UK grade equivalent of a US fellow in medical/surgical sub-specialties is the specialty registrar (ST3–ST9) grade of sub-specialty training, but note that while US fellowship programmes are generally 2–3 years in duration after completing the residency, UK trainees spend 4–7 years. This generally includes service provision in the main specialty; this discrepancy lies in the competing demands of NHS service provision and UK postgraduate training stipulating that even specialist registrars must be able to accommodate the general acute medical take—almost equivalent to what dedicated attending internists perform in the United States (they still remain minimally supervised for these duties).

==United States==
In some states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fsmb.org/licensure/usmle-step-3/state_specific|title=FSMB - State-Specific Requirements For Initial Medical Licensure|website=www.fsmb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the United States, physicians may usually obtain a general [[medical license]] to practice medicine without supervision after completing one year of internship in the state of their license. Many residents have medical licenses and do legally practice medicine without supervision ("moonlight") in settings such as urgent care centers and rural hospitals. However, in most residency-related settings, residents are supervised by [[attending physician]]s who must approve of their decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.staffcare.com/medical-moonlighting-for-residents-pros-and-cons/|title=Medical Moonlighting for Residents: The Pros and Cons|website=www.staffcare.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialty selection===
Different specialties differ in length of training, competitiveness-size, and options. Programs range from three years for family medicine to 7 years for neurosurgery.&lt;ref&gt;http://residency.wustl.edu/Choosing/SpecDesc/Pages/Neurosurgery.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This time is not including a potential [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] which can be completed after residency to further sub-specialize. In 2015 there were almost 7000 positions for internal medicine compared to around 400 positions for dermatology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://residency.wustl.edu/Choosing/SpecDesc/Pages/Dermatology.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018230120/http://residency.wustl.edu/Choosing/SpecDesc/Pages/Dermatology.aspx |archive-date=18 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in regards to options, specialties can range from having over 400 training programs nationally (internal medicine) to just 26 programs for integrated thoracic surgery.

===Application process===

====Factors====
There are many factors that can go into what makes an applicant more or less competitive. According to a survey of residency program directors by the NRMP in 2012, the following three factors were mentioned by directors over 71% of the time as having the most impact:
* Step 1 score (82%)
* Letters of recommendation in specialty (81%)
* Personal statement (77%)

Between 50% and 71% also mentioned other factors such as core clerkship grades/ Step 2 score/ specialty clerkship grades/ allopathic medical school attendance/ MSPE-dean's letter.&lt;ref name="nrmp.org"&gt;http://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/programresultsbyspecialty2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These factors often come as a surprise to many students in the preclinical years, who often work very hard to get great grades, but do not realize that only 45% of directors cite basic science performance as an important measure.&lt;ref name="nrmp.org"/&gt;

====Written====
Applicants begin the application process with ERAS (regardless of their matching program) at the beginning of their fourth and final year in medical school.

At this point, students choose specific residency programs to apply for that often specifies both specialty and hospital system, sometimes even subtracks (e.g. Internal Medicine Residency Categorical Program at Mass General or San Francisco General Primary Care Track).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medicine.ucsf.edu/education/residency/|title=UCSF - Department of Medicine - Residency Programs - Residency Programs|website=medicine.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massgeneral.org/medicine/education/residency.aspx?id=47|title=Internal Medicine Residency Program - Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA|website=www.massgeneral.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After they apply to programs, programs review applications and invite selected candidates for interviews held between October and February. As of 2016, schools can view applications starting 1 Oct.&lt;ref&gt;https://students-residents.aamc.org/attending-medical-school/how-apply-residency-positions/applying-residencies-eras/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interviews====
The interview process involves separate interviews at hospitals around the country. Frequently, the individual applicant pays for travel and lodging expenses, but some programs may subsidize applicants' expenses. Generally, an interview begins with a dinner the night before in a relaxed, "meet-and-greet" setting with current residents and/or staff. Formal interviews with attendings and senior residents are then held the next day, and the applicant tours the program's facilities.

Interview questions are primarily related to the applicant's interest in the program and specialty. The purpose of these tasks is to force an applicant into a pressured setting and less to test his or her specific skills.

To defray the cost of residency interviews, social networking sites have been devised to allow applicants with common interview dates to share travel expenses. Nonetheless, additional loans are often required for "residency and relocation".

[[international medical graduate|International medical students]] may participate in a residency program within the United States as well but only after completing a program&lt;!-- not sure of this word, there was one missing here prior --&gt; set forth by the [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]] (ECFMG). Through its program of certification, the ECFMG assesses the readiness of international medical graduates to enter residency or fellowship programs in the United States that are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). The ECFMG does not have jurisdiction over Canadian M.D. programs, which the relevant authorities consider to be fully equivalent to U.S. medical schools. In turn, this means that Canadian M.D. graduates, if they can obtain the required visas (or are already U.S. citizens or permanent residents), can participate in U.S. residency programs on the same footing as U.S. graduates.

{{Main|National Resident Matching Program}}
{{See also|Comparison of MD and DO in the United States#Residency Training}}
{{See also|Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges}}

=====Ranking=====
Access to graduate medical training programs such as residencies is a competitive process known as "the Match." After the interview period is over, students submit a "rank-order list" to a centralized matching service that depends on the residency program they are applying for:

* most specialties – currently{{When|date=September 2014}} the [[National Resident Matching Program]], abbreviated NRMP) by February
* Urology Residency Match Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.auanet.org/education/urology-and-specialty-matches.cfm|title=American Urological Association - Urology and Specialty Matches|website=www.auanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* SF Match (Ophth/ Plastics)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfmatch.org/Specialty.aspx|title=Residency and Fellowship Match|website=www.sfmatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* American Osteopathic Association Match&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/Education/students/match-program/Pages/match-results.aspx|title=2018 AOA Match Results|website=www.osteopathic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, residency programs submit a list of their preferred applicants in rank order to this same service. The process is blinded, so neither applicant nor program will see each other's list. Aggregate program rankings can be found here, and are tabulated in real time based on applicants' anonymously submitted rank lists.

The two parties' lists are combined by an NRMP computer, which creates stable (a proxy for optimal) matches of residents to programs using an [[Stable marriage problem|algorithm]]. On the third Friday of March each year ("[[Match Day (medicine)|Match Day]]") these results are announced in Match Day ceremonies at the nation's 155 U.S. medical schools. By entering the Match system, applicants are contractually obligated to go to the residency program at the institution to which they were matched.  The same applies to the programs; they are obligated to take the applicants who matched into them.

=====Match Day=====
On the Monday of the week that contains the third Friday in March, candidates find out from the NRMP whether (but not where) they matched. If they have matched, they must wait until Match Day, which takes place on the following Friday, to find out where. In 2019, Match Day will be March 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nrmp.org/residency/main-match-events/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929004259/http://www.nrmp.org/residency/main-match-events/ |archive-date=29 September 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====SOAP=====
Informally called the scramble, the Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program (SOAP) is process for applicants that did not secure a position through the Match, the locations of remaining unfilled residency positions are released to unmatched applicants the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrmp.org/residency/soap/|title=SOAP for Applicants Video - The Match, National Resident Matching Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These applicants are given the opportunity to contact the programs about the open positions. This frantic, loosely structured system forces soon-to-be medical school graduates to choose programs not on their original Match list. In 2012, the NRMP introduced an "organized scramble" system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrmp.org/|title=NRMP TO IMPLEMENT MATCH WEEK CHANGES|accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2014}} As part of the transition, Match Day was also moved from the third Thursday in March to the third Friday.

=====Changing Residency=====
Inevitably, there will be discrepancies between the preferences of the student and programs. Students may be matched to programs very low on their rank list, especially when the highest priorities consist of competitive specialties like [[radiology]], [[neurosurgery]], [[plastic surgery]], [[dermatology]], [[ophthalmology]], [[orthopedics]], [[otolaryngology]], [[radiation oncology]], and [[urology]]. It is not unheard of for a student to go even a year or two in a residency then switching to a new program.

A similar but separate osteopathic match exists which announces its results in February, before the NRMP. [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Osteopathic physicians]] ([[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]]s) may participate in either match, filling either M.D. positions (traditionally obtained by physicians with the [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree or international equivalent including the [[MBBS|MBBS or MBChB degree]]) accredited by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME), or DO positions accredited by the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA).

Military residencies are filled in a similar manner as the NRMP however at a much earlier date (usually mid-December) to allow for students who did not match to proceed to the civilian system.

In 2000–2004 the matching process was attacked as [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive]] by resident physicians represented by [[class-action]] lawyers. ''See, e.g., [[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges]] et al.,'' [[Case citation|300 F.Supp.2d 119]] ([[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|DDC]] 2004).  Congress reacted by carving out a specific exception in [[antitrust]] law for medical residency. ''See'' [[Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004]] § 207, Pub. L. No. 108-218, 118 Stat. 596 (2004) (codified at {{UnitedStatesCode|15|37b}}). The lawsuit was later dismissed under the authority of the new act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/14/us/antitrust-lawsuit-over-medical-residency-system-is-dismissed.html |first=S. |last=Robinson |title=Antitrust Lawsuit Over Medical Residency System Is Dismissed |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=14 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The matching process itself has also been scrutinized as limiting the employment rights of medical residents, namely where upon acceptance of a match, medical residents pursuant to the matching rules and regulations, are required to accept any and all terms and conditions of employment imposed by the health care facility, institution or hospital.&lt;ref name="Robert N. Wilkey pg. 705"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkey|first=Robert N.|title=The Non-Negotiable Employment Contract: Diagnosing the Employment Rights of Medical Residents|journal=Creighton Law Review|date=April 2011|page=705|volume=44|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=44+Creighton+L.+Rev.+705&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=502ed991cce7e63ca2636692e6e58e0f|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE Step 1]] or [[Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination|COMLEX Level 1]] score is just one of many factors considered by residency programs in selecting applicants. Although it varies from specialty to specialty, [[Alpha Omega Alpha]] membership, clinical clerkship grades, letters of recommendation, class rank, research experience, and school of graduation are all considered when selecting future residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrmp.org/data/programresultsbyspecialty2010v3.pdf|title=Results of the 2010 NRMP Program Director Survey|accessdate=2011-04-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721091632/http://www.nrmp.org/data/programresultsbyspecialty2010v3.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of long hours===
''See main article on [[Medical resident work hours]]''

Medical residencies traditionally require lengthy hours of their trainees. Early residents literally resided at the hospitals, often working in unpaid positions during their education. During this time, a resident might always be "on call" or share that duty with just one other practitioner. More recently, 36-hour shifts were separated by 12 hours of rest, during 100+ hour weeks.  The American public, and the medical education establishment, recognized that such long hours were counter-productive, since [[sleep deprivation]] increases rates of [[medical error]]s.  This was noted in a landmark study on the effects of sleep deprivation and error rate in an [[Intensive-care unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Landrigan}}{{cite journal |vauthors=Landrigan CP, Rothschild JM, Cronin JW, Kaushal R, Burdick E, Katz JT, Lilly CM, Stone PH, Lockley SW, Bates DW, Czeisler CA | title = Effect of reducing interns' work hours on serious medical errors in intensive care units | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 351 | issue = 18 | pages = 1838–48 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15509817 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa041406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Drazen JM | title = Awake and informed | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 351 | issue = 18 | page = 1884 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15509822 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMe048276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly (averaged over 4 weeks), overnight call frequency to no more than one overnight every third day, and 10 hours off between shifts. Still, a review committee may grant exceptions for up to 10%, or a maximum of 88 hours, to individual programs. Until early 2017, duty periods for postgraduate year 1 could not exceed 16 hours per day, while postgraduate year 2 residents and in those in subsequent years can have duty periods up to a maximum of 24 hours of continuous duty. After early 2017, all years of residents may work up to 24-hour shifts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/730579?src=mp&amp;spon=25&amp;uac=149266AJ New ACGME Standards for Resident Duty Become Effective July 2011] Article written by Laurie Barclay, 14 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for the purposes of accreditation, though lack of adherence to hour restrictions is not uncommon.

Most recently, the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) built upon the recommendations of the ACGME in the December 2008 report ''Resident Duty Hours: Enhancing Sleep, Supervision and Safety''. While keeping the ACGME's recommendations of an 80-hour work week averaged over 4 weeks, the IOM report recommends that duty hours should not exceed 16 hours per shift, unless an uninterrupted five-hour break for sleep is provided within shifts that last up to 30 hours. The report also suggests residents be given variable off-duty periods between shifts, based on the timing and duration of the shift, to allow residents to catch up on sleep each day and make up for chronic sleep deprivation on days off.

Critics of long residency hours trace the problem to the fact that a resident has no alternatives to positions that are offered, meaning residents must accept all conditions of employment, including very long work hours, and that they must also, in many cases, contend with poor supervision. This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours.&lt;ref name="Robert N. Wilkey pg. 705"/&gt;

Supporters of traditional work hours contend that much may be learned in the hospital during the extended time. Some argue that it remains unclear whether patient safety is enhanced or harmed by a reduction in work hours which necessarily lead to more transitions in care. Some of the clinical work traditionally performed by residents has been shifted to other healthcare workers such as ward clerks, nurses, laboratory personnel, and [[phlebotomists]]. It has also resulted in a shift of some resident work towards home work, where residents will complete paperwork and other duties at home as to not have to log the hours.

===Adoption of working time restrictions===
United States federal law places no limit on resident work hours.  Regulatory and legislative attempts at limiting resident work hours have been proposed, but have yet to be passed.  Class action litigation on behalf of the 200,000 medical residents in the US has been another route taken to resolve the matter.

Dr. Richard Corlin, president of the [[American Medical Association]], has called for re-evaluation of the training process, declaring "We need to take a look again at the issue of why the resident is there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gupta |first=Sanjay |title=AMA expected to take up resident work hours |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |accessdate=28 August 2012 |newspaper=CNN |date=15 June 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527031017/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |archivedate=27 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2002, an 80-hour work limit went into effect in residencies accredited by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). The decision also mandates that interns and residents in AOA-approved programs may not work in excess of 24 consecutive hours exclusive of morning and noon educational programs. It does allow up to six hours for inpatient and outpatient continuity and transfer of care. However, interns and residents may not assume responsibility for a new patient after 24 hours.

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) rejected a petition filed by the [[Committee of Interns &amp; Residents]]/SEIU, a national union of medical residents, the [[American Medical Student Association]], and [[Public Citizen]] that sought to restrict medical resident work hours. OSHA instead opted to rely on standards adopted by ACGME, a private trade association that represents and accredits residency programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medical Residents' Work Hours|url=http://www.citizen.org/hrg/article_redirect.cfm?ID=6666|publisher=Public Citizen|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 2003, the ACGME instituted standards for all accredited residency programs, limiting the work week to 80 hours a week averaged over a period of four weeks.  These standards have been voluntarily adopted by residency programs.

Though re-accreditation may be negatively impacted and accreditation suspended or withdrawn for program non-compliance, the number of hours worked by residents still varies widely between specialties and individual programs. Some programs have no self-policing mechanisms in place to prevent 100+ hour work-weeks while others require residents to self-report hours. In order to effectuate complete, full and proper compliance with maximum hour work hour standards, there are proposals to extend U.S. federal whistle-blower protection to medical residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkey|first=Robert N|title=Federal Whistleblower Protection: A Means to Enforcing Maximum Hour Legislation for Medical Residents|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://open.wmitchell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&amp;context=wmlr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2F|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404012642/http://open.wmitchell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&amp;context=wmlr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2F|archivedate=4 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of limiting the work week include disruptions in continuity of care and limiting training gained through involvement in patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowe, MD|first=Merlin C|title=Have Resident Work Hour Restrictions Compromised Training – a Pediatrician's Perspective|url=http://www.doctorslounge.com/index.php/articles/page/295|accessdate=28 August 2012|newspaper=Doctor's Lounge|date=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns have arisen in Europe, where the [[Working Time Directive]] limits doctors to 48 hours per week averaged out over a 6-month reference period.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald JEF, Caesar B, 2012 399–403"/&gt;

Recently,{{when|date=July 2011}} there has been talk of reducing the work week further, to 57 hours.  In the specialty of neurosurgery, some authors have suggested that surgical subspecialties may need to leave the ACGME and create their own accreditation process, because a decrease of this magnitude in resident work hours, if implemented, would compromise resident education and ultimately the quality of physicians in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AANS News|work=|publisher=|date=|url=http://www.aans.org/young_neurosurgeons/spring_08.asp#DutyHours|access-date=11 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007155958/http://www.aans.org/young_neurosurgeons/spring_08.asp#DutyHours#DutyHours|archive-date=7 October 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted, however, that in other areas of medical practice, like internal medicine, pediatrics and radiology, reduced resident duty hours may be not only feasible but advantageous to trainees because this more closely resembles the practice patterns of these specialties, though it has never been determined that trainees should work fewer hours than graduates.

In 2007, the [[Institute of Medicine]] was commissioned by Congress to study the impact of long hours on [[medical errors]].  New ACGME rules went into effect on 1 July 2011 limiting first-year residents to 16-hour shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Program Requirements|url=http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/home/Common_Program_Requirements_07012011.pdf|publisher=ACGME|accessdate=29 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313215923/http://www.acgme.org/acWebsite/home/Common_Program_Requirements_07012011.pdf|archivedate=13 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new ACGME rules were criticized in the journal ''Nature and Science of Sleep''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dovepress.com/implementing-the-2009-institute-of-medicine-recommendations-on-residen-peer-reviewed-article-NSS |title=Implementing the 2009 Institute of Medicine recommendations on residen |doi=10.2147/NSS.S19649 |publisher=Dovepress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; for failing to fully implement the IOM recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2008/Resident-Duty-Hours-Enhancing-Sleep-Supervision-and-Safety.aspx |title=Resident Duty Hours: Enhancing Sleep, Supervision, and Safety – Institute of Medicine |publisher=Iom.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923160200/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2008/Resident-Duty-Hours-Enhancing-Sleep-Supervision-and-Safety.aspx |archivedate=23 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research requirement===
The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education clearly states the following three points in the Common Program Requirements for Graduate Medical Education:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acgme-i.org/web/requirements/internationalfoundational.pdf ACGME International Foundational Program Requirements for Graduate Medical Education.] Updated: 110211&lt;/ref&gt;
#The curriculum must advance residents’ knowledge of the basic principles of research, including how research is conducted, evaluated, explained to patients, and applied to patient care.
#Residents should participate in scholarly activity.
#The sponsoring institution and program should allocate adequate educational resources to facilitate resident involvement in scholarly activities.
Research remains a nonmandatory part of the curriculum and many residency programs do not enforce the research commitment of their faculty leading to a non-Gaussian distribution of the Research Productivity Scale.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Financing residency programs===
The [[Department of Health and Human Services]], primarily [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], funds the vast majority of residency training in the US.  This tax-based financing covers resident salaries and benefits through payments called Direct Medical Education or DME payments.  Medicare also uses taxes for Indirect Medical Education or IME payments, a subsidy paid to teaching hospitals that is tied to admissions of Medicare patients in exchange for training resident physicians in certain selected specialties.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb1997&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-20004039/medicare-funding-for-medical-education-a-waste-of| last = Gottlieb | first =  S. | year = 1997 | journal = USA Today | title = Medicare Funding for Medical Education: A Waste of Money? | volume = 126 | pages = 20–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall funding levels, however, have remained frozen over the last ten years, creating a bottleneck in the training of new physicians in the US, according to the AMA.&lt;ref name=Crosdale&gt;{{cite news|last=Croasdale|first=Myrle|title=Innovative funding opens new residency slots|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2006/01/30/prl20130.htm|accessdate=29 August 2012|newspaper=American Medical News|date=30 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some argue that Medicare subsidies for training residents simply provide surplus revenue for hospitals which recoup their training costs by paying residents salaries (roughly $45,000 per year) that are far below the residents' market value.&lt;ref name="pmid12224893"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reinhardt UE | title = Dreaming the American dream: once more around on physician workforce policy | journal = Health Aff (Millwood) | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 28–32 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12224893 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.21.5.28| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nicholson S, Song D | title = The incentive effects of the Medicare indirect medical education policy | journal = Journal of Health Economics | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 909–933 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11758052 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-6296(01)00099-6 | last2 = Song | first2 = D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson concludes that residency bottlenecks are not caused by a Medicare funding cap, but rather, by Residency Review Committees (which approve new residencies in each specialty) which seek to limit the number of specialists in their field to maintain high incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nicholson | first =  S. | year = 2003 | title = Barriers to Entering Medical Specialties | journal = NBER Working Paper No. 9649 |doi=10.3386/w9649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, hospitals trained residents long before Medicare provided additional subsidies for that purpose.  A large number of teaching hospitals fund resident training to increase the supply of residency slots, leading to the modest 4% total growth in slots from 1998 to 2004.&lt;ref name=Crosdale /&gt;

===Changes in postgraduate medical training===
Many changes have occurred in postgraduate medical training in the last fifty years:
#Nearly all physicians now serve a residency after graduation from medical school. In many states, full licensure for unrestricted practice is not available until graduation from a residency program. Residency is now considered standard preparation for primary care (what used to be called "general practice").
#While physicians who graduate from osteopathic medical schools can choose to complete a one-year rotating clinical internship prior to applying for residency, the internship has been subsumed into residency for MD physicians. Many DO physicians do not undertake the rotating internship as it is now uncommon for any physician to take a year of internship before entering a residency, and the first year of residency training is now considered equivalent to an internship for most legal purposes.  Certain specialties, such as ophthalmology, radiology, anesthesiology, and dermatology, still require prospective residents to complete an additional internship year, prior to starting their residency program training.
#The number of separate residencies has proliferated and there are now dozens. For many years the principal traditional residencies included internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, neurology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, otolaryngology, urology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and psychiatry. Some training once considered part of internship has also now been moved into the fourth year of medical school (called a subinternship) with significant basic science education being completed before a student even enters medical school (during their undergraduate education before medical school).
#Pay has increased, but residency compensation continues to be considered extremely low when one considers the hours involved.  The average annual salary of a first year resident is $45,000 for 80 hours a week of work, which translates to $11.25 an hour.  This pay is considered a "living wage," but it is far lower pay than that of the average first-year college graduate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Unlike most attending physicians (that is, those who are not residents), they do not take call from home; they are usually expected to remain in the hospital for the entire shift.
#Call hours have been greatly restricted. In July 2003, strict rules went into effect for all residency programs in the US, known to residents as the "work hours rules". Among other things, these rules limited a resident to no more than 80 hours of work in a week (averaged over four weeks), no more than 24 hours of clinical duties at a stretch with an additional 6 hours for transferring patient care and educational requirement (with no new patients in the last six), and call no more often than every third night. In-house call for most residents these days is typically one night in four; surgery and obstetrics residents are more likely to have one in three call. A few decades ago, in-house call every third night or every other night was the standard. While on paper this has decreased hours, in many programs there has been no decrease in resident work hours, only a decrease in hours recorded. Even though many sources cite that resident work hours have decreased, residents are commonly encouraged or forced to hide their work hours to appear to comply with the 80-hour limits.
#For many specialties an increasing proportion of the training time is spent in outpatient clinics rather than on inpatient care. Since in-house call is usually reduced on these outpatient rotations, this also contributes to the overall decrease in the total number of on-call hours.
#For all [[ACGME]] accredited programs since 2007, there was a call for adherence to ethical principles.&lt;ref name="pmid13678423"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lakhan SE | title = Diversification of U.S. Medical Schools via Affirmative Action Implementation | journal = BMC Medical Education | volume = 3 | page = 6 | year = 2003 | pmid = 13678423 | pmc = 212493 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6920-3-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to personal debt===
In a survey of more than 15,000 residents in internal medicine, approximately 19% of residents with more than $200,000 in debt designated their quality of life as bad, compared with approximately 12% of those with no debt.&lt;ref name=West011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=West CP, Shanafelt TD, Kolars JC | title = Quality of Life, Burnout, Educational Debt, and Medical Knowledge Among Internal Medicine Residents | journal = JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 306 | issue = 9 | pages = 952–60 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21900135 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2011.1247 | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/749203?src=mp&amp;spon=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, residents with more than $200,000 in loans scored 5 points lower on Internal Medicine In Training Exam than those who were debt-free.&lt;ref name=West011/&gt;

==Following a successful residency==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}

In Australia and New Zealand, it leads to eligibility for fellowship of the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]], the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]], or a number of similar bodies.

In [[Medical school in Canada|Canada]], once medical doctors successfully complete their residency program, they become eligible for certification by the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]] or [[The College of Family Physicians of Canada]] (CFPC) if the residency program was in family medicine. Many universities now offer "enhanced skills" certifications in collaboration with the CFPC, allowing family physicians to receive training in various areas such as [[emergency medicine]], [[palliative care]], maternal and child health care, and [[hospital medicine]]. Additionally, successful graduates of the family medicine residency program can apply to the "Clinical Scholar Program" in order to be involved in family medicine research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/postgrad/programs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216230339/http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/postgrad/programs.htm |archivedate=16 December 2014 |df= }} Post-Graduate Medical Education, McGill University&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mexico]], after finishing their residency, physicians obtain the degree of "Specialist," which renders them eligible for certification and fellowship, depending on the field of practice.

In South Africa, successful completion of residency leads to board certification as a specialist with the Health Professions Council and eligibility for fellowship of the [[Colleges of Medicine of South Africa]].

In the United States, it leads to eligibility for [[board certification]] and membership/fellowship of several [[List of medical specialty colleges in the United States|specialty colleges]] and academies.

'''Richard Lang''' is the Chairman &amp; CEO of [[Democrasoft]], Inc. He is also co-founder of the 20-year-old public company, Burst.com, Inc. that in 2010 transformed itself into Democrasoft. Richard is also the President of the Virtual Country Foundation, a 501c3 not-for-profit organization dedicated to increasing non-partisan civic engagement by citizens, via online and other resources.

==Biography==
Richard is a pioneer in the technology industry, having been the co-inventor of the world’s first, patented, dual-deck VCR in 1983 and co-founder of his first public company, Go-Video, Inc. In 1987, Richard invented (and later patented) a revolutionary solution for efficiently delivering video and audio programs over electronic networks, in “burst” mode, which created a foundation for today’s video-on-demand and audio-on-demand systems. He co-founded Explore Technology in 1990, which later became Burst.com, to develop and license this technology. Beginning in 2005, Burst licensed “burst” mode media delivery and network optimization technology to Microsoft, Apple and other preeminent companies in the industry. It eventually sold most of the remaining legacy patents in late 2010 and early 2011. Richard is also the author of a family of new intellectual property which address online collaboration methods and designs. This IP is currently assigned to Democrasoft, Inc.

Richard is the author of "[http://www.virtualcountry.us Virtual Country - Strategy for 21st Century Democracy]".

Richard resides in the San Francisco North Bay Area with his family and, in his spare time, is a prolific composer and musician.

==Collaboration Technology==
Richard’s passion for using technology to empower people is foremost in Democrasoft’s mission and supports Richard’s long-time vision for the evolution of democracy and the empowerment of individuals.

[[Collaborize Classroom]], a free online learning platform is Democrasoft's flagship product. The web-based educational technology allows teachers to extend their classroom discussions to a structured and private online community, on a topic-by-topic basis.

The [[tall ship]] '''''Spirit of New Zealand''''' is a steel-hulled, three-masted [[barquentine]] from [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. It was purpose-built by the [[Spirit of Adventure Trust]] in 1986 for youth development. It is 42.5&amp;nbsp;m in total length and carries a maximum of 40 trainees and 13 crew on overnight voyages. The ship's home port is Auckland, and it spends most of its time sailing around the [[Hauraki Gulf]]. During the summer season, it often sails to the [[Marlborough Sounds]] and [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], at the top of the [[South Island]].

The spirit of the project was derived from the sail training operations of the schooners "Sir Winston Churchill" and "Malcolm Miller" which were built for the organisation formerly known as the Sail Training Association (STA) https://www.spiritofadventure.org.nz/the-trust/our-history

The ship is used for a year-round programme of youth development, consisting primarily of 10-day individual voyages for 15- to 19-year-olds and 5-day ''Spirit Trophy'' voyages for teams of 10 [[Year 10#New Zealand|Year 10]] students. Once a year an ''Inspiration'' voyage for trainees with physical disabilities is run, as well as board of trustees and Navy training voyages. In addition, adult day, weekend and coastal voyages are offered to paying members of the public. The ship is usually in dry-dock for refit in November and does not sail on Christmas Day.

==Design==
The ''Spirit of New Zealand'' is a barquentine-rigged three-masted steel hull 33.3&amp;nbsp;m (109&amp;nbsp;ft) long, with an overall length of 45.2&amp;nbsp;m (148&amp;nbsp;ft) including the bowsprit, and a maximum width of 9.1&amp;nbsp;m (29.9&amp;nbsp;ft). She has a draft of about 4&amp;nbsp;m (13&amp;nbsp;ft) and a displacement of 286 tons. Under power, the ''Spirit of New Zealand'' can reach a top speed of 10 knots, and 14 knots under sail. A new engine installed in late 2010 is expected to increase the vessel's maximum speed.

The three steel [[mast (sailing)|masts]] are 28.7, 31.3, and 28.0 metres high and carry 14 sails totalling 724.3m² (7,965&amp;nbsp;ft²). There are 3 [[jib#Traditional vessels|jibs]] and 4 [[square sail]]s on the foremast. The main and mizzen masts are [[gaff rig]]ged, and both can carry a gaff-topsail. In addition, there are 3 staysails on the main mast.

The hull is painted black with the ship's name and the Trust's website painted in white at the bow and across the stern. In addition, a large [[Cyathea dealbata|silver fern]] is painted on either side of the bow beneath the name. A stainless steel rubbing strake runs the length of the vessel and circular port holes are visible above the waterline. A wooden rail runs around the edge of the entire deck.

The standard crew of the ''Spirit of New Zealand'' has varied during her lifetime, but in 2010 consisted of 1 master, 3 mates, 1 cook, 1 engineer, 2 cadets, 4 volunteer watch assistants, 2 leading hands and 40 trainees. For day sail voyages, the ship is registered to carry significantly more passengers. The trainees are normally split 20 male and 20 female, and sleep in separate accommodation. A change to the male accommodation was made so that 6 of the bunks could be separated from the remainder, allowing voyages to sail with 26 females and 14 males. This change was made in response to frequently higher female applicants than male applicants.

==Operational history==
In October 2013, the vessel was in Sydney, Australia as part of the tall ship fleet at the [[International Fleet Review 2013]].

'''''Teaching As Leadership: The Highly Effective Teacher's Guide to Closing the Achievement Gap''''' ({{ISBN|0470432861}}) is a book by Steven Farr, Chief Knowledge Office at [[Teach For America]], published by Jossey Bass in 2010. Farr and Teach For America share what the organization has learned about effective teachers over the last 20 years working to close the achievement gap. Based on this knowledge, the book outlines six principles that they believe will help teachers become leaders within the classroom, in particular, classrooms in low-income communities.&lt;ref&gt;Google Products| http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=teaching+as+leadership&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=2840361046004419494&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6LLWTYHPHc2cgQfd5JGMBw&amp;ved=0CFEQ8wIwBA&amp;biw=974&amp;bih=449#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teach For America==

[[Teach For America]] is a [[Nonprofit organization]] that recruits top college graduates and professionals to commit to teach for two years in urban and rural schools across the United States.

==Six Leadership Principles==

Teaching as Leadership includes a framework that explains the traits of Teach For America's most successful teachers. This framework is categorized into six leadership principles:&lt;ref&gt;Becoming an Exceptional Teacher http://www.teachforamerica.org/the-corps-experience/becoming-an-exceptional-teacher/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Set Ambitious Goals for Student Achievement===
Successful teachers in low-income communities set measurable goals for their students. Farr explains that these goals, along with strategies of investment, help both the students and teacher gain the motivation to overcome other obstacles and gain academic achievement.

===Invest Students and Families in Working Hard to Achieve the Goals===
According to the book, effective teachers work with students and their families to reverse low expectations that undermine a students ability to learn. "These teachers change students’ belief that intelligence is a fixed characteristic and show them that if they work hard enough, they will “get smart.”" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.teachforamerica.org/the-corps-experience/becoming-an-exceptional-teacher/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan Purposefully to Achieve the Vision of Student Success===
Additionally, effective classroom leaders plan backwards with every mission they set forth on. These teachers ensure that every aspect of their work is built upon well thought out goals and effective strategies.

===Execute Plans with Judgment and Adjustments===
[[Teach For America]] states that "Strong classroom leaders are effective executors, making good judgments about when to follow through on their plans and when to adjust them in light of incoming data. They offer their students consistent, caring, demanding leadership, and constantly seek to maximize the time students have to work hard toward their goals." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.teachforamerica.org/the-corps-experience/becoming-an-exceptional-teacher/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuously Increase Effectiveness to Accelerate Student Learning===
By critiquing their own work and constantly looking for new ways to improve their skills and leadership, effective teachers ensure that they are truly having an impact. These teachers use data to ensure that they are reaching their goals.

===Work Relentlessly to Navigate Challenges===
Finally, Teach For America states that "In many low-income communities, schools with the least capacity serve children with the greatest need. To make significant academic progress with students, highly effective teachers go above and beyond the traditional role of “teacher” and do whatever it takes to lead their students to academic success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teachforamerica.org/the-corps-experience/becoming-an-exceptional-teacher/&lt;/ref&gt;"

{{Italic title}}[[Image:Uni KA Portal.jpg|thumb|[[University of Karlsruhe]], a German technical university, founded in the 19th century, since 2009 it has been named Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]]
A '''''Technische [[Hochschule]]''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈtɛçnɪʃə ˈhoːxˌʃuːlə|lang}}, plural: ''Technische Hochschulen'', abbreviated ''TH'') is a type of university focusing on engineering sciences in Germany. Previously, it also existed in [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]] (''[[Technische Hogeschool]])'', and [[Finland]] (''teknillinen korkeakoulu).'' In the 1970s (in Germany) and the 1980s (in the Netherlands), the ''Technische Hochschule'' emerged into the ''Technische Universität'' (German) or ''Technische Universiteit'' (Dutch). Since 2009, several German [[Fachhochschule|universities of applied sciences]] were renamed to ''Technische Hochschulen''. 

== Terminology ==
{{Main article|Hochschule}}
In [[German language|German]]-language countries, the term ''Hochschule'' is more general than ''Universität'' (plural: ''Universitäten'') and also encompasses universities which do not have the right to confer [[Doctorate|doctorates]] and [[Habilitation|habilitations]], in contrast to ''Universitäten''. Today, ''Universitäten'' as well as other ''Hochschulen'' call themselves ''Technische Hochschule'' for historical reasons. However, a ''Technische Hochschule'' with the status of a ''Universität'' is regarded as a ''Technische Universität'' despite the name.

== History ==

Since the [[Middle Ages]], higher education institutions in Europe were called a [[medieval university|university]] only if a certain classical [[Wiktionary:canon|canon]] of subjects encompassing [[philosophy]], [[medicine]], [[law]] and [[theology]] was taught. When [[engineering]] sciences became more important in academica due to the [[Industrial Revolution]], institutions of [[tertiary education]] devoted to these were denied the prestigious denomination "university", and had to use the more general term ''Hochschule'' instead.

It was a major breakthrough, then, when in the first half of the 20th century, some ''Technische Hochschulen'' in [[Germany]] and ''Technische Hogescholen'' in the [[Netherlands]] were given the right to award the [[Doctorate|doctoral]] degrees, and again later when they were allowed to call themselves universities. This change of status was accompanied by a broader spectrum of academic disciplines and more fundamental research.

While most former ''Technische Hochschulen'' opted to change their name to ''Technische Universität'' to reflect their new status, some of them preferred to maintain their traditional and established names, most notably the [[RWTH Aachen]] in Germany as well as [[ETH Zurich]] and [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne|EPF Lausanne]] in Switzerland.

Starting in 2009, several German [[Fachhochschule|universities of applied sciences (''Fachhochschulen'')]] with a technical focus have changed their names to ''Technische Hochschule''.

== In Finland ==

The concept of a TH exists also in Finland as ''teknillinen korkeakoulu'', which is equivalent to a TH. Examples include [[Helsinki University of Technology|Teknillinen korkeakoulu]] in Espoo, [[Tampere University of Technology|Tampereen teknillinen korkeakoulu]] and [[Lappeenranta University of Technology|Lappeenrannan teknillinen korkeakoulu]]. Similarly to German speaking countries, most of them later changed their name to ''teknillinen yliopisto'', which is equivalent to a TU. However, [[Teknillinen korkeakoulu]] retained its old name until it merged with two other universities to form the current [[Aalto University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20157">The term '''twice exceptional''', often abbreviated as '''2e''',  entered educators' lexicons in mid 1990s and refers to  gifted children who have some form of disability.&lt;ref name="Beckley"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nrcgt.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/953/2015/05/spring98.pdf | title=Gifted and Learning Disabled: Twice Exceptional Students | accessdate=July 23, 2017 | author=Dawn Beckley, University of Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children are considered exceptional both because of their giftedness (e.g., intellectual, creative, perceptual, motor etc.) and because of their [[special needs]] (e.g., specific learning disability, neurodevelopmental disability etc.) Ronksley-Pavia (2015) presents a useful conceptual model of the co-occurrence of disability and giftedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronksley-Pavia|first=Michelle|date=2015-07-01|title=A Model of Twice-Exceptionality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162353215592499|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=318–340|doi=10.1177/0162353215592499}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2e child usually refers to a child who, alongside being considered gifted in comparison to same age-peers, is formally diagnosed with one or more disabilities.&lt;ref name="National Education Association 2006"&gt;National Education Association, 2006. ''The Twice-Exceptional Dilemma.''Washington D.C.:NEA.&lt;/ref&gt; Although 2e can refer to any general disability, it is often used to refer to students with learning disabilities, although research is not limited to these areas, and a more holistic view of 2e can help move the field forward&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronksley-Pavia|first=Michelle|date=2015-07-01|title=A Model of Twice-Exceptionality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162353215592499|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=318–340|doi=10.1177/0162353215592499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramo|first=Joseph|date=June 2015|title=Gifted Students with Disabilities "Twice Exceptionality in the Classroom"|url=|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=4|pages=62-69|via=nafme.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;The disabilities are varied: [[dyslexia]], visual or [[auditory processing disorder]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[sensory processing disorder]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[Tourette Syndrome]], or any other disability interfering with the student's ability to learn effectively in a traditional environment.&lt;ref name="National Education Association 2006"/&gt; The child might have a diagnosis of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], or diagnoses of [[anxiety]] or [[Clinical depression|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brody|first1=L.E.|last2=Mills|first2=C.J.|title=Gifted Children with Learning Disabilities: A Review of the Issues|date=1997|publisher=Journal of Learning Disabilities|pages=282–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often children with 2e have multiple co-morbid disabilities that present as a paradox to many parents and educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronksley-Pavia|first=Michelle|date=2015-07-01|title=A Model of Twice-Exceptionality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162353215592499|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=318–340|doi=10.1177/0162353215592499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no clear-cut profile of twice-exceptional children because the nature and disabilities of twice exceptionality are so varied.  This variation among twice-exceptional children makes it difficult to determine just how many of them there might be.  Best estimates of prevalence range from 300,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=S.M.|last2=Owen|first2=S.V.|title=To be gifted and learning disabled: Strategies for helping bright students with LD, ADHD and more|date=2004|publisher=Creative Learning Press|location=Mansfield Center, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 360,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Association for Gifted Children &amp; Council of State Directors of Programs for Gifted|title=State of the states in gifted education:  National policy and practical data|date=2011|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. (on the order of 0.5% of the total number of children under 18&lt;ref&gt;"In 2013, there were nearly 74 million children younger than 18 in the United States." [http://www.childtrends.org/?indicators=number-of-children ChildTrends Databank: Number of Children]. ChildTrends.org, last updated July 2014. Retrieved May 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Linda Silverman, Ph.D., the director of the Gifted Development Center has found that fully 1/6 of the gifted children tested at the GDC have a learning difference of some type.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Linda [www.gifteddevelopment.com/What_is_Gifted/learned.htm "What We Have Learned About Gifted Children"],''Gifted Development Center'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, in 2010 a conservative estimate of the prevalence of 2e children was around 40,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270894725_An_Empirical_investigation_of_twice-exceptional_research_in_Australia_Prevalence_estimates_for_gifted_children_with_disability|title=An Empirical investigation of twice-exceptional research in Australia: Prevalence estimates for gifted children with disability (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|doi=10.13140/2.1.1456.4160|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or approximately 10% of gifted Australian children, although other estimates have placed this much higher at 30% of gifted Australian children as being 2e.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Munro|first=DR John|date=2002-06-01|title=Gifted learning disabled students|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19404150209546698|journal=Australian Journal of Learning Disabilities|volume=7|issue=2|pages=20–30|doi=10.1080/19404150209546698|issn=1324-8928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misunderstood children==

Brody and Mills [1997] argue that this population of students "could be considered the most misunderstood of all exceptionalities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brody|first1=L.E.|last2=Mills|first2=C.J.|title=Gifted Children with learning disabilities: a review of the issues|journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities|date=1997|volume=30|issue=3|pages=282–296|doi=10.1177/002221949703000304|pmid=9146095}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In each situation, the 2e student’s strengths help to compensate for deficits; the deficits, on the other hand, make the child’s strengths less apparent &lt;ref&gt;Baum, S. &amp; Owen, S. (2004). To Be Gifted &amp; Learning Disabled: Strategies for Helping Bright Students with LD, ADHD, and More. Mansfield Center, CT: Creative Learning Press.&lt;/ref&gt; although as yet there is no empirical research to confirm this theory. The interplay of exceptional strengths and weaknesses in a single individual results in inconsistency in performance. They might present any of the three profiles identified by educator and researcher Susan Baum:
* Bright but not trying hard enough
* Learning disabled but with no exceptional abilities
* Average.
In the case of behavioral/socioemotional, rather than cognitive problems, both strengths and deficits can be intensified.
A 2e student’s grades commonly alternate between high and low, sometimes within the same subject. The child might have advanced vocabulary and ideas but be unable to organize those ideas and express them on paper. They might be a skilled artist or builder but turn in assignments that are messy or illegible. They might complete assignments but lose them or forget to turn them in. To the parents and teachers observing this behavior, it may seem that the child just isn’t trying. In fact, many 2e children work as hard if not harder than others, but with less to show for their efforts.
This struggle to accomplish tasks that appear easy for other students can leave 2e children frustrated, anxious, and depressed. It can rob them of their enthusiasm and energy for school and damage their self-esteem.

==Identifying twice exceptionality==
Twice exceptionality is not something that can solidly be diagnosed and therefore is not easily identified in students. Children identified as twice exceptional can exhibit a wide range of traits, many of them typical of gifted children. Like those who are gifted, 2e children often show greater asynchrony than average children (that is, a larger gap between their [[mental age]] and physical age). They are often intense and highly sensitive to their emotional and physical environments. The following chart summarizes characteristics commonly seen in this population.

In their early years, these children often seem very bright, with varied interests and advanced vocabularies (particularly with reference to same-age peers); and many times parents are unaware that they have a child with 2e. Teachers sometimes spot problems in school; sometimes parents are the first to notice their children's frustrations with school. During the early years it may be social difficulties. The 2e child may find it hard to make friends and fit in. Academic problems often appear later. As work demands increase, teachers may see a drop or inconsistencies in the student’s performance, sometimes accompanied by an increase in problem behaviors. Some 2e students withdraw, showing reluctance to speak out or take other risks in class; while others play the class clown. Some are unable to stay focused, find it hard to sit still and work quietly, and have difficulty controlling anger or frustration.

If these difficulties persist, school personnel or parents may decide that evaluation is needed. Along with a physical examination, children may undergo psycho-educational testing to determine the cause of their struggles. The professionals who take part in the process should be knowledgeable about giftedness. Some characteristics of giftedness can look very much like those of a learning disability or disorder and, as a result, gifted children are sometimes incorrectly diagnosed with disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, J.T.;  Amend, E.R.; Webb, N.E.; Goerss, J.; Beljan, P.; Olenchak, F.R. (2005). The Misdiagnosis and Dual Diagnoses of Gifted Children and Adults: ADHD, Bipolar, OCD, Asperger's, Depression, and Other Disorders. Scottsdale, AZ: Great Potential Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluation results should indicate the child’s areas of strength and weakness and identify whether any disorders or learning disabilities are present. In addition, the results should include information on what the child needs in order to build on the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses that have been identified. Teaching to students' abilities rather than disabilities increases self-concept scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=M.E.|last2=Mortorff-Albert|first2=S.|title=The effects of special education service on the self-concept and school attitude of learning disabled/gifted students|journal=Roeper Review|date=1989|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29–36|doi=10.1080/02783198909553227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Their strengths are the key to success for twice-exceptional children. They thrive on intellectual challenges in their areas of interest and ability. Many 2e children do best when given work that engages multiple senses and offers opportunities for hands-on learning. However, a requirement for success for these students is support, either given informally as needed or formalized in an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) or 504 plan.

Support can come in several forms. An essential form is encouragement; others include compensation strategies and accommodations in the child’s areas of weakness. For example, 2e students may benefit from learning time-management skills and organizational techniques; and they may need to have extra time on tests and reduced homework. It should be remembered, however, that the student's strengths should not merely be viewed as means through which they can compensate for their areas of weakness. Proper support for a twice-exceptional student must include accommodations to allow them to develop and challenge their gifts as well. It is essential for these students to feel as though they are being noticed for their gifts more than just their weaknesses, otherwise the student may fall into negative behavioral patterns such as the ones aforementioned. In sum, appropriate interventions should address both the academic and social emotional needs of 2e learners.

==Education==
Twice-exceptional education is a movement that started in the early 1970s with "gifted-handicapped" education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Maker |first = C. June |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL4559927M/Providing_programs_for_the_gifted_handicapped |title = Providing programs for the gifted handicapped |year = 1977 |publisher=Council for Exceptional Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term essentially referring to the same population. 2e education is an education approach backed by 35 years of research and best practices tailored to the unique needs of 2e students. It is a marriage between special education and gifted education—a strengths-based, differentiated approach that provides special educational supports. Many argue that talent development is the most critical aspect of their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=S.M.|last2=Owen|first2=S.V.|title=To be gifted and learning disabled: Meeting the needs of gifted students with LD, ADHD and more|date=2004|publisher=Creative Learning Press|location=Mansfield Center, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When teaching 2e students there are methods an educator should avoid. Twice exceptionality students do not respond well to lectures, and tend to gravitate more toward "big picture" learning. It's also important to understand that these students have a hard time following unnecessarily strict rules, and should not be expected to conform to them. Instead, being flexible with them, and focusing more on holistic, big-picture learning is recommended. 

Still, finding schools that can meet the needs of twice exceptional children can be a challenge for many parents. Public and private schools with programs that combine the appropriate levels of challenge and support for these learners are in the minority. For this reason, a number of parents choose alternative educational options for their 2e children, including [[homeschooling]] and [[virtual schools]].&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, L. C. (2008). No One Said It was Easy – Challenges of Parenting Twice-Exceptional Children. In M. W. Gosfield, (Ed.), ''Expert Approaches to Support Gifted Learners: Professional Perspectives, Best Practices, and Positive Solutions'' (pp. 269-276). Minneapolis: Free Spirit Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a handful of schools in United States offer a curriculum specifically tailored to 2e children. Some public schools offer part-time programs for twice exceptional students, where they can progress in subjects like math at their own pace, and meet other students like themselves.

==History==
The history of the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources at The [[University of Maryland]] is simply the history of the University itself. The University of Maryland was chartered in 1856 as the Maryland Agricultural College.  [[Charles Benedict Calvert]] spent $21,000 to purchase 420 acres in [[College Park, Maryland]], and later that year founded the college. The school opened on October 5, 1859 with a total of 34 students. In 1864, the state legislature designated it as  a [[land grant college]] under the [[Morrill Act of 1862]], which made federal funds available.  
By the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the University, having been hit hard by financial problems and a decline in student enrollment, found itself bankrupt. The state legislature assumed half ownership of the school in 1866, which pulled the college out of bankruptcy, and made the college, in part, a state institution. Enrollment slowly increased at the University, and over the next 26 years Maryland gained a reputation as a strong research institution. The federally funded [[Agricultural Experiment Station]] was established under the [[Hatch Act of 1887]], and new state laws granted the college regulatory control over several areas of agriculture and public safety. The school has grown over the years, adding several other academic departments. However, it still remains a land grant university, and continues to have a strong college of agriculture and natural resources.

'''The vanishing valentine experiment''' is a type of chemical reaction related to the [[Blue bottle (chemical reaction)|blue bottle experiment]]. This reaction occurs when water, [[glucose]], [[sodium hydroxide]], and [[resazurin]] is mixed in a flask. When the solution is shaken, it turns from light blue to a redish color. The solution turns back to a light blue after being left to stand for a while. This reaction can be repeated several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vanishing Valentine Chemistry Demonstration|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/valentinesdaychemistry/a/Vanishing-Valentine-Chemistry-Demonstration.html|website=About Education|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After mixing all the components, shake the bottle and the color will turn to red or pink depend on the amount of resazurin in the solution. More resazurin will result in more time needed for the solution to turn back the color and the intensity of the red color.

==Chemical reaction==
[[File:Vanishing Valentine Equation.png|centre|frameless|548x548px|Vanishing Valentine Equation]]
Glucose reduces resazurin to resorufin which will then be reduced again to a colorless compound dihydroresorufin. When dihydroresorufin is shaken, it is oxidized back to resorufin because when shook, the oxygen in the bottle will oxidize dihydroresorufin and make it back into resorufin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vanishing Vaentine|url=http://www.flinnsci.com/documents/demopdfs/chemistry/cf0667.00.pdf|website=Flinnsci|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pattern formation ==
Vanishing Valentine pattern formation is the new modification to the original blue bottle experiment which has a similar mechanism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This experiment was developed by Steven Engerer and Gilbert Cook, inspired by Campbell's work from 1963. Later in 1994, Cook made changes to the classic blue bottle experiment in his article called "Blue Bottle Experiment Revisited".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The possible application of this experiment is to identify oxygen level of intelligence food packaging and [[oxygen scavenger]] for [[super-resolution imaging]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Blue Bottle Experiment|url = https://www.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/tstj/article/view/42576|journal = Thai Journal of Science and Technology|date = 2016-01-01|issn = 0858-4435|pages = 1–11|volume = 24|issue = 1|language = th|first = Urawadee|last = Rajchakit|first2 = Taweetham|last2 = Limpanuparb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using [[methylene blue]] (blue bottle experiment), Vanishing Valentine uses resazurin that the solution will turn into colorless/fluorescent red.

During the experiment, the solution will be tested on a thin [[Petri dish]] to be easily observed. With the mixing of sodium hydroxide, glucose and resazurin the color of the solution will turn to be light pink. Then, stir gently until the whole solution turns bright pink. After leaving the solution for a few minutes to [[Redox|oxidized]], the bright pink colour will slowly fade into light pink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vanishing Valentine|date=2010|publisher=Flint Scientific|location=Batavia, IL|page=2|url=http://www.flinnsci.com/documents/demopdfs/chemistry/cf0667.00.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a certain time, the patterns will start to develop due to different densities of glucose and the oxidized product.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|title = The Colorful Chemical Bottle Experiment Kit: From School Laboratory To Public Demonstration|arxiv = 1504.02604 |date = 2015-04-10|first = Taweetham|last = Limpanuparb|first2 = Suphattra|last2 = Hsu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of pattern formations, the patterns will start developing with a ring on the edge of the Petri dish. Then, numerous dot-like pattern will appear, furthermore these dotted pattern will start to move in spiral or current-like movement. In addition, with more trial of stirring, the solution patterns will be slightly different. In other words, the first trial will acquire the clearest dots-like pattern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
