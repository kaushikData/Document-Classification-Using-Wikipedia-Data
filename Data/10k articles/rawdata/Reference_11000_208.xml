'''''1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die'''''&lt;ref name="_1001" /&gt; is a [[literary]] [[reference book]] compiled by over one hundred literary critics worldwide and edited by [[Peter Boxall (academic)|Peter Boxall]], Professor of English at Sussex University, with an introduction by [[Peter Ackroyd]].&lt;ref name="grimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt; Each title is accompanied by a brief synopsis and critique briefly explaining why the book was chosen. Some entries have illustrations. This book is part of a series from [[Quintessence Editions Ltd.]]

== The list ==
&lt;!-- Do not place the complete list here. It will be removed as a copyright violation.--&gt;
The list contains 1001 titles and is made up of novels, short stories, and short story collections. There is also one pamphlet (''[[A Modest Proposal]]''), one book of collected text (''[[Adjunct: An Undigest]]''), and one graphic novel (''[[Watchmen]]''). The most featured authors on the list are [[J. M. Coetzee]] and [[Charles Dickens]] with ten titles each.&lt;ref name="listology" /&gt;

The 2010 revised and updated edition of the book is less Anglocentric and lists only four titles from Dickens and five from Coetzee, who has the most of any writer on the list. It also includes a collection of essays by [[Albert Camus]], ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''.

There was a major revision of 280 odd titles in 2008.  The clear shift within the list has been the removal of ~300 works almost entirely by English language authors who have more than one title on the original list in favour of lesser known works, often by non-English language writers.&lt;ref name="bucketlist" /&gt;

Minor changes of fewer than 20 books were made in 2010 and 2012.&lt;ref name="bucketlist" /&gt;

'''Alcatraz Dining Hall''', often referred to as the '''Mess Hall''', is the dining hall of  [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] where the prisoners and staff ate their meals. It is a long wing on the west end of the [[Alcatraz Cellhouse|Main Cellhouse]] of Alcatraz, situated in the center of the island.&lt;ref name="Howard1977"&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard|first=Clark|title=Six against the Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBxtAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=August 1977|publisher=Dial Press|isbn=978-0-8037-8003-3|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is connected to the block by a corridor known as “Times Square”, as it passes beneath a large clock approaching the entrance way to the dining hall.&lt;ref name="Alcatraz"&gt;{{cite book|title=Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ivs4jv5KCQC&amp;pg=PT93|accessdate=31 August 2012|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-1-4521-1310-4|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; This wing includes the dining hall and the kitchen beyond it.

==Protocol==
[[File:Alcatraz Dining Hall2.jpg|thumb|left|Breakfast menu dated 21 March 1963]]
Dining hall protocol was a scripted process, including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move into and out of the hall at any given time, who sat where, where to place hands, and when to start eating.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward|first1=David A.|last2=Kassebaum|first2=Gene G.|title=Alcatraz: The Gangster Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kV6KXrkQjTsC&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=2 September 2012|date=19 May 2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25607-1|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners would be awakened at 6:30, and sent to breakfast at 6:55.&lt;ref name="docu2"/&gt;

The original daily menu, established in 1934, included [[oatmeal]], [[milk]], fried bologna sausage, cottage fried potatoes, [[toast]], [[oleomargarine]], and [[coffee]] for breakfast. Dinner contained bean soup, [[roast beef]], [[gravy]], string-less beans, [[mashed potatoes]], and [[coffee]]. "Supper" was a meal that had pork and beans, [[cornbread]], [[potato salad]], apricots, [[bread]], oleomargarine, and coffee.&lt;ref name="AH29"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rock/rock-029.htm|title=For Desperate or Irredeemable Types United States Federal Penitentiary Alcatraz|publisher=A History of Alcatraz Island, 1847-1972, Historic Resources Study|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A breakfast menu is still preserved on the hallway board, dated 21 March 1963. The breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed whole wheat, a scrambled egg, milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, and butter. Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15.&lt;ref name="docu2"/&gt; Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked in for the night.&lt;ref name="docu2"/&gt; Inmates were permitted to eat as much as they liked within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it.&lt;ref name="Mcshane1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mcshane|first=M.|title=Encyclopedia of American Prisons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wlje5poN3IQC&amp;pg=PA36|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=1 February 1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-1350-2|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AH30"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rock/rock-030.htm|title=For Desperate or Irredeemable Types United States Federal Penitentiary Alcatraz|publisher=A History of Alcatraz Island, 1847-1972, Historic Resources Study|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Alcatraz Dining Hall3.jpg|thumb|right|"Times Square" clock outside dining hall]]
At the end of each 20 minute meal, the forks, spoons and knives were laid out on the table and carefully counted to ensure that nothing had been taken as a potential weapon. Prisoners were forbidden from talking while eating, although many would do so discreetly; escape plans were often put forward this way.&lt;ref name="docu2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDjQkJUpl7M|title=This Is An Alcatraz Documentary (Part 2)|publisher=Narrated by [[Howard Duff]]|year=1971|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellman|first=Gregory L.|title=A History of Alcatraz Island:: 1853-2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1duAUPaHSgcC&amp;pg=PA36|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=28 May 2008|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-5815-8|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each dining table had benches which held up to six men, although smaller tables and chairs later replaced these which seated four.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; All of the prison population, including the guards and officials would dine together, thus seating over 250 people.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarat2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarat|first=Ausin|title=Studies in Law, Politics, and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVrQisInc14C&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=23 January 2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=978-1-78052-623-2|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The food served at Alcatraz was reportedly the best in the United States prison system.&lt;ref name="Mcshane1996"/&gt; On the second floor was an auditorium, which was where movies were screened to the inmates at weekends.

==Security==
The gun gallery was situated in the [[Recreation Yard (Alcatraz)|Recreation Yard]] and mounted on one of the dining hall's exterior walls.&lt;ref name="Champion2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Champion Jr.|first=Jerry Lewis |title=Alcatraz Unchained|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQV5wM6qj1oC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=2 September 2012|date=26 April 2012|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-8753-1|pages=140–}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a metal detector outside of the hall for security purposes. The dining hall had tear-gas canisters attached to the rafters of the ceiling which could be activated by remote control, should prisoners riot or attempt to escape.&lt;ref name="MacDonaldNadel2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Donald|last2=Nadel|first2=Ira|title=Alcatraz: History and Design of a Landmark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wfQWSJLKXdoC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=15 February 2012|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-1-4521-0153-8|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sloate2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloate|first=Susan|title=Mysteries Unwrapped: The Secrets of Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0yUpfWv68aYC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=1 April 2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4027-3591-2|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first warden, [[James A. Johnston]], always entered the dining hall alone and unarmed, due to heavy guarding around him.&lt;ref name="Sifakis2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sifakis|first=Carl|title=The Encyclopedia of American Prisons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObIQUpJxHZYC&amp;pg=PA130|accessdate=31 August 2012|year=2002|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2987-7|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several riots did break out in the dining hall during Alcatraz's history. Those prisoners who were not involved in the fighting hid under the dining hall tables to escape possible retribution.

==In popular culture==
The dining hall in Alcatraz has appeared as a scene in numerous films, television programmes and novels, often where criminals hatch plots to escape or crimes to commit upon escaping. It has appeared in films such as [[Don Siegel]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' (1979), and ''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult]]'' (1994), which has a scene spoofing the dining room scenes of the 1979 film.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5233">[[File:Prince_Ankhaf_at_MFAB.jpg|thumb|Bust of Prince [[Ankhhaf]], at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]The [[polychromy|painted]] [[limestone]] '''[[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of [[Ankhhaf]]''' is an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian sculpture dating from the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. It is considered the work "of a master" of [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian art]], and can be seen at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. &lt;cite&gt;Arts of Ancient Egypt&lt;/cite&gt;. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. p.78. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its catalog number is Museum Expedition 27.442.   
==Description==
It depicts a mature man and was therefore likely made during the reign of [[Khafre]] (circa 2520-2494 BC).  One of the earliest - and even after four and a half thousand years, still among the finest - true sculptured portraits, it is an almost unprecedented depiction of the unidealised features of an actual man.  Sculptures portraying true likenesses of people (rather than highly stylized portrayals) are rare in Ancient Egyptian art, both before and after the creation of Ankhhaf's bust.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. &lt;cite&gt;Arts of Ancient Egypt&lt;/cite&gt;. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. p.78. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plaster]] covers a limestone core, which has been painted red, a colour commonly given to males in both sculpture and in [[relief]]s (figures of women were typically painted yellow). The face is stern, with a slightly uneven mouth which makes him appear as though he is smirking from one side, and aloof and impersonal from the other. There is a slight droop to the eyelids, whose eyes were once painted white with brown pupils. The figure once had a beard and ears, which were broken away in antiquity along with part of the figure's nose.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. &lt;cite&gt;Arts of Ancient Egypt&lt;/cite&gt;. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. p.78. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bust was discovered in his tomb, installed within a small chapel oriented to the east and facing the chapel's doorway. His arms may have been sculpted on the small [[pedestal]] on which it sat, though these have been lost. It was evident that it had once been the focus of a funerary cult, as the bust had crushed several small pottery vessels of the type used for offerings when it fell in antiquity from its pedestal.&lt;ref&gt;Roehrig, Catherine H.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1999. p.234 {{ISBN|0-87099-907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Method of discovery==
The bust was discovered by a museum expedition funded jointly by the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] and [[Harvard University]], and under the contract of the time, such a fine piece would normally have found a home at the [[Cairo Museum]]. However, this piece was awarded as thanks for the extensive work done by this expedition and the discovery of the intact royal tomb of Queen [[Hetepheres I|Hetepheres]], who was Ankhhaf's aunt, a sister of his father. More recently, [[Zahi Hawass]], the chief of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, has asked that this piece be [[art repatriation|repatriated]] to Egypt, as one of five key items belonging to Egypt's cultural heritage, a list which also includes the iconic bust of [[Nefertiti]] in the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]], a statue of the Great Pyramid architect [[Hemon|Hemiunu]] in the [[Roemer-und-Pelizaeus-Museum]] in [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]], and the [[Dendera Temple complex#Dendera zodiac|Dendara Temple Zodiac]] in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;"Antiquities wish list" Al-ahram Weekly Online 14 - 20 July 2005 {{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/751/eg7.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916194918/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/751/eg7.htm |archivedate=2010-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Neonazis-schwarzer block.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Autonomous Nationalists adopted [[black block|Black Bloc]] demonstration tactics from extreme-leftist antifascist groups]]
The phenomenon of the Autonome Nationalisten can be traced to "Freie Nationaliste" (Free Nationalists), "Freie Kräfte" (Free Forces) and "Freie Kameradschaften" (Free Comradeships) movements, which developed in the shadow of the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD) ([[National Democratic Party of Germany]]) since the late-1980s. The police crackdown on the far-right after re-unification and the wave of banning in the early 1990s ("Deutsche Alternative", "Nationalistische Front", "Freiheitliche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei", among others) forced most of the local extreme far-right militant groups to split into "autonomous nationalist cells" of 5-20 members without a formal membership. Instead of conducting regular meetings, they started to use phones and later Internet for communication and organizing.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Schedler. [http://www.onleihe.de/static/content/springer/20110823/31281/v31281.pdf ‚Modernisierte Antimoderne‘: Entwicklung des organisierten Neonazismus 1990-2010.] In: J. Schedler, A. Häusler (Hrsg.).

[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/neo-nazi-fashion-thor-steinar-and-the-changing-look-of-the-german-far-right-a-587746.html Neo-Nazi Fashion: Thor Steinar and the Changing Look of the German Far Right], ''Spiegel Online International'', November 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), in 2001 there were 75 extreme-right organizations in Germany with 50,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2001/fall/reawakening-the-beast/extremism-across- Extremism Across Europe], ''Southern Poverty Law Center''. Accessed on 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the Autonome Nationalisten was controversial within the [[Far right in Germany|German far right]] milieu, both because some older activists of the German extreme right objected to their "leftist" image and because the NPD feared they would complicate its efforts to take part in mainstream politics.&lt;ref name="mares"/&gt; Also controversial was that Autonome Nationalisten had occasionally expressed sympathy for [[Islamic extremism]], as well as [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]] for their opposition to [[Zionism]] and what is deemed "[[American imperialism]]".&lt;ref name="doorbraak"&gt;[http://www.doorbraak.eu/gebladerte/11479f95.htm Autonome neo-nazi’s op de linkse toer?], ''Gebladerte Archief'' (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; The same controversies arose among the [[Far-right politics in Poland|far right in Poland]].

The Autonomous Nationalists in Europe made themselves visible starting from 2003–2004 and are now considered more violent than other members of the European far right.&lt;ref name="glet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nicola"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2008/05/20/Germanys-new-neo-Nazis/UPI-87471211285700/|title=Germany's new neo-Nazis|last=Nicola|first=Stefan|date=20 May 2008|work=[[UPI]]|accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2010, according to Miroslav Mareš, their impact in these countries has been limited so far.&lt;ref name="mares"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mareš|first=Miroslav|date=25 March 2010|title=Transnational Activism of Extreme Right Youth in East Central Europe |journal=Paper (first draft) for the International Conference "Far right networks in Northern and  Eastern Europe”, Uppsala University, March 2010| url=|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Message ==

Researchers view the [[Syncretic politics|syncretic political movement]] of the Autonomous Nationalists in Europe as a "strategic concept, organization and subculture – all three terms are possible for the designation of this phenomenon."&lt;ref name="mares" /&gt; They emphasize that, {{quote|autonomous nationalism as a political tendency certainly punches above its weight. It has influenced and sparked debates within the German far right, as well as within fascist youth movements in other European countries. As such it opens up questions over the future of fascist organisation in Europe, at a time when network politics appears to exert stronger mobilising factors than traditional organisational structures.&lt;ref name="New developments and contradictions in the German neo-Nazi movement" /&gt;{{rp|297}}}}

The Autonomous Nationalists were ideologically inspired by [[Strasserism]].&lt;ref name="mares" /&gt; The message of AN shifted to anti-globalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-imperialist ideas. It promotes complete organizational decentralization and autonomy inside the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Sommer, Bernd. Anti-capitalism in the name of ethno-nationalism: ideological shifts on the German extreme right, ''Patterns of Prejudice'', V. 42, No. 3 (2008): 305-316.&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of codes and symbols of the [[far left]] "Autonome Antifa"  by the "Autonome Nationalisten" coincided with the persistence of vibrant alternative subcultures of the radical left and rejection of traditional skinhead cultural-political templates of behavior of the extreme right.&lt;ref&gt;Von Rainer Brahms.

The Devil in Disguise: Action Repertoire, Visual Performance and Collective Identity of the Autonomous Nationalists, ''Nations and Nationalism'', V. 20, No. 2: 239-258, (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; These are often meant to display anti-capitalist and anti-systemic rebellion and opposition to globalization and 'American cultural imperialism'.&lt;ref name="New developments and contradictions in the German neo-Nazi movement"&gt;Schlembach, Raphael.

'''''Awake Zion''''' is a 2005 [[Documentary film|documentary]] by [[Monica Haim]] that documents a connection between [[Jew]]s and [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]]. Rasta is a religious movement that came out of [[Jamaica]]. The followers accept [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]] as God [[incarnate]], grow their hair in [[dreadlocks]] and smoke [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] for religious purposes. Jews trace their history back to the Holy Land of [[Israel]] and look to the [[Torah]] for instruction. Although Jews and Rastas appear different, both claim figures from the [[Old Testament]] as their forefathers, both send a message of truth and love to their followers, both speak of [[Zion]], both have integrated their beliefs into their lifestyles and Rastafarians also claim to be descended from the children of Israel. Haim, who relates to and enjoys both cultures, raises the question, "if we're both identifying with the same things, are we not then identifying with one another?"

==Summary==
[[File:Star of David.svg|thumb|left|The [[Star of David]]]]
[[File:Matisyahu.png|thumb|Matisyahu, a Jewish reggae singer.]]
In ''Awake Zion'' Monica Haim travels from [[Manhattan]] to [[Jamaica]] to [[Israel]], to interview Rastafarians and [[Rabbi]]s whose explanations of themselves sound strikingly similar.

In ''Awake Zion'' music is the link between the two cultures, and it was at a [[reggae]] concert that Haim, a young Jewish woman, first saw a connection between Jews and Rastas. "I distinctly remember sitting on a hilltop in the [[Pacific Northwest]] surrounded by smiles and dreadlocks and sweat and sun," Haim says, "the bass from the sound system echoing in my [[solar plexus]] while small gentle breezes swept past me leaving aural trails of hemp and [[lavender]]."

At one point, Haim interviews [[Super Dane]], an [[African American]] [[DJ]] who is part of the reggae scene in [[Brooklyn]] who is shocked by [[Matisyahu]]—a [[Hasidic]] reggae artist from [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] [[New York (state)|NY]]. "It blew my mind," Super Dane exclaims, "because I pass Jewish people every day and I thought they couldn't relate to my life. I thought they couldn't listen to my music."
[[File:Dreadlocked rasta.jpg|thumb|[[Rastaman]] with thick dreadlocks, though he has piercings, which may go against the teachings in Leviticus]]

The documentary raises questions that undermine a traditional approach to the Old Testament. "Did [[King Solomon]] have dreadlocks too?" Haim asks a Rasta. He smiles slowly and nods. Haim then turns to the Old Testament and finds that in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 6:5 it's written of [[Nazirites]], "all the days of his vow of [[Nazirite]]ship there shall no razor come upon his head." Later a rasta says, "the first plant to grow on King Solomon's grave was herb," and in [[Ezekiel]] 34:29 it is written, regarding King Solomon, "I will give them a place that is known for its good crops. They will no longer experience hunger in the land, and they will no longer suffer the insults of other nations."

==Response==
Most reviews of ''Awake Zion'' point to the documentary's social conscience, in trying to bridge a gap between two seemingly different cultures. Instead of being overly scholarly, Haim is said to have adapted a "gently irreverent" tone, which is full of enthusiasm and amusement.

Envious of [[Niobe]], the wife of her husband's brother [[Amphion]], who had six sons and six daughters, she formed the plan of killing the eldest of Niobe's sons, but by mistake slew her own son Itylus. Zeus relieved her grief by changing her into a [[nightingale]], whose melancholy tunes are represented by the poet as Aëdon's lamentations about her child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to a later tradition preserved in [[Antoninus Liberalis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], c. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Aëdon is instead the wife of Polytechnos, an artist of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]].  The couple boasted that they loved each other more than [[Hera]] and [[Zeus]].  Hera sent [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] to cause trouble between the two of them.  Polytechnus was then making a chair, and Aëdon a piece of [[embroidery]], and they agreed that whoever should finish the work first should receive from the other a female slave as the prize.  Polytechnos was furious when Aëdon (with Hera's help) won.  He went to Aëdon's father, and pretending that his wife wished to see her sister Chelidonis, he took her with him.  On his way home he [[rape]]d her, dressed her in slave's attire, commanded her to silence, and gave her to his wife as the promised prize.  After some time Chelidonis, believing herself unobserved, lamented her own fate, but she was overheard by Aëdon, and the two sisters conspired against Polytechnus for revenge.  They murdered Polytechnos' son [[Itys]] and served him up as a meal to his father.

Aëdon then fled with Chelidonis to her father, who, when Polytechnos came in pursuit of his wife, had him bound, smeared with honey, and exposed to the insects.  Aëdon now took pity upon the sufferings of her husband, and when her relations were on the point of killing her for this weakness, Zeus changed Polytechnos into a [[pelican]], the brother of Aëdon into a whoop, her father into a sea-eagle, Chelidonis into a [[swallow]], and Aëdon herself into a [[nightingale]].  This myth seems to have originated in mere [[etymology|etymologies]], and is of the same class as that about [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]] and [[Procne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | contribution = Aedon  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 23–24  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0032.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bibliotheca Norvegica''''' is a four-volume bibliography of Norwegian literature edited by [[Hjalmar Pettersen]]. The four volumes were published between 1899 and 1924, and comprise together more than 3,300 pages.{{r|obit}} The first volume is titled ''Norsk boglexikon 1643–1813'' and features a register of Norwegian books published prior to 1814. The second is titled ''Norge og nordmænd i udlandets literatur'', registering [[Norway]] and the [[Norwegian people]] in non-Norwegian literature. The third has the title ''Norske forfattere før 1814'' and the fourth ''Norske forfattere efter 1814'', recording the works of Norwegian writers before and after 1814, respectively. Pettersen had also commenced on the fifth and the sixth volume of the bibliography before his retirement in 1926, but these were never finished, owing to his death in 1928. Every volume also has an English title, even though the bibliography was published in [[Oslo|Christiania]], Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettersen|first=Hjalmar|authorlink=Hjalmar Pettersen|title=Bibliotheca Norvegica|year=1899–1924|location=Christiania|publisher=Cammermeyer|oclc=4479296|language=Norwegian|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Hjalmar Pettersen}}
Hjalmar Pettersen was born in [[Oslo|Christiania]] in 1856. He graduated with a [[cand.philol.]] degree in philosophy in 1882, and was employed by the [[University Library of Oslo]] in 1885. In 1898, Pettersen succeeded [[Jens Braage Halvorsen]] as chief librarian of the national department of the University Library. He started working with the ''Bibliotheca Norvegica'' immediately, in which he registered every work himself.{{r|nbl}}

==Volumes==
===''Norsk boglexikon 1643–1813''===
The first volume in the bibliography is titled ''Norsk boglexikon 1643–1813''.&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Full title: ''Norsk boglexikon 1643–1813: beskrivende katalog over bøger trykte i Norge i tidsrummet fra bogtrykkerkunstens indførelse til adskillelsen fra Danmark''. {{lang-en|Norwegian Book Encyclopædia 1643–1813: Descriptive Catalogue Over Books Printed in Norway in the Period from the Introduction of the Movable Type to the Separation from Denmark.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This volume is a catalogue of books published in Norway from 1643 to 1814, when the [[Constitution of Norway]] was first adopted. The volume is separated into two parts: one for the "real" book printings and one for the "poems of idleness".{{r|70ar}} Every work in the volume is sorted alphabetically by author and chronologically by year of publication when part of one author's bibliography. It is the only volume of ''Bibliotheca Norvegica'' in which bibliographical entries are sorted alphabetically.{{r|70ar}} It consists of 684 pages and was published in Christiania between 1899 and 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettersen|first=Hjalmar|title=Norsk boglexikon 1643–1813|year=1899–1908|location=Christiania|publisher=Cammermeyer|series=Volume I of ''Bibliotheca Norvegica''|oclc=186010852|language=Norwegian|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pettersen's biographer in ''[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]'' classifies this volume as Pettersen's "large contribution to the bibliography of Norway".{{r|nbl}}

===''Norge og nordmænd i udlandets literatur''===
The second volume has the title ''Norge og nordmænd i udlandets literatur''.&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Full title: ''Norge og nordmænd i udlandets literatur. Bøger og tidsskriftartikler om norske forhold''. {{lang-en|Norway and Norwegians in Foreign Literature. Books and Journal Articles on Norwegian Conditions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This volume deals with the reception of Norway and Norwegians in non-Norwegian literature. The volume is based on Pettersen's 1897 work ''[[Travels in Norway]]'', in which he registered foreign travels to Norway with corresponding travel reports. The volume grew so much, that it was split into three parts at a total of 850 pages. Although it is not sorted alphabetically, the third part of it features a reference over the books and journal articles listed in the volume.{{r|70ar}} The volume was published in Christiania between 1911 and 1918, and comprises 289 pages.{{r|obit}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettersen|first=Hjalmar|title=Norge og nordmænd i udlandets literatur|year=1908–1917|location=Christiania|publisher=Cammermeyer|series=Volume II of ''Bibliotheca Norvegica''|oclc=457596764|language=Norwegian|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Norske forfattere før 1814''===
The third volume is titled ''Norske forfattere før 1814''.&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Full title: ''Norske forfattere før 1814. Beskrivende katalog over deres værker''. {{lang-en|Norwegian Authors Before 1814. Descriptive Catalogue of Their Works.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This volume focuses on Norwegian authorship prior to the 1814 constitution, whilst Norway was in [[Denmark–Norway|union with Denmark]]. In contrast to the other volumes, the selection of works in the third volume is not based on objective criteria, but Pettersen's own discretion.{{r|70ar}} He chose authors which he considered to have a large national importance, and to be "independent of Danish literature".{{r|70ar}} The volume comprises 289 pages and was published between 1911 and 1918.{{r|obit}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettersen|first=Hjalmar|title=Norske forfattere før 1814|year=1911–1918|location=Christiania|publisher=Cammermeyer|series=Volume III of ''Bibliotheca Norvegica''|oclc=457596773|language=Norwegian|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Norske forfattere efter 1814''===
The fourth volume has the title ''Norske forfattere efter 1814''.&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Full title: ''Norske forfattere efter 1814. Beskrivende katalog over deres i udlandet trykte værker''. {{lang-en|Norwegian Authors After 1814. Descriptive Catalogue on Their Abroad Printed Works}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a register of works by Norwegian authors printed abroad, after 1814. It also included information on new editions and circulations of the works listed in it.{{r|70ar}} It has 1800 pages and was printed in Christiania from 1913 to 1924.{{r|obit}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pettersen|first=Hjalmar|title=Norske forfattere efter 1814|year=1913–1924|location=Christiania|publisher=Cammermeyer|series=Volume IV of ''Bibliotheca Norvegica''|oclc=496286473|language=Norwegian|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unfinished volumes==
Before his retirement in 1926, Pettersen had started working on the fifth and the sixth volume of the bibliography. The fifth was intended as an addition to the second and the fourth, and had 168 pages when Pettersen died in 1928. The sixth was to be a bibliography on [[Ludvig Holberg]] and had 48 pages when Pettersen died.{{r|nbl}} The sixth volume focused solely on Holberg, as Pettersen had been criticised for not having included him in the third volume of his bibliography.{{r|70ar}}

The '''Budd BB-1 Pioneer''' was an experimental [[United States]] [[flying boat]] of the 1930s utilizing the [[Savoia-Marchetti S.56]] design.  Its framework was constructed entirely of [[stainless steel]], using a newly patented method of welding that alloy.&lt;ref&gt;American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, ''[http://www.aiaa.org/aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/OUT%20OF%20THE%20PAST_Jan2008.pdf Out of the Past]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307131001/http://www.aiaa.org/aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/OUT%20OF%20THE%20PAST_Jan2008.pdf |date=March 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
By 1930 the [[Budd Company]] was a national leader in construction of railway vehicles containing considerable amounts of stainless steel.  Anxious to expand this expertise into other areas, company founder [[Edward G. Budd]] hired [[Enea Bossi]] to design and construct a flying boat of shot-welded stainless steel sheet and strip.  They contracted with the Italian aircraft company [[Savoia-Marchetti]] for the use of the SM.56 design.  The SM.56 was a single-engine three-seat flying boat.&lt;ref name="aerofiles"&gt;[http://www.aerofiles.com/_bo.html Pioneer page]&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian company granted licenses for construction of three units in the USA, one to Budd and the others to other companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerofiles.com/_pa.html Pioneer webpage of Aerofiles website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting BB-1 was a [[biplane]] flying boat, with the lower wing attached near the top of the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] and the upper wing held high above, with a single [[Kinner Airplane &amp; Motor Corporation|Kinner C-5]] [[radial engine]] mounted on the aircraft centerline between the wings.  Wheels mounted on the sides of the hull were retracted upwards during [[water landing]]s.  The single tailwheel was not retractable.  The pilot and two passengers rode in an open [[cockpit]] near the bow.

The [[prototype]] BB-1 first flew from the Budd Factory aerodrome, a field northwest of Philadelphia (Latitude 40.11/West Longitude 75.04).  The field is still visible, although not used as a landing strip.

Although the Pioneer was the first American airplane to be made of stainless steel, it did not go into production.  Another stainless steel amphibian, the [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] was the first to go into production, with one prototype and five production units manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fleetwings Seabird|url=http://www.goldenwingsmuseum.com/collection/AC-Pages/Seabird.htm|website=Golden Wings Flying Museum|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
The BB-1 Pioneer first flew in 1931.  Flight tests showed it to be typical in performance and challenging to handle on the water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msacomputer.com/FlyingBoats-old/italy/Savoia-Marchetti-S-56.htm Savoia-Marchetti S.56]&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft logged about 1,000 flying hours on tours of the USA and Italy. 

In 1934 its fabric and lower wing were removed, and it was placed on permanent display outside the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1639">The '''Bulgarian Historical Archive''' (Bulgarian: Български исторически архив) functions as part of the [[SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library]] and keeps more than 1.5 million documents and a separate collection "Portraits and Photos" consisting of 80,000 photos all of historical importance for [[Bulgaria]] and the [[Balkans]].

== History ==
The archive is one of the earliest historical document repositories in Bulgaria. It was established in 1878, just after the [[Liberation of Bulgaria|Bulgarian Liberation]] and was then known as the Archives Department of the library. Until the establishment of the State Archive Fund in 1951 it functioned as a national archive.

== Contents ==
The greatest number of documents come from the period middle 19th century to middle 20th century representing the [[Bulgarian National Revival]] and post-[[Liberation of Bulgaria|Liberation]] period of [[Bulgarian history]]. Also covered in great detail are the Bulgarian liberation struggles in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and the [[Adrianople Vilayet|Odrin]] region after the Liberation.

Some of the most notable specimens of the archive are:
*the pocket notebook of [[Vasil Levski]]
*the pocket notebook of [[Hristo Botev]]
*a fragment of a parchment with Greek minuscule script from the 11th century, the oldest manuscript in the archive

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37493">Α [[video codec]] is [[software]] or a device that provides [[encoding]] and [[Code|decoding]] for [[digital video]], and which may or may not include the use of [[video compression]] and/or decompression.

The compression may employ [[lossy data compression]], so that quality-measurement issues become important. Shortly after the [[compact disc]] became widely available as a digital-format replacement for analog audio, it became feasible to also store and use video in digital form. A variety of technologies soon emerged to do so. The primary goal for most methods of compressing video is to produce video that most closely approximates the fidelity of the original source, while simultaneously delivering the smallest file-size possible. However, there are also several other factors that can be used as a basis for comparison.

== Introduction to comparison ==
The following characteristics are compared in video codecs comparisons:
* '''Video quality per bitrate''' (or range of [[bitrate]]s). Commonly [[video quality]] is considered the main characteristic of codec comparisons. Video quality comparisons can be ''subjective'' or ''objective''.
* '''Performance characteristics''' such as compression/decompression speed, supported profiles/options, supported resolutions, supported rate control strategies, etc.
* '''General software characteristics''' – for example:
** Manufacturer
** Supported OS ([[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]])
** Version number
** Date of release
** Type of license (commercial, free, [[Open-source license|open source]])
** Supported interfaces (VfW, [[DirectShow]], etc.)
** Price (value for money, volume discounts, etc.)

== Video quality ==
The quality the codec can achieve is heavily based on the compression format the codec uses. A codec is not a format, and there may be multiple codecs that implement the same compression specification – for example, MPEG-1 codecs typically do not achieve quality/size ratio comparable to codecs that implement the more modern H.264 specification. But quality/size ratio of output produced by different implementations of the same specification can also vary.

Each compression specification defines various mechanisms by which raw video (in essence, a sequence of full-resolution uncompressed digital images) can be reduced in size, from simple bit compression (like [[Lempel-Ziv-Welch]]) to psycho-visual and motion summarization, and how the output is stored as a bit stream. So long as the encoder component of the codec adheres to the specification it can choose any combination of these methods to apply different parts of the content. The decoder component of a codec that also conforms to the specification recognises each of the mechanisms used, and thus interprets the compressed stream to render it back into raw video for display (although this will not be identical to the raw video input unless the compression was lossless). Each encoder implements the specification according to its own algorithms and parameters, which means that the compressed output of different codecs will vary, resulting in variations in quality and efficiency between them.

Prior to comparing codec video-quality, it is important to understand that every codec can give a varying degree of quality for a given set of frames within a video sequence. Numerous factors play a role in this variability. First, all codecs have a [[bitrate control]] mechanism that is responsible for determining the bitrate and quality on a per-frame basis.  A difference between [[variable bitrate]] (VBR) and [[constant bitrate]] (CBR) creates a trade-off between a consistent quality over all frames, on the one hand, and a more constant bitrate, which is required for some applications, on the other. Second, some codecs differentiate between different types of frames, such as [[key frame]]s and non-key frames, differing in their importance to overall visual quality and the extent to which they can be compressed. Third, quality depends on prefiltrations, which are included on all present-day codecs. Other factors may also come into play.

For a sufficiently long clip, it is possible to select sequences that have suffered little from the compression, and sequences that have suffered heavily, especially if [[Constant bitrate|CBR]] has been used, whereby the quality between frames can vary highly due to different amounts of compression needed to achieve a constant bitrate. So, in a given long clip, such as a full-length movie, any two codecs may perform quite differently on a particular sequence from the clip, while the codecs may be approximately equal (or the situation reversed) in quality over a wider sequence of frames. Press-releases and amateur forums may sometimes select sequences known to favor a particular codec or style of rate-control in reviews.

===Objective video quality===
{{Main|Video quality}}

Objective video evaluation techniques are mathematical models that seek to predict human judgments of picture quality, as often exemplified by the results of subjective quality assessment experiments. They are based on criteria and metrics that can be measured objectively and automatically evaluated by a computer program. Objective methods are classified based on the availability of an original pristine video signal, which is considered to be of high quality (generally not compressed). Therefore, they can be classified as:
* '''Full reference''' methods (FR), where the whole original video signal is available
* '''Reduced reference''' methods (RR), where only partial information of the original video is available, and
* '''No-reference''' methods (NR), where the original video is not available at all.

===Subjective video quality===
{{Main|Subjective video quality}}

This is concerned with how video is perceived by a viewer, and designates their opinion on a particular video sequence. Subjective video quality tests are quite expensive with regard to time (preparation and running) and human resources.

There are many ways of showing video sequences to experts and recording their opinions. A few of them have been standardized, mainly in [http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BT.500-13-201201-I ITU-R Recommendation BT.500-13] and [https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-P.910/en ITU-T Recommendation P.910].

The reason for measuring subjective video quality is the same as for measuring the [[Mean Opinion Score]] for audio. Opinions of experts can be averaged and the average mark stated as, or accompanied by, a given confidence interval. Additional procedures can be used for averaging. For example, experts whose opinions are considered unstable (such as if their correlation with average opinion is found to be low) may have their opinions rejected.

In the case of video codecs, this is a very common situation. When codecs with similar objective results show results with different subjective results, the main reasons can be:
* '''Pre- and postfilters''' are widely used in codecs. Codecs often use prefilters such as [[video denoising]], deflicking, deshaking, etc. Denoising and deflicking normally maintain [[ Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio | PSNR ]] value while increasing visual quality (the best slow denoising filters also increase PSNR on medium and high bitrates). Deshaking greatly decreases PSNR, but increases visual quality. Postfilters show similar characteristics — deblocking and deringing maintain PSNR, but increase quality; graining (suggested in [[H.264]]) essentially increases video quality, especially on big plasma screens, but decreases PSNR. All filters increase compression/decompression time, so they enhance visual quality but decrease the speed of coding and decoding.
* '''Motion estimation (ME) search strategy''' can also cause different visual quality for the same PSNR. So-called ''true motion'' search commonly will not reach minimum [[sum of absolute differences]] (SAD) values in codec ME, but may result in better visual quality. Such methods also require more compression time.
* '''Rate control strategy'''. VBR commonly cause better visual quality marks than CBR for the same average PSNR values for sequences.

It is difficult to use long sequences for subjective testing. Commonly, three or four ten-second sequences are used, while full movies are used for objective metrics. Sequence selection is important — those sequences that are similar to the ones used by developers to tune their codecs are more competitive.

== Performance comparison ==

===Speed comparison===
{{Main|Frame rate}}
Number of [[frames per second]] (''FPS'') commonly used for compression/decompression speed measurement.

The following issues should be considered when estimating probable codec performance differences:
* '''Decompression (sometimes compression) frame time uniformity''' – Big differences in this value can cause annoyingly jerky playback.
* '''[[SIMD]] support''' by processor and codec — E.g., [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]], [[SSE2]], each of which change CPU performance on some kinds of tasks (often including those with which codecs are concerned).
* '''Multi-threading support''' by processor and codec – Sometimes{{When|date=June 2017}} turning on [[Hyper-threading]] support (if available on a particular CPU) causes codec speed to decrease)
* '''[[Random-access memory|RAM]] speed''' – generally important for most codec implementations
* '''Processor cache size''' – low values sometimes cause serious speed degradation, e.g. for CPUs with low cache such as several of the Intel [[Celeron]] series.
* '''[[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPU]] usage''' by codec — some codecs can drastically increase their performance by taking advantage of GPU resources.

So, for example, codec A (being optimized for memory usage – i.e., uses less memory) may, on modern computers (which are typically not memory-limited), give slower performance  than codec B. Meanwhile, the same pair of codecs may give opposite results if running on an older computer with reduced memory (or cache) resources.

=== Profiles support ===
{{Main|H.264}}

Modern standards define a wide range of features and require very substantial software or hardware efforts and resources for their implementation. Only selected ''profiles'' of a standard are typically supported in any particular product. (This is very common for H.264 implementations for example.)

The H.264 standard includes the following seven sets of capabilities, which are referred to as ''profiles'', targeting specific classes of applications:
* '''Baseline Profile (BP)''': Primarily for lower-cost applications with limited computing resources, this profile is used widely in videoconferencing and mobile applications.
* '''Main Profile (MP)''': Originally intended as the mainstream consumer profile for broadcast and storage applications, the importance of this profile faded when the High profile (HiP) was developed for those applications.
* '''Extended Profile (XP)''': Intended as the streaming video profile, this profile has relatively high compression capability and some extra tricks for robustness to data losses and server stream switching.
* '''High Profile (HiP)''': The primary profile for broadcast and disc storage applications, particularly for high-definition television applications. (This is the profile adopted into [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] Disc, for example.)
* '''High 10 Profile (Hi10P)''': Going beyond today's mainstream consumer product capabilities, this profile builds on top of the High Profile, adding support for up to 10 bits per sample of decoded picture precision.
* '''High 4:2:2 Profile (Hi422P)''': Primarily targeting professional applications that use interlaced video, this profile builds on top of the High 10 Profile, adding support for the 4:2:2 chroma sampling format while using up to 10 bits per sample of decoded picture precision.
* '''High 4:4:4 Predictive Profile (Hi444PP)''': This profile builds on top of the High 4:2:2 Profile, supporting up to 4:4:4 chroma sampling, up to 14 bits per sample, and additionally supporting efficient lossless region coding and the coding of each picture as three separate color planes.
* '''Multiview High Profile''': This profile supports two or more views using both inter-picture (temporal) and MVC inter-view prediction, but does not support field pictures and macroblock-adaptive frame-field coding.

The standard also contains four additional ''all-Intra profiles'', which are defined as simple subsets of other corresponding profiles.  These are mostly for professional (e.g., camera and editing system) applications:
* '''High 10 Intra Profile''': The High 10 Profile constrained to all-Intra use.
* '''High 4:2:2 Intra Profile''': The High 4:2:2 Profile constrained to all-Intra use.
* '''High 4:4:4 Intra Profile''': The High 4:4:4 Profile constrained to all-Intra use.
* '''CAVLC 4:4:4 Intra Profile''': The High 4:4:4 Profile constrained to all-Intra use and to [[CAVLC]] entropy coding (i.e., not supporting [[CABAC]]).

Moreover, the standard now also contains three [[Scalable Video Coding]] profiles.
* '''Scalable Baseline Profile''': A scalable extension of the Baseline profile.
* '''Scalable High Profile''': A scalable extension of the High profile.
* '''Scalable High Intra Profile''': The Scalable High Profile constrained to all-Intra use.

An accurate comparison of codecs must take the profile variations within each codec into account.

''See also [[MPEG-2#Profiles and Levels|MPEG-2 Profiles and Levels]].''

=== Supported rate control strategies ===
{{Main|Rate distortion theory}}

Videocodecs' rate control strategies can be classified as:
* [[Variable bitrate]] (''VBR'') and
* [[Constant bitrate]] (''CBR'').

Variable bitrate (VBR) is a strategy to maximize the visual video quality and minimize the bitrate. On fast-motion scenes, a variable bitrate uses more bits than it does on slow-motion scenes of similar duration, yet achieves a consistent visual quality. For real-time and non-buffered video streaming when the available bandwidth is fixed – e.g. in videoconferencing delivered on channels of fixed bandwidth – a constant bitrate (CBR) must be used.

CBR is commonly used for videoconferences, satellite and cable broadcasting. VBR is commonly used for video CD/DVD creation and video in programs.

{{note label|theora_patent|*|*}} The [[Xiph.Org Foundation]] has negotiated an irrevocable free license to Theora and other VP3-derived codecs for everyone, for any purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Theora.org FAQ: [http://www.theora.org/faq/#24 isn't VP3 a patented technology?]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{note label|DivX_Plus|*|*}} DivX Plus is also known as DivX 8. The latest stable version for Mac is DivX 7 for Mac.

=== Native operating system support ===
Note that operating system support does not mean whether video encoded with the codec can be played back on the particular operating system – for example, video encoded with the DivX codec is playable on Unix-like systems using free MPEG-4 ASP decoders (FFmpeg MPEG-4 or Xvid), but the DivX codec (which is a software product) is only available for Windows and macOS.

'''Creative Playthings''' was an educational toy store and catalogue that was established by [[Frank Caplan|Frank]] and [[Theresa Caplan]] in 1945. The goal of Creative Playthings was to provide simple and beautifully designed toys to promote a child’s creativity and imagination.

The original Creative Playthings store was located at 102 West 95th Street in [[New York City]] (which they eventually moved to [[Madison Avenue]] and 72nd Street). Initially, Frank Caplan made hardwood building blocks himself to sell in their store, often cutting and sanding the sets while parents waited in the shop.&lt;ref name=TCaplan&gt;{{cite book|last=Caplan|first=Theresa|title=Frank Caplan: Champion of Child’s Play|year=1999|publisher=Vantage Press|location=New York|isbn= 0-533-12955-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then added animals, people, vehicles and other toys. Caplan believed that providing unpainted abstract forms that emphasized shape, color and texture, as opposed to lifelike details, would stimulate a child’s imagination. In collaboration with Martha New, Caplan also designed sets of large plain maple cubes that young children could rearrange into various forms and furniture. Known as "Hollow Blocks," these and other designs exemplified notions of “unstructured play,” in which creative usage could be shaped by the individual child instead of determined by the manufacturer.&lt;ref name=Ogata&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ogata|first=Amy F.|title=Creative Playthings: Educational Toys and Postwar American Culture|journal=Winterthur Portfolio|date=Summer–Autumn 2004|volume=39|issue=2/3|pages=129–156|doi=10.1086/433197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Caplan wrote in the first Creative Playthings' catalogue in 1949: "Play has a basic role in the drama of a child's development. It is a serious business for the child, his true means of learning and growing...Every child should have a wide variety of play materials to evoke in him a spirit of inquiry; to develop physical manipulation to the fullest; to stimulate creative expression. He requires not only the miniatures of real objects in the adult world, but also building blocks, clay, finger paints, et cetera, that he can adapt to his particular needs."&lt;ref name=TCaplan/&gt;

==Museum of Modern Art exhibition==
Beginning in 1949, Creative Playthings embarked on a series of collaborations with the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) in New York City. In 1949, the children’s room and playroom of [[Marcel Breuer]]’s "House in the Museum Garden" (a model one-family home in the east end of the MoMA sculpture garden) was composed almost entirely of Creative Playthings objects and designs, including their "Hollow Blocks." The exhibit was a tremendous success and received considerable publicity, including praise from [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], who commented, "I particularly like the children's playroom with nothing but those hollow blocks which could be made into furniture and still remain toys."&lt;ref name=Ogata/&gt; An article in [[The New Yorker]] also praised Creative Playthings' designs for their innovative and unconventional approach: "If the present kindergarten generation develops, when it has grown up, some rather horrid [[Folie à deux|mass psychosis]], I shall certainly be the first to blame it on the general vulgarity of the nursery decoration that our young exposed to. Parents who share my mistrust of cloying pink or blue color schemes, of the ubiquitous Donald Duck motif, and of the sort of furniture that looks like stunted examples of humdrum pieces should by all means investigate the nursery paraphernalia to be found at Creative Playthings."&lt;ref name=NewYorker&gt;{{cite news|last=S.H.|title=On and Off the Avenue, About the House.|newspaper=The New Yorker|year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Breuer house, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) and [[Woman's Home Companion]] cosponsored another model house in the garden featuring Creative Playthings' designs, this time by [[Los Angeles]] architect [[Gregory Ain]].&lt;ref name=Ogata/&gt; The modern "Hollow Blocks" and durable wood toy designs became much sought-after and in 1950 Creative Playthings was incorporated with Frank Caplan as president and Bernard Barenholtz as vice president. Incorporation allowed Caplan and Barenholtz to expand Creative Playthings in order to supply educational toys and equipment to schools.

==Furniture and playground equipment==
In addition to manufacturing toys for school and home use, Creative Playthings developed children’s furniture and outdoor play environments. Frank Caplan worked with such notable artists, architects, and designers as [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Henry Moore]], and Robert Winston on comprehensive playground designs - although some of these designs were not fully realized. He also collaborated with numerous international artists to design playground equipment, such as the Swedish sculptor, [[Egon Möller-Nielsen]]’s fiberglass helical slide.&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Susan G.|title=American Playgrounds: Revitalizing Community Space|year=2005|publisher=The University Press of New England|location=Lebanon, NH|isbn= 1-58465-517-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Creative Playthings again joined with the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) and [[Parents Magazine]] to co-sponsor a nationwide contest for imaginative playground design, resulting in a series of award-winning abstract outdoor equipment known as “Play Sculptures” designed by young artists.&lt;ref name=Montreal&gt;{{cite news|last=New York Times Service|title=Ideas to Exercise Body, Mind Sought for NY Playground|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=August 4, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stemming from Frank Caplan’s commitment to children in urban contexts, Creative Playthings sought to rethink urban play space and redefine the traditional jungle gym through modern art, encouraging children to explore different shapes, textures and spaces and use their imagination in active play.&lt;ref name=Ogata/&gt;

==Later partnerships==
In 1954, Frank Caplan began a close collaboration with Swiss toymaker [[Antonio Vitali]] to design a series of "Playforms" - smooth sculpted animals, vehicles, and figures in wood that fit neatly into a child's hands. The abstract "Playforms" became signature pieces of Creative Playthings and were highly praised by numerous design magazines and organizations, such as ''Interiors'' and ''Arts and Architecture''.&lt;ref name=Ogata/&gt;

In the early 1960s, Creative Playthings was the first company to manufacture and sell [[kalimba]]s designed by [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Hugh Tracey]]. They commissioned other musical instruments, including Xylopipes, a [[xylophone]] using hollow metal tubes, designed by [[John Rosenbaum]].&lt;ref name=JWeekly&gt;{{cite web|last=Caplane|first=Ronnie|title=Parkinson’s fails to squelch artistry of a former scientist |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/6286/parkinson-s-fails-to-squelch-artistry-of-a-former-scientist/ |work=[[J. The Jewish News of Northern California]] |date=August 8, 1997 |accessdate=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Caplan introduced the first anatomically correct dolls to the U.S., which was met with some controversy.&lt;ref name=Herald&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Anatomically Real Baby Doll Next|newspaper=The Herald Tribune|date=March 7, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Creative Playthings sold a repackaged [[Raytheon Lectron]] Series 3 model as their S822 Lectron LCIII.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lectron.info/#creative The Ultimate LECTRON Information Resource and Online Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Creative Playthings - Lectron S822 Model.jpg|thumb|Creative Playthings - Lectron S822 Model]]

==Acquisition==
In 1966, [[CBS]] purchased Creative Playthings as part of its move to corner the educational material and media market.&lt;ref name=Ogata/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=CBS Completes Plan to Acquire Stock for Creative Playthings|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 20, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank Caplan stayed on for two years as a consulting director and in 1968 became president of the CBS Learning Center. He eventually resigned in 1969. In the mid-1980s, CBS revived the Creative Playthings name to use on a line of wooden playground equipment. These were produced in Herndon, PA, and a CBS-owned plant, which had also made Tinkertoys. After CBS divested itself of its toy lines beginning in 1985, the name was sold to a playground equipment manufacturer in Framingham, MA.

The '''''Essential English Library''''' is a series of books, some [[fiction]] and some non-fiction, intended mainly for foreign students, though it is hoped that English readers may also find them of interest. The fiction has been chosen from some of the best writers, old and new, of [[English novel]]s, [[short stories]] and plays. The non-fiction consists of completely new books specially written for this series, on various aspects of [[England|English]] life and institutions.

The books are meant for serious adult students, and, though the vocabulary is carefully controlled, the style is natural and vigorous, and there is no question of any childish "writing down." The vocabulary is fundamentally that of the four books of Essential English. But, to widen the students' knowledge of the language, the same principle has been adopted in this series as in the later books of Essential English. So a number of new words (averaging three or four to a page) occur in each volume, but every new word is given, with the [[phonetic]] transcription, in the [[Glossary]] at the end of the book, and each word in the Glossary is defined within the vocabulary of ''Essential English''.

All the books are about the same length, and are illustrated with photographs or line drawings.&lt;ref&gt;The Country of the Blind and Other Stories, Fourth Impression 1954, [[Longmans, Green and Co]]. LTD.&lt;/ref&gt;

English teacher [[Charles Ewart Eckersley]] wrote ''Essential English for Foreign Students'', volumes 1-4, which were published by [[Longmans, Green and Co]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Essential English for Foreign Students [4 vols.]|url=https://www.librarything.com/work/9761053|publisher=Library Thing|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''EuroWordNet''' is a system of [[semantic network]]s for European languages, based on [[WordNet]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Vossen, Ed. 1998. EuroWordNet: A Multilingual Database with Lexical Semantic Networks. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; Each language develops its own wordnet but they are interconnected with ''interlingual links'' stored in the ''Interlingual Index'' (ILI). 

Unlike the original Princeton [[WordNet]], most of the other wordnets are not freely available.

==Languages==
The original EuroWordNet project dealt with Dutch, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Czech, and Estonian.  These wordnets are now frozen, but wordnets for other languages have been developed to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illc.uva.nl/EuroWordNet&lt;/ref&gt;

== License ==
Some examples of EuroWordNet are available for free. Access to the full database, however, is charged. In some cases, [[OpenThesaurus]] and [[BabelNet]] may serve as a free alternative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="841">In '''Ex Parte Sidelsky''', an important case in the South African law of succession, the deceased made a provision in his will (executed in 1944) to pay his daughter £55 per month out of his deceased estate. In 1982, the daughter requested the court to increase this amount, as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) had increased by 825% between 1944 and 1982. The court held that the testator could not have envisaged such a large increase. Accordingly the amount was increased to R1500 per month, and annual increases linked to the CPI were provided for.

'''Excavator controls''' specifies ways of how a human operator controls the digging components (i.e. swing, boom, stick, bucket) of a piece of heavy machinery, such as a [[backhoe]] or an [[excavator]].

==ISO controls==
[[File:Minibagger Beschreibung.jpg|thumb|Hydraulic excavator controls illustration, color of the control matches the moving part. Additionally there is a switch on the right hand joystick to operate attached tools.]]

The most commonly used control pattern throughout the world is the ISO controls. In the ISO control pattern, the left hand joystick controls Swing '''''(left &amp; right)''''' and the Stick Boom '''''(away &amp; close)''''', and the right hand joystick controls the Main Boom '''''(up &amp; down)''''' and Bucket motions '''''(close &amp; dump)'''''.

*Left hand left = Swing left.
*Left hand right = Swing right.
*left hand forward = Stick Boom (Dipper) away.
*Left hand back = Stick Boom (Dipper) close.
*Right hand left = Bucket curl in (closed)
*Right hand right = Bucket curl out (dump)
*Right hand forward = Main Boom down.
*Right hand back = Main Boom up.

==SAE controls==
Beside ISO, the SAE controls is one most common control patterns in the United States. It differs from the ISO control pattern only in that SAE controls exchange the hands that control the boom and the stick. The relevant SAE standard is J1814.

In the SAE control pattern, the left hand joystick controls Swing '''''(left &amp; right)''''' and the Main Boom '''''(up &amp;down)''''', and the right hand joystick controls the Stick Boom'''''(away &amp; close)''''' and Bucket motions '''''(close &amp; dump)'''''.

*Left hand left = Swing left.
*Left hand right = Swing right.
*Left hand forward = Main Boom down.
*Left hand back = Main Boom up.
*Right hand left = Bucket curl in (closed)
*Right hand right = Bucket curl out (dump)
*Right hand forward = Stick Boom (Dipper) away.
*Right hand back = Stick Boom (Dipper) close.

In the US, usually excavators comes with that kind of settings (SAE) from all manufacturers (''Komatsu, Caterpillar, Kobelco, Hyundai, Doosan, Hitachi, Link Belt, Kubota''). Some excavators have the possibility with the easy motion of a single switch, to change the operating mode from '''SAE''' to '''ISO''' and, from '''ISO''' to '''SAE''' (''Wacker Neuson'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wackerneuson.at/en/produkte/bagger/zero-tail-kettenbagger/model/ez28/type/Feature/&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Fultonhistory.com''' or '''Old Fulton NY Postcards''' is a historic newspaper website which contains archives of over 1,000 New York newspapers, along with collections from other states and Canada. As of February 2018, the site had almost 50 million scanned newspaper pages.&lt;ref name="cjr2-2018"&gt;Neason, Alexandria (6 February 2018). [https://www.cjr.org/the_profile/tom-tryniski-fultonhistory.php How Tom Tryniski digitized nearly 50 million pages of newspapers in his living room], ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The large amount of content on the site, at least three times as large as the [[National Digital Newspaper Program]]'s ''[[Chronicling America]]'' site as of 2013, is also notable because the site is operated by one person, Tom Tryniski, of [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton, New York]]. Tryniski began the site circa 1999 with a collection of old postcards of Fulton. Subsequently, he scanned the entire run of the ''Oswego Valley News'', the primary newspaper for [[Oswego County, New York]] where Fulton is located. In 2003, Tryniski purchased a microfilm scanner to expand his scanning project. As of May 2013, he is scanning approximately 250,000 pages per month.&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;{{cite news |last = Epstein |first = Jim |date = March 5, 2013 |url = http://reason.com/reasontv/2013/03/05/amateur-beats-gov-at-digitizing-newspape |title = Amateur Beats Gov't at Digitizing Newspapers: Tom Tryniski’s Weird, Wonderful Website |work = Reason }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dandc"&gt;{{cite news |date = October 10, 2013 |url = http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/memmott/2013/10/09/remarkable-rochester-past-comes-alive-through-newspapers-/2953635/ |title = Remarkable Rochester: Past comes alive through newspapers |work = [[Democrat and Chronicle]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haarlem - Teylers Fundatiehuis - gevel met zandstenen platen.jpg|thumb|right|Until the Spaarne wing was built in 1885, access to the [[Teylers Oval Room|Oval Room]] was gained through the front door of his Fundatiehuis. On either side of it, the same Ionic capitals were installed as in the Oval Room -giving visitors a foretaste of the architecture they would find inside.]]
The '''Fundatiehuis''' (English: Foundation House) is the former family home of [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]] on the [[Damstraat, Haarlem|Damstraat]] 21 in [[Haarlem]], [[Netherlands]]. After his death it became the seat of the [[Teylers Stichting]] and through its front door, visitors could reach the [[Teylers Oval Room|Oval room]].

==History==
[[File:Old cabinet with boxes that belonged to Teyler.JPG|left|thumb|Original cabinet containing the banker's possessions in Teyler's "comptoir".]]
[[File:'Grote Herenkamer' in Teylers 'Fundatiehuis'.jpg|thumb|right|The 'Grote Herenkamer' (Large Boardroom) in the room behind the courtyard adjoining the Oval room. Decorated in neoclassical style by [[Leendert Viervant the Younger]] in 1782. This room was used for Board meetings of [[Teylers Stichting]]. Above the fireplace a flower painting by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] has been installed.]]
[[File:Comptoir Teyler 2.jpg|thumb|left|Door with five locks]]
The Teyler legacy to the city of Haarlem is known today as the [[Teylers Museum]], but in 1788 it was composed of two societies: [[Teylers Eerste Genootschap|Teylers First or Theological Society]] (Dutch: Teylers Eerste of Godgeleerd Genootschap), intended for the study of religion and Teylers Second Society (Dutch: [[Teylers Tweede Genootschap]]), which was to concern itself with physics, poetry, history, drawing and numismatics. The caretakers had to meet in the gentleman's room of the fundatiehuis weekly, and each society had five caretakers, so all of the gentlemen involved lived in Haarlem. From Teyler's death onwards, it was the home of the ''artist in residence'', one of Teyler's many rules for the management of his estate. The first inhabitant after Pieter teyler died, was the local artist [[Vincent Jansz van der Vinne]].

===History of the building===
The building was built in 1715 for the wealthy commissioner of the Haarlem City Justice department, Hendrik Adriaan van der Marck. Van der Marck had a large library and when he died in 1740 Teyler bought the house in order to have more room for his growing library and collection of curiosities and stuffed birds.&lt;ref name=Teylers&gt;Teyler 1778-1978:studies en bijdragen over Teylers Stichting naar aanleiding van het tweede eeuwfeest, by [[Jan Hendrik van Borssum Buisman|J. H. van Borssum Buisman]], H. Enno van Gelder, [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]] , Schuyt, 1978, {{ISBN|90-6097-091-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teyler moved in with his wife, and they lived together there for 14 years until she died in 1754. The Teylers did not seem to take great pains to remodel the house, as the plaster work in the hallway downstairs still shows the Van der Marck family coat of arms.&lt;ref name=Teylers/&gt; Upstairs in a back room, Teyler kept office (comptoir) as a banker, and this office still has the original cabinet with his banker archive. Two years after his wife died Teyler drew up his will with the intention of preserving the house as a gift to the city, though he himself lived for another 22 years.&lt;ref name=Teylers/&gt;

==After Teyler's death==
The long hallway has the function of dividing the house in two, and the Teylers Stichting has used the various ground floor rooms for the location of the library and the meeting rooms for the directors, the religious society and the science society. The room at the back of the garden was used for member meetings. After the Oval Room was built, visitors could pass along the hallway through the meeting room to the Oval room. The old office used by Teyler himself became the office of the curator, and two smaller adjacent rooms with doors contain 3 and 5 locks, one for the Teylers Stichting and one for the science society, which held Teyler's coin and medal collection, the most valuable part of the collection on Teyler's death. The room with 3 locks could only be opened when all three key owners were present, and the room with 5 locks could only be opened when 3 of 5 keyholders were present. Considering the complicated lock system, there was clearly reason to fear theft of the items in the medal collection and in the early days the collection was only available by appointment.

'''Professor Kattungal Subramaniam Manilal''' ({{lang-ml|കാട്ടുങ്ങൽ സുബ്രഹ്മണ്യം മണിലാൽ}}) (born 17 September 1938) is an Emeritus of the [[University of Calicut]], a [[botany]] scholar and [[taxonomist]], who devoted over 35 years of his life to research, translation and annotation work of the [[Latin]] botanical treatise [[Hortus Malabaricus]]. This epic effort brought to light the main contents of the book, a wealth of botanical information on [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] that had largely remained inaccessible to English-speaking scholars, because the entire text was in the Latin language..

Despite the existence of [[Hendrik van Rheede|Hendrik van Rheede's]] [[Hortus Malabaricus]] over the last three centuries, the correct taxonomic identity of many plants listed in [[Hortus Malabaricus]], their medicinal properties, methods of use, etc., as described and codified by renowned traditional medical authorities of 17th century India remained inaccessible to English language based scholars, until Manilal commenced publication of research papers and books on [[Hortus Malabaricus]].

Manilal efforts ultimately resulted in an English edition of [[Hortus Malabaricus]], for the first time, 325 years after its original publication from [[Amsterdam]]. The English edition contains a word by word translation of all the twelve volumes of the book, retaining the original style of language. Medicinal properties of plants are translated and interpreted, with commentaries on their [[Malayalam]] names given by Van Rheede. In addition, the correct scientific identity of all plants, acceptable under [[ICBN]] are set out along with their important synonyms and basionyms.

Whilst the scope of Manilal's contributions to botany extend far beyond the research and publications around [[Hortus Malabaricus]], his research work on [[Hortus Malabaricus]] alone are of botanical and [[social history|socio-historic]] significance, and can be broadly classified under two heads:

*Botanical and Medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus; and
*Historical, Political, Social and Linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus.

Manilal has over 198 published research papers and 15 books to his credit as author and [[co-author]]. He and his associates have credits to discovering over 14 [[species]] of [[flowering plant]]s, varieties and combinations new to science.  Manilal is the Founder President of the [[Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy]] (IAAT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaat.org.in/index.html  Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623033942/http://www.iaat.org.in/index.html |date=23 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth, early life and interest in Hortus Malabaricus==
Manilal was born in [[Cochin]] on 17 September 1938. He is one of three children born to his parents; father Advocate Kattungal A. Subramaniam (b:1914~d:1973) and mother K. K. Devaki (b:1919~d:1989). Manilal's father, K. A. Subramaniam, was besides being a practising advocate, also a writer, who authored the biography of [[Sahodaran Ayyapan]]. Manial's Kattungal family members are natives of [[North Paravur]] in Kerala, India.

As a young boy, Manilal's interest in [[Hortus Malabaricus]] was inspired by his father, whose avid reading habits and enthusiasm for [[sociology]] exposed Manilal to a collection of books, and more specifically newspaper cuttings on [[Hortus Malabaricus]] during the late 1940s and 1950s.

Manilal schooled initially at the Government Boys’ High School, [[Kodungallur]] and later at the Government S.R.V. Boys’ High School, [[Ernakulam]]. He enrolled for undergraduate studies in Botany at the [[Maharaja's College, Ernakulam]], following which, he secured MSc Botany and PhD Degrees from University Teaching Department, [[Sagar University|Sagar]], in [[Madhya Pradesh]].

During his post-graduate studies, while on a study tour to the [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] in [[Dehra Dun]],  Manilal was able to see, for the first time, a set of volumes of the original [[Hortus Malabaricus]]. This was set of volumes acquired by the Institute's library during the days of the [[British Raj]], when the Institute was called the ''Imperial Forest College''. Manilal remarks “it fired my imagination!” on seeing a [[Latin]] book in which the names of plants were also written in native [[Malayalam]] language. Manilal maintained his interest in the book through his studies and professional life until 1969, when he commenced serious work on the transliteration of [[Hortus Malabaricus]].

==Major research and academic achievements==

===Botanical and medicinal aspects of Hortus Malabaricus===
[[File:HortusMalabaricus.jpg|175px|right|thumb|Frontispiece of the original Latin Hortus Malabaricus]]
As [[Hortus Malabaricus]] is a pre-[[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] book, the scientific names of plants, equivalent to local Malayalam names, were not included. Since voucher specimens for the book are also not known to exist, the correct identity of many of the plants described was unclear and not verifiable to original specimens. Earlier attempts, over three centuries, by European and Indian botanists to correctly identify all specimens were futile. Under two research projects; one sponsored by the [[University Grants Commission (India)|U.G.C.]] (1975–1978) and the other by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] (1984–1987), Manilal collected all plants, described in Hortus Malabaricus, from localities in Malabar from where they were originally collected in the 17th century. Specimens were subjected to detailed studies and their correct identities were established in consultation with research institutes in Europe and USA.&lt;ref name="theinterpretationofhortus"&gt;{{cite book | author= Nicolson, Suresh, Manilal | title=An Interpretation of Van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus | year= 1988| issn= 0080-0694 |journal=Regnum Vegetabile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this work, initially a concise reference book: ''An Interpretation of Van Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus'', was published (with his collaborators) from Berlin (1988), by the [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy|IAPT]]. This remains the only book by Indian authors published by them (IAPT) till date and is an essential resource in study on the taxonomy of Southeast Asian plants.

===Historical, political, social and linguistic aspects of Hortus Malabaricus===

The compilation and publication of Hortus Malabaricus is intimately connected with the history of India, politics of the 17th century Netherlands and the then social conditions of Malabar. It is also an important source of information, and the oldest printed, authentic document, on the evolution of [[Malayalam]] language and script. Manilal studied these aspects for over 35 years bringing to light many interesting facts, some of which were included in his book: ''Botany &amp; History of Hortus Malabaricus'', published from Rotterdam and Delhi (1980). Another book, in Malayalam: ''A study on the role of [[Itty Achudan]] in the compilation of Hortus Malabaricus'', was published from [[Kozhikode]] in 1996.

Van Rheede's motivation to compile a book on the natural plant wealth of Malabar was to prove his belief that Malabar is self-sufficient in all requirements of military and commerce and hence that Cochin was better suited to be the south east Asian Headquarters of the Dutch overseas forces, compared to [[Colombo]] in [[Ceylon]].

Information is also available in the text of Hortus Malabaricus not only about the vegetation in 17th century Malabar, but also about the general social conditions prevalent in those days. Significant inferences could also be drawn on some of these matters, indirectly from the data available in the book. Several research papers have been published by Manilal on these topics. Some more, particularly on the different Numerals and Numerical Systems used in Hortus and their sociological implications and significances in the Indian society, are under preparation.

===Taxonomic and biodiversity studies in Kerala===

Manilal pioneered taxonomic research and [[biodiversity]] studies in Kerala by training a genre of young taxonomists and identifying and cataloguing local plants in biodiversity-rich [[South India]]. A comprehensive study on the [[flora]] of the [[Kozhikode|Greater Kozhikode]] area, consisting of the western sectors of the present day [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]] and [[Malappuram district|Malappuram]] districts, covering an area of about 600&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. was started in 1969. When completed in 1975, this work resulted in recording about one thousand [[species]] of [[flowering plant]]s from the region, including several species recorded for the first time in India and importantly seven species new to science. Based on this work, a book: ''Flora of Calicut'', was published (from [[Dehra Dun]]), and was taken as a model for subsequent research in India.

===Research and revelations at Silent Valley===

In the 1970s, when a proposal to build a [[hydro-electric]] project in [[Silent Valley National Park|Silent Valley]] triggered political controversy in [[Kerala]] due to an impending [[ecological disaster]], the [[Government of Kerala]] appointed an experts’ committee of scientists to study, inventorise and report on Silent Valley's [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. The experts’ committee reported that the forests there could not be classified as ''tropical evergreen rainforests'' and that they contain only 240 species of flowering plants, which are also found elsewhere, and also that the Valley does not possess any new or rare species. Despite protests by [[environmentalists]] the State Government was about to go ahead with the project, only awaiting a clearance form the [[Government of India|Central Government]]. At this juncture, the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)]] accepted Manilal's proposal to study the [[flora]] of Silent Valley and also required him to make a general study of the ecological status of the forests.

Over a four-year period commencing 1981, Manilal and research assistants undertook a study that brought to light:

* A record of nearly 1,000 species of flowering plants;
* Seven species new to science;
* Several plants believed to be found only in [[Sri Lanka]], Philippines, etc.;
* Some species which were believed to be [[extinct]], such as the ''Malabar Daffodil'', which was last seen in 1850 by a scientist named [[Thomas C. Jerdon]] in [[Nilgiris (mountains)|Nilgiris]];
* Rare medicinal plants until then known to grow only in the islands of Philippines;
* Many endemics of the neighbouring countries, where their existence was threatened, were found to have migrated to these forests for safety.

Further Manilal's study found that the Silent Valley forests fulfilled required parameters of ''tropical evergreen rainforests'' and, therefore, could be rightly so classified. His work was soon considered as model of how taxonomists could assist in solving socio-environmental issues; and many scientists and journalists from Europe, Africa and South America visited Silent Valley to study the working of this project.

===Orchids of  Kerala===

Detailed studies of the [[orchid]] wealth of Kerala were started by Manilal in the late 1970s, including their taxonomy, anatomy, biology and floral evolution, which are essential for any further studies on their [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]]. During these studies, contrary to the highest expectations, over 215 species of  orchids were collected, including species that were till then believed to be extinct, like the ladies' slipper orchid ''Paphiopedilum druryii''.

===Origin and evolution of the flower===

Manilal  has led studies on the directions of evolution of flowers and the structure and [[anatomy]] of various floral organs in [[cash crops]] such as [[coconut]] palms, grasses (rice), [[orchid]]s, [[compositae]] ([[sun flower]]), [[rubiales]] (coffee), etc. Many enigmas in these subjects could be solved, and results were published in around 45 research papers. These studies have, besides seeing the flower as the most significant part of the plant, with biological, commercial, aesthetic, evolutionary and taxonomic importance, also promoted success in [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] and breeding experiments, to create new high-yielding varieties.

===Radioactive resistant marine phyto-planktonic algae===

As the beaches in southern Kerala and [[Tamil Nadu]] (particularly in the Districts of [[Kollam]] and [[Nagarcoil]]) have natural deposits of radioactive minerals causing genetic damage to flora and fauna, Manilal undertook studies to familiarise with the techniques of  research in the field of radiation ecology. These studies were undertaken at the Marine Biology Laboratory of North Wales University at [[Menai Bridge]], Wales. The [[Royal Society of London]] granted Manilal a Visiting Scientist-ship for this work for two years in 1971–1972.

Two species of marine phyto-planktonic [[algae]] were discovered, which could withstand a very high degree of [[radioactivity]]. It was found that these species could absorb and adsorb as much as 40 times their body weight of the radioactive [[Thorium]] compounds from surrounding seawater, and continue to live normally.  In the 1970s these findings were farfetched to be accepted for publication in a journal in U.K. However, on Manilal's return to India, a part of these findings was published in the journal Current Science (1975), by the [[Indian Institute of Science]]. About ten years later, some British scientists did a similar work and their results were published in the prestigious U.K. journal Nature, and wide publicity in the press as a biotechnological break-through. Manilal's experiments (and the subsequent work by the British scientists) show that such marine planktonic algae could be used to quickly and safely clean up ocean surfaces where radio-active materials have accumulated, by cultivating such algae in a specific area and later removing them from there.

===Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy (IAAT)===

Manilal was instrumental in establishing the [[Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy]] (IAAT). Manilal, as founder President, established IAAT in the year 1990 with its Headquarters located at the Department of Botany, [[University of Calicut]], [[Kozhikode]], India. The IAAT works to promote the science of Angiosperm Taxonomy in India, to provide a common forum for Angiosperm taxonomists in India to organise meetings, hold discussions and exchange ideas on scientific and academic matters, and encourage collaborative work among taxonomists. The IAAT publishes a journal Rheedea (named after [[Hendrik van Rheede]]). The Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy works as an affiliate of the [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy]].

From 1969 Manilal commenced training research students in [[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomy]] (leading to PhD degree in the subject), with a view to attain self-sufficiency in Taxonomy. During the years 1972–1998, he and his students discovered over 240 new species of flowering plants and several new records for India from Kerala, and published many research papers in Taxonomy in national and international journals.

===Biomass Research Centre===

A [[Biomass]] Research Centre was established by Manilal in the [[University of Calicut]], with funding from the Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources. The Centre does research and field experiments to establish the (taxonomic) identification of fast-growing fuel-wood trees suitable for various agro-climatic zones of [[Kerala]].

==Publication of the English and Malayalam versions of Hortus Malabaricus==

===Publisher's appeal for donation of royalties===

[[Hortus Malabaricus]] as transliterated by Manilal was published in English and Malayalam languages in 2003 and 2008 respectively. Manilal's copyright, as author of the English and Malayalam versions, was bequeathed, free of [[royalties]], to the publishers, the [[University of Kerala]].&lt;ref name="harithabhoopadam"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Antony | first1 = Joseph | title = Harithabhoopadam | edition = 1 | publisher = Mathrubhumi books | year = 2012 | location = [[Kozhikode]]| pages = 152–155 | url = http://buy.mathrubhumi.com/books/mathrubhumi/essays/bookdetails/1104/harithabhoopadam | accessdate = 2012-03-11 | isbn = 978-81-8265-291-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assignment of rights was a gesture by Manilal in good faith and in response to a specific appeal from the then Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Kerala]], that the University wanted to generate funds from this publication for utilisation of such royalty incomes toward re-publication of old Malayalam classical works, which are out of print, and not forecasted to generate a viable level of income due to limited sale of such classical works.

===Book-release functions conducted by the publishers===

In a recorded interview with Manilal in August 2008, he expressed his regret and frustration at the manner in which the publishers subjected him to digression from the publication project soon after he legally assigned his rights as author. Apparently there was a move to exclude Manilal's name from the book (2003), but was reinstated on account of questions raised by the academic community.&lt;ref name="harithabhoopadam" /&gt; On 14 August 2008, the University of Kerala officials again conducted a function at [[Thiruvananthapuram]] to formally release the Malayalam edition of Hortus Malabaricus. The book was released by the [[Governor of Kerala]] (also Chancellor of the University), at the function; where due recognition was not given to Manilal as author of the book, nor were arrangements in place to felicitate the author at the function. [http://www.hindu.com/2008/08/15/stories/2008081561050300.htm]. The former Vice-Chancellor of [[University of Kerala]] who initiated the project, [[B. Ekbal]], was also not invited to this function.

{{nihongo|'''Koichi Toyama'''|外山 恒一|Toyama Kōichi|born July 26, 1970|lead=yes}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[street musician]] and a fringe political activist who was a candidate for the governor of [[Tokyo]] in 2007. He was born in [[Kagoshima Prefecture]] and lives in [[Fukuoka]]. He gained notoriety with his provocative [[Tokyo gubernatorial election, 2007|2007 Tokyo gubernatorial election]] speech.&lt;ref&gt;http://ascii.jp/elem/000/000/122/122783/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2013/12/26/toyama-koichi_n_4504565.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

==Election Commission response==
In 2007 the Tokyo election commission asked YouTube to remove election speeches of candidates, allegedly to "ensure fairness" among candidates, because YouTube had "allowed only certain candidates' speeches to be viewed freely on the site", according to an election official. According to Japanese election law, the broadcasting of speeches is only allowed on public broadcaster [[NHK]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070409030821/http://www.physorg.com/news95008106.html Tokyo requests YouTube delete candidates' speeches], physorg.com, 5 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lamparello v. Falwell''''', 420 [[F.3d]] 309, was a legal case heard by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] concerning allegations of [[cybersquatting]] and [[trademark infringement]].  The dispute centered on the right to use the [[domain name]] fallwell.com, and provides discussion on [[cybersquatting]] as it applies to criticism of a [[trademark]].

In 1999, [[Christopher Lamparello]] created a [[website]] to respond to and criticize the anti-homosexual statements by the American [[Christian evangelicalism|Christian evangelical]] preacher [[Jerry Falwell]].  Lamparello's website was located at fallwell.com (note the misspelling).  Believing that there was confusing similarity between the [[domain name]] and Falwell's own name, domain name, and other trademarks, Falwell and his ministries attempted to legally block Lamparello from using the mark "fallwell" and transfer the ownership of the domain name to Falwell.

The initial decisions (ruled by the [[National Arbitration Forum]] in 2003 and the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] in 2004) decided in favor of Falwell, granting Falwell's claims of federal trademark infringement, [[false designation of origin]], [[unfair competition]], and cybersquatting.

On appeal in 2005, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] reversed the earlier decisions, ruling that there was not a "likelihood of confusion" between Lamparello's and Falwell's official site; that there was no trademark infringement based on "initial interest confusion" for sites that were non-commercial and critical of the trademark holder; and since Lamparello's site was non-commercial, there was no "bad faith intent to profit" and it was not cybersquatting.

==Background==

In 1999, Christopher Lamparello registered the domain name fallwell.com and used the affiliated website as a [[gripe site]] to express his negative opinions about the [[Fundamentalist Christian]] preacher Jerry Falwell's public statements against [[homosexuality]].

Lamparello's site was plainly critical of Falwell and had very little viewership.&lt;ref name="NAFDecision"/&gt;  The website offered no goods or services for sale, though the website contained a link to a separate [[Amazon.com]] webpage selling a book supporting his views, but Lamparello did not stand to financially gain from the sales of the book.  Lamparello's website also contained prominent statements declaring that it was not affiliated with Falwell and his ministry, and provided a hyperlink to redirect viewers to Falwell's official website.&lt;ref name="NAFDecision"/&gt;  Lamparello claimed that the domain name was chosen as a [[parody]] of Falwell's name, combining "fall" and "well".&lt;ref name="PCLGBrief"/&gt;  

Falwell had a registered [[trademark]] in the name "Listen America with Jerry Falwell".  At the time, Falwell did not have any registered trademarks in the names "Falwell" or "Fallwell", but was in the process of registering the name "Jerry Falwell".  Falwell had an official website at the domain name falwell.com, where he also sold goods.&lt;ref name="NAFDecision"/&gt;

Believing in a confusing similarity between the two domain names, Falwell sent Lamparello letters in 2001 and 2003 demanding that Lamparello cease and desist from using fallwell.com or any variation of Falwell's name as a domain name.  Lamparello did not comply.
&lt;!-- The 1999 [[Anti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]] (ACPA) contains a clause (Section 3(a), amending {{UnitedStatesCode|15|1117}} to include sub-section (d)(2)(B)(ii)), which is aimed at combatting [[typosquatting]].  --&gt;

==Prior history==
===UDRP complaint===
In October 2003, Falwell submitted a complaint to the [[National Arbitration Forum]] (NAF), in accordance with [[ICANN]]'s [[Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP), requesting that the domain name be transferred from Lamparello to Falwell.  

Under the UDRP, the complainant must show that the registered domain name is identical or confusingly similar to their trademark, that the registrant has no legitimate interest in the domain name, and that the domain name is being used in bad faith.

The NAF panel decided 2-1 on November 20, 2003 to transfer the domain name to Falwell's ministries, Liberty Alliance.

The dissenting panelist, David E. Sorkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sork.com/domain/ |title=David E. Sorkin - Domain Name Disputes |publisher=Sork.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100105232543/http%3A//www.sork.com/domain/ |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the domain name was not used in bad faith, and that this dispute was not one to be resolved under the UDRP or by the NAF.&lt;ref name="NAFDecision"/&gt;

====Related case:  jerryfalwell.com====
A contemporaneous case was one concerning Gary Cohn and the domain names jerryfalwell.com and jerryfallwell.com.  Falwell sued Cohn for "reverse domain name hijacking", but the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] did not accept the case since Falwell did not have a trademark on his own name.&lt;ref name="WIPO"/&gt;  After Falwell threatened to sue in Virginia, U.S. in 2003, Cohn surrendered both domain names.&lt;ref name="Cohn-FF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohn-VA"/&gt;

===District Court===
Following the NAF decision, Lamparello filed an action against Falwell in federal district court, seeking declaratory judgment of non-infringement.&lt;ref name="Complaint2003"/&gt;  Lamparello was supported by the [[Public Citizen Litigation Group]].&lt;ref name="PCLGBrief"/&gt;  The ACLU also provided an [[amicus brief]], arguing that the domain name in question was protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="ACLUAmicusBrief"/&gt;

Falwell filed a counterclaim, alleging trademark infringement under {{UnitedStatesCode|15|1114}} (2000), false designation origin under {{UnitedStatesCode|15|1125(a)}}, unfair competition under {{UnitedStatesCode|15|1126}} and the common law of the state of Virginia, and cybersquatting under {{UnitedStatesCode|15|1125(d)}}.

The District Court granted summary judgment for Falwell, blocking Lamparello from using the domain name and ordered the transfer of the website to Falwell.  The court denied Falwell's request for statutory damages and attorney fees.

==Opinion of the Court==
Lamparello appealed the District Court's order and Falwell cross-appealed the denial of statutory damages and attorney fees.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit unanimously reversed the District Court's decision, ruling that Lamparello could continue maintaining the gripe website at fallwell.com.  The court reasoned as follows:

;Likelihood of Confusion
:The Court used the 4th Circuit's seven part test for likelihood of confusion: "(a) the strength or distinctiveness of the mark; (b) the similarity of the two marks; (c) the similarity of the goods/services the marks identify; (d) the similarity of the facilities the two parties use in their businesses; (e) the similarity of the advertising used by the two parties; (f) the defendant’s intent; (g) actual confusion."&lt;ref name="AppealOpinion"/&gt;

:In applying this test, the Appeals Court found that there was only a similarity in the online marks, but nothing else was applicable, and that "Lamparello clearly created his website intending only to provide a forum to criticize ideas, not to steal customers."&lt;ref name="AppealOpinion"/&gt;

:The Court of Appeals stressed that there was no confusion that Lamparello's site was not affiliated with Falwell or his ministries.

:&lt;blockquote&gt;After even a quick glance at the content of the website at &lt;nowiki&gt;www.fallwell.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;, no one seeking Reverend Falwell’s guidance would be misled by the domain name — &lt;nowiki&gt;www.fallwell.com&lt;/nowiki&gt; — into believing Reverend Falwell authorized the content of that website. No one would believe that Reverend Falwell sponsored a site criticizing himself, his positions, and his interpretations of the Bible.&lt;ref name="AppealOpinion"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Initial Interest Confusion
:This argument is roughly a [[typosquatting]] argument, wherein legitimate potential customers seeking Falwell's website might misspell his official domain name and instead go to fallwell.com, giving Lamparello an "unearned audience".  The Appeals Court states that there must be a financial profit from the initial interest confusion, and in the case of noncommercial gripe sites, there is no way to financially profit from the confusion.  "This critical element — use of another firm’s mark to capture the markholder’s customers and profits — simply does not exist when the alleged infringer establishes a gripe site that criticizes the markholder."&lt;ref name="AppealOpinion"/&gt;

;Cybersquatting
:In order to win a cybersquatting claim, Falwell would have to show bad faith intent to profit from using the fallwell.com domain name, and prove that the domain name is "identical or confusingly similar to, or dilutive of, the distinctive and famous mark".&lt;ref name="AppealOpinion"/&gt;  In addition to the already established lack of confusion, the Appeals Court found that Lamparello did not have a bad faith intent to profit due to the lack of income from the site, that Lamparello had not attempted to sell the domain name, and that Lamparello had not purchased a large quantity of domain names.&lt;ref group="NB" name="CommentIsOk"/&gt;

:Finally, agreeing with prior cases in the Fifth and Sixth Circuits, "the use of a mark in a domain name for a gripe site criticizing the markholder does not constitute cybersquatting."&lt;ref name="AppealOpinion"/&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
On April 17, 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] declined to hear an appeal from Falwell regarding the 4th Circuit opinion, giving no reasons for declining.&lt;ref name="SupremeCourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SupremeCourt2"/&gt;

As of August 2018, the website is no longer functioning. The last archival snapshot of the site was taken in February 2012, implying that it went down later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/fallwell.com|title=Wayback Machine|website=web.archive.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
In contrast to the Court of Appeals' 2001 opinion in ''People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court
|litigants =People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney
|vol= 263
|reporter= F.3d
|opinion= 359
|court=4th Cir.

|url= http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/263/263.F3d.359.00-2289.00-1918.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court affirmed the District Court's judgment against the defendant, this case supported the defendant, ruling against one gripe site and for the other.  In ''PETA'', the parody website's content was not conveyed simultaneously with the message that the site was peta.org.  In short, the Fourth Circuit backtracked on its decision in ''PETA'', justifying the different opinions as a distinction between parody and consumer confusion.&lt;ref name="katyal"/&gt;  Additionally, in both ''PETA'' and ''Lamparello'', the website in question had links to items for sale.  The distinction between the two cases may have been that in ''PETA'', the defendant registered numerous other websites for [[cybersquatting]] purposes.&lt;ref name="lipton"/&gt;  The utilization of the bad-faith factors of the [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act|ACPA]] has been criticized by some scholars for leading to counterintuitive results when applied to cases that are not clear-cut [[cybersquatting]].&lt;ref name="lipton"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps the Court of Appeals has created a lesson here for counsel representing parties who might assert cyber squatting claims. Before filing suit, initiate bad faith settlement negotiations, for the purpose of obtaining a statement from the cyber squatter that he might be willing to settle. Then, file suit under the ACPA, asserting that your opponent's willingness to engage in your bad faith settlement negotiations demonstrates a bad faith intent to profit on his part.&lt;ref name="TLJ"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This opinion is important when considering [[typosquatting]] and [[gripe site]]s as it upheld Fifth and Sixth Circuit decisions that "the use of a mark in a domain name for a gripe site criticizing the markholder does not constitute cybersquatting."&lt;ref name="AppealOpinion"/&gt;  This opinion contained direct analysis of application of the [[Initial Interest Confusion]] doctrine, but leaves questions regarding the IIC unanswered.&lt;ref name="goldmanblog"/&gt;

&lt;ref group="NB" name="CommentIsOk"&gt;Referencing the ACPA, the Appeals Court also stressed that the ACPA does not limit domain names used for the purposes of noncommercial commentary. From the 4th Circuit Opinion:  "Factor IV of the ACPA, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1) (B)(i)(IV), counsels against finding a bad faith intent to profit in such circumstances because "use of a domain name for purposes of . . . comment, [and] criticism," H.R. Rep. No. 106-412, 1999 WL 970519, at *11, constitutes a "bona fide noncommercial or fair use" under the statute, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IV)."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="115496">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of music biographies in Rees's ''Cyclopaedia''}}
The music articles in [[Rees's Cyclopaedia|Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'']] were written by [[Charles Burney]] (1726–1814), with additional material by [[John Farey, sr]] (1766–1826), and [[John Farey, Jr]] (1791–1851), and illustrated by 53 plates as well a numerous examples of music typset within the articles.

Charles Burney was well known as the author of a ''General History of Music'', 4 vol 1776–1789 and two travel diaries recording his Musical Tours collecting information in France and Italy, and later Germany, 1+2 vol, 1771 and 1773, as well as the ''Commemoration of Handel'', 1785 and his ''Musical Memoirs of Metastasio'', 1796. John Farey, sr was a polymath, well known today for his work as a geologist and for his investigations of the mathematics of sound, and the schemes of temperamant used in tuning musical instruments then. His son, John Farey, jr, was also polymathic in his interests. He contributed numerous drawings for the illustrations of mostly technological and scientific topics in Rees's Cyclopaedia.

Burney's music biographies range from antiquity to the first decade of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipking|first1=Lawrence|title=The Ordering of the Arts in Eighteenth-Century England|date=1970|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=318–319|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote 756 articles, and while great number of the names, such as Mozart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldman|first1=C. B.|title=Dr Burney and Mozart|journal=Mozart Jahrbuch|date=1964|volume=1962/63|pages=75–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; were featured in his earlier writings,  others are unique to the ''Cyclopaedia''. These mainly concern minor London musicians and singers, whom Burney had known personally in his young days. Some are known through modern reference books, but others, often with only surname, only have their memory recorded in the pages of the ''Cyclopaedia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lonsdale|first1=Roger|title=Dr Charles Burney|date=1965|publisher=Oxford: The Clarendon Press|page=412|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few cases Burney has anglicised Christian names — John Frederick Reichardt, instead of Johann Friedrich, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Rees's Cyclopaedia, vol 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In his biographies Burney mirrored the ''Lives of the Poets'' by Samuel Johnson, namely: a short summary of the subject's reputation, with a summary of his career, a list of his works and an account of his genius and his contribution to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackerness|first1=E. D.|title=Dr Burney, Biographer|journal=Contemporary Review|date=1956|volume=CLXXXIX [189]|pages=352–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lonsdale has commented that a handful of Burney biographical articles are misplaced in the alphabetical sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Lonsdale, Roger, 'Dr Burney's 'Dictionary of Music' ',''Musicology Australia'', vol. 5, no. 1, p.&amp;nbsp; 162, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; These occur mostly under the letter A, and were missed in the early stages of writing, when Burney was trying to overtake the press, for he did not start composing the texts until the summer of 1801, when the work was already underway. One, [[Jacques Arcadelt|Jacques Arkadelt]] in Vol 2, appears twice, as Giacomo Arkadelt in Vol, 16 where he is listed in the middle of the Gs, but with a shorter article.

'''ALPHABETISATION OF ARTICLES'''

The work followed the common practice of conflating the letters I and J and U and V into single sequences. The topics included in this list therefore follow the sequence they appear in the original volumes.

'''ANNOTATION'''

The articles are annotated to [[Frank Mercer (writer on music)|Mercer]]'s edition of Burney's ''History'' (1935) and [[Percy Scholes|Scholes]]'s edition of Burney's ''Travels'' (1959). Where a page reference is given the text can be found there. Where a book is cited, but with no page, index entries were found, and Burney is presumed to have written his article using the information there. Where there is no annotation, the article must be unique to the ''Cyclopaedia''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2221">One of the most famous lost mines in [[California]] is known as the Lost Dutch Oven mine. There are several versions of the story, as is the case with most lost mine legends; perhaps the best known is the one with Tom Schofield, a railroad worker, decided to do some prospecting in his time off. According to this version, while prospecting in the [[Clipper Mountains]], northwest of [[Essex, San Bernardino County, California|Essex]] (in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino county]]), he found an old stone house. As the house appeared to be long abandoned, he continued on. Several miles further in his travels he found a spring. Near the spring he spotted an old trail. Following the trail, it led him up over a hill where he spotted a huge boulder that was split in two. The path went through this split boulder, and into what he believed was an ancient Spanish camp.

While looking through the deserted camp, he found pieces of ore and an old rusted Dutch Oven, the latter of which he tripped over in his search. As he tripped, he caused the Dutch Oven to tip, spilling out handfuls of gold nuggets. Schofield filled his pockets with as much gold as he could carry and went back to "civilization" where he celebrated his good fortune in the old-fashioned way.

The upshot of the story is, Schofield, on having celebrated up all of his gold, returned to the Clipper mountains to get more gold and could not find the mine again. He could not even find the trail. Others have sought this mine unsuccessfully over the years, as Schofield gave enough details in the topography that it seems as if it would be easy to find it again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.desertusa.com/mb3/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=1939 | title=DesertUSA Forum | date=May 25, 2010 | accessdate=June 19, 2014 | author=oroblanco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ca-lostmines.html#Dutch Oven Mine of San Bernardino County | title=California Legends: Lost Mines of California | publisher=Legends of America | accessdate=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Masterpiece''''' is a [[board game]] by [[Parker Brothers]], now a [[brand]] of [[Hasbro]].  Players participate in auctions for famous works of art. It was invented by Joseph M. Burck of [[Marvin Glass and Associates]] and originally published in [[1970 in games|1970]] by Parker Brothers, and then published again in 1976 and 1996. The game is now out-of-print.  In this game, players compete with other players to bid on potentially valuable [[paintings]], and negotiate with other players to trade these works of art, build a portfolio, amass money, and win the game. The top value of a painting in the 1970 edition is $1 million, and $10 million in the 1996 edition; however, getting the full value for the painting requires some luck in landing on the right square on the board to sell a painting to the bank.

The game utilizes bluffing skills because the players possess [[asymmetrical information]] about the value of the paintings they possess.  Some pictures are known to their owners to be 'forgeries' with an actual value of zero.  These 'forgeries' can, however, be resold to other players or to the bank with the value hidden.

==Versions==
===Original U.S. Release (1970)===
# The game box is in English only.
# A green-backed game board
# Play money with denominations colored in gray($50,000), yellow($100,000), brown($500,000), and olive green($1,000,000).
# The play money says “Masterpiece” on the top and the value on the bottom.
# There are 24 Value cards ranging in value from $0 (forgery) to $1,000,000.
# There are 6 Value Chart cards with both a list of the available values in the Value card deck, as well as the bios of the characters seen on the box front. (These cards are the same size as the Value cards.)
# There are 24 Painting cards (sized measuring 14&amp;nbsp;cm x 9&amp;nbsp;cm (5.5” x 3.5”)) that contain paintings on display at the [[National Gallery]] in London, England, such as [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s ''[[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|Sunflowers]]'', [[Paul Cézanne]]’s ''Aix: Paysage Rocheux'', [[Leonardo da Vinci]]’s ''[[The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist]]'', [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]'s ''Les Parapluies'' and [[Claude-Oscar Monet]]’s ''The Beach at Trouville''.

===Canadian Release (1970)===
Differs by:
# The game box has slightly darker tones and richer colors, with both English and French on the cover.
# The game board has a dark brown backing (the front is the same as the standard version)
# The play money has denominations colored in yellow($50,000), brown($100,000), olive($500,000, and blue($1,000,000).
# The play money has English on the bottom and French on the top (for example: One Million and Un Million).  The word “Masterpiece” is not written on the play money.
# The Value Chart cards have no character bios on them.

===Release (1976)===
Differs from Original by:
# The box color now sported a green-tinged motif.
# The box art shows talking paintings replacing the art auction characters.
# The Value Chart cards have no character bios on them.
# A completely different painting card set featuring paintings on display at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].  Paintings include such works as [[Hans Hofmann]]’s ''The Golden Wall'', [[Peter Blume]]’s ''The Rock'', [[Edward Hopper]]’s ''[[Nighthawks]]'', [[Grant Wood]]’s ''[[American Gothic]]'', [[Vincent van Gogh]]’s ''Self Portrait'' and [[Pablo Picasso]]’s ''Sylvette (Portrait of Mlle. D.)''

===Release (1996)===
differs from Original by:
# The box cover brought back the concept of art auction characters (featuring a rather surprised blonde lady surrounded by a variety of other characters) with a red-tinged background.
# The Value Chart cards have no character bios on them but a box insert discusses each of the art collector characters in detail.
# The play money has much higher denominations, with denominations of $500,000, $1,000,000, $5,000,000, and $10,000,000.
# The Value cards reduced in size to 7.5cm x 4.5 cm (3” x 1.8”) and increased in number from 24 to 42 with the top value at $10,000,000.
# A plastic art display easel was included to aid in the auctioning process.
# The Painting cards remain the same size as previous editions, but feature different paintings from the Art Institute of Chicago, such as [[Paul Cézanne]]’s ''The Basket of Apples'', [[Edward Hopper]]’s ''[[Nighthawks]]'', [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]’s ''Violet and Silver – The Deep Sea'', [[Paul Gauguin]]’s ''Old Women of Arles'', and Vincent van Gogh’s ''[[Bedroom in Arles]].''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2702">The '''Minkus catalogue''' was a comprehensive catalogue of [[United States|American]] and worldwide [[postage stamps]], edited by George A Tlamsa and published by [[Krause Publications]]. In the United States Minkus competed with the [[Scott catalogue]] as a distant second. Generally sold through department store stamp collecting departments, it had its own system of numbering stamps which was used in its catalogues and stamp albums; Scott's numbering system is proprietary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Vries|first=Lloyd|title=The Stamp Collecting report|url=http://www.virtualstampclub.com/radiostuff/990123.html|accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minkus catalogue and numbering system was acquired by [[Amos Press]] in 2004 and no further editions were published. The last US catalog was the ''2004 Krause-Minkus Standard Catalog of U.S. Stamps''.

The Minkus catalogues had more extensive information about the subjects of stamps, a short paragraph about the subject portrayed on the stamp, than the Scott catalogue, which has only a name or brief sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stamp Collecting|last=Datz|first=Stephen R.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999|publisher=General Philatelic Corporation|location=Loveland, Colorado|isbn=0-88219-030-X|page=33|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as 1974 a two-volume hardbound ''Minkus New World-Wide Postage Stamp Catalog'' was published, Volume 1 covering the United States and the British Commonwealth ran to 2004 pages in 1974, Volume 2, covering Europe and the rest of the world was slightly smaller, running to 1292 pages in 1973. A series of specialized paperbound catalogues such as the ''Krause-Minkus Standard Catalog of Canadian &amp; United Nations Stamps'', ''Krause-Minkus Standard Catalog of Australia Stamps: 2001 : Listings 1948-1999'' (Global Stamp Series), and the ''Krause-Minkus Standard Catalog of Israel Stamps 2001 Edition, Listings 1948-1999 A fully illustrated collector's catalog for the postage stamps of Israel'' {{ISBN|0-87341-960-X}} were published at least until 2001.

Minkus albums included the multi-volume Supreme or Master Global Stamp Album, a comprehensive worldwide album; country albums; and albums for American collectors; supplements were published until at least 2003 and are available on the after-market, e.g. eBay.&lt;ref&gt;eBay search January 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5663">'''Mold prevention''' is a conservation activity that is performed in libraries to protects books and
other materials from deterioration caused by mold growth. [[Mold]] prevention consists of
different methods, such as chemical treatments, careful environmental control, and manual
cleaning. Preservationists use one or a combination of these methods to combat mold spores in library collections.

Due to its resilient nature, mold prevention has become an important activity among [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] librarians. Mold reproduces by releasing spores into the air. It becomes active after being in a dormant state and responds to fluctuating temperature, air flow, and humidity within the surrounding environment. Library holdings have been deemed vulnerable since mold digests paper and other organic materials that collection items consist of. Moisture in the atmosphere contributes to irreparable damage caused by mold growth.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Whitney. "Preservation Perspectives: Mold in the Stacks: A Universal Problem. ''Kentucky Libraries.'' 65(3)(Summer 2001):20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical treatment==
Preservation librarians use a number of different chemicals to prevent the growth of mold spores. Chemical compounds such as [[ethylene oxide]], [[thymol]], and [[2-Phenylphenol|orthophenyl phenol]] are regularly used.&lt;ref&gt;Southwell, Kristina L. "The Use of Chlorine Dioxide as a Mold Treatment and its Effect on Paper Acidity: a case study." ''The Journal of Academic Librarianship.'' 28(6) (2002): 400-405.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Chlorine dioxide]] is a chemical that is growing in popularity due its safety level for library employees and patrons. These chemicals act as effective sporicides in a variety of library settings. They are applied on books and surrounding shelves by manual wiping or using chlorine packets that release the chemicals in gaseous form into the air.&lt;ref&gt;Southwell, Kristina L. "Chlorine Dioxide: a treatment for mold in libraries." ''Archival Products.'' 10(3) (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical treatments are often used in enclosed storage areas with little air circulation. They are also used to deal with emergency situations involving mold outbreaks caused by pipe leaks in buildings. In 2000, the [[University of Oklahoma]] Libraries conducted an evaluation of the effects of chlorine packets on mold growth. Paper items that had been exposed to the substance showed lower overall [[pH]] levels than items that had not been treated. Although long-term effects of chemical treatments on paper [[Print permanence|permanence]] and other library materials have not been documented, libraries use this newer method of controlling mold in the stacks.&lt;ref&gt;Southwell, Kristina L. "The Use of Chlorine Dioxide as a Mold Treatment and Its Effect on Paper Acidity: a case study." ''The Journal of Academic Librariansip.'' 28(6) (2002): 400-405.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental control==

Many libraries monitor a building's atmosphere through the use of [[HVAC]] systems. These built in
ventilation systems help to combat mold growth that occurs as a result of high [[relative humidity]]
levels and temperature, as well poor air circulation. Proper use and monitoring of HVAC systems can help to prevent mold problems before they occur. Air ventilation removes existing mold spores from the air and keeps the atmosphere relatively dry and cool. Effective HVAC systems have good system design as well as the ability to provide environmental control over entire building areas. They should also be well maintained and be up to date with new technology.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Dors R. "Collection Disaster: Mold in the Stacks." ''College &amp; Research Libraries News.'' 64(5) (2003):304-306.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manual solutions===

Manual methods such as [[HEPA]] filtered vacuuming serve as a backup to eliminating mold via environmental control. HEPA vacuums possess air filters that do not allow mold to be spread into the air again. Installing drying fans, dry wiping books and surrounding furniture, as well as air ducts and shelves also help to prevent further infestations. In extreme cases, some books and items are discarded to protect the rest of the collection from being affected. These preservation activities are provided by available library staff or hired contractors.&lt;ref&gt;Alleman, Steve. "Coping with an Outbreak of Mold." ''LLA Bulletin.'' 61(4) (Spring 1999):217-220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative methods==

[[Freeze drying]] or [[ultraviolet light]] exposure are other ways to inhibit mold growth, although they do not kill mold spores permanently. Eliminating mold through these methods is challenging due to paper degradation caused by light exposure over time. There are also some mold species that have preferences for colder temperatures. Freezing and UV exposure are used as a temporary means to stop mold from spreading throughout library collections.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Whitney. "Preservation Perspectives: Mold in the Stacks: A Universal Problem." ''Kentucky Libraries.'' 65(3) (Summer 2001): 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mrs. Mary Eales's Receipts''''' was published in [[London]] in 1718 and again in 1733, the second time also under the title of ''The compleat confectioner''. It was published in 1744 with an additional called ''A curious collection of receipts in cookery, pickling, family physick, &amp;c.'' added by the publisher, R. Montagu. (The author of the latter part is unknown.) A facsimile of the 1733 edition was published in 1985 by Prospect Books ({{ISBN|0-907325-25-4}}).

Mrs. Mary Eales is listed on the cover as confectioner to her late Majesty [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]; there is no external verification or disproval of this claim. It was the first [[England|English]] [[cookbook]] to include a [[recipe]] for [[ice cream]]. Many of the recipes are of the form of "To preserve something", or "To dry something", with many of the rest being recipes for creams, jams, jellies, or pastes, with the occasional chip, cake or biscuit recipe. The 1733 edition has 126 recipes and is exactly 100 pages long, plus the title page and table of contents.

Two of the 126 recipes in the 1733 edition:

:'''To ice CREAM.'''

:Take Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweeten'd, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top: You must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch; but the Ice must lie round them on every Side; lay a good deal of Ice on the Top, cover the Pail with Straw, set it in a Cellar where no Sun or Light comes, it will be froze in four Hours, but it may stand longer; than take it out just as you use it; hold it in your Hand and it will slip out. When you wou'd freeze any Sort of Fruit, either Cherries, Raspberries, Currants, or Strawberries, fill your Tin-Pots with the Fruit, but as hollow as you can; put to them Lemmonade, made with Spring-Water and Lemmon-Juice sweeten'd; put enough in the Pots to make the Fruit hang together, and put them in Ice as you do Cream.

:'''To dry GOOSBERRIES.'''

:Take the large white Goosberries before they are very ripe, but at full Growth, stone and wash them, and to a Pound of Goosberries put a Pound and half of Sugar, beat very fine, and half a Pint of Water; set them on the Fire; when the Sugar is melted, let them boil, but not too fast; take them off once or twice, that they may not break; when they begin to look clear, they are enough: Let them stand all Night in the Pan they are boil'd in, with a Paper laid close to them; the next Day scald them very well, and let them stand a Day or two; then lay them on Plates, sift them with Sugar very well, and put them in the Stove, turning them every Day 'till they are dry; the third Time of turning, you may lay them on a Sieve, if you please; when they are pretty dry, place them in a Box, with Paper betwixt every Row.

Tier 2 servers are operated by community volunteers across a multitude of geographic locations.

Like all [[Alternative DNS root|alternative root DNS systems]], OpenNIC-hosted domains are unreachable to the vast majority of [[Internet]] users, because they require a non-default configuration in one's [[Domain Name System|DNS resolver]].

== History ==
On June 1, 2000, an article was posted on [[Kuro5hin|kuro5hin.org]] advocating a democratically governed [[domain name system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2000/7/16/12039/2519|title=kuro5hin.org|last=|first=|date=|website=www.kuro5hin.org|publisher=|archive-url=http://wiki.opennic.org/opennic:faq#how_did_opennic_start|archive-date=November 26, 2007|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first OpenNIC servers went into operation July of that year.

==== New Nations ====
[[New Nations]] provides TLDs for [[Nation state|nation-states]] that are not recognized by the [[ISO 3166-1]] [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|alpha-2]] standard, and therefore haven't received their own [[Country code top-level domain|ccTLD]]. Currently they provide [[Kurdish people|.ku]] (''Kurdish people''), [[Tamil Eelam|.te]] (''Tamil Eelam''), [[Tibet|.ti]] (''Tibet''), and [[Uyghur people|.uu]] (''Uyghur people'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://new-nations.net/|title=new-nations|website=new-nations.net|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== FurNIC ====
[[FurNIC]] aims to bring a unique identity to [[Furry fandom|Furries]], Furry Fandom, and other [[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphic]] interest websites across the internet. FurNIC and OpenNIC work closely, with [[Furry fandom|.fur]] (''Furry fandom'') generally being treated as part of OpenNIC for most purposes, rather than a separate peer entity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Namecoin ====
OpenNIC resolves .[[Namecoin|bit]] (''[[Namecoin]]'') domains through the use of a centralized server which generates a DNS zone from the Namecoin [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bit.namecoin.org/|title=Dot-Bit: Secure Decentralized DNS|website=bit.namecoin.org|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access is provided through a [[DNS root zone|Tier 1 server]] which [[Bridging (networking)|bridges]] the OpenNIC system and Namecoin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.opennic.org/opennic:dot:bit|title=.bit TLD|last=|first=|date=|website=OpenNIC Wiki|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some OpenNIC DNS servers make use of a [[Spamhaus]]-maintained blacklist of malicious .bit domains.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.opennic.org/api/blacklist&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://lists.opennicproject.org/sympa/arc/discuss/2017-08/msg00019.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://api.opennicproject.org/acl/filter/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Emercoin ====
On January 15, 2015, domains registered in Emercoin's [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]] became accessible to all users of OpenNIC DNS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emercoin.com/2015-01-15-Emercoin_Reaches_Peering_Agreement_with_OpenNIC|title=Emercoin reaches peering agreement with OpenNIC|last=Emercoin|website=emercoin.com|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emercoin DNS supports the domain zones .coin, .emc, .lib and .bazar. However, Emercoin DNS records can be registered/maintained from within the Emercoin software, and not as part of OpenNIC's management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emercoin.com/EMCDNS_and_NVS|title=Emercoin DNS|last=Emercoin|website=emercoin.com|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technical zones ===
OpenNIC operates some special-use TLDs, which are meant for technical or organizational purposes.

[[Image:Plattmakers screenshot.png|thumb|Example of a Plattmakers entry (the word ''Schruuv'' [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[screw]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;])]]
'''Plattmakers''' is a [[Low German|Low Saxon]] [[online dictionary]] project. With more than 18,500 word entries (as of August 2013) it is one of the most extensive Low Saxon online dictionaries. As each word entry can be rendered in several different Low Saxon varieties its effectively the most extensive Low Saxon dictionary available.

==History==

Plattmakers was created in 2009.

==Features==

The most prominent feature of the dictionary is the fact that its entries are stored in a special notation that allows to render them in different ways. The Low Saxon language has no fixed [[Orthography|orthographic standard]] and each region differs in the way words are written down and spoken.

The Plattmakers notation stores the word's linguistic features as present at around 700 AD. 700 AD was the time the latest common predecessor was spoken from which all modern Low Saxon dialects developed. The string is then processed by a rendering engine that applies any relevant [[sound shift]]s since then in chronological order and thus produces a phonological representation of the modern word. This representation is processed by a second rendering engine that applies modern orthography to the string. The software is thus able to reproduce any word in any dialect and orthography.

The dictionary provides Low Saxon annotations to the Low Saxon words and beside that also gives translations of the words into [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. The interface is available in Low Saxon, English, German and Dutch.

The site divides the Low Saxon [[language area]] into 128 subdivisions. For each of them a custom renderer is planned. The site also collects information on the area each word is used in and thus allows to distinguish words of general use from words only in regional use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3410">A '''project agreement''' is an agreement between the owner/developer of a [[construction project]] and the construction trade unions that will perform that construction work.  A project agreement modifies the terms of otherwise applicable construction [[collective agreement]]s for purposes of a specific construction project or a defined set of construction projects.  Without exception, Project Agreements provide that there will be no [[strike action|strike]]s or [[lockout (industry)|lockouts]] on the covered construction project or projects, thereby removing a significant source of [[risk]] to the owner/developers of these projects.  Project agreements typically replicate the principal economic terms of the otherwise applicable construction collective agreements, although there may be specific modifications to those terms.

[[Labour relations]] statutes in most Canadian jurisdictions contain provisions that specifically allow for the negotiation of project agreements.  This is in contrast with the United States (see Project Labor Agreements) where there is no specific provisions pertaining to project labor agreements in the National Labor Relations Act.  In [[Ontario]], the Conservative Government amended the [[Labour Relations Act]] (Bill 139) to facilitate the adoption of Project Agreements that cover multiple projects as well as projects initiated subsequent to the commencement of a Project Agreement.

The Canadian statutory tradition of supporting and facilitating project agreements has led to their adoption in a wide range of circumstances in both the [[Public sector|public]] and [[private sector]].  Major construction projects that were completed under the terms of project agreements include: various private sector industrial projects (e.g., Hudson Bay Mining Improvement Project in [[Flin Flon]], Tembec Paper Mill Expansion in [[Powerview-Pine Falls, Manitoba|Pine Falls]], and Co-op Oil Refinery in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]]), major public sector projects (Highway 407 Construction in Ontario, [[Confederation Bridge]] project in [[Prince Edward Island]], and multiple projects undertaken by various provincial hydro-electric authorities.) Had the City of [[Toronto]] won its bid to host the Olympics, construction related to the Olympics would have been carried out under the terms of a Project Agreement.

Governments, in their capacity as owner/developers of construction projects, have used project agreements to secure training and employment opportunities for groups that might otherwise not have access to skilled construction work.  For example, the Project Agreement governing the construction of the [[Vancouver Island Highway]] provided for explicit [[Employment equity (Canada)|employment equity]] hiring focused on women and members of [[First Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Griffin Cohen and Kate Braid, "Training and Equity Initiatives on the British Columbia Vancouver Island Highway Project: A Model For Large-Scale Construction Projects”, Labor Studies Journal, Vol. 25, No. 3, 70–103 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Red Hot Riding Hood''''' is an [[animated cartoon]] [[short subject]], directed by [[Tex Avery]] and released with the movie ''Dr. Gillespie's Criminal Case'' on May 8, 1943 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. In 1994, it was voted #7 of [[The 50 Greatest Cartoons]] of all time by members of the animation field, making it the highest ranked MGM cartoon on the list. It is one of Avery's most popular cartoons, inspiring several of his own "sequel" shorts as well as influencing other cartoons and feature films for years afterward.

==Plot==
The story begins with the standard version of ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' (with the wolf from ''[[Dumb-Hounded]]'', the cartoon which saw the debut of Avery's [[Droopy]]). [[Fourth wall|The characters rebel]] at this stale and derivative staging of the story and demand a fresh approach. The annoyed narrator accedes to their demands and starts the story again in a dramatically different arrangement.

The story begins again, now told in a [[contemporary]] [[Urban area|urban]] setting. The narrator explains that Little Red Riding Hood (now portrayed as an adult) is [[Exotic dancer|an attractive performer]] in a [[Hollywood]] [[nightclub]] under the [[stage name]] "Red Hot Riding Hood," and [[Big Bad Wolf#MGM/Tex Avery's Big Bad Wolf|the Big Bad Wolf]], now a Hollywood swinger, follows Red to the club where she is performing. Red performs onstage (a rendition of the 1941 classic hit song "[[Daddy (Sammy Kaye song)|Daddy]]" by [[Bobby Troup]]) and the wolf goes mad with desire. He brings her to his table and tries wooing her, but she wants nothing to do with him. Red escapes the Wolf, saying she is going to her [[Apartment|Grandma's place]], but nevertheless the Wolf manages to get there first. Grandma's place is a penthouse at the top of a skyscraper.  Red's grandma is an oversexed man-chaser [[Love at first sight|who falls head over heels for the Wolf]] (upon seeing him, she whistles and says, "At last, a wolf! Yahoo!").

The Wolf tries to escape, but Grandma blocks the exit and asks him, "What's your hurry, hairy?" She locks the door, drops the key down the front of her [[evening gown]], and poses provocatively for him. She dons a bright red shade of [[lipstick]] and a chase scene ensues.  Whenever the Wolf attempts an exit, Grandma waits behind the door with puckered lips. He finally makes his escape by jumping out a window, severely injuring himself on the pavement many floors below. He makes his way back to the nightclub, covered with bandages and bruises, swearing, "I'm through with women. Why, I'll kill myself before I'd even look at another babe." Immediately Red takes the stage and begins another performance. The Wolf pulls out two guns and commits [[suicide]], but his ghost rises from his dead body and [[Wolf-whistling|howls and whistles]] at Red as he did earlier.

==Characters==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
The character of Red closely resembled one of the top [[pin-up girl]]s at the time, [[Lana Turner]]. She is considered an amalgamation of the then popular Hollywood stars. Her singing voice in this particular short was reminiscent of [[Lena Horne]]'s, while her speaking voice emulated that of [[Katharine Hepburn]].

The two supporting characters are Red's sisters in the entry of the [[nightclub]] foyer, where the Wolf walks in. It is the shortest, who says, "[[Cigarettes]], cigarettes!" And the other is the tallest, who says, "King-sized, king-sized!"

==Censorship==
The most famous element is the musical scene where Red performs and "Wolfie", as she calls him, reacts in highly lustful [[wild take]]s. Those reactions were considered so energetic that the [[censorship|censors]] at the time demanded cuts in this scene and others. Avery claimed that a censor made him edit out footage of the Wolf getting sexually aroused at the sight of Red performing. However, an army officer at [[Washington, D.C.]], then heard about the censored prints and asked [[Louis B. Mayer]] for uncut ones. The print was shown to military audiences overseas and went over great with them.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Preston Blair]] on the other hand, who animated Red, did not recall any cuts to the film. He did recall, however, that the military went nuts over it.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's original conclusion had Grandma marrying the wolf at a [[shotgun wedding]] (with a caricature of [[Tex Avery]] as the Justice of the Peace who marries them), and having the unhappy couple and their half-human half-wolf children attend Red's show.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The chase scene with Grannie and the Wolf ends in the completed film with him jumping out of a window. In the early script, the Wolf crawls back inside and explains that he is about to commit suicide. The chase continues and Red joins the two other characters. The Wolf is tied up and Grannie instructs Red to get a preacher. She then kisses the Wolf. The two get married at a shotgun wedding. The Wolf says "I do" with Red aiming an anti-aircraft gun at his back. The final scene takes place at a nightclub. Grannie and the Wolf attend a performance of Red. Three baby wolves at their table go wild over Red.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; This ending was indeed animated and stills of the wedding scene are included in the MGM photo library. The images were fully inked and painted.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair had his own censorship tale. According to him, the censor was dirty minded and thought the film promoted bestiality between a woman and a wolf. Blair was instructed to animate a new ending, where the wolf's face is torn off as a mask and he is revealed to be a man. He completed the additional footage, though disgusted with the unnecessary censorship. At the end the studio never used this ending and Blair was unaware if the print survived.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

This ending, deleted for reasons of implied [[bestiality]] and how it made light of marriage (something that was considered taboo back in the days of the [[Hays Office]] Code), was replaced with one (that has also been edited, but only on television) where The Wolf is back at the nightclub and tells the audience that he's through with chasing women and if he ever even looks at a woman again, he's going to kill himself. When Red soon appears onstage to perform again, the Wolf takes out two pistols and blasts himself in the head. The Wolf then drops dead, but his ghost appears and begins to howl and whistle at Red same as before.

A rumor surfaced at the 1992 Conference of the Society for Animation Studies, that there was another alternate ending. According to this rumor, Wolf married Red and had a baby with her. Blair declared there was no such sequence. Mark Kausler provided a copy of a continuity script that clarified that Wolf married Grandma and not Red.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Follow-ups==
* Avery made several followups to the film, including ''[[Swing Shift Cinderella]]'' (1945), ''[[The Shooting of Dan McGoo]]'' and ''[[Wild and Woolfy]]'' (both 1945 and starring [[Droopy]]), ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabaña]]'' (1947), and ''[[Little Rural Riding Hood]]'' (1949). Red also appeared in ''Big Heel-Watha'' (1945, as Indian girl Minnie Hot-Cha), and ''The Hick Chick'' (1946, cameo as a nurse at the end of the cartoon). Red's voice actresses included [[Sara Berner]], [[Bea Benaderet]] and [[Imogene Lynn]].

* Red made a comeback in the [[Saturday morning cartoon]] series ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry Kids]]'' and ''[[Droopy, Master Detective]]'' (voiced by [[Teresa Ganzel]]), given the name "Miss Vavoom" in the ''Droopy and Dripple'' shorts and "Mystery Lady" in ''Calaboose Cal''. As in the original MGM cartoons, Red plays the "[[damsel in distress]]" while the Wolf (here "McWolf") and Droopy compete for her affections.

* Red appeared in the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' [[direct-to-video]] movies like ''[[Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes]]'', ''[[Tom and Jerry: Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse]]'', and ''[[Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure]]'' (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]), where she was a primary character to the films' plots; the Wolf also made a few appearances, even becoming her groom in ''Meet Sherlock Holmes''.

* Red made a cameo appearance in the 1998 [[Warner Bros.]] animated film, ''[[Quest for Camelot]]'', where she appeared briefly during the third verse of "If I Didn't Have You" with Cornwall, before she turned into Devon's head.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1326">'''SPECvirt_sc2010''' is a [[computer benchmark]] that evaluates the performance of a [[server computer]] for [[virtualization]]. It is available from the [[Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation]] (SPEC). It was introduced in July, 2010.&lt;ref name=SPECPress&gt;[http://www.spec.org/virt_sc2010/press/release.html SPEC Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPECvirt_sc2010 benchmark measures the maximum number of workloads that a platform can simultaneously run while maintaining specific quality of service metrics.  Each workload, called a tile, consists of a specific set of virtual machines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spec.org/virt_sc2010/docs/SPECvirt_FAQ.html SPECvirt_sc2010 FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to generating results that show performance, the benchmark can also be used to generate performance per watt results.

The SPECvirt_sc2010 was not supported by SPEC from February 26, 2014 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.spec.org/virt_sc2010/ SPECvirt_sc2010 retirement]&lt;/ref&gt; and its successor is SPECvirt_sc2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.spec.org/virt_sc2013/docs/SPECvirt_FAQ.html SPECvirt_sc2013 FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was started whilst he was imprisoned by the Scots in [[Edinburgh Castle]], after being captured in an ambush in October 1355, and completed in England after his release.{{sfn|King|2005b|p=xx}} The chronicle documents the history of [[UK|Britain]] until 1363, and is one of the few early chronicles written by a layman.

==Overview==
The only extant [[Middle Ages|medieval]] manuscript of the ''Scalacronica'' is MS 133 held by [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], where it originally formed part of the bequest of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[Matthew Parker]], a former Master of the College and a collector of manuscripts. During the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the antiquary [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] prepared an abstract of the ''Scalacronica'' which he included in his ''Collectanea''. This abstract has proven useful as the original manuscript currently lacks part of the material for the years 1339 and 1356, and all the material from 1340 to 1355, the years in which the author himself had direct experience of events. In addition, at some time before 1567, [[Nicholas Wotton]], [[Dean of Canterbury]], made numerous extracts from the ''Salacronica'' (BL MS Harley 902). No complete edition of the original manuscript of the ''Salacronica'' has been published, although an edition published in Edinburgh in 1836 (edited by [[Joseph Stevenson]] for the [[Maitland Club]]) contains the text dealing with the period after the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Archer|1890}}; {{Harvnb|Maxwell|1907|pp=viii-x}}; {{Harvnb|King|2005|p=57}}; {{Harvnb|Thiolier|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the ''Scalacronica'' is not only an allusion to one of its principal sources, the [[Polychronicon]] of [[Ranulf Higden]] but also a pun on Grey’s surname, as the Norman French word ''gree'' meant ‘step' or ' stair’, as did the Latin ''scala'', and the title could thus be translated as the ‘Scaling-Ladder Chronicle’, the ladder being a Grey family badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Archer|1890}}; {{Harvnb|Maxwell|1907|pp=viii-x}}; {{Harvnb|King|2005|p=57}}; {{Harvnb|Thiolier|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[allegory|allegorical]] [[prologue]] to the ''Scalacronica'', Grey relates a dream in which [[Thomas of Otterbourne]] holds a five-runged ladder, the symbolism of which is explained by a [[sibyl]]. The first four rungs represent the four historians, [[Walter of Oxford]], [[Bede]], [[Ranulf Higden]] and [[John of Tynemouth (chronicler)|John of Tynemouth]], whose work is to be the inspiration for the first four parts of the book, while the fifth rung represents the future. However, as King notes, although the prologue sets out a plan for a history of Britain, the ''Scalacronica'' is a universal chronicle from the creation of the world which includes summaries of the histories of Israel, Troy, and Rome, and within each part chronicles events not only in England and Scotland, but also in Rome, Germany, France, and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Archer|1890}}; {{Harvnb|Maxwell|1907|pp=viii-x}}; {{Harvnb|King|2005|p=57}}; {{Harvnb|Thiolier|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The chief historical value of the work is in the parts dealing with the reigns of King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], and King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] which draw on the personal experience of both the author and his father, also [[Thomas Grey (of Heaton)|Thomas Grey]], as soldiers in the Anglo-Scottish and French wars during those reigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maxwell|1907|p=ix}}; {{Harvnb|Archer|1890}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10822">A '''service catalog''' (or '''catalogue'''), is an organized and curated collection of any and all business and [[information technology]] related services that can be performed by, for, or within an enterprise.

Service catalogs act as knowledge management tools for the employees and consultants of an enterprise, allowing them to route their requests for and about services and services related topics to the subject matter experts who own, are accountable for, and operate them.  Each service within such service catalogs is usually very repeatable and has controlled inputs, processes, and outputs.

Service catalogs also allow leadership and management, for example the Chief Operations Officer (COO), to compartmentalize the enterprise into highly structured and more efficient operational units, hence the descriptive phrase: "''a service-oriented enterprise''."

== Service centralization ==
A service catalog is a means of centralizing all services that are important to the stakeholders of the enterprises which implement and use it.  Given its digital and virtual implementation, via software, the service catalog acts, at a minimum, as a digital registry and a means for highly distributed enterprises to see, find, invoke, and execute services regardless of where they exist in the world.  This means that people in one part of the world can find and utilize the same services that people in other parts of the world use, eliminating the need to develop and support local services via a federated implementation model.&lt;ref name=Service_Federation&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Camarinha-Matos|first1=L. M.|last2=Afsarmanesh|first2=H.|last3=Kaletas|first3=E.|last4=Cardoso|first4=T.|title=Service Federation in Virtual Organizations|journal=Digital Enterprise Challenges|date=January 2002|volume=77|pages=305–324|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-35492-7_29|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-35492-7_29|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centralizing services also acts as a means of identifying service gaps and redundancies that can then be addressed by the enterprise to improve itself.

== Service catalog composition ==
Service catalogs are implemented in a manner that facilitate the registration, discovery, request, execution, and tracking of desired services for catalog users.  Each service within the catalog typically includes traits and elements such as:

* Clear ownership of and accountability for the service (a person and often an organization)
* A name or identification label for the service
* A description of the service
* A service categorization or type that allows it to be grouped with other similar services
* Related service request types
* Any supporting or underpinning services
* Service level agreement (SLA) data and information that helps service providers set expectations for their service requestors
* Who is entitled to request/view the service
* Associated costs (if any)
* How to request the service and how its delivery is fulfilled
* Escalation points and key contacts

The more descriptive the service details are, the easier it is for end users of the service catalog to find and invoke the services they desire.

== Catalog categories ==
A service catalog is commonly structured in a manner where its registered services are categorized.&lt;ref name=Categories&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gamma|first1=N.|last2=do Mar Rosa|first2=M.|last3=da Silva|first3=M.|title=IT Services Reference Catalog|journal=Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers|date=27–31 May 2013|volume=Integrated Network Management (IM 2013), 2013 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on|pages=764–767|isbn=978-1-4673-5229-1|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6573073|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large percentage of Categories for services are derived from the areas of an enterprise and the functions it performs, such as Information Technology, Operations, and Fulfillment.&lt;ref name=Categories/&gt;  Examples of common service categories include Marketing Services, Product Development Services, Fulfillment Services, and Support Services, which are consumed and performed by most businesses.

The purpose of categorization of services is to facilitate service curation, such as how books may be curated in a library.

== Resource management ==
The utilization of service catalogs allow enterprises to allocate and track resources, both human and systemic, which are required for successful service delivery, operations, and support.  This allows enterprises to understand where resources are allocated, whether there are too many or too few resources allocated, and whether or not the resources allocated are adequate for purpose.  It also allows an understanding of what resources are shared between multiple services versus those that are fully dedicated to a single service.

== Metrics driven transparency ==
Benefits of implementing and maintaining a service catalog include allowing an enterprise to track and manage metrics that represent the utilization of services and service-related traits, such as those associated with service supply and demand.  For example, enterprises can track and measure:

* Services that are most and least used (i.e. enterprise service demand)
* Services that are successfully delivering versus those that struggle to deliver (i.e. enterprise service supply)
* How many service requests are being invoked for each service (i.e. service-specific demand)
* How many service deliverables are making it to their targeted service requestors (i.e. service-specific supply)
* Who invokes what services most or least
* How much time it takes to approve service requests
* How much time it takes to deliver service outputs, once requests are approved
* Service finances, such as how much is spent on each service by those who invoke them and those who provide them

In addition to the above, a service catalog also helps leadership and management better see and understand correlations of service related work, assets, and resources to the people, organizations, and projects that request them.

== IT service catalog ==
An IT service catalog is a subset of an enterprise service catalog and is defined by the [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]] [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library#Service design|Service Design]] to be an exhaustive list of IT-only services that an organization provides or offers to its employees or customers. The catalog is the only part of the Service Portfolio that is published to customers and is used to support the sale and/or delivery of IT services.

== A user's perspective ==
A user goes to a website to search for a specific service, such as requesting a new laptop, requesting a change in
benefits, or adding a new employee to a department. The service catalog site groups services by category and allows for searching
(especially when hundreds or thousands of services are available). The user selects a desired service and sees the description and details. The user enters any pertinent information (contact information, service-specific questions) and submits the request for
service. The request requires approval, and goes through routing, service-level management, and other processes necessary to fulfill the request. The user may return to the site later to check on the status of a request, or to view overall metrics on how well the organization is performing the services it provides.

== A business unit manager's perspective ==
Business Unit Managers determine what services to "publish" to end-users via the service catalog.  Business Unit Managers and Analysts would determine what questions are to be asked of the user, any approvals necessary for a request, and what other systems or processes are needed to fulfill the request.  Once the service is defined and the fulfillment process organized, these people or a more technical employee would build the requisite functionality into the service definition and then publish this to the service catalog.

== Service catalogs for cloud computing services ==
The use of a service catalog for [[cloud computing]] services is an integral part of deploying services on private and public clouds. Users wishing to consume cloud services would use a cloud service catalog to view what cloud services are available, their function, and know the technologies used to provide the services.
&lt;ref name="JoeOnisick"&gt;Onisick, Joe. [http://www.networkcomputing.com/private-cloud-tech-center/232301316 Private cloud success factors include service catalog], Network Computing, January 05, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Users would also see the available different service level options based on latency and reliability. With this knowledge, users are able to change the configuration of the technologies used to deliver the services based on cost, performance and technology improvements.&lt;ref name="JoeOnisick" /&gt;

By seeing and understanding the different services available through the cloud users can better appreciate what is available to them, compared to traditional IT whereby one group of users or business unit may be unaware of the technologies available to another unit.&lt;ref name="JoeOnisick" /&gt;

Accessed by self-service portals, service catalogs contain a list of cloud services from which cloud consumers select for self-provisioning of cloud services.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Rich. [http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/03/29/cisco-buys-newscale-for-cloud-service-catalogs/ Cisco buys NewScale for cloud service catalogs], Datancenterknowledge.com, March 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This removes the need for users to work through various IT departments in order to provision a cloud service, nor are users required to provide detailed IT specifications. They are only required to provide business and organization requirements.

To make selection easier and to speed service deployment, service definitions are often standardized in cloud service catalogs. This presents three benefits: improved capacity planning, particularly if standard components are used; quicker service provisioning; and better buying forecasts which helps to lower costs.&lt;ref&gt;Flores, Rodrigo. [http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/06/04/the-competitive-threat-of-public-clouds/ The competitive threat of public clouds], Datacenterknowledge.com, June 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Automation is an aspect of cloud service catalog that has been noted. Cloud service catalogs have been described as enabling "cloud on auto-pilot" enabling cloud users to build cloud services based on pre-built templates selected from catalogs.

[[Image:Spring pouchong tea leaves on plate.jpg|thumb|''Spring Pouchong'' tea ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:包|包]][[wiktionary:種|種]][[wiktionary:茶|茶]]|p=Bāozhòngchá}}) leaves that may be used for tasseography divination]]

'''Tasseography''' (also known as '''tasseomancy''' or '''tassology''') is a [[divination]] or [[fortune-telling]] method that interprets [[pattern]]s in [[tea]] leaves, [[coffee grounds]], or [[wine sediments]].

The terms derive from the French word ''tasse'' ([[cup]]), which in turn derives from the  Arabic loan-word into French ''tassa'', and the [[Greek language|Greek]] suffixes [[wiktionary:-graph|-graph]] (writing), [[-logy]] (study of), and [[-mancy]] (divination).

Divination attempts to gain insight into the natural world through intuitive interpretation of [[Synchronicity|synchronistic]] events.

==History==
The first inklings of Western tasseography can be traced to medieval European fortune tellers who developed their readings from splatters of [[wax]], [[lead]], and other molten substances. This evolved into tea-leaf reading in the seventeenth century, a short time after Dutch merchants introduced tea to Europe via trade routes to [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;Guiley, Rosemary. "tasseomancy." The encyclopedia of witches, witchcraft, and wicca. 3rd ed. N.p.: Infobase Publishing, 2008. 341. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Wales]] and [[England]] have produced a number of practitioners and authors on the subject, and English [[pottery|potteries]] have crafted many elaborate tea cup sets specially designed and decorated to aid in  fortune-telling. Cultures of the Middle East that practice divination in this fashion usually use left-over coffee grounds from [[Turkish coffee]]/[[Lebanese coffee]]/[[Greek coffee]] turned over onto a plate.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Method of tea-leaf reading==
[[File:Tea leaf reading.jpg|thumb|An example of a tea leaf reading showing a dog and a bird on the side of the cup.]]
The ''Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology, Fifth Edition, Vol. 2'', edited by J. Gordon Melton, notes:

{{quote|After a cup of tea has been poured, without using a tea strainer, the tea is drunk or poured away. The cup should then be shaken well and any remaining liquid drained off in the saucer. The diviner now looks at the pattern of tea leaves in the cup and allows the imagination to play around [with] the shapes suggested by them. They might look like a letter, a heart shape, or a ring. These shapes are then interpreted intuitively or by means of a fairly standard system of [[symbol]]ism, such as: snake (enmity or falsehood), spade (good fortune through industry), mountain (journey of hindrance), or house (change, success).}}

Melton's described methods of pouring away the tea and shaking the cup are rarely seen; most readers ask the querent to drink the tea off, then swirl the cup.

It is traditional to read a cup from the present to the future by starting along the rim at the handle of the cup and following the symbols downward in a spiral manner, until the bottom is reached, which symbolizes the far future. Most readers see images only in the dark tea leaves against a white or neutral background; some will also read the reverse images formed by seeing the symbols that form in the white negative spaces, with a clump of dark leaves forming the background.

Certain western circles, consider it ill-advised for one to attempt tasseography using tea from a cut-open tea bag or to use a symbol dictionary. The reasons for these prohibitions are practical: tea-bag tea is cut too finely to form recognizable figures in the cup and tea-leaf reading has its own historic system of symbolism that does not correspond exactly with other systems, such as symbolic dream divination.

==Fortune telling tea cups==
[[File:Divination tea cup saucer.jpg|thumb|Zodiac cup and saucer with zodiac signs and shamrock]]
Although many people prefer a simple white cup for tea leaf reading, there are also traditions concerning the positional placement of the leaves in the cup, and some find it easier to work with marked cups. Beginning in the late 19th century and continuing to the present, English and American potteries have produced specially decorated cup and saucer sets for the use of tea-leaf readers. Many of these designs are patented and come with instructions explaining their mode of use. Some of the most common were those that were given away with purchases of bulk tea.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

There are dozens of individual designs of fortune tellers' cups, but the three most common types are zodiac cups, playing card cups, and symbol cups.

{| class="wikitable"
|+Three most common types of fortune tellers' cups
!Type
!Definition
|-
|Zodiac cups
|These sets contain [[zodiac]]al and planetary symbols. Typically the interior of the cup contains the planetary symbols, while the saucer has the astrological sign symbols, but there are many variations and exceptions to this common pattern. The placement of these symbols allows the reader to combine [[astrology]] with tasseography.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
|-
|Playing card cups
|These cups carry within their interiors tiny images of a deck of scattered cards, either 52 cards plus a joker, as in a [[poker]] deck, or 32 cards, as in a [[euchre]] deck. Some sets also have a few cards imprinted on the saucers, or the saucers may contain brief written card interpretations. The playing cards permit the reader to creatively relate [[cartomancy]] to tasseography.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
|-
|Symbol cups
|These sets are decorated with between a dozen and fifty of the most common visual cues that can be found in tea leaves, often numbered for easy reference and supplied with an explanatory booklet. The symbols are generally displayed inside the cups, but there are also sets in which they decorate the outside or appear in the cups and on the saucers.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
|}

==Coffee reading==
[[File:Coffereading.jpg|thumb|230px| ''Coffee reading'']]
Coffee tasseography is called καφεμαντεία in Greek, гледање у шољу in Serbian, and kahve falı in Turkish.
Traditionally, coffee readers use [[Turkish coffee]] or any method of coffee brewing that leaves grounds sitting at the bottom of the cup.  Most of the coffee in the cup is consumed, but the sediments are left to settle. It is often believed that the querent should not read their own cup.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

There are several variations of coffee reading.  They commonly require for the cup to be covered with the saucer and turned upside-down. In the Turkish tradition, coffee-readers often interpret the cup as being divided into horizontal halves: symbols appearing on the bottom half are interpreted as messages regarding the past, and symbols on the top half are messages regarding the future. The cup may also be interpreted in vertical halves to determine "yes" or "no" answers as well as the overall outcome of the events represented by symbols. For example, some fortune tellers may "read" symbols in the "left" half as "negative" events or outcomes, while symbols in the "right" half are "read" as "positive". Other readers may adhere to the belief that the cup is capable of revealing insights about the past, but it cannot predict events beyond forty days into the future. The saucer may also be incorporated into the reading. As with the cup, different variations exist for what the saucer represents, including whether the saucer sticking to the cup indicates a "positive" or "negative" outcome.&lt;ref&gt;"Your Future in a Cup of Coffee". Turkish Cultural Foundation. 2011. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Romanian methods require that the sediments be swirled around until they cover the majority of the cup's inside surface.  Other traditions, such as Turkish and Middle Eastern, do not require this swirling but do require that the cup be turned towards the querent in revealing the fortune. The coffee grounds are given time to dry against the cup before a reading begins.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

After a reading, the querent will be asked to "open the heart".  This is done by placing the right thumb at the inside bottom of the cup and twisting clockwise slightly.  This will leave an impression behind that the fortune teller will interpret as the querent's inner thoughts or emotions.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 2007, a coffee-reading fortune teller from [[Israel]] was charged with practicing magic, a crime punishable by up to five years in jail.  The fortune teller in question was acquitted of the charges after the Israeli government deemed it too hard to prove she was knowingly "faking it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/article24466912.html McClatchy DC: Coffee grounds brewed trouble for Israeli fortuneteller]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
Many interpretations for symbols exist, but readers commonly focus on the color of the symbols.  Since most cups used are white or ivory and the grounds are dark, symbols are formed from the strong, contrasting colors. White is considered a "good" symbol foretelling of generally positive things for the querent, while the grounds themselves are considered to form "bad" symbols.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Symbols can be many things, including people, animals, and inanimate objects.  Usually, the fortune teller will group nearby symbols together for a prediction.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''''The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love''''' is a [[self-help]] book, written by [[Christian]] writers [[Tim LaHaye|Tim]] and [[Beverly LaHaye]].

==Introduction==
''The Act of Marriage'' is concerned with helping [[marriage|couples]], particularly the female partner, to achieve [[orgasm|sexual satisfaction]]. The book was first printed in 1976 and boasts a readership of over 2.5 million readers.&lt;ref&gt;LaHaye, Tim, and Beverly LaHaye. ''The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love.'' [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]: [[Zondervan]], 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; While the book is written to be understood by anyone, the primary audience is meant to be Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zondervan.com/Cultures/en-US/Product/ProductDetail.htm?ProdID=com.zondervan.9780310211778&amp;QueryStringSite=Zondervan Description from the publisher]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the book is noteworthy for opening up dialogue among Christians about their sexuality&lt;ref name="PW"&gt;[http://www.zondervan.com/Cultures/en-US/Product/ProductDetail.htm?ProdID=com.zondervan.9780310211778&amp;QueryStringSite=Zondervan Review] by [[Publishers Weekly]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/us/Story?id=4651272&amp;page=2 "Christians Promote Holy, Hot Sex in Marriage" at abc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;—especially female sexuality and sexual satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Act-of-Marriage/Tim-LaHaye/e/9780310212003#TABS review] by [[Library Journal]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heller, J. 2002.

Since its initial publishing in 1976, ''The Act of Marriage'' has been published again in 1998 as ''The Act of Marriage, Revised &amp; Updated'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product/939756774?item_no=21177&amp;event=CF&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2000 as ''The Act of Marriage after 40: Making Love for Life''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?item_no=31141&amp;event=CF&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolling Stone]] magazine criticized the book as "an explicit Christian sex manual, condemning [[making out|petting]], [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/5939999/reverend_doomsday/ "Reverend Doomsday"] in the [[Rolling Stone]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Christian groups hail the book as a milestone in contemporary Christian  [[sex education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/mwt/excerpt/2008/04/09/rapture_ready/ Salon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meridianmagazine.com/familyconnections/050217honeymoon.html Meridian Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828163318/http://meridianmagazine.com/familyconnections/050217honeymoon.html |date=2008-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familyfed.org/bfd/book-list_hw_relations.htm familyfed.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020124713/http://www.familyfed.org/bfd/book-list_hw_relations.htm |date=2008-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marriagemoments.org/index.php?s=content&amp;p=resources Marriagemoments.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been endorsed by "Pastors, doctors, and psychologists alike".&lt;ref&gt;[http://shopping.msn.com/specs/the-act-of-marriage-the-beauty-of-sexual-love/itemid2531025/?itemtext=itemname:the-act-of-marriage-the-beauty-of-sexual-love&amp;fulldesc=1 MSN Shopping]&lt;/ref&gt; This claim of professional endorsement, however, is made by the publisher without any accompanying data which would allow for verification and there have been no statements of this nature made by the American Medical Association or the American Psychological Association.

== Chapter summaries ==

=== Chapter 1: The Sanctity of Sex ===
This chapter sets out to convince the reader that [[Religion and sexuality#Christianity|sex is holy and sacred]], not dirty—an attitude they have found to be prevalent among the couples they have [[relationship counseling|counseled]]. They cite several examples in both the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] where intimate behavior between married persons is commended.

=== Chapter 2: What Lovemaking Means to a Man ===
In this chapter the authors set out five benefits that men derive from [[intimacy]] with their [[wife|wives]]:
# It satisfies his [[Libido|sex drive]], which is usually greater than his wife's.
# It boosts his [[self image]].
# It increases the love he feels for his wife and makes it less likely that he will engage in [[extramarital affair]]s.
# It [[Human sexual response cycle#Resolution phase|calms him down]] and makes him less prone to find fault with his family.
# It provides one of the most [[orgasm|exciting experiences]] of his life.
Overall, the chapter is concerned with convincing wives that it is okay for their husbands to want to have sex with them.

=== Chapter 3: What Lovemaking Means to a Woman ===
In this chapter the authors set out five benefits that women derive from intimacy with their husbands.

# It reassures her of her husband's love. They point out that a woman needs to feel [[interpersonal relationship|companionship love]], [[compassion|compassionate love]], [[romantic love]], and [[affection|affectionate love]] from her husband before she will feel ready to accept [[passion (emotion)|passionate love]].
# It satisfies her sex drive.
# It helps her to relax and to not be high-strung.
# It is the ultimate experience when properly done.
Overall, the chapter is concerned with convincing husbands that women can and need to be sexually satisfied, too.

=== Chapter 4: Why God Created Sex ===
In this chapter the authors present five reasons that [[God]] created sex, in spite of how it is misused by many.
# It is needed to [[sexual reproduction|propagate]] the human race.
# It provides a married couple the means to give mutual pleasure.
# It allows spouses to be fulfilled with each other and to be less tempted by [[extramarital sex|other sexual opportunities]].
# The husband will have claim over his wife and the wife will have claim over her husband.
# It creates a unique union and method of communication between two people that cannot be shared with anyone else.
Overall, the chapter is concerned with convincing couples that sex is a blessing from God, but that it should only be experienced within the bonds of marriage.

=== Chapter 5: Sex Education ===
This chapter explains the [[male reproductive system (human)|male]] and [[female reproductive system (human)|female sex organs]] and how they respond to [[sexual stimulation]]. Some counsel is given on how to avoid or reduce pain when [[virginity|breaking]] the [[hymen]]. Emphasis is placed on the [[clitoris]] as the seat of the female [[orgasm]]. The differences between male and female orgasms are also outlined.

=== Chapter 6: The Art of Lovemaking ===
This chapter outlines the basic steps taken during a lovemaking session. It includes preparations that should be taken, [[foreplay]], [[sexual intercourse|the act itself]], and the "afterglow" that follows completion of the act. They stress the importance of the husband waiting until his wife is fully aroused before entering her vagina and proceeding to orgasm. They recommend that a couple use their [[honeymoon]] for experimentation so that they can best learn how to please their partner. The importance of clitoral stimulation to achieve female orgasm is again stressed. Male and female sexual responses are again compared and a brief discussion of positions is given.

=== Chapter 7: For Men Only ===
This chapter gives eleven suggestions on how men can satisfy their wives.
# Educate yourself on the female anatomy.
# Learn to control your [[ejaculation]] so it does not [[premature ejaculation|happen prematurely]].
# Concentrate on the woman's satisfaction, not your own.
# Remember what arouses a woman (companionship, compassionate, romantic, and affectionate love).
# Control your [[anger|temper]].
# Avoid the use of [[profanity|crude words]].
# Avoid [[gossip|speaking of private matters with friends and colleagues]].
# Avoid [[body odor|smelling bad]].
# Avoid rushing the act.
# Have open communication with your wife.
# Love your wife as a person.

=== Chapter 8: For Women Only ===
This chapter gives nine suggestions on how women can satisfy their husbands and achieve satisfaction themselves during the sex act.
# Keep a [[optimism|positive mental attitude]]. This is broken down into three parts: have a positive attitude about sex, a positive attitude about yourself, and a positive attitude about your husband.
# Recognize that many [[sexual inhibition|inhibitions]] need to be abandoned in the bedroom.
# Remember that your husband is stimulated by sight.
# Avoid nagging, criticizing, or ridiculing your husband.
# Remember that while you may not be in the mood for sexual relations when your husband makes advances, you are capable of responding and "getting into the mood."
# [[feminine hygiene|Keep your feminine parts clean]].
# Communicate with your husband and tell him what pleases you.
# [[prayer|Pray]] and ask God for help in achieving sexual satisfaction.

=== Chapter 9: The Unfulfilled Woman ===
This chapter declares that many wives are not as satisfied by sexual encounters as they could be because they fail to achieve orgasm. Eleven reasons are given why women might experience dissatisfaction with sex and suggestions are given on how to overcome those problems.
# Ignorance on both her part and her husband's part on how to achieve [[clitoral orgasm]].
# Feelings of hate or hostility towards someone else, especially her husband.
# Feelings of guilt, especially those brought on by [[premarital sex]] premarital or extramarital indiscretions.
# Fear that she will not be able to be satisfied or satisfy her husband.
# Being too passive during the act.
# A husband who ejaculates before she has climaxed
# [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]].
# Illness.
# Being [[overweight]].
# Being unwilling to surrender herself to her husband.
# Having weak [[vagina]]l muscles.

=== Chapter 10: The Key to the Feminine Response ===
This chapter explains how [[Arnold Kegel|Dr. Arnold H. Kegel]] started training women to [[Kegel exercise|exercise]] their [[pubococcygeus]] muscle in order to curb postpartum [[urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. It was discovered that a side effect of this exercise was to improve women's ability to experience orgasm. The authors recommend an exercise regimen for women seeking to improve their sexual response.

=== Chapter 11: The Impotent Man ===
This chapter gives nineteen reasons why husbands may experience [[impotence|inability to maintain an erection]] or ejaculate and gives suggestions on how to overcome those problems.
# The onset of age: they will lose vital energy as they get older.
# Feelings of hate or hostility towards someone else, especially his wife.
# Fear (of rejection, of being unable to satisfy his wife, of being compared with other men, of failure to maintain erection or to ejaculate).
# Ridicule from his wife.
# Feelings of guilt, especially those brought on by premarital or extramarital indiscretions.
# Having unreasonable expectations about how he will be able to perform as his age increases.

# A dominating wife.
# Premature ejaculation.
# Retarded ejaculation.

=== Chapter 12: Sane Family Planning ===
The authors express their belief that a husband and wife should produce as many children as they can reasonably manage and deplore several reasons some give for avoiding parenthood. They counter with several reasons why parents should seek to have and raise children. They then give suggestions for contraception that they believe are appropriate for Christians (because they are not [[abortifacient]]). They recommend, in order of reliability, [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]], [[condom]]s, [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]], [[spermicide|vaginal foam]], the [[calendar-based methods|rhythm method]], and [[coitus interruptus]]. They recommend against permanent methods, such as [[vasectomy]] and [[tubal ligation|having tubes tied]].

=== Chapter 13: Sex Survey Report ===
The authors report the results of a [[opinion poll|survey]] they conducted. Their intent is to show that a) Christians have more fulfilling sex lives than their non-Christian counterparts and b) Christians don't have the [[Victorian morality|Victorian attitudes]] about sex that they are stereotyped as having.

=== Chapter 14: The Missing Dimension ===
In this chapter the authors advocate that the most important element to a satisfying sex life and a satisfying life overall is to have a personal relationship with [[Jesus Christ]]. They advocate a Christian lifestyle and suggest that a shared belief in Christ will help a couple overcome incompatibilities.

=== Chapter 15: Practical Answers to Common Questions ===
In this chapter, the authors field questions on a variety of topics, including [[abortion]], [[adultery]], [[birth control]], communication, counseling, [[dating]], fantasy, [[fornication]], [[free love]], [[homosexuality]], [[masturbation]], [[menopause]], [[oral sex]], [[making out|petting]], [[privacy]], "September sex", etc.

==Academic Study==

Within academia, the Act of Marriage is viewed as an interesting insight into the ever changing relationship between mainstream religion and sexual practice. Michigan State Professor, Amy DeRogatis, took a deep look at this book and others of the sort to explore the impacts they have on gender roles within Protestant Evangelical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/church-history/article/what-would-jesus-do-sexuality-and-salvation-in-protestant-evangelical-sex-manuals-1950s-to-the-present/A0D3B75DDB5D49ADB5E65D2725F72C20&lt;/ref&gt; While it pushes the boundaries of accepted sexual practice within Evangelical heterosexual marriage to that point, it upholds a strictly [[complementarian]] view of gender. At some points within the text it describes men as "beasts" and "uncontrollable" in the context of sexual desire, while it paints women as pleasers and far less sexual than their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;LaHaye, Tim, and Beverly LaHaye. The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this seems overly traditionalist, they were not out of line with commonly held cultural belief. Even secular author Alex Comfort's [[The Joy of Sex]] promotes the idea of natural gender roles and a far more sexually driven male.

'''The Authors Road''' is a non-commercial archive and [[documentary research]] project that explores the art of writing through interviews with American authors and experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vendituoli |first=Marion |url=http://www.nogalesinternational.com/the_bulletin/news/authorsroad-project-stops-in-patagonia/article_4b84dd60-83ea-11e1-87c9-0019bb2963f4.html |title=‘AuthorsRoad’ project stops in Patagonia - The Bulletin: News |publisher=Nogalesinternational.com |date=2012-04-11 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rvlife.com/columns/first-glance/4137-firstglance-calling-on-authors.html |title=First Glance: Calling on Authors - RV Life Magazine |publisher=Rvlife.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean BartlettPacifica Tribune Correspondent |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19435216?IADID=Search-www.mercurynews.com-www.mercurynews.com |title=The great 'American' literary quest by Authors Road team George Mason and Salli Slaughter - San Jose Mercury News |publisher=Mercurynews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their goal is to provide a repository or library of multi-media information about American writers in a way that honors writers and their craft, shares insights into the art of writing, and introduces the people behind the stories that are the basis to books, movies, plays, newspapers, magazines and poetry journals. This ongoing archive can be used by schools, universities, writers, researchers, and of course readers who wish to learn more about their favorite writer. In addition, writers, writers organizations, and museums representing writers use the materials to help promote better understanding and insight on writing.

== Background ==
Begun in 2011 under the auspices of [[Willamette Writers]], its principals, George Mason and Salli Slaughter have thus far traveled through 20 states meeting and interviewing major published American writers and experts on dead writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=contribute now |url=http://www.opb.org/radio/programs/thinkoutloud/segment/the-authors-road-chronicling-americas-writers/ |title=The Authors Road: Chronicling America's Writers » Radio |publisher=OPB |date=2013-10-28 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video and audio interviews are shared on a non-commercial website, [http://www.authorsroad.com AuthorsRoad.com] that also includes information about the writer, as well as travel stories and photos.

George and Salli drive a truck they named, Rocinante Tres, after the horse of Don Quixote and John Steinbeck’s camper-truck used while writing Travels with Charley. Rocinante Tres hauls a fifth-wheel trailer they named, Hardscribble Hacienda after writer Hugh Mulligan’s home, Hardscribble House.&lt;ref name="portland2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=George and Salli's excellent adventure |url=http://portlandtribune.com/bnw/21-news/202348-george-and-sallis-excellent-adventure |work=Boom! |publisher=Portland Tribune |date=December 1, 2013 |accessdate=July 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trip began travelling from [[Oregon]], to [[California]] and [[Arizona]] (with an extended stay in [[Patagonia, Arizona|Patagonia]]).&lt;ref name="santa cruz"&gt;{{cite news|author=Marion Vendituoli |title=‘AuthorsRoad’ project stops in Patagonia |url=http://www.nogalesinternational.com/the_bulletin/news/authorsroad-project-stops-in-patagonia/article_4b84dd60-83ea-11e1-87c9-0019bb2963f4.html |work=The Weekly Bulletin |place=[[Santa Cruz County, Arizona|Santa Cruz County]] |date=April 11, 2012 |accessdate=July 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 2014 the Authors Road had driven more than 40,000 miles through 20 states, interviewed 45 people, given more than a dozen free presentations in libraries, schools, bookstores and civic groups, and appeared in dozens of media interviews and articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean BartlettCorrespondent |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/pacifica/ci_25982257/sharp-park-library-event-traveling-tales-two-writers |title=Sharp Park library event - The traveling tales of two writers meeting writers - San Jose Mercury News |publisher=Mercurynews.com |date=2014-06-17 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vaucluse House''' is an [[heritage register|heritage-listed]] former Aboriginal land, residence, colonial farm and country estate and now tourist attraction, house [[museum]] and public park located at 69a Wentworth Road, [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]] in the [[Municipality of Woollahra]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. Completed between 1803 and 1839 in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, its design was attributed to [[William Wentworth|William Charles Wentworth]] and built by [[Henry Browne Hayes|Sir Henry Browne Hayes]] and W. C. Wentworth. The property is owned by the [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The site was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045008|Vaucluse House|hr=00955|fn=H00/00363; S96/00465 [S170]|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaucluse House is a 19th-century estate with house, kitchen wing, stables and outbuildings, surrounded by {{convert|28|acre|ha|order=flip}} of formal gardens and grounds located on the south-eastern shores of [[Port Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/vaucluse-house|title=Vaucluse House|date=29 October 2013|work=Sydney Living Museums|access-date=3 November 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319184645/https://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/vaucluse-house|archive-date=19 March 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house is one of the few 19th-century houses near [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] retaining a significant part of its original setting.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

The property was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 with the following statement of significance:&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
{{block quote|''Today Vaucluse House is one of the few 19th century houses on Sydney Harbour retaining a significant part of its original estate setting. One distinguishing surviving characteristic of the 19th century estate is its careful division into specific areas, both functional and ornamental, such as pleasure garden, kitchen garden, rear service yard, paddocks, carriageway, creek, estate backdrop, beach paddock.

''Vaucluse House is significant because of its association with the Wentworth family and their aspirations. It has a large collection of surviving original documentary evidence relating to the house, its contents and occupants. There are a number of extant buildings and gardens and the house retains relative intactness of form, interior space and detailing predating 1900.

''A large early Victorian garden and shrubbery, laid out to compliment a gothic revival house belonging to the family of the important colonial pioneer and politician W.C. Wentworth. There appears little early documentation of the garden but it can be presumed to have been designed to complement the mid-19th Century additions to the house and to have been established by the 1860's.''|Statement of significance, [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]].}}

== History ==
The ''Vaucluse Estate'' comprises the [[land grant]]ed to Thomas Laycock in 1793, being {{convert|80|acre|ha|order=flip}}; {{convert|25|acre|ha|order=flip}} granted to Robert Cardell in 1795; {{convert|40|acre|ha|order=flip}} granted to Francis MacGlynn; and {{convert|370|acre|ha|order=flip}} granted to [[William Wentworth]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; In 1803 the Irish convict Sir Henry Browne Hayes purchased Laycock's grant and a grant adjacent to it. Hayes erected a cottage and other buildings. He named the property Vaucluse, probably after the Italian poet Petrarch's estate [[Fontaine-de-Vaucluse]] in [[Avignon]], France. Vaucluse was leased until 1814. It was left vacant after this except for a year's rental to [[John Piper (military officer)|Captain John Piper]] in 1814.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

The original Vaucluse House was built by [[Henry Browne Hayes|Sir Henry Brown Hayes]], who had been transported to [[New South Wales]] in 1802 for kidnapping the daughter of a wealthy Irish banker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/stories/keeping-appearances |title=Keeping Up Appearances|access-date=19 March 2015|website=Sydney Living Museums |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319193112/http://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/stories/keeping-appearances |archive-date=19 March 2015 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Gidley King|Governor King]] considered Hayes "a restless, troublesome character" and was keen to move him {{convert|3|km}} away from Sydney. So in 1803 Hayes was granted permission to purchase the land and house, which was originally granted to Thomas Laycock in 1793 and Robert Cardell in 1795. An avid admirer of the 14th-century poet [[Petrarch]], Hayes named the house after Petrarch's [[Fontaine de Vaucluse (spring)|Fontaine de Vaucluse]], the famous spring near the town [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue|l'Isle sur la Sorgue]] in what is today the Department of [[Vaucluse]] in the South of [[France]]. He built a small but charming cottage and several outbuildings. {{convert|50|acre|ha|order=flip}} were cleared for agriculture and several thousand fruit trees were planted, none of which survive. Newspaper accounts describe it as a small but very charming farm. There is some warrant for the story that Hayes surrounded his property with turf from Ireland to keep out the snakes. In 1812 Hayes was pardoned by [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]] and sailed to [[Ireland]] where he lived another 20 years. Ownership of the property became uncertain until it was acquired in 1822 by Captain [[John Piper (military officer)|John Piper]].

"It was then a mere waste of land until Sir Henry Hayes built a dwelling house upon it and cultivated a garden".  This is now one observer described the Vaucluse improvements soon after Sir Henry Browne Hayes acquired {{convert|105|acre|ha|order=flip}} in this isolated spot of Port Jackson.  Naming the property after the village of Vaucluse in the south of France, he built a small cottage and in 1803 set about transforming his "mere waste of land", building two huts and outbuildings, clearing {{convert|50|acre|ha|order=flip}} for agricultural uses and planting several thousand fruit trees.  None of these survive.  Hayes left the colony in 1812, his estate was bought by Captain John Piper in 1822, the newspapers describing it as "a small farm".&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; Between 1813 and 1827 the estate passed through several hands.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

===Willian Charles Wentworth===
[[File:Vaucluse House 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Vaucluse House exterior]]
{{main|William Wentworth}}
On 27 August 1827 William Charles Wentworth who, together with [[Gregory Blaxland]] and Lt.[[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]], was an explorer of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], and a barrister, author and co-editor, and publisher of ''[[The Australian]]'' newspaper, purchased the {{convert|40|acre|ha|order=flip|adj=on}} estate from Captain John Piper. He consolidated the estate through an additional {{convert|370|acre|ha|order=flip|adj=on}} grant brought the harbourside estate to {{convert|515|acre|ha|order=flip}}. Wentworth used Vaucluse as a family home and as a setting to enhance his status as a public figure.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1319&gt;Smith, 2014, 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

W. C. Wentworth was born on board the ''Surprise'' moored off [[Norfolk Island]] in 1790, to surgeon [[D'Arcy Wentworth]] and former Irish convict mother, Catherine Crowley. He spent his early years on the island, returning to [[Sydney]] with his parents to settle in [[Parramatta]], where D'Arcy became a prosperous land owner. In 1802 William Charles was sent to England to be educated. On his return in 1810 [[Lachlan Macquarie|Governor Macquarie]] appointed him as acting [[Provost marshal|provost-general]], granting him {{convert|1750|acre|ha|order=flip}} along the [[Nepean River]]. On 15 October 1810 Wentworth rode his father's horse to victory in the first official horse race on Australian soil, in [[Hyde Park, Sydney]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1319/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

In 1813 he, with Blaxland and Lawson, led an expedition that crossed the Blue Mountains, with four servants and an Aboriginal guide. As a reward W. C. Wentworth was granted another {{convert|1000|acre|ha|order=flip}}. He continued to assist his father with his business activities, combining farming interests with sandalwood trading in the South Pacific, before returning to England in 1816 to study law at [[Cambridge University]]. While there he wrote a book published in London in 1818 "A Statistical, Historical and Political Description of the [[Colony of New South Wales]]". He argued for political reform and liberalisation, advocating elected assembly for NSW, trial by jury and free settler emigration.&lt;ref name="nswshr-955-1319" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; Wentworth returned to NSW in 1824. In 1827 his father died and he inherited his property, making him one of the wealthiest men in the colony. Purchasing land in eastern Sydney, he built Vaucluse House.&lt;ref name="nswshr-955-1319" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; From the time of his grant of {{convert|370|acre|ha|order=flip}} Wentworth began sub-dividing the land.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1322&gt;Mather, 1982, 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

Wentworth's total estate was {{convert|515|acre|ha|order=flip}}; his estate stretching from the [[Macquarie Lighthouse]] on South Head to the eastern heights of [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]].  Wentworth and his wife Sarah Cox moved to the estate with their growing family in 1828, carrying out major building and ground works through 25 years of occupancy.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; By the 1830s the Wentworth family had made many visible improvements at Vaucluse, including turrets on the house, a sandstone stable in 1829 by architect George Cookney, a large kitchen wing and convict barracks.&lt;ref name="nswshr-955-1319" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

[[Conrad Martens]]' 1840 sketch from Vaucluse Bay shows a clear view to the residence and what appears to be a well-established climber (possibly ''[[Wisteria sinensis]]'') over the verandah. Wentworth did further work on the main house in the late 1840s including adding the verandah crenulations. At this time the vine seen in Martens' 1840 sketch was possibly removed to carry out this work. There is no fountain apparent. To the west is a dense grove of trees (possibly native) and a large Norfolk Island pine (''[[Araucaria heterophylla]]'') 25–30 years old and probably planted in the pre-1827 period.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1322/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

Colonial Secretary, [[Alexander Macleay]] received the Yulan magnolia (M.denudata), a small tree from south-eastern China, at [[Elizabeth Bay, New South Wales|Elizabeth Bay]], in 1836. From the 1850s onwards it is listed for sale in nurseries such as the Darling Nursery, Sydney and Guilfoyle's Exotic Nursery in [[Double Bay, New South Wales|Double Bay]]. This tree is currently in bloom in the Vaucluse House pleasure garden.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1324&gt;Holliday, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; Vaucluse House and its furnishings were clearly intended to provide the correct social surroundings for Wentworth and his wife's immediate family of seven daughters and three sons. Sir Henry Browne Hayes' modest structure disappeared within the building fabric of the Wentworth's gothic mansion. The public areas were designed for effect and the Drawing and Dining Rooms, long hall and sweeping staircase was as fashionable as the Wentworth's taste would allow.  Vaucluse House was never completed due to factors which included the 1840s depression and Wentworth's intentions for a full facade, bedroom additions and formal entrance are unknown.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

Although Wentworth was a prominent and important figure in colonial politics, he was never welcomed into the Sydney "exclusives" club. Initially Wentworth identified himself with the cause of the emancipists and native-born Australians, establishing the first non-government newspaper, ''The Australian'', to agitate for reform. He entered the [[Parliament of New South Wales]] in 1843, a rather dynamic time in Australian politics. Wentworth chaired a committee formed to draft a new constitution for NSW. The democrats and radicals accused him of attempting to create a "bunyip aristocracy" that gave voting rights to the wealthy land owners and squatter class in the colony. After a number of re-drafts a democratic constitution was accepted and responsible government formed, although the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|NSW Legislative Council]] remained unelected. Wentworth also had a proposed plan to purchase the entire south island of [[New Zealand]] from the Maori tribes.&lt;ref name="nswshr-955-1319" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

Wentworth regarded Vaucluse House as an estate—a private residence with outbuildings. Several outbuildings remain and their function can be easily identified. It acted as a base for a man who helped form the [[Australian Patriotic Association]], who had one of his constitutional drafts serve as the basis for a colonial government granted by London, was a member of the Legislative Council, who was an active player in the improvement of education and was involved in the establishment of [[The University of Sydney]] and was Chair for the Select Committee that drafted the 1854 constitutional document.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

====John Hosking lease====
In March 1853 the family sold most of the contents of the house by auction and moved to Europe. In December the house and {{convert|163|acre|ha|order=flip}} within the fences was leased to John Hosking for three years. When they left for England in 1854, the estate was well established.  The 1854–56 lease agreement to John Hosking required him to keep "the park, gardens, orangeries, vineyard and buildings, fencing, hedges, ditches, gates, bridges, stiles, rails, poles, posts and drains in good and sufficient order".  No mention is made of the fountain. There is also reference to gravel being rolled; from this it can be assumed that either the garden paths and /or the drive were gravelled. Bridges referred to would be of two types—vehicular for crossing the creek and pedestrian.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1326&gt;Mather, 1982, 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; From the available literature, pictorial information, sub-division plans and municipal maps of the Wentworth Estate it can be established that the garden and grounds were most characteristically the curtilage of an estate residence completed in the 1860s and reaching maturity in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1327&gt;Mather, 1982, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

====Subsequent occupation by the Wentworth family====
When the Wentworths returned briefly in 1861–62, many improvements were made to the pleasure grounds.  The gothic revival iron verandah was built and fountain installed in the pleasure garden.  The Wentworths returned with advanced European tastes. Renovations at Vaucluse were necessary after several years of relative neglect by tenants, and the present verandah with its Gothic Revival columns replaced an earlier flat roofed verandah. Use of the estate grounds extended to the harbour side Beach Paddock. The family introduced new plantings to the gardens and orchards and innovations in fencing shaped and formalised the approaches to the property. At this time the fountain on the front lawn was built.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1326/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

The Wentworths returned to England in 1862, the estate being occupied by various agents, relations and members of the immediate family.  Visitors have enjoyed the spectacular display of the climber Wisteria sinensis on the house's verandah every spring since 1862.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Parramatta Advertiser]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, a very dry year for Sydney, the fire brigade was called to a fire at Vaucluse House: at this time the estate was said to be in the care of Wentworth's servants. Fire just penetrated the garden but the brigade prevented it reaching the house or destroying the garden. The pictorial material available for this period, including the [[Woollahra, New South Wales|Woollahra]] Municipal Council plan by Higginbotham and Robinson (1889) which shows the fence pattern, outbuildings and entry road, gives a clear picture of the layout of the period. The sketch from the "Town and Country Journal" (1873) shows a well-established front shrubbery, fountain and a large Araucaria in the front lawn. The entry drive is shown with young plants at regular intervals—possibly an avenue or the beginnings of a hedge. To the east of the drive is a clump of giant bamboo. Rebecca Martens' views of 1869 placed close to the photographs of the same view clearly show the character of the estate. Her view of the front of the residence shows a curving drive, front shrubbery and two dominant Araucarias. The side view of the eastern area outside the kitchen, shows the Norfolk Island hibiscus (Lagunaria patersonia) tree nearly as tall as the two storey building. A small tree outside the kitchen is probably the existing [[Illawarra]] flame tree (Brachychiton acerifolium). Banana plants are also seen outside the kitchen and the carriage loop is less manicured than its present appearance. The iron estate fencing, seen later in this area and shown on the 1889 Higginbotham and Robinson plan, does not appear in the sketch. It appears that the drive and pasture areas were fenced earlier and the fencing around the house came later.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mather, 1982, 5–6, plant names added by Stuart Read&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1870s the house was occupied by family, friends or caretakers.  Wentworth died in England in 1872 and a public funeral was held in Sydney in 1873. Sarah and one of her daughters took up residence at Vaucluse during the slow completion of the Mausoleum in Chapel Road, returning to England in 1875 to visit family. Sarah only returned to Australia briefly.  Even after William's death in 1872, Sarah and  unmarried daughter Eliza continued an active lifelong interest in the property, even from abroad.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1328&gt;Bravery, 1997, 5–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

===Resumption by the NSW Government===
In 1900 the contents of the house were auctioned, and the house remained unoccupied until 1911.  Then some {{convert|28|acre|ha|order=flip}} including house and garden, were resumed by the [[Government of New South Wales]] for use as a public reserve. In 1910 the preservation of Vaucluse House was assured by Government resumption of the present estate of approximately {{convert|10|acre|ha|order=flip}}. The Department of Lands was apparently charged with establishing a public recreation ground at Vaucluse. The house and estate were first managed by an Honorary Board of Trustees as part of the [[Nielsen Park]]-Vaucluse Trust. Providing for the current needs took precedence over preservation and the ruins of the convict barracks, workers cottages, fences and stock shed were demolished. The Trust replaced the original gates in 1910–20 with four sets of gates. The square pillars and iron gates of the original Vaucluse Estate entrance were removed from Vaucluse Road near Nielsen Park and resited near the original driveway at the intersection of Wentworth Road and Olola Avenue. The house, although virtually empty, was open on weekends and holidays. In 1917 two towers were added to the eastern facade and the crenulations continued across the front facade to give a semblance of completeness. The character of the garden changed in detail more than layout'. In the 1920s further changes took place including the formalisation of the carriage circle with the removal of the Bunya Bunya Pine and construction of a grassed loop. By the mid 1920s almost all evidence of the Wentworth entry road had been lost and was replaced by Wentworth Road. Olola Avenue was built. Until this decade substantial areas of cleared land survived in the east and west.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

In the 1920s the house was opened to the public and great changes began in its grounds. The kiosk (now tearooms) was built, new pedestrian bridges built over the creek, and the ground level around the western side of the stables was radically altered for footpaths. Original gravel paths were bituminised, last remnants of the orchard and vineyard removed and the original entry drive disappeared.  Wentworth's precious bushland to the west and east was subdivided. In the 1930s Depression there was much relief work activity in the park. Concrete paths were laid, stone walls contained the creek.  Much work was done on the carriage loop including building stone walls, kerbing and arbours. An extensive rose garden was established in the central lawn. A rockery was formed around the bakery and the garden embellished with beds of azaleas, cannas, cinerarias and begonias—changing the 19th century estate into a 20th century municipal park.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

A Friends of Vaucluse House group formed well before the formation of the Historic Houses Trust of NSW.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-483&gt;Watts, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Further additions and alterations were made in the period up until 1966. In 1968 responsibility for the house and grounds was transferred to the [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service]] when it was declared a historic site under the National Parks and Wildlife Act of 1967. Over 200 indigenous trees were replanted and refurbishment of the house interiors was announced in 1978. The Trustees maintained their position until 1980 when the property became the responsibility of the Historic Houses Trust of NSW.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1328/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

In 1981 the property was transferred to the NSW Historic Houses Trust, who commenced work on a long-term conservation plan for the grounds.  This was based on a study of the site's history, contemporary documentation such as paintings, sketches, family papers, photographs, and research on 19th century garden practises in Australia. Today, Vaucluse House is one of the few 19th century houses on [[Sydney Harbour]] retaining a significant part of its original setting.  One distinguishing surviving characteristic of the 19th century estate is its careful division into specific areas, both functional and ornamental, such as pleasure garden, kitchen garden, rear service yard, paddocks, carriageway, creek, estate backdrop, beach paddock.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

In July 1981 the [[New South Wales Government Architect|Government Architect's]] Branch of the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]] was commissioned by the Historic Houses Trust to carry out a study of the Vaucluse House grounds. The aim was to trace their development from their beginnings to the present. Historic research undertaken by the Trust's researcher, Joy Hughes also informed this work. They study divided the history into eight chronological periods, derived from phases of ownership, major events and periods when a substantial amount of information was available. The current (1982) archaeological investigations filled out some gaps in knowledge about the property's history.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1327/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

===Vaucluse House gardens===
Several 20th century mature palms from front garden (public reserve) near the "approach road" (drive) and sandstone piers were removed, sold for replanting, {{circa|1996}}&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1329&gt;Bogle, pers.comm., 4 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; to recover a partial view from the house to Vaucluse Bay—this included some casuarinas.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1330&gt;Taylor, pers.comm., 4 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

From 1999 under the direction of curatorial adviser Dr James Broadbent and head gardener Dave Gray prepared a conservation policy for a small plot of land adjacent to the house's kitchen wing. Since the early 20th century the site of the original kitchen garden at Vaucluse House had been used first as a rubbish tip and then as a car park. It was decided to reinstate a kitchen garden there using heritage seeds imported from the Henry Doubleday Research Association in the UK via quarantine (basing it on varieties of vegetable and fruit that were available in the era of the Wentworths' occupation of the estate—1827–1853.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

Property staff undertook research to find out whether vegetable seeds from the era were available in Australia and if there were any references to preferred varieties at Vaucluse House estate. In 1830 it was reported that "in this garden there grows the most delicious fruit in the colony".&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1331&gt;The Australian, 13 January 1830&lt;/ref&gt; A number of seed-saving organisations provided old varieties and in many cases also gave the date on which these were first introduced into Australia. The Diggers Club in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and Eden Seeds in NSW supplied as many as 33 varieties of vegetable seed listed in early catalogues.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

These were planted in the new kitchen garden in time for the first Kitchen Garden Festival which was held in March 2000. A variety of fruit trees were also planted including Moorpark apricots, Greengage plums, pomegranates (Punica granatum) and various types of apples. The garden today (2010) grows approximately 90 varieties of vegetables, some of which have survived in Australia for over a century. Many such as Musselburgh leeks, Cos lettuce and Sugarloaf cabbage are still found in local greengrocers today. Rarities include root crops salsify and scorzonera (vegetable oyster), both like thin parsnips. The rhubarb variety "Victoria" has green not red stems.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1332&gt;Gray, 2010, 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

Sir Henry Browne Hayes's Vaucluse Cottage still exists (vestibule, little tea room, east end of the dining room, stone walls within the drawing room, the {{circa|1828–30}} little drawing room located on its former terrace), altho' completely engulfed by Wentworth's additions of {{circa|1828–30}} and {{circa|1834–42}}.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; There is also a strong possibility that the Wentworth kitchen garden had been Hayes's.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;&lt;ref name="nswshr-955-1348"/&gt; Since the formation of the Friends of Vaucluse and subsequently, the Friends of the Historic Houses Trust, funds have been raised from events at the property to support its interpretation and presentation. These include new estate fencing ($8500), the annual Kitchen Garden Festival, "Up the Garden Path" talks, annual Carols by Candlelight and more.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-483/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; [[Sydney Living Museums]] celebrated 100 years of Vaucluse House as a museum with a free open day on Sunday, 11 October 2015, including demonstrations of traditional needlework techniques and a display of rare treasures from William Charles Wentworth's personal collection.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1333&gt;https://www.slm.is/100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

In winter 2016 the drawing room refurbishment got underway—what is considered to be one of the finest surviving colonial interiors in Australia - design and create new window furnishings, re-upholster the furniture including 5 Wentworth-provenanced chairs using authentic sources, traditional methods and trades.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1334&gt;Nicholas, 2016, 15&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 2017 the works are almost completed, including the drawing room and the orientation rooms. The orientation room is being redesigned to enhance visitors' understanding of the site's complex history. The results will be unveiled in April 2017. This is a display, orientation and rest area for visitors. The ground floor room, which may have been Wentworth's estate office, has been redesigned to share stories of the site, from its enduring Aboriginal connections, its ownership by Sir Henry Browne Hayes and occupation by the Wentworth family to its transfer into public ownership and creation of a museum, including the important role played by Sydney Living Museums. The multi-layered display is a mix of bespoke joinery, interpretive panels and audiovisual components.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1335&gt;Nichols, 2017, 6–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

==Features==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}

===Ground floor===
[[File:VAUCLUSE - SYDNEY.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Drawing Room]]
# KITCHEN The kitchen is at the centre of the large two-storey service wing, constructed in 1829. As in most colonial houses, the service wing was a separate building to distance the risk of fire from the main house. Here the cook and her staff prepared all meals for family, guests and servants. The dresser, food safe and cast iron cooking range are original.
# SCULLERY The scullery is where washing up was done. Dirty water was emptied into the slop drain.
# DAIRY AND LARDER The dairy (for milk, butter and cheese preparation) and larder (for food storage) reflect the operation of Vaucluse as a self-sufficient colonial estate.
# CELLARS The two-roomed cellars were used for the cool storage of food and wine. The inner room retains its arched brick bins for bottled wine while hooks for hanging salted and cured meats survive on the original lath and plaster ceilings.
# HOUSEKEEPER’S ROOM The housekeeper’s room was the centre of domestic operations. The housekeeper was responsible for linen and the supervision of female domestic servants.
# BUTLER’S PANTRY The pantry was an office strategically located for the head of the household staff to oversee activities in the house and arrivals at the property. Here lamps were cleaned, refuelled and wicks trimmed; and china, glass and silverware cleaned polished and stored.
# FAMILY HISTORY ROOM In 1900 this room was used as a library. Today it houses an exhibition of the Wentworth family’s history.
# BREAKFAST ROOM The breakfast room is in part of the house built from 1837 to 1840. Most large colonial houses had a second dining room for informal family use. The decorative paint scheme by the firm Lyon, Cottier &amp; Co dates from the 1880s while the carved oak furniture was purchased by Fitzwilliam Wentworth in England in c1872.
# DINING ROOM The dining room is hung with family portraits in keeping with early 19th-century practice. The oak furniture belonged to the Wentworth family. The fine Gothic Revival [[sideboard]] and cupboards date from c1845 while the dining table and chairs (with their embossed Spanish leather upholstery) may have been part of a consignment of furniture sent from Europe in 1859. The floor of mid-19th century Italian glazed tiles is unusual and possibly a concession to the Australian climate. The chimney piece is of marble from Marulan in southern New South Wales.
# LITTLE TEA ROOM The little tea room’s joinery suggests that it was one of Wentworth’s first additions to the house after 1828. It has been furnished to reflect its use as a small informal sitting room. Cool in summer, with French doors opening onto the eastern verandah, in winter the room’s small size ensured it was easily heated.
# DRAWING ROOM The drawing room was formed partly within the walls of Sir Henry Browne Hayes original stone cottage and completed in 1847. The floral wallpaper border, plaster cornice, Italian marble fire surround and cast iron grate are all original. The drawing room was intended as a setting for potential suitors to meet the Wentworth daughters, owing to Sarah Wentworth’s social isolation. By 1853 when the original contents were sold before the Wentworth family’s departure for Europe, the room contained furniture in Brazilian rosewood with crimson damask upholstery. Today the room contains a collection of copies of old master paintings acquired by the Wentworth family in Italy, including copies of Flora after Titian, a Penitent Magdalene after Guido Reni and a Madonna and Child after Murillo.

===First floor===
# SECOND ROOM The second room, as it was called in 1853, was a private family sitting room. The fireplace and grate are original. Furniture has been acquired based on an 1853 inventory of the house.
# PRINCIPAL BEDROOM In 1853 the principal bedroom contained a winged wardrobe, chest of drawers and marble washstand. The four-post bed has been hung with a reproduction of a glazed chintz c1860 known to have been used in another Gothic Revival house, Greenoaks at Darling Point. The bed has the typical arrangement of three mattresses filled with straw, horsehair and feathers (bottom to top).
# FITZWILLIAM’S ROOM IN THE HALL Vaucluse House was left incomplete in the mid-1840s and the large open upper hall was partitioned by cupboards to create a bedroom for Wentworth’s second son, Fitzwilliam.

===Second floor===
# CHILDREN’S ROOM The nursery was probably used for the four youngest Wentworth children aged between five and 12 years in 1853. The room is furnished as a typical children’s room of the mid-19th century with children’s furniture and toys. The metal beds are hung with gauze mosquito nets.
# MISS WENTWORTH’S ROOM Miss Wentworth’s room was named for the eldest unmarried Wentworth daughter. In 1853 it was shared by Sarah Eleanor and Eliza Sophia Wentworth.

== Description ==
===Grounds / Estate===
Major characteristics of the grounds were the distinct precincts, or zones, within which specific uses occurred, varying types of maintenance applied to separate zones, dominant plants found in the grounds, detailing characteristic of the period, and the rural character of the surroundings.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1327/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

Eight distinct zones occur in the original property:
# Main entry area - directly east of the residence: this is essentially a functional space for arrival and circulation;
# The core garden, or pleasure garden—leading out from the [[veranda]]h the formal lawn around the [[fountain]], kept with close-cut grass and cut edges. Gravel paths with brick edge drains contained the formal lawn and led into the shrubbery.&lt;ref name="nswshr-955-1327" /&gt; It is probably that the original shrubbery was smaller than its present size, being made up of relatively low plants, therefore allowing the residence to command a view to the harbour. In this period it was considered desirable that a residence be elevated and command a view. It would appear that the basic layout of the shrubbery has not changed much though much of its period detailing has been lost. Details in photographs show low-clipped shrub edging to beds, cut grass edges, gravel paths with brick drains where necessary, climbing plants trained over wire frame arches and bamboo hand rails on the bridges.
# Park/pasture land outside the core garden and immediate house surrounds consisting of scattered tree groups in rough grass. This zone has been lost to a certain extent through the diminishing size of the estate, change in maintenance practices, and incursion of the shrubbery areas into what would have been parkland. However, with the proximity of residential development and its impact on the curtilage of the residence, some of these developments provide useful screening to the house;
# vineyard and orchard. The positions of these have been generally identified from 1880s photographs and by a local resident, Mr. C.V. Nathan.
# the Orangery for which a location has not been identified. Correspondence found by Mrs Joy Hughes indicates this orangery may have been in what is now called the South Paddock.
# Gardens are mentioned in some of the literature pertaining to the property. These are likely to have been kitchen (vegetable) gardens. The only documentary evidence is an 1830 diagram and the cultivation lines noticeable in the 1931, 1951 and 1978 aerial photographs.
# the estate backdrop was native forest occurring on the ridges and steeply sloping valley sides. This vegetation has suffered through the increase in residential development in the valley. All that remains of the once abundant native vegetation is the narrow band of vegetation along Olola Avenue.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

During this (20th) century a number of typically characteristic and dominant plants have been removed from the grounds, the most important of these being:&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1337&gt;Mather, 1982, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
* two Araucaria pines (in the front park and along Olola Avenue);
* a fig tree in the front park;
* two Magnolias to the west of the residence;
* willows (Salix sp.) along the creek.

The garden contains remnant indigenous plantings, 19th century bush, the original principal path and drive layouts as well as its relationship with the harbour.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1338&gt;Bravery, 1997, 4 &amp; 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The remains of the 19th Century garden however, are confined almost totally to the eastern side of the stream dividing the reserve.  This garden may be considered in three parts: 1) the lawn before the house; 2) the shrubbery, and 3) the carriage loop before the stables.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

# The Central lawn - extending from the verandah to the shrubbery, embellished with a fine Victorian fountain, surrounded by a path. Views back to the house, over the rest of the garden and (partially obscured) to the harbour.  Ground basin of fountain unsympathetically remodelled; brick edged gravel paths re-edged with concrete and resurfaced with asphalt.  Bounded on west by an impressive mature planting of magnolias, araucarias and palms well underplanted with ferns, cliveas etc.,&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
# Shrubbery - at the further (northern or harbour) end of the lawn. An intimate area irregularly planned with intersecting paths, refinished as above, and oddly shaped beds.  To the east originally lay a paddock and the entrance drive which, with the subdivision of the estate ahs been destroyed and the levels altered.  The area now had mature planting but of no particular value to the historic landscape.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
# Stable area - The carriage loop before the stable remains, somewhat altered in size and shape.  Intrusion of modern petty planting in the form of beds and edgings could be removed easily to regain the former character.  Separated from the central lawn by a small shrubbery, edged with tecoma (containing the remains of the original iron estate fencing and containing a large Ficus and good planting of camellias, dietes etc.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
# The kitchen garden - west of the (1–3) recreated {{circa|2001}} on the site of the original kitchen garden.&lt;ref name="nswshr-955-1338" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

Plant material in the parkland "estate" outside the estate fencing includes major trees of camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia)(several), brush box (Lophostemon confertus)(this species lines the [[driveway]] in the grounds' north-east and lines Olola Avenue's edge), cheese tree (Glochidion ferdinandi), two clumps of ornamental bamboo (Arundinaria sp./cv.), near the Vaucluse Bay beach a clump of giant bamboo (Bambusa balcooa), Hill's figs (Ficus microphylla 'Hillii'), golden Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa 'Aurea'), stone pine (Pinus pinea), Monterey pine (Pinus radiata)(specimen is dead), paperbarks (Melaleuca quinquenervia)(several north of the creek), London plane (Platanus x acerifolia)(several), black bean (Castanospermum australe), lilly pilly (Syzygium sp.), silky oaks (Grevillea robusta), Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla), coastal banksia (B.integrifolia), black locust/false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia), Queensland/macadamia nut (Macadamia integrifolia), Japanese cedar/tsugi (Cryptomeria japonica), hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii), kaffir plums (Harpephyllum caffrum)(2), common oak (Quercus robur), pin oak (Q.palustris)(several), Indiana bean tree (Catalpa bignonioides) and blue Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica 'Glauca'). The creek is lined with a number of bananas (Musa ensete/sp.) north of the pleasure garden.  Rear (south) of the house are a few remnant red cedar trees (Toona ciliata)&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

The pleasure garden inside the estate fencing is richly planted with species from the 19th century, including a shrubbery area, a border of trees and shrubs lining the eastern side of a long lawn between the house and the beach (originally, now Olola Avenue). Lining this border are major trees including a Port Jackson fig (Ficus rubiginosa), African yellow wood (Afrocarpus falcatus), evergreen magnolia/bull [[Bay (architecture)|bay]] (M.grandiflora: S.USA)(2), Mediterranean cypress (Cupressus sempervirens), orchid tree (Bauhinia variegata cv.: S. America), native weeping lily pilly (Waterhousia floribunda), poison bush (Akocanthera oppositifolia: S. Africa), native sweet pittosporum (P.undulatum), sweet bay/bay laurel (Laurus nobilis: Mediterranean) and Cook's pine (Araucaria columnaris: New Caledonia: a specimen on the lawn).&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1340&gt;Stuart Read, pers.comm., 16 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

North of the house and flanking the western side of the shrubbery to the creek are a large number of tall mature palms and emergent trees, including Lord Howe Island palms (Kentia fosteriana), bangalow/piccabeen palms (Archontophoenix cunninghamiana), cabbage tree palms (Livistona australis), Californian desert/fan palms (Washingtonia robusta), native frangipani (Hymenosporum flavum), soft tree ferns (Cyathea sp.), Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pine (A.cunninghamii).&lt;ref name="nswshr-955-1340" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

The pleasure garden with its expansive lawns and shrubbery of exotic curiosities replaces one of the [[pinnacle]] movements of 19th century horticulture - the Gardenesque. Developed by influential Scottish-born landscape designer John Claudius (J.C.) Loudon, the popular style was a response, in part, to the flood of exotic plants available to Victorian era gardeners. Displayed as geographically and aesthetically distinct "specimens" to emphasise differences in foliage, flowers and form, the plants on show at Vaucluse House are examples of a period defined by prosperous ports, imperial politics, seafaring trade networks and exciting scientific discovery. This pleasure garden remains Sydney's most complete surviving example of the Gardenesque, over 150 years later.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1342&gt;Lindsay, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

Vaucluse House's pleasure garden contains plants from the Americas. Rio de Janeiro was the First Fleet's second port-of-call travelling from England to New South Wales. In August 1787, Captain Phillip stocked up on cotton, coffee, cocoa, prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) and other crops of economic and agricultural importance from the Portuguese settlement, all intended for future new penal colony in Sydney. Ornamental plants from South America were cultivated in the colony from the earliest years, as trading ships continued to ply the Rio-Cape Town-Port Jackson route. Examples include blue ginger (Dichorisandra thrysiflora), Brazilian plume flower (Justicia carnea), floss flower (Ageratum/ Eupatorium), flame creeper (Pyrostegia venusta), Mexican viper (Maurandya barclayana),
sandpaper vine /purple wreath (Petraea volubilis), violet church (Iochroma cyanea), tree fuchsia, (F.arborescens), dahlias, snail vine (Phaesolus caracola), marvel-of-Peru (Mirabilis jalapa), heliotrope/cherry pie (Heliotropum peruvianum).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lindsay, 2017, botanical names added by Stuart Read&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

The garden also contains plants from Africa. Cape Town, with its famous central garden established by the Dutch East India Company, was final port-of-call for most ships plying the Indian Ocean route from Britain to NSW. When the Second Fleet sopped at the Cape in April 1790, Elizabeth Macarthur (travelling with her husband John, later settlers at Elizabeth Farm) enthusiastically described the beauty of its flora. Plants from Africa became immensely popular in colonial NSW for their hardiness as well as their beauty. 'Cape bulbs'—a group of flowering plants including freesias, gladioli and ixias—were collected avidly. In 1841 William Charles Wentworth displayed Nerine undulate, a Cape bulb, at Sydney's Floral and Horticultural (Society's) show.&lt;ref name="nswshr-955-1342" /&gt; African plants in the garden include bleeding heart vine (Clerodendron thompsonae), Nile/African lily (Agapanthus praecox), bird-of-paradise flower (Strelitzia reginae), giant honey flower (Melianthus major), geraniums (Pelargonium spp. / cv.s), kaffir lilies (Clivia miniata), Belladonna lilies (x Amaryllis/Amarygia belladonna), Cape plumbago (P.capensis) and Cape honeysuckle (Tecomaria capensis).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

Plants from Asia, and especially China, have had some of the greatest impact on the character of Sydney gardens. At Vaucluse House a significant collection of 19th century Camellia cultivars is the most obvious Chinese inheritance. China's horticultural treasures were largely unfamiliar to Western gardeners until the Treaty of Nanjing of 1842 opened official trade channels. Despite difficulties of access, well-connected NSW gardeners were able to introduce Chinese plants early - either from England or directly from trading ports of Canton (Guangzhou), where foreign merchants were permitted from the mid-18th century, and the Portuguese outpost of Macao. Chinese plants in the garden include shell ginger (Alpinia zerumbet), plume poppy, ''[[Macleaya cordata]]'' (named after [[Alexander Macleay]], colonial secretary of New South Wales from the 1820s-30s, and gardener at Elizabeth Bay House),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Read, Stuart, pers.comm., 14 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Camellia japonica cv.s, azaleas (Rhododendron indicum cv's), Cherokee rose (Rosa laevigata), ''[[Wisteria sinensis]]'', (introduced into Sydney by Alexander Macleay at Elizabeth Bay)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; orange jessamine / sweet box (Murraya paniculata), confederate rose (Hibiscus mutabilis), butterfly bush (Buddleja davidii), fried egg plant (Gordonia axillaris) and "Safrano" rose, (R. 'Safrano').&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

Large shrubs in this shrubbery area include Cotoneaster sp. (China), Angel's trumpets (Brugmansia cv.s: S. &amp; C. America)), bamboos (Arundinaria spp., Asia), lily-flowered magnolia (M.liliflora "Nigra", China), Viburnum odoratissimum (China), Camellia japonica cv.s (several, all double: China), autumn camellias (C.sasanqua cv.: China), butterfly bush (Buddleja davidii cv.s: China) and sage-leaved butterfly bush (B.salvifolia: S. Africa), Fuchsia microphylla, lasiandra (Tibouchina sp.: Brazil), Philodendron sp. (S. America), Paris daisy (Euryops pectinatus: S. Africa), Adam's needle/Spanish bayonet (Yucca gloriosa: Mexico), Tecoma stans (S. America) and more.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Read, pers.comm., 16 August 2009; origins added 14 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

===House complex===
Vaucluse House is a large Gothic style residence built around a much smaller 1805 house* in stages until the 1860s.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1347&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hht.net.au/museums/vaucluse_house|title=Vaucluse House|publisher=Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124222518/http://www.hht.net.au/museums/vaucluse_house|archivedate=24 November 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has crenellated [[parapet]]s, [[turret]]s and iron verandah posts. The verandah returns on three sides of the bay windowed front which has French windows with louvered shutters. The rear wings enclose a small [[courtyard]], most windows being 12 pane type  and doors of six panels. The roofs are slate and galvanised iron.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; Sir Henry Browne Hayes's Vaucluse Cottage still exists (vestibule, little tea room, east end of the dining room, stone walls within the drawing room, the {{circa|1828–30}} little drawing room located on its former terrace), altho' completely engulfed by Wentworth's additions of {{circa|1828–30}} and {{circa|1834–42}}.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; There is also a strong possibility that the Wentworth kitchen garden had been Hayes's.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1348&gt;Scott Carlin, pers.comm., 22 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The interior contains much fine Georgian cedar joinery, [[marble]] [[chimney]] pieces and Pompeii tiles to the hall floor.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1349&gt;Sheedy 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The main complex comprises two connecting two storey and one three storey building which contain reception rooms, halls, guest bedrooms, family rooms and bedrooms, servants quarters and the service wing.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

===Outbuildings===
Adjacent to the scullery are the dairy and larder. To the south is a building identified in 1853 as a store. The cottage layout suggests it was used originally as a house. A guardhouse is attached to, and post dates, the north-western corner of the courtyard wall. The laundry is immediately west of the house and creek. On the western side of the walled courtyard are a reservoir and pump associated with the water supply to the 1861–62 first floor bathroom, dressing room and water closet attached to the rear of the bedroom wing.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The stable is a two-storey building with stalls, carriage and tack rooms and fruit storage areas.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The tearoom is a single storey timber and tile building  constructed this century with adjacent stone terrace.&lt;ref name="nswshr-955-1338" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

=== Condition ===

As at 17 March 2015 the physical condition was good; and the archaeological potential was low to medium.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; Sir Henry Browne Hayes's Vaucluse Cottage still exists (vestibule, little tea room, east end of the dining room, stone walls within the drawing room, the {{circa|1828–30}} little drawing room located on its former terrace), altho' completely engulfed by Wentworth's additions of {{circa|1828–30}} and {{circa|1834–42}}.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; There is also a strong possibility that the Wentworth kitchen garden had been Hayes's.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1348/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

The curtilage of Vaucluse House, as it exists today (1982), although still containing much of the original layout and essential qualities of an estate curtilage, has lost some important elements of the original. This has resulted from the erosion of the surrounding acreage, pressure from residential development (both visually and by the change of drainage patterns, etc.) and the methods of, and attitudes to grounds maintenance. The result is an enclosed suburban park rather than the curtilage of an estate residence.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1327/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The house has a relative intactness of form, interior space and detailing predating 1900 such as the double water closet, wallpaper remnants and chimney pieces make the buildings an unusual survival of mid to late 19th century architecture, particularly G.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

=== Modifications and dates ===
*1803{{spaced endash}}Cottage built by Browne.
*180{{spaced endash}} the Irish convict Sir Henry Browne Hayes purchased Laycock's grant and a grant adjacent to it. Hayes erected a small cottage, two huts and outbuildings, cleared 50 acres (20ha) for agricultural uses and planting several thousand fruit trees.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
*7 August 1827{{spaced endash}}William Wentworth purchased the estate. Wentworth added adjacent lands, gained by grant and purchases up to a total of 515 acres (208ha), his estate stretching from the Macquarie Lighthouse on South Head to the eastern heights of Rose Bay.  Wentworth carried out major building and ground works through 25 years of occupancy.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
*1828{{spaced endash}}Major additions to the house, including turrets, a large kitchen wing and convict barracks.  By the 1830s the Wentworth family had made many visible improvements, including turrets on the house, a [[sandstone]] stable in 1829 by architect George Cookney, a large kitchen wing and convict barracks.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; Vaucluse House and its furnishings were clearly intended to provide the correct social surroundings for Wentworth and his wife Sarah's immediate family of seven daughters and three sons. Sir Henry Browne Hayes' modest structure disappeared within the building fabric of the Wentworth's gothic mansion. The public areas were designed for effect and the Drawing and Dining Rooms, long hall and sweeping staircase was as fashionable as the Wentworth's taste would allow.  Vaucluse House was never completed due to factors which included the 1840s depression and Wentworth's intentions for a full facade, bedroom additions and formal entrance are unknown.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
*March 1853{{spaced endash}}the family sold most of the contents of the house by auction and moved to Europe. In December the house and 163 acres within the fences was leased to John Hosking for three years, a lease agreement requiring him to keep "the park, gardens, orangeries, vineyard and buildings, fencing, hedges, ditches, gates, bridges, [[stile]]s, rails, poles, posts and drains in good and sufficient order".&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;  When the Wentworths returned briefly in 1861–62, many improvements were made to the pleasure grounds.  The gothic revival iron verandah was built and fountain installed in the pleasure garden.  Renovations were necessary after several years of relative neglect by tenants, and the present iron verandah with its Gothic Revival [[columns]] replaced an earlier flat roofed verandah. Use of the estate grounds extended to the harbour side Beach Paddock. The family introduced new plantings to the gardens and orchards and innovations in fencing shaped and formalised the approaches to the property.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
*In 1900{{spaced endash}}the contents of the house were auctioned, and the house remained unoccupied until 1911.  Then some 28 acres (9ha) including house and garden, were resumed by the NSW Government for use as a public reserve.  Providing for the current needs took precedence over preservation and the ruins of the convict barracks, workers cottages, fences and stock [[shed]] were demolished.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
*1910–20{{spaced endash}}The Trust replaced the original gates with four sets of gates. The square pillars and iron gates of the original Vaucluse Estate entrance were removed from Vaucluse Road near Nielsen Park and resited near the original driveway at the intersection of Wentworth Road and Olola Avenue. The house, although virtually empty, was open on weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
*1917{{spaced endash}}two towers were added to the eastern facade  and the crenellations continued across the front facade to give a semblance of completeness. The character of the garden changed in detail more than layout'&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
*1920s{{spaced endash}}Changes to garden and carriage circle formalised with the removal of the Bunya Bunya Pine and construction of a grassed loop. By the mid 1920s almost all evidence of the Wentworth entry road had been lost and was replaced by Wentworth Road. Olola Avenue was built. Until this decade substantial areas of cleared land survived in the east and west.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
*Mid 1920s{{spaced endash}}Kiosk, toilets, cottage and greenhouse (since demolished) built. The kiosk (now tearooms) was built, new concrete pedestrian bridges built over the creek, and the ground level around the western side of the stables was radically altered for footpaths.  Original gravel paths were bitumenised, last remnants of the orchard and vineyard removed and the original entry drive disappeared.  Wentworth's precious bushland to the west and east was subdivided.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
*1930s{{spaced endash}}Depression era - much relief work activity in the park.  Concrete paths laid, stone walls contained the creek.  Much work was done on the carriage loop including building stone walls, kerbing and arbors.  An extensive rose garden was established in the central lawn.  A rockery was formed around the bakery and the garden embellished with beds of azaleas, cannas, cinerarias and begonias—changing the 19th century estate into a 20th-century municipal park.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1351&gt;Bravery, 1997, 5–8, 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
*During the 20th century{{spaced endash}}a number of typically characteristic and dominant plants have been removed from the grounds, the most important of these being:&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1337/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
** two Araucaria pines (in the front park and along Olola Avenue);
** a fig tree in the front park;
** two Magnolias to the west of the residence;
** willows (Salix sp.) along the creek.
*1940s{{spaced endash}}Walled enclosure  around store and west of kitchen built.  Further additions and alterations were made in the period up until 1966.
*1966{{spaced endash}}Wisteria removed from over the front verandah and replaced with hardier variety. Gardens formalised.&lt;ref name="nswshr-955-1351" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
*1996{{spaced endash}}large Moreton Bay fig between house and tea rooms was removed due to branch drop and poor condition. Cuttings from a branch were propagated and a new tree has been put back to replace it.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1353&gt;Gray, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;
*2000{{spaced endash}}kitchen garden re-created west of the creek, based on 19th century documentary and garden practise research, in an area adjacent to the wash house, across from the service courtyard of the house, and a small part of the original grid of orchards, vegetable plots and vineyard (since lost to carpark and lawns in north-western corner of current estate).&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
As at 31 May 2000, Vaucluse House was one of the few 19th century houses on Sydney Harbour retaining a significant part of its original estate setting.  One distinguishing surviving characteristic of the 19th century estate is its careful division into specific areas, both functional and ornamental, such as pleasure garden, kitchen garden, rear service yard, paddocks, carriageway, creek, estate backdrop, beach paddock.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NSW HHT, undated brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaucluse House is significant because of its association with the Wentworth family and their aspirations. It has a large collection of surviving original documentary evidence relating to the house, its contents and occupants. There are a number of extant buildings  and gardens and the house retains relative intactness of form, interior space and detailing predating 1900.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1354&gt;Bravery 1997:10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; A large early Victorian garden and shrubbery, laid out to compliment a gothic revival house belonging to the family of the important colonial pioneer and politician W. C. Wentworth.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; There appears little early documentation of the garden but it can be presumed to have been designed to complement the mid-19th century additions to the house and to have been established by the 1860s.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1355&gt;Survey of Gardens in NSW - National Trust, Broadbent, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; Vaucluse House was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

Vaucluse House was the family home of William Charles and Sarah Wentworth and their family, mainly from 1827–1853, and as such reflects the aspirations of a prominent political figure in mid 19th century NSW. It was during this period that Wentworth was arguably at his most prominent and influential in Australian society.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; It is Australia's first "House Museum", an important example of rare and forward thinking, public "preservation" and recreational planning of the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; With its family provenanced collection it demonstrates the way of life of the Wentworths, their taste incorporated with the taste of their time, social standing and status. The property, but particularly the house, reflects a statement of where the Wentworths aspired to be, as opposed to where they were placed because of their family history (perception of Sarah and William Charles Wentworth's family convict origins by Sydney society).&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; Extant buildings offer both "master and servant' perspectives on mid 19th century life.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The financial effects of the 1849s depression in Australia are apparent through the incompleteness of the building.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The building is an example of English Gothic Romanticism in Australia and reflects the aspirations of the Wentworths in asserting their social status.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The Vaucluse Site is significant because it is an example of a designed "Picturesque" landscape, including fountain and shrubbery, of the colonial period belonging to a prominent colonial family; it contains remnants and features of a "gardened site" begun in 1804 and shows the development of gardening styles, taste and necessity over fifty years; and it has strong association with the Wentworth family  such as the Mausoleum and [[Greycliffe House]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1354/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

The Vaucluse Site is significant because it provides the opportunity to demonstrate the architectural and functional interdependence of house, estate buildings and landscape setting in a colonial rural estate and therefore enables an understanding of the social and cultural values of the owners and their period.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; It provides an appropriately scaled setting for an important historic house.&lt;ref name="nswshr-955-1354" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

The Vaucluse Site is significant because the grounds, including the Beach Paddock, Tearooms and South Paddock stairs have provided a significant community recreational facility developed by Trustees for local residents and visitors since 1910.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The grounds have provided work for the local community since the early 19th century and reflected major social changes such as the 1930s depression.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; It provides extensive free access to the waterfront.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1354/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The house is significant because of the large surviving collection of original documentary evidence pertaining to the house, its occupants and the existence of provenanced objects.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The Vaucluse Site is significant because:&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The garden contains remnants of some native plantings now established, such as a c.1950 Norfolk Island Hibiscus and a c.1859 Port jackson Fig.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt; The Olola Avenue perimeter retains remnants of the indigenous vegetation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-955-1354/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The house is a rare example of a 19th-century marine villa with some extant buildings. The garden is a rare extant example of a garden belonging to a 19th-century mansion adjacent to the harbour which has not been entirely subdivided and which substantial&lt;ref name=nswshr-955/&gt;

'''Whole Wheat Radio''' was a not-for-profit, listener-driven [[online radio station|online]] [[community radio station]]&lt;ref name="social-customer" /&gt; from [[Talkeetna, Alaska]].&lt;ref name="adn-goes-live" /&gt; It was centered around [[independent music]], and aired 24 hours a day.&lt;ref name="pcmag" /&gt;

The station pioneered several social and technical [[webcast]] feats, including the use of [[MediaWiki|wiki software]] to collaboratively catalogue music,&lt;ref name="ktna-weather" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jwalk-wiki" /&gt; interactive house concerts where listeners could comment and tip the artists,&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; electronic [[disk jockey|DJs]] (dubbed "EJs"), listener phonegrams,&lt;ref name="podplayer" /&gt; and its recorded shows were among the first available [[podcasts]].&lt;ref name="docsearls" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ipodder" /&gt;

After eight years of uninterrupted broadcast, the station closed on October 20, 2010.&lt;ref name="goodbye-wwr" /&gt;

== History ==
Whole Wheat Radio began as "Radio Free Talkeetna" in August 2002.&lt;ref name="kenai-peninsula" /&gt; Software developer James (Jim) Kloss started the live interactive webcast immediately after [[digital subscriber line|DSL internet]] arrived in the small village of [[Talkeetna, Alaska]]. Jim was known online for his development of the nochange BBS&lt;ref name="bbs" /&gt; and XChange file transfer program.&lt;ref name="infoworld" /&gt; The site changed its name to Whole Wheat Radio by December 2002.&lt;ref name="anchorage-press" /&gt;

The site was first broadcast from an existing 12x12 foot cabin built by Jim's partner Esther Golton.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; In July 2004, a more permanent structure dubbed The Wheat Hole was built to accommodate an in-house audience of 50.&lt;ref name="anchorage-press" /&gt; In 2008, the venue was moved to a "renovated log saloon" dubbed The Wheat Palace to accommodate more patrons,&lt;ref name="adn-goes-live" /&gt; and to host other activities.&lt;ref name="adn-signs-off" /&gt;

== Music and Programming ==
[[Image:Cabin.jpg|thumb|right|The original 12x12 Whole Wheat Radio cabin]]

Whole Wheat Radio played [[independent music]], initially due to commercial licensing costs.&lt;ref name="anchorage-press" /&gt; The site evolved into a vehicle for promoting independent artists, helped by Jim's partner and musician Esther Golton. Artists gave permission and sent CDs for their music to be played on the station.&lt;ref name="thescope" /&gt;

Genres weren't restricted, but favoured [[acoustic music|acoustic]] and [[folk music]].&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="onlinefolkfestival" /&gt;

The site hosted numerous [[house concert]]s&lt;ref name="onlinefolkfestival" /&gt; which were broadcast live,&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; including [[Marian Call]],&lt;ref name="adn-coffeehouse" /&gt; [[Rod Picott]],&lt;ref name="flickr-picott-shires" /&gt; [[Jeffrey Foucault]],&lt;ref name="cdbaby-foucault" /&gt; [[Amanda Shires]],&lt;ref name="flickr-picott-shires" /&gt; and [[Danny Schmidt]].&lt;ref name="unsolicitedopinion-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="homer-news" /&gt; Proceeds from the concerts were given to the performers, often exceeding income artists grossed from traditional media events.&lt;ref name="adn-coffeehouse" /&gt;

The stream also included aspects of talk radio, from 15 minute rants&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; to full morning shows. After airing, these were taped and made available as podcasts.&lt;ref name="ipodder" /&gt;

== Technology and Community ==
[[Image:Grace at WWR.JPG|thumb|A volunteer reading on-air at Whole Wheat Radio]]

Whole Wheat Radio streamed 56kb/s [[mp3PRO]] audio using [[SHOUTcast]],&lt;ref name="shoutcast" /&gt; which could be accessed from any compatible [[streaming audio]] player compatible with the format. Clients without mp3PRO support fell back to an equivalent-quality 128kb/s MP3 stream.&lt;ref name="shoutcast-formats" /&gt;

A custom install of [[MediaWiki]] ran the user-editable music database,&lt;ref name="anchorage-press" /&gt; the same software that operates [[Wikipedia]], [[Wiktionary]] and other [[Wikimedia Foundation]] projects. Listeners (affectionately dubbed Wheatheads)&lt;ref name="adn-signs-off" /&gt; were encouraged to add tags, lyrics, art, ratings and other information to song, album and artist pages. The currently-playing song was displayed on the home and chat pages, with links to these resources for more information.&lt;ref name="anchorage-press" /&gt;

The site accepted regular submissions for logos, which were rotated regularly.&lt;ref name="jwalk-logos" /&gt;

Wheatheads could call in phonegrams that were played automatically on the stream,&lt;ref name="podplayer" /&gt; or leave a comment in the chat system for an EJ to read on air. Text based games (and later, rewards for collaborating on articles) would let Wheatheads accrue "wheatberries", an early form of web [[gamification]].

Separate podcast feeds were available for each of the shows shortly after they had aired live, such as the "Rant-N-Ravin' Muffin News".&lt;ref name="wwr-rss1" /&gt; and house concerts.

== Reception ==
In 2005, Whole Wheat Radio was discussed in an episode of [[The Dawn and Drew Show]],&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; and in an interview with Derek and Swoopy from the [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic Magazines']] [[Skepticality]] podcast.&lt;ref name="skepticality" /&gt;

Journalist [[Doc Searls]] commented in 2004 that "it's an outstanding station. If you miss KPIG's live Webcast, Whole Wheat Radio will ease your surcease. You might think of WWR as folksy or charming (it's both). I think of them as heroic. What they do is the very, very best of what radio is all about."&lt;ref name="docsearls" /&gt;

In an article for [[PC World]], [[Derek Sivers]] of [[CDBaby]] commented that "online radio is the best way to find new music and [I recommend] indie-flavored Whole Wheat Radio".&lt;ref name="pcmag" /&gt;

== Conclusion ==
In 2010, Jim pushed for a greater emphasis on the site mission of helping independent artists over the chat aspects of the site. This generated animosity, culminating in an unsanctioned, separate Facebook group. Jim closed the site soon after, claiming he no longer loved the job.&lt;ref name="adn-signs-off" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wwr-historical" /&gt;

The Wheat Palace continued to hold private parties, meetings, classes and art showings through 2011.&lt;ref name="adn-signs-off" /&gt;
