[[File:Map of the offshore wind power farms in the German Bight.png|thumb|240px|Amrumbank West's location in the wind farms of the German Bight]]
'''Amrumbank West''' in a German [[offshore wind farm]] in the [[North Sea]] owned by [[E.ON]]. 
It is located about 35&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the island of [[Heligoland]] and around 18&amp;nbsp;km south-west of the [[Amrum Bank]] sandbank. 
It consists of 80 turbines in waters 19–24 m deep.&lt;ref name=geo&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/1468-6996/16/3/034605|pmid=27877792|pmc=5099829| title = Geosynthetics in geoenvironmental engineering| journal = Science and Technology of Advanced Materials| volume = 16| issue = 3| pages = 034605| year = 2015| last1 = Müller | first1 = W.

==Construction==
Construction cost was around {{euro|1 billion}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eon.com/content/dam/eon-com/en/downloads/1/111216_Factsheet_Amrumbank_dt.pdf ''Factsheet Amrumbank West''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924001400/http://www.eon.com/content/dam/eon-com/en/downloads/1/111216_Factsheet_Amrumbank_dt.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }} (PDF; 1,2&amp;nbsp;MB). Eon, retrieved 21 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The project was delayed 15 months by the lack of power lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/energy/german-wind-energy-plans-in-the-doldrums German wind energy plans in the doldrums]. Thenational.ae (6 March 2012). Retrieved on 2015-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 80 wind turbines are Siemens SWT-3.6–120 with a rated power of 3.6 MW and a rotor diameter of 120 meters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siemens.com/press/de/pressemitteilungen/?press=/de/pressemitteilungen/2011/energy/wind-power/ewp201112021.htm ''Siemens sichert sich Auftrag für Offshore-Windkraftwerk in Deutschland.''] Siemens, 15 December 2011, retrieved 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Offshore construction began in 2013, and the first turbine was installed in February 2015. 
The wind farm was commissioned at the end of 2015.

==Seabed protection==
[[File:Geoprotection of off-shore wind energy turbines.png|thumb|240px|Installation of turbine piles at Amrumbank West through the erosion protection layers.&lt;ref name=geo/&gt;]]
The seabed surface at the construction site mainly consists of sand. It was initially reinforced by a 2.4-m-thick layer of large stones. However, this hindered installation of the turbine piles, which should be driven through the protection layer deep into the seabed. Therefore, stones were replaced by two layers of [[geotextile]] containers, i.e., sandbags made of a special damage-resistant nonwoven geotextile. Empty bags had a size of 1.45 × 2.38 m and could accommodate 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of sand; they were filled on the [[Rømø]] island up to 80 vol% and weighed 1400 kg each. The seabed protection withstood the [[St. Jude storm]] in October 2013 and [[Cyclone Xaver]] in December 2013. Starting from December 2013, turbine piles 6 m in diameter were driven through the erosion protection layers.&lt;ref name=geo/&gt;

[[Image:Net Wrapped Small Round Bale Being Ejected.gif|right|thumb|320px|An Abbriata Roto-Baler ejecting a net-wrapped small round bale]]

A '''baler''', most often called a '''hay baler''' &lt;!--reedirects here---&gt; is a piece of [[farm machinery]] used to compress a cut and raked crop (such as [[hay]], [[cotton]], [[flax]]  [[straw]], salt marsh hay, or [[silage]]) into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport, and store. Often, bales are configured to dry and preserve some intrinsic (e.g. the nutritional) value of the plants bundled. Several different types of balers are commonly used, each producing a different type of bale &amp;ndash; rectangular or cylindrical, of various sizes, bound with [[twine]], [[strapping]],  [[netting]], or [[baling wire|wire]].

Industrial balers are also used in material [[Materials recovery facility|recycling facilities]], primarily for baling metal, plastic, or paper for transport.

==History==
Before the 19th century, hay was cut by hand and most typically stored in haystacks using hay forks to rake and gather the scythed grasses into optimal sized heaps &amp;mdash; neither too large (promoting conditions that might create spontaneous combustion), nor too small, so much of the pile is susceptible to rotting. These haystacks lifted most of the plant fibers up off the ground, letting air in and water drain out, so the grasses could dry and cure, to retain nutrition for livestock feed at a later time. In the 1860s, mechanical cutting devices were developed; from these came the modern devices including mechanical mowers and balers. In 1872, a reaper that used a knotter device to bundle and bind hay was invented by Charles Withington; this was commercialized in 1874 by [[Cyrus McCormick]].&lt;ref name="bridon"&gt;Bridon Cordage, [http://www.bridoncordage.com/history_twine.html The role of twine in North American agriculture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222125539/http://www.bridoncordage.com/history_twine.html |date=2012-02-22 }}" (accessed Jan 14, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Innes invented an automatic baler that tied bales with twine using Appleby-type knotters from a John Deere grain binder; In 1938 Edwin Nolt filed a patent&lt;ref name="noltpatent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c9/15/66/bf7e71e31d796f/US2236628.pdf|title=Means for Baling Material}}&lt;/ref&gt; for an improved version that was more reliable.&lt;ref name="bridon" /&gt; 
 The first round baler was probably invented in the late 19th century and one was shown in Paris by Pilter (as illustrated by Michael Williams in Steam Power in Agriculture: Blandford, 1977). This was a portable machine designed for use with threshing machines. 

==Round baler==
[[Image:AllisChalmers Rotobaler2.jpg|right|thumb|Allis Chalmers Rotobaler]]
[[Image:Rundballenpresse.gif|left|thumb|Round baler dumping a fresh bale]]
The most common type of baler in industrialized countries today is the round baler. It produces cylinder-shaped "round" or "rolled" bales. The design has a "thatched roof" effect that withstands weather well.&lt;ref name="ag.iastate.edu"/&gt; Grass is rolled up inside the baler using rubberized belts, fixed rollers, or a combination of the two. When the bale reaches a predetermined size, either netting or [[twine]] is wrapped around it to hold its shape. The back of the baler swings open, and the bale is discharged. The bales are complete at this stage, but they may also be wrapped in plastic sheeting by a [[bale wrapper]], either to keep hay dry when stored outside or convert damp grass into [[silage]]. Variable-chamber large round balers typically produce bales from {{convert|48|to|72|in|cm}} in diameter and up to {{convert|60|in|cm}} in width. The bales can weigh anywhere from {{convert|1100|to|2200|lb|kg}}, depending upon size, material, and [[moisture content]]. Common modern small round balers (also called "mini round balers" or "roto-balers") produce bales {{convert|20|to|22|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|20.5|to|28|in|cm}} in width, generally weighing from {{convert|40|to|55|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodwin|first1=Pat|title=Buyer's Guide: Hay Equipment for Compact Tractors|url=http://tractortoolsdirect.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hay-Equipment-for-Compact-Tractors-Buyers-Guide-Extension-outreach-SMALLER.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally conceived by Ummo Luebben circa 1910, the first round baler did not see production until 1947 when [[Allis-Chalmers]] introduced the Roto-Baler. Marketed for the water-shedding and light weight properties of its hay bales, AC had sold nearly 70,000 units by the end of production in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toytractorshow.com/ac_inovation.htm|title=Allis-Chalmers Innovation |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next major innovation began in 1965 when a graduate student at Iowa State University, Virgil Haverdink, sought out Wesley F. Buchele, a professor of Agricultural Engineering, seeking a research topic for a master thesis.&lt;ref name="ag.iastate.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.iastate.edu/coa150/buchele.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224122555/http://www.ag.iastate.edu/coa150/buchele.php |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.iastate.edu/coa150/pop10_8.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224114153/http://www.ag.iastate.edu/coa150/pop10_8.php |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next year Buchele and Haverdink developed a new design for a large round baler, completed and tested in 1966, and thereafter dubbed the Buchele-Haverdink large round baler.&lt;ref name="ag.iastate.edu"/&gt;  The large round bales were about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter, {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} long, and they weighed about {{convert|270|kg|lb|abbr=off}} after they dried—about 80&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3 (&lt;/sup&gt;5&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3)&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Why%20the%20large%20round%20bale?%20A%20little%20hay%20history.-a0128059669|title=Why the large round bale? A little hay history. - Free Online Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was promoted as a "Whale of a Bale" and Iowa State University now explains the innovative design as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
"Farmers were saved from the backbreaking chore of slinging hay bales in the 1960s, when Iowa State agricultural engineering professor Wesley Buchele and a group of student researchers invented a baler that produced large, round bales that could be moved by tractor. The baler has become the predominant forage-handling machine in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps/memorials/marker.asp?id=15-01|title=Innovative Baler|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the summer of 1969, the Australian Econ Fodder Roller baler came out, a design that made a {{convert|135|kg|lb|abbr=on}} ground-rolled bale. In September of that same year, The Hawkbilt Company of Vinton, Iowa, contacted Dr. Buchele about his design, then fabricated a large ground-rolling round baler which baled hay that had been laid out in a [[windrow]], and began manufacturing large round balers in 1970.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"/&gt; In 1972, Gary Vermeer of Pella, Iowa, designed and fabricated a round baler after the design of the A-C Roto-Baler, and the [[Vermeer Company]] began selling its model 605 - the first modern round baler. The Vermeer design used belts to compact hay into a cylindrical shape as is seen today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vermeerag.com/history/1972.cfm|title=1972 |accessdate=January 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924013317/http://www.vermeerag.com/history/1972.cfm |archivedate=September 24, 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s, collaboration between [[Eaton Corporation|Walterscheid]] and Vermeer produced the first effective uses of [[CV joint]]s in balers, and later in other farm machinery. Due to the heavy torque required for such equipment, double Cardan joints are primarily used. Former Walterscheid engineer Martin Brown is credited with "inventing" this use for universal joints.

By 1975, fifteen American and Canadian companies were manufacturing large round balers.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary.com"/&gt;

===Transport, handling, and feeding===

==== Short-haul transport and on-field handling ====
[[Image:Round hay bale at dawn02.jpg|left|thumb|A large round bale]]
Due to the ability for round bales to roll away on a slope, they require specific treatment for safe transport and handling. Small round bales can typically be moved by hand or with lower-powered equipment. Large round bales, due to their size and weight (they can weigh a ton or more) require special transport and moving equipment.

The most important tool for large round bale handling is the [[bale spear]] or spike, which is usually mounted on the back of a tractor or the front of a [[skid-steer]]. It is inserted into the approximate center of the round bale, then lifted and the bale is hauled away. Once at the destination, the bale is set down, and the spear pulled out. Careful placement of the spear in the center is needed or the bale can spin around and touch the ground while in transport, causing a loss of control. When used for wrapped bales that are to be stored further, the spear makes a hole in the wrapping that must be sealed with plastic tape to maintain a hermetic seal.

Alternatively, a [[grapple fork]] may be used to lift and transport large round bales. The grapple fork is a hydraulically driven implement attached to the end of a tractor's bucket loader. When the hydraulic cylinder is extended, the fork clamps downward toward the bucket, much like a closing hand. To move a large round bale, the tractor approaches the bale from the side and places the bucket underneath the bale. The fork is then clamped down across the top of the bale, and the bucket is lifted with the bale in tow. Grab hooks installed on the bucket of a tractor are another tool used to handle round bales, and be done by a farmer with welding skills by welding two hooks and a heavy chain to the outside top of a tractor front loader bucket.

==== Long-haul transport ====
The rounded surface of round bales poses a challenge for long-haul, flat-bed transport, as they could roll off of the flat surface if not properly supported. This is particularly the case with large round bales; their size makes them difficult to flip, so it may not be feasible to flip many of them onto the flat surface for transport and then re-position them on the round surface at the destination. One option that works with both large and small round bales is to equip the flat-bed trailer with guard-rails at either end, which prevent bales from rolling either forward or backward. Another solution is the saddle wagon, which has closely spaced rounded saddles or support posts in which round bales sit. The tall sides of each saddle prevent the bales from rolling around while on the wagon, as the bale settles down in between posts. On 3 September 2010, on the A381 in Halwell near [[Totnes]], [[Devon]], UK an early member of British rock group [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]] Mike Edwards was killed when his van was crushed by a large round bale. The cellist, 62, died instantly when the {{convert|600|kg|lb|adj=on}} bale fell from a tractor on nearby farmland before rolling onto the road and crushing his van.&lt;ref&gt;ELO's Mike Edwards killed by hay bale in freak crash at bbc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feeding ====
A large round bale can be directly used for feeding animals by placing it in a feeding area, tipping it over, removing the bale wrap, and placing a protective ring (a ''ring feeder'') around the outside so that animals don't walk on hay that has been peeled off the outer perimeter of the bale. The round baler's rotational forming and compaction process also enables both large and small round bales to be fed out by unrolling the bale, leaving a continuous flat strip in the field or behind a feeding barrier.

===Silage or haylage===
[[File:High Moisture Round Bale - Pickup and Wrapping 320k.ogg|thumb|320px|Video: Picking up and applying plastic cling wrap to a round bale.]]
[[File:High Moisture Round Bale - Sealing Bales Together 320k.ogg|thumb|320px|Video: Sealing the wrapped bales together.]]
A recent{{When|date=August 2009}} innovation in hay storage has been the development of the silage or haylage bale, which is a high-moisture bale wrapped in plastic film. These are baled much wetter than hay bales, and are usually smaller than hay bales because the greater moisture content makes them heavier and harder to handle. These bales begin to ferment almost immediately, and the metal bale spear stabbed into the core becomes very warm to the touch from the fermentation process.

Silage or haylage bales may be wrapped by placing them on a rotating bale spear mounted on the rear of a tractor. As the bale spins, a layer of plastic cling film is applied to the exterior of the bale. This roll of plastic is mounted in a sliding shuttle on a steel arm and can move parallel to the bale axis, so the operator does not need to hold up the heavy roll of plastic. The plastic layer extends over the ends of the bale to form a ring of plastic approximately {{convert|12|in|cm}} wide on the ends, with hay exposed in the center.

To stretch the cling-wrap plastic tightly over the bale, the tension is actively adjusted with a knob on the end of the roll, which squeezes the ends of the roll in the shuttle. In this example wrapping video, the operator is attempting to use high tension to get a flat, smooth seal on the right end. However, the tension increases too much and the plastic tears off. The operator recovers by quickly loosening the tension and allows the plastic to feed out halfway around the bale before reapplying the tension to the sheeting.

These bales are placed in a long continuous row, with each wrapped bale pressed firmly against all the other bales in the row before being set down onto the ground. The plastic wrap on the ends of each bale sticks together to seal out air and moisture, protecting the silage from the elements. The end-bales are hand-sealed with strips of cling plastic across the opening.

The airtight seal between each bale permits the row of round bales to ferment as if they were in a [[silo bag]], but they are easier to handle than a silo bag, as they are more robust and compact. The plastic usage is relatively high, and there is no way to reuse the silage-contaminated plastic sheeting, although it can be [[recycling|recycled]] or used as a fuel source via [[incineration]]. The wrapping cost is approximately US$5 per bale.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

An alternative form of wrapping uses the same type of bale placed on a [[bale wrapper]], consisting of pair of rollers on a turntable mounted on the three-point linkage of a tractor. It is then spun about two axes while being wrapped in several layers of cling-wrap plastic film. This covers the ends and sides of the bale in one operation, thus sealing it separately from other bales. The bales are then moved or stacked using a special pincer attachment on the front loader of a tractor, which does not damage the film seal. They can also be moved using a standard bale spike, but this punctures the airtight seal, and the hole in the film must be repaired after each move.

Plastic-wrapped bales must be unwrapped before being fed to livestock to prevent accidental ingestion of the plastic. Like round hay bales, silage bales are usually fed using a ''ring feeder''.
[[Image:Großballenpresse.jpg|right|thumb|Large rectangular baler.]]

==Large rectangular baler==
In 1978, Hesston introduced the first "large square baler," capable of compacting hay into more easily transported large square bales that could be stacked and tarped in the field (to protect them from rain) or loaded on trucks or containers for trucking or export. Depending upon the baler, these bales can weigh from 1000 pounds to 2200 pounds for a 3'x3'x9' or 3'x4'x9' bale (versus 900 pounds for a 3'x4' round bale). As the pickup revolves just above the ground surface, the tines pick up and feed the hay into the flake forming chamber, where a "flake" of hay is formed before being pushed up into the path of the plunger, which then compresses it with great force (200 to over 750 kilonewtons, depending on model) against the existing bale in the chamber. Once the desired length is achieved, the knotter arm is mechanically tripped to begin the knotting cycle in which several knotters (4-6 is common) tie the 4-6 strings that maintain the bale's shape.

In the prairies of Canada, the large rectangular balers are also called "prairie [[wikt:raptor|raptor]]s".

==Rectangular bale handling and transport==
[[File:Ronsenac Mur de balles 2013.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2|Large rectangular bales in a field, [[Charente (département)|Charente]], France. Sizes of stacks of baled hay need to be carefully managed, as the curing process is exothermic and the built up heat around internal bales can reach ignition temperatures in the right weather history and atmospheric conditions. Building a deep stack either too wide, or too high increases the risk of spontaneous ignition.]]
Rectangular bales are easier to transport than round bales, since there is little risk of the bale rolling off the back of a flatbed trailer. The rectangular shape also saves space and allows a complete solid slab of hay to be stacked for transport and storage. Most balers allow adjustment of length and it is common to produce bales of twice the width, allowing stacks with brick-like alternating groups overlapping the row below at right angles, creating a strong structure.

They are well-suited for large-scale livestock [[feedlot]] operations, where many tons of feed are rationed every hour. Most often, they are baled small enough that one person can carry or toss them where needed.

Due to the huge rectangular shape, large spear forks, or squeeze grips are mounted to heavy lifting machinery, such as large fork lifts, tractors equipped with front end loaders, telehandlers, hay squeezes or wheel loaders, to lift these bales.

==Small rectangular baler==
[[File:Small rect kick baling ff 0.25 320x240 aud 1 vid 3.ogv|frame|Video of baling with a kick baler, and unloading into a barn with a hay elevator. (See [[:File:Small rect kick baling ff 0.25 320x240 aud 1 vid 3.ogv|file description]] for links to larger and higher quality videos.)]]
[[Image:IHSquareBalerJuly2004.jpg|right|thumb|A small square baler (International model 435)]]
A type of baler that produces small rectangular (often called "square") bales was once the most prevalent form of baler, but is less common today. It is primarily used on small acreages where large equipment is impractical, and also for the production of hay for small operations, particularly [[horse]] owners who may not have access to the specialized feeding machinery used for larger bales. Each bale is about {{convert|15|x|18|x|40|in|cm}}. The bales are usually wrapped with two, but sometimes three, or more strands of knotted twine. The bales are light enough for one person to handle, about {{convert|45|to|60|lb|kg}}, depending upon the crop and pressure applied (can be 100 lbs for a 16"x18" 2-string bale). Many balers have adjustable bale chamber pressure and bale length, so shorter, less-dense bales can be produced for ease of handling.

To form the bale, the material to be baled (which is often hay or straw) in the [[windrow]] is lifted by tines in the baler's ''reel''. This material is then ''packed'' into the bale chamber, which runs the length of one side of the baler (normally the right hand side when viewed from the front) in offset balers. Balers like Hesston models use an in-line system where the hay goes straight through from the pickup to the flake chamber to the plunger and bale-forming chamber. A combination plunger and knife move back and forth in the front of this chamber, with the knife closing the door into the bale chamber as it moves backwards. The plunger and knife are attached to a heavy asymmetrical flywheel to provide extra force as they pack the bales. A measuring device—normally a spiked wheel that is turned by the emerging bales—measures the amount of material that is being compressed and, at the appropriate length it triggers the ''knotters'' that wrap the twine around the bale and tie it off. As the next bale is formed the tied one is driven out of the rear of the baling chamber, where it can either drop to the ground, or sent to a wagon towed behind the baler. When a wagon is used, the bale may be lifted by hand from the chamber by a worker on the wagon who stacks the bales on the wagon, or the bale may be propelled into the wagon by a mechanism on the baler, commonly either a "thrower" (parallel high-speed drive belts which throw the bale into the wagon) or a "kicker" (mechanical arm which throws the bale into the wagon). In the case of a thrower or kicker, the wagon has high walls on the left, right, and back sides, and a short wall on the front side, to contain the randomly piled bales. This process continues as long as there is material to be baled, and twine to tie it with.

This form of bale is not much used in large-scale commercial agriculture, because of the costs involved in handling many small bales. However, it enjoys some popularity in small-scale, low-mechanization agriculture and horse-keeping. Besides using simpler machinery and being easy to handle, these small bales can also be used for insulation and building materials in [[straw-bale construction]]. Square bales may generally weather better than round bales because a more much dense stack can be put up.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} However, they don't shed water as round bales do. Convenience is also a major factor in farmers deciding to continue putting up square bales, as they make feeding and bedding in confined areas (stables, barns, etc.) much easier.

Many of these older balers are still to be found on farms today, particularly in dry areas, where bales can be left outside for long periods.

The automatic-baler for small square bales took on most of its present form in 1938 with the first such baler sold as Arthur S. Young's Automation Baler. It was manufactured in small numbers until acquired by ''[[New Holland Ag]].''

In Europe, in as early as 1939, both [[Claas]] of Germany and Rousseau SA of France had automatic twine tying pick-up balers. Most of these produced low density bales though. The first successful pick-up balers were made by the Ann Arbor Company in 1929. Ann Arbor was acquired by the [[Oliver Farm Equipment Company]] in 1943. Despite their head start on the rest of the field, no Ann Arbor balers carried automatic knotters or twisters and Oliver didn't produce its own automatic tying baler until 1949.

===Hay presses, wire balers===
[[Image:Historic baler.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Stationary baler]]
Prior to 1937 the hay press was the common name of the stationary baling implement, powered with a tractor or stationary engine using a belt on a [[flat-belt pulley|belt pulley]], with the hay being brought to the baler and fed in by hand. Later, balers were made mobile, with a 'pickup' to gather up the hay and feed it into the chamber. These often used air cooled gasoline engines mounted on the baler for power. The biggest change to this type of baler since 1940 is being powered by the [[tractor]] through its [[power take-off]] (PTO), instead of by a built-in internal combustion engine.

In present-day production, small square balers can be ordered with twine knotters or wire tie knotters.

Not all stationary wire tying balers used 2 wires. It was not uncommon for the larger bale size (usually 17" x 22") machines to use 'boards' that had three slots for wires and hence tied three wires per bale. Most North American manufacturers produced these machines as either regular models or as size options. 'Small square' three wire tying pick-up balers were available from the early 1930s, principally from [[Case Corporation|J. I. Case &amp; Co.]] and [[Ann Arbor (automobile)|Ann Arbor]]. These machines were hand tying and hand threading machines.

==Square/wire bale history==

=== Pickup and handling methods===
In the 1940s most farmers would bale hay in the field with a small tractor with 20 or less horsepower, and the tied bales would be dropped onto the ground as the baler moved through the field. Another team of workers with horses and a flatbed wagon would come by and use a sharp metal hook to grab the bale and throw it up onto the wagon while an assistant stacks the bale, for transport to the barn.

A later time-saving innovation was to tow the flatbed wagon directly behind the baler, and the bale would be pushed up a ramp to a waiting attendant on the wagon. The attendant hooks the bale off the ramp and stacks it on the wagon, while waiting for the next bale to be produced.

Eventually, as tractor horsepower increased, the thrower-baler became possible, which eliminated the need for someone to stand on the wagon and pick up the finished bales. The first thrower mechanism used two fast-moving friction belts to grab finished bales and throw them at an angle up in the air onto the bale wagon. The bale wagon was modified from a flatbed into a three-sided skeleton frame open at the front, to act as a catcher's net for the thrown bales.

As tractor horsepower further increased, the next innovation of the thrower-baler was the hydraulic tossing baler. This employs a flat pan behind the bale knotter. As bales advance out the back of the baler, they are pushed onto the pan one at a time. When the bale has moved fully onto the pan, the pan suddenly pops up, pushed by a large [[hydraulic cylinder]], and tosses the bale up into the wagon like a [[catapult]].

The pan-thrower method puts much less stress on the bales compared to the belt-thrower. The friction belts of the belt-thrower stress the twine and knots as they grip the bale, and would occasionally cause bales to break apart in the thrower or when the bales landed in the wagon.

[[File:Stacker.jpg|thumb|Square bale stacker]]
[[File:Stacking Square Bales - geograph.org.uk - 1444507.jpg|thumb|A smaller type of stacker]]
Bales may be picked up from the field and stacked using a self-powered machine called a ''bale stacker'', ''bale wagon'' or ''harobed''. There are several designs and sizes. One type picks up square bales are dropped by the baler with the strings facing upward. The stacker will drive up to each bale, pick it up and set it on a three-bale-wide table (the strings are now facing upwards). Once three bales are on the table, the table lifts up and back, causing the three bales to face strings to the side again; this happens three more times until there are 16 bales on the main table. This table will lift like the smaller one, and the bales will be up against a vertical table. The machine will hold 160 bales (ten tiers); usually there will be cross-tiers near the center to keep the stack from swaying or collapsing if any weight is applied to the top of the stack. The full load will be transported to a barn; the whole rear of the stacker will tilt upwards until it is vertical. There will be two pushers that will extend through the machine and hold the bottom of the stack from being pulled out from the stacker while it is driven out of the barn.

In Britain (if small square bales are still to be used), they are usually collected as they fall out of the baler in a ''bale sledge'' dragged behind the baler. This has four channels, controlled by automatic mechanical balances, catches and springs, which sort each bale into its place in a square ''eight''. When the sledge is full, a catch is tripped automatically, and a door at the rear opens to leave the eight lying neatly together on the ground. These may be picked up individually and loaded by hand, or they may be picked up all eight together by a ''bale grab'' on a tractor, a special [[Loader (equipment)|front loader]] consisting of many hydraulically powered downward-pointing curved spikes. The square eight will then be stacked, either on a trailer for transport, or in a roughly cubic field stack eight or ten layers high. This cube may then be transported by a large machine attached to the [[three-point hitch]] behind a tractor, which clamps the sides of the cube and lifts it bodily.

===Storage methods===
Before [[rural electrification|electrification]] occurred in rural parts of the United States in the 1940s, some small dairy farms would have tractors but not electric power. Often just one neighbor who could afford a tractor would do all the baling for surrounding farmers still using horses.

To get the bales up into the hayloft, a pulley system ran on a track along the peak of the barn's hayloft. This track also stuck a few feet out the end of the loft, with a large access door under the track. On the bottom of the pulley system was a bale spear, which is pointed on the end and has retractable retention spikes.

A flatbed wagon would pull up next to the barn underneath the end of the track, the spear lowered down to the wagon, and speared into a single bale. The pulley rope would be used to manually lift the bale up until it could enter the mow through the door, then moved along the track into the barn and finally released for manual stacking in tight rows across the floor of the loft. As the stack filled the loft, the bales would be lifted higher and higher with the pulleys until the hay was stacked all the way up to the peak.

When electricity arrived, the bale spear, pulley and track system were replaced by long motorized bale conveyors known as hay elevators. A typical elevator is an open skeletal frame, with a chain that has dull {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} spikes every few feet along the chain to grab bales and drag them along. One elevator replaced the spear track and ran the entire length of the peak of the barn. A second elevator was either installed at a 30-degree slope on the side of the barn to lift bales up to the peak elevator, or used dual front-back chains surrounding the bale to lift bales straight up the side of the barn to the peak elevator.

A bale wagon pulled up next to the lifting elevator, and a farm worker placed bales one at a time onto the angled track. Once bales arrived at the peak elevator, adjustable tipping gates along the length of the peak elevator were opened by pulling a cable from the floor of the hayloft, so that bales tipped off the elevator and dropped down to the floor in different areas of the loft. This permitted a single elevator to transport hay to one part of a loft and straw to another part.

This complete hay elevator lifting, transport, and dropping system reduced bale storage labor to a single person, who simply pulls up with a wagon, turns on the elevators and starts placing bales on it, occasionally checking to make sure that bales are falling in the right locations in the loft.

The neat stacking of bales in the loft is often sacrificed for the speed of just letting them fall and roll down the growing pile in the loft, and changing the elevator gates to fill in open areas around the loose pile. But if desired, the loose bale pile dropped by the elevator could be rearranged into orderly rows between wagon loads.

===Usage once in the barn===
The process of retrieving bales from a hayloft has stayed relatively unchanged from the beginning of baling. Typically workers were sent up into the loft, to climb up onto the bale stack, pull bales off the stack, and throw or roll them down the stack to the open floor of the loft. Once the bale is down on the floor, workers climb down the stack, open a cover over a bale chute in the floor of the loft, and push the bales down the chute to the livestock area of the barn.

Most barns were equipped with several chutes along the sides and in the center of the loft floor. This permitted bales to be dropped into the area where they were to be used. Hay bales would be dropped through side chutes, to be broken up and fed to the cattle. Straw bales would be dropped down the center chute, to be distributed as bedding in the livestock standing/resting areas.

Traditionally multiple bales were dropped down to the livestock floor and the twine removed by hand. After drying and being stored under tons of pressure in the haystack, most bales are tightly compacted and need to be torn apart and fluffed up for use.

One recent method of speeding up all this manual bale handling is the bale shredder, which is a large vertical drum with rotary cutting/ripping teeth at the base of the drum. The shredder is placed under the chute and several bales dropped in. A worker then pushes the shredder along the barn aisle as it rips up a bale and spews it out in a continuous fluffy stream of material.

==Industrial balers==
[[Image:Baler Poly Packer.jpg|left|thumb|A specialized baler designed to compact [[stretch wrap]].]]

Industrial balers are typically used to compact similar types of waste, such as [[Paper|office paper]], [[Corrugated fiberboard]], [[plastic]], foil and cans, for sale to recycling companies. These balers are made of [[steel]] with a [[hydraulic ram]] to compress the material loaded. Some balers are simple and labor-intensive, but are suitable for smaller volumes. Other balers are very complex and automated, and are used where large quantities of waste are handled.

Used in recycling facilities, balers are a packaging step that allows for the aforementioned commodities to be broken down into dense cubes of one type of material at a time. There are different balers used depending on the material type. After a specific material is crushed down into a dense cube, it is tied to a bale by a thick wire and then pushed out of the machine. This process allows for easy transport of all materials involved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6473">'''Contact protection''' methods are designed to limit the wear and degradation that occur during the normal use of contacts within an electromechanical [[switch]], [[relay]] or [[contactor]].

==Contact wear==
[[File:Contacts - new and used.jpg|right|thumb|300px|From left to right: {{ordered list |1=Pristine contacts from a relay |2=The nearly destroyed contacts from a relay operated under power for nearly 100,000 cycles}}]]
Every time the contacts of an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] switch, relay or contactor are opened or closed, there is a certain amount of contact wear.  The sources of the wear are high [[Current density|current densities]] in microscopic areas, and the [[electric arc]].  Contact wear includes material transfer between contacts, loss of contact material due to splattering and evaporation, and oxidation or corrosion of the contacts due to high temperatures and atmospheric influences.

While a pair of contacts is closed, only a small part of the contacts are in intimate contact due to [[Asperity (materials science)|asperities]] and low-conductivity films.  Because of the constriction of the current to a very small area, the [[current density]] frequently becomes so high that it melts a microscopic portion of the contact.  During the close-to-open (break) transition, a microscopic molten bridge forms and eventually ruptures asymmetrically, transferring contact material between contacts and increasing the surface roughness.  This can also occur during the open-to-close (make) transition due to [[contact bounce]].

The [[electric arc]] occurs between the contact points (electrodes) both during the transition from closed to open (break) and from open to closed (make) when the contact gap is small and the voltage is high enough.  Heating due to arcing and high current density can melt the contact surface temporarily.  If some of the melting material solidifies while the contacts are closed, the contact may stick closed due to a micro-weld, similar to [[spot welding]].

The arc caused during the contact break (break arc) is similar to [[arc welding]], as the break arc is typically more energetic and more destructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The arc can cause material transfer between contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pepbrainin.com/technical-resources/troubleshooting-common-electrical-contact-problems/|title=Troubleshooting Common Electrical Contact Problems|date=2013-12-13|work=PEP Brainin|access-date=2017-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The arc may also be hot enough to evaporate metal from the contact surface.

The high temperatures can also cause the contact metals to more rapidly oxidize and corrode.

Contacts reach end of life for one of two reasons.  Either the contacts fail to break because they are stuck (welded) closed, or the contacts fail to make (high resistance) because of contact corrosion or because excessive material is lost from one or both contacts. These conditions are the result of cumulative material transfer during successive switching operations, and of material loss due to evaporation and splattering.&lt;ref name="RelayLife"&gt;{{cite web | title = Relay Contact Life | author=  | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.te.com/usa-en/products/relays-contactors-switches/relays/intersection/application-notes.html | accessdate = January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are additional mechanisms for stuck closed failures, such as mechanical interlocking of rough contact surfaces due to contact wear.

==Protection==

The degradation of the contacts can be limited by including various contact protection methods.

One method is to add electronic components such as: [[capacitor]]s, [[snubber]]s, [[diode]]s, [[Zener diode]]s, [[transient voltage suppressor|transient voltage suppressors (TVS)]], [[resistor]]s, [[varistor]]s, in-rush current limiters [[Temperature coefficient#Positive temperature coefficient of resistance|PTC]] resistors, [[Temperature coefficient#Negative temperature coefficient|NTC]] resistors, voltage-dependent resistors.&lt;ref&gt;Tyco P&amp;B, Relay Contact Life, Tyco Electronics Corporation – P&amp;B, Winston-Salem, NC, Application Note 13C3236, pgs. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is the least effective method as these do neither significantly influence the creation nor suppress the arc between the contacts of the electromechanical power switches, relays and contactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Snubber Myth | author=   | publisher =  | date = | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/the-snubber-myth/ | accessdate = February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly more effective method is to make the contacts themselves larger, i.e., a contactor.&lt;ref&gt;Terrell Croft and Wilford Summers (ed), American Electricans' Handbook, Eleventh Edition, McGraw Hill, New York (1987) {{ISBN|0-07-013932-6}} page 7-124&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar method to increasing contact size is to make the contacts out of more durable metals or metal alloys such as tungsten.&lt;ref name="RelayLife"/&gt;

The most effective methods are to employ [[arc suppression]] circuitry including arc suppressors, solid state relays, hybrid power relays, mercury displacement relays and hybrid power contactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Current solutions| author =| publisher =| date =| url =http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/current-solutions/| accessdate =February 10, 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131204213904/http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/current-solutions/| archivedate =December 4, 2013| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The National Association of Relay Manufacturers, Engineers’ Relay Handbook, NARM, 8th Edition, 1980, Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reference Patent Application Publication # 20080266742 assigned to Watlow  Electric Manufacturing Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Arc Suppression | author=   | publisher =  | date = | url = http://www.electronic-components.com.au/products-services/arc-suppression/ | accessdate = December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Embilipitiya Power Station''' (also sometimes referred to as '''Ace Power Embilipitiya''') is a {{Nowrap|100 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} thermal [[power station]] in [[Embilipitiya]], [[Sri Lanka]]. The [[fuel oil|heavy fuel oil]]-run power station was commissioned in March 2005, and was operated by [[Aitken Spence]] (sometimes shortened to ''Ace''). The power station consisted of fourteen {{Nowrap|[[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] 16CM32C}} generation units of {{Nowrap|7.11 MW}} each, which consumed approximately {{Nowrap|550 [[tonne]]s}} of fuel oil per day. The [[Ministry of Power and Energy]] discontinued purchasing power from the private power station after its license expired in 2015, and hence was subsequently decommissioned.&lt;ref name=DailyNews2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jayakody|first1=Jayasri|title=Mulls plants in Bangladesh, Indonesia: Ace Power to venture overseas|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/08/15/bus01.asp|accessdate=7 November 2015|publisher=[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|Daily News]]|date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We decided to close down 03 thermal power generation plants that supplied electricity to the Ceylon Electricity Board|url=http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?page_id=3711|publisher=[[Ministry of Power and Energy]]|accessdate=7 November 2015|date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 [[Ceylon Electricity Board]] decided to recommission the plant due to high electricity demand in the country.&lt;ref name=DailyMirror2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pradeep|first1=Chaturanga|title=CEB to buy power from ACE|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/107674/CEB-to-buy-power-from-ACE|accessdate=26 February 2018|publisher=[[The Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)|Daily Mirror]]|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The facility cost approximately [[Sri Lankan Rupee|Rs.]] 8 billion to develop, and is built on a {{Convert|44|acre|ha|abbr=on|adj=on}} land on a 33-year lease.&lt;ref name=DailyNews2011 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diesel and Gas-Engine Power Plants in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.industcards.com/ic-sri-lanka.htm|publisher=Industcards.com|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3054">'''''Essentials of Post–[[Cold War]] [[Deterrence theory|Deterrence]]''''' is a document produced in 1995 as a "[[Terms of Reference]]" by the Policy Subcommittee of the Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) of the United States Strategic Command (current [[United States Strategic Command|USSTRATCOM]], former CINCSTRAT), a branch of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The document, drafted under former Commander-in-Chief of CINCSTRAT Admiral Chiles, is to be used as a baseline for future policies and strategies in "expanding the Deterrence of the Use of [[Weapons of mass destruction]]." Although originally classified, it has since been declassified and published by the [[Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability|Nautilus Institute]].

The Introduction of the document states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the period of the [[Cold War]], both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] developed an understanding of deterrence and its role in preventing war with one another. With the end of the Cold War and the spread of [[Weapons of mass destruction]], deterrence takes on a broader multinational dimension. This paper addresses the broader view of deterrence and the question, "How do we deter nations, other than the Former Soviet Union, from using Weapons of Mass Destruction?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article is notable not only for its significance in outlining current United States military strategy and foreign policy, but also for its explicit advocation of ambiguity regarding "what is permitted" for other nations and its endorsement of "irrationality", or more precisely, the perception thereof, as an important tool in deterrence and foreign policy.

The document claims that the capacity of the United States in exercising deterrence would be hurt by portraying U.S. leaders as fully rational and cool-headed, stating that: 

{{quote|The fact that some elements may appear to be potentially 'out of control' can be beneficial to creating and reinforcing fears and doubts in the minds of an adversary's decision makers. This essential sense of fear is the working force of deterrence. That the U.S. may become irrational and vindictive if its vital interests are attacked should be part of the national persona we project to all adversaries.}}

The '''eighth generation of the [[Ford F-Series]]''' is a line of pickup trucks and light- to medium-duty commercial trucks produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1986 to 1991. While the 1980 cab and chassis was carried over to the new model, the 1987 model was more streamlined, and maintenance items were made simpler. The exterior was facelifted with new composite headlamps, a more aerodynamic front end, and circular fenders. Inside, the interior was given a complete redesign.  Rear [[antilock brakes]] were now standard, the first pickup truck to boast this.  For the first time, all models were produced with straight-sided Styleside beds; the Flareside bed was discontinued except for a small number of early 1987 models using leftover 1986 beds with new circular fenders. In 1991 Ford premiered the 9th gen tail lights (the white reverse light was decreased in size) on the last year of the 8th generation.

==Trims==

*Custom
*XL
*XLT Lariat
*Nite (1991)

For 1991, a "Nite" trim package was introduced. It included all blacked-out exterior trim, either a pink or blue/purple stripe, and a "Nite" decal on the sides of the cargo box.

== Models ==
[[File:UHI DC5692.JPG|thumb|Ford F-350 [[U-Haul]] truck in [[Hampton, VA]].]]

* '''F-150''': 1/2 ton (6,250&amp;nbsp;lb [[GVWR]] max)
* '''F-250''': light-duty 3/4 ton (7,700&amp;nbsp;lb GVWR max)
* '''F-250HD''': 3/4 ton (8,800&amp;nbsp;lb GVWR max)
* '''F-350''': 1 ton (11,000&amp;nbsp;lb GVWR max)
* '''F-Super Duty''': Class 4 truck (15,000&amp;nbsp;lb GVWR max)

The new-for-1987 F-Super Duty was essentially a [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class 4 truck]] built as a chassis cab, with an aftermarket bed (specific to its future use) added after the truck was built. The F-Super Duty came with dual fuel tanks with a dash-mounted toggle switch to switch between each tank, while using only a single fuel gauge. It came with a [[Power take-off|PTO]] used to power attachments, such as winches or a dump bed, directly from the transmission. F-Super Duty models were rated at about {{convert|15000|lb|abbr=on}} [[GVWR]] and came with either the standard 7.5&amp;nbsp;L (460&amp;nbsp;CID) gas V8 or the optional 7.3&amp;nbsp;L (444&amp;nbsp;CID) diesel V8. All wheels were 10-lug with dual wheels in the rear. This model should not be confused with the later [[Ford Super Duty|Super Duty]] commercial line of trucks starting with the 1999 model year.

==Powertrain and chassis==
In a move to further update the F-Series engine lineup, the 4.9&amp;nbsp;L inline-6 was converted to fuel injection for 1987. A year later, Ford became the first pickup truck manufacturer to sell a fully non-carbureted engine lineup as the 5.8&amp;nbsp;L V8 and 7.5&amp;nbsp;L V8 also gained [[fuel injection]](the 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8 had gained fuel injection as an option for 1985 and was made standard in 1986). For 1988, the diesel V8 from International (Navistar) was enlarged to from 420 to 444 cubic inches (6.9 to 7.3 L); this allowed for an increase to {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|365|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.

While the dated 3-speed column-mounted manual transmission was discontinued, much of the rest of the transmission lineup carried over from the 1980-1986 trucks. In 1988, the five-speed ZF S5-42 replaced the Borg-Warner T19 in F-250 and F-350 models. For the F-150 and light-duty F-250, the heavier-duty Borg-Warner T18 4-speed manual remained available, while the Mazda-built [[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD]] 5-speed manual was added to the model lineup for 4.9&amp;nbsp;L inline-6 and 5.0&amp;nbsp;L V8-equipped models.

Four-wheel-drive improvements included the addition of automatic locking hubs for the F-150 in 1989. Models with the 5.0L V8 also had an option of a "Touch Drive" electronic transfer case.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

From 1980 through 1996, Ford offered a four-wheel-drive swing arm independent front suspension called [[Twin Traction Beam]] (TTB). Based on its two-wheel-drive twin I-beam suspension from 1965, Ford mounted a [[Dana 44]] differential in the driver-side (front) axle beam and transmitted torque to the passenger-side wheel with a double U-jointed axleshaft. Radius arms and coil springs were still used on the F-150, while the four-wheel-drive F-250 and F-350 got leaf springs. The F-250 received TTB [[Dana 50]] axles, and the F-350 a solid [[Dana 60]] axle.

'''Germanium dioxide''', also called '''germanium oxide''' and '''germania''', is an [[inorganic compound]] with the chemical formula [[Germanium|Ge]][[Oxide|O]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is the main commercial source of germanium. It also forms as a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]] on pure germanium in contact with atmospheric oxygen.

==Structure==
The two predominant polymorphs of GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are hexagonal and tetragonal. Hexagonal GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the same structure as β-quartz, with germanium having [[coordination number]] 4.  Tetragonal GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the mineral [[argutite]]) has the [[rutile]]-like structure seen in [[stishovite]].  In this motif, germanium has the coordination number 6.  An amorphous (glassy) form of GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is similar to [[fused silica]].&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germanium dioxide can be prepared in both [[crystalline]] and [[amorphous]] forms. At ambient pressure the amorphous structure is formed by a network of GeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra. At elevated pressure up to approximately 9 [[GPa]] the germanium average [[coordination number]] steadily increases from 4 to around 5 with a corresponding increase in the Ge-O bond distance.&lt;ref name=Drewitt2010&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=J W E Drewitt |author2=P S Salmon |author3=A C Barnes |author4=S Klotz |author5=H E Fischer |author6=W A Crichton |journal=Physical Review B|year=2010|volume=81|pages=014202|title=Structure of GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; glass at pressures up to 8.6 GPa|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.81.014202|bibcode = 2010PhRvB..81a4202D }}&lt;/ref&gt; At higher pressures, up to approximately 15 [[GPa]], the germanium [[coordination number]] increases to 6 and the dense network structure is composed of GeO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra.&lt;ref name=Guthrie&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Formation and Structure of a Dense Octahedral Glass|author1=M Guthrie |author2=C A Tulk |author3=C J Benmore |author4=J Xu |author5=J L Yarger |author6=D D Klug |author7=J S Tse |author8=H-k Mao |author9=R J Hemley |journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=93|issue=11|pages=115502|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.115502|pmid=15447351|year=2004|bibcode=2004PhRvL..93k5502G|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233949/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the pressure is subsequently reduced, the structure reverts to the tetrahedral form.&lt;ref name=Drewitt2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guthrie/&gt;  At high pressure, the rutile form converts to an orthorhombic CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; form.&lt;ref&gt;Structural evolution of rutile-type and CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-type germanium dioxide at high pressure, J. Haines, J. M.Léger, C.Chateau, A. S.Pereira, Physics and Chemistry of Minerals, 27, 8 ,(2000), 575–582,{{doi|10.1007/s002690000092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Heating germanium dioxide with powdered [[germanium]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C forms [[germanium monoxide]] (GeO).&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;

The hexagonal (d = 4.29 g/cm3) form of germanium dioxide is more soluble than the rutile (d = 6.27 g/cm3) form and dissolves to form {{not a typo|germanic}} acid, H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;GeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or Ge(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"&gt;Egon Wiberg, Arnold Frederick Holleman, (2001) ''Inorganic Chemistry'', Elsevier {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is only slightly soluble in acid but dissolves more readily in alkali to give [[germanate]]s.&lt;ref name = "Wiberg&amp;Holleman"/&gt;

In contact with [[hydrochloric acid]], it releases the volatile and corrosive [[germanium tetrachloride]].

==Uses==
The [[refractive index]] (1.7) and [[dispersion (optics)|optical dispersion]] properties of germanium dioxide makes it useful as an optical material for [[wide-angle lens]]es, in [[optical microscope]] [[Objective (optics)|objective]] [[lens (optics)|lenses]], and for the core of fiber-optic lines. See [[Optical fiber]] for specifics on the manufacturing process. Both Germanium and its glass oxide, GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are transparent to the [[infrared]] spectrum. The glass can be manufactured into IR windows and lenses, used for [[night vision device|night-vision]] technology in the military, luxury vehicles,&lt;ref&gt;"The Elements" C. R. Hammond, David R. Lide, ed. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, Edition 85 (CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL) (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thermographic camera]]s. GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is preferred over other IR transparent glasses because it is mechanically strong and therefore preferred for rugged military usage.&lt;ref&gt;"Germanium" Mineral Commodity Profile, U.S. Geological Survey, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mixture of silicon dioxide and germanium dioxide ("silica-germania") is used as an optical material for [[optical fiber]]s and [[optical waveguide]]s.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite web| url =http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/germanium/220400.pdf | title = Germanium| author =  Robert D. Brown, Jr.| publisher = U.S. Geological Survey | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controlling the ratio of the elements allows precise control of refractive index. Silica-germania glasses have lower viscosity and higher refractive index than pure silica. Germania replaced [[titanium dioxide|titania]] as the silica dopant for silica fiber, eliminating the need for subsequent heat treatment, which made the fibers brittle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sri.com/policy/csted/reports/sandt/techin2/chp3.html Chapter Iii: Optical Fiber For Communications&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615063643/http://www.sri.com/policy/csted/reports/sandt/techin2/chp3.html |date=2006-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germanium dioxide is also used as a [[catalyst]] in production of [[polyethylene terephthalate]] resin,&lt;ref name=Thiele&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thiele, Ulrich K. | year = 2001 | title = The Current Status of Catalysis and Catalyst Development for the Industrial Process of Poly(ethylene terephthalate) Polycondensation | journal = International Journal of Polymeric Materials | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–394 |doi = 10.1080/00914030108035115  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for production of other germanium compounds. It is used as a feedstock for production of some [[phosphor]]s and [[semiconductor material]]s.

Germanium dioxide is used in [[algaculture]] as an inhibitor of unwanted [[diatom]] growth in algal cultures, since contamination with the comparatively fast-growing diatoms often inhibits the growth of or outcompetes the original algae strains. GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is readily taken up by diatoms and leads to silicon being substituted by germanium in biochemical processes within the diatoms, causing a significant reduction of the diatoms' growth rate or even their complete elimination, with little effect on non-diatom algal species. For this application, the concentration of germanium dioxide typically used in the culture medium is between 1 and 10&amp;nbsp;mg/l, depending on the stage of the contamination and the species.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;{{cite book| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=9NADUHyFZaEC&amp;pg | title = Algal culturing techniques| author =  Robert Arthur Andersen| publisher = Elsevier Academic Press | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity and medical==
Germanium dioxide has low toxicity, but in higher doses it is [[Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]].

Germanium dioxide is used as a germanium supplement in some questionable [[dietary supplement]]s and "miracle cures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tao, S.H.  |author2=Bolger, P.M. |date=June 1997 | title = Hazard Assessment of Germanium Supplements | journal = [[Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology]] | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 211–219 | doi = 10.1006/rtph.1997.1098 | pmid = 9237323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  High doses of these resulted in several cases of germanium poisonings.

[[File:Golf-carts-2082955 1920.jpg|thumb|A row of golf carts lined up at a golf course.]]
A '''golf cart''' (called  '''golf car''' in [[ANSI]] standard Z130.1, since "carts" are not self-propelled)&lt;ref name="ANSI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/media_tips/golf.aspx?menuid=7|title=ANSI z130.1|author=|date=|website=ansi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a small [[vehicle]] designed originally to carry two [[golf]]ers and their [[Golf club (equipment)|golf clubs]] around a [[golf course]] or on desert trails with less effort than walking.

Golf carts come in a wide range of formats and are more generally used to convey small numbers of passengers short distances at speeds less than {{convert|15|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} per [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Standard z130.1 as originally manufactured. They are generally around {{convert|4|ft}} wide × {{convert|8|ft}} long × {{convert|6|ft}} high and weigh {{convert|900|lb}} to {{convert|1000|lb}}. Most are powered by 4-stroke engines.

The price of a golf cart can range anywhere from under US$1,000 to well over US$20,000 per cart, depending on several factors. These factors may include whether or not a fleet of carts is being purchased for a [[golf course]] or a [[country club]], for example, and whether the carts are new or used. Other factors may include options such as equipment requirements, and how many people the cart is meant to transport. With the rise in popularity of golf carts, many golf clubs or country clubs offer storage and energy options to golf cart owners. This has led to the modification of golf carts to suit use at a particular golf course. Typical modifications include windshields, ball cleaners, cooler trays, upgraded motor or speed controller (to increase speed and/or torque), and lift kits.

Originally golf carts were only [[electric motor|electrically]] powered, but in time [[gasoline]]-powered variants appeared. The electric variety is now used in many communities where their lack of [[pollutants]], lack of noise, and safety for pedestrians and other carts (due to slow speeds) are beneficial. When purpose-built for general [[transport]]ation these are called [[Neighborhood electric vehicle|Neighborhood Electric Vehicles]] (NEVs), but with various operating limitations such as top speed and heavy regulation on which type of streets these types of carts are permitted to be used. These may resemble the golf carts shown above, although some are now being made with all-weather car-like bodies.

The minimum age to drive a golf cart is 13 in Georgia, Alabama, California, Kansas, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Vermont, and South Carolina.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Other US states, such as Florida,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0300-0399/0316/Sections/0316.212.html|title=Statutes &amp; Constitution         :View Statutes       :        Online Sunshine|website=www.leg.state.fl.us|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a minimum age of 14–15 years.

==History==
Reportedly, the first use of a motorized cart on a golf course was by JK Wadley of Texarkana, Texas/Arkansas, who saw a three-wheeled electric cart being used in Los Angeles to transport senior citizens to the grocery store. Later, he purchased a cart and found that it worked poorly on a golf course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/historic-properties/_search_nomination_popup.asp?id=441 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004212947/http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/historic-properties/_search_nomination_popup.asp?id=441 |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first electric golf cart was custom-made in 1932, but did not gain widespread acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5uEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA801&amp;dq=popular+mechanics+1932+May,1932&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MRsPTeKDFofInAfj-8nLDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=popular%20mechanics%201932%20May%2C1932&amp;f=true Golfer Follows Ball In Car Run By Electricity", May 1932, Popular Mechanics] article bottom of page 801&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1930s until the 1950s the most widespread use of golf carts was for those with disabilities who could not walk far.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iuIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F1pgTsXYNInUgQfhoo2PAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Electric Auto as Caddy Serves Crippled Player" ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1930, bottom of pg. 199]&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 1950s the golf cart had gained wide acceptance with golfers, with several manufactures (e.g. [[Victor Adding Machine Co.]] and [[Sears Roebuck]]) producing various models. Most were electric.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qsgcX3mC0k&amp;sig=5uzq7dFzwBL4NlAn6jl810wzujk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DPAdUMLcFabRyAGC94D4CQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Mechanics%20Science%20installing%20linoleum&amp;f=true "Golfers Mobilize"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1956, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PDS trucks.jpg|right|thumb|Italian [[Polizia di Stato|State Police]] golf carts at [[Venice|Venice Railway Station]].]]
Merle Williams of [[Long Beach, California]] was an early innovator of the electric golf cart.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} He started with knowledge gained from production of electric cars due to World War II gasoline rationing. In 1951 his Marketeer Company began production of an electric golf cart in [[Redlands, California]]. [[E-Z-Go]] began producing golf cars in 1954, [[Cushman (company)|Cushman]] in 1955, [[Club Car]] in 1958, Taylor-Dunn in 1961, [[Harley-Davidson]] in 1963, [https://mygolfcartreview.com/ Yamaha Golf Car] in 1979 and [[CT&amp;T United|CT&amp;T]] in 2002.

Max Walker created the first gasoline-powered golf cart "The Walker Executive" in 1957.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} This three-wheeled vehicle was shaped with a [[Vespa]]-style front end and, like any golf cart, carried two passengers and golf bags.

In 1963 the [[Harley-Davidson]] Motor Company began producing golf carts. Over the years they manufactured and distributed thousands of three- and four-wheeled gasoline-powered and electric vehicles that are still highly sought after. The iconic three-wheeled cart, with either a steering wheel or a tiller-based steering control, boasted a reversible two-stroke engine similar to one used today in some high-end snowmobiles. (The engine runs clockwise in forward mode.) In 1982 Harley Davidson sold the production of golf carts to the Columbia Car Company. Many of these gems survive today, and are the prized possessions of proud owners, restorers, and collectors worldwide.

===Other types of golf carts===

====Adaptive golf carts====
New technology such as the SoloRider, an adaptive golf cart designed for a single user, is allowing disabled persons access to the golf course and the game itself. The cart’s seat swivels around, extends to an upright position, and allows the golfer to stand upright, be supported, and swing using both hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solorider.com/|title=Home - SoloRider: The Leading Single Rider Adaptive Golf Cart for People with Disablities|author=|date=|website=www.solorider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/golf-access.html|title=''Ability Magazine: Golf Access"'' (2011)|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Extreme off road golf cart.jpg|thumb|left|Extreme off-road golf cart]]

====Extreme golf carts====
Golf carts are now taking on an extreme nature, being highly modified from their original configuration to perform similar to the growing popularity of the [[Side by Side (UTV)]]. Modifications as minor as suspension upgrades are commonplace, while entire redesigns may include axles and an engine from a full size [[automobile]].
Solar-powered golf carts are an alternative to gas or regular charged electric golf cart. While this technology is still new and not as efficient as gas or electric, it is becoming more and more popular.  In 2014, citEcar built and tested a solar-powered street-legal golf cart that will travel 105 miles on a single charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citecarelectricvehicles.com/product.aspx?ProductId=180&amp;title=citEcar+6PR+XLC+Street+Legal+Golf+Cart|title=Page not found|author=|date=|website=citecarelectricvehicles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most recent developments in golf cart technology is the GolfBoard, a golf cart that is inspired by the skateboard. The GolfBoard is driven by front and back gear boxes providing power to all four wheels. The golfer controls the cart in a standing upright position as if riding skateboard, leaning left or right to make turns. The GolfBoard has been well received by the golfing community, as it speeds up play and, according to the manufacturers, has up to 75% less impact on turf than traditional golf carts. In 2014 the GolfBoard was voted the Best New Product at the PGA Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strege|first1=John|title=GolfBoard: Where skateboard meets golf cart|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/story/golfboard-where-skateboard-mee|website=Golf Digest|publisher=Golf Digest|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Golf cart communities==
[[Peachtree City, Georgia]] has many miles of golf cart paths that link the city together. Golf cart travel is used by a great majority of the community, especially among high school students. [[McIntosh High School]] even has a student golf cart parking lot on campus.

On islands (such as [[Santa Catalina Island, California]], [[Bald Head Island, North Carolina|Bald Head Island]], [[North Captiva Island]], North Carolina, and [[Hamilton Island (Queensland)|Hamilton Island]]), motor vehicles are sometimes restricted and residents use golf carts instead.

[[The Villages, Florida]], a retirement community of over 70,000 people, has an extensive golf cart trail system (estimated at around {{convert|100|mi}}) and also allows golf carts on many streets. It is the most popular form of transportation in this community.

On the tropical islands of [[Belize]] golf carts are a major form of road transport and can be rented by tourists.

The residential community of [[Discovery Bay]], Hong Kong does not allow the use of private vehicles apart from a fleet of 520 golf carts ''(excluding the ones operating exclusively in the Golf or the Marina Clubs)''. The remainder of the 20,000 residents rely on a mixture of shuttle buses and hire cars to travel around the township.

The [[Palm Springs]] Area in California contains multiple golf cart communities including PGA West, The Madison Club, The Hideaway, and many other golf course/golf cart communities. The [[PGA Tour]] is held at PGA West every January.

==Accidents and injuries==
Along with the rising frequency of golf cart crashes, the number of golf-cart-related injuries has increased significantly over the last decade. A study conducted by researchers in the Center for Injury Research and Policy of [[Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus)#Research|The Research Institute at the Nationwide Children's Hospital]] found that the number of golf cart-related injuries rose 132% during the 17-year study period. According to the study, published in the July 2008 issue of the [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]], there were an estimated 148,000 golf cart-related injuries between 1990 and 2006, ranging from an estimated 5,770 cases in 1990 to approximately 13,411 cases in 2006. More than 30% of golf cart-related injuries involved children under the age of 16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541635/ Newswise: First National Study to Examine Golf Cart-Related Injuries] Retrieved on June 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common type of injury was [[soft tissue]] damage, usually just [[bruise]]s, followed by [[fractures]], constituting 22.3% of the cases, and [[lacerations]], accounting for 15.5% of injuries.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;Watson, Daniel S. et al. ''Golf Cart-Related Injuries in the U.S.'' [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]], issue 35 (2008): pp. 55–9&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of injuries include concussions, internal injuries, [[hematoma|subdural hematoma]], [[spinal cord injury]], or acute respiratory compromise. While rare, a few cases had severe outcomes: 4 fatalities, 2 [[paraplegic]], and 1 [[quadriplegic]] injuries have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Edward, G. ''Major Injuries Occurring During Use of a Golf Cart.'' South Hills Orthopaedic Surgery Associates, Pittsburgh (1996). pp. 519–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the main causes of injury related to golf cart accidents included cart overturn, falling/jumping from a moving golf cart, collision with another vehicle or stationary object, struck/run over by a cart, getting into or out of a moving cart. Out of all these, "falling or jumping from a golf cart" was the most common cause of injury for both adults and children.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;

One contributing reason is that current golf cart safety features are insufficient to prevent passenger falls or ejection.&lt;ref&gt;Seluga, Kristopher J., et al. ''Low Speed Passenger Ejection Restraint Effectiveness.'' Accident and Analysis Prevention, Stamford (2005). pp. 801–6&lt;/ref&gt; Golf carts moving at speeds as low as {{convert|11|mph}} could readily eject a passenger during a turn. Furthermore, rear-facing golf cart seats are associated with high rates of passenger ejection during fast acceleration, and most standard (stock) golf carts do not have brakes on all four wheels (typically brakes are only on the rear wheels, thus sharply limiting their braking power).&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seluga, Kristopher J., et al. ''Braking Hazards of Golf Cars and Low Speed Vehicles.'' Accident Analysis and Prevention, Stamford (2006). pp. 1151–1156&lt;/ref&gt;

Golf cart injuries are also commonly found in desert areas (e.g. [[Johnson Valley, California]]). Driving golf carts on bumpy dirt trails, along cliffs, down rocky trails that should only be traversed using 4-wheel-drive vehicles, can all lead to injuries.

== Golf cart safety ==
In 2014, [[Arizona]] Governor [[Jan Brewer]] signed a law permitting golf cart drivers to drive as close to the right-hand edge of the roadway as possible.  Prior to the passage of the law, golf cart drivers received traffic tickets for failing to drive in the center of the roadway. Complementing the new law, a golf cart safety education program was initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/surprise/2014/08/14/golf-carts-rule-roads-sun-city/14095291/|title=Sun City residents celebrate new golf-cart law|work=azcentral|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the [[Logarithmic timeline|logarithmic scale]] is used for such timelines but it compresses the most interesting Stelliferous Era too much as [[Future of an expanding universe#Graphical timeline|this]] example shows. Therefore, a [[Logarithm#Related operations and generalizations|double-logarithmic]] scale ''s'' (''s*100'' in the graphics) is used instead. The minimum of it is only 1, not 0 as needed, and the negative outputs for inputs smaller than 10 are useless. Therefore, the time from 0.1 to 10 years is collapsed to a single point 0, but that does not matter in this case because nothing special happens in the history of the universe during that time.

: &lt;math&gt; s =
 \begin{cases}
 \log_{10} \log_{10} year &amp; \mbox{if } year &gt; 10 \mbox{ , corresponding to } year = 10^{10^{s}} \\
 0 &amp; \mbox{if } 0.1 \le year \le 10 \\
 -\log_{10} (-\log_{10} year) &amp; \mbox{if } year &lt; 0.1 \mbox{ , corresponding to } year = 10^{-10^{-s}}
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Aircraft wing lift distribution showing trailing vortices (2).svg|thumb|Any change in lift distribution sheds a new trailing vortex, according to the [[lifting-line theory]]]]
[[File:Aircraft wing lift distribution showing trailing vortices (3).svg|thumb|A realistic lift distribution causes the shedding of a complex vorticity pattern behind the aircraft.]]

The '''horseshoe vortex''' model is a simplified representation of the [[vortex]] system of a [[wing]]. In this model the wing [[vorticity]] is modelled by a bound vortex of constant [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]], travelling with the wing, and two trailing [[wingtip vortices]], therefore having a shape vaguely reminiscent of a [[horseshoe]].&lt;ref&gt;Millikan, Clark B., ''Aerodynamics of the Airplane'', Figure 1.35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W., ''Aerodynamics, Aeronautics, and Flight Mechanics'', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; A [[starting vortex]] is shed as the wing begins to move through the fluid, which dissipates under the action of [[viscosity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NASA Glenn Research Center|title=Shed Vortex|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/shed.html|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do the trailing vortices far behind the aircraft.

The trailing [[wingtip]] vortices are responsible for the component of the [[downwash]] which creates [[induced drag]].&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W., ''Aerodynamics, Aeronautics, and Flight Mechanics'', Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The horseshoe vortex model is unrealistic in that it implies uniform [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] (and hence, according to the [[Kutta–Joukowski theorem]], uniform lift) at all sections on the [[wingspan]]. In a more realistic model, the [[lifting-line theory]], the vortex strength varies along the wingspan, and the loss in vortex strength is shed as a vortex ''sheet'' all along the trailing edge, rather than as a single trail at the wing-tips.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W., ''Aerodynamics, Aeronautics, and Flight Mechanics'', Figure 4.21&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the simpler horseshoe vortex model used with a reduced effective wingspan but same mid-plane circulation provides an adequate model for the flows induced far from the aircraft.

The term '''horseshoe vortex''' is also used in [[Wind Engineering|wind engineering]] to describe the flow pattern created by strong winds around the base of a tall building.  This effect is amplified by the presence of a low-rise building just upwind. This effect was studied at the UK Building Research Establishment between 1963 and 1973&lt;ref&gt;Penwarden, AD. Wise, AFE. Wind environment around buildings, cover illustration&lt;/ref&gt; and the cause of the effect is described in contemporary wind engineering text books.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, NJ. The designer's guide to wind loading of building structures, Part 1, Figure 8.7&lt;/ref&gt;

In hydrodynamics, a form of horseshoe vortex forms around bluff bodies in the flowing water, for instance around bridge piers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dargahi|first=Bijan|date=1989|title=The turbulent flow field around a circular cylinder|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00203058|journal=Experiments in Fluids|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can cause scouring of bed materials from both upstream and downstream of the pier.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

In nature, a horseshoe vortex can cause a [[horseshoe cloud]] to form.&lt;ref name="IIE"&gt;{{cite web |title=An incredibly rare 'horseshoe cloud' was spotted in Nevada and it kept the meme-makers busy |url=https://www.independent.ie/world-news/and-finally/an-incredibly-rare-horseshoe-cloud-was-spotted-in-nevada-and-it-kept-the-mememakers-busy-36691086.html |website=Independent.ie |date=12 March 2018 |accessdate=12 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The '''long''' or '''imperial hundredweight''' of 8&amp;nbsp;[[stone (unit)|stone]] (112&amp;nbsp;lb or 50.802345&amp;nbsp;kg) is in informal use in the [[Imperial units|imperial system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=UK Units of Measurement Regulations 1995 |path=uksi/1995/1804/contents/made|asmade=yes}}, which reiterates for hundredweight the {{UK-LEG|title=Weights and Measures Act 1985|path=ukpga/1985/72/contents}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but its use for trade in the UK was ended by Schedule 1, Part VI of the [[Weights and Measures Act 1985]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/72/pdfs/ukpga_19850072_en.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under both conventions, there are 20 hundredweight in a [[ton]], producing a "[[short ton]]" of 2000&amp;nbsp;lb and a "[[long ton]]" of 2240&amp;nbsp;lb.

==History==
The hundredweight has had many different values. In England in around 1300, various different "hundreds" (''centem'' in [[Medieval Latin]]) [[Assize of Weights and Measures|were defined]]. The [[Weights and Measures Act of 1835]] formally established the present imperial hundredweight of 112&amp;nbsp;lb. The use in trade of measures by "cental", "hundredweight", or "quintal"  have now been banned in the United Kingdom under the [[Weights and Measures Act of 1985 (UK)|Weights and Measures Act of 1985]].

The United States and Canada came to use the term "hundredweight" to refer to a unit of 100&amp;nbsp;lb. This measure was specifically banned from British use—upon risk of being sued for [[fraud]]—by the [[Weights and Measures Act of 1824]] but, in 1879, the measure was legalized under the name "cental" in response to legislative pressure from British merchants importing [[wheat]] and [[tobacco]] from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter VII of the book ''Men and measures: a history of weights and measures, ancient and modern'', by Edward Nicholson (published 1912).

A few decades ago, commodities weighed in terms of long hundredweight included cattle, cattle fodder, fertilizers, coal, some industrial chemicals, other industrial materials, and so on. However, since increasing metrication in most English-speaking countries, it is now less used. Church bell ringers use the unit commonly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Older blacksmiths' [[anvil]]s are often stamped with a three-digit number indicating their total weight in hundredweight, quarter-hundredweight (28 lb), and pounds. Thus, an anvil stamped "1.1.8" will weigh 148 lb (112 lb + 28 lb + 8 lb).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''hybrid sulfur cycle''' (HyS) is a two-step [[water splitting|water-splitting]] process intended to be used for [[hydrogen production]].  Based on [[sulfur]] [[oxidation and reduction]], it is classified as a hybrid [[thermochemical cycle]] because it uses an [[electrochemical]] (instead of a thermochemical) reaction for one of the two steps. The remaining thermochemical step is shared with the [[sulfur-iodine cycle]].

The HyS cycle was initially proposed and developed by Westinghouse Electric Corp. in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;Lee E. Brecher and Christopher K. Wu, “Electrolytic decomposition of water”, Westinghouse Electric Corp., Patent 3,888,750, June 10, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; so it is also known as the "Westinghouse" cycle. Current development efforts in the United States are being led by the [[Savannah River National Laboratory]].

== Process Description ==

The two reactions in the HyS cycle are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Maximilian B. Gorensek &amp; William A. Summers |title=Hybrid Sulfur flowsheets using PEM electrolysis and a bayonet decomposition reactor |journal=Int. J.

# SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(aq)'' + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)'' → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)''          (electrochemical, T = 80-120&amp;nbsp;°C)

:
: '''Net reaction:''' H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)'' → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + ½ O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)''

Sulfur dioxide acts to depolarize the [[anode]] of the [[electrolyzer]]. This results in a significant decrease in the [[reversible potential|reversible cell potential]] (and, therefore, the electric power requirement) for reaction (2). The [[standard cell potential]] for reaction (2) is -0.158 V at 298.15 K, compared to -1.229 V for the electrolysis of water (with oxygen evolution as the anodic reaction).&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Maximilian B.

'''ITER''' (''International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor'') is an international [[nuclear fusion]] research and engineering [[megaproject]], which will be the world's largest magnetic confinement [[plasma physics]] experiment. It is an experimental [[tokamak]] [[fusion reactor|nuclear fusion reactor]] that is being built next to the [[Cadarache]] facility in [[Saint-Paul-lès-Durance]], in [[Provence]], southern France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060824071609/http://www.efda.org/the_iter_project/index.htm The ITER project]. EFDA, European Fusion Development Agreement (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

ITER was proposed in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/21/068/21068957.pdf |title=NCL Collection Store |date= |website=www.iaea.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designed as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, according to the "ITER Technical Basis," published by the International Atomic Energy Agency, in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/books/IAEABooks/6492/ITER-Technical-Basis|title=ITER Technical Basis|first=|last=IAEA|date=12 September 2018|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005, the ITER organization abandoned the original meaning of the acronym ''iter'', and instead adopted a new meaning, the Latin word for "the way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iter.org:80/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205034858/http://www.iter.org:80/index.htm|archivedate=2005-02-05|title=Wayback Machine|date=5 February 2005|others=Under "What is ITER?"|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ITER [[thermonuclear fusion]] reactor has been designed to produce a fusion plasma equivalent to 500 megawatts (MW) of thermal output power for around twenty minutes while 50 megawatts of thermal power are injected into the tokamak, resulting in a [[Fusion power#Q|ten-fold gain of plasma heating power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts &amp; Figures|url=https://www.iter.org/factsfigures|website=ITER|accessdate=25 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thereby the machine aims to demonstrate the principle of producing more thermal power from the fusion process than is used to heat the plasma, something that has not yet been achieved in any fusion reactor. 
The total electricity consumed by the reactor and facilities will range from 110 MW up to 620 MW peak for 30-second periods during plasma operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Supply|url=https://www.iter.org/mach/powersupply|website=ITER|accessdate=25 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thermal-to-electric conversion is not included in the design because ITER will not produce sufficient power for net electrical production. The emitted heat from the fusion reaction will be vented to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="jt60sa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jt60sa.org/b/FAQ/EE2.htm|title=Will ITER make more energy than it consumes?|website=www.jt60sa.org|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/media/workshops/2016/fpccwebinar/Item_6_EUROPE.pdf |title=Workshop |date=2016 |website=www.iaea.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The project is funded and run by seven member entities—the [[European Union]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]]. The EU, as host party for the ITER complex, is contributing about 45 percent of the cost, with the other six parties contributing approximately 9 percent each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |date=14 October 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11541383 |title=Key component contract for Iter fusion reactor |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fusionforenergy.europa.eu/understandingfusion/ourcontribution.aspx ITER – Our Contribution].

==Background==
[[Image:Deuterium-tritium fusion.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|ITER will produce energy by fusing deuterium and tritium to helium.]]
Fusion power has the potential to provide sufficient energy to satisfy mounting demand, and to do so sustainably, with a relatively small impact on the environment.

Nuclear fusion has many potential attractions. Firstly, its [[hydrogen isotope]] fuels are relatively abundant – one of the necessary isotopes, [[deuterium]], can be extracted from [[seawater]], while the other fuel, [[tritium]], would be bred from a lithium blanket using neutrons produced in the fusion reaction itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iter.org/sci/fusionfuels "Fusion fuels"]. ITER. Retrieved 24 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a fusion reactor would produce virtually no [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] or atmospheric pollutants, and its [[nuclear waste|radioactive waste products]] would mostly be very short-lived compared to those produced by conventional nuclear reactors.

On 21 November 2006, the seven [[ITER#Participants|participants]] formally agreed to fund the creation of a nuclear fusion reactor.&lt;ref name=ns20061121&gt;{{cite web |title= Green light for nuclear fusion project |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10633-green-light-for-nuclear-fusion-project.html |date=21 November 2006 |website=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is anticipated to last for 30 years – 10 for construction, and 20 of operation. ITER was originally expected to cost approximately €5 billion, but the rising price of raw materials and changes to the initial design have seen that amount almost triple to €13 billion.&lt;ref name="ITER Organisation 2015"/&gt; The reactor is expected to take 10 years to build with completion scheduled for 2019.&lt;ref name=doub&gt;McGrath, Matt. (29 July 2010) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10793883 Deal finalised on fusion reactor]. BBC. Retrieved 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Site preparation has begun in [[Cadarache]], France, and procurement of large components has started.&lt;ref name=iter&gt;[http://www.iter.org/ ITER website]. Iter.org. Retrieved 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

When supplied with 300 MW of electrical power, ITER is expected to produce the equivalent of 500 [[Megawatt|MW]] of thermal power sustained for up to 1,000 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100310021211/http://www.iter.org/mach/Pages/Tokamak.aspx ITER – The World's Largest Tokamak]. iter.org&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to [[Joint European Torus|JET]]'s consumption of 700 MW of electrical power and peak thermal output of 16 MW for less than a second) by the fusion of about 0.5 g of [[deuterium]]/[[tritium]] mixture in its approximately 840 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; reactor chamber. The heat produced in ITER will not be used to generate any electricity because after accounting for losses and the 300 MW minimum power input, the 
output will be equivalent to a zero (net) power reactor.&lt;ref name="jt60sa.org"/&gt;

Preparations for the first [[Geneva Summit (1985)|Gorbachev-Reagan Summit]] showed that there were no tangible agreements in the works for the summit.

One energy research project, however, was being considered quietly by two physicists, [[Alvin Trivelpiece]] and [[Evgeny Velikhov]]. The project involved collaboration on the next phase of magnetic fusion research — the construction of a demonstration model. At the time, magnetic fusion research was ongoing in Japan, Europe, the Soviet Union and the US. Velikhov and Trivelpiece believed that taking the next step in fusion research would be beyond the budget of any of the key nations and that collaboration would be useful internationally.

A major bureaucratic fight erupted in the US government over the project. One argument against collaboration was that the Soviets would use it to steal US technology and know-how. A second was symbolic — the Soviet physicist [[Andrei Sakharov]] was in internal exile and the US was pushing the Soviet Union on its human rights record. The [[United States National Security Council]] convened a meeting under the direction of [[William Flynn Martin]] that resulted in a consensus that the US should go forward with the project.

Martin and Velikhov concluded the agreement that was agreed at the summit and announced in the last paragraph of this historic summit meeting, "... The two leaders emphasized the potential importance of the work aimed at utilizing controlled thermonuclear fusion for peaceful purposes and, in this connection, advocated the widest practicable development of international cooperation in obtaining this source of energy, which is essentially inexhaustible, for the benefit for all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1985/112185a.htm Joint Soviet-United States Statement on the Summit Meeting in Geneva] Ronald Reagan. November 21, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptual and engineering design phases carried out under the auspices of the [[IAEA]] led to an acceptable, detailed design in 2001, underpinned by US$650 million worth of research and development by the "ITER Parties" to establish its practical feasibility.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} These parties, namely [[European Union|EU]], Japan, [[Russian Federation]] (replacing the Soviet Union), and United States (which opted out of the project in 1999 and returned in 2003), were joined in negotiations by China, [[South Korea]], and Canada (who then terminated its participation at the end of 2003). India officially became part of ITER in December 2005.

On 28 June 2005, it was officially announced that ITER would be built in the [[European Union]] in Southern France. The negotiations that led to the decision ended in a compromise between the EU and Japan, in that Japan was promised 20% of the research staff on the French location of ITER, as well as the head of the administrative body of ITER. In addition, another research facility for the project will be built in Japan, and the European Union has agreed to contribute about 50% of the costs of this institution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050823033756/http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200506280351.html Japan cedes ITER project to France]. The Asahi Shimbun, 29 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2006, an international consortium signed a formal agreement to build the reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6165932.stm |title=States sign nuclear energy pact |publisher=BBC News | date=21 November 2006 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 2007, the People's Republic of China became the seventh party to deposit the ITER Agreement to the [[IAEA]]. Finally, on 24 October 2007, the ITER Agreement entered into force and the ITER Organization legally came into existence.

==Objectives==

ITER's mission is to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion power, and prove that it can work without negative impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why ITER? |url=http://www.iter.org/proj/Pages/ITERMission.aspx |website=The ITER Organization|accessdate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the project aims to:
* Momentarily produce a fusion plasma with thermal power ten times greater than the injected thermal power (a [[Fusion energy gain factor|''Q'' value]] of 10).
* Produce a steady-state plasma with a [[Fusion energy gain factor|''Q'' value]] greater than 5. (''Q'' = 1 is scientific breakeven.)
* Maintain a fusion pulse for up to 8 minutes.
* Develop technologies and processes needed for a fusion power station — including [[superconducting magnet]]s and [[remote handling]] (maintenance by robot).
* Verify [[tritium]] breeding concepts.
* Refine neutron shield/heat conversion technology (most of the energy in the D+T fusion reaction is released in the form of fast neutrons).

In 1978, the [[European Commission]], [[Japan]], [[United States]], and [[USSR]] joined in the International Tokamak Reactor (INTOR) Workshop, under the auspices of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), to assess the readiness of magnetic fusion to move forward to the experimental power reactor (EPR) stage, to identify the additional [[R&amp;D]] that must be undertaken, and to define the characteristics of such an EPR by means of a conceptual design. Hundreds of fusion scientists and engineers in each participating country took part in a detailed assessment of the then present status of the [[tokamak]] confinement concept vis-a-vis the requirements of an EPR, identified the required R&amp;D by early 1980, and produced a conceptual design by mid-1981.

In 1985, at the [[Geneva Summit (1985)|Geneva summit meeting in 1985]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] suggested to [[Ronald Reagan]] that the two countries jointly undertake the construction of a tokamak EPR as proposed by the INTOR Workshop. The ITER project was initiated in 1988.&lt;ref name="Fusion Energy Reactor 2010"&gt;''"Quest for a Fusion Energy Reactor: An Insider's Account of the INTOR Workshop"'', Oxford University Press (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Milestones2012&gt;{{cite web |title= The Geneva Summit |url=http://www.iter.org/proj/itermilestones |website=Milestones in the History of the ITER Project |publisher=ITER |date=November 1985 |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactor overview==
{{See also|Nuclear fusion}}

When [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] fuse, two [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] come together to form a [[helium]] nucleus (an [[alpha particle]]), and a high-energy [[neutron]].
:{{nuclide|Deuterium}} + {{nuclide|Tritium}} → {{nuclide|Helium}} + {{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + {{val|17.59|ul=MeV}}
While nearly all stable [[isotopes]] lighter on the [[periodic table]] than [[iron-56]] and [[nickel-62]], which have the highest [[nuclear binding energy|binding energy per nucleon]], will fuse with some other isotope and release energy, deuterium and tritium are by far the most attractive for energy generation as they require the lowest activation energy (thus lowest temperature) to do so, while producing among the most energy per unit weight.

All proto- and mid-life stars radiate enormous amounts of energy generated by fusion processes. Mass for mass, the deuterium–tritium fusion process releases roughly three times as much energy as uranium-235 fission, and millions of times more energy than a chemical reaction such as the burning of coal. It is the goal of a fusion power station to harness this energy to produce electricity.

Activation energies for fusion reactions are generally high because the [[proton]]s in each nucleus will tend to strongly repel one another, as they each have the same positive [[Elementary charge|charge]]. A [[heuristic]] for estimating reaction rates is that nuclei must be able to get within 100 [[femtometers]] (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; meter) of each other, where the nuclei are increasingly likely to undergo [[quantum tunneling]] past the [[electrostatic]] barrier and the turning point where the [[Nuclear force|strong nuclear force]] and the electrostatic force are equally balanced, allowing them to fuse. In ITER, this distance of approach is made possible by high temperatures and magnetic confinement.
High [[temperatures]] give the nuclei enough energy to overcome their [[electrostatic repulsion]] (see [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]). For deuterium and tritium, the optimal reaction rates occur at temperatures on the order of 100,000,000 [[kelvin|K]]. The plasma is heated to a high temperature by [[ohmic heating]] (running a current through the plasma). Additional heating is applied using [[Neutral Beam Injection|neutral beam injection]] (which cross magnetic field lines without a net deflection and will not cause a large electromagnetic disruption) and [[radio frequency]] (RF) or [[microwave]] heating.

At such high temperatures, particles have a large [[kinetic energy]], and hence velocity. If unconfined, the particles will rapidly escape, taking the energy with them, cooling the plasma to the point where net energy is no longer produced. A successful reactor would need to contain the particles in a small enough volume for a long enough time for much of the plasma to fuse.
In ITER and many other [[magnetic confinement]] reactors, the plasma, a gas of charged particles, is confined using magnetic fields. A charged particle moving through a [[magnetic field]] experiences a force perpendicular to the direction of travel, resulting in [[centripetal acceleration]], thereby confining it to move in a circle or helix around the lines of magnetic flux.

A solid confinement vessel is also needed, both to shield the magnets and other equipment from high temperatures and energetic photons and particles, and to maintain a near-vacuum for the plasma to populate.
The containment vessel is subjected to a barrage of very energetic particles, where electrons, ions, photons, alpha particles, and neutrons constantly bombard it and degrade the structure. The material must be designed to endure this environment so that a power station would be economical. Tests of such materials will be carried out both at ITER and at [[IFMIF]] (International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility).

Once fusion has begun, high [[energy]] neutrons will radiate from the reactive regions of the plasma, crossing magnetic field lines easily due to charge neutrality (see [[neutron flux]]). Since it is the neutrons that receive the majority of the energy, they will be ITER's primary source of energy output. Ideally, alpha particles will expend their energy in the plasma, further heating it.

Beyond the inner wall of the containment vessel one of several test blanket modules will be placed. These are designed to slow and absorb neutrons in a reliable and efficient manner, limiting damage to the rest of the structure, and breeding tritium for fuel from lithium-bearing ceramic pebbles contained within the blanket module following the following reactions:

:{{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + {{nuclide|Lithium|6}} → {{nuclide|Tritium}} + {{nuclide|Helium}}
:{{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + {{nuclide|Lithium|7}} → {{nuclide|Tritium}} + {{nuclide|Helium}} + {{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}}

where the reactant neutron is supplied by the D-T fusion reaction.

Energy absorbed from the fast neutrons is extracted and passed into the primary coolant. This heat energy would then be used to power an electricity-generating turbine in a real power station; in ITER this generating system is not of scientific interest, so instead the heat will be extracted and disposed of.

==Technical design==
{{wide image|ITER Tokamak and Plant Systems (2016) (41783636452).jpg|1200px|alt=Drawing of the ITER tokamak and integrated plant systems|Drawing of the ITER tokamak and integrated plant systems}}

===Vacuum vessel===
[[Image:NIST Light Source Illuminates Fusion Power Diagnostics (5940503177).jpg|thumb|Cross-section of part of the planned ITER fusion reaction vessel.]]
The vacuum vessel is the central part of the ITER machine: a double walled steel container in which the plasma is contained by means of magnetic fields.

The ITER vacuum vessel will be twice as large and 16 times as heavy as any previously manufactured fusion vessel: each of the nine [[torus|torus shaped]] sectors will weigh between 390 and 430 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fusionforenergy.europa.eu/documents/iter_calls/26.pdf ITER Vacuum Vessel Assembly – Call for Expression of Interest]. ITER. 20 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When all the shielding and port structures are included, this adds up to a total of 5,116 tonnes. Its external diameter will measure {{convert|19.4|m}}, the internal {{convert|6.5|m}}. Once assembled, the whole structure will be {{convert|11.3|m}} high.

The primary function of the vacuum vessel is to provide a hermetically sealed plasma container. Its main components are the main vessel, the port structures and the supporting system. The main vessel is a double walled structure with poloidal and toroidal stiffening ribs between {{convert|60|mm|in|adj=mid|-thick}} shells to reinforce the vessel structure. These ribs also form the flow passages for the cooling water. The space between the double walls will be filled with shield structures made of stainless steel. The inner surfaces of the vessel will act as the interface with breeder modules containing the breeder blanket component. These modules will provide shielding from the high-energy neutrons produced by the fusion reactions and some will also be used for tritium breeding concepts.

The vacuum vessel has 18 upper, 17 equatorial and 9 lower ports that will be used for remote handling operations, diagnostic systems, neutral beam injections and vacuum pumping.

===Breeder blanket===
Owing to very limited terrestrial resources of [[tritium]], a key component of the ITER reactor design is the breeder blanket. This component, located adjacent to the vacuum vessel, serves to produce tritium through reaction with neutrons from the plasma. There are several reactions that produce tritium within the blanket. {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Lithium|6}} produces tritium via n,t reactions with moderated neutrons, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Lithium|7}} produces tritium via interactions with higher energy neutrons via n,nt reactions. Concepts for the breeder blanket include helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) and helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB) methods. Six different Test Blanket Modules (TBM) will be tested in ITER and will share a common box geometry. Materials for use as breeder pebbles in the HCPB concept include [[Lithium titanate|lithium metatitanate]] and lithium orthosilicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hanaor| first1=D.A.H.| last2=Kolb| first2=M.H.H.| last3=Gan| first3=Y.| last4=Kamlah| first4=M.| last5=Knitter| first5=R.| title= Solution based synthesis of mixed-phase materials in the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; system | journal= Journal of Nuclear Materials|year=2014| volume=456| pages=151–161| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022311514006187| doi=10.1016/j.jnucmat.2014.09.028|arxiv = 1410.7128 |bibcode = 2015JNuM..456..151H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Requirements of breeder materials include good tritium production and extraction, mechanical stability and low activation levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Gan| first1=Y| last2=Hernandez|first2=F|display-authors=etal |title=Thermal Discrete Element Analysis of EU Solid Breeder Blanket Subjected to Neutron Irradiation| journal= Fusion Science and Technology|year=2014| volume=66|issue=1| pages=83–90 | arxiv=1406.4199| doi=10.13182/FST13-727| citeseerx=10.1.1.748.6005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnet system===
The central [[solenoid]] coil will use [[superconducting]] [[niobium-tin]] to carry 46 [[Ampere|kA]] and produce a field of up to 13.5 [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]].
The 18 [[Toroid (geometry)|toroidal]] field coils will also use niobium-tin. At their maximum field strength of 11.8 teslas, they will be able to store 41 [[gigajoule]]s. They have been tested at a record 80 kA. Other lower field ITER magnets (PF and CC) will use [[niobium-titanium]] for their superconducting elements. As of now the in-wall shielding blocks to protect the magnets from high energy neutrons are being manufactured and transported from the Avasarala technologies in Bangalore India to the ITER center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iter.org/whatsnew/print/2016/03/21 |title=What's news |date=2016 |website=www.iter.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional heating===
There will be three types of external heating in ITER: 
* Two Heating [[Neutral-beam injectors|Neutral Beam injectors]] (HNB), each providing about 17MW to the burning plasma, with the possibility to add a third one. The requirements in terms of deuterium beam energy (1MeV), total current (40A) and beam pulse duration (up to 1h).{{clarify|date=December 2018}} The prototype is being built at the [[ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility|Neutral Beam Test Facility]] (NBTF),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.igi.cnr.it/www/sites/default/files/home201511/SchedaNBTF_MIUR_EN.pdf]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is being constructed in [[Padua]], Italy.
* Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH)
* Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH)

===Cryostat===
The cryostat is a large 3,800-tonne stainless steel structure surrounding the vacuum vessel and the superconducting magnets, in order to provide a super-cool vacuum environment. Its thickness ranging from {{convert|50|to|250|mm|in}} will allow it to withstand the atmospheric pressure on the area of a volume of 8,500 cubic meters. The total of 54 modules of the cryostat will be engineered, procured, manufactured, and installed by [[Larsen &amp; Toubro]] Heavy Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title= Larsen &amp; Toubro Ltd will manufacture ITER Cryostat |url=http://www.iter.org/newsline/235/1287 |date=3 September 2012 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Cooling systems===
The ITER tokamak will use three interconnected cooling systems. Most of the heat will be removed by a primary water cooling loop, itself cooled by water through a heat exchanger within the tokamak building's secondary confinement. The secondary cooling loop will be cooled by a larger complex, comprising a cooling tower, a {{cvt|5|km}} pipeline supplying water from [[Canal de Provence]], and basins that allow cooling water to be cooled and tested for chemical contamination and [[tritium]] before being released into the [[Durance River]]. This system will need to dissipate an average power of {{val|450|u=MW}} during the tokamak's operation. A [[liquid nitrogen]] system will provide a further {{val|1300|u=kW}} of cooling to {{convert|80|K|lk=in}}, and a [[liquid helium]] system will provide {{val|75|u=kW}} of cooling to {{convert|4.5|K}}. The liquid helium system will be designed, manufactured, installed and commissioned by [[Air Liquide]].&lt;ref name=Cryogenics&gt;{{cite web |title= World's largest cryogenic plant to be installed in ITER fusion reactor |url=http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/4344/20121228/largest-cryogenic-helium-plant-iter-fusion-reactor-tokamak.htm |publisher=Science World Report |date=December 2012 |accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iter.org/newsline/251/1431|title=EUR 83 million contract signed for Liquid Helium Plant|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Cadarache (red dot) CIA World Factbook map.png|thumb|Location of [[Cadarache]] in France]]

The process of selecting a location for ITER was long and drawn out. The most likely sites were Cadarache in [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]], France, and [[Rokkasho, Aomori|Rokkasho]], [[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]], Japan. Additionally, Canada announced a bid for the site in [[Clarington]] in May 2001, but withdrew from the race in 2003. Spain also offered a site at [[Vandellòs i l'Hospitalet de l'Infant|Vandellòs]] on 17 April 2002, but the EU decided to concentrate its support solely behind the French site in late November 2003. From this point on, the choice was between France and Japan. On 3 May 2005, the EU and Japan agreed to a process which would settle their dispute by July.

At the final meeting in Moscow on 28 June 2005, the participating parties agreed to construct ITER at [[Cadarache]] in [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]], France. Construction of the ITER complex began in 2007, while assembly of the tokamak itself was scheduled to begin in 2015.&lt;ref name=iter/&gt;

[[Fusion for Energy]], the [[European Union|EU]] agency in charge of the European contribution to the project, is located in [[Barcelona]], Spain. Fusion for Energy (F4E) is the European Union's Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy. According to the agency's website: &lt;blockquote&gt;F4E is responsible for providing Europe's contribution to ITER, the world's largest scientific partnership that aims to demonstrate fusion as a viable and sustainable source of energy. [...] F4E also supports fusion research and development initiatives [...]&lt;ref&gt;[http://fusionforenergy.europa.eu/aboutfusion/ The EU's Fusion for Energy website]. Fusionforenergy.europa.eu (19 April 2007). Retrieved 2013-05-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility]] aimed at developing and optimizing the neutral beam injector prototype, is being constructed in [[Padova]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igi.cnr.it The Consorzio RFX website], where the ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility is host&lt;/ref&gt; It will be the only ITER facility out of the site in Cadarache.

==Participants==
[[File:ITER participants.svg|thumb|Thirty-five countries participate in the ITER project.]]

Currently there are seven parties participating in the ITER program: the [[European Union]] (through the legally distinct organisation [[Euratom]]), [[India]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=iter/&gt; Canada was previously a full member, but has since pulled out due to a lack of funding from the federal government. The lack of funding also resulted in Canada withdrawing from its bid for the ITER site in 2003. The host member of the ITER project, and hence the member contributing most of the costs, is the EU.

In 2007, it was announced that participants in the ITER will consider [[Kazakhstan]]'s offer to join the program&lt;ref name="terra"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.energy-daily.com/reports/Kazakhstan_Offers_To_Join_International_Fusion_Power_Project_999.html|title = Kazakhstan Offers To Join International Fusion Power Project| agency = RIA Novosti|accessdate=14 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2009, Switzerland, an associate member of Euratom since 1979, also ratified the country's accession to the European Domestic Agency [[Fusion for Energy]] as a third country member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iter.org/newsline/83/531 
 |title=Switzerland officializes ITER participation |date=29 May 2009 |publisher=iter.org |accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced on 20 March 2017 that the UK will be withdrawing from Euratom and future involvement in the project is unclear.

==Funding==

As of 2016, the total price of constructing the experiment is expected to be in excess of €20 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-15/world-s-biggest-science-experiment-seeks-more-time-and-money|title=World's Biggest Science Experiment Seeks More Time and Money|last=Tirone|first=Jonathan|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of €4.6 billion of its 2010 estimate,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10614542 EU member states agree on Iter funding shortfall"], BBC, 13 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and of €9.6 billion from the 2009 estimate.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8103557.stm Fusion falters under soaring costs"], BBC, 17 June 2009 (accessed 18 June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, the proposed costs for ITER were €5 billion for the construction and €5 billion for maintenance and the research connected with it during its 35-year lifetime. At the June 2005 conference in Moscow the participating members of the ITER cooperation agreed on the following division of funding contributions: 45% by the hosting member, the European Union, and the rest split between the non-hosting members – China, India, Japan, South Korea, the Russian Federation and the USA. During the operation and deactivation phases, Euratom will contribute to 34% of the total costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713083340/http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/165&amp;format=H ITER &amp; Fusion Research press release]. Europa (web portal), 5 May 2011. Retrieved 19 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Japan's financial contribution as a non-hosting member is one-eleventh of the total, the EU agreed to grant it a special status so that Japan will provide for two-elevenths of the research staff at Cadarache and be awarded two-elevenths of the construction contracts, while the European Union's staff and construction components contributions will be cut from five-elevenths to four-elevenths.

It was reported in December 2010 that the European Parliament had refused to approve a plan by member states to reallocate €1.4 billion from the budget to cover a shortfall in ITER building costs in 2012–13. The closure of the 2010 budget required this financing plan to be revised, and the European Commission (EC) was forced to put forward an ITER budgetary resolution proposal in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12007965 Nuclear fusion finance plan rejected by EU Parliament], BBC, 16 December 2010 (accessed 19 December 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. withdrew from the ITER consortium in 2000. In 2006, Congress voted to rejoin, and again contribute financially.

==Criticism==
[[File:Stop-ITER Pertuis.jpg|thumb|Protest against ITER in France, 2009. Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns.&lt;ref name="W Wayt Gibbs"/&gt; The [[World Nuclear Association]] says that fusion "presents so far insurmountable scientific and engineering challenges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf66.htm |title=Nuclear Fusion Power |author=World Nuclear Association |year=2005 |website= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624123428/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf66.htm |archivedate=24 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A technical concern is that the 14 [[electronvolt|MeV]] neutrons produced by the fusion reactions will damage the materials from which the reactor is built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/FUSION.1999.849850|title=18th IEEE/NPSS Symposium on Fusion Engineering. Symposium Proceedings (Cat.

The damage is primarily caused by high energy neutrons knocking atoms out of their normal position in the crystal lattice. A related problem for a future commercial fusion power station is that the neutron bombardment will induce radioactivity in the reactor material itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iter.org/mach/hotcell ITER homepage: Hot Cell]. Iter.org. Retrieved 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining and decommissioning a commercial reactor may thus be difficult and expensive. Another problem is that superconducting magnets are damaged by neutron fluxes. A new special research facility, [[International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility|IFMIF]], is planned to investigate this problem.

Another source of concern comes from the 2013 tokamak parameters database interpolation which says that power load on tokamak [[divertor]]s will be five times the expected value for ITER and much more for actual electricity-generating reactors. Given that the projected power load on the ITER divertor is already very high, these new findings mean that new divertor designs should be urgently tested.&lt;ref name=Porkolab2013&gt;[http://fire.pppl.gov/FPA13_Porkolab_MIT.pdf Innovation is Key from ITER to DEMO.

A number of fusion researchers working on non-tokamak systems, such as [[Robert Bussard]] and [[Eric Lerner]], have been critical of ITER for diverting funding from what they believe could be a potentially more viable and/or cost-effective path to fusion power, such as the [[polywell]] reactor.&lt;ref name="google-bussard"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1996321846673788606| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070205120020/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1996321846673788606| archivedate = 2007-02-05| title = Should Google Go Nuclear?

YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;
Many critics accuse ITER researchers of being unwilling to face up to the technical and economic potential problems posed by tokamak fusion schemes.&lt;ref name="google-bussard"/&gt; The expected cost of ITER has risen from US$5 billion to US$20 billion, and the timeline for operation at full power was moved from the original estimate of 2016 to 2027.

A French association including about 700 anti-nuclear groups, [[Sortir du nucléaire (France)|Sortir du nucléaire]] (Get Out of Nuclear Energy), claimed that ITER was a hazard because scientists did not yet know how to manipulate the high-energy deuterium and tritium [[Isotopes of hydrogen|hydrogen isotopes]] used in the fusion process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1631650,00.html France Wins Nuclear Fusion Plant]. Deutsche Welle. Dw-world.de (28 June 2005). Retrieved 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rebecca Harms]], Green/EFA member of the [[European Parliament]]'s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, said: "In the next 50 years, nuclear fusion will neither tackle climate change nor guarantee the security of our energy supply." Arguing that the EU's energy research should be focused elsewhere, she said: "The Green/EFA group demands that these funds be spent instead on energy research that is relevant to the future. A major focus should now be put on renewable sources of energy." French Green party lawmaker [[Noël Mamère]] claims that more concrete efforts to fight present-day global warming will be neglected as a result of ITER: "This is not good news for the fight against the greenhouse effect because we're going to put ten billion euros towards a project that has a term of 30–50 years when we're not even sure it will be effective."&lt;ref name=FH2005&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/science/mixed-reactions-iter/article-141693 Mixed reactions to ITER | EurActiv] July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

ITER is not designed to produce electricity, but made as a proof of concept reactor for the later [[DEMOnstration Power Station|DEMO]] project.&lt;ref&gt;Lev Grossman, "A Star is Born", ''[[Time Magazine]]'', November 2, 2015, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to criticism===
Proponents believe that much of the ITER criticism is misleading and inaccurate, in particular the allegations of the experiment's "inherent danger." The stated goals for a commercial fusion power station design are that the amount of [[radioactive waste]] produced should be hundreds of times less than that of a fission reactor, and that it should produce no long-lived radioactive waste, and that it is impossible for any such reactor to undergo a [[nuclear meltdown|large-scale runaway chain reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iter.org/sci/Fusion|title=Advantages of fusion|newspaper=ITER|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A direct contact of the plasma with ITER inner walls would contaminate it, causing it to cool immediately and stop the fusion process. In addition, the amount of fuel contained in a fusion reactor chamber (one half gram of deuterium/tritium fuel&lt;ref name=iter/&gt;) is only sufficient to sustain the fusion burn pulse from minutes up to an hour at most, whereas a fission reactor usually contains several years' worth of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100630030449/http://www.stpnoc.com/Fyi.htm Facts and Stats... 1/3 of fuel rods changed every 18 months]. STPNOC.com.&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, some detritiation systems will be implemented, so that at a fuel cycle inventory level of about {{cvt|2|kg}}, ITER will eventually need to recycle large amounts of tritium and at turnovers orders of magnitude higher than any preceding tritium facility worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Detritiation Systems at ITER |url=http://www.asn.fr/sites/tritium/fichiers/Tritium_CHAP_2-5.pdf |publisher=French Nuclear Safety Authority |year=2010 |accessdate=12 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913054421/http://www.asn.fr/sites/tritium/fichiers/Tritium_CHAP_2-5.pdf |archivedate=13 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of an accident (or sabotage), it is expected that a fusion reactor would release far less radioactive pollution than would an ordinary fission nuclear station. Furthermore, ITER's type of fusion power has little in common with nuclear weapons technology, and does not produce the fissile materials necessary for the construction of a weapon. Proponents note that large-scale fusion power would be able to produce reliable electricity on demand, and with virtually zero pollution (no gaseous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; by-products are produced).

According to researchers at a demonstration reactor in Japan, a fusion generator should be feasible in the 2030s and no later than the 2050s. Japan is pursuing its own research program with several operational facilities that are exploring several fusion paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1088/0029-5515/45/2/004|title= Demonstration tokamak fusion power station for early realization of net electric power generation|year= 2005|last1= Hiwatari|first1=R.|last2= Okano|first2=K.|last3=Asaoka|first3= Y.|last4=Shinya|first4= K.|last5=Ogawa|first5=Y.|journal= Nuclear Fusion|volume= 45|page= 96|bibcode = 2005NucFu..45...96H|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of ITER contend that an investment in research now should be viewed as an attempt to earn a far greater future return.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Also, worldwide investment of less than US$1 billion per year into ITER is not incompatible with concurrent research into other methods of power generation, which in 2007 totaled US$16.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/Exec_summary.pdf|title=GLOBAL TRENDS IN SUSTAINABLE ENERGY INVESTMENT 2008|accessdate=10 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721182043/http://www.sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/Exec_summary.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of ITER emphasize that the only way to test ideas for withstanding the intense neutron flux is to experimentally subject materials to that flux, which is one of the primary missions of ITER and the IFMIF,&lt;ref name=iter/&gt; and both facilities will be vitally important to that effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/proceedings/2004csewgusndp/tuesday/mbphysics/09_DSmith.pdf Nuclear Data for Helium Production in Fusion]. (PDF). Retrieved 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of ITER is to explore the scientific and engineering questions that surround potential fusion power stations. It is nearly impossible to acquire satisfactory data for the properties of materials expected to be subject to an intense neutron flux, and burning plasmas are expected to have quite different properties from externally heated plasmas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Supporters contend that the answer to these questions requires the ITER experiment, especially in the light of the monumental potential benefits.

Furthermore, the main line of research via [[tokamak]]s has been developed to the point that it is now possible to undertake the penultimate step in magnetic confinement plasma physics research with a self-sustained reaction. In the tokamak research program, recent advances devoted to controlling the configuration of the plasma have led to the achievement of substantially improved energy and pressure confinement, which reduces the projected cost of electricity from such reactors by a factor of two to a value only about 50% more than the projected cost of electricity from advanced [[Light water reactor|light-water reactors]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In addition, progress in the development of advanced, low activation structural materials supports the promise of environmentally benign fusion reactors and research into alternate confinement concepts is yielding the promise of future improvements in confinement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fire.pppl.gov/fusion_critic_response_stacey.pdf Commentaries on criticisms of magnetic fusion], Weston M.

The '''International Institute of Tropical Forestry''' is a program of the [[United States Forest Service]] that was founded in 1939.  It is headquartered in [[Rio Piedras]], [[Puerto Rico]], on the grounds of the [[University of Puerto Rico]]'s Agricultural Experimental Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/iitf/about |title=About the Institute |publisher=Fs.fed.us |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events on May 20, 2014 mark the Institute's 75th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tropicalforestryinstitute.org/ |title=Commemorating 75 Years |publisher=Fs.fed.us |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''international Thorium Energy Committee''' (iThEC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ithec.org |title=iThEC |publisher=iThEC |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in late 2012 at [[CERN]] in [[Geneva]] by scientists, engineers, political figures and industrialists under the leadership of its honorary president [[Carlo Rubbia]], to promote the cause of using [[thorium]] as a means of reducing existing and future nuclear waste, and also for generating electricity.

==International conference==
After its founding, the first action of the committee was to organise an international conference on [[Thorium]], ThEC13,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indico.cern.ch/event/222140/ |title=* Thorium Energy Conference 2013 (ThEC13) * CERN Globe of Science and Innovation, Geneva, Switzerland (27-31 October 2013) |publisher=Indico.cern.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; using mostly private funding and institutional support from [[CERN]]. The conference lasted four days and attracted wide support from research institutes, energy companies and private individuals who contributed to the establishment of the current state-of-the-art in Thorium technology. Amongst the many contributions to the conference, one may note the announcement of the decision by the companies [[Solvay S.A.|Solvay]] and [[Areva]] to jointly fund research in [[Thorium]] development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SmartPlanet |url=http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/conventional-nuclear-giant-areva-strikes-thorium-deal/ |title=Conventional nuclear giant Areva strikes thorium deal |publisher=SmartPlanet |date=2013-08-26 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tests by the Norwegian company Thor energy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thorenergy.no/ |title=Thor Energy - the Norwegian thorium initiative - Thor Energy |publisher=Thorenergy.no |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Thorium]] fuel rods in the [[Halden Reactor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/10255442/Thorium-put-to-the-test-as-policymakers-rethink-nuclear.html |title=Thorium put to the test as policymakers rethink nuclear |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
The Committee is expanding its membership to reach a  wider audience and attracted to the ThEC13 conference keynote speakers such as [[Pascal Couchepin]], former president of the Swiss confederation and member of the [[Liberal Party of Switzerland]] and [[Hans Blix]], former head of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7526">The '''''Jakob Maersk''''' was an oil tanker registered in [[Denmark]] that struck a sand bank on January 29, 1975 while entering the port of [[Leixões]], [[Portugal]], causing a major [[oil spill]].&lt;ref name="Duerden"&gt;Duerden, F.C. (1976). ''Spill in Portugal: A Report of the Jakob Maersk Incident''. Environmental Emergency Branch. Environmental Protection Service. pp. 1-2, pp. 6-8, pp. 31-32. Environment Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in 1966, the tanker was owned by Maerskline Navigation Company, a subsidiary of A.P. Moller, and contracted by Shell Oil Company consisting of a crew of seventeen at the time of the accident. Seven of those seventeen crew members died during the explosion.&lt;ref name="Duerden"/&gt;

''Jakob Maersk'' was carrying 88,000 tons of [[crude oil]] from [[Kharg Island]] in [[Iran]] while entering the Port of Leixões in the northern part of Portugal to discharge the oil to the Sacor Refinery. Receiving aid from tug boats, the ship grounded on a [[sand bank]], causing a huge explosion and subsequent fire that burned for days.&lt;ref name="Duerden"/&gt;  The explosion broke the ship apart, spilling crude oil into the water.

==Oil spill==
At about 12:25 P.M. on January 29, 1975, the ship was entering the Port of Leixões in Portugal, while entering the Danish tanker hit sandbar and cause the ship to spill massive amounts of oil into the ocean followed by a few explosions inside the engine room. The cause of this infamous disaster was because of human error. 7 of those 17 crew members died in that explosion, the majority of deaths were engineers.&lt;ref name="Duerden"/&gt;

During the time of explosions, the ship began to sink causing survivors to jump into the water, the tugboat Monte de Luz assisted by rescuing survivors that were nearby.&lt;ref name="Canelas"&gt;Canelas, L. D., Calejo Monteiro, J. D. (1977). [http://www.industry-tac.org/media/technical_documents/in_situ_burning/nist_sp_995_volume1_general_information/Case_Histories/NOAA/Jakob_Maersk.htmlSome Studies of an Oil Spillage Due to the Jakob Maersk Accident]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Industry-tac.org. Retrieved April 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Jakob Maersk'' oil spill was the second largest spill at the time which occurred in the second largest city in Portugal. Out of the 40,000 to 50,000 tons of oil that were spilled consumed either by the fire or the ocean, 20,000 to 25,000 tons of that oil drifted into the sea and about 15,000 tons came to shore due to the wind direction during the first few days.&lt;ref name="Duerden"/&gt; The explosion caused thick black smoke to rise. The ship burned for 58 continuous hours.

There were reports of locals being affected by the fire that was caused but it did not escalate into serious effects or injuries.&lt;ref name="Canelas"/&gt;

==Containment and cleanup==

[[Containment]] of the oil spill began with the placement of a floating boom at the harbor entrance.  A straw barrier was placed around the wreck to briefly contain the spill while boats spread [[Bioremediation|dispersants]].The owners of the ship and the Shell company met together to decide how the oil spill was going to be clean or treated. The cleanup was the responsibility of the Portuguese Navy, Commandant Casquinno was appointed to clean up the oil spill and came up with a plan.The plan was separated into two actions, the first part of the plan was to clean up as much oil as possible that was in the water and the second part of the plan was to clean the oil that washed ashore.&lt;ref name="Duerden"/&gt;

A company called Fina Oil Company was nearby and contributed several drums of Finasol. This oil spill unlike others was very lucky due to the fact that there was an immediate response. There were boats readily available both large and small to use as transportation. Equipment was offered of all types especially heavy equipment that was necessary. Hoses and nozzles were provided by the local fire department. Labor was available from skilled to unskilled which was crucial for this operation.&lt;ref name="Duerden"/&gt;

The nearby Oporto airport made it easier to deliver specialized equipment within a near proximity. Communication was easily established in a nearby communications facility that was used as the Command Center. The type of shoreline made it an easy accessible area with fairly easy mobility of machinery and personnel. The fire that was caused was in some ways fortunate because it burned most of the fuel and if it had not been for it there would have been an even bigger mess on the shoreline.&lt;ref name="Duerden"/&gt;

BP made a huge contribution to the oil spill by contributing a chemical dispersant via airplane with 140 drums of BP 1100x on January 30, 1975, 150 of dispersant on January 31, 1975, provided a team of 5 to clean up the spill as much as possible. It was approximated that 2,000 barrels of dispersant was used to treat the oil spill. The purpose was to try and eliminate the oil on the coast using the waves as assistance to spread the dispersant. Even though it was a somewhat effective method is merely masked the oil in the sand. Later on machinery was brought in to dig up the contaminated sand and clean it using another method.&lt;ref name="Center"&gt;Center For Tankship Excellence. Jakob Maersk. c4tx.org. Retrieved April 22, 2013 from http://www.c4tx.org/ctx/job/cdb/precis.php5?key=19750129_001&lt;/ref&gt;

The most affected beach was the shore immediately adjacent to the wreck, where cleanup began with the removal of the upper layer of sand and the application of dispersants. It was bunker C oil a heavily residual oil which made it more difficult. This area was left until late in the cleanup and was extremely difficult to clean because the bunker C oil had been spread and untreated for some time. Dispersant was also added and affected very minimally due to the heavily seated bunker C. The ship's prow became stuck on a set of rocks near the [[Castelo do Queijo]] monument, remaining there for about 20 years, eventually becoming a landmark of the city until its removal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://conticasos.blogs.sapo.pt/406350.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological effects==
Ecological damage appeared to be limited.  Only half a dozen oiled birds were discovered during the first week on nearby shores.  There was no apparent harmful effect on local fish populations, although a temporary difference in taste was observed.  Dead seaweed and molluscs were found, but growth resumed shortly thereafter and populations returned to normal levels.

The cost of the catastrophe was estimated at 2.8 million dollars by the international [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

{{unreferenced|date=July 2017}} This is a '''list of silicon producers'''. The industry involves several very different stages of production.  Production starts at silicon metal, which is the  material used to gain high purity [[silicon]]. High purity silicon in different grades of purity is used for growing silicon [[ingot]]s, which are sliced to [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]]s in a process called [[wafering]]. Compositionally pure [[polycrystalline silicon]] wafers are useful for [[photovoltaics]]. Dislocation-free and extremely flat [[Monocrystalline silicon|single-crystal silicon]] wafers are required in the manufacture of computer chips.

{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}
A '''Maxwell material''' is a [[viscoelastic]] material having the properties both of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[viscosity]].&lt;ref name=roylance_EV&gt;{{cite book|last=Roylance|first=David|title=Engineering Viscoelasticity|year=2001|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=Cambridge, MA 02139|pages=8–11|url=http://web.mit.edu/course/3/3.11/www/modules/visco.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is named for [[James Clerk Maxwell]] who proposed the model in 1867.  It is also known as a Maxwell fluid.

== Definition ==

The Maxwell model can be represented by a purely viscous damper and a purely elastic spring connected in series,&lt;ref name=christensen&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=R. M|title=Theory of Viscoelasticity|year=1971|publisher=Academic Press|location=London, W1X6BA|pages=16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in the diagram.  In this configuration, under an applied axial stress, the total stress, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{Total}&lt;/math&gt; and the total strain, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\mathrm{Total}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as follows:&lt;ref name=roylance_EV /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{Total}=\sigma_D = \sigma_S&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\mathrm{Total}=\varepsilon_D+\varepsilon_S&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript D indicates the stress–strain in the damper and the subscript S indicates the stress–strain in the spring.  Taking the derivative of strain with respect to time, we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d\varepsilon_\mathrm{Total}} {dt} = \frac {d\varepsilon_D} {dt} + \frac {d\varepsilon_S} {dt} = \frac {\sigma} {\eta} + \frac {1} {E} \frac {d\sigma} {dt}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the elastic modulus and ''η'' is the material coefficient of viscosity.  This model describes the damper as a [[Newtonian fluid]] and models the spring with [[Hooke's law]].

[[Image:Maxwell diagram.svg|right]]

If we connect these two elements in parallel,&lt;ref name=christensen /&gt; we get a generalized model of [[Kelvin–Voigt material]].

In a Maxwell material, [[Stress (physics)|stress]] σ, [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] ε and their rates of change with respect to time t are governed by equations of the form:&lt;ref name=roylance_EV /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {E} \frac {d\sigma} {dt} + \frac {\sigma} {\eta} = \frac {d\varepsilon} {dt}&lt;/math&gt;

or, in dot notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\dot {\sigma}} {E} + \frac {\sigma} {\eta}= \dot {\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

The equation can be applied either to the [[shear stress]] or to the uniform tension in a material. In the former case, the viscosity corresponds to that for a [[Newtonian fluid]]. In the latter case, it has a slightly different meaning relating stress and rate of strain.

The model is usually applied to the case of small deformations. For the large deformations we should include some geometrical non-linearity. For the simplest way of generalizing the Maxwell model, refer to the [[upper-convected Maxwell model]].

== Effect of a sudden deformation ==

If a Maxwell material is suddenly deformed and held to a [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;, then the stress decays on a characteristic timescale of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\eta}{E}&lt;/math&gt;, known as the [[relaxation time]].

The picture shows dependence of dimensionless stress &lt;math&gt;\frac {\sigma(t)} {E\varepsilon_0} &lt;/math&gt; 
upon dimensionless time &lt;math&gt;\frac{E}{\eta} t&lt;/math&gt;:
[[Image:Maxwell deformation.PNG|right|thumb|400px|Dependence of dimensionless stress upon dimensionless time under constant strain|Dependence of dimensionless stress
upon dimensionless time under constant strain]]

If we free the material at time &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;, then the elastic element will spring back by the value of

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\mathrm{back} = -\frac {\sigma(t_1)} E = \varepsilon_0 \exp \left(-\frac{E}{\eta} t_1\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Since the viscous element would not return to its original length, the irreversible component of deformation can be simplified to the expression below:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\mathrm{irreversible} =  \varepsilon_0 \left(1- \exp \left(-\frac{E}{\eta} t_1\right)\right). &lt;/math&gt;

==Effect of a sudden stress ==

If a Maxwell material is suddenly subjected to a stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;, then the elastic element would suddenly deform and the viscous element would deform with a constant rate:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t) = \frac {\sigma_0} E + t \frac{\sigma_0} \eta &lt;/math&gt;

If at some time &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; we would release the material, then the deformation of the elastic element would be the spring-back deformation and the deformation of the viscous element would not change:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\mathrm{reversible} = \frac {\sigma_0} E,  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\mathrm{irreversible} =  t_1 \frac{\sigma_0} \eta. &lt;/math&gt;

The Maxwell Model does not exhibit [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] since it models strain as linear function of time.

If a small stress is applied for a sufficiently long time, then the irreversible strains become large. Thus, Maxwell material is a type of liquid.

== Dynamic modulus ==

The complex [[dynamic modulus]] of a Maxwell material would be:

:&lt;math&gt;E^*(\omega) = \frac 1 {1/E - i/(\omega \eta) } = \frac {E\eta^2 \omega^2 +i \omega E^2\eta} {\eta^2 \omega^2 + E^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the components of the dynamic modulus are :

:&lt;math&gt;E_1(\omega) = \frac {E\eta^2 \omega^2 } {\eta^2 \omega^2 + E^2} = \frac {(\eta/E)^2\omega^2} {(\eta/E)^2 \omega^2 + 1} E = \frac {\tau^2\omega^2} {\tau^2 \omega^2 + 1} E &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;E_2(\omega) = \frac {\omega E^2\eta} {\eta^2 \omega^2 + E^2} = \frac {(\eta/E)\omega} {(\eta/E)^2 \omega^2 + 1} E = \frac {\tau\omega} {\tau^2 \omega^2 + 1} E &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Megawal18.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dolmen entrances and passage grave plan]]
[[File:Megawal4.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Passage grave entrances and [[port-hole]]]]
A '''megalithic entrance''' is an [[Architecture|architectonic]] feature that enables access to a [[megalith]]ic tomb or structure. The design of the entrance has to seal the access to the [[cultic]] structure in such a way that it is possible to gain access to the interior again, even after a long time, in order to perform rituals. To that end, the practitioners of [[Nordic megalith architecture]], the [[Wartberg culture]] and [[Horgen culture]], used several variants, that are also found in other [[Megalith|megalithic regions]] in identical or slightly modified form.

As the solutions were refined in detail, they all had in common the aim of sealing the structure that its re-opening was possible under difficult but manageable conditions by the tribal community.

In general the following forms of entrance may be differentiated:

Simple dolmens (upper image)
*1. no entrance
*2. entrance on the top
*3. half-height entrance sealed with a closure stone
*4. full height half-width stone (with passage)
Dolmens (except No. 4)
*5. squared entrance (''eingewinkelter Zugang'')
*6. additional entrance to the external passage
Passage graves (lower image)
*7. triangular entrance
*8. portal entrance (with lintel)
*9. low passage entrance in front of a portal
[[Gallery grave]]s and [[stone cist]]s
*10. round (or similarly shaped) [[port-hole]]&lt;ref&gt;The German for this is ''Seelenloch'' i.e. "spirit hole".&lt;/ref&gt;

Variation 7 has its focus in the Swedish [[Bohuslän]] ([[Dolmen of Haga]]). The stones forming the entrance were so selected or fashioned that together they form a triangular entrance (top left). This special form, which effectively replaces the lintel, is also found in the region of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], e.g. at the dolmen of Banelle, which lies near [[Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort]] in the [[France|southern French]] department of [[Gard]].

The portal entrance used a [[lintel]], a horizontal block placed over two lower supporting stones in order to level out the distance to the capstone. This enabled access, usually only by crawling, through a [[trilithon]] opening (top centre), and may be seen across the whole area where Nordic megalithic architecture occurs.

In portal-like openings in the chamber wall, which, for example, have been made by leaving out a supporting stone, (bottom image: above right and below right), a passage in front of the chamber allows the cross-section of the entrance to be reduced. An example of this type of construction is the [[Sieben Steinhäuser]] in [[Lower Saxony]]. Such "chambers without (detected) passages" may be found in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. The entrance location and size determines, ultimately, whether the structure is a passage grave or a dolmen (J. Ross). In the Netherlands ([[Drenthe]]), where this form is very common, structures with no passages are known as portal graves; which otherwise, as [[portal tomb]]s form a sub-group of megalithic tombs on the [[British Isles]] but structurally have nothing in common with the sites in the province of Drenthe.

Variation 7 is not dissimilar to the so-called [[port-hole]] (bottom left), in which the front stone or, as in the diagram, two front stones are hewn out so as to create a circular access hole. The slabs were made of a material that enabled contemporary methods and tools to be used to fashion them. This version occurs [[Central Europe]] at sites built by the Wartberg and Horgen cultures in [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Switzerland]]. Some [[Sweden|Swedish]] so-called megalithic [[stone cist]]s also have port-holes. In German, such a hole is known as a ''Seelenloch'' ("soul hole"), a name that originated because of the erroneous assumption that holes were created with the intention of releasing the soul of the deceased (in the minds of the builders). In the Bronze and Iron Age sites on [[Sardinia]] and the [[Iberia|Iberian Peninsula]], similar openings are found, that are also narrow, but nearer the ground, and [[apse]]-like, (recess-shaped) with embedded closure stones.

Another feature of ground-level entrances is a so-called [[stone sill]] (''Schwellenstein''). This separates the secular or profane area of the passage from the sacred burial chamber. In some cases, it also serves to support the closure stone or slab. In some embedded [[simple dolmen]]s and [[portal tomb]] it is so high that it forms a half-height front stone, enabling access above it, and is thus part of the wall of the chamber.

[[File:Bos gaurus.jpg|thumb|[[Gaur]] at a natural salt lick]]
A '''mineral lick''' (also known as a '''salt lick''') is a place where [[animal]]s can go to [[licking|lick]] essential [[mineral nutrients]] from a deposit of [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and other [[mineral]]s. Mineral licks  can be naturally occurring or artificial (such as blocks of [[salt]] that farmers place in [[pasture]]s for [[livestock]] to lick). Natural licks are common, and they provide essential elements such as [[phosphorus]] and the [[biometal (biology)|biometals]] ([[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], and [[trace element]]s) required in the springtime for [[bone]], [[muscle]] and other growth in [[deer]] and other wildlife, such as [[moose]], [[elephant]]s, [[tapir]]s, [[cattle]], [[woodchuck]]s, [[domestic sheep]], [[fox squirrel]]s, [[mountain goat]]s and [[porcupine]]s. Such licks are especially important in [[ecosystem]]s with poor general availability of nutrients. Harsh weather exposes salty [[mineral]] deposits that draw animals from miles away for a taste of needed nutrients. It is thought that certain fauna can detect [[calcium]] in salt licks.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Calcium?topic=49557 ''Calcium''. eds. A.Jorgensen, C.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth]. National Council for Science and the Environment.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Many animals regularly visit mineral licks to consume [[clay]], supplementing their [[Dietary mineral|diet]] with nutrients and minerals. Some animals require the minerals at these sites not for nutrition, but to ward off the effects of secondary compounds that are included in the arsenal of plant defences against herbivory.&lt;ref name="Voigt08"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Voigt | first1=C.

The paths animals made to natural mineral licks and watering holes became the hunting paths predators and early man used for hunting. It is theorized that these salt and water paths became trails and later roads for early man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925341,00.html|title=A Brief History of Salt|date=1982-03-15|work=Time|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, many studies have identified other uses and nutritional benefits from other micronutrients that exist at these sites, including [[selenium]] (Se), [[cobalt]] (Co) and/or [[molybdenum]] (Mo).&lt;ref name="Mills06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mills | first1=A. | last2=Milewski | first2=A. | title=Geophagy and nutrient supplementation in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania, with particular reference to selenium, cobalt and molybdenum | journal=Journal of Zoology | volume=271 | issue=1 | pages=110–118 | year=2007 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00241.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayotte06"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ayotte |first1=J.

==Artificial salt licks==
People use salt licks in the [[animal husbandry|husbandry]] of [[livestock]] and to attract or maintain [[wildlife]], whether it be for viewing, photography, farming, or hunting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hrcranch.com/managing-the-deer-herd-on-ranch/|title=Managing the Deer Herd on Your Ranch {{!}} Hortenstine Ranch Company|date=2017-10-03|work=Hortenstine Ranch Company|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maintaining artificial salt licks as a form of [[Bait (luring substance)|baiting]] is illegal in some states in the United States, but legal in others.&lt;ref name="Atwood03" /&gt;{{rp|413}}

==In American history==
The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people of America]] and the [[Longhunter|Long Hunters]] watched salt licks to hunt game. Many became well known including [[Bledsoe's Station|Bledsoe Lick]] in [[Sumner County, Tennessee]]; the [[Blue Licks Battlefield State Park|Blue Lick]] in central [[Kentucky]]; 'Great Buffalo Lick' in [[Kanawha Salines]], now present-day [[Malden, West Virginia]]; the [[French Lick, Indiana|French Lick]] in southern [[Indiana]]; and the [[Blackwater Lick]] in [[Blackwater, Lee County, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mylonghunters.info/blackwater-virginia|title=My Long Hunters - Blackwater, VirginiaBlackwater, Virginia - My Long Hunters|website=mylonghunters.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2011}}

==Mythology==
In [[Norse mythology]], before the creation of the world, it was the divine cow [[Auðumbla|Audhumla]] who, through her licking of the cosmic salt ice, gave form to [[Búri|Buri]], ancestor of the [[Æsir|gods]] and grandfather of [[Odin]]. On the first day as Audhumla licked, Buri's hair appeared from the ice, on the second day his head and on the third his body.&lt;ref&gt;[[Prose Edda]] by [[Snorri Sturluson]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18819">[[File:Hiroshima aftermath.jpg|right|thumb|Since the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], nuclear weapons have remained highly controversial and contentious objects in the forum of public debate.]]
[[Image:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb|U.S. and USSR/Russian nuclear weapons stockpiles, 1945–2005.|alt=A graph showing evolution of number of nuclear weapons in the US and USSR and in the period 1945-2005. US dominates early and USSR later years with and crossover around 1978.]]

The '''nuclear weapons debate''' refers to the controversies surrounding the threat, use and stockpiling of [[nuclear weapons]]. Even before the first nuclear weapons had been developed, scientists involved with the [[Manhattan Project]] were divided over the use of the weapon. The only time nuclear weapons have been used in [[warfare]] was during the final stages of [[World War II]] when [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[B-29 Superfortress]] [[bombers]] [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] in early August 1945. The role of the bombings in [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] and the U.S.'s [[Nuclear ethics|ethical]] justification for them have been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades.
 
[[Nuclear disarmament]] refers both to the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world. Proponents of disarmament typically condemn [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] the threat or use of nuclear weapons as immoral and argue that only total disarmament can eliminate the possibility of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] and make conventional wars more likely, more destructive, or both. The debate becomes considerably complex when considering various scenarios for example, total vs partial or [[Unilateralism|unilateral]] vs [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] disarmament.

==History==
[[Image:Nagasakibomb.jpg|thumb|The [[Fat Man]] [[mushroom cloud]] resulting from the [[nuclear explosion]] over [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].]]
Even before the first nuclear weapons had been developed, scientists involved with the [[Manhattan Project]] were divided over the use of the weapon. Some—notably a number at the [[University of Chicago]] [[Metallurgical Laboratory]], represented in part by [[Leó Szilárd]]—lobbied early on that the atomic bomb should only be built as a [[deterrence theory|deterrent]] against Nazi Germany getting a bomb, and should not be used against populated cities. The [[Franck Report]] argued in June 1945 that instead of being used against a city, the first atomic bomb should be "demonstrated" to the Japanese on an uninhabited area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Schollmeyer | first = Josh | title = ''Minority Report'' | work = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | date = January–February 2005 | url = http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/c44g1634464675j7/?p=b09a34e5df624f6ba81f091a260ea38f&amp;pi=9 | accessdate = 2009-08-04 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160514002233/http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/c44g1634464675j7/?p=b09a34e5df624f6ba81f091a260ea38f&amp;pi=9 | archivedate = 2016-05-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This recommendation was not agreed with by the military commanders, the Los Alamos Target Committee (made up of other scientists), or the politicians who had input into the use of the weapon. Because the Manhattan Project was considered to be "[[top secret]]", there was no public discussion of the use of nuclear arms, and even within the U.S. government, knowledge of the bomb was extremely limited.

The [[Little Boy]] atomic bomb was detonated over the [[Japan]]ese city of [[Hiroshima]] on 6 August 1945. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500&amp;nbsp;tonnes of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings (including the [[headquarters]] of the [[Second General Army (Japan)|2nd General Army]] and [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Fifth Division]]) and killed approximately 75,000 people, among them 20,000 Japanese soldiers and 20,000 Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=2001 |chapter=Uranium |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A to Z Guide to the Elements |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn=0-19-850340-7 |authorlink=John Emsley |first=John |last=Emsley |pages=478 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detonation of the "[[Fat Man]]" atomic bomb exploded over the Japanese city of [[Nagasaki]] three days later on 9 August 1945, destroying 60% of the city and killing approximately 35,000 people, among them 23,200-28,200 Japanese civilian munitions workers and 150 Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nuke-Rebuke: Writers &amp; Artists Against Nuclear Energy &amp; Weapons (The Contemporary anthology series) |pages=22–29 |date=May 1, 1984 |publisher=The Spirit That Moves Us Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the bombings in [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] and the U.S.'s [[Nuclear ethics|ethical]] justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades.

In the early 1980s, following a revival of the [[nuclear arms race]], a popular [[Anti-nuclear movement|nuclear disarmament movement]] emerged. In October 1981 half a million people took to the streets in several cities in Italy, more than 250,000 people protested in Bonn, 250,000 demonstrated in London, and 100,000 marched in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;David Cortright (2008).

==Arguments==
Under the scenario of total multilateral disarmament, there is no possibility of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Under scenarios of partial disarmament, there is disagreement as to how the probability of nuclear war would change. Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine the ability of governments to threaten sufficient retaliation upon an attack to [[Deterrence theory|deter]] aggression against them. Application of [[game theory]] to questions of strategic nuclear warfare during the [[Cold War]] resulted in the doctrine of [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD), a concept developed, by Robert S. McNamara, among others, in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Jeffrey M. and Robert Reginald. (1989). The Arms Control, Disarmament, and Military Security Dictionary, Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of MAD in averting nuclear war was theorized to depend upon the “readiness at any time before, during, or after an attack to destroy the adversary as a functioning society."&lt;ref&gt;Gertcher, Frank L., and William J. Weida. (1990). Beyond Deterrence, Boulder: Westview Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who believe governments should develop or maintain nuclear-strike capability, usually justify their position with reference to MAD and the Cold War, claiming that a "[[nuclear peace]]" was the result of both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. possessing mutual second-strike retaliation capability. Since the end of the cold war, theories of deterrence in international relations have been further developed and generalized in the concept of the [[stability–instability paradox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stimson.org/search/google/images%20uploads%20research%20pdfs%20ESCCONTROLCHAPTER1%20pdf|title=Oops, page not found (404 error)|author=|date=|website=Stimson Center|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krepon.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/2911/the-stability-instability-paradox|title=The Stability-Instability Paradox|last=Krepon|first=Michael|date=November 2, 2010|website=Arms Control Wonk|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112223352/http://krepon.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/2911/the-stability-instability-paradox|archivedate=January 12, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of disarmament call into question the assumption that political leaders are rational actors who place the protection of their citizens above other considerations, and highlight, as McNamara himself later acknowledged with the benefit of hindsight, the non-rational choices, chance and contingency which played a significant role in averting nuclear war, for example during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 and the [[Able Archer 83]] crisis of 1983,&lt;ref&gt;James G Blight, Janet M. Lang. The Fog of War: Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara, page 60.&lt;/ref&gt; thus, they argue, evidence trumps theory and deterrence theories cannot be reconciled with the historical record.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2263">Commonly referred as phosphorescence, '''persistent luminescence''' is the phenomenon encountered in materials which make them glow in the dark after the end of an [[Excited state|excitation]] with UV or visible light.

==Mechanism==
The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;T. Aitasalo, P. Deren, J. Hölsä, H. Jungner, J.C. Krupa, M. Lastusaari, J. Legendziewicz,
J. Niittykoski, and W. Strek. Persistent luminescence phenomena in materials doped with
rare earth ions. ''J. Solid State Chem.'', 171 :114, '''2003'''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the phenomenon of persistent luminescence must not be mistaken with [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]] (see for definitions &lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/F02453.html IUPAC Gold Book - fluorescence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04569.html IUPAC Gold Book - phosphorescence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). Indeed, in fluorescence, the lifetime of the excited state is in the order of a few nanoseconds and in phosphorescence, even if the lifetime of the emission can reach several seconds, the reason of the long emission is due to the deexcitation between two electronic states of different [[spin multiplicity]]. For persistent luminescence, it has been known for a long time that the phenomenon involved energy traps (such as electron or hole trap) in a material&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Leverenz. Luminescent solids (phosphors). ''Science'', 109 :183–189, '''1949'''.&lt;/ref&gt; which are filled during the excitation. After the end of the excitation, the stored energy is gradually released to emitter centers which emit light usually by a fluorescence-like mechanism.

==Examples of use==
Persistent luminescence materials are mainly used in safety signs, watch dials, decorative objects and toys. They have also been used as nanoprobes in small animal optical imaging.&lt;ref&gt;Q. le Masne de Chermont, C. Chanéac, J. Seguin, F. Pellé, S. Maitrejean, J.P. Jolivet, D. Gourier, M. Bessodes and D.

[[Image:MPD plume.jpg|thumb|right|A thruster during test firing]]
[[File:VASIMR spacecraft.jpg|thumb|right|Artist rendition of [[VASIMR]] plasma engine]]
A '''plasma propulsion engine''' is a type of [[electric propulsion]] that generates thrust from a quasi-neutral [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This is in contrast to [[ion thruster]] engines, which generate thrust through extracting an ion current from [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] source, which is then accelerated to high velocities using grids/anodes. These exist in many forms (see [[electric propulsion]]). 
Plasma thrusters do not typically use high voltage grids or anodes/ cathodes to accelerate the charged particles in the plasma, but rather uses currents and potentials which are generated internally in the plasma to accelerate the plasma ions. While this results in a lower exhaust velocities by virtue of the lack of high accelerating voltages, this type of thruster has a number of interesting advantages. The lack of high voltage grids of anodes removes a possible limiting element as a result of grid ion erosion. The plasma exhaust is 'quasi-neutral', which means that ion and electrons exist in equal number, which allows simply ion-electron recombination in the exhaust to neutralise the exhaust plume, removing the need for an electron gun (hollow cathode). This type of thruster often generates the source plasma using radio frequency or microwave energy, using an external antenna. This fact, combined with the absence of hollow cathodes (which are very sensitive to all but the few noble gases) allows the intriguing possibility of being able to use this type of thruster on a huge range of propellants, from argon, to carbon dioxide, air mixtures to astronaut urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvice.com/archives/2012/06/aussie_helicon.php |title= Australian National University develops helicon plasma thruster |author= |date=January 2010 |website= |publisher=Dvice |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plasma engines are  better suited for long-distance [[Interplanetary travel|interplanetary space travel]] missions.&lt;ref name="plasma rocket"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2010/01/07/tech-space-plasma-rocket-nautel.html?ref=rss |title=N.S. company helps build plasma rocket |author= |date=January 2010 |work= |publisher=cbcnews |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, many agencies have developed several forms of plasma-fueled engines, including the [[European Space Agency]], [[Iranian Space Agency]] and [[Australian National University]], which have co-developed a more advanced type described as a [[Helicon Double Layer Thruster|double layer thruster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4527696.stm | work=BBC News | title=Plasma engine passes initial test | date=14 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23431264-500-plasma-jet-engines-that-could-take-you-from-the-ground-to-space/|title=Plasma jet engines that could take you from the ground to space|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this form of plasma engine is only one of many types.

== Advantages ==

Plasma engines have a much higher [[Specific impulse|specific impulse (I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;)]] value than most other types of rocket technology. The [[Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket|VASIMR]] engine is capable of reaching an impulse value of over 12000, while [[Hall-effect thruster|hall thrusters]] can reach about 2000. This is much higher than the chemical bipropellant fuel that is sometimes used that can reach a specific impulse of 450.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dsiac.org/resources/journals/dsiac/spring-2017-volume-4-number-2/space-travel-aided-plasma-thrusters-past|title=Space Travel Aided by Plasma Thrusters: Past, Present and Future {{!}} DSIAC|website=www.dsiac.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With high impulse, these rockets are capable of reaching relatively high speeds. Ex-astronaut [[Franklin Chang Díaz|Franklin Chang-Diaz]] claims his [[Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket|VASIMR]] engine could send a payload to Mars in as little as 39 days while reaching a max velocity of 34 miles per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/technology/antimatter-ion-drives-nasas-plans-deep-space-propulsion|title=Antimatter to ion drives: NASA's plans for deep space propulsion|website=Cosmos Magazine|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend is the same for other plasma rockets.

Certain plasma thrusters, such as the mini-helicon, are hailed for their simple design and ease of use. With cheap fuel (a large number of gases or combinations of gases can be used as fuel), and relatively simple theory of performance, plasma rockets can be used more than once, and be easily built. Plasma rockets also do not have to spend all of their fuel all at once unlike traditional chemical rockets. This allows plasma rockets to change speed in flight, and even change direction midflight as well.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090223221524.htm|title=Rocket Aims For Cheaper Nudges In Space; Plasma Thruster Is Small, Runs On Inexpensive Gases|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drawbacks ==

For some plasma thruster technologies, such as Berkant Goksel's tiny plasma thruster, one of the largest problems is generating enough electricity to turn gases into plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23431264-500-plasma-jet-engines-that-could-take-you-from-the-ground-to-space/|title=Plasma jet engines that could take you from the ground to space|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same problem plagues Diaz's VASIMR thruster. Diaz's device would need so much electricity, that any vehicle that uses a VASIMR engine would also need several nuclear reactors in order to generate enough power. Not only would the reactors add mass to the payload, this has caused concern by some who fear the possible fallout caused by an explosion of the reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-10/123000-mph-plasma-engine-could-finally-take-astronauts-mars|title=The 123,000 MPH Plasma Engine That Could Finally Take Astronauts To Mars|work=Popular Science|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this possibility, [[NASA]] has previously stopped research in nuclear reactors that could be sent up into space.

Another common issue plasma rockets have run into is the possibility of the rocket breaking itself. Over time, the plasma these rockets produce will damage the walls of the device ultimately causing it to break. This means that on a mission to Mars, it is possible that the rocket will destroy itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2016-07-mars-immortal-plasma-rockets.html|title=Traveling to Mars with immortal plasma rockets|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, due to their low thrust, plasma engines are not suitable for sending large payloads into space. On average, these rockets provide about 2 pounds of thrust maximum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is a problem since in order to be financially efficient, heavy payloads need to be sent up every time a mission is scheduled. While plasma engines could take over once in space, chemical rockets would be needed to launch the vehicle.

== Plasma engines in use ==

While most plasma engines are still confined to the laboratory, some have seen active flight time and use on missions. As of 2011, NASA, partnered with aerospace company [[Busek]], launched the first hall thruster into space aboard the [[TacSat-2|Tacsat-2]] satellite. The thruster was the satellite's main propulsion system. Since then, the company has launched another hall effect thruster in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.busek.com/flightprograms__ts2.htm|title=TacSat-2|website=www.busek.com|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time progresses, more plasma thrusters are likely to see flight time on objects that have left Earth's surface. 

== Engine types ==

=== Helicon double layer thrusters ===
{{main|Helicon double-layer thruster}}Helicon thrusters use low-frequency electromagnetic waves (Helicon waves) that exist inside plasma when exposed to a magnetic field. An R-F antennae that wraps around a chamber of gas is used to create the waves and excite the gas. Once the energy provided by the antennae couples with the gas a plasma is created. Once the plasma is formed, the plasma is accelerated out of the engine using a magnetic field of ideal topology. Mini-helicon thrusters, invented by Oleg Batishcev, are small simple thrusters ideal for small maneuvers in space. These thrusters are capable of running off of many different fuels making these simple rockets ideal for long term missions. Its simple design also makes it versatile in that it can be made out of simple materials such as a glass soda bottle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090223221524.htm|title=Rocket Aims For Cheaper Nudges In Space; Plasma Thruster Is Small, Runs On Inexpensive Gases|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2017-07-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters ===
{{main|Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster}}

[[Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster]]s (MPD) use the [[Lorentz force]] (a force resulting from the interaction between a [[magnetic field]] and an [[electric current]]) to generate thrust—the electric charge flowing through the plasma in the presence of a magnetic field causing the plasma to [[accelerate]] due to the generated magnetic force.
The [[Lorentz force]] is also crucial to the operation of most [[pulsed plasma thruster]]

=== Pulsed inductive thrusters ===
{{main|Pulsed inductive thruster}}

[[Pulsed inductive thruster]]s (PIT) also use the Lorentz force to generate thrust, but unlike the magnetoplasmadynamic thruster, they do not use any electrode, preventing their erosion. Ionization and electric currents in the plasma are induced by a rapidly varying magnetic field.

=== Electrodeless plasma thrusters ===
{{main|Electrodeless plasma thruster}}

[[Electrodeless plasma thruster]]s  use the [[ponderomotive force]] which acts on any plasma or [[charged particle]] when under the influence of a strong [[electromagnetic energy]] density [[gradient]] to [[accelerate]] both electrons and ions of the plasma in the same direction, thereby able to operate without neutralizer.

=== Hall effect thrusters ===
{{main|Hall effect thruster}}

[[Hall effect thruster]]s (also called stationary plasma thrusters SPT) combine a strong localized static magnetic field perpendicular to the electric field created between an upstream anode and a downstream cathode called neutralizer, to create a "virtual cathode" (area of high electron density) at the exit of the device. This virtual cathode then attracts the ions formed inside the thruster closer to the anode. Finally the accelerated ion beam is neutralized by some of the electrons emitted by the neutralizer.
Serial production of Hall effect thruster started in [[Soviet Union]] in the 1970s. One of the early variants, SPT-100 is now produced under license by European Snecma Moteurs under the name PPS-1350. Similarly BPT-4000 and PPS-5000 are closely related to SPT-140.
SPT-290 has a thrust of 1.5N, 5-30&amp;nbsp;kW power and specific impulse 30&amp;nbsp;km/s, efficiency 65% and weight 23&amp;nbsp;kg.

[[File:Vasimr.png|thumb|right|VASIMR]]

=== VASIMR ===
{{main|Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket}}

VASIMR, short for Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, uses [[radio waves]] to [[ion]]ize a [[propellant]] into a plasma. Then, a [[magnetic field]] accelerates the plasma from the [[rocket engine]], generating [[thrust]].
The VASIMR is being developed by [[Ad Astra Rocket Company]], headquartered in Houston, TX. A [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]-based company [[Nautel]], is producing the 200&amp;nbsp;kW RF generators required to ionize the propellant. Some component tests and "Plasma Shoot" experiments are performed in a [[Liberia, Costa Rica]] laboratory.
This project is led by former NASA astronaut Dr. [[Franklin Chang-Díaz]] (CRC-USA).

The Costa Rican Aerospace Alliance has announced development of an exterior support for the VASIMR to be fitted outside the [[International Space Station]]. This phase of the plan to test the VASIMR in space is expected to be conducted in 2016. A projected 200 megawatt VASIMR engine could reduce the time to travel from Earth to Jupiter or Saturn from six years to fourteen months, and from Earth to Mars from 6 months to 39 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.busek.com/flightprograms__ts2.htm|title=TacSat-2|website=www.busek.com|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Potassium bromide''' ([[Potassium|K]][[Bromine|Br]]) is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], widely used as an [[anticonvulsant]] and a [[sedative]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with over-the-counter use extending to 1975 in the US. Its action is due to the [[bromide]] ion ([[sodium bromide]] is equally effective). Potassium bromide is used as a veterinary drug, as an antiepileptic medication for dogs.

Under standard conditions, potassium bromide is a white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water; it is not soluble in acetonitrile. In a dilute aqueous solution, potassium bromide tastes sweet, at higher concentrations it tastes bitter, and tastes salty when the concentration is even higher.{{by how much|date=August 2013}} These effects are mainly due to the properties of the potassium ion—sodium bromide tastes salty at any concentration. In high concentration, potassium bromide strongly irritates the gastric mucous membrane, causing nausea and sometimes vomiting (a typical effect of all soluble potassium salts).

==Chemical properties==
Potassium bromide, a typical [[ionic salt]], is fully dissociated and near [[pH]] 7 in [[aqueous]] solution. It serves as a source of bromide ions. This reaction is important for the manufacture of [[silver bromide]] for [[photographic film]]:

:KBr([[aqueous|aq]]) + [[Silver nitrate|AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]([[aqueous|aq]]) → [[Silver bromide|AgBr]]([[solid|s]]) + [[Potassium nitrate|KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]([[aqueous|aq]])

Aqueous bromide Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; also forms [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] when reacted with some metal halides such as [[copper(II) bromide]]:

:2 KBr([[aqueous|aq]]) + [[copper(II) bromide|CuBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]([[aqueous|aq]]) → K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[CuBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]([[aqueous|aq]])

==Preparation==
A traditional method for the manufacture of KBr is the reaction of [[potassium carbonate]] with an iron([[Iron(III) bromide|III]], [[Iron(II) bromide|II]]) bromide, Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, made by treating scrap iron under water with excess [[bromine]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tititudorancea.com/z/potassium_bromide.htm|title=Potassium bromide|work=The Titi Tudorancea Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:4 [[potassium carbonate|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; → 8 KBr + [[iron(II,III) oxide|Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 4 [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

==Applications==

===Medical and veterinary===
[[File:Potassium bromide veterinary.JPG|thumb|left|200 px|A bottle of PRN Pharmaceutical Company (Pensacola, FL) '''K•BroVet''' veterinary pharmaceutical potassium bromide oral solution (250 mg/mL). The product is intended to be used in dogs, primarily as an [[antiepileptic]] (to stop seizures). The pink color of the solution is artificial; pure potassium bromide solutions are colorless]]

The anticonvulsant properties of potassium bromide were first noted by Sir Charles Locock at a meeting of the [[Medical and Chirurgical Society of London|Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society]] in 1857. Bromide can be regarded as the first effective medication for [[epilepsy]]. At the time, it was commonly thought that epilepsy was caused by masturbation.&lt;ref name="Goodman1970"&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Goodman | last2 =Gilman | edition =4th | chapter =Chapter 10: Hypnotics and Sedatives | pages =121–2 | title = The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics | publisher = MacMillan | year =1970 | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locock noted that bromide calmed sexual excitement and thought this was responsible for his success in treating seizures. In the latter half of the 19th century, potassium bromide was used for the calming of seizure and nervous disorders on an enormous scale, with the use by single hospitals being as much as several tons a year (the dose for a given person being a few grams per day).&lt;ref name="Goodman1970"/&gt; By the beginning of the 20th century the generic word had become so widely associated with being sedate that [[Bromide (language)|bromide]] came to mean a dull, sedate person or a boring [[platitude]] uttered by such a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf |first=Alan A.|title=Predicting New Words - The Secrets of Their Success |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACsetPyuv8YC |accessdate=27 August 2017 |year=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-618-13006-1 |pages=36–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was not a better epilepsy drug until [[phenobarbital]] in 1912. The [[British Army]] has historically been claimed to lace soldiers' [[tea]] with bromide to quell sexual arousal but that is likely untrue as doing so would also diminish alertness in battle. Similar stories exist about a number of substances.{{citation needed|reason=Snopes is not a peer reviewed journal|date=May 2016}}

Bromide compounds, especially [[sodium bromide]], remained in over-the-counter sedatives and headache remedies (such as the original formulation of [[Bromo-Seltzer]]) in the US until 1975, when bromides were outlawed in all over-the-counter medicines, due to chronic toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url =https://books.google.com/?id=fd_S2Van52EC&amp;dq=%22The+Great+American+Fraud%22&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title = The Great American Fraud | author1 =Adams | first1 =Samuel Hopkins | year =1905 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bromide's exceedingly long half life in the body made it difficult to dose without side effects. Medical use of bromides in the US was discontinued at this time, as many better and shorter-acting sedatives were known by then.

Potassium bromide is used in veterinary medicine to treat [[epilepsy in dogs]], either as first-line treatment or in addition to phenobarbital, when seizures are not adequately controlled with phenobarbital alone. Use of bromide in cats is limited because it carries a substantial risk of causing lung inflammation (pneumonitis) in them. The use of bromide as a treatment drug for animals means that veterinary medical diagnostic laboratories are able as a matter of routine to measure serum levels of bromide on order of a veterinarian, whereas human medical diagnostic labs in the US do not measure bromide as a routine test.

Potassium bromide is not approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use in humans to control seizures. In Germany, it is still approved as an antiepileptic drug for humans, particularly children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apotheken-umschau.de/Medikamente/Beipackzettel/DIBRO-BE-MONO-850mg-4648235.html German leaflet]&lt;/ref&gt; These indications include severe forms of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, early-childhood-related Grand-Mal-seizures, and also severe myoclonic seizures during childhood. Adults who have reacted positively to the drug during childhood/adolescence may continue treatment. Potassium bromide tablets are sold under the brand name ''Dibro-Be mono'' (Rx-only). The drug has almost complete bioavailability, but the bromide ion has a relatively long half life of 12 days in the blood,&lt;ref name="Goodman1970"/&gt; making bromide salts difficult to adjust and dose. Bromide is not known to interfere with the absorption or excretion of any other anticonvulsant, though it does have strong interactions with chloride in the body, the normal body uptake and excretion of which strongly influences bromide's excretion.&lt;ref name="Goodman1970"/&gt;

The therapeutic index (ratio of effectiveness to toxicity) for bromide is small. As with other antiepileptics, sometimes even therapeutic doses (3 to 5&amp;nbsp;grams per day, taking 6 to 8 weeks to reach stable levels) may give rise to intoxication. Often indistinguishable from 'expected' side-effects, these include:

*''[[Bromism]]'' These are central nervous system reactions. They may include:
:depression,
:[[lethargy]], [[somnolence]] (from daytime sleepiness to [[coma]])
:loss of appetite and [[cachexia]], nausea/emesis with [[exicosis]] (loss of body fluid)
:loss of [[reflexes]] or pathologic reflexes
:[[clonic seizures]]
:[[tremor]]
:[[ataxia]]
:loss of neural sensitivity
:[[paresis]]
:[[cerebral edema]] with associated headache and [[papilledema]] of the eyes
:[[delirium]]: confusion, abnormal speech, loss of concentration and memory, aggressiveness
:[[psychosis]]

*Acne-form dermatitis and other forms of skin disease may also be seen, as well as mucous hypersecretion in the lungs. Asthma and rhinitis may worsen. Rarely, tongue disorder, [[aphthous stomatitis]], [[halitosis|bad breath]], and [[constipation]] occur.

===Optics===
Potassium bromide is transparent from the near [[ultraviolet]] to long-wave [[infrared]] [[wavelength]]s (0.25-25&amp;nbsp;µm) and has no significant [[optical absorption]] lines in its high transmission region.
It is used widely as infrared optical windows and components for general spectroscopy because of its wide spectral range. In [[infrared spectroscopy]], samples are analyzed by grinding with powdered potassium bromide and pressing into a disc. Alternatively, samples may be analyzed as a liquid film (neat, as a solution, or in a mull with [[Nujol]]) between two polished potassium bromide discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/Spectrpy/InfraRed/infrared.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071027110406/http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/Spectrpy/InfraRed/infrared.htm | archivedate = 2007-10-27 | work = VirtualText of Organic Chemistry | title = Infrared Spectroscopy | author = Reusch, W. | accessdate = 18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its high solubility and [[hygroscopic]] nature it must be kept in a dry environment. The [[refractive index]] is about 1.55 at 1.0&amp;nbsp;µm.

===Photography===
In addition to manufacture of silver bromide, potassium bromide is used as a restrainer in [[black and white]] [[Photographic developer|developer]] formulas. It improves differentiation between exposed and unexposed crystals of silver halide, and thus reduces fog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:FNB Rus 2017.png|thumb|National Wealth Fund, 2008-2017]]
The '''Russian National Wealth Fund''' is [[Russia]]'s [[sovereign wealth fund]]. It was created after the [[Stabilization Fund of the Russian Federation]] was split into two separate investment funds on 30 January 2008. The two funds are the [[Russian Reserve Fund|Reserve Fund]], which is invested abroad in low-yield securities and used when oil and gas incomes fall, and the National Wealth Fund, which invests in riskier, higher return vehicles, as well as federal budget expenditures. The Reserve Fund was given $125 billion and the National Wealth Fund was given $32 billion. The fund is controlled by the Ministry of Finance. One of the fund's main responsibilities is to support the Russian [[pension]] system.&lt;ref name=FT181213UBdPU&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3b3db13c-67e3-11e3-a905-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2nvq5n9ta Ukraine bailout could derail Putin's drive to boost Russian economy], ''[[Financial Times]]'' (18 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Wealth Fund will receive funds from investment returns or any excess funds that the Reserve Fund produces. The Reserve Fund is capped at 10% of Russian [[GDP]], and any funds over that will be given to the Wealth Fund. The fund also has accumulated $72.71bn (as of 1 September 2016) from taxes and duties it collects on the production and export of oil and gas.&lt;ref name=FT181213UBdPU/&gt;

According to the [[Russian Ministry of Finance]], the foreign debt securities the fund can invest in must have ratings of AA- or higher by [[Fitch Ratings|Fitch]] or [[Standard &amp; Poor's]], or a rating of Aa3 by [[Moody's Investors Service|Moody's]].&lt;ref name=FT181213UBdPU/&gt; Despite this, the [[Euromaidan#17_December_Ukrainian-Russian_action_plan_and_after|fund agreed to buy (on 17 December 2013)]] $15 billion of Ukrainian [[Eurobond]]s, despite the fact that [[Ukraine]] had lower credit ratings at the time.&lt;ref name=FT181213UBdPU/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCGPU171213&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25411118 Russia cuts Ukraine gas price by a third], [[BBC News]] (17 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IUEB171213&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/182491.html Ukraine to issue Eurobonds; Russia will purchase $15 bln, says Russian finance minister], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (17 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian National Wealth Fund was merged in 2017 with the remaining of [[Russia’s sovereign Reserve Fund]]. The Reserve fund was built up over years with profits from oil exports but amid low oil price prices was emptied by the end of 2017 and ceased to exist.

{{infobox seaborgium}}
'''Seaborgium''' is a synthetic [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Sg''' and [[atomic number]] 106. It is named after the American [[nuclear chemist]] [[Glenn T. Seaborg]]. As a [[synthetic element]], it can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. It is also [[radioactive]]; the most stable known [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;Sg, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 3.1&amp;nbsp;minutes.

In the [[periodic table]] of the elements, it is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and belongs to the [[group 6 elements]] as the fourth member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that seaborgium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[tungsten]] in group 6. The chemical properties of seaborgium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 6 elements.

In 1974, a few atoms of seaborgium were produced in laboratories in the [[Soviet Union]] and in the United States. The priority of the discovery and therefore the [[Transfermium Wars|naming of the element was disputed]] between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) established seaborgium as the official name for the element. It is one of only two elements named after a living person at the time of naming, the other being [[oganesson]], element 118.

==History==
Two groups claimed [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery of the element]]. Evidence of element 106 was first reported in 1974 by a Russian research team in [[Dubna]] led by [[Yuri Oganessian]], in which targets of [[lead-208]] and [[lead-207]] were bombarded with accelerated ions of [[chromium-54]]. In total, fifty-one [[spontaneous fission]] events were observed with a half-life between four and ten [[milliseconds]]. After having ruled out nucleon [[Nuclear reaction#Transfer reactions|transfer reactions]] as a cause for these activities, the team concluded that the most likely cause of the activities was the spontaneous fission of isotopes of element 106. The isotope in question was first suggested to be seaborgium-259, but was later corrected to seaborgium-260.&lt;ref name="93TWG"&gt;{{Cite journal

A few months later in 1974, researchers including Glenn T. Seaborg, [[Carol Alonso]] and [[Albert Ghiorso]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and E. Kenneth Hulet from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], also synthesized the element&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=A. Ghiorso, J. M. Nitschke, J. R. Alonso, C. T. Alonso, M. Nurmia, G.

The alpha daughter rutherfordium-259 and granddaughter nobelium-255 had previously been synthesised and the properties observed here matched with those previously known, as did the intensity of their production. The [[cross-section (physics)|cross-section]] of the reaction observed, 0.3&amp;nbsp;[[barn (unit)|nanobarns]], also agreed well with theoretical predictions. These bolstered the assignment of the alpha decay events to seaborgium-263m.&lt;ref name=93TWG/&gt;

A dispute thus arose from the initial competing claims of discovery, though unlike the case of the synthetic elements up to [[dubnium|element 105]], neither team of discoverers chose to announce proposed names for the new elements, thus averting an [[element naming controversy]] temporarily. The dispute on discovery, however, dragged on until 1992, when the IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG), formed to put an end to the controversy by making conclusions regarding discovery claims for elements 101 to [[copernicium|112]], concluded that the Soviet synthesis of seaborgium-260 was not convincing enough, "lacking as it is in yield curves and angular selection results", whereas the American synthesis of seaborgium-263 was convincing due to its being firmly anchored to known daughter nuclei. As such, the TWG recognised the Berkeley team as official discoverers in their 1993 report.&lt;ref name=93TWG/&gt;

[[File:Seaborg in lab.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.0|Element 106 was named after [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], a pioneer in the discovery of [[synthetic element]]s, with the name ''seaborgium'' (Sg).]]
[[File:Glenn Seaborg seaborgium.jpg|thumb|right|An aged Seaborg pointing to the element named after him on the periodic table]]
Seaborg had previously suggested to the TWG that if Berkeley was recognised as the official discoverer of elements 104 and 105, they might propose the name ''kurchatovium'' (symbol Kt) for element 106 to honour the Dubna team, which had proposed this name for element 104 after [[Igor Kurchatov]], the former head of the [[Soviet nuclear research]] programme. However, due to the worsening relations between the competing teams after the publication of the TWG report (because the Berkeley team vehemently disagreed with the TWG's conclusions, especially regarding element 104), this proposal was dropped from consideration by the Berkeley team.&lt;ref name=transuranium&gt;Hoffman, D.C., Ghiorso, A., Seaborg, G. T. The Transuranium People: The Inside Story, (2000), 369–399&lt;/ref&gt; After being recognized as official discoverers, the Berkeley team started deciding on a name in earnest:

{{quotation|...we were given credit for the discovery and the accompanying right to name the new element. The eight members of the Ghiorso group suggested a wide range of names honoring Isaac Newton, Thomas Edison, Leonardo da Vinci, Ferdinand Magellan, the mythical Ulysses, George Washington, and Finland, the native land of a member of the team. There was no focus and no front-runner for a long period.&lt;br&gt;Then one day Al [Ghiorso] walked into my office and asked what I thought of naming element 106 "seaborgium." I was floored.&lt;ref name=vanderkrogt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=sg |title=106 Seaborgium  |publisher=Elements.vanderkrogt.net |accessdate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=Glenn Seaborg}}

Seaborg's son Eric remembered the naming process as follows:&lt;ref name=EricSeaborg/&gt;

{{quotation|With eight scientists involved in the discovery suggesting so many good possibilities, Ghiorso despaired of reaching consensus, until he awoke one night with an idea. He approached the team members one by one, until seven of them had agreed. He then told his friend and colleague of 50 years: "We have seven votes in favor of naming element 106 seaborgium. Will you give your consent?" My father was flabbergasted, and, after consulting my mother, agreed.&lt;ref name=EricSeaborg&gt;{{cite journal|first = Seaborg|last = Eric|date = 2003 |title = Seaborgium|journal = Chemical and Engineering News|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/seaborgium.html|volume = 81|issue = 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=Eric Seaborg}}

The name ''seaborgium'' and symbol ''Sg'' were announced at the 207th national meeting of the [[American Chemical Society]] in March 1994 by Kenneth Hulet, one of the co-discovers.&lt;ref name=vanderkrogt/&gt; However, [[IUPAC]] resolved in August 1994 that an element could not be named after a living person, and Seaborg was still alive at the time. Thus, in September 1994, IUPAC recommended a set of names in which the names proposed by the three laboratories (the third being the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]]) with competing claims to the discovery for elements 104 to [[meitnerium|109]] were shifted to various other elements, in which ''rutherfordium'' (Rf), the Berkeley proposal for element 104, was shifted to element 106, with ''seaborgium'' being dropped entirely as a name.&lt;ref name=transuranium/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

This decision ignited a firestorm of worldwide protest for disregarding the historic discoverer's right to name new elements, and against the new retroactive rule against naming elements after living persons; the American Chemical Society stood firmly behind the name ''seaborgium'' for element 106, together with all the other American and German naming proposals for elements 104 to 109, approving these names for its journals in defiance of IUPAC.&lt;ref name=transuranium/&gt; At first, IUPAC defended itself, with an American member of its committee writing: "Discoverers don't have a right to name an element. They have a right to suggest a name. And, of course, we didn't infringe on that at all." However, Seaborg responded:

{{quotation|This would be the first time in history that the acknowledged and uncontested discoverers of an element are denied the privilege of naming it.&lt;ref name=vanderkrogt/&gt;|author=Glenn Seaborg}}

Bowing to public pressure, IUPAC proposed a different compromise in August 1995, in which the name ''seaborgium'' was reinstated for element 106 in exchange for the removal of all but one of the other American proposals, which met an even worse response. Finally, IUPAC rescinded these previous compromises and made a final, new recommendation in August 1997, in which the American and German proposals for elements 104 to 109 were all adopted, including ''seaborgium'' for element 106, with the single exception of element 105, named ''dubnium'' to recognise the contributions of the Dubna team to the experimental procedures of transactinide synthesis. This list was finally accepted by the American Chemical Society, which wrote:&lt;ref name=transuranium/&gt;

{{quotation|In the interest of international harmony, the Committee reluctantly accepted the name 'dubnium' for element 105 in place of 'hahnium' [the American proposal], which has had long-standing use in literature. We are pleased to note that 'seaborgium' is now the internationally approved name for element 106.&lt;ref name=transuranium/&gt;|author=American Chemical Society}}

Seaborg commented regarding the naming:

{{quotation|I am, needless to say, proud that U.S. chemists recommended that element 106, which is placed under tungsten (74), be called 'seaborgium.' I was looking forward to the day when chemical investigators will refer to such compounds as seaborgous chloride, seaborgic nitrate, and perhaps, sodium seaborgate.&lt;br&gt;This is the greatest honor ever bestowed upon me—even better, I think, than winning the Nobel Prize.{{efn|Seaborg had in fact previously won the 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] together with [[Edwin McMillan]] for "their discoveries in the chemistry of the first transuranium elements".&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1951 |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1951/index.html |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Future students of chemistry, in learning about the periodic table, may have reason to ask why the element was named for me, and thereby learn more about my work.&lt;ref name=vanderkrogt/&gt;|author=Glenn Seaborg}}

Seaborg died a year and a half later, on 25 February 1999, at the age of 86.&lt;ref name=vanderkrogt/&gt;

[[Super-heavy element]]s such as seaborgium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in [[particle accelerator]]s that induces [[fusion reaction]]s. Whereas most of the isotopes of seaborgium can be synthesized directly this way, some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher [[atomic number]]s.&lt;ref name=fusion&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barber |first1=Robert C. |last2=Gäggeler |first2=Heinz W. |last3=Karol |first3=Paul J. |last4=Nakahara |first4=Hiromichi |last5=Vardaci |first5=Emanuele |last6=Vogt |first6=Erich |title=Discovery of the element with atomic number 112 (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=81 |issue=7 |page=1331 |year=2009 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-08-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the energies involved, fusion reactions that generate superheavy elements are separated into "hot" and "cold". In hot fusion reactions, very light, high-energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets ([[actinide]]s), giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40–50&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]]) that may either fission or evaporate several (3 to 5) neutrons.&lt;ref name=fusion/&gt; In cold fusion reactions, the produced fused nuclei have a relatively low excitation energy (~10–20&amp;nbsp;MeV), which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions. As the fused nuclei cool to the [[ground state]], they require emission of only one or two neutrons, and thus, allows for the generation of more neutron-rich products.&lt;ref name=AM89&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Peter |last=Armbruster |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Gottfried |last2=Munzenberg |title=Creating superheavy elements |journal=Scientific American |volume=34 |pages=36–42 |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is a distinct concept from that of where nuclear fusion claimed to be achieved at room temperature conditions (see [[cold fusion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0728(89)80006-3 |title=Electrochemically induced nuclear fusion of deuterium |year=1989 |last1=Fleischmann |first1=Martin |last2=Pons |first2=Stanley |journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry and Interfacial Electrochemistry |volume=261 |issue=2 |pages=301–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seaborgium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes of seaborgium have been reported with atomic masses 258–267, 269, and 271, three of which, seaborgium-261, 263, and 265, have known [[metastable state]]s. All of these decay only through alpha decay and spontaneous fission, with the single exception of seaborgium-261 that can also undergo [[electron capture]] to dubnium-261.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;

There is a trend toward increasing half-lives for the heavier isotopes; thus the heaviest three known isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Sg, &lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;Sg, and &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Sg, are also the longest-lived, having half-lives in minutes. Some other isotopes in this region are predicted to have comparable or even longer half-lives, with the longest-lived predicted isotope being &lt;sup&gt;272&lt;/sup&gt;Sg which is expected to have a half-life of about an hour. Additionally, &lt;sup&gt;263&lt;/sup&gt;Sg, &lt;sup&gt;265&lt;/sup&gt;Sg, &lt;sup&gt;265m&lt;/sup&gt;Sg, as well as the predicted &lt;sup&gt;268&lt;/sup&gt;Sg have or should have half-lives measured in seconds. All the remaining isotopes have half-lives measured in milliseconds, with the exception of the shortest-lived isotope, &lt;sup&gt;261m&lt;/sup&gt;Sg, with a half-life of only 92&amp;nbsp;microseconds.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;

The proton-rich isotopes from &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Sg to &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Sg were directly produced by cold fusion; all heavier isotopes were produced from the repeated alpha decay of the heavier elements [[hassium]], [[darmstadtium]], and [[flerovium]], with the exceptions of the isotopes &lt;sup&gt;263m&lt;/sup&gt;Sg, &lt;sup&gt;264&lt;/sup&gt;Sg, &lt;sup&gt;265&lt;/sup&gt;Sg, and &lt;sup&gt;265m&lt;/sup&gt;Sg, which were directly produced by hot fusion through irradiation of actinide targets. The twelve isotopes of seaborgium have half-lives ranging from 92&amp;nbsp;microseconds for &lt;sup&gt;261m&lt;/sup&gt;Sg to 3.1&amp;nbsp;minutes for &lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;Sg.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;

==Properties==
===Physical===
Seaborgium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, similar to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] tungsten.&lt;ref name=bcc/&gt; It should be a very heavy metal with a [[density]] of around 35.0&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which would be the fourth-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower only than [[bohrium]] (37.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), [[meitnerium]] (37.4&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[hassium]] (41&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the three following elements in the periodic table.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, [[osmium]], has a density of only 22.61&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This results from seaborgium's high atomic weight, the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], and [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], although production of enough seaborgium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

===Chemical===
Seaborgium is the fourth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of [[group 6 element|group 6]] in the periodic table, below [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], and [[tungsten]]. All the members of the group form a diversity of oxoanions. They readily portray their group oxidation state of +6, although this is highly oxidising in the case of chromium, and this state becomes more and more stable to reduction as the group is descended: indeed, tungsten is the last of the 5d transition metals where all four 5d electrons participate in [[metallic bonding]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|pages=1002–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, seaborgium should have +6 as its most stable oxidation state, both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution, and this is the only oxidation state that is experimentally known for it; the +5 and +4 states should be less stable and the +3 state, the most common for chromium, would be the least stable for seaborgium.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; Experimental chemical investigation has been hampered due to the need to produce seaborgium one atom at a time, its short half-life, and the resulting necessary harshness of the experimental conditions.&lt;ref name=carbonyl&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1255720| pmid = 25237098| title = Synthesis and detection of a seaborgium carbonyl complex| journal = Science| volume = 345| issue = 6203| pages = 1491–3| year = 2014| last1 = Even | first1 = J.| last2 = Yakushev | first2 = A.| last3 = Dullmann | first3 = C.

This stabilisation of the highest oxidation state occurs in the early 6d elements because of the similarity between the energies of the 6d and 7s orbitals, since the 7s orbitals are relativistically stabilised and the 6d orbitals are relativistically destabilised. This effect is so large in the seventh period that seaborgium is expected to lose its 6d electrons before its 7s electrons (Sg, [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;6d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Sg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;6d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Sg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;6d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; Sg&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;6d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; Sg&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;, [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;). Because of the great destabilisation of the 7s orbital, Sg&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; should be even more unstable than W&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; and should be very readily oxidised to Sg&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;. The predicted ionic radius of the hexacoordinate Sg&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is 65&amp;nbsp;pm, while the predicted atomic radius of seaborgium is 128&amp;nbsp;pm. Nevertheless, the stability of the highest oxidation state is still expected to decrease as Lr&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; Rf&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; Db&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; Sg&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;.

Seaborgium should form a very volatile [[hexafluoride]] (SgF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) as well as a moderately volatile hexachloride (SgCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), pentachloride (SgCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), and oxychlorides SgO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SgOCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; SgO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is expected to be the most stable of the seaborgium oxychlorides and to be the least volatile of the group 6 oxychlorides, with the sequence MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; WO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; SgO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

The volatile seaborgium(VI) compounds SgCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and SgOCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are expected to be unstable to decomposition to seaborgium(V) compounds at high temperatures, analogous to MoCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and MoOCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; this should not happen for SgO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to the much higher energy gap between the [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied]] and lowest unoccupied [[molecular orbital]]s, despite the similar Sg–Cl bond strengths (similarly to molybdenum and tungsten).&lt;ref name="Kratz"&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1351/pac200375010103 |url =https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/pac.2003.75.issue-1/pac200375010103/pac200375010103.pdf |title = Critical evaluation of the chemical properties of the transactinide elements (IUPAC Technical Report) |date = 2003 |last1 = Kratz |first1 = J.

The adsorption properties of the resulting oxychloride were measured and compared with those of molybdenum and tungsten compounds. The results indicated that seaborgium formed a volatile oxychloride akin to those of the other group 6 elements, and confirmed the decreasing trend of oxychloride volatility down group 6:

:Sg + {{chem|O|2}} + 2 HCl → {{chem|SgO|2|Cl|2}} + {{chem|H|2}}

In 2001, a team continued the study of the gas phase chemistry of seaborgium by reacting the element with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O environment. In a manner similar to the formation of the oxychloride, the results of the experiment indicated the formation of seaborgium oxide hydroxide, a reaction well known among the lighter group 6 homologues as well as the pseudohomologue [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Molybdenum and tungsten are very similar to each other and show important differences to the smaller chromium, and seaborgium is expected to follow the chemistry of tungsten and molybdenum quite closely, forming an even greater variety of oxoanions, the simplest among them being seaborgate, {{chem|Sg|O|4|2-}}, which would form from the rapid hydrolysis of {{chem|Sg(H|2|O)|6|6+}}, although this would take place less readily than with molybdenum and tungsten as expected from seaborgium's greater size. Seaborgium should hydrolyse less readily than tungsten in [[hydrofluoric acid]] at low concentrations, but more readily at high concentrations, also forming complexes such as SgO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and {{chem|SgOF|5|-}}: complex formation competes with hydrolysis in hydrofluoric acid.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; These predictions have largely been confirmed. In experiments conducted in 1997 and 1998, seaborgium was eluted from cation-exchange resin using a HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/HF solution, most likely as neutral SgO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or the anionic complex ion [SgO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; rather than {{chem|SgO|4|2-}}. In contrast, in 0.1 M [[nitric acid]], seaborgium does not elute, unlike molybdenum and tungsten, indicating that the hydrolysis of [Sg(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; only proceeds as far as the cationic complex [Sg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or [Sg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, while that of molybdenum and tungsten proceeds to neutral [MO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)].&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

The only other oxidation state known for seaborgium other than the group oxidation state of +6 is the zero oxidation state. Similarly to its three lighter congeners, forming [[chromium hexacarbonyl]], [[molybdenum hexacarbonyl]], and [[tungsten hexacarbonyl]], seaborgium has been shown in 2014 to also form seaborgium [[metal carbonyl|hexacarbonyl]], Sg(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Like its molybdenum and tungsten homologues, seaborgium hexacarbonyl is a volatile compound that reacts readily with [[silicon dioxide]].&lt;ref name=carbonyl/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">In discussing [[solar energy]], the '''solar savings fraction''' or '''solar fraction''' (f) is the amount of energy provided by the solar technology divided by the total energy required.

The solar savings fraction thus is zero for no solar energy utilization, to 1.0 for all energy provided by solar.  The solar savings fraction of a particular system is dependent on many factors such as the load, the collection and storage sizes, the operation, and the climate.  As an example, the same solar-thermal water heating system installed in a single-family house in Arizona might have f=0.75 (75%), while in a much colder and cloudier climate, like Pittsburgh, PA, might only have a solar fraction of f=0.3 (30%) or so.  Great care is thus needed in designing such systems, and in evaluating their economics.

To increase the solar savings fraction, [[energy conservation]] measures should be employed first before expanding the size of the solar energy collection system.  Doing so reduces the need for hot water or space heating, for example, and typically provides the best economic return on the total investment, including the solar energy system.

A '''static synchronous series compensator''' or '''SSSC''' is a kind of [[flexible AC transmission system]], which consists of a solid-state [[voltage source inverter]] coupled with a [[transformer]] that is connected in series with a [[transmission Line]]. This device could inject an almost sinusoidal [[voltage]] in series with the line. This injected voltage could be considered as an inductive or capacitive [[Electrical reactance|reactance]], which is connected in series with the transmission line.&lt;ref name="IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine"&gt;{{cite web | title=SSSC-static synchronous series compensator: theory, modeling, and application | website=IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel4/61/14462/00660884.pdf | access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature can provide controllable voltage compensation.&lt;ref name="IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Static Synchronous Series Compensator: A Solid-State Approach to the Series Compensation of Transmission Lines | website=IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine | date=2017-11-07 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel1/39/12227/00560708.pdf | access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, SSSC is able to reverse the power flow by injecting a sufficiently large series reactive compensating voltage.&lt;ref name="IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine 2017"/&gt;

There are many large '''stones of Scotland''' of cultural and historical interest, notably the distinctive [[Pictish stones]], but also the other types discussed below.
{{TOC right}}

==Stone of Scone==
The [[Stone of Scone]], (pronounced 'scoon') also commonly known as the "Stone of Destiny" or the "Coronation Stone", is a block of [[sandstone]] historically kept at the now-ruined [[abbey]] in [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]], near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland. It was used for centuries in the [[coronation]] of the [[monarchs of Scotland]], the [[monarchs of England]], and, more recently, [[British monarchs]].

==Rocking stones==
[[Ayrshire]] apparently is endowed with a geology that lends itself towards the formation of [[rocking stone]]s. There are several rocking stones, or stones that used to rock at one time, in Ayrshire, Scotland.

[[File:Coylton logan or rocking stone.jpg|left|thumb|210px|&lt;Center&gt;The Coylton rocking stone in 1863.]]
A rocking stone is recorded from near the site of Saint Bride's Chapel. This stone stands on top of the Craigs of Kyle near [[Coylton]] in Ayrshire. It weighs around 30 tons and rest upon two stones. A large standing stone known as Wallace's stone stands nearby.&lt;ref name="Paterson"&gt;[[James Paterson (journalist)|Paterson, James]] (1863). ''History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton.'' Vol. I. – Kyle. Pub. James Stillie, Edinburgh. P. 217 – 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a rocking stone near Loch Riecawr in [[South Ayrshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=242500&amp;y=592500&amp;z=3&amp;sv=Rock&amp;st=3&amp;tl=Rocking+Stone,+South+Ayrshire+&amp;searchp=newsearch.srf&amp;mapp=newmap.srf A map showing the location of a rocking stone in South Ayrshire]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the parish of [[Carrick, Scotland|North Carrick]] in the [[Straiton|Straiton District]] in South Ayrshire, 
about a quarter of a mile to the west of the White Laise, and near the March Dyke, there is a rocking stone named the Logan Stone. The Logan Stone is a grey granite rock and rests on greywacke, and can easily be moved with one hand. It is 4 feet 3&amp;nbsp;inches by 4 feet, by 3 feet high.&lt;ref&gt;''Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire'', John Smith of Dalry, 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

A rocking stone that some associate with the [[Druid]]s is on Cuff Hill in [[Hessilhead]], near [[Beith]] in [[North Ayrshire]]. It no longer rocks due to people digging beneath to ascertain its fulcrum.&lt;ref&gt;''Topographical Description of Ayrshire; more Particularly of Cunninghame: together with a Genealogical account of the Principal families in that Bailiwick.'', George Robertson, Cunninghame Press, Irvine, 1820&lt;/ref&gt; It is in a small wood and surrounded by a circular drystone wall. An article was published in Cumnock Chronical of 1907 on the reason for the stone being dislodged. Signed by a Messer's Robert Boyle &amp; Robert Currie.

The Lamagee or Lamargle stone is in the centre of a stone circle in the village of [[Lugar, East Ayrshire|Lugar]] in [[East Ayrshire]]. The Lamargle stone rests on two stones. Local legend has it that the Lamargle stone used to rock, but it no longer does.

[[File:Lugar rocking stone.jpg|right|thumb|200px|&lt;Center&gt;The Lugar rocking stone.]] 
[[File:Sannox, Arran rocking stone.jpg|left|thumb|200px|&lt;Center&gt;The Sannox rocking stone.]]
Near Lugar in the Parish of Auchinleck in Ayrshire, Scotland is a rocking stone in a hollow by the Bella Water near its junction with the Glenmore Water. It is made of two vertical stones, and a horizontal stone about six feet long, three feet broad and four feet high. It was regarded as a [[Druid]]ical monument or the grave of a Caledonian hero.&lt;ref name="Currie"&gt;Currie, Robert. ''Rocking stone near Lugar.'' Kilmarncok Glenfield Ramblers Society. Annals. 1904 – 1907. P. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

A rocking stone existed in 1913 – 1919 at Sannox on Arran. It sat on a nearly horizontal platform next to the seashore.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;Allen, Charles A. ''Arran: Its Charm &amp; Beauty.'' Kilmarncok Glenfield Ramblers Society. Annals. 1904 – 1907. facing P. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clochoderick stone near [[Howwood]] and [[Kilbarchan]] in Renfrewshire used to rock and it is said that the Druids used it to judge people. The accused was made to sit on the stone and by the way it moved the Druids judged the innocence or guilt of the individual. It is also said to be the burial place of [[Rhydderch Hael]], King of Strathclyde who was the victor at the Battle of Arderydd near Arthuret in the Borders. His victory brought Christianity to Strathclyde.

===Views of the Cuff Hill rocking stone===
This stone could still, with a little effort, be rocked in the 1860s according to the historian John Smith.&lt;ref&gt;''Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire'', John Smith of Dalry, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lochmaben stone==
The megalith known as the [[Lochmaben Stone]] was called the Lochmabonstone in a well-known book by Logan Mack in 1926. This stone has, in the Borders context, an unsurpassed extent of history attached to it. It stands in a field, nearly a mile west of the Sark mouth on the Solway Firth, three hundred yards or so above high-water mark on the farm of Old Graitney in Dumfries &amp; Galloway, Scotland. Map reference: NY 3123 6600. The area is also known as Stormont.

The stone is an erratic, 7' high and 18' in girth and weighs approximately ten tons. It is composed of weathered granite, exposed to severe glacial action.

==Thurgartstone==
{{main article|Thurgartstone}}
The Ogrestone or Thurgartstone near [[Corsehill, Lainshaw, Robertland and Dunlop|Dunlop]] in [[East Ayrshire]] is thought to have been a [[rocking stone]]. However, soil has built up around the base of the Thurgatstone over the years, which now prevents any rocking motion.

The Thurgatstane / Thorgatstane / Field Spirit Stane / Ogrestane near Dunlop in East Ayrshire is a [[glacial erratic]] stone near the middle of a field belonging to Brandleside Farm near to the site of St.Mary's Chapel on the [[Lugton]] road.

==The Carlin or Hag's Stone==
{{main article|Carlin stone}}
[[File:Carlinstone.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A view of the Carlin Stone]]
On top of the Common Crags overlooking [[Dunlop, East Ayrshire|Dunlop]] and the Glazert is a large procumbent boulder known as the 'Carlin's Stone or Stane'. This stone is not as well known as the Thorgatstane. A Carl is a commoner, a husband or in a derogatory sense, a churl or person of low birth. Carlin is the Scots equivalent of Gaelic "Cailleach", meaning a witch or the 'old Hag', goddess of Winter. This would therefore be the Witch's Stone, one of several in Scotland with this name.

Near 'Kirkhill' outside Stewarton are several Kilbrides. [[Bride]], [[Brigit]] or St. Brigid was originally a Celtic Goddess linked with the festival of [[Imbolc]], the eve of the first of February. She was the goddess of Spring and was associated with healing and sacred wells, therefore the antithesis of the Carlin. Carlin's Tooth is the name of a rock outcrop in the Scottish borders between Knocks Knowe and Carter Fell (Logan Mack 1926). Several Carling Farms are to be found near [[Darvel]] in Ayrshire.

== The Stone of Mannau ==
[[File:Clackmannanstane.jpg|left|thumb|100px|The Mercat cross &amp; Stone of Manau at the 'Tolbooth' in Clackmannan. 2005.]]
Clackmannan (from the Gaelic Clach Mhanainn, 'Stone of Manau') is the name of a small town and local government district in the Central region of Scotland, corresponding to the traditional county of Clackmannanshire, which was Scotland's smallest. The 'Stone of Manau or Manaw' is a [[monolith]] of religious significance to the ancient tribes of the area. It has been moved from its original position and placed in the town centre on top of a large standing stone, which was quarried locally.

===The Dagon Stone===
The RCHAMS 'Canmore' site lists this unhewn [[olivine]] [[monolith]] in Darvel, Ayrshire, as a 'possible' standing stone. It is rather curious and its general size and shape suggest a prehistoric standing stone. It has twelve small connected depressions spread over three of its sides. These have been said to link the stone to astronomical observations and to the noon-day sun height at mid-summer. This would link the stone to life-giving powers, fertility and prosperity.&lt;ref name="McLeod"&gt;McLeod, Alex. G. (Editor), ''The Book of Old Darvel and Some of its Famous Sons.'' Pub. Walker &amp; Connell, Darvel. P. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821 someone attached a round sandstone ball to the top of it with an iron bar. Who or why is unknown. It is 1.6m tall and its original position is also unknown. It used to stand in what is now the main street, at the end of Ranoldcoup Road as shown by an old photograph,&lt;ref name="McLeod4"&gt;McLeod, Alex. G. (Editor), ''The Book of Old Darvel and Some of its Famous Sons.'' Pub. Walker &amp; Connell, Darvel. P. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and was moved to the town square when the road was widened.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS"&gt;[http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/pls/portal/newcanmore.newcandig_details_gis?inumlink=43642 RCAHMS Canmore site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentation shows that prior to the 19th century messings-about, newlywed couples and their wedding parties marched around it for good luck, accompanied by a fiddler.&lt;ref name="McLeod4"/&gt; Wedding processions also used to walk three times sunwise round the Dagon stone on the way to the bride's house.&lt;ref name="McLeod6"&gt;McLeod, Alex. G. (Editor), ''The Book of Old Darvel and Some of its Famous Sons.'' Pub. Walker &amp; Connell, Darvel. P. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual parade or "Prawd", originally held on old New Year's Day, headed by the village band used to walk sunwise round the Dagon stone as a mark of superstitious respect.&lt;ref name="McLeod6"/&gt;

[[Dagon]] is the name of a Philistine god, who was half-man half-fish. But with a Scottish accent it no doubt derives from something much closer to home (assuming it is not just the romantic invention of a Victorian antiquary). It is reminiscent of the [[Clackmannan]] stone or Stone of Mannau in [[Clackmannanshire]].

== The Dooslan stone ==
[[File:Dooslan stone paisley.JPG|right|thumb|200px|&lt;Center&gt;The Doosland Stone and the remains of the lettering inscribed on its surface.]]
[[File:Dooslan stone in Brodie Park, paisley.JPG|left|200px|thumb|&lt;Center&gt;The Dooslan stone and the tolbooth bases in Brodie Park.]]
This glacial erratic stone now lies in Brodie Park in Paisley. It is thought to have been named after a Mr Dove who laid claim to the stone. Originally to be found at the corner of Neilston Road and Rowan Street in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], the stone was the meeting place of the Weavers Union in the South of Paisley and was also used as a "soapbox". It was later moved to its present location in Brodie Park. The stone is still used today as the meeting point for the annual Sma' Shots parade.&lt;ref name="Dooslann"&gt;[http://www.paisleyonline.co.uk/html/parks.html Paisley Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its ancient significance is unknown, but it has played a significant role in historical times and has probably always been a megalith of social significance.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===The Carlin Stone at Craigends===

A large procumbent boulder known on the OS map as the 'Carlin's Stone' lies next to the Carlin Burn near Craigends Farm below Cameron's Moss in East Ayrshire. The name is the same as the example at [[Corsehill|Dunlop]] in East Ayrshire. It has been much visited at one time, with the clear remains of a footbridge running to it across the [[River Irvine|Hareshawmuir Water]].

===The Deil's Chuckie Stane at Ladyland===

[[File:Devil's Chuckie Stone Ladyland.JPG|right|200px|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The Deil's Chuckie Stane near Ladyland House.]]
A large boulder in amongst trees near the David Hamilton designed Ladyland House, [[Kilbirnie]], North Ayrshire. Despite the name no clear legend has been preserved regarding this stone in the neighbourhood. The stone has survived being broken up despite the building of the old Ladyland Castle, stone dykes, farm buildings, etc.

===The Grannie stane at Irvine in Ayrshire===

The [[Grannie stone|Grannie Stane]] (or Granny Stane) is described as "one of Irvine's prehistoric puzzles", this boulder is either left behind from the Ice Age or is the last remaining stone of a stone circle – others were removed, by blasting, after the Irvine weir was constructed in 1895, but popular protests saved this remaining stone. The Grannie Stane is visible when the water is low.

===The Hare stone===
[[File:The Monkton Hare Stone, Ayrshire.JPG|thumb|200px|The Hare Stone]]
The Muckle or Hare stone is a glacial erratic boulder previously located in a nearby field and moved to the centre of Monkton, near [[Prestwick]], in 2000. A number of tales of witchcraft and evil spirits are associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;Love, Dane (2003), Ayrshire : Discovering a County. Ayr : Fort Publishing. {{ISBN|0-9544461-1-9}}. Page 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Gowk Stane===
[[File:Gowk Stane Darvel Ayrshire.JPG|thumb|200px|The [[Gowk Stone|Gowk Stane]].]]
Near Laigh Overmuir on the moors above [[Darvel]] in East Ayrshire is the Gowk Stane, a glacial erratic boulder located in a prominent position overlooking the upper tributaries of the Glen Water.

===The Haylie Chambered Tomb===
[[File:Haylie Cairn.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Haylie Chambered Tomb]]
In [[Largs]], North Ayrshire resides a [[neolithic]] tomb behind Douglas Park. This monument is known as the Haylie Chambered Tomb and it was once covered by a cairn of stones (known as Margaret's Law). When it was uncovered in the early twentieth century the tomb was dated to around 3000 to 2000 BC.

===Cup and ring mark stone===
The purpose of [[cup and ring mark]]ed stones is unknown, however they may represent family trees, star maps, br related to [[labyrinth]]s, etc.&lt;ref name="Bord"&gt;Bord, Janet and Colin. (1973) ''Mysterious Britain''. Pub. Garnstone. {{ISBN|0-85511-180-1}}. P. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;Morris, Ronald W B (I967-68). '"The Cup-and-Ring Marks and Similar Sculptured of Scotland: a Survey of the Southern Counties, Part II." ''Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scot.'', Vol.100. P.47.&lt;/ref&gt; The carvings on such stones date from the [[Neolithic]] or [[Bronze age]] times, being as old as 6000 years. This example from Dalgarven Mill in Ayrshire is unusual in having cups and connecting troughs, but no rings and it may therefore have been abandoned at an early stage in its use. Often up to five concentric rings are found circling the central cup.

'''Sugar quartz''' is a [[gemstone]] with a natural surface texture much like fine sugar crystals formed by natural phenomena of micro-crystalline facets.

Sugar quartz has a history going back 10,000 years, as referenced in Paleo-Indian. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meadwildlife.org/index.php/mead-area-history/paleo-indians/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sugar quartz was referenced three different times in [https://play.google.com/books/reader?printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;id=fKoPAAAAIAAJ the United States Geological Survey by Joseph Hyde Pratt in "The Occurrence and Distribution of Corundum in the United States – by Joseph Hyde Pratt", published in 1901 on page 650] &lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/books/reader?printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;id=fKoPAAAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

"A few of the smaller caverns only, near the surface, could be seen. These were lined with crumbling, rust-colored, oxidized ore, beneath which there was often unaltered galena. '''Sometimes''' these caves are lined and partly filled with '''a light, porous, pumiceous sponge of quartz'''. This is not the cellular, honeycombed quartz resulting from the removal of ore by oxidizing waters, but is '''an original spongy crystallization of minute quartz crystals''', with some interstitial kaolin. It forms a light friable mass that is strongly suggestive of pumice. It is '''analogous to the "sugar quartz" occurring in vugs, with sericite,''' in some of the gold- quartz veins of California, although not to the "sugar quartz" which results from a crushing of the vein." - Joseph Hyde Pratt

Sugar quartz has not been seen or found much since the early 1900s. Any findings in present day are considered extremely rare.

It was referenced seven times in [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=psA_AQAAMAAJ The Mining Investor: Volumes 48-49- '''January 1, 1907''' Critic Publishing Company- Publisher]
on page 794 stating "The ores discovered are invariably free milling, occurring in sugar quartz, sometimes heavily 0‘ E: stained with iron. as is the case with the Grot- &lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=psA_AQAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent known legal publication referencing sugar quartz, a total of 13 times, is [https://play.google.com/books/reader?printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;id=m8o-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PP10 Mining and Treatment of Feldspar and Kaolin in the Southern Appalachian Region – Arthur Simeon Watts, published '''First edition, 7“ June, 1913.'''], including in the Table of Contents referring to sugar quartz being on page 163.&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/books/reader?printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;id=m8o-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PA5&lt;/ref&gt;

Page 58 of the same book refers to sugar quartz is "The sugar quartz is therefore the only pure silica present in commercial quantity''' in the region investigated. When pure its refractory value is cone 34 (1,810° C.). With the small amount of impurity present its deformation point or refractory value is about cone 32 or 33, that is, 1,780° C." &lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/books/reader?printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;id=m8o-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PP10&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other Native American Arrowheads made out of sugar quartz have been found as referenced in [http://www.arrowheadology.com/forums/arrowheads-indian-artifacts/35152-sugar-quartz-fluted-point.html www.ArrowHeadOlogy.com], [http://lithiccastinglab.com/gallery-pages/2001novemberhixton.htm Lithicasting Lab] and [http://www.wheretofindarrowheads.com/Sugar_Quartz_Points.php Where to Find Arrow Heads]

The '''Taralga Wind Farm''' is a [[wind farm]] located near [[Taralga, New South Wales]].

Taralga Wind Farm was CBD Energy/Santander's first and only wind farm. It is a 106.8&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]] wind farm with 51&amp;nbsp;[[wind turbines|turbines]].  The energy produced by the wind farm can power around 45,000 average Australian households per year, saving over 258,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au/media/40762/cefc_factsheet_taralgawind_lr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

The Taralga Wind Farm is near [[Taralga, New South Wales|Taralga]].

==Timeline==
On 20 February 2012, approval was granted by the [[New South Wales Government]] for work to commence on the Taralga Wind Farm, after the approval of the Stage 1 CEMP. The project consists of 51 wind turbines generating 106.8 Megawatts of electricity on ridges to the east of Taralga. Electricity generated by the project will be fed into the national power grid through a 37.5&amp;nbsp;km transmission line to Marulan Substation.

The project created up to 200 local jobs during the construction phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taralga-windfarm.com.au/|title=Taralga Wind Farm|publisher=Renewable Energy Systems Ltd|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approval of the wind farm followed an unsuccessful challenge by the Taralga Landscape Guardians in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales to block the project on the grounds of aesthetic and environmental impacts including noise emissions and blighting of the landscape. Chief Justice Brian Preston ruled in favour of approving the wind farm as the long term benefit of reduced greenhouse gas emissions was in the greater public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/peel_climatechange/2008/12/16/taralga-landscape-guardians-case-2007/|author=Peel, Jacqueline|title=Taralga Landscape Guardians case (2007)|publisher=[[University of Melbourne]]|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2015, the wind farm was fully commissioned and commenced commercial operations. The layout of the wind farm can be seen through this [https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=z-8dPkqwkOY0.kRfyZL-yH1xE link].

On March 2015, the Chinese state-owned utility State Power Investment Corp agreed to purchase the Wind Farm for a reported A$300&amp;nbsp;million, which includes the A$200&amp;nbsp;million debt facility from the CBD Energy (now BlueNRGY) and Banco Santander subsidiary Capital Riesgo joint venture.&lt;ref&gt;http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/china-state-firm-buys-taralga-wind-farm-as-banco-santander-exits-72059&lt;/ref&gt; The project is currently operated under an O&amp;M contract with Vestas Australia, and has Wind Prospect CWP as asset Managers.&lt;ref&gt;http://cwprenewables.com.au/asset-management/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
To help fund the construction of the wind farm, CBD Energy/Santander signed a A$200&amp;nbsp;million project finance debt facility agreement with [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ]], [[Clean Energy Finance Corporation|CEFC]], and EKF.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au/media/40762/cefc_factsheet_taralgawind_lr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The project had off-take backing from [[EnergyAustralia]]
The total project cost was A$280&amp;nbsp;million.

The '''therm''' (symbol, '''thm''') is a non-[[International System of Units|SI]] [[Units of energy|unit]] of [[heat]] [[energy]] equal to {{val|100000}}{{nbsp}}[[British thermal unit]]s (Btu&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std 260.1-2004&lt;/ref&gt;). It is approximately the energy equivalent of burning {{convert|100|cuft|m3|abbr=off|2}} – often referred to as 1 CCF – of [[natural gas]].

Since natural gas meters measure volume and not energy content, a '''therm factor''' is used by natural gas companies to convert the volume of gas used to its heat equivalent, and thus calculate the actual energy use. The therm factor is usually expressed in units of therms per CCF. It will vary with the mix of hydrocarbons in the natural gas. Natural gas with a higher than average concentration of [[ethane]], [[propane]] or [[butane]] will have a higher therm factor. Impurities, such as [[carbon dioxide]] or [[nitrogen]], lower the therm factor.

The volume of the gas is calculated as if measured at [[standard temperature and pressure]] (STP). The heat content of natural gas is solely dependent on the composition of the gas, and is independent of temperature and pressure.

One therm is equal to about {{val|105.5}}{{nbsp}}[[joule|megajoules]], {{val|25200}}{{nbsp}}[[kilocalories]], or {{val|29.3}}{{nbsp}}[[kilowatt-hours]]. One therm can also be provided by about {{convert|96.7|cuft|m3}} of natural gas. The therm sometimes has been confused with the [[thermie]]. The names of both units come from the Greek word for heat.

10 therms are known as a [[decatherm]] (sometimes, dekatherm;&lt;ref name=dekatherm/&gt; commonly abbreviated Dth), which is {{val|1000000}}{{nbsp}}Btu (of whichever type). Further common abbreviations are MDth for a {{val|1000}} decatherms, and MMDth for {{val|1000000}} decatherms.&lt;ref name=dekatherm&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1978/01/22/gas-utilities-stepping-up-efforts-to-add-customers/e72a9dbd-4d32-4e7f-80b8-d3b61f02db67/ |title=Gas Utilities Stepping Up Efforts to Add Customers |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=22 January 1978  |author=Jerry Knight |accessdate= 1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in reference|date=June 2017}}

==Usage==
United Kingdom regulations were amended to replace therms with joules with effect from 1999, with natural gas usually retailed in the derived unit, kilowatt-hours. Despite this, the wholesale UK gas market trades in therms. In the United States, natural gas is commonly billed in CCFs (hundreds of cubic feet) or therms.

==Carbon footprint==
According to the [[EPA]] burning one therm of natural gas produces on average {{convert|5.3|kg|abbr=on|1}} of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references epa.gov "Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator - Calculations and References'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The metric tonne is derived from the weight of pure water; there are 1,000 litres in one metric tonne.

==Symbol and abbreviations==
The [[International System of Units|SI]] symbol for the tonne is "t", adopted at the same time as the unit in 1879.&lt;ref name=bippy/&gt; Its use is also official for the metric ton in the United States, having been adopted by the United States [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].&lt;ref name=fedreg/&gt; It is a symbol, not an abbreviation, and should not be followed by a [[period (punctuation)|period]].

==Origin and spelling==
In French and all English-speaking countries that are predominantly metric, ''tonne'' is the correct spelling. It is usually pronounced the same as ton {{IPAc-en|t|ʌ|n}}, but when it is important to clarify that the metric term is meant, rather than short ton, the final "e" can also be pronounced, i.e. "tonny" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ʌ|n|ɪ}}.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford English dictionary 2nd ed. lists both /tʌn/ and /ˈtʌnɪ/&lt;/ref&gt;  In Australia, it is also pronounced {{IPAc-en|t|ɒ|n}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink= |title= Macquarie Dictionary|edition= fifth |url= |accessdate= |year= 2009|publisher= Macquarie Dictionary Publishers Pty Ltd|location= Sydney|isbn= |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[Metrication in the United Kingdom|metrication in the UK]] the unit used for most purposes was the Imperial ton of 2,240&amp;nbsp;[[Pound avoirdupois|pounds avoirdupois]] or 20 [[hundredweight]] (usually referred to as the [[long ton]] in the US), equivalent to 1,016&amp;nbsp;kg, differing by just 1.6% from the tonne. The UK [[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)#20th century|Weights and Measures Act 1985]] explicitly excluded from use for trade certain imperial units, including the ton, unless the item being sold or the weighing equipment being used was weighed or certified prior to 1 December 1980, and even then only if the buyer was made aware that the weight of the item was measured in imperial units.&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Weights, Measures, and Units, edited by Donald Fenna, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act| title = Weights and Measures Act 1985| type = Act| number = 72| language = English| date = 30 October 1985| article = 8(1)| article-type= Section| url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/72| access-date = 11 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act| title = Weights and Measures Act 1985| type = Act| number = 72| language = English| date = 30 October 1985| article = 11(13 - 14)| article-type= Schedule| url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/72| access-date = 11 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States ''metric ton'' is the name for this unit used and recommended by NIST;&lt;ref name="fedreg"&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/63fr40333.pdf Metric System of Measurement: Interpretation of the International System of Units for the United States] (PDF). See corrections in the Errata section of [http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/nist-interpretation.html].&lt;/ref&gt; an unqualified mention of a ''ton'' almost invariably refers to a [[short ton]] of {{convert|2000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, and ''tonne'' is rarely used in speech or writing.

''Ton'' and ''tonne'' are both derived from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word in general use in the [[North Sea]] area since the [[Middle Ages]] (cf. [[Old English]] and [[Old Frisian]] ''tunne'', [[Old High German]] and [[Medieval Latin]] ''tunna'', [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]] ''tonne'') to designate a large cask, or ''tun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|tonne}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full tun, standing about a metre high, could easily weigh a tonne. An English [[Tun (unit)|tun]] (an old wine cask volume measurement equivalent to 954 litres) of wine weighs roughly a tonne, 954&amp;nbsp;kg if full of water, a little less for wine.

The spelling ''tonne'' pre-dates the introduction of the SI in 1960; it has been used with this meaning in France since 1842,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/tlfiv4/showps.exe?p=combi.htm;java=no;|title=Recherche d'un mot|website=atilf.atilf.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; when there were no metric prefixes for multiples of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and above, and is now used as the standard spelling for the metric mass measurement in most [[English language|English]]-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Derived units==
For multiples of the tonne, it is more usual to speak of thousands or millions of tonnes. Kilotonne, megatonne, and gigatonne are more usually used for the energy of nuclear explosions and other events in [[TNT equivalent|equivalent mass of TNT]], often loosely as approximate figures.  When used in this context, there is little need to distinguish between metric and other tons, and the unit is spelt either as ''ton'' or ''tonne'' with the relevant prefix attached.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed. gives both megaton and megatonne and adds "The unit may be calculated in either imperial or metric tons; the form megatonne generally implies the metric unit". The use for energy is the first definition; use for mass or weight is the third definition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative usage==
A '''[[metric ton unit]]''' (mtu) can mean {{convert|10|kg|lbs|sigfig=2}} within metal (e.g. tungsten, manganese) trading, particularly within the US. It traditionally referred to a metric ton of ore containing 1% (i.e. 10&amp;nbsp;kg) of metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emis.platts.com/thezone/guides/platts/metals/conversion.html|title=Platt's Metals Guide to Specifications - Conversion Tables|date=8 September 2008|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908055702/http://www.emis.platts.com/thezone/guides/platts/metals/conversion.html|archivedate=8 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictM.html How Many?

The following excerpt from a mining geology textbook describes its usage in the particular case of tungsten:
&lt;blockquote style="font-size:100%"&gt; 
"Tungsten concentrates are usually traded in metric tonne units (originally designating one tonne of ore containing 1% of WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, today used to measure WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; quantities in 10 kg units. One metric tonne unit (mtu) of tungsten (VI) contains 7.93 kilograms of tungsten." (Walter L Pohl, ''Economic Geology: Principles and Practices'', English edition, 2011, p 183.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Note that tungsten is also known as wolfram and has the atomic symbol W.

In the case of [[uranium]], the acronym ''MTU'' is sometimes considered to be ''metric ton of uranium'', meaning  1,000&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/rwmp-3/REFERENCE.pdf Reference.Pdf].

A gigatonne of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] (GtCO2eq) is a unit used by the UN climate change panel, [[IPCC]], to measure the effect of a technology or process on [[global warming]].

===Use of mass as proxy for energy===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Impact event]] --&gt;
{{Main article|TNT equivalent}}
The ''tonne of [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT)'' is used as a proxy for energy, usually of explosions (TNT is a common [[high explosive]]). Prefixes are used: kiloton(ne), megaton(ne), gigaton(ne), especially for expressing [[nuclear weapon yield]], based on a [[Fuel value|specific combustion energy]] of TNT of about 4.2&amp;#160;[[megajoule|MJ]]/[[kilogram|kg]] (or one [[calorie|thermochemical calorie]] per [[milligram]]).  Hence, 1 t TNT = 4.2&amp;#160;[[Gigajoule|GJ]], 1 [[kiloton|kt]] TNT = 4.2&amp;#160;[[Terajoule|TJ]], 1&amp;#160;Mt TNT = 4.2&amp;#160;[[Petajoule|PJ]].

The SI unit of energy is the [[joule]]. Assuming that a TNT explosion releases 1,000 small (thermochemical) [[calorie]]s per gram (4.2&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|kJ]]/g), one tonne of TNT is equivalent to 4.2 [[Joule|gigajoules]].

In the [[petroleum industry]] the [[tonne of oil equivalent]] (toe) is a [[units of energy|unit of energy]]: the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of [[crude oil]], approximately 42&amp;nbsp;GJ.  There are several slightly different definitions.  This is ten times as much as a tonne of TNT because atmospheric oxygen is used.

===Unit of force===
Like the [[gram]] and the kilogram, the tonne gave rise to a (now obsolete) force unit of the same name, the tonne-force, equivalent to about 9.8 kilonewtons: a unit also often called simply "tonne" or "metric ton" without identifying it as a unit of force.  In contrast to the tonne as a mass unit, the tonne-force or metric ton-force is not acceptable for use with SI, partly because it is not an exact multiple of the SI unit of force, the [[newton (unit)|newton]].

[[Image:Douglas Tornado.jpg|upright=1.7|right|thumb|A tornado in [[Douglas, Oklahoma]], May 24, 2008.]]
A '''tornado warning''' ([[Specific Area Message Encoding|SAME]] code: TOR) is an alert issued by national weather forecasting agencies to warn the public that [[thunderstorm|severe thunderstorms]] with [[tornado]]es are imminent or occurring. It can be issued after a tornado, [[funnel cloud]] and [[Wall cloud|rotation in the clouds]] has been spotted by the public, [[Storm chasing|storm chasers]], [[emergency management]] or [[law enforcement]].

When this happens, the [[civil defense siren|tornado siren]]s may sound in that area if any sirens are present, informing people that a tornado has been sighted or may be forming nearby (because sirens are generally not heard indoors, residents should not completely depend on them). The issuance of a tornado warning indicates that residents should take immediate safety precautions.

It is a higher level of alert than a [[tornado watch]], but (in the United States) it can be surpassed by an even higher alert known as a [[tornado emergency]] or [[Particularly Dangerous Situation]] warning.

==Early history==
The first official tornado forecast – and tornado warning – was made by [[United States Air Force]] Capt. (later Col.) [[Robert C. Miller]] and Major Ernest Fawbush, on March 25, 1948. The first such forecast came after the events that transpired five days earlier on March 20, 1948; Miller – a [[California]] native who became stationed at [[Tinker Air Force Base]] three weeks earlier – was assigned to work the late shift as a forecaster for the base's Air Weather Service office that evening, analyzing [[National Weather Service|U.S. Weather Bureau]] surface maps and upper-air charts that failed to note atmospheric instability and moisture content present over [[Oklahoma]] that would be suitable for producing thunderstorm activity, erroneously forecasting dry conditions for that night. Thunderstorms soon developed southwest of [[Oklahoma City]], and at 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., forecasters from [[Will Rogers World Airport|Will Rogers Airport]] sent a warning to Tinker that the storm encroaching the city was producing wind gusts of {{convert|92|mph|kph}} and a "Tornado South on Ground Moving NE!" Base personnel received an alert written by the Staff Sarg. on duty with Miller, minutes before the twister struck Tinker several minutes later around 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., damaging several military aircraft (with total damage estimated at $10 million) that could not be secured in time before it crossed the base grounds.&lt;ref name="stormwarning1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Storm Warning: The Story of a Killer Tornado|author=Nancy Mathis|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster|Touchstone]]|pages=41–43|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7432-8053-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an inquiry the next day before a tribunal of five generals who traveled to Tinker from [[Washington, D.C.]], who ruled that the March 20 tornado was an "act of God[..] not forecastable given the present state of the art", base commander Gen. Fred Borum tasked Miller and Fawbush to follow up on the board's suggestion to consider methods of forecasting tornadic thunderstorms. Over the next three days, Miller and Fawbush studied reports and charts from previous tornado events to determine the atmospheric conditions favorable for the development of tornadic activity, in an effort to predict such events with some degree of accuracy. At the time, there had not been studies on how tornadoes formed; however, military radars were being adapted for forecasting use, allowing forecasters to see the outlines of storms but not their internal attributes such as rotation. Miller and Fawbush's findings on atmospheric phenomenon present in past outbreaks would aid in their initial forecast, as the day's surface and upper-air analysis charts determined the same conditions present on March 20 were present on the 25th, concluded that central Oklahoma would have the highest risk for tornadoes during the late-afternoon and evening.&lt;ref name="stormwarning1"/&gt;

Borum, who had put together a severe weather safety plan for base personnel, then suggested that Miller and Fawbush issue a severe thunderstorm forecast, and then asked the men if they would issue a tornado forecast based on the similarities between the conditions that produced the tornado which hit the base five days earlier, which they were reluctant to do. Fawbush wrote the forecast message that Miller would type and issued it to base operations at 2:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. as thunderstorms were approaching from [[North Texas]]. Defying the high odds of two tornadoes hitting the same area in five days, one hit the Tinker campus around 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., to the surprise of Miller (who left the base an hour earlier, believing their forecast would not pan out), who found out about the storm (produced by two thunderstorms that merged to the southwest of Tinker) via a radio report. Miller and Fawbush would not put out another tornado forecast until March 25, 1949, when they successfully predicted tornadic activity would occur in southeastern Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="stormwarning1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stormwarning2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Storm Warning: The Story of a Killer Tornado|author=Nancy Mathis|publisher=Touchstone|pages=44–47|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7432-8053-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller and Fawbush soon would distribute their tornado forecasts to the [[American Red Cross]] and [[Oklahoma Highway Patrol]], after giving William Maughan, chief meteorologist at the U.S. Weather Bureau's Oklahoma City office (who provided them with additional archived weather data to help fine-tune their forecasts), permission to relay their forecasts to those agencies. The relative accuracy of the forecasts restarted a debate over their reliability and whether military or civilian agencies should have jurisdiction over the issuance of weather warnings.&lt;ref name="stormwarning2"/&gt; The USAF had pioneered tornado forecasting and tornado warnings, although John P. Finley had developed the first experimental tornado forecasts in 1885, before he and other officials with the agency were prohibited by the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|United States Signal Service]]'s weather service from using the word "tornado" in forecasts two years later, directing Finley to instead reference "severe local storms", a move motivated by concerns by businessmen in the [[Great Plains]] that Finley's forecasts would hurt economic development if potential investors believed their areas were tornado-prone. This position on tornado forecasting would be shared with the U.S. Weather Bureau after it was formation in 1890, fearing that it would incite panic among the public if tornadoes were predicted to occur; the side effect of this was that the lack of warning resulted in a steady increase in the number of tornado-related fatalities through the 1950s, with some events prior to 1948 (such as the deadliest tornado in U.S. history, the [[Tri-State Tornado]] in March 1925, and the [[1947 Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornadoes|Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornadoes]] in April 1947) having death tolls that exceeded well over 100.&lt;ref name="stormwarning3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Storm Warning: The Story of a Killer Tornado|author=Nancy Mathis|publisher=Touchstone|pages=47–53|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7432-8053-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the Weather Bureau rescinded its ban on the usage of the word "tornado" in weather products disseminated to emergency management personnel. The Bureau would develop a network of volunteer storm spotters in the early 1940s during [[World War II]], to provide warning of tornadoes to workers in munitions plants and strategic factories.&lt;ref name="stormwarning3"/&gt; The ban on issuing tornado warnings to the general public would not be revoked until Chief of Bureau Francis W. Reichelderfer officially lifted the ban in a Circular Letter issued on July 12, 1950 to all first order stations: "Weather Bureau employees should avoid statements that can be interpreted as a negation of the Bureau's willingness or ability to make tornado forecasts", and that a "good probability of verification" exist when issuing such forecasts due to the difficulty in accurately predicting tornadic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Online Tornado FAQ|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#Forecasting|author=[[Roger Edwards (meteorologist)|Roger Edwards]]|publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Meteorological Society]] agreed to have Miller and Fawbush present their methodology for forecasting tornadoes during the organization's 1950 meeting in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]; after garnering press coverage for their successful prediction of past tornadoes, AMS representatives decided to open the presentation to the public.&lt;ref name="stormwarning3"/&gt;

The Air Force began issuing severe weather forecasts relayed to Weather Bureau offices and emergency personnel in tornado-prone regions through the formation of the Severe Weather Warning Center in 1951, before the Bureau's contention that the USAF intruded on its responsibility to relay such forecasts led to the SWWC limiting the release of its tornado forecasts to military personnel; however, the move to prohibit the USAF from widespread releasing of tornado forecasts led to disapproval and heavy criticism from Oklahoma media outlets, given the agency's continued refusal to provide public tornado warnings. The Weather Bureau issued its first experimental public tornado forecast in March 1952, which proved inaccurate and was released too late to become widely available for public consumption; however, a forecast issued the following evening managed to predict an outbreak of tornadoes across most of the warned seven-state area (from [[Texas]] to [[Indiana]]).&lt;ref name="stormwarning3"/&gt;

Even after the U.S. Weather Bureau lifted their ban on tornado warnings, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] continued to ban television and radio outlets from broadcasting tornado warnings on-air for the same reasoning cited in the Bureau's abolished ban. Broadcast media followed this ban until 1954, when meteorologist [[Harry Volkman]] broadcast the first televised tornado warning over WKY-TV (now [[KFOR-TV]]) in [[Oklahoma City]], due to his belief that the banning of tornado warnings over broadcast media cost lives. Through an alert issued by the USAF Severe Weather Warning Center, Volkman opted to interrupt regular programming to warn viewers of a reported tornado approaching the Oklahoma City area; although station management and U.S. Weather Bureau officials were displeased with his move, WKY-TV received numerous telephone calls and letters thanking Volkman for the warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tulsa TV Weather|url=http://tulsatvmemories.com/weather.html|website=Tulsa TV Memories|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The History (and Future) of Tornado Warning Dissemination in the United States|url= http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2010BAMS3062.1|author=Timothy A.

==Tornado alert==
For many years until the early 1980s, an intermediate type of tornado advisory known as a tornado alert was defined by the [[National Weather Service]] and issued by the agency's local forecast offices, indicating that tornado formation was imminent. In theory, tornado alerts covered situations such as visible rotation in clouds and certain other phenomena which are portents of funnel cloud formation. The National Weather Service's use of this advisory began to decline after 1974, although it was still listed on public information materials issued by various media outlets, local NWS offices and other entities for another decade or so.

The criteria which called for tornado alerts in the past now generally result in a tornado warning with clarifying verbiage specifying that the warning was issued because rotation was detected in one way or another, that a [[wall cloud]] has formed or a tornado has been spotted or detected. The preferred response to both the tornado alerts and warnings is to take shelter immediately, so distinguishing them could be seen as splitting hairs, especially since storm prediction methods have improved.

The tornado alert was finally eliminated outright because it was made largely obsolete by the advent of [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]], which can detect rotational funnel cloud formations earlier than is typically possible by trained spotters and members of the public. With fewer false-positives, radar also helped reduce public confusion over storm types, strengths and precise locations. The last tornado alert to be officially issued was discussed in earnest following the [[1974 Super Outbreak]].

==Tornado emergency==
{{Main|Tornado emergency}}
The National Weather Service has the option of issuing a [[tornado emergency]], a severe weather statement with unofficial, enhanced wording that is disseminated when a large, extremely violent tornado is about to impact a densely populated area. This category of weather statement is the highest and most urgent level relating to tornadoes, albeit an unofficial alert product. The first tornado emergency was declared on May 3, 1999, when an [[1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado|F5 tornado]] struck southern portions of the [[Oklahoma City]] metropolitan area, causing major damage exceeding $1 billion. In some cases, such as an F3 tornado that struck the [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]] metropolitan area on September 20, 2002, a tornado emergency has been declared within the initial issuance of the tornado warning. Not all confirmed tornadoes will be considered a "tornado emergency", and such statements are commonly declared when it is believed that the tornado is at a severity in which it would cause a significant threat to life and property.

The levels of severity increase as follows:
#[[Convective Outlook]] mentioning tornado potential
#[[Public Severe Weather Outlook]] mentioning tornado potential
#[[Tornado watch|Tornado Watch]]
#[[Particularly Dangerous Situation]] Tornado Watch
#Tornado Warning
#Particularly Dangerous Situation Tornado Warning (used by Weather Forecast Offices within the National Weather Service Central Region Headquarters as an intermediate warning in the event that a tornado has been spotted or confirmed, or a significant tornado is expected)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='CATASTROPHIC': Experimental Tornado Warnings to be Explicit|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/catastrophic-and-unsurvivable/63553|website=[[AccuWeather]]|publisher=AccuWeather, Inc.|date=April 5, 2012|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Tornado emergency|Tornado Emergency]]

Tornado warnings can also be intensified by added wording mentioning that the storm is life-threatening, that it is an extremely dangerous situation, that a large, violent and/or destructive tornado is on the ground or is capable of causing significant property damage.

==Criteria==
A tornado warning is issued when any of the following conditions has occurred:
* a tornado is reported on the ground, or
* a funnel cloud has been reported, or
* [[Wall cloud|strong low-level rotation]] is indicated by [[weather radar]],&lt;ref name="Definition"/&gt; or
* a [[waterspout]] is headed for [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]].&lt;ref name="Definition"/&gt;

A ''tornado warning'' means there is immediate danger for the warned area and immediate surrounding locations – if not from the relatively narrow tornado itself, from the severe thunderstorm producing (or likely to produce) it. Those in the path of such a storm are urged to take cover immediately, as it is a life-threatening situation. A warning is different from a [[tornado watch]] (issued in the [[United States]] by a national guidance center, the [[Storm Prediction Center]]) which only indicates that conditions are favorable for the formation of tornadoes.

Generally (but not always), a tornado warning also indicates that the potential is there for severe [[downburst|straight-line winds]] and/or large [[hail]] (in the United States, winds exceeding {{convert|58|mph|kph}} and/or hail larger than {{convert|1|in|cm}} are the respective defined criteria to classify such phenomena as severe; the criteria varies in other countries) from the thunderstorm.&lt;ref name="Example2"/&gt; A [[severe thunderstorm warning]] can be upgraded suddenly to a tornado warning should conditions warrant.&lt;ref name="Example2"/&gt;

In the United States, local offices of the [[National Weather Service]] outline warnings for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in [[polygon]]al shapes for map-based weather hazard products, which are used to delineate sections of a [[County (United States)|county]], [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]] or other jurisdiction that the warning covers (which are also referenced in NWS text warning products by the specified sections of the affected jurisdictions), based on the projected path of a storm as determined by Doppler radar at the time of the warning's issuance; however, entire counties/parishes are sometimes included in the warning polygon, especially if they encompass a small geographical area. Prior to October 2007, warnings were issued by the National Weather Service on a per-county basis.&lt;ref name="Storm-based"/&gt; Storm Prediction Center and National Weather Service products as well as [[First Warning|severe weather alert displays]] used by some television stations highlight tornado warnings with a red polygon or filled county/parish outline.

In [[Canada]], similar criteria are used and warnings are issued by regional offices of the [[Meteorological Service of Canada]] branch of [[Environment Canada]] in [[Vancouver]], [[Edmonton]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; (in the province of [[Ontario]], Emergency Management Ontario recently{{when|date=October 2015}} began issuing red alerts for areas of the province that are already under an Environment Canada-issued tornado warning; these red alerts sometimes override the tornado warning if local government or media are participating in the program).

Tornado warnings are generated via the Advance Weather Interactive Processing System ([[AWIPS]]) and then disseminated through various communication routes accessed by the media and various agencies, on the internet, to [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] satellites, and on [[NOAA Weather Radio]].&lt;ref name="Dissemination"/&gt; [[Civil defense siren|Tornado siren]]s are also usually activated for the affected areas if present (the actual areas where sirens are activated may vary depending on the relay structure of a given jurisdiction's siren network, with some municipalities activating all sirens within their network even in areas not referenced as being included in the warning). Local police or fire departments may dispatch crews not assigned to an existing emergency call to travel within a designated area to warn residents to take tornado safety precautions if sirens are disabled due to technical problems or are not present, while [[Auto dialer|automated phone calls]] may be made to residents for the same purpose in some areas should such disruptions occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Severe Weather Awareness Week |url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mpx/?n=swaw |author=National Weather Service Twin Cities, MN |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |date=April 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uzwPG3io?url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mpx/?n=swaw |archivedate=December 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, if it is deemed necessary, the National Weather Service has the option of requesting activation of the [[Emergency Alert System]] to interrupt television and radio broadcasts to get the bulletin out quickly.

Advances in technology, both in identifying conditions and in distributing warnings effectively, have been credited with reducing the death toll from tornadoes. The average warning times have increased substantially from -10 to -15 minutes in 1974 to about 15 minutes {{as of|2013|lc=}} (in some cases, the lead time can extend to more than an hour's warning of impending tornadoes). In the United States, the tornado death rate has declined from 1.8 deaths per million people per year in 1925 to only 0.11 per million in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tornado Warnings Infographic|url=http://mattcuttsalerts.com/tornado-warnings/|website=Matt Cutt's Alerts|accessdate=July 18, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716172215/http://mattcuttsalerts.com/tornado-warnings/|archivedate=July 16, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this change is credited to improvements in the tornado warning system, via the various advances in the detection of severe local storms, along with an increase in reports visually confirming severe weather activity via storm spotters, public officials and citizens.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Ground truthing==
The [[SKYWARN]] program, which trains citizens on how to spot tornadoes, funnel clouds, wall clouds, and other severe weather phenomena, is offered by the National Weather Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SKYWARN|url=http://www.ict-skywarn.org/|website=[[SKYWARN]]|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used in tandem with Doppler radar information, eyewitness reports can be very helpful for warning the public of an impending tornado, especially when used for [[ground truth]]ing.&lt;ref name="Groundtruth3"/&gt;

Other spotter groups such as the [[Amateur Radio Emergency Service]], news media, local [[law enforcement agencies]]/[[emergency management]] organizations, [[National Weather Service#Surface observations|cooperative observers]], and the general public also relay information to the National Weather Service for ground truthing.&lt;ref name="Groundtruth4"/&gt;

A '''transmission tower''' or '''power tower''' ('''electricity pylon''' or '''electric pylon''' in the United Kingdom, Canada and parts of Europe) is a tall [[structure]], usually a steel [[lattice tower]], used to support an [[overhead power line]].

They are used in high-voltage AC and DC systems, and come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Typical height ranges from {{convert|15|to|55|m|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=IFC&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/66b56e00488657eeb36af36a6515bb18/Final%2B-%2BElectric%2BTransmission%2Band%2BDistribution.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;id=1323162154847|title=Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines for Electric Power Transmission and Distribution|format=PDF|publisher=International Finance Corporation|date=2007-04-30|page=21|accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the tallest are the {{convert|370|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} towers of a {{convert|2700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} span of [[Zhoushan Island Overhead Powerline Tie]]. In addition to steel, other materials may be used, including concrete and wood.

There are four major categories of transmission towers:&lt;ref name=IFC /&gt; [[suspension tower|suspension]], [[terminal tower|terminal]], [[Dead-end tower|tension]], and [[transposition tower|transposition]]. Some transmission towers combine these basic functions. Transmission towers and their overhead power lines are often considered to be a form of [[visual pollution]]. Methods to reduce the visual effect include [[undergrounding]].

== Naming ==

[[File:NBPowerTransmissionTowerMaintenance.JPG|thumb|A line worker working on a tower]]

"Transmission tower" is the name for the structure used in the industry in the United States, and some other English-speaking countries. The term "pylon" comes from the basic shape of the structure, an obelisk-like structure which tapers toward the top, and the name is mostly used in the United Kingdom and parts of Europe in everyday colloquial speech. This term is used infrequently in the United States, as the word "pylon" is commonly used for many other things, mostly for [[traffic cone]]s.

== High voltage AC transmission towers ==

[[File:Electricity pylon DSCI0402.jpg|thumb|upright|Single-circuit three-phase transmission line]]

[[Three-phase electric power]] systems are used for high voltage (66- or 69-kV and above) and extra-high voltage (110- or 115-kV and above; most often 138- or 230-kV and above in contemporary systems) [[Alternating current|AC]] transmission lines. The towers must be designed to carry three (or multiples of three) conductors. The towers are usually steel lattices or [[truss]]es (wooden structures are used in Canada, Germany, and [[Scandinavia]] in some cases) and the insulators are either glass or porcelain discs or composite insulators using silicone rubber or [[EPDM rubber]] material assembled in strings or long rods whose lengths are dependent on the line voltage and environmental conditions.

Typically, one or two [[Ground wire (transmission line)|ground wires]], also called "guard" wires, are placed on top to intercept lightning and harmlessly divert it to ground.

Towers for high- and extra-high voltage are usually designed to carry two or more electric circuits (with very rare exceptions, only one circuit for 500-kV and higher).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} If a line is constructed using towers designed to carry several circuits, it is not necessary to install all the circuits at the time of construction. Indeed, for economic reasons, some transmission lines are designed for three (or four) circuits, but only two (or three) circuits are initially installed.

Some high voltage circuits are often erected on the same tower as 110 kV lines. Paralleling circuits of 380 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV-lines on the same towers is common. Sometimes, especially with 110 kV circuits, a parallel circuit carries traction lines for [[railway electrification]].

== High voltage DC transmission towers ==

[[File:HVDC Distance Pylon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|HVDC distance tower near the terminus of the [[Nelson River Bipole]] adjacent to Dorsey Converter Station near [[Rosser, Manitoba]], Canada — August 2005]]

[[High-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) transmission lines are either [[High-voltage direct current#Monopole and earth return|monopolar]] or [[High-voltage direct current#Bipolar|bipolar]] systems. With bipolar systems, a conductor arrangement with one conductor on each side of the tower is used. On some schemes, the ground conductor is used as [[electrode line]] or ground return. In this case, it had to be installed with insulators equipped with surge arrestors on the pylons in order to prevent electrochemical corrosion of the pylons. For single-pole HVDC transmission with ground return, towers with only one conductor can be used. In many cases, however, the towers are designed for later conversion to a two-pole system. In these cases, often conductors on both sides of the tower are installed for mechanical reasons. Until the second pole is needed, it is either used as electrode line or joined in parallel with the pole in use. In the latter case, the line from the converter station to the earthing (grounding) electrode is built as underground cable, as overhead line on a separate right of way or by using the ground conductors.

Electrode line towers are used in some HVDC schemes to carry the power line from the converter station to the grounding electrode. They are similar to structures used for lines with voltages of 10–30 kV, but normally carry only one or two conductors.

== Railway traction line towers ==

[[File:BSTROM1.jpg|thumb|upright|Tension tower with phase transposition of a powerline for single-phase AC traction current (110 kV, 16.67 Hz) near [[Bartholomä]], Germany]]

Towers used for single-phase AC [[railway]] [[overhead lines|traction lines]] are similar in construction to those towers used for 110 kV three-phase lines.  Steel tube or concrete poles are also often used for these lines. However, railway traction current systems are two-pole AC systems, so traction lines are designed for two conductors (or multiples of two, usually four, eight, or twelve). As a rule, the towers of railway traction lines carry two electric circuits, so they have four conductors. These are usually arranged on one level, whereby each circuit occupies one half of the cross arm. For four traction circuits, the arrangement of the conductors is in two-levels and for six electric circuits, the arrangement of the conductors is in three levels.

== Towers for different types of currents ==
[[File:Kraftledning 1918.jpg|thumb|175px|Pylon in Sweden about 1918.]]
{{refimprove section|date=April 2011}}

AC circuits of different frequency and phase-count, or AC and DC circuits, may be installed on the same tower. Usually all circuits of such lines have voltages of 50 kV and more. However, there are some lines of this type for lower voltages. For example, towers used by both railway traction power circuits and the general three-phase AC grid.

Two very short sections of line carry both AC and DC power circuits. One set of such towers is near the terminal of [[HVDC Volgograd-Donbass]] on Volga Hydroelectric Power Station. The other are two towers  south of Stenkullen, which carry one circuit of HVDC Konti-Skan and üne circuit of the three-phase AC line Stenkullen-Holmbakullen.

Towers carrying AC circuits and DC electrode lines exist in a section of the powerline between Adalph Static Inverter Plant and Brookston the pylons carry the electrode line of HVDC [[Square Butte (transmission line)|Square Butte]].

The electrode line of HVDC [[CU (Powerline)|CU]] at the converter station at Coal Creek Station uses on a short section the towers of two AC lines as support.

The overhead section of the [[electrode line]] of [[Pacific DC Intertie]] from Sylmar Converter Station to the grounding electrode in the Pacific Ocean near [[Will Rogers State Beach]] is also installed on AC pylons. It runs from Sylmar East Converter Station to Southern California Edison Malibu Substation, where the overhead line section ends.

In Germany, Austria and Switzerland some transmission towers carry both public AC grid circuits and railway traction power in order to better use rights of way.

=== Shape ===
[[File:Guyed Delta Transmission Tower.jpg|thumb|Guyed "Delta" transmission tower (a combination of guyed "V" and "Y") in [[Nevada]].]]

Different shapes of Transmission towers are typical for different countries. The Shape also depends on voltage and number of circuits.

====One circuit====
Delta pylons are the most common design for single circuit lines, because of their stability. They have a V-shaped body with a horizontal arm on the top, which forms an inverted [[Delta (letter)|Delta]]. Larger Delta Towers usually use two guard cables.

Portal pylons are widely used in Ireland, Scandianvia and Canada. They stand on two legs with one cross arm, which gaves them a H-shape. Up to 110 kV they often were made from wood, but higher voltage lines use steel pylons.

Smaller single circuit pylons may have two small cross arms on one side and one on the other.

====Two circuits====
One level pylons only have one cross arm carrying 3 cables on each side. Sometimes they have an additional cross arm for the protection cables. They are frequently used close to airports due to their reduced size.

[[File:ESA_Umspannwerk-Wehr_Bild2.jpg|thumb|Typical T-shaped 110 kV tower from the former [[GDR]].]]

Danube pylons or ''Donaumasten'' got their name from a line built in 1927 next to the [[Danube river]]. They are the most common design in central european countries like Germany or Poland. They have two cross arms, the upper arm carries one and the lower arm carries two cables on each side. Sometimes they have an additional cross arm for the protection cables.

Ton shaped towers are the most common design, they have 3 horizontal levels with one cable very close to the pylon on each side. In the United Kingdom the second level is wider than the other ones while in the United States all cross arms have the same width.

[[File:Electricity Wire Annotated.jpg|thumb|A close up of the wires attached to the pylon, showing the various parts annotated.]]

====Four circuits====
Christmas-tree-shaped towers for 4 or even 6 circuits are common in Germany and have 3 cross arms where the highest arm has each one cable, the second has two cables and the third has three cables on each side. The cables on the third arm usually carry circuits for lower high voltage.

=== Support structures ===
[[File:58730_Fr%C3%B6ndenberg,_Germany_-_panoramio_-_Foto_Fitti_(24).jpg|thumb|Danube pole for 110 kV in germany, built in the 1930s]]

Towers may be self-supporting and capable of resisting all forces due to conductor loads, unbalanced conductors, wind and ice in any direction. Such towers often have approximately square bases and usually four points of contact with the ground.

A semi-flexible tower is designed so that it can use overhead grounding wires to transfer mechanical load to adjacent structures, if a phase conductor breaks and the structure is subject to unbalanced loads. This type is useful at extra-high voltages, where phase conductors are bundled (two or more wires per phase). It is unlikely for all of them to break at once, barring a catastrophic crash or storm.

A [[guyed mast]] has a very small footprint and relies on guy wires in tension to support the structure and any unbalanced tension load from the conductors.  A guyed tower can be made in a V shape, which saves weight and cost.&lt;ref name=BEATY78 /&gt;

=== Materials ===

==== Tubular steel ====

[[File:New and old electricity pylons.jpg|thumb|upright|Steel tube tower next to older lattice tower near [[Wagga Wagga]], Australia]]

Poles made of tubular [[steel]] generally are assembled at the factory and placed on the right-of-way afterward. Because of its durability and ease of manufacturing and installation, many utilities in recent years prefer the use of monopolar steel or concrete towers over lattice steel for new power lines and tower replacements. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

[[Energy in Germany|In Germany]] steel tube pylons are also established predominantly for medium voltage lines, in addition, for high voltage transmission lines or two electric circuits for operating voltages by up to 110 kV. Steel tube pylons are also frequently used for 380 kV lines [[Energy in France|in France]], and for 500 kV lines [[Energy in the United States|in the United States]].

==== Lattice ====

{{See also|Lattice tower}}

A lattice tower is a framework construction made of steel or aluminium sections. Lattice towers are used for [[Overhead power line|power lines]] of all voltages, and are the most common type for high-voltage transmission lines. Lattice towers are usually made of galvanized steel. Aluminium is used for reduced weight, such as in mountainous areas where structures are placed by helicopter. Aluminium is also used in environments that would be corrosive to steel. The extra material cost of aluminium towers will be offset by lower installation cost. Design of aluminium lattice towers is similar to that for steel, but must take into account aluminium's lower [[Young's modulus]].

A lattice tower is usually assembled at the location where it is to be erected. This makes very tall towers possible, up to {{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (and in special cases even higher, as in the [[Elbe crossing 1]] and [[Elbe crossing 2]]). Assembly of lattice steel towers can be done using a [[crane (machine)|crane]]. Lattice steel towers are generally made of angle-profiled [[steel beam]]s ([[L-beam|L-]] or [[T-beam]]s). For very tall towers, [[truss]]es are often used.

==== Wood ====

[[File:Electric power transmission - Ljusdal.JPG|thumb|Wood and metal crossbar]]

[[Wood]] is a material which is limited in use in high-voltage transmission. Because of the limited height of available trees, the maximum height of wooden pylons is limited to approximately {{convert|30|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Wood is rarely used for lattice framework. Instead, they are used to build multi-pole structures, such as H-frame and K-frame structures. The voltages they carry are also limited, such as in other regions, where wood structures only carry voltages up to approximately 30 kV.

In countries such as Canada or the United States, wooden towers carry voltages up to 345 kV; these can be less costly than steel structures and take advantage of the surge voltage insulating properties of wood.&lt;ref name=BEATY78&gt;Donald Fink and Wayne Beaty  (ed.) ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Ed.'', Mc Graw Hill, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}}, pp. 14-102 and 14-103&lt;/ref&gt; {{Asof|2012}}, 345 kV lines on wood towers are still in use in the US and some are still being constructed on this technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spta.org/pdf/Reisdorff%20Lam%20%209-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainepower.com/winterport.htm|title=Winterport, Maine|author=Olive Development|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood can also be used for temporary structures while constructing a permanent replacement.

==== Concrete ====

[[File:Beton-Dreiebenenmast.jpg|thumb|A reinforced concrete pole in Germany]]

[[Concrete]] pylons are used in [[Germany]] normally only for lines with operating [[voltage]]s below 30 kV. In exceptional cases, concrete pylons are used also for 110 kV lines, as well as for the public grid or for the [[railway]] traction current grid. In Switzerland, concrete pylons with heights of up to 59.5 metres (world's tallest pylon of prefabricated concrete at [[Littau]]) are used for 380 kV overhead lines. Concrete poles are also used in Canada and the United States.

Concrete pylons, which are not prefabricated, are also used for constructions taller than 60 metres. One example is a {{convert|66|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall pylon of a 380 kV powerline near Reuter West Power Plant in Berlin. Such pylons look like industrial chimneys.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In China some pylons for lines crossing rivers were built of concrete. The tallest of these pylons belong to the Yangtze Powerline crossing at Nanjing with a height of {{convert|257|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

=== Special designs ===
Sometimes (in particular on steel lattice towers for the highest voltage levels) transmitting plants are installed, and antennas mounted on the top above or below the overhead [[Ground wire (transmission line)|ground wire]]. Usually these installations are for mobile phone services or the operating radio of the power supply firm, but occasionally also for other radio services, like directional radio. Thus transmitting antennas for low-power FM radio and television transmitters were already installed on pylons. On the [[Elbe Crossing 1]] tower, there is a radar facility belonging to the [[Hamburg]] water and navigation office.

For crossing broad valleys, a large distance between the conductors must be maintained to avoid short-circuits caused by conductor cables colliding during storms. To achieve this, sometimes a separate mast or tower is used for each conductor. For crossing wide rivers and straits with flat coastlines, very tall towers must be built due to the necessity of a large height clearance for navigation. Such towers and the conductors they carry must be equipped with flight safety lamps and reflectors.

Two well-known wide river crossings are the [[Elbe Crossing 1]] and [[Elbe Crossing 2]]. The latter has the tallest overhead line masts in Europe, at {{convert|227|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.  In Spain, the [[overhead line crossing]] pylons in the Spanish [[Pylons of Cadiz|bay of Cádiz]] have a particularly interesting construction. The main crossing towers are {{convert|158|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall with one crossarm atop a [[frustum]] framework construction. The longest overhead line spans are the crossing of the Norwegian Sognefjord ({{convert|4597|m|ft|abbr=on}} between two masts) and the [[Ameralik Span]] in Greenland ({{convert|5376|m|ft|abbr=on}}). In Germany, the overhead line of the EnBW AG crossing of the Eyachtal has the longest span in the country at {{convert|1444|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

In order to drop overhead lines into steep, deep valleys, inclined towers are occasionally used. These are utilized at the [[Hoover Dam]], located in the United States, to descend the cliff walls of the [[Black Canyon of the Colorado]]. In Switzerland, a NOK pylon{{Vague|a what?|date=November 2010}} inclined around 20 degrees to the vertical is located near [[Sargans]], [[St. Gallen (canton)|St. Gallens]]. Highly sloping masts are used on two 380 kV pylons in Switzerland, the top 32 meters of one of them being bent by 18 degrees to the vertical.

Power station chimneys are sometimes equipped with crossbars for fixing conductors of the outgoing lines. Because of possible problems with corrosion by flue gases, such constructions are very rare.

A new type of pylon will be used in the Netherlands starting in 2010. The pylons were designed as a minimalist structure by Dutch architects Zwarts and Jansma. The use of physical laws for the design made a reduction of the magnetic field possible. Also, the visual impact on the surrounding landscape is reduced.&lt;ref name=nethertowers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zwarts.jansma.nl/artefact-2410-en.html|title=New High Voltage Pylons for the Netherlands|accessdate=2010-04-24|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two clown-shaped pylons appear in Hungary, on both sides of the [[M5 motorway (Hungary) | M5 motorway]], near [[Újhartyán]]. ({{coord|47.2358442|N|19.3907302|E|type:landmark|name=Clown-shaped pylon}} &lt;ref name=clown&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orientpress.hu/portals/orientpress.hu/keptar/nagy/90675_bohoc.jpg|title=Clown-shaped High Voltage Pylons in Hungary}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Assembly ==

[[File:Pylon cable riggers dismantling reel.JPG|thumb|Cable riggers atop a pylon engaged in adding a fiber optic data cable wound around the top tower stay cable. The cable [[Optical attached cable|(SkyWrap)]] is wound on by a traveling machine, which rotates a cable drum around the support cable as it goes. This travels under its own power from tower to tower, where it is dismantled and hoisted across to the opposite side. In the picture, the motor unit has been moved across but the cable drum is still on the arrival side.]]

Before transmission towers are even erected, prototype towers are tested at [[tower testing station]]s. There are a variety of ways they can then be assembled and erected:
[[Image:Hochspannungsbehelfsmast.jpg|thumb|upright|Temporary guyed pylon next to a commenced new tower]]
* They can be assembled horizontally on the ground and erected by push-pull cable. This method is rarely used because of the large assembly area needed.
* They can be assembled vertically (in their final upright position). Very tall towers, such as the [[Yangtze River Crossing]], were assembled in this way.
* A [[jin-pole]] crane can be used to assemble lattice towers.&lt;ref name=BTTi&gt;{{cite web|author=Broadcast Tower Technologies|title=Gin Pole Services|url=http://www.tower-technologies.com/GinPole.htm|accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also used for [[utility pole]]s.
* [[Helicopter]]s can serve as [[aerial crane]]s for their assembly in areas with limited accessibility. Towers can also be assembled elsewhere and flown to their place on the transmission right-of-way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verticalmag.com/news/article/PoweringUp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004113042/http://www.verticalmag.com/news/article/PoweringUp |title=Powering Up – Vertical Magazine|archivedate=4 October 2015|work=verticalmag.com |accessdate=4 October 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Markers ==

[[File:Pylon Identification Tag.jpg|thumb|left|A typical tower identification tag]]

The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] issues recommendations on markers for towers and the [[Overhead power line#Conductors|conductors]] suspended between them. Certain jurisdictions will make these recommendations mandatory, for example that certain power lines must have [[overhead wire marker]]s placed at intervals, and that [[Aircraft warning lights|warning lights]] be placed on any sufficiently high towers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avaids.com/icao.pdf|title=Chapter 6. Visual aids for denoting obstacles|date=2004-11-25|work=Annex 14 Volume I Aerodrome design and operations|publisher=[[International Civil Aviation Organization]]|quote=6.2.8 ... spherical ... diameter of not less than 60&amp;nbsp;cm. ... 6.2.10 ... should be of one colour. ... Figure 6-2 ... 6.3.13|pages=6-3, 6-4, 6-5 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is particularly true of transmission towers which are in close vicinity to [[airport]]s.

Electricity pylons often have an identification tag marked with the name of the line (either the terminal points of the line or the internal designation of the power company) and the tower number. This makes identifying the location of a fault to the power company that owns the tower easier.

Transmission towers, much like other steel lattice towers including broadcasting or cellphone towers, are marked with signs which discourage public access due to the danger of the high voltage. Often this is accomplished with a sign warning of the high voltage. At other times, the entire access point to the transmission corridor is marked with a sign. Some countries require that lattice steel towers be equipped with a [[barbed wire]] barrier approximately {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground in order to deter unauthorized climbing. Such barriers can often be found on towers close to roads or other areas with easy public access, even where there is not a legal requirement. In the United Kingdom, all such towers are fitted with barbed wire.

== Tower functions ==

[[File:Channel Island NT.jpg|thumb|Three-phase alternating current transmission towers over water, near [[Darwin, Northern Territory]], Australia]]

Tower structures can be classified by the way in which they support the line conductors.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Civil Engineers ''Design of latticed steel transmission structures'' ASCE Standard 10-97, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7844-0324-4}}, section C2.3&lt;/ref&gt; Suspension structures support the conductor vertically using suspension insulators. Strain structures resist net tension in the conductors and the conductors attach to the structure through strain insulators. Dead-end structures support the full weight of the conductor and also all the tension in it, and also use strain insulators.

Structures are classified as tangent suspension, angle suspension, tangent strain, angle strain, tangent dead-end and angle dead-end.&lt;ref name=BEATY78 /&gt; Where the conductors are in a straight line, a tangent tower is used. Angle towers are used where a line must change direction.

=== Cross arms and conductor arrangement ===

Generally three conductors are required per AC 3-phase circuit, although single-phase and DC circuits are also carried on towers. Conductors may be arranged in one plane, or by use of several cross-arms may be arranged in a roughly symmetrical, triangulated pattern to balance the impedances of all three phases. If more than one circuit is required to be carried and the width of the line right-of-way does not permit multiple towers to be used, two or three circuits can be carried on the same tower using several levels of cross-arms. Often multiple circuits are the same voltage, but mixed voltages can be found on some structures.

== Notable electricity transmission towers ==

The following electricity transmission towers are notable due to their enormous height, unusual design, unusual construction site or their use in artworks.

[[File:Spb Freight trolley in 2nd depot at Arsenalnaya Street.jpg|thumb|Trolleytruck KTG-1 in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]]]
A '''trolleytruck''' (also known as a '''freight trolley''' or '''trolley truck'''&lt;ref name="hand_truck"&gt;In the United Kingdom a ''trolley'' may refer to the hand operated wheeled vehicle called a ''[[hand truck]]'' in North America. In North American usage the term ''trolley truck'' may also be used to refer to the wheelset or ''[[bogie]]'' that a streetcar rides upon.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[trolleybus]]-like vehicle used for carrying cargo instead of passengers. A trolleytruck is usually a type of [[electric truck]] powered by two [[overhead wires]], from which it draws [[electricity]] using two [[trolley pole]]s or two [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]]s.  Two [[current collector]]s are required in order to supply and return current, because the return current cannot pass to the [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] (as is done by [[streetcar]]s on [[Tramway track|rails]]&lt;ref name="pole"&gt;[[Tram]]s may collect current from a single wire with a single [[trolley pole]] or pantograph and return the current to [[Ground (electricity)|earth]] via the rail.&lt;/ref&gt;) since trolleytrucks use [[tire]]s that are [[Insulator (electrical)|insulators]].  Lower powered trucks, such as might be seen on the streets of a city, tend to use trolley poles for current collection. Higher powered trucks, such as those used for large construction or mining projects, may exceed the power capacity of trolley poles and have to use pantographs instead.&lt;ref name="siemens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w4.siemens.de/archiv/en/innovationen/industrie.html|title=Siemens History - Industry &amp; Automation|date=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hutnyak_history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hutnyak.com/Trolley/trolleyhistory.html|title=Trolley History|author=Dave Hutnyak|publisher=Hutnyak Consulting|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trolleytrucks have been used in various places around the world and are still in use in cities in [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]], as well as at mines in [[North America]] and [[Africa]]. Because they draw power from the mains, trolleytrucks can use [[renewable energy]] sources – modern trolleytrucks systems are under test in Sweden and Germany along highways using [[diesel-electric]] [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrids]] to reduce emissions.

==Use throughout the world==
===Austria===
Trolleytrucks were used in [[St. Lambrecht]], [[Austria]] by the [[AkzoNobel|Nobel Industries]] [[dynamite]] factory from 16 November 1945 to 21 April 1951.&lt;ref name="auer_info"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/person/dearmond/morph/Trolleytrucks.htm|title=Trolleytrucks|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trolleytrucks were used to carry dynamite over the [[Alps]] just after [[World War II]] due to the shortages of material that for a time prevented the use of diesel trucks.  In the 1950s the material shortages had been alleviated so the trolleytrucks were replaced with diesel trucks and the former power lines were taken down.  Some trucks from the abandoned line were reconverted to passenger trams and used along streets in [[Kapfenberg]].&lt;ref name="auer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/person/dearmond/morph/St_Lambrecht.ett.htm|title=St. Lambrecht Trolley-truck Line|author=Wolfgang Auer|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===
A Ukrainian built trolleytruck started service in [[Pleven]], [[Bulgaria]] in 1987, but that truck may no longer be in service since it is stored in the trolleybus depot.&lt;ref name="pleven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/pleven-trolley/factsaboutthetrolleys.htm
|title=Pleven and its trolleybus system - The trolleybuses of Pleven, Bulgaria
|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The [[Québec Cartier Mining Company]] used trolleytrucks in its [[iron]] [[ore]] mine in [[Québec]] from 1970 until 1977 when the iron ore deposit was exhausted and the mine closed down.  The power supply for this remote mine was a power plant taken out of a diesel electric railroad locomotive.&lt;ref name="hutnyak_history"/&gt;

===Germany===
The German [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety|Federal Ministry for the Environment]] is building a network of overhead wires along the [[autobahn]] for [[diesel-electric]] [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrids]], allowing trucks to cruise on electric power. A short test stretch has been built in [[Brandenburg]], with longer routes in [[Hesse]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]] planned for 2018.&lt;ref name="ElectroLKW"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hessenschau.de/wirtschaft/elektro-lkw-mit-oberleitung-rollen-bald-in-hessen,oberleitung-lkw-100.html|title=Elektro-Lkw mit Oberleitung rollen bald in Hessen|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017|publisher=[[Hessenschau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
Trolleytrucks were used by the AEM electric utility company of [[Milan]], [[Italy]] to supply construction materials and service to the San Giacomo Dam (constructed 1940-1950) and the second Cancano Dam (constructed 1952-1956).&lt;ref name="cancano"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2a.eu/gruppo/cms/a2a/en/about_us/impianti/idro/cancano.html |title=A2A - Cancano Dam |accessdate=2009-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211043727/http://www.a2a.eu/gruppo/cms/a2a/en/about_us/impianti/idro/cancano.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="san_giacomo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2a.eu/gruppo/cms/a2a/en/about_us/impianti/idro/san_giacomo.html |title=A2A - San Giacomo Dam |accessdate=2009-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211044000/http://www.a2a.eu/gruppo/cms/a2a/en/about_us/impianti/idro/san_giacomo.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2a.eu/gruppo/cms/a2a/en/about_us/storia/aem.html |title=A2A - AEM |accessdate=2009-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211044028/http://www.a2a.eu/gruppo/cms/a2a/en/about_us/storia/aem.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two trolleytruck lines in the [[Valtellina]] valley that helped to build then supply the dams
along the [[Spöl]] river were used from 1938 to 1962.&lt;ref name="hutnyak_history"/&gt;

===Namibia===
The [[Rössing Uranium Mine]] in [[Namibia]] installed a trolley assist system around 1986.&lt;ref name="hutnyak_history"/&gt;  The diesel electric drive [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]] 730E dump trucks were converted at that time to use trolley power assist for the climb out of the mine to the crusher.  The fleet numbered more than 10 vehicles as of 2001.&lt;ref name="hutnyak_history"/&gt;

===South Africa===
Trolleytrucks were introduced to the Palabora [[copper]] mine in [[South Africa]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="hutnyak_history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="palabora"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.palabora.co.za/|title=Palabora Mining Company|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mittal Steel South Africa|South African Iron and Steel Industrial Corporation (ISCOR)]] installed a {{convert|7.7|km|mi}} trolley power assist line
for {{convert|170|short ton|t}} diesel electric trucks at its Shishen mine in March 1982.&lt;ref name="hutnyak_history"/&gt; Afterwards the company also installed a trolley power assist system at its [[Grootegeluk coal mine]] in [[Lephalale]], South Africa.  ISCOR (now known as [[Mittal Steel South Africa]]) is the largest user of trolley power assist trolleytruck systems in the world.&lt;ref name="hutnyak_photo_iscor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hutnyak.com/Trolley/trolleyphotos.html#ISCOR%20Mining|title=ISCOR Mining, South Africa - 1982 to 2001|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union, Russia, Ukraine===
Many cities in the [[Soviet Union]] operated trolleytrucks. The [[Minsk Automobile Plant|MAZ]]-525 truck model was converted to a trolleytruck design in 1954 in [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]]. The Kharkiv experiment with trolleytrucks was stopped because of disadvantages.

Nowadays trolleytrucks operate in several cities in [[Ukraine]] such as [[Donetsk]] and [[Sevastopol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/person/dearmond/link/Sevastapol-TG104.JPG|title=Sevastapol-TG104.JPG|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as cities in [[Russia]] such as [[Bryansk]] and [[Saint Petersburg]].  One type, the KTG-1, is made for service and repair of the urban trolleybus vehicles; while another, the KTG-2, is used for transporting goods.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Sweden===
The first public electrified [[motorway]] opened in Sweden on 22 June 2016 on a stretch of [[European route E16]] near [[Gävle]], allowing hybrid and [[battery electric vehicle|battery electric]] [[Scania AB|Scania]] lorries to run from overhead wires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World’s first electric road opens in Sweden |url=https://www.scania.com/group/en/worlds-first-electric-road-opens-in-sweden/|publisher=Scania|date=22 June 2016|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
Trolleytrucks were used in [[Gümmenen]] and [[Mühleberg]] Switzerland between 1918 and 1922 during the construction of the dam that retains [[Lake Wohlen]]. The trucks were built by [[Tribelhorn]], and they used the Stoll system of current collection.

===United States===
Trolleytrucks have been used in mining operations and in road maintenance projects in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="kenworth_photo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/person/dearmond/morph/seattle2.jpg|title=Kenworth Trolleytruck in Seattle, Washington; May 1956|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Michigan====
From 1939 to 1964 the International Salt Company mine in [[River Rouge, Michigan]] used trolleytrucks that were converted [[Euclid Trucks|Euclid]] {{convert|20|short ton|t}} models.  This was an [[Underground mining (hard rock)|underground]] [[salt]] mine.  Batteries were used to power the trucks when they strayed away from the overhead wires.&lt;ref name="hutnyak_history"/&gt; For use within a mine the overhead wires may occasionally be relocated as excavation activity progresses.  Hence the trolleytrucks used in mines do not necessarily have a travel route that is as fixed as the trolleytruck routes used in cities.

====California====
From 1956 to 1971 the Riverside Cement Company in [[Bloomington, California]] operated [[Kenworth]] {{convert|30|short ton|t|adj=on}} [[dump truck]]s converted to trolleytruck use at the Crestmore Quarry near [[Riverside, California]].&lt;ref name="hutnyak_history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riverside"&gt;The Riverside Cement Company was sold to the [[SsangYong Group]] which then sold Riverside Cement to [[Texas Industries]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The trucks were equipped with "extension cords" for use of electric power near the shovel down in the mine.  The long extension cords stored on powered reels aboard the trolleytrucks offered them increased mobility right at the load point.

In 2015, a demonstration phase will start for an eHighway system in the area served by the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach. Initially, the eHighway will be a one-mile two-way stretch of road on the north- and south-bound sections of Alameda Street where it intersects with Sepulveda Boulevard in Carson, California. Construction of the system is expected to start immediately, and the first trucks should connect to the system in July 2015. When the trucks aren’t travelling the eHighway, they can run on diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), battery or other energy source. They are build by [[Mack Trucks]] in cooperation with [[Siemens]]. The demonstration phase is scheduled to last for one year. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.trucknews.com/transportation/california-gets-ehighway/1003058965&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Mexico====
The [[El Chino Mine]] near [[Santa Rita, New Mexico]] installed trolleytrucks in 1967.&lt;ref name="chino"&gt;Dave Hutnyak's "Trolley History" page mentions that [[Kennecott Utah Copper]] operated the "Chino" mine in New Mexico in the 1960s.  Note that the mine is now owned by [[Freeport-McMoRan]].&lt;/ref&gt; The trucks are equipped with diesel engines and the trolley power is used to assist the trucks up and down the ramp that leads into the mine.  This type of double power arrangement is known as a ''trolley assist'' system.&lt;ref name="hutnyak_assist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hutnyak.com/Trolley/trolleyoverview.html|title=Trolley Overview|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nevada====
{{see also|Gold mining in Nevada}}
[[Barrick Gold|Barrick]]'s  [[Goldstrike mine]], [[Nevada]] used trolleytrucks from 1994 to 2001 when the trolley system was decommissioned due to a large reconfiguration of the mine.&lt;ref name="hutnyak_history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barrick"&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.barrick.com/GlobalOperations/NorthAmerica/GoldstrikeProperty/default.aspx |title = Barrick Gold Corporation - Global Operations - North America - Goldstrike Property |accessdate = 2009-01-13 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090202195043/http://barrick.com/GlobalOperations/NorthAmerica/GoldstrikeProperty/default.aspx |archivedate = 2009-02-02 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system was similar to the one used in the [[Palabora]] copper mine in South Africa.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Zambia===
Trolleytrucks were used in the [[Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines]] Nchanga Mine in [[Zambia]] from 1983 until later in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="hutnyak_history"/&gt; Inexpensive [[hydroelectricity]] is generated at the [[Kariba Power Station]] along the [[Zambezi]] river and distributed throughout the "copper belt" of Zambia.  The current delivery for the trolley power assisted diesel trucks ({{convert|120|short ton|t}}) was done
through custom designed bus bars and large current collection shoes mounted on very large trolley pole-like collectors.

A '''valley-fill circuit''' is a type of passive [[power factor correction]] (PFC) circuit.
For purposes of illustration, a basic [[Diode bridge|full-wave diode-bridge rectifier]] is shown in the first stage, which converts the AC input voltage to a DC voltage.  

==Operation==
When the AC voltage is applied, the rectified line voltage is applied across C1 and C2, as they are both charged via D3 and R1, until C1 and C2 are each charged up to approximately half of the peak line voltage. 
When the line voltage falls below the peak, into the "valley" phase, Vout begins to fall toward half of the peak line voltage.  At this point, C1 and C2 begin to discharge into the load at Vout, via D1 and D2 respectively.   
R1 is needed to prevent a large in-rush current, and [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI).&lt;ref name=Sum97&gt;https://www.coilws.com/Publications/ImprVF.pdf Valley fill circuits&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
An advantage of this design is that it is rather simple.  A disadvantage is that the [[ripple (electrical)|ripple]] voltage can still be 50% of peak, and have [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD) of 35%, which is rather high. A 1998 [[United States patent]], US6141230A, provides a power factor of 0.98 and a THD of 9.61%.&lt;ref name="US6141230A"&gt;{{cite web|title=US6141230A: Valley-fill power factor correction circuit|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US6141230A/en|website=Google Patents|accessdate=23 March 2017|date=13 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sum97/&gt;

'''Wild Well Control''' is a [[well control]] company based in [[Houston, Texas]] that has worked to mitigate several high-profile well control issues including the Kuwaiti oil fires and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

According to its website it has responded to 2,700 well control and pressure control events including the majority of the large international well control emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwell.com/index.php?page=experience |title=Wild Well Control, Inc. - Houston, Texas - Experience |publisher=Wildwell.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a subsidiary of [[Superior Energy Services]].

==History==
Wild Well Control was founded by Joe R. Bowden, Sr. in 1975 (July 15, 1932 – November 12, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwell.com/index.php?page=joe-r-bowden-sr |title=Wild Well Control, Inc. - Houston, Texas - Joe R. Bowden, Sr |publisher=Wildwell.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its main competition was [[Red Adair|Red Adair and Company]].  In 1991 it was one of the companies used to cap the [[Kuwaiti oil fires]].  Its involvement was the subject of the documentary ''[[Fires of Kuwait]]''.  In 2001 it was acquired by [[Superior Energy Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwell.com/index.php?page=about-us |title=Wild Well Control, Inc. - Houston, Texas - About Wild Well Control, Inc |publisher=Wildwell.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 it received a contract for $750 million to decommission seven downed platforms and related well facilities located offshore Louisiana belonging to [[British Petroleum|BP]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and [[Apache Corporation]].

In 2010 it was designated by BP to come up with a way to cap the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialpost.com/news/Wild+Well+containment+struggle/3142584/story.html |title=Wild Well mum on BP containment struggle |publisher=Financialpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zotye Z100''' is a [[Subcompact car|subcompact]] [[hatchback]] produced by [[Zotye Auto]]. Originally launched as the new Jiangnan TT in prototype form, the production version was renamed to Zotye Z100 to fit into the refreshed Zotye product line. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2015/11/13/spy-shots-haval-h7-h7l-naked-from-all-sides-in-china/|title=Spy Shots: Haval H7 &amp; H7L naked from all Sides in China}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2013/03/21/zoyte-z100-will-be-launched-on-the-shanghai-auto-show/|title=Zoyte Z100 will be launched on the Shanghai Auto Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Zotye Z100 debuted during the 2012 [[Shanghai Auto Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2013/04/21/zotye-z100-launched-at-the-shanghai-auto-show/|title=Zotye Z100 launched at the Shanghai Auto Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was launched in the Chinese market since September 2013, replacing the Jiangnan TT, which was based on the Suzuki Alto CA71 sold from 1988 to 2013 in China. The only engine choice for the Z100 is a 1.0 litre 3 cylinder engine known as the TNN3G10K. A 5 speed manual is also paired with it. It is currently the cheapest car in China ranging from 30,000 yuan to 35,000 yuan. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2012/05/02/zotye-z100-will-be-very-cheap-in-china/|title=Zotye Z100 will be very Cheap in China}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2013/04/15/official-pictures-the-zotye-z100-is-ready-for-the-shanghai-auto-show/|title=Official Pictures: the Zotye Z100 is Ready for the Shanghai Auto show}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the styling of the Zotye Z100 being very similar to the Suzuki Alto, and the predecessor, Jiangnan TT being a licensed rebadge version of the Suzuki Alto, the Zotye Z100 has nothing to do with Suzuki, but rather a car with styling heavily inspired by the [[Suzuki Alto]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2013/03/21/zoyte-z100-will-be-launched-on-the-shanghai-auto-show/|title=Zoyte Z100 will be launched on the Shanghai Auto Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zotye Z100 was discontinued after a short run, but the electric versions including the Zotye Cloud 100Plus and Zotye Cloud 100S continued to be sold.
