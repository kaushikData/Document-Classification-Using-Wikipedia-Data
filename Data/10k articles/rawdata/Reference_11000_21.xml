'''Africa.com''' is an internet media company. Launched in 2010 by [[Teresa Clarke]], the company has grown into a media company providing coverage on topics such financial, political and cultural news related to Africa. Using the online [[web portal]] about the continent, its main purpose is to be a unique platform for anyone interested in Africa to learn more about all aspects of the continent. Also it provides for both business and world leaders accurate information about the investment climate.

The Africa.com organization has representation offices in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa; [[Lagos]], Nigeria; and [[New York City]], United States. African American business woman and entrepreneur [[Teresa Clarke]] is the CEO and founder of the site; [[CBS News]] correspondent Jacqueline Adams is the executive editor, and [[Jendayi Frazer]] (Ambassador to South Africa) is an advisory board member.

== History ==
Africa.com was launched in February 2010, by Teresa Clarke after resigning from her position as a managing director in the investment banking division of [[Goldman Sachs &amp; Co]].&lt;ref name="thestreet1"&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10680468/goldman-sachs-managing-director-teresa-clarke-resigns-to-run-reorganized-tech-company-africacom.html Goldman Sachs Managing Director Teresa Clarke Resigns To Run Reorganized Tech Company, Africa.com - TheStreet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105051532/http://www.thestreet.com/story/10680468/goldman-sachs-managing-director-teresa-clarke-resigns-to-run-reorganized-tech-company-africacom.html |date=November 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke is also co-founder of the [[Student Sponsorship Programme]] in South Africa.

Clarke lived in South Africa from 1995 to 2000 and acquired the domain name around 2001. "Over most of the last decade, I worked at Goldman Sachs. During my free time, I imagined what I would do with the domain name and I looked at other African websites."&lt;ref name="memeburn1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://memeburn.com/2011/03/africa-com-the-domain-that-launched-a-startup/|title=Africa.com: The domain that launched a startup - Memeburn|date=2011-03-08|work=Memeburn|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article from May 2010, Africa.com was mentioned because of its potential relevance with the impending [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa that same year. "The site is small—with about 50,000 monthly unique users—but Ms. Clarke said she sees potential in the growth of African investment and a middle class in several African countries."&lt;ref name="wsj1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/05/28/from-goldman-sachs-to-an-africa-tech-start-up/|title=From Goldman Sachs to an Africa Tech Start-Up|last=Valentino-DeVries|first=Jennifer|date=2010-05-28|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Africa.com has expanded to add information about each of the continent's 54 countries,&lt;ref name="thestreet1"/&gt; with over 30,000 daily visitors according to Alexa.com.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

== Partnerships==
Recently Africa.com has partnered with a number of well-known content providers including [[The Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Foreign Affairs]] and HAND/EYE Magazines, [[McKinsey and Company]], [[Freedom House]] and the [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]]. It has also developed its own original content including blogs from the likes of a former president of Nigeria and several U.S. ambassadors to various African countries.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/teresa-clarke/brava-brava-arianna_1_b_821253.html|title=Brava! Brava, Arianna!|last=Clarke|first=Teresa|date=2011-02-13|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also it has published the first and only online museum guide providing detailed information about museums in every African country. Thus becoming a heavily visited site and destination for users from different continents interested in Africa.&lt;ref name="thestreet1"/&gt;

The site aims to provide travel information, financial, political and cultural news, maps, information about international events and non-profit organizations related to Africa, as well as views from a varied array of opinion-leaders. It also provides encyclopedic information about each of the 54 countries on the African continent, with specially written travel information about 54 countries and 27 cities as well as 200 curated videos. Designed in collaboration with Brightcove Inc., Africa.com offers the same flexible, multi-language, on-line video platform used by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacca.biz/?m=5&amp;idkey=769 Africa.com re-launches, headed by Teresa Clarke – Changing the way the world views Africa : PROFILES : SACCA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724104109/http://www.sacca.biz/?m=5&amp;idkey=769 |date=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 2011, Africa.com received over three million page views from almost one million users, the majority from the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt;

On a March 2011 interview to Memeburn.com, Teresa Clarke said, "For me, ownership of the Africa.com domain name is about more than a business opportunity. I see this as a tremendous privilege and a great responsibility. Whoever owns this domain name has a monumental opportunity to shape how the internet world views Africa. Africa has been very good to me throughout my life and my career, and I wanted to step up to the challenge of ensuring that this great vehicle for change is used responsibly and effectively."&lt;ref name="memeburn1"/&gt;

On Thursday April 28, 2011, the President of the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]], Dr. [[Goodluck Ebele Jonathan]] pledged government support and collaboration with the [[Tony Elumelu Foundation]] (TEF) when he hosted founder Tony Elumelu and the TEF Advisory Board in [[Abuja]], stating that relevant government institutions will be asked to work with the foundation. The Advisory Board members who accompanied Elumelu when he paid a courtesy call on the President included Teresa Clarke, founder and CEO of Africa.com and H. E. [[Shaukat Aziz]], former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanexaminer.com/foundation0430 Jonathan commends the Tony Elumelu foundation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503182830/http://www.africanexaminer.com/foundation0430 |date=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke said Africa.com is working on a platform that would allow people to check stock-market prices and make transactions on their cellphones.&lt;ref name="wsj1"/&gt;

== Country profiles ==
Africa.com offers an encyclopedia, nicknamed “Afripedia”, that aims to provide information about each of the 54 sovereign states, including [[Madagascar]] and various island groups. Every country profile offers an overview of said country, as well as historic, geographic, economic and social data. The section also includes a fact and figures entry, information about the leaders of the country, and a "[[Freedom House reports|Rights and Liberties Report]]".

The site also offers interaction with [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]], travel and music videos, and short films and documentaries.

== Rights and Liberties Report ==
In partnership with [[Freedom House]], Africa.com brings information on the human rights and civil liberties of every African country. Basic freedoms, political rights, freedom of religion, the right to free speech, free elections, political freedom, Africa human rights.

The "[[Freedom House reports|Rights and Liberties Report]]" is a scored provided by Freedom House, an advocacy organization that monitors and supports the expansion of freedom around the world. The organization has developed a survey to measure and rate worldwide political rights and civil liberties. A rating of 1 indicates the highest degree of freedom and 7 the least amount of freedom. The political rights and civil liberties ratings for each country or territory are combined and averaged to determine an overall "freedom status".

Countries and territories with a combined average rating of 1.0 to 2.5 are considered "Free"; 3.0 to 5.0, "Partly Free"; and 5.5 to 7.0 "Not Free". On Africa.com, upward or downward trend arrows are assigned to countries and territories. Trend arrows indicate general positive or negative trends since the previous survey that are not necessarily reflected in the raw points and does not warrant a ratings change.

== Ibrahim Index ==
Being an aggregator of information regarding the African continent, Africa.com features the [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]] funded and led by the [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]]. It is an attempt to statistically monitor African [[governance]] levels throughout all the countries of Africa.

== Safari Wizard ==
Recently Africa.com partnered with Rhino Africa, a South African [[safari]] operator, to develop the Safari Wizard guide. This tool aims to help users design a custom safari among the main safari destinations in Africa: [[South Africa]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Namibia]]. It offers a filter with which users can select different criteria, including location, children facilities, means of transportation, activities, cost, facilities, lodging amenities and animal sightings.

It also offers a Safari Advisor guide that aims to suit different safari customers based on their travel habits, destination of choice, activities they are looking for and additional requirements (e.g. vaccines for [[yellow fever]], [[malaria]], visa requirements, packing tips and safety concerns).

Aside from a traveling blog, it also offers maps and travel information as well as a museum guide for each country, that provides information of when to go, how to get there, what to do, safety and security tips and local advice. The Travel Health section holds information for tourists about vaccinations, medications, and other health advice for travel in Africa.

It also Africa.com offers direct links with other travel website like [[Tripadvisor]].com, Bookingbuddy.com and [[STA Travel]] for booking flights, hotels, get deals and organizing trips.

The site offers business and financial information to its visitors, aside from that provided by the finance blog posts, based on information from the Council on Foreign Relations, [[Reuters]] Africa and ''Foreign Affairs'' magazine.  It also offers articles, videos and interviews from McKinsey Quarterly.

Recently Africa.com began to offer the Africa-related articles of HAND/EYE Magazine, a New York-based print and online publication focused on global arts, crafts, design, and culture. HAND/EYE aims to highlight creative projects and ventures originating in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa.com/handeye/ Hand/Eye Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125150/http://www.africa.com/handeye/ |date=June 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa.com devotes a feature to ''Africa First'', the short film program is sponsored by [[Focus Features]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focusfeatures.com/africafirst/index.php Africa First]&lt;/ref&gt; The Africa First Short Film Program aims to support films that aspire to artistic excellence and accomplished storytelling, and substantially contribute to the development of local film industries. Award recipients of the 2010 Focus Features Africa First Short Film Program can use award money received from Africa First to complete initial production and to pay for post-production costs such as laboratory fees, sound mixing, and editing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focusfeatures.com/africafirst/recipients.php?year=2009 Africa First &amp;#124; Recipients &amp;#124; 2009 &amp;#124; Short Film Program for African Filmmakers]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audience ==
The site's primary audience is American, aims to shape the opinion of Americans on Africa using African sources, rather than the Western media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tnj.com/25-Influential-black-women/2011/teresa-h-clarke|title=Black Business {{!}} Black News and Career ideas for Black Professionals|website=The Network Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826053546/http://www.tnj.com/25-Influential-black-women/2011/teresa-h-clarke|archive-date=2014-08-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress''''' is a [[biographical dictionary]] of all present and former members of the [[United States Congress]] and its predecessor, the [[Continental Congress]]. Also included are [[Delegate#United States|Delegates]] from territories and the [[District of Columbia]] and [[Resident commissioner#American English|Resident Commissioners]] from the [[Philippines]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

The online edition also includes a guide to research collections (a list of institutions where member's papers, [[Letter (message)|letters]], [[letter (message)|correspondence]], and other items are archived) as well as an extended [[bibliography]] of published works concerning the member (a shorter bibliography is included with the member's biography).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov Online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; These additional resources when available can be accessed via links on the left side of the member's page on the website.

==History==
[[Charles Lanman]], author, journalist, and former secretary to [[Daniel Webster]], gathered the first collection of biographies of former and sitting members of Congress for his ''Dictionary of Congress'', published by [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.]] in 1859. Lanman intended his ''Dictionary of the United States Congress'' to serve primarily as a guide for sitting Members of Congress, much as the ''Congressional Directory'' functions today.

In 1864, the House of Representatives and the Senate approved the publication of an updated version of Lanman's ''Dictionary of Congress'' by the recently established [[Government Printing Office#History|Government Printing Office]]. In the late 1860s Congress offered [[Benjamin Perley Poore]], a journalist and clerk of the Senate Committee on Printing and Records, the job of preparing a ''Congressional Directory'' with biographical sketches and the kind of reference information found in the ''Dictionary of Congress''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CDOC-108hdoc222/pdf/GPO-CDOC-108hdoc222.pdf#page=7 House Document 108-222, p. xi]&lt;/ref&gt;

In anticipation of the centenary of American independence and in search of a market not served by Poore's ''Congressional Directory'', Lanman prepared the ''Biographical Annals of the Civil Government of the United States'', published by James Anglim of Washington, D.C. in 1876. This volume combined the biographies of the ''Dictionary of Congress'' with entries for other governmental officials since 1776 and expanded reference tables. Poore offered a competing historical volume in 1878 with his ''Political Register and Congressional Directory'', published by [[Houghton Mifflin|Houghton, Osgood and Company, Boston]].

Joseph M. Morrison's revision of Lanman's ''Biographical Annals'' (New York, 1887) was the final directory of congressional biography to be prepared and published privately. In 1903 Congress authorized the publication of ''A Biographical Congressional Directory, 1774 to 1903''. Compiled under the direction of O. M. Enyart, this was the first volume prepared by congressional staff who drew on the Lanman and Poore editions as well as biographical information printed in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090430050452/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/cdirectory/index.html ''Congressional Directory''] since the [[40th United States Congress]] (1867). The most thorough and systematic revision of biographical entries attempted prior to the Bicentennial Edition was conducted in preparation for the ''Biographical Directory of the American Congress, 1774–1927''. Ansel Wold, chief clerk of the [[Joint Committee on Printing]], directed the compilation of this volume published in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CDOC-108hdoc222/pdf/GPO-CDOC-108hdoc222.pdf#page=8 House Document 108-222, p. xii]&lt;/ref&gt;

This survey of the 1920s yielded more detailed and consistent biographies than had been found in the nineteenth-century editions or in the earlier volumes compiled by congressional staff. The frequent reliance on family legends and personal recollections, however, introduced dubious information into the volume. Although Congress authorized updates that were published in 1950, 1961, and 1971, the entries from the 1928 edition remained virtually intact in the three subsequent editions. The creation of the [[Historian of the United States Senate|Senate Historical Office]] in 1975 and the [[Office for the Bicentennial]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1983 provided the first opportunity for professional historians to revise and update the Biographical Directory. Earlier editions of the Biographical Directory and their nineteenth century predecessors offered little information on congressional careers other than terms of service. The bicentennial edition provided a more complete record of the individual Members' years in office. A 1996 edition was published by [[Congressional Quarterly]], but did not achieve wide circulation due to the much higher cover price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CDOC-108hdoc222/pdf/GPO-CDOC-108hdoc222.pdf#page=8 House Document 108-222, p. xii]&lt;/ref&gt;

The development and growing use of the [[Internet]] in the 1990s led to the creation of websites for the House of Representatives and the Senate. Ray Strong, Assistant to the [[Office of the Clerk|Clerk of the House]], advocated the idea of publishing the entries from the Biographical Directory on the Internet. Through the efforts of Joe Carmel, Cindy S. Leach, and Gary Hahn of [[Office of the Clerk#Legislative Computer Systems (LCS)|Legislative Computer Systems]] under the [[Office of the Clerk|Clerk of the House]], and Cheri Allen of the [[Secretary of the United States Senate|Office of the Secretary of the Senate]], the entries of the Biographical Directory became available online during the week of November 9, 1998, at http://bioguide.congress.gov/ under the auspices of the [[Office of the Clerk#Legislative Resource Center (LRC)|House Legislative Resource Center]] and the [[Historian of the United States Senate|Senate Historical Office]]. Internet technology has allowed the editors to update entries of the Biographical Directory on a daily basis. Besides the biographies, the online database includes extensive bibliographies and a guide to all available research collections for Senate and House entries. The project was the first [[SGML]]/[[XML]] project for the House and Senate and paved the way for the drafting of legislation in XML in both chambers.

The online version, accessible to the public, also has benefited from updated information provided to the [[Office of the Clerk#Office of History and Preservation (OHP)|House Office of History and Preservation]] and the [[Historian of the United States Senate|Senate Historical Office]] from scholars, librarians, genealogists, and family members. Senate entries are accompanied by an image of the Senator, when available. Online House entries include images for women Members and Speakers with official oil portraits and members since the [[109th United States Congress]] (2005).

The data is maintained by staff in the Office of the Clerk's [[Office of the Clerk#Office of History and Preservation (OHP)|Office of History and Preservation]] and the Office of the [[Historian of the United States Senate]].

==Technical detail==
The index value in the [[URL]] is a unique value for each member of Congress. There are some duplicates for name changes: [http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C000380] and [http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C001039] refer to the same person. The ID is also re-used in [[XML]] versions of House legislation (see http://congress.gov and http://xml.house.gov).

'''Biological Abstracts''' is a database produced by [[Clarivate Analytics]]. It includes [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] from [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] articles in the fields of [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[biotechnology]], [[botany]], pre-clinical and experimental [[medicine]], [[pharmacology]], [[zoology]], [[agriculture]], and [[veterinary medicine]] published since 1926.&lt;ref name=BA&gt;{{cite web

It can be accessed through  number of services, including [[EBSCO]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebscohost.com/documents/flyer/academic/biological-abstracts]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ovid.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=13051&amp;catalogId=13151&amp;langId=-1&amp;partNumber=Prod-24]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Web of Science]].&lt;ref name=BA/&gt; 

==History==
The service began as a print publication in 1926, when it was formed by the union of '''''Abstracts of Bacteriology''''' (1917–25), and '''''Botanical Abstracts '''''(1919–26), both published in Baltimore by Williams and Wilkins.&lt;ref name=Sheehy10&gt;Sheehy, ''Guide to Reference Books'', 10th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in paperback subject sections, with abstracts usually written by scientist in the US, as a great many of articles in that period were in other languages. At the time of founding it was in competition with the classified indexing service of the [[Concilium Bibliographicum]] in Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burke|first1=Colin B.|title=Information and Intrigue: From Index Cards to Dewey Decimals to Alger Hiss|date=2014|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-02702-1|pages=166-168 &amp; 235-237}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first online version was published on magnetic tape; it contained only the bibliographic information, not the text of the abstracts, and was intended as a rapid alerting service.

== Early life ==
Backlund was born in [[Princeton, Minnesota]], in 1949. During his freshman year, Backlund was an [[All-American]] in both [[football]] and wrestling ({{convert|191|lb|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}, finishing third) while at [[Waldorf College|Waldorf Junior College]] in [[Forest City, Iowa]]. During his sophomore campaign, Backlund focused on wrestling and once again earned All American Honors ({{convert|190|lb|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} and national runner-up). Backlund was an [[Amateur wrestling|amateur wrestler]] at [[North Dakota State Bison wrestling|North Dakota State University]], winning the Division II NCAA Championship at 190 pounds in 1971. In 1972 Backlund moved up to the heavyweight class and finished fifth at the NCAA DII Nationals.&lt;ref name="WWF80s"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Shields|title=Main event – WWE in the raging 80s|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6|pages=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a graduate of [[Princeton High School (Minnesota)|Princeton High School]], where he was a state finalist in wrestling. He graduated from [[North Dakota State University]] with a degree in [[physical education]].

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1973−1977) ===
Backlund was trained for professional wrestling by renowned trainer [[Eddie Sharkey]] and made his debut for the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) in 1973. Backlund's clean cut look and technical approach made him a natural [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]], and he quickly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|got over]] with the fans.&lt;ref name="WWF80s"/&gt; After leaving the AWA, Backlund traveled the United States, working for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in its various [[List of NWA territories|territories]]. In 1974, Backlund wrestled in [[Texas]], for [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] and [[Terry Funk]]'s [[Amarillo, Texas]]-based [[Western States Sports]] promotion. In March, he defeated Terry Funk for the [[NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship]] (the promotion's top title). Backlund held it for two months, before losing it to [[Kurt and Karl Von Steiger|Karl Von Steiger]] in May.&lt;ref name="Titles"&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1975, Backlund started working for [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] (GCW). He teamed with [[Gerald Brisco|Jerry Brisco]] to win the [[NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship]] from [[Charles Kalani, Jr.|Toru Tanaka]] and [[Mr. Fuji]] in October 1975. They held the [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belts]] for two months before losing to [[Les Thornton]] and Tony Charles. In 1976, Backlund left Georgia for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWF, NWA Florida). Here he teamed with [[Steve Keirn]] to defeat [[Bob Orton, Jr.]] and [[Bob Roop]] for the [[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship]]. Backlund and Keirn lost the title to [[Hollywood Blonds#Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown|The Hollywood Blonds]] ([[Buddy Roberts]] and Jerry Brown) in October 1976.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; While working for NWA Florida, Backlund also wrestled in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], for [[Sam Muchnick]]'s [[St. Louis Wrestling Club]]. He defeated [[Harley Race]] to win the [[NWA Missouri Heavyweight Championship]] on April 23, 1976, and he lost the title to [[Jack Brisco]] on November 26.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation===
==== Road to the title and early successes (1977−1978) ====
In early 1977, Backlund joined [[Vincent J. McMahon]]'s [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/77.htm|title=WWWF Show Results 1977|date=February 8, 1977|quote=Bob Backlund &amp; Tony Garea defeated Jose Estrada &amp; Pete Doherty (first result listed for Backlund in the WWWF)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managed]] by [[Arnold Skaaland|"The Golden Boy" Arnold Skaaland]]. Less than four months into his WWWF run, Backlund received his first shot at the [[WWE World Championship|WWWF Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Superstar Billy Graham]], but he lost by [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]]. Through 1977, Backlund received additional title shots at the champion, and his fortunes started to change; the two went to a double [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] in one match,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/77.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1977|quote=WWWF World Champion Superstar Billy Graham fought Bob Backlund to a double count-out}}&lt;/ref&gt; then Backlund defeated Graham, but by countout (the title can only change hands via pinfall or submission).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/77.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1977|quote=Bob Backlund defeated WWWF World Champion Superstar Billy Graham via count-out}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 20, 1978, at [[Madison Square Garden]], Backlund finally scored a [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]] victory over Graham and won the title,&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; despite Graham's leg being on the rope during the pinfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/78.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1978|quote=Bob Backlund pinned WWWF World Champion Superstar Billy Graham to win the title at 15:51 with the [[Professional wrestling throws#Atomic drop|atomic drop]], even though the champion's foot was on the bottom rope during the pinfall.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backlund's early challengers for the title included [[Spiros Arion]], Mr. Fuji, [[Ivan Koloff]], [[George Steele|George "the Animal" Steele]], and [[Ken Patera]], and had his first high-profile title match in Japan, defending against [[Antonio Inoki]]. He also won a series of rematches against Graham, including an April 1978 [[Professional wrestling match types#Steel Cages|steel cage match]] at [[Madison Square Garden]].

Three days after winning the WWWF Heavyweight Championship, Backlund clashed with the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] Harley Race in a rare "WWWF vs. NWA" title match. Both titles were on the line, but neither changed hands as the two fought to a 60-minute time limit [[Professional wrestling#Draw|draw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/78.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1978|date=February 23, 1978|quote=WWWF World Champion Bob Backlund fought NWA World Champion Harley Race to a draw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending against other champions became a recurring theme in Backlund's run with the title. He faced the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]] ([[Nick Bockwinkel]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/79.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1979|quote=WWW World Champion Bob Backlund fought AWA World Champion Nick Bockwinkel to a double count-out at 39:10 when both men began brawling on the floor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two NWA World Heavyweight Champions (Harley Race four times and [[Ric Flair]] once)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Shields|title=Main event – WWE in the raging 80s|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6|pages = 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;He defeated the [[NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship|NWA Florida Heavyweight Champion]] [[Don Muraco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Shields|title=Main event – WWE in the raging 80s|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6|page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, he battled "International Champion" [[Billy Robinson]] to a 63-minute curfew draw in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Shields|title=Main event – WWE in the raging 80s|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his run, Backlund and [[Peter Maivia]] formed a successful [[tag team]] and challenged for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWWF World Tag Team Championship]], then held by [[The Yukon Lumberjacks]]. During a television taping in October 1978, Maivia [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned on]] and attacked him and Skaaland. In the immediate aftermath, fans for the first time got to see another side of Backlund's personality: that of a raving, ranting maniac when angered or pushed hard enough; in the post-match interview, Backlund screamed to interviewer [[Vince McMahon]] that he was going to "kill that son of a bitch!" Backlund eventually won a series of matches against Maivia, including a steel cage match in January 1979 at Madison Square Garden.

In 1979, the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) became the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). On November 30, 1979, [[NWF Heavyweight Championship|NWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Antonio Inoki]] defeated Backlund in Tokushima, Japan to win the WWF title. Backlund then won a rematch on December 6. However, WWF president [[Hisashi Shinma]] declared the re-match a no contest due to interference from [[Tiger Jeet Singh]], and Inoki remained Champion. Inoki refused the title on the same day, and it was declared vacant. Backlund later defeated [[Bobby Duncum, Sr.|Bobby Duncum]] in a Texas Death match to regain the title on December 17. As Inoki refused the title, his reign is not included nor is it recognized by WWE in its official history.

On August 9, 1980, Backlund teamed with [[Pedro Morales]] to capture the WWF Tag Team Championship from [[The Wild Samoans]] at [[Showdown at Shea#1980|Showdown at Shea]]. Backlund and Morales were forced to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vacant|vacate]] the title due to a then-extant WWF rule stating that no one can hold two [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]] at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Shields|title=Main event – WWE in the raging 80s|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backlund had more tag team success when he (along with Antonio Inoki) won the "1980 MSG Tag Team League Tournament", last defeating [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Stan Hansen]] on December 10 in Osaka, Japan. Backlund and Inoki finished the tournament with seven wins and two double-countout decisions.

Also during 1980, Backlund and Hogan met in a series of highly publicized matches; although he scored several countout victories over Hogan, Backlund never was able to score a decisive victory over his charismatic young challenger, and Hogan – showing flashes of his future superstardom – proved to be one of Backlund's toughest opponents. Backlund was also able to overcome a challenge from Ken Patera, with whom he feuded on-and-off from 1978 until early 1981, including during Patera's reign as [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion]].

==== Early 1980s: continued success ====
Backlund's WWF Heavyweight Championship was held up after a match in [[New York City]] against [[Greg Valentine|Greg "The Hammer" Valentine]] on October 19, 1981, after a dazed referee "accidentally" gave the championship belt to Valentine as part of the storyline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/81.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1981|date=October 19, 1981|quote=WWF World Champion Bob Backlund pinned Greg Valentine at 19:32; the title was held up after the battle when the dazed referee accidentally gave the title to Valentine; the title controversy was only a factor in NYC as Backlund continued to defend the title until the following month's rematch}}&lt;/ref&gt; it constituted an interruption of Backlund's title reign. However, Backlund was billed as the WWF Heavyweight Champion in other cities in the days following the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/81.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1981|date=October 20, 1981|quote=WWF World Champion Bob Backlund fought WWF IC Champion Don Muraco to a draw}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of the 1980s, when no promotion held nationally televised events, it was not uncommon practice to "hold up" the title in one area (to build interest in a rematch the "former" champion would win) while ignoring the situation in other parts of the territory. On November 23, Backlund pinned Valentine for the "Vacant in New York Only" WWF Heavyweight Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/81.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1981|quote=Bob Backlund (w/ Arnold Skaaland) pinned Greg Valentine to win the vacant WWF World Heavyweight title at 15:36 with a German suplex into a bridge after avoiding a punch; in a move that was only recognized in the NYC area, the championship was vacated the previous month when the referee accidentally handed Valentine the title following his loss to Backlund}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rematch for the title, held inside a steel cage at the [[Spectrum (arena)|Philadelphia Spectrum]] in January 1982, also saw Backlund emerge the winner, securing the victory when he hit a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] on Valentine into the mat. Even with the title being held up against Antonio Inoki and Greg Valentine, Bob Backlund is recognized by WWE as having one continuous title reign from 1978 to 1983 as WWE Champion.

Backlund continued to be successful into 1982 and 1983, successfully defending against a variety of contenders, ranging from [[Adrian Adonis]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.|"Cowboy" Bob Orton]], [[Big John Studd]], Ivan Koloff, [[Don Muraco|Magnificent Muraco]] and [[Sgt. Slaughter]]. One of his most memorable encounters came in mid-1982, when he won a steel cage match against [[Jimmy Snuka|"Superfly" Jimmy Snuka]]; in that match, at [[Madison Square Garden]], Snuka scaled the top of the cage, intending to perform his [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|"Superfly" splash]] onto a prone Backlund to incapacitate him, but Backlund moved after Snuka began to fly through the air and went on to escape the cage. He also turned back a challenge from Superstar Billy Graham, who returned to the WWF in late 1982 wanting to reclaim the championship.

==== End of an era ====
After having been popular with the fans from early on, in the final months of his title reign, Backlund changed his image, cutting his mop hair into a crew cut, wearing amateur wrestling singlets and losing muscle mass and definition. Fans seemingly grew weary of this "[[Howdy Doody]]" character (as [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]] had dubbed him). In 1983, he was voted the ''[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'''s ''[[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Most Overrated|Most Overrated Wrestler]]''. [[Vince McMahon]], who had bought the WWF from his father, wanted to put the title on the more charismatic and muscular Hulk Hogan. McMahon initially suggested Backlund to turn [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and lose to Hogan, but when Backlund refused, a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Transitional champion|transitional champion]] became necessary between Backlund and Hogan. Backlund sustained a ([[kayfabe]]) injury when [[The Iron Sheik]] assaulted him with his Persian clubs and on December 26, 1983, Backlund lost the title to Sheik when Backlund's manager, [[Arnold Skaaland]], threw in the towel while Backlund was locked in the [[Professional wrestling holds#Camel clutch|camel clutch]].&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

Due to Backlund's (kayfabe) injury, Hogan took over Backlund's rematch and became the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion.&lt;ref name="SLH"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaun Assael and Mike Mooneyham|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2004|edition=Reprint|pages=33–34|isbn=978-1-4000-5143-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was a television storyline only; Backlund wrestled The Iron Sheik at least three times for the title, all at non-televised [[house show]]s (including once at the [[Boston Garden]], winning by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]]), and also wrestled The Magnificent Muraco for the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, also at a non-televised house show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Backlund continued to work for the WWF for a while after the title change, but did not receive another title shot for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after Hogan's victory. On August 4, 1984, Backlund defeated [[Salvatore Bellomo]] in his last WWF match for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Shields|title=Main event – WWE in the raging 80s|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the WWF and semi-retirement (1984–1992) ===
After leaving the WWF, Backlund had a run in the short-lived [[Pro Wrestling USA]], a joint promotion of the NWA and the AWA, meant to combat the national expansion of the WWF. In Pro Wrestling USA, Backlund unsuccessfully challenged [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Rick Martel]]. He soon dropped out of the pro wrestling scene, but he made a surprise return in 1991 for [[Herb Abrams]]' short-lived [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF). At "[[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)#Beach Brawl|Beach Brawl]]" (the UWF's only [[pay-per-view]] event), he defeated Ivan Koloff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/uwf-abrams/|title=UWF Beach Brawl Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backlund also wrestled for [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan)#Newborn UWF|Newborn UWF]] and [[UWF International]] in Japan, in a series of matches with [[Nobuhiko Takada]]. During his time away from the ring, he coached amateur wrestling at [[Bacon Academy]] and Rocky Hill High School in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.courant.com/1999-02-05/news/9902050166_1_bob-backlund-hulk-hogan-world-wrestling-federation-champion&gt; "Forget Venture: Connecticut Pro Wrestler Hopes To Take Down Congressman Larson", by David Daley, ''Hartford Courant''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to WWF (1992–2000) ===
In 1992, Backlund returned to the WWF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm|title=WWF Show Results 1992|quote=Bob Backlund pinned Skinner (Backlund's return after 8 years)}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his absence, the WWF had expanded into an international wrestling promotion, due in part to the colorful characters of the "Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection Era", which Hulk Hogan helped to kickstart eight years prior. Backlund, whose persona remained the same as it was in his heyday, seemed to be out of step with the evolution of the WWF. Many fans did not remember him, as he had left just prior to Vince McMahon's national expansion. His initial return to the WWF was largely uneventful and he mainly wrestled mid-card matches. However, at the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|1993 Royal Rumble]], Backlund, the number two entrant lasted sixty-one minutes and ten seconds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble3.xls|title=WWF Royal Rumble Statistics|author=prowrestlinghistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a duration record that stood until 2004, when [[Chris Benoit]] broke it. Backlund's first appearance at [[WrestleMania]] was the [[WrestleMania IX|IX edition]], where he was quickly pinned by [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Razor Ramon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#IX|title=WWF WrestleMania Results (IX)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backlund also received several shots at the Intercontinental Championship, then held by [[Shawn Michaels]].

On the July 30, 1994 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'', Backlund wrestled what was billed as an "Old Generation vs. New Generation" match with [[Bret Hart]], with Hart's WWF World Heavyweight Championship on the line. Over the preceding weeks, the WWF aired vignettes of Backlund training for this match. Hart won the match, capitalizing after Backlund mistakenly believed he had won and helped Hart to his feet. Backlund "snapped" after Hart repeatedly tried to offer a sportsmanlike handshake following the match. He slapped Hart in the face and locked him in the [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface chickenwing|crossface chickenwing]] submission hold, while screaming hysterically. After finally releasing the hold, Backlund stared at his hands in apparent shock. Backlund then started to regularly "snap" in similar fashion during his matches, viciously attacking his opponent with the crossface chickenwing and refusing to release it after the opponent submitted. He would then seemingly snap back to normal and appear horrified by what he had done.&lt;ref name="WWF80s"/&gt;

On an episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', shortly after his match with Hart, Backlund claimed that he should still be considered the legitimate WWF World Heavyweight Champion, as he had not been pinned by The Iron Sheik, nor [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submitted]] to the camel clutch. Backlund continued wrestling under the new [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] of an out of touch and highly volatile eccentric, out to teach "The New Generation" a lesson.&lt;ref name="WWF80s"/&gt; He dressed in business suits (complete with a bow tie), had a hyperactive personality and used (and often misused, for comic effect) large words during his interviews. He demanded that he be addressed as Mr. Backlund, and he would only sign autographs for wrestling fans if they could recite the names of all of the [[President of the United States|United States Presidents]] in [[Chronology|chronological order]]. On several instances, he assaulted wrestlers and other WWF employees and placed them in the crossface chickenwing. These victims include [[Jim Ross]], [[Duke Droese|Duke "The Dumpster" Droese]], ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'' writer Lou Gianfriddo, and his former manager Arnold Skaaland, who he blamed for costing him the WWF Heavyweight Championship in 1983.

On November 23, 1994, at the [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Backlund faced Bret Hart in a special [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|submission match]] for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship where the only way for a wrestler to win was to have the opponent's valet, like Arnold Skaaland did for Backlund over a decade earlier, stop the match by throwing a towel into the ring. Backlund began displaying a white towel that he claimed was the same one that was thrown into the ring the night he lost to The Iron Sheik. To serve as his second for the match, Backlund paired up with [[Owen Hart]], the brother and chief rival of the reigning champion who had tried and failed multiple times that year to wrest the belt from Bret. 

Late in the match, as Backlund was locked in Hart's trademark Sharpshooter submission, Owen entered the ring and attacked Bret from behind to cause him to break the hold. Bret's cornerman for the match, [[Davey Boy Smith]], chased Owen around the ring only to collide head first with the ring stairs. When Bret turned around to argue with his brother, Backlund took advantage and locked the crossface chickenwing on the champion. Hart fought the hold for an unprecedented eight-and-a-half minutes, but refused to give up. 

Since Smith was unconscious on the floor, he was unable to save Hart. Owen took advantage by picking up the pink and black towel Smith carried and, feigning concern for the well being of his brother, approached his father [[Stu Hart|Stu]] and his mother Helen who were seated at ringside. As Backlund continued to cinch in the crossface chickenwing in the ring, Owen pleaded for his parents to stop the match. Stu refused, not trusting Owen's motives. Helen, however, did not want to see Bret risk further injury and she grabbed the towel and threw it into the ring. Backlund was awarded the championship and celebrated in the ring while Owen rejoiced in finally having cost his brother the championship. After the match, Backlund conducted a brief interview which he concluded by screaming how he felt "like [[God]]".&lt;ref name="WWF80s"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

Backlund's second reign as WWF World Heavyweight Champion was brief, as he lost the title three days later to [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] at a non-televised show in Madison Square Garden,&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; the site of many of Backlund's victories in the 1970s and 1980s. Diesel kicked Backlund in the stomach, hit him with a ''[[Powerbomb#Release powerbomb|Jackknife Powerbomb]]'' and pinned him in eight seconds.&lt;ref name="WWF80s"/&gt; For weeks afterwards, fans jeered Backlund with chants of "Eight seconds! Eight seconds!". In a 2005 interview for the ''[[Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter|Pro Wrestling Torch]]'', Kevin Nash (a.k.a. Diesel) recalled how Backlund [[Sell (professional wrestling)|sold]] his ''Jackknife Powerbomb'' by crawling up the aisleway, back to the dressing room area of the Garden. Nash said, "He couldn't have put me over any stronger". This match was the last time the WWF World Heavyweight Championship changed hands at a non-televised event, and aside from [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] cash-ins, this match remains the shortest WWF title match ever; in fact, it would be tied by [[Randy Orton]] cashing in his [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank]] contract on [[Daniel Bryan]] at the [[SummerSlam (2013)|2013 SummerSlam]].

After the title loss, Backlund wrestled progressively less often, never again reaching main event status. One of his final WWF matches was an [["I Quit" match]] against Bret Hart at [[WrestleMania XI]] on April 2, 1995 which Backlund lost, even though he never actually said "I quit", instead screaming unintelligibly into the microphone, which [[Professional wrestling#Special referee|special guest referee]] [[Roddy Piper]] seemed to interpret as "I quit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/mania.html#XI|title=WWF WrestleMania Results (XI)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following WrestleMania, the WWF ran an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] in which Backlund declared his candidacy for President of the United States. Several vignettes aired, featuring Backlund preaching [[socially conservative]] values, and one showed him campaigning at a beach. Backlund also confronted a [[Bill Clinton]] [[impersonator]] who was seated at ringside at the [[Survivor Series (1995)|1995 Survivor Series]]. This angle was quietly dropped before it reached a conclusion.

From late 1996 to early 1997, Backlund joined forces with his old nemesis, The Iron Sheik, to manage [[Rikishi (wrestler)|The Sultan]] in the WWF.&lt;ref name="WWF80s"/&gt; He left the WWF shortly after [[In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker]] on April 20, where he managed The Sultan in his win over [[Too Cold Scorpio|Flash Funk]].

[[File:Backlund199809.jpg|thumb|upright|Backlund in September 1998]]
In 1999, Backlund appeared on an episode of ''[[Sunday Night Heat]]'' in a skit in which himself, The Iron Sheik, and [[Dominic Denucci]] gave comedic advice to [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] before his WWF Championship match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]].

Backlund returned to the WWF in the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|2000 Royal Rumble]]. After that, he briefly managed [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental]] and [[WWE European Championship|European]] Champion [[Kurt Angle]], and he taught his crossface chickenwing submission hold to Angle. Later on, Angle fired Backlund and locked him in that move, after discovering Backlund had booked him in a two-fall [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] against [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Chris Jericho]] (with both of his titles on the line) at [[WrestleMania 2000]], where he ultimately lost both titles.&lt;ref name="WWF80s"/&gt;

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007) ===
After many references to Bob Backlund were made by [[Kevin Nash]], he officially debuted in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) in January 2007, at the [[Final Resolution (2007)|Final Resolution]] pay-per-view, judging the finals of the Paparazzi Championship Series (PCS) between [[Alex Shelley]] and [[Austin Aries|Austin Starr]]. Given the tie breaking vote, Backlund launched a long explanation before declaring his decision a draw, and the match was restarted by PCS director Kevin Nash. After Shelley won the match, Starr pie-faced Backlund because he believed Backlund had cost him the match, at which Backlund responded by putting Starr in the crossface chickenwing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnawrestling.com/results/ppv/full.php?ppvres=1129|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023902/http://www.tnawrestling.com/results/ppv/full.php?ppvres=1129|archivedate=September 30, 2007|title=TNA Final Resolution 2007 Results|date=January 15, 2001|quote=After the long list, Backlund had decided that the contest would be ruled as a draw.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backlund then began to make regular appearances on ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]''. During this time, he was described as crazy and weird by commentators [[Don West (sportscaster)|Don West]] and [[Mike Tenay]], somewhat similar to the "Mr. Backlund" gimmick of his second WWF tenure.

Backlund made his in-ring return at [[Slammiversary (2007)|Slammiversary]], where he defeated Alex Shelley. He then teamed with [[Jerry Lynn]] to lose to [[Motor City Machine Guns|Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin]] (managed by Kevin Nash) at [[Victory Road (2007)|Victory Road]]. When TNA redesigned their website, Backlund's profile was removed, signaling the end of his run with the company.

=== Second return to WWE (2007–2017)===
On the [[List of WWE Raw special episodes|15th Anniversary episode of ''Raw'']] on December 10, 2007, Backlund participated in the 15th Anniversary [[Professional wrestling battle royal|battle royal]], along with 14 other wrestlers from ''Raw'''s 15-year history. Backlund was eliminated from the match by [[Steve Keirn|Skinner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/071210.html|title=WWE RAW RESULTS|author=|date=2007|website=OnlineWorldofWrestling.com|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the July 9, 2012 episode of ''Raw'', after [[Heath Slater]]'s match with [[Místico|Sin Cara]], Slater issued a challenge to any "past champion" as part of a weekly series of [[List of WWE personnel#WWE Legends|Legend]] appearances. Backlund emerged from backstage to answer this challenge and, as Backlund entertained the crowd, Slater kicked him in the stomach and mocked him; Backlund responded by putting Slater in the crossface chickenwing, which he refused to break for 20 seconds after Slater had [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Tap out|tapped out]]. He later appeared on ''[[WWE Raw 1000|Raw 1000]]'' with all of the other Legends who had faced Slater over prior weeks, helping Lita chase Slater back into the ring when he tried to run away from [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] and the [[Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]].

Backlund was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 6, 2013 by his friend [[Maria Menounos]], and was acknowledged onstage with the year's other inductees at [[WrestleMania 29]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wweppvs/article_69830.shtml CALDWELL'S WWE WRESTLEMANIA 29 PPV RESULTS, from PWTorch.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Backlund made an appearance on the October 7, 2013 episode of ''Raw'', unsuccessfully attempting to canvass votes in order to become the special guest referee for the WWE Championship match at [[Hell in a Cell (2013)|Hell in a Cell]]; [[Shawn Michaels]] later won a public vote and was named as the special guest referee. However, Backlund did appear in a segment at Hell in a Cell together with [[The Prime Time Players]], where they played ''[[WWE 2K14]]''. Since April 2014, he has served as an ambassador for WWE.&lt;ref name=Ambassador&gt;{{cite web|last=Cadwell|first=James|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_77782.shtml#.VCh27mddV8E|title=WWE NEWS: Raw script leak - several roster updates, including injuries, time off, heel or face?, Zayn call-up?, more|accessdate=September 28, 2014|date=October 20, 2014|publisher=PWTorch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the May 5, 2016 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'', Backlund would be approached by [[Darren Young]], who asked Backlund to be his life coach, at which Backlund agreed, vowing to "[[Make America Great Again|Make Darren Young Great Again]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2638646-bob-backlund-talks-possible-wwe-in-ring-return-brock-lesnar-hulk-hogan-more|title=Bob Backlund possible coach of Darren Young|last=Wood|first=Donald|date=May 11, 2016|website=[[The Bleacher Report]]|access-date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several months, various vignettes featuring Young and Backlund aired, with Backlund assuming the role of Young's [[Lifestyle guru|life coach]]. In a "life lesson" segment on the July 4 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', Backlund approved of Young adopting his famous [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface chickenwing|Crossface chickenwing]].{{cn|date=October 2017}} On the July 11 episode of ''Raw'', Young would win a battle royal to become the number one contender for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]]. At [[Battleground (2016)|Battleground]], Young faced [[The Miz]] in a match that resulted in a [[Countout|double-countout]] after he applied the Crossface Chickenwing to Miz outside the ring to protect Backlund from Miz and [[Maryse Ouellet|Maryse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7/24 WWE Battleground Results – Caldwell's Complete Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/07/24/jcbattlegroundppvreport/|website=PWTorch.com|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 19 at the [[2016 WWE draft]], Backlund and Young were drafted to ''Raw''. In early 2017, after Young got injured, Backlund ceased appearing on TV. On October 29, 2017, Young was released from WWE, ending the storyline. Backlund's profile on WWE.com was then moved to the [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] page shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/superstars|title=The Official Destination for WWE Superstars - WWE|work=[[WWE|WWE.com]]|accessdate=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BugMeNot''' is an [[internet]] service that provides [[username]]s and [[password]]s to let Internet users bypass mandatory free registration on [[website]]s. It was started in August 2003 by an anonymous person, later revealed to be Guy King,&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Tardos (October 8, 2007) ''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/the-brains-behind-bugmenot/2007/10/08/1191695798003.html Revealed: the brains behind Bugmenot]'', Sydney Morning Herald, Fairfax, Accessed 2007-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed Internet users to access websites that have registration walls (for instance, that of ''[[The New York Times]]'') with the requirement of compulsory registration. This came in response to the increasing number of websites that request such registration, which many Internet users find to be an annoyance and a potential source of [[spam (e-mail)|spam]] [[e-mail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2004/07/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-login/|title=We don't need no stinkin' login|website=Wired.com|date=20 July 2004|first=Rachel |last=Metz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the service==
BugMeNot allows users of their service to add new accounts for sites with free registration. It also encourages users to use [[disposable email address]] services to create such accounts. However, it does not allow them to add accounts for pay websites, as this could potentially  lead to [[credit card fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;Frequently Asked Questions - Bugmenot.com. . URL:{{cite web |url=http://www.bugmenot.com/faq.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HsAALCNT?url=http://www.bugmenot.com/faq.php |archivedate=July 5, 2013 |df= }}. Accessed: 2013-07-04. (Archived by WebCite® at )&lt;/ref&gt; BugMeNot also claims to remove accounts for any website requesting that they do not provide accounts for non-registered users.

To help make access to their service easier, BugMeNot hosts a [[bookmarklet]] that can be used with any browser to automatically find a usable account from their service. They also host extensions for the [[web browser]]s [[Mozilla Firefox]] (but not on Firefox quantum yet), [[Internet Explorer]], and [[Google Chrome]] (the extensions were created by Eric Hamiter with Dmytri Kleiner and Dean Wilson, respectively). There are also implementations in the form of a BugMeNot [[Opera Widgets|Opera widget]], or [[Features of the Opera web browser#User JavaScript|UserJS]] scripts along with buttons, which makes it fully browser-integrated. An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] application is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bug Me Not for Android|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aboutmycode.bugmenot|work=BugMeNot on Google Play}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:BugMeNot website.png|250px|right|thumb|The original BugMeNot website.]]

=== Opting out ===

BugMeNot provides an option for site owners to block their site from the BugMeNot database, if they match one or more of the following criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Block A Site |url=http://bugmenot.com/report.php |website=Bugmenot.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013081605/http://bugmenot.com/report.php |archivedate=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A community site where users register to change content, but not to view it (example : [[Wikipedia]])
* The site is pay-per-view
* There is a fraud risk associated with the site due to accounts containing private financial information

No option is provided for users to request removing a block if a site ceases to meet the blocking criteria or has never met them in the first place.

Site blocking can be circumvented by BugMeNot users by publishing usernames and passwords under a similar, but different, domain name to which they apply. For example, the owners of the domain abc.def.com might request a block to be put in place, but this will not prevent users uploading access information under the name of def.abc.com. Since one domain owner cannot demand that another domain be blocked, the information remains and is accessible provided that BugMeNot users tacitly agree that def.abc.com in fact refers to abc.def.com.{{Original research inline|date=November 2013}} For example, Wikipedia logins are in the database under wikipedia.net because wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org have been banned under the first criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = wikipedia.net passwords - BugMeNot|url = http://bugmenot.com/view/wikipedia.net|website = bugmenot.com|accessdate = 2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporary shutdown and return ==
Nearly a year after it was created BugMeNot was shut down temporarily by their service provider (at that time) [[HostGator]]. The site's creator claimed BugMeNot's host was pressured by websites to shut them down, though Hostgator claimed that the BugMeNot site was repeatedly crashing their servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Metz|first= Rachel|url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/08/64676|title=BugMeNot Gets Booted, Restored|magazine= ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' |date=August 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BugMeNot domain was transferred briefly to another hosting company, dissidenthosting.com, but before the site was set up, it began to redirect visitors to web pages belonging to racist groups, without the knowledge or consent of the site's owner. BugMeNot moved again, to NearlyFreeSpeech.NET. BugMeNot's move to this provider, which also hosts a number of highly controversial sites, prompted BugMeNot's creator to say, "Personally, I don't care if I'm sharing a server with neo-Nazis. I might not agree with what they have to say, but the whole thing about freedom of speech is that people are free to speak."&lt;ref&gt;[[Xeni Jardin|Jardin, Xeni]]. "[http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/20/bugmenotcom_returns_.html Bugmenot.com returns, spokesbugperson says some news sites trying to block it] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040831033223/http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/20/bugmenotcom_returns_.html |date=August 31, 2004 }}". ''[[Boing Boing]]''. August 20, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after BugMeNot returned, reports surfaced that some news sites had begun to attempt to block accounts posted on BugMeNot, though the extent and effectiveness of such efforts, as well as compliance with BugMeNot's Terms of Use,&lt;ref&gt;BugMeNot. "[http://www.bugmenot.com/terms.php Terms of Use]". Accessed April 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; are not known.

==RetailMeNot==
The operators of BugMeNot expanded the "MeNot" network in October, 2006 with the addition of [[RetailMeNot]] - a service for finding and sharing online coupon codes.  Users can add coupons they have found through any method, as well as a description of the coupon and an expiration date. Users can also scan in printed coupons and upload them for others to print.

'''''Cook Islands Shipping Co Ltd v Colson Builders Ltd''''' [1975] 1 NZLR 422 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding performance of an existing contractual duty to a promisor in [[economic duress]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case reinforces the English case of [[Stilk v Myrick]] (1809) 2 Camp 317; 170 ER 1168

==Background==
In 1971, Colson Builders were building a new hangar for Air New Zealand in Rarotonga in the Cook Islands. For the build, they needed 1,800 tons of building materials to be shipped from Portland Oregon, consisting mainly of cement and steel.

CIS quoted $4,463 for the shipping of the 158 tons of the steel required for the project, which CIS had quoted by using a "deadweight" basis. However, the steel for the project was prefabricated sections, which were far more bulky than plain flat steel, and so more onerous to the shipper, and so informed Colson that they would need to pay $13,265.39 for the freight.

==Held==
The court held that the increased price was economic duress, and so not legally enforceable.

'''Eric''' was the first British robot, built in 1928 by First World War veteran Captain William Richards, and aircraft engineer Alan Reffell. He was constructed to open the Exhibition of the Society of Model Engineers at London's [[Royal Horticultural Hall]] in 1928, after [[George VI]] (then the Duke of York) cancelled and an exasperated Richards, the exhibition's secretary, offered to "make a man of tin" to take the Duke's place.&lt;ref name="riskin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riskin|first1=Jessica|title=The Restless Clock: A History of the Centuries-Long Argument Over What Makes Living Things Tick|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226302928|page=301|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fUmGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA301|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the event's opening, Eric rose to his feet, bowed and gave a four-minute opening address.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knapton|first1=Sarah|title=Britain’s first robot ‘Eric’ to rise again after lost plans found|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/05/10/britains-first-robot-eric-to-rise-again-after-lost-plans-found/|accessdate=7 March 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The robot was operated by two people,&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|title=English Robot Adds Lecture To Repertoire|url=http://cyberneticzoo.com/robots/1928-eric-robot-capt-richards-english/|work=Chronicle Telegram|date=26 Nov 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and Eric's voice was received live by a radio signal,&lt;ref name="riskin"/&gt; Richards claiming to be working under a license of the [[Marconi Company]].&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt; Although able to sit and stand, Eric could not move his legs to walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Aluminium "Man" That Rises, Bows, And Makes A "Speech": A Knight-Like Robot|url=http://cyberneticzoo.com/robots/1928-eric-robot-capt-richards-english/|work=Illustrated London News|date=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; His chest bore the letters "R.U.R.", a reference to the robot manufacturer in [[Karel Čapek]]'s 1920 [[R.U.R.|play of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Will|last2=Kaplan|first2=Steven|title=The Image of Technology in Literature, the Media, and Society: Selected Papers from the 1994 Conference [of The] Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Social Imagery|publisher=The Society|page=3|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XFnRzHhbgCcC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his first appearance, Eric was taken on a US tour, introducing himself to an audience in New York in 1929&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaut|first1=Scott|title=Robots of Westinghouse, 1924-today|publisher=Scott Schautt, Mansfield Memorial Museum|isbn=9780978584412|page=61|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QU9GAAAAYAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "Eric the robot, the man without a soul".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Robot" Is A Mystery|url=http://cyberneticzoo.com/robots/1928-eric-robot-capt-richards-english/|work=Evening Tribune|date=29 Jan 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Press]]'' described him as "the perfect man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jozuka|first1=Emiko|title=The Sad Story of Eric, the UK's First Robot Who Was Loved Then Forsaken - Motherboard|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-sad-story-of-eric-the-uks-first-robot-who-was-loved-then-forsaken|website=Motherboard|accessdate=7 March 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after this, Eric disappeared.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; Having researched Eric's story, [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] curator Ben Russell concluded that "no-one quite knows what happened to him, whether he was blown-up or taken to pieces for spare parts".&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

In 2016, the London Science Museum raised funds through a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to rebuild Eric, working from archive material including ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' photographs. Eric was added to the museum's permanent collection, and appeared as part of a 2017 robots exhibition.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

==George==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09312, Berlin, Roboter mit seinem Erfinder.jpg|thumb|George, a later model of Eric, taking breakfast with his inventor William Richards in Berlin, 1930]]
In the 1930s, William Richards built a similar robot called "George", which toured the world including Germany and Australia. George could deliver speeches in French, German, Hindustani, Chinese and Danish. He cost almost £2,000 to build, compared to Eric's £140, and ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper described him as "the educated gentleman, alongside his rough-hewn awkward brother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet Mr. Robot - Not Forgetting His Master|url=http://cyberneticzoo.com/robots/1932-%E2%80%93-george-robot-%E2%80%93-capt-w-h-richards-british/|accessdate=7 March 2017|work=The Age|date=20 September 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the letters has been a matter of some controversy, to which a number of interpretations have been offered. The motto is believed an [[acronym]] of:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fpQlBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=Foedere+et+Religione+Tenemur&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja7IG0sLDaAhUDKMAKHV56CXsQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Foedere%20et%20Religione%20Tenemur&amp;f=false|title=Ulwencreutz's The Royal Families in Europe V|last=Ulwencreutz|first=Lars|date=November 2013|publisher=Lulu.com|year=|isbn=9781304581358|location=|pages=293|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Fortitudo Eius Rhodum Tenuit'' (Latin: "His strength conquered Rhodes" or "By his bravery he held [or occupied] Rhodes"), referring to the victory of [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]] (1249&amp;ndash;1323), who fought against the [[Saracens]] at the [[1315 siege of Rhodes]];&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or either

*''Fides Est Regni Tutela'' (Latin: "Faith is the protector of [our] Kingdom").

It has also been suggested that the letters are actually the [[Latin]] word ''[[Wiktionary:fert|fert]]'' (third-person singular present active indicative of ''ferre''), meaning "[he/she/it] suffers/bears", possibly referring to [[Jesus]] bearing the [[sin]]s of the world.

'''Friedrichswerder Church''' ({{lang-de|Friedrichswerdersche Kirche}}, {{lang-fr|Temple du Werder}}) was the first [[Gothic Revival|Neo-Gothic]] church built in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It was designed by an architect better known for his [[Neoclassical architecture]], [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]], and was built under his direction, 1824-1831.

The building is maintained by the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] and is part of [[Berlin State Museums]]' ensemble.&lt;ref name=SMB /&gt; In late 2012, the building was closed indefinitely, owing to structural damage suffered from nearby building activity.&lt;ref name="Stimmann2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stimmann|first1=Hans|title=Einstürzende Altbauten|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/hans-stimmann-ueber-die-friedrichswerdersche-kirche-14154295.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2|accessdate=8 July 2016|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|date=3 April 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously it held [[Berlin National Gallery]]'s collection of nineteenth-century German sculpture, showing works of [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]], Karl Friedrich Schinkel and [[Christian Daniel Rauch]], among others.

{{Anthropology}}
'''George Peter ("Pete") Murdock''' (May 11, 1897 – March 29, 1985), also known as '''G. P. Murdock''', was an American [[anthropologist]]. He is remembered for his empirical approach to ethnological studies and his study of family and kinship structures across differing cultures.

==Early life==
Born in [[Meriden, Connecticut]] to a family that had farmed there for five generations, Murdock spent many childhood hours working on the family farm and acquired a wide knowledge of traditional, non-mechanized, farming methods. He graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, in 1915 and earned a BA in American History at [[Yale University]]. He then attended [[Harvard Law School]], but quit in his second year and took a long trip around the world. This trip, combined with his interest in traditional material culture, and perhaps a bit of inspiration from the popular Yale teacher [[Albert Galloway Keller|A.G. Keller]], prompted Murdock to study anthropology at Yale. Yale's anthropology program still maintained something of the evolutionary tradition of [[William Graham Sumner]], a quite different emphasis from the [[historical particularism]] promulgated by [[Franz Boas]] at [[Columbia University|Columbia]]. In 1925, he received his doctorate and continued at Yale as a faculty member and chair of the anthropology department.&lt;ref&gt;Whiting 1986: 682–683&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in his earliest writings, Murdock's distinctive approach is apparent. He advocates an empirical approach to anthropology, through the compilation of data from independent cultures, and then testing hypotheses by subjecting the data to the appropriate statistical tests. He also sees himself as a social scientist rather than more narrowly as an anthropologist, and is in constant dialogue with researchers in other disciplines. At Yale, he assembled a team of colleagues and employees in an effort to create a cross-cultural [[data set]].&lt;ref&gt;Whiting 1986: 683–684&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing that a cross-cultural approach would help the U.S. war effort during World War II, Murdock and a few colleagues enlisted in the Navy and wrote handbooks on the cultures of [[Micronesia]], working out of an office at [[Columbia University]]. After completing the handbooks, Murdock and his fellow officers were sent to the Pacific as military government officials, serving for nearly a year in the administration of occupied [[Okinawa]]. While his pre-war fieldwork had been among the [[Haida people|Haida]] and other indigenous peoples of the Northwest North American coast, Murdock's interests were now focused on Micronesia, and he conducted fieldwork there episodically until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Whiting 1986: 684&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yale==
Murdock joined the faculty of Yale University in 1928. His PhD from the institution was in the field of Sociology, as Yale at that time did not yet have a Department of Anthropology. Murdock taught courses in [[physical anthropology]]. In 1931, Yale established an anthropology department and hired [[Edward Sapir]] as the chairman. Murdock's sociological and positivist approach to anthropology was at odds with Sapir's Boasian approach to cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Darnell, R. (1998), Camelot at Yale: The Construction and Dismantling of the Sapirian Synthesis, 1931-39. American Anthropologist, 100: 361–372.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Sapir's death, Murdock served as chairman of the Department of Anthropology from 1938 until 1960, when he reached the then mandatory retirement age at Yale. However, he was offered the chair of Andrew Mellon Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh. Leaving his long-time residence at 960 Ridge Road in Hamden, Connecticut, Murdock moved with his wife to 4150 Bigelow Boulevard in Pittsburgh.  He taught at the University of Pittsburgh until his retirement in 1973, at which point he moved to the Philadelphia area to be close to his son.

Murdock and his wife had one child, Robert Douglas Murdock.  He was born in 1929 and died in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', July 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bob and Jean Murdock had three children, Nancy and Karen (born 1955) and Douglas (born 1959). 

For Murdock's war service in World War II, the best source is his own account as published in ''A Twenty-Five Year Record: Yale College Class of 1919'', a class yearbook published in New Haven, Connecticut in 1946.  These are Murdock's own recollections, as shared with his classmates in the class of 1919 at Yale:  
 
{{quote|Before war struck, I was preoccupied with the routines of academic life at Yale—teaching and research with their modest rewards, departmental administration with its headaches, pleasant extra-curricular associations with my colleagues.  The principal thrill was to observe (and participate in) the gradual upsurge by which Yale came to assume unquestioned leadership in the social sciences. [. . .]  I wrote a little, imbibed a little, played some tennis, arbitrated a motion picture dispute, and instituted a fairly ambitious project called the Cross-Cultural Survey but dubbed by the New York Times a 'bank of knowledge.'  Then came Pearl Harbor, the explosions of which reverberated even in academic halls.  Through my chairmanship of the Oceania committee of the National Research Council I helped mobilize the country's anthropologists in the war effort.  On the advice of the intelligence experts of the Army and Navy I converted the Cross-Cultural Survey into a fact-gathering organization on the Japanese-held islands of the Pacific.  For the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs I organized and ran the Strategic Index of the Americas, a similar fact-gathering unit.  Like so many of my colleagues I spent a good bit of my time running back and forth to Washington.  Early in 1943, when the military program in the Pacific began to accelerate, the Navy Department urged me to speed up the research of the Cross-Cultural Survey and made a very generous offer of financial support.  They urged me even more strongly, however, to give up my other commitments, to come into the Navy with my associates, and to do the job 'on the inside.'  I said, 'Yes,' and within a week received a lieutenant commander's commission. [. . .]  After a month of informal indoctrination at the Office of the Naval Intelligence in Washington I was assigned to the staff of the Naval School of Military Government at Columbia University.  Here for fifteen months I managed a research unit at Yale which assembled all available information on the Pacific islands held by the Japanese, operated a second unit at Columbia which organized the information into a series of nine handbooks, and gave a course on the Pacific to military government officers.  The last handbook, on the Ryukyu Islands, was (providentially) published just when it was decided to invade Okinawa, and I was sent out to Hawaii to join the staff of the Tenth Army in planning that operation.  The planning complete, I was sent out to Okinawa as a military government officer. [. . .]

For two months, helped by one language officer, my job was to induce or drag the terror-stricken natives out of their mountain fastnesses into the coastal villages where we could house and feed them, give them medical attention, and get them back to a normal peace-time economy. [. . .]   Like millions of my compatriots I have seen at first hand the heroism, cowardice, monotony, resourcefulness, inefficiency, and frustration of which war is compounded.  [. . .]  I was transferred to the headquarters of military government for Okinawa and the adjacent islands, being placed in charge first of political affairs and then of all civilian affairs, social and economic as well as political.  My principal task was to organize an island-wide civilian council and to establish uniform local government throughout the area, during the course of which I organized and supervised two general elections.  During this period my contacts were largely with the political, professional, and business leaders among the Okinawans.  
[. . .] By early October the pull for home was very strong, and I left Okinawa on a task force bound for Norfolk.  We stopped en route for three or four days each at Singapore, Colombo, and Cape Town, where we were welcomed by the residents and wined and dined by the Royal Navy.  Having completed a circuit of the world, I rejoined my family on December 7.}}

According to [[David Price (anthropologist)|David H. Price]], in a chapter entitled "Hoover's Informer", devoted to Murdock during [[McCarthyism]], Murdock had secretly informed on AAA colleagues to [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. Murdock was particularly antagonistic of Boasian cultural anthropology, which he considered to be aligned with communist thought. Murdock was not the only person in his field or at his university to cooperate with intelligence agencies.  For much of the 20th century, agencies such as the CIA and the FBI enjoyed a close relationship with American universities.  Yale University was especially known (later) as a breeding ground for employees of the agencies.  Researchers in anthropology and foreign relations were often debriefed after foreign field trips (see: Robin W. Winks, Cloak and Gown: Scholars in the Secret War, 1939–1961.  New York: William Morrow, 1987). Murdock later served as chair of the American Anthropological Association's (AAA's) Committee on Scientific Freedom, established to defend anthropologists from unfair attacks.

In 1948, Murdock decided that his cross-cultural data set would be more valuable were it available to researchers at schools other than Yale. He approached the [[Social Science Research Council]] and obtained the funding to establish an inter-university organization, the [[Human Relations Area Files]], with collections maintained at Yale University (Whiting 1986: 684).

==Major works==
In 1954, Murdock published a list of every known culture, the ''Outline of World Cultures''. In 1957, he published his first cross-cultural data set, the ''World Ethnographic Sample'', consisting of 565 cultures coded for 30 variables. In 1959, despite having no professional experience in Africa, Murdock published ''Africa: Its peoples and their culture history'', a very useful reference book on African ethnic groups which also broke new ground in the analysis of prehistory, especially the domestication of plants. There is also a list of his other major works:
* ''Correlations of Matrilineal and Patrilineal Institutions.'' // G. P. Murdock (ed.) Studies in the Science of Society, New Haven: Yale, 1937.
* ''Social Structure.'' New York: The MacMillan Company. 1949.
* ''Ethnographic Atlas: A Summary.'' Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press. 1967.
* ''Standard Cross-Cultural Sample'' // Ethnology 8 (4): 329-69. 1969.
* ''Atlas of World Cultures.'' Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press. 1981.

==University of Pittsburgh==

In 1960, Murdock moved to the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he occupied the Andrew Mellon Chair of Anthropology. In 1971, he was instrumental in founding the [[Society For Cross-Cultural Research]], a scholarly society composed primarily of anthropologists and psychologists (Whiting 1986: 685). Between 1962 and 1967, he published installments of his ''Ethnographic Atlas'' in the journal ''Ethnology''—a data set eventually containing almost 1,200 cultures coded for over 100 variables.  In 1969, together with [[Douglas R. White]], he developed the [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]], consisting of a carefully selected set of 186 well-documented cultures that today are coded for about 2000 variables (Whiting 1986: 685). At the end of his career, he felt "no hesitation in rejecting the validity and utility of the entire body of anthropological theory, including the bulk of my own work...consigning it to the realm of mythology [not] science" as in "anthropology there's virtually no [...] consensus" on "the essential core of its body of theory."&lt;ref name="Proceedings"&gt;Anthropology's Mythology, George Peter Murdock
Proceedings of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, No. 1971 (1971), pp. 17-24&lt;/ref&gt;

After his retirement from Pitt, Murdock moved to the Philadelphia area to be close to his son and grandchildren.  He is buried in a military cemetery, Valley Forge Memorial Gardens, 352 South Gulph Road, King of Prussia, PA.

==Ethnology==
In 1962, Murdock founded [http://www.pitt.edu/~ethnolog ''Ethnology'' An International Journal of Cultural and Social Anthropology], published by the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Publication ended in 2012 owing to a lack of interest from the faculty of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh. Journal staff was released shortly thereafter, and offices were permanently repurposed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pitt.edu/~ethnolog/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Contributions==

Murdock is known most of all for his main sequence theory whose gist was spelled out by him initially as follows: "When any social system which has attained equilibrium begins to change, such change regularly begins with modification of the rule of residence. Alteration in residence rules is followed by development or change in form of descent consistent with residence rules. Finally adaptive changes in kinship terminology follow (Murdock 1949:221-222)."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11790">Many '''Japanese words of Portuguese origin''' entered the [[Japanese language]] when [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Jesuit]] priests introduced Christian ideas, Western science, technology and new products to the Japanese during the [[Muromachi period]] (15th and 16th centuries).  

The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] were the first Europeans to reach Japan and the first to establish direct trade between Japan and [[Europe]], in 1542. During the 16th and 17th century, Portuguese [[Jesuits]] had undertaken a great work of [[Catechism]], that ended only with religious persecution in the early [[Edo period]] (Tokugawa Shogunate). The Portuguese were the first to translate Japanese to a Western language, in the ''[[Nippo Jisho]]'' dictionary ({{nihongo|日葡辞書}}, literally the "Japanese-Portuguese Dictionary") or "Vocabulario da Lingoa de Iapam" compiled by Portuguese Jesuit [[João Rodrigues (missionary)|João Rodrigues]], and published in Nagasaki in 1603, who also wrote a grammar "[[Arte da Lingoa de Iapam]]" {{nihongo||日本大文典||nihon daibunten}}. The dictionary of Japanese-Portuguese explained 32,000 Japanese words translated into Portuguese. Most of these words refer to the products and customs that first came to Japan via the Portuguese traders.

==List of loanwords==
Many of the first words which were introduced and entered the Japanese language from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Japanese words of Dutch origin|Dutch]] are written in ''[[kanji]]'' or ''[[hiragana]],'' rather than ''[[katakana]]'', which is the more common way to write loanwords in Japanese in modern times.  ''Kanji'' versions of the words are ''[[ateji]]'', characters that are "fitted" or "applied" to the words by the Japanese, based on either the pronunciation or the meaning of the word.

The '''†''' indicates the word is archaic and no longer in use.

==Arigatō==

{{wiktionary|ありがとう}}

It is often suggested that the Japanese word ''arigatō'' derives from the Portuguese ''obrigado'', both of which mean "Thank you", but evidence clearly indicates a purely Japanese origin. The Japanese phrase ''arigatō gozaimasu'' is a polite form of ''arigatō''. This is a form of an adjective, ''arigatai'', for which written records exist dating back to the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' compiled circa 759 AD, well before Japanese contact with Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linguistlist.org/issues/12/12-1871.html LINGUIST List 12.1871, Sun Jul 22 2001 Sum: Origins of Arigato]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The full derivation is ''arigatō'', the “u” sound change of  ''arigataku'' &lt; ''arigataku'', the attributive form of arigatai, &lt; ''arigatai'' &lt; ''arigatashi'' &lt; ''ari'' + ''katashi''. ''Ari'' is a verb meaning "to be" and ''katashi'' is an adjective meaning "difficult". The original meaning of "arigatashi" was "difficult to be", i.e. that the listener's generosity or behavior is "rare" and thus "special".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3732">'''Hostile prejudice''' is the outward expression of hate for people of a different [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[religion]], [[ideology]], country, [[sex]], [[sexual orientation]], or [[gender identity]]. Anyone who goes against specific criteria of dress, cultural or moral beliefs, or religious or political ideologies are subject to hostile [[racism]]. This racism often leads to direct [[discrimination]] to anyone who does not fit the [[prejudice]]d person's idea of a "normal" person. This behavior is most prevalent when there are noticeable differences between [[ingroups and outgroups]], with the outgroup members experiencing hostile prejudice from ingroup members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.491 |title=The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory: Differentiating hostile and benevolent sexism |year=1996 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=491–512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Most research done on hostile prejudice has been done on hostile [[sexism]]. Peter Glick and [[Susan Fiske]], along with several other colleagues, did a study on hostile and [[benevolent sexism]] across cultures. Glick and his colleagues found that hostile sexism and benevolent sexism are consistent notions that have a positive relationship to each other across nations.&lt;ref name="Glick et al 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.763 |title=Beyond prejudice as simple antipathy: Hostile and benevolent sexism across cultures |year=2000 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |last3=Mladinic |first3=Antonio |last4=Saiz |first4=José L. |last5=Abrams |first5=Dominic |last6=Masser |first6=Barbara |last7=Adetoun |first7=Bolanle |last8=Osagie |first8=Johnstone E. |last9=Akande |first9=Adebowale |last10=Alao |first10=Amos |last11=Brunner |first11=Barbara |last12=Willemsen |first12=Tineke M. |last13=Chipeta |first13=Kettie |last14=Dardenne |first14=Benoit |last15=Dijksterhuis |first15=Ap |last16=Wigboldus |first16=Daniel |last17=Eckes |first17=Thomas |last18=Six-Materna |first18=Iris |last19=Expósito |first19=Francisca |last20=Moya |first20=Miguel |last21=Foddy |first21=Margaret |last22=Kim |first22=Hyun-Jeong |last23=Lameiras |first23=Maria |last24=Sotelo |first24=Maria José |last25=Mucchi-Faina |first25=Angelica |last26=Romani |first26=Myrna |last27=Sakalli |first27=Nuray |last28=Udegbe |first28=Bola |last29=Yamamoto |first29=Mariko |last30=Ui |first30=Miyoko  |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=763–75 |pmid=11079240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women and men are viewed by hostile sexism as opposites in that women try to control men by domesticated means (e.g., [[marriage]], demands for attention, and material possessions), forcing men to attempt to hang on to their independence and keep their [[masculinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Bernard E. |last1=Whitley |first2=Mary E. |last2=Kite |year=2010 |title=The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-81128-2}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glick and colleagues found that, if sexism in a culture is high overall, then women will tend to reject hostile sexism over benevolent sexism when it comes to men.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15720">'''Irish genealogy''' is the study of individuals and/or families who originated on the island of [[Ireland]].

==Origins==

[[Genealogy]] was cultivated since at least the start of the early Irish historic era. Upon [[inauguration]], [[Bards]] and poets are believed to have recited the ancestry of an inaugurated king to emphasise his [[hereditary]] right to rule. With the transition to written culture, oral history was preserved in the monastic settlements. [[Dáibhí Ó Cróinín]] believed that [[Gaels|Gaelic]] genealogies came to be written down with or soon after the practise of annalistic records, annals been kept by monks to determine the yearly [[chronology]] of [[feast days]] (see [[Irish annals]]).

Its cultivation reached a height during the Late Medieval Era with works such as ''[[Leabhar Ua Maine]]'', ''[[Senchus fer n-Alban]]'', ''[[Book of Ballymote]]'', ''De Shíl Chonairi Móir'', ''[[Book of Leinster]]'', ''[[Leabhar Cloinne Maoil Ruanaidh]]'' and the ''[[Ó Cléirigh Book of Genealogies]]''. This tradition of scholarship reached its [[zenith]] with ''[[Leabhar na nGenealach]]'', composed mainly between 1649–1650 in [[Galway]].

Genealogy had at first served a purely serious purpose in determining the legal rights of related individuals to land and goods. Under [[Brehon Laws|Fenechas]], ownership of land was determined by [[Agnatic seniority|Agnatic succession]], female ownership being severely limited.

Over time, genealogy was pursued for its own merits by the Gaelic learned classes. From c. 1100, various families such as [[Ó Cléirigh]], [[Mac Fhirbhisigh]], [[Ó Duibhgeannáin]], [[Mac Aodhagáin]] and [[Mac an Bhaird]] became professional historians. They were often employed by ruling families, the most important of whom included [[O'Conor Don|Ó Conchobhair]], [[O'Neill dynasty|Ó Neill]], [[O'Donnell dynasty|Ó Domhnaill]], [[Clan Kelly|Ó Cellaigh]], [[Kavanagh (surname)|Mac Murchadha Caomhánach]], [[MacCarthy dynasty|Mac Carthaigh]], [[O'Brien dynasty|Ó Briain]], [[McLoughlin|Ó Mael Sechlainn]], [[Fitzpatrick (name)|Mac Giolla Padraig]]. It also became pervasive among the [[Anglo-Irish]], with the recording of the family trees of [[FitzGerald dynasty|FitzGerald]], [[Butler]], [[Burke (surname)|Burke]], [[Plunkett]], Nugent, [[Bermingham]] and others.

Some clans, such as [[Mac Fhirbhisigh]] and [[Ó Duibhgeannáin]] were originally hereditary [[ecclesiastical]] families, while others ([[Ó Cléirigh]], [[Mac an Bhaird]], [[Donnellan (disambiguation)|Ó Domhnallain]]) were dispossessed royalty who were forced to find another profession (see also [[Irish medical families]]).

The transmission of this body of [[Folklore|lore]] (''seanchas'') has resulted in detailed knowledge on the origins and history of many of the tribes and families of Ireland. An anglicised tradition has continued since the 17th-century, translating many of the scripts into English. The practise of genealogy continues to be of importance among the Irish and its [[diaspora]]. Historians (such as [[Dáibhí Ó Cróinín]] and [[Nollaig Ó Muraíle]]) consider the Irish genealogical tradition to have the largest national corpus in Europe.

==The Irish Genealogical Doctrine==

Over the course of several centuries, an evolving [[genealogical]] [[dogma]] created by the [[bard]]ic viewed all Irish as descendants of [[Milesius|Míl Espáine]]. This ignored variant traditions, including those recorded in their own works. The reasons behind the doctrine's adoption is rooted in the policies of dynastic and political propaganda.

The [[doctrine]] dates from the 10th–12th centuries, as demonstrated in the works of Eochaid ua Flainn (936–1004); [[Flann Mainistrech]] (died 25 November 1056); Tanaide (died c. 1075); and [[Gilla Cómáin mac Gilla Samthainde]] (fl. 1072). Many of their compositions were incorporated into the compendium [[Lebor Gabála Érenn]].

It was enhanced and embedded in the tradition by successive  generations of historians such as [[Seán Mór Ó Dubhagáin]] (d.1372), Gilla Íosa MacFhirbhisigh (fl. 1390–1418) and Flann Mac Aodhagáin (alive 1640). By 1600 it was refined to the point that certain [[Anglo-Irish]] families were given spurious Gaelic ancestors and origin legends, such was their immersion in Gaelic culture.

The first Irish historian who questioned the reliability of such accounts was [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]] (murdered 1671), whose massive [[Leabhar na nGenealach]] included disparate and variant recensions. Unlike [[Geoffrey Keating]] ''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn'', he did not attempt to synthesise the material into a unified whole, instead recording and transmitting it unaltered. However, historians as late as such as [[Eugene O'Curry]] (1794–1862) and [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] (1806–1861) sometimes accepted the doctrine and a nationalistic interpretation of Irish history uncritically. During the 20th century the doctrine was reinterpreted by the work of historians such as [[Eoin MacNeill]], [[T. F. O'Rahilly]], [[Francis John Byrne]], [[Kathleen Hughes (historian)]], and [[Kenneth Nicholls]].

'''Jane's Information Group''' (often referred to as '''Jane's''') is a British publishing company specialising in military, aerospace and transportation topics. It was acquired in 2007 by [[IHS Inc.]], and its [[open-source intelligence]] databases and publications continue to be produced under the IHS Jane's and IHS brands.

==History==
{{refimprove|date=September 2015}}
Jane's was founded in 1898 by [[Fred T. Jane]] who had begun sketching ships as an enthusiast naval artist while living in [[Portsmouth]]. This gradually developed into an encyclopaedic knowledge, culminating in the publishing of [[Jane's Fighting Ships|''All the World's Fighting Ships'']] (1898).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brooks |first=Richard |title=Fred T Jane: An Eccentric Visionary |year=1997 |publisher=Jane's Information Group |location=Coulsdon, Surrey, England |isbn=0710617518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company then gradually branched out into other arenas of military expertise. The books and trade magazines published by the company are often considered the ''de facto'' public source of information on warfare and transportation systems.

Based in London for most of its existence, Jane's Information Group was acquired by [[IHS Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Press release]] (12 June 2007).  [http://www.ihs.com/News/Press-Releases/2007/IHSacquiresJanesInformationGroup.htm "IHS Acquires Jane's Information Group&amp;nbsp;–Move Creates Global Powerhouse for Aerospace, Defense and Security Insight and Analysis"], IHS.com. Retrieved 4 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in June 2007, having previously been owned by [[The Woodbridge Company]] and before that the [[Thomson Corporation]] for a number of years. Major periodical competitors include ''[[Defense News]]'', ''[[Flight International]]'', ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]'' and the Shephard Group. The company continues to provide [[open-source intelligence]] in the defence, security, aerospace and transportation sectors.

== Early life and education ==

Jean Blackwell Hutson was born in [[Summerfield, Florida|Sommerfield, Florida]] and moved to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] with her mother in 1918.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; She graduated valedictorian from [[Frederick Douglass High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Frederic Douglass High Schoo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l in 1929.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Jean continued her education at the [[University of Michigan–Flint|University of Michigan]], studying [[psychiatry]], and transferred to [[Barnard College]], where she graduated with an English degree, [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1935. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In 1936, Ms. Hutson received her Master's degree in [[Library science|Library Science]] from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; She also acquired her teaching certificate from [[Columbia University]] in 1941. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Ms. Hutson was married twice, to  [[Andy Razaf]] 1939-1947&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and John Hutson 1952-1957. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; She had a daughter, Jean Frances Hutson. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Career ==
Through the social and cultural prejudices against people of color and women, common at the time, Jean Blackwell Hutson made great gains in her professional career. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; From 1936 to 1984, she worked at multiple branches of the [[New York Public Library]] system, &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; with a brief period as a school librarian at [[Paul Laurence Dunbar High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Paul Lawrence Dunbar High Schoo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her most notable professional position was as curator and chief of the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]] &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; during which time she developed the Schomburg Dictionary Catalog. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The collection at the Schomburg Center grew under her guidance to become, "a major source for research on Black history and culture". &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

With a personal invitation from [[Kwame Nkrumah]], Hutson was asked to assist in Ghana with the development and creation of the African Collection.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/asa-news/article/jean-blackwell-hutson-19141998/C4047719B9D2313D9BA640C7749C8680|title=Jean Blackwell Hutson, 1914-1998|last=Easterbrook|first=David L.|date=14 July 2016|website=Cambridge Core|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took the opportunity to move to Ghana and spent the years of 1964-1965 at the University at Ghana.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Hutson retired in 1980 but still remained active.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; She was still actively involved in organizations such as Information Science in the 1980s. She served on the Task Force on Library and Information Services to Cultural Minorities of the National Commission on Libraries.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; During her retirement she wrote a chapter on the Schomburg Center in Black Bibliophiles and Collectors: Preservers of Black History.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12209">This is a '''list of [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]] and [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]] acronyms'''.

This list is far from complete; you can help by expanding it.

==Sorting order==

The entries in each section are sorted according to the Hebrew alphabet. Prefixes indicating prepositions and articles (such as ב, ד, ה, ש, כ) have been removed, with the following exceptions: 
*Where the acronym is incomprehensible or meaningless without the prefix
*Where the prefix is so integral to the acronym that variants without it rarely, if ever, occur

==Numeronyms==

Some abbreviations included here are actually [[gematria]] ([[Hebrew]] [[numeronyms]]), but the number is so closely associated with some noun that it is grammatically used as a noun and is synonymous with it, for example ב"ן, Ban. Other abbreviations contain a variable gematria component alongside other words, like the chapter references פי"א perek yud-alef (chapter 11) or פ"ט perek tet (chapter 9). Rather than list separate entries for every possible gematria, or use only one number for an example, the gematria component is replaced with [x] to produce (for example) [x]"פ.

==Hebrew acronyms==

Some Hebrew acronyms are not included here; they may be found in the [[List of Hebrew acronyms]].

Many of the abbreviations here are similar or identical to corresponding Hebrew acronyms. In fact, a work written in [[Aramaic]] may have Hebrew acronyms interspersed throughout (ex. [[Talmud]], [[Midrash]]), much as a Hebrew work may borrow from Aramaic (ex. [[Tanya]]).

This is a '''list of [[film archives]] and [[cinematheque]]s'''. Film archives collect, restore, investigate and conserve audiovisual content like films, documentaries, television programs and newsreel footage. Often, every country has its own film archive to preserve the national audiovisual heritage. The [[International Federation of Film Archives]] comprises more than 150 institutions in over 77 countries and the [[Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques]] is an affiliation of 44 European national and regional film archives founded in 1991.

A '''monogram''' is a [[motif (art)|motif]] made by overlapping or combining two or more letters or other [[grapheme]]s to form one [[symbol]]. Monograms are often made by combining the initials of an individual or a company, used as recognizable symbols or [[logo]]s. A series of uncombined initials is properly referred to as a cypher (e.g. a [[royal cypher]]) and is not a monogram.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]] (Fifth edition; 2002) defines it as a "device composed of two or more letters... interwoven together." Volume 1, p. 1820.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer Monogramm.svg|thumb|left|100px|The "AD" monogram that [[Albrecht Dürer]] used as a signature]]
Monograms first appeared on coins, as early as 350BC. The earliest known examples are of the names of Greek cities which issued the coins, often the first two letters of the city's name. For example, the monogram of [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaea]] consisted of the letters [[alpha]] (Α) and [[chi (letter)|chi]] (Χ) joined together.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Noel Humphreys, ''The Coin Collector's Manual, Or Guide to Numismatic Student in the Formation of a Cabinet of Coins'' (Bibliolife, 2008), 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monograms have been used as signatures by artists and [[Artisan|craftsmen]] on paintings, sculptures and pieces of furniture, especially when [[guilds]] enforced measures against unauthorized participation in the trade. A famous example of a monogram serving as an artist's signature is the "AD" used by [[Albrecht Dürer]].

==Christograms==
{{Main|Christogram}}
[[File:Sarcophage de Drausin 03 chrisme.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The [[Chi-Rho]], a monogram of the first two letters of the Greek word for [[Christ]]]]

Over the centuries, monograms of the name of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] have been used as [[Christian symbolism|Christian symbols]]. The [[IX monogram]] consists of the initial Greek letters of the name "Jesus Christ," "I" for Ιησούς, ([[Jesus]] in Greek) and "X" for Χριστος ([[Christ]] in Greek). The "IHS" Christogram, denoting the first three letters of the Greek name of Jesus, is usually written as a cypher, but sometimes as a monogram. Perhaps the most significant [[Christogram]] is the [[Chi Rho]], formed from the first two letters of Χριστος.

==Royal monograms==

[[File:Signum manus of Charlemagne.svg|thumb|upright|Cross-signature of [[Charlemagne]] ]]
[[Signum manus]] (sometimes also known as ''Chrismon'') refers to the medieval practice, current from the [[Merovingian period]] until the 14th century in the [[Frankish Empire]] and its successors, of signing a document or charter with a special type of monogram or royal cypher.

[[File:Christian VII AR Speciedaler 79001450.jpg|thumb|right|Speciedaler of [[Denmark]], bearing the double C7 monogram of [[Christian VII of Denmark|Christian VII]]]]
Monograms of the names of [[monarch]]s are used as part of the insignia of public organizations in kingdoms, such as on police badges. This indicates a connection to the ruler. However, the [[royal cypher]], so familiar on [[pillar box]]es, is not technically a monogram, since the letters are not combined.

Royal monograms often appear on coins, frequently surmounted by a crown. Countries that have employed this device in the past include  [[Bulgaria]], [[Great Britain]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]] and many [[List of historic states of Germany|German states]]. Today, several [[Danish krone|Danish coins]] carry the monogram of [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]], while the current Norwegian 1 [[Norwegian krone|Krone coin]] has the "H5" monogram of [[Harald V of Norway|Harald V]] on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norges-bank.no/templates/article____12369.aspx Coins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203082931/http://www.norges-bank.no/templates/article____12369.aspx |date=2011-02-03 }}, at the [[Norges Bank]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; The only countries using the [[Euro]] to have a royal monogram as their [[Identifying marks on euro coins|national identifying mark]] are [[Belgian euro coins|Belgium]] and [[Monegasque euro coins|Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;A [[€2 commemorative coins|commemorative €2 coin]] from [[Luxembourgish euro coins|Luxembourg]] carried the monogram of [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke Henri]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, royal monograms appear on the individual flag for each major royal family member.

==Individual monograms==
[[File:Dress shirt monogram locations.svg|thumb|Dress shirt monogram locations]]

An individual's monogram is often a very fancy piece of art used for stationery, for adorning luggage, for embroidery on clothing, and so forth. These monograms may have two or three letters.

A basic 3-letter monogram has the initial of the individual's last name (surname) set larger, or with some special treatment in the center, while the first name initial appears to the left of it and the middle name initial appears to the right of it. There is a difference in how this is written for men and women. For example, if the individual's name is Mary Ann Jones, and Jones is the surname, then the arrangement of letters would be thus: '''M&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt;A''', with the surname initial set larger in the center, the '''M''' for Mary to the left and the '''A''' for Ann to the right.&lt;ref name="3LM"&gt;Jeanine Twigg, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j6e847_n3MUC&amp;pg=PA43 Embroidery Machine Essentials: How to Stabilize, Hoop and Stitch Decorative Designs]'', KP Craft, 2001, {{ISBN|0-87341-999-5}}, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, individual monograms for men&lt;ref&gt;https://www.simplystamps.com/blog/2016/06/30/monogram-guide-how-to/&lt;/ref&gt; are based on the order of the name. The name Kyle George Martin would be written ('''KGM''').

Married or engaged couples may use two-letter monograms of their entwined initials, for example on [[wedding invitations]]. Married couples may also create three-letter monograms incorporating the initial of their shared surname. For example, the monogram '''M&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt;A''' might be used for Michael and Alice Jones.&lt;ref name="3LM"/&gt; However, monogramming etiquette for the married couple varies according to the item being monogrammed. Linens, for example, typically list the woman's given initial first, followed by the couple's shared surname initial and then the man's given initial ('''A&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt;M''').&lt;ref name="What is a Monogram"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is a Monogram?|url = http://www.homewetbar.com/blog/what-is-monogram/|accessdate = 2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monograms can often be found on custom dress shirts where they can be located in a number of different positions.

Some personal monograms have become famous symbols in their own right and instantly recognizable to many, such as [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s monogram.

==Other monograms==
[[File:UT&amp;T text logo.svg|thumb|110px|left|The [[University of Texas at Austin|UT]] monogram]]

{{see also|Logo}}
Some companies and organizations adopt a monogram for a logo, usually with the letters of their [[acronym]]. For example, as well as having an official [[Seal (emblem)|seal]], and the [[Texas Longhorns]] logo, the [[University of Texas at Austin]] uses a "UT" monogram (in the same color as the Longhorns logo, [[burnt orange]]). The [[New York Yankees]] baseball team also uses a monogram on their [[ball cap]] insignia. &lt;!-- (I'm commenting out this bit because it makes no sense. If you can explain, please do. Thanks!)  and French [[soccer]] team [[Olympique de Marseille]] use a monogram taken from in funder. --&gt; The [[Consolidated Edison]] logo, with a rounded "E" nested inside a "C," has been described as a "classic emblem."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek|BusinessWeek]] online, [http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/aug2005/id20050811_494381.htm Con Ed: The Power of a Logo], 11 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fashion companies have a monogram for a logo, including [[Louis Vuitton]] and [[Fendi]]. The connected "CC" company logo, created by [[Coco Chanel]], is one of the most recognizable monograms internationally.&lt;ref name="What is a Monogram"/&gt;

Athletes have also been known to brand merchandise with their monogram logo; notably [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Roger Federer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brubach|first1=Holly|title=The Main Characters of Tennis, and Style|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/sports/tennis/31logo.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=21 August 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance symbols in wartime ==
[[File:Kotwica symbol.svg|thumb|60px|''Polska Walcząca'' - "Fighting Poland"]]

A notable example of a royal monogram is the [[H7 (monogram)|H7]] monogram of King [[Haakon VII of Norway]]. While in exile during [[World War II]], Haakon VII spearheaded the Norwegian resistance to the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|German occupation]], and H7 became a symbol used by the Norwegian populace to mark solidarity and loyalty to the King, and adherence to the [[Norwegian resistance movement]]. The act of drawing or creating a H7 symbol in German-occupied Norway was punishable by imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meldinger fra Norge|last=Hjeltnes|first=Guri|authorlink=Guri Hjeltnes|date=7 April 2008|work=VG|pages=2|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, during [[World War II]] in Poland, the "PW" monogram was used as a resistance symbol, known as ''The Anchor'', or [[Kotwica]] due to its characteristic shape. Its meaning varied, as the initials were useful for many different slogans, such as ''Poland Fights'', ''Warsaw Uprising'', ''Polish Army'' and others. Like the Norwegian example above, its use was punished by the Nazi occupation authorities.

==Japanese==
{{main|Japanese rebus monogram}}
A Japanese rebus monogram is a monogram in a particular style, which spells a name via a [[rebus]], as a form of [[Japanese wordplay]] or [[visual pun]]. Today they are most often seen in corporate logos or product logos.

'''''Nanjung Ilgi''''' or '''''War Diary of Yi Sun-sin''''' is the personal diary of [[Admiral]] [[Yi Sun-sin]] ([[Hangul]]: 이순신, [[Hanja]]: 李舜臣), a Korean naval commander who lived during the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. It was written between January 1, 1592 and November 17, 1598, a first person narrative of the admiral's perspective on the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598)|Japanese invasions of Korea in the late 16th century]].

It is the 76th [[National treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]] and listed in [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World]] registry.

==Contents==

The original ''Nanjung Ilgi'' consists of 205 folio pages divided into 7 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ha|first1=Tae-hung|title=Nanjung Ilgi: War Diary of Admiral Yi Sun-sin|date=1977|publisher=Yonsei University Press|location=Seoul, South Korea|isbn=8971410183|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entries detail the admiral's daily life in a military camp, his strategies, his naval campaigns, the names and dispositions of various military officers and civil officials with whom Admiral Yi interacted, geographic and atmospheric details, and his personal observations and commentary on the events and circumstances of his military command. These entries are not continuous: there are breaks in the narrative throughout the diary, representative of periods of time in which Admiral Yi was unable to maintain daily entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ha|first1=Tae-hung|title=Nanjung Ilgi: War Diary of Admiral Yi Sun-sin|date=1977|publisher=Yonsei University Press|location=Seoul, South Korea|isbn=8971410183|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some overlap between Volumes 5 and 6, where Admiral Yi apparently later revised earlier entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ha|first1=Tae-hung|title=Nanjung Ilgi: War Diary of Admiral Yi Sun-sin|date=1977|publisher=Yonsei University Press|location=Seoul, South Korea|isbn=8971410183|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47501">:''This article discusses the historical roots of Judaism throughout the 1st millennium BCE. For the origins of the modern-day religion of Judaism, see [[Origins of Rabbinic Judaism]].''

The '''origins of Judaism''' lie in the [[Bronze Age]] amidst polytheistic [[ancient Semitic religion]]s, specifically [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite religion]], co-existing with a syncretization with elements of [[Babylonian religion]] and of the worship of [[Yahweh]] reflected in the early [[Nevi'im|prophetic books]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. During the [[Iron Age I]], the Israelite religion became distinct from other Canaanite religions due to the unique [[monolatristic]] (proto-monotheistic) worship of [[Yahweh]].

During the [[Babylonian captivity]] of the 6th and 5th centuries BCE ([[Iron Age II]]), certain circles within the [[Kingdom of Judah|exiled Judahites]] in Babylon refined pre-existing ideas about [[monotheism]], [[Chosen people|election]], [[divine law]] and [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]] into a strict monotheistic theology which came to dominate the former [[Kingdom of Judah]] in the following centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBSJNDndGjwC&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel|last=Gnuse|first=Robert Karl|year=1997|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|isbn=1-85075-657-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 5th century BCE until 70 CE, [[Israelites|Israelite]] religion developed into the various theological schools of [[Second Temple Judaism]], besides [[Hellenistic Judaism]] in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]]. Second Temple [[Jewish eschatology|eschatology]] was significantly influenced by [[Zoroastrianism]]. The text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] was [[redaction|redacted]] into its extant form in this period and possibly also [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|canonized as well]].

[[Rabbinic Judaism]] developed during [[Late Antiquity]], during the 3rd to 6th centuries CE; the [[Masoretic Text]] of the Hebrew Bible and the [[Talmud]] were compiled in this period. The oldest manuscripts of the Masoretic tradition come from the 10th and 11th centuries CE; in the form of the [[Aleppo Codex]] of the later portions of the 10th century CE and the [[Leningrad Codex]] dated to 1008–1009 CE. Due largely to censoring and the burning of manuscripts in medieval Europe the oldest existing manuscripts of various [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinical works]] are quite late. The oldest surviving complete manuscript copy of the [[Babylonian Talmud]] is dated to 1342 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Golb|first=Norman|title=The Jews in Medieval Normandy: A Social and Intellectual History|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521580328|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QErKNTFrZnkC&amp;pg=PA530&amp;lpg=PA530&amp;dq=%22Babylonian+Talmud%22+1342&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rUiMSCRxK1&amp;sig=HDLMJHrfoXi1OrJ7HaZUoMUHjeY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CiUyUIPCGMWb1AXk8IDgDA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Babylonian%20Talmud%22%201342&amp;f=false|page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{See also|History of Judaism}}
[[Judaism]] has its origins in the Iron Age [[Kingdom of Judah]] and in [[Second Temple Judaism]].{{sfn|Neusner|1992|p=3}} It has three essential and related elements: study of the written [[Torah]] (the books of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Deuteronomy]]); the recognition of [[Israelites|Israel]] (defined as the descendants of [[Abraham]] through his grandson [[Jacob]]) as a people elected by God as recipients of the law at Mount Sinai, his [[chosen people]]; and the requirement that Israel live in accordance with God's laws as given in the Torah.{{sfn|Neusner|1992|p=3}}

==Monarchic period Yahwism==
{{Main|Yahweh}}
The Iron Age kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel (or Samaria)]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] first appear in the 9th century BCE.{{sfn|Schniedewind|2013|p=93}}{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=119}} The two kingdoms shared [[Yahweh]] as their national god, for which reason their religion is commonly called Yahwism.{{sfn|Hackett|2001|p=156}} Neighbouring kingdoms of the time each had their own national gods: [[Chemosh]] was the god of [[Moab]], [[Moloch]] the god of the [[Ammon]]ites, [[Qaus]] the god of the [[Edom]]ites, and so on, and in each kingdom the king was his god's [[viceroy]] on Earth.{{sfn|Hackett|2001|p=156}}{{sfn|Davies|2010|p=112}}{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=90}} The various [[national god]]s were more or less equal, reflecting the fact that kingdoms themselves were more or less equal, and within each kingdom a divine couple, made up of the national god and his consort – Yahweh and the goddess [[Asherah]] in Israel and Judah – headed a pantheon of lesser gods.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=119}}{{sfn|Anderson|2015|p=3}}{{sfn|Betz|2000|p=917}}

By the late 8th century both Judah and Israel had become vassals of [[Assyria]], bound by treaties of loyalty on one side and protection on the other. Israel rebelled and was destroyed c. 722&amp;nbsp;BCE, and refugees from the former kingdom fled to Judah, bringing with them the tradition that Yahweh, already known in Judah, was not merely the most important of the gods, but the only god who should be served. This outlook was taken up by the Judahite landowning elite, who became extremely powerful in court circles in the next century when they placed the eight-year-old [[Josiah]] (reigned 641–609 BC) on the throne. During Josiah's reign Assyrian power suddenly collapsed, and a pro-independence movement took power promoting both the independence of Judah from foreign overlords and loyalty to Yahweh as the sole god of Israel. With Josiah's support the "Yahweh-alone" movement launched a full-scale reform of worship, including a covenant (i.e., treaty) between Judah and Yahweh, replacing that between Judah and Assyria.{{sfn|Rogerson|2003|p=153-154}}

By the time this occurred, Yahweh had already been absorbing or superceding the positive characteristics of the other gods and goddesses of the pantheon, a process of appropriation that was an essential step in the subsequent emergence of one of Judaism's most notable features, its uncompromising [[monotheism]].{{sfn|Anderson|2015|p=3}} The people of ancient Israel and Judah, however, were not followers of Judaism: they were practitioners of a polytheistic culture worshiping multiple gods, concerned with fertility and local shrines and legends, and not with a written [[Torah]], elaborate laws governing ritual purity, or an exclusive covenant and national god.{{sfn|Davies|2016|p=15}}

==Second Temple Judaism==
{{main article|Second Temple Judaism}}
{{further|Hellenistic Judaism|YHWH}}

In 586 BCE Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians, and the Judean elite – royal family, the priests, the scribes and other members of the elite – were taken to Babylon in captivity. They represented only a minority of the population, and Judah, after recovering from the immediate impact of war, continued to have a life not much different from what had gone before. In 539 BCE Babylon fell to the Persians and the [[Babylonian exile]] ended and a number of the exiles, but by no means all and probably a minority, returned to Jerusalem. They were the descendants of the original exiles, and had never lived in Judah; nevertheless, in the view of the authors of the Biblical literature, they, and not those who had remained in the land, were "Israel".{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=397}} Judah, now called Yehud, was a Persian province, and the returnees, with their Persian connections in Babylon, were in control of it. They represented also the descendants of the old "Yahweh-alone" movement, but the religion they instituted was significantly different from both monarchic Yahwism{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=402}} and modern Judaism. These differences include new concepts of priesthood, a new focus on written law and thus on scripture, and a concern with preserving purity by prohibiting intermarriage outside the community of this new "Israel".{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=402}} 

The Yahweh-alone party returned to Jerusalem after the Persian conquest of Babylon and became the ruling elite of Yehud. Much of the Hebrew Bible was assembled, revised and edited by them in the 5th century BCE, including the [[Torah]] (the books of [[book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Deuteronomy]]), the historical works, and much of the prophetic and [[Wisdom]] literature.{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|Perkins|2007|p=xxiii}}{{sfn|Berquist|2007|p=3-4}} The Bible narrates the discovery of a legal book in the Temple in the seventh century BCE, which the majority of scholars see as some form of Deuteronomy and regard as pivotal to the development of the scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEyD_MaeqP4C&amp;pg=PA61|title=The Blackwell Companion to Judaism|author=Frederick J. Murphy|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|others=Jacob Neusner,|isbn=978-0-470-75800-7|editor=Alan Avery-Peck|pages=61–|chapter=Second Temple Judaism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing collection of scriptures was translated into Greek in the Hellenistic period by the Jews of the Egyptian diaspora, while the Babylonian Jews produced the court tales of the [[Book of Daniel]] (chapters 1–6 of Daniel – chapters 7–12 were a later addition), and the books of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] and [[Book of Esther|Esther]].{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|Perkins|2007|p=xxvi}}

Other scholars{{Who|date=July 2013}} contend that the development of a strict monotheism was the result of [[Trans-cultural diffusion|cultural diffusion]] between Persians and Hebrews. While (in practice) dualistic, [[Zoroastrianism]] believed in eschatological monotheism (i.e. only one god in the end).  Some suggest that it is not merely coincidence that Zoroastrianism's model of eschatological monotheism and the [[Deuteronomist#Deuteronomistic history|Deuteronomic historians']] strictly monotheistic model receive formative articulations during the period after Persia overthrew Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/15283-zoroastrianism&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Second Temple Judaism]] was divided into theological factions, notably the [[Pharisees]] and the [[Sadducees]], besides numerous smaller sects such as the [[Essenes]], [[Jewish messianism|messianic movements]] such as [[Early Christianity]], and closely related traditions such as [[Samaritanism]] (which gives us the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], an important witness of the text of the Torah independent of the [[Masoretic Text]]).

During the 2nd to 1st centuries BCE, when Judea was under [[Seleucid]] and then [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, the genre of [[apocalyptic literature]] became popular, the most notable work in this tradition being the [[Book of Daniel]].

==Development of Rabbinic Judaism==

{{main article|Origins of Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic Judaism}}
{{further|Tannaim|Amoraim|Talmud|Origins of Christianity}}
For centuries, the traditional understanding has been that [[Judaism]] came before [[Christianity]] and that [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|Christianity separated from Judaism]] some time after the [[destruction of the Second Temple]] in 70 CE. Starting in the latter half of the 20th century, some scholars have begun to argue that the historical picture is quite a bit more complicated than that.{{sfn|Becker|Reed|2007}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jews and Christians: the parting of the ways A.D. 70 to 135|editor-last=Dunn|editor-first=James D. G.|publisher=William B Eerdmans Publishing Company|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zCh9SBb6Y8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jews+and+Christians:+The+Parting+of+the+Ways&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uayp6KFZkr&amp;sig=MnZ1wjNVicf0Og6Jw6mAwwXkioA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SG2GTPK-HYi8sAO1q6m6Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century, many Jewish sects existed in competition with each other, see [[Second Temple Judaism]]. The sects which eventually became [[Rabbinic Judaism]] and [[Early Christianity]] were but two of these. Some scholars have begun to propose a model which envisions a twin birth of Christianity and Judaism rather than a separation of the former from the latter. For example, Robert Goldenberg (2002) asserts that it is increasingly accepted among scholars that "at the end of the 1st century CE there were not yet two separate religions called "Judaism" and "Christianity"".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldenberg|first=Robert|title=Reviewed Work: ''Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism'' by Daniel Boyarin|journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume=92|issue=3/4|year=2002|pages=586–588|doi=10.2307/1455460|jstor=1455460}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Daniel Boyarin]] (2002) proposes a revised understanding of the interactions between nascent Christianity and nascent [[Rabbinical Judaism]] in [[Late Antiquity]] which views the two religions as intensely and complexly intertwined throughout this period.

The [[Amoraim]] were the Jewish scholars of [[Late Antiquity]] who codified and [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|commented upon]] the law and the biblical texts. The final phase of redaction of the Talmud into its final form took place during the 6th century CE, by the scholars known as the [[Savora]]im. This phase concludes the [[Chazal]] era foundational to Rabbinical Judaism.

[[File:PrintMus 038.jpg|thumb|220px|Printing]]

To '''publish''' is to make [[Content (media)|content]] available to the [[general public]].&lt;ref name="bc"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P98_14701 Berne Convention, article 3(3)]. URL last accessed 2010-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucc"&gt;[http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/The%20Universal%20Copyright%20Convention%20_Geneva%20Text--September.pdf Universal Copyright Convention, Geneva text (1952), article VI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125161930/http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/The%20Universal%20Copyright%20Convention%20_Geneva%20Text--September.pdf |date=2012-11-25 }}. URL last accessed 2010-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt; While specific use of the term may vary among countries, it is usually applied to text, images, or other [[audio-visual]] content, including paper ([[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[Mail-order catalog|catalog]]s, etc.). The word '''''publication''''' means the act of [[publishing]], and also refers to any printed copies.

==Legal definition and copyright==
"Publication" is a [[wikt:term of art|technical term]] in legal contexts and especially important in [[copyright law|copyright legislation]].  An author of a work generally is the initial owner of the [[copyright]] on the work. One of the copyrights granted to the author of a work is the exclusive right to publish the work.

In the [[United States]], publication is defined as:
:the distribution of copies or phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending. The offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of people for purposes of further distribution, public performance, or public display, constitutes publication. A public performance or display of a work does not of itself constitute publication.
:To perform or display a work "publicly" means &amp;ndash;
::(1) to perform or display it at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of people outside a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered; or
::(2) to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to a place specified by clause (1) or to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.
:&amp;mdash;[[:s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 1/Section 101#publication|17 USC 101]]

:The US Copyright Office provides further guidance in Circular 40 [http://copyright.gov/circs/circ40.pdf], which states: "When the work is reproduced in multiple copies, such as in reproductions of a painting or castings of a statue, the work is published when the reproductions are publicly distributed or offered to a group for further distribution or public display".

Generally, the right to publish a work is an exclusive right of copyright owner ([[:s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 1/Sections 105 and 106|17 USC 106]]), and violating this right (e.g. by disseminating copies of the work without the copyright owner's consent) is a [[copyright infringement]] ([[:s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 5/Section 501|17 USC 501(a)]]), and the copyright owner can demand (by suing in court) that e.g. copies distributed against his will be confiscated and destroyed ([[:s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 5/Sections 502 and 503|17 USC 502, 17 USC 503]]). Exceptions and limitations are written into copyright law, however; for example, the exclusive rights of the copyright owner eventually expire, and even when in force, they don't extend to publications covered by [[fair use]] or certain types of uses by libraries and educational institutions.

The definition of "publication" as "distribution of copies to the general public with the consent of the author" is also supported by the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], which makes mention of "copies" in article 3(3), where "published works" are defined.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt; In the [[Universal Copyright Convention]], "publication" is defined in article VI as "the reproduction in tangible form and the general distribution to the public of copies of a work from which it can be read or otherwise visually perceived."&lt;ref name="ucc"/&gt; Many countries around the world follow this definition, although some make some exceptions for particular kinds of works. In Germany, §6 of the ''Urheberrechtsgesetz'' additionally considers works of the visual arts (such as sculptures) "published" if they have been made permanently accessible by the general public (i.e., erecting a sculpture on public grounds is publication in Germany).&lt;ref name="de"&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/urhg/__6.html German UrhG, §6], in German. URL last accessed 2007-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and the UK (as the U.S.) do not have this exception and generally require the distribution of copies necessary for publication. In the case of sculptures, the copies must be even three-dimensional.&lt;ref name="au"&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/bodylodgmentattachments/62632B5B1514AEB0CA2570DC000DF45C?OpenDocument#para2.454 Australian Copyright Act, section 29: Publication]. URL last accessed 2007-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uk"&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_11.htm#mdiv175 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c. 48), section 175], [[Copyright law of the United Kingdom]].

==Biological classification==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}
In [[biological classification]] ([[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]), the ''publication'' of the description of a [[taxon]] has to comply with some rules. The definition of the "publication" is defined in [[nomenclature codes]]. Traditionally there were the following rules:
*The publication must be generally available.
*The date of publication is the date the published material became generally available.

[[Electronic publication]] with some restrictions is permitted for publication of scientific names of fungi since 1 January 2013.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawksworth | first1 = D. L.  | year = 2011 | title = A new dawn for the naming of fungi: impacts of decisions made in Melbourne in July 2011 on the future publication and regulation of fungal names | url = | journal = [[MycoKeys]] | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 7–20 | doi = 10.3897/mycokeys.1.2062 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{expand section|date=September 2016}}

===Material types===
There is an enormous variety of material types of publication, some of which are:
*[[Book]]: Pages attached together between two covers, to allow a person to read from or write in.
*[[Breaking News|Bulletin]]: Information written in short on a flyer or inside another publication for public viewing.  Bulletins are also brief messages or announcements broadcast to a wide audience by way of TV, radio, or internet.
*[[Book]]let: Leaflet of more than one sheet of paper, usually attached in the style of a book.
*[[Broadside (printing)|Broadside]]: A large single sheet of paper printed on one side, designed to be plastered onto walls. Produced from 16th - 19th cent. Became obsolete with the development of newspapers and cheap novels.
*[[Flyer (pamphlet)|Flyer]] or handbill: A small sheet of paper printed on one side, designed to be handed out free
*[[Folded leaflet|Leaflet]]: Single sheet of paper printed on both sides and folded.
*[[Diary|Journal]]: A book with blank pages inside, to allow you to write down any personal information.  Another word for a newspaper or similar publication.
*[[Newsletter]]: A bulletin, leaflet, pamphlet, or newspaper distributed to a specific audience. 
*[[Newspaper]]: A publication of several pages printed with news, sports, information, and advertising. Newspapers may be published and distributed daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually. 
*[[Magazine]]: A book with front and back paper covers, printed with information and advertising.  Some magazines are published and distributed every week or every month.
*[[Pamphlet]]: Can be a leaflet, booklet or saddle-stapled booklet.

==== Electronic publishing ====
{{Main article|Electronic publishing}}
[[File:Internet_map_1024.jpg|thumb|330px|Internet Map Visualization]] Electronic publishing (also referred to as e-publishing or digital publishing or online publishing) includes the digital publication of e-books, digital magazines, and the development of digital libraries and catalogues. Electronic publishing has become common. It is also becoming common to distribute books, magazines, and newspapers to consumers through digital devices, by online sources.
[[File:Moody Hall computer lab.jpg|thumb|left|Modern computing and networking have revolutionized publishing.]]
[[File:Computer server rack.jpg|thumb|center|Server rack, delivering data to inquiries.]]

===Content types===
Types of publication can also be distinguished by content:
* [[Brochure]]: an informative document made for advertising products or services, usually in the form of a pamphlet or leaflet.
* [[Tract (literature)|Tract]]: a religious or political argument written by one person and designed to be distributed free, usually in the form of a booklet or pamphlet, but sometimes longer.
* [[Monograph]]: a long research publication written by one person.

==Unpublished works==
A work that has not undergone publication, and thus is not generally available to the public, or for [[citation]] in scholarly or legal contexts, is called an '''unpublished work'''. In some cases unpublished works are widely cited, or circulated via informal means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/henrichsenl/apa/APA14.html |title=APA REFERENCE STYLE: Unpublished Sources |work=linguistics.byu.edu |year=2002 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[author]] who has not yet published a work may also be referred to as being unpublished.

The status of being unpublished has specific significance in the legal context, where it may refer to the [[non-publication of legal opinions in the United States]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20369">The [[science fiction]] writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]] (1907–1988) was productive during a writing career that spanned the last 49 years of his life; the '''Robert A. Heinlein bibliography''' includes 32 novels, 59 short stories and 16 collections published during his life. Four films, two TV series, several episodes of a radio series, and a board game derive more or less directly from his work. He wrote a screenplay for one of the films. Heinlein edited an anthology of other writers' SF short stories.

Three non-fiction books and two poems have been published posthumously. [[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs|One novel]] has been published posthumously and [[Variable Star|another]], an unusual collaboration, was published in 2006. &lt;!-- Linked by indirection so that the two posthumous novels aren't given excessive prominence --&gt;  Four collections have been published posthumously.

Heinlein's fictional works can be found in the library under PS3515.E288, or under [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey]] 813.54.  Known pseudonyms include Anson MacDonald (7 times), Lyle Monroe (7), John Riverside (1), Caleb Saunders (1), and Simon York (1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/rahfaq.html|title=The Robert A.

==== Complete works ====

* The ''Virginia Edition,''  a 46-volume hardcover collection of all of Robert Heinlein's stories, novels, and nonfiction writing, plus a selection of his personal correspondence, was announced by [[Meisha Merlin Publishing]] in April 2005; the Robert A. and Virginia Heinlein Prize Trust (which now owns the Heinlein copyrights) instigated the project. Meisha Merlin went out of business in May 2007 after producing six volumes: ''[[I Will Fear No Evil]]'', ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs|For Us, the Living]]'', ''[[The Door into Summer]]'', and ''[[Double Star]]''.
* [[The Heinlein Prize Trust]] then decided to publish the edition itself, having formed the Virginia Edition Publishing Co. for this purpose. As was true for the Meisha Merlin effort, individual volumes are not offered; subscribers must purchase the entire 46-volume set. The final five volumes (including two volumes of screenwriting, both produced and unproduced) were shipped to subscribers in June 2012.
* In July 2007, the Heinlein Prize Trust opened the online Heinlein Archives, which allows people to purchase and download items from the Heinlein Archive previously stored at the University of California-Santa Cruz. The Trust makes grants available to those using the archives for scholarly purposes.

In November 2012, Rock in China rolled out Semantic Mediawiki and connected their database to the [[Open Linked Data Cloud]] featuring over 50000 data triplets.&lt;ref&gt;As per their Special:Semantic Statistics page, accessed March 13th 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The same month the page also extended their service to Music-China.org and included non-rock music specific content, including [[Chinese Opera]], classical music of China and [[Cantopop]]/[[Mandopop]].

In March 2013, Music-China.org started an academic online project with the aim to map the complete history of Chinese music.&lt;ref&gt;As per their blog entry: http://rockinchina.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/project-chinese-music-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1415">The '''Russian State Archive of Contemporary History (RGANI)''' ({{lang-ru|Российский государственный архив новейшей истории (РГАНИ)}}) is a large [[Russia]]n state [[archive]] managed by [[Rosarkhiv]], which preserves post-1952 documents of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. It was established in 1999 as the successor to the Center for Preservation of Contemporary Documentation (TsKhSD, {{lang-ru|Центр хранения современной документации (ЦХСД)}}), which acquired current records of the Communist Party nationalized after the failure of the [[Soviet coup attempt]] in 1991. A very large percentage of its files are still classified and many others are still difficult to access. In 1992 Soviet dissident [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] worked in the archive and secretly scanned copies of some documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/buk.html Soviet Archives] collected by Vladimir Bukovsky&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-1952 documents of the [[CPSU]] are collected in the [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35216">In [[computer science]], a '''tail call''' is a [[subroutine]] call performed as the final action of a procedure. If a tail call might lead to the same subroutine being called again later in the call chain, the subroutine is said to be '''tail-recursive''', which is a special case of [[recursion (computer science)|recursion]]. '''Tail recursion''' (or '''tail-end recursion''') is particularly useful, and often easy to handle in implementations.

Tail calls can be implemented without adding a new [[stack frame]] to the [[call stack]]. Most of the frame of the current procedure is no longer needed, and can be replaced by the frame of the tail call, modified as appropriate (similar to [[Overlay (operating system)|overlay]] for processes, but for function calls). The program can then [[jump (computer science)|jump]] to the called subroutine. Producing such code instead of a standard call sequence is called '''tail call elimination'''. Tail call elimination allows procedure calls in tail position to be implemented as efficiently as [[goto]] statements, thus allowing efficient [[structured programming]]. In the words of [[Guy L. Steele]], "in general, procedure calls may be usefully thought of as GOTO statements which also pass parameters, and can be uniformly coded as [machine code] JUMP instructions."&lt;ref name="aim-443" /&gt;

Not all programming languages require tail call elimination. However, in [[functional programming language]]s, tail call elimination is often guaranteed by the [[Programming language specification|language standard]], allowing tail recursion to use a similar amount of memory as an equivalent [[loop (computing)|loop]]. The special case of tail recursive calls, when a function calls itself, may be more amenable to call elimination than general tail calls. When the language semantics do not explicitly support general tail calls, a compiler can often still optimize '''sibling calls''', or tail calls to functions which take and return the same types as the caller.&lt;ref name="llvm.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://llvm.org/docs/CodeGenerator.html#sibling-call-optimization|title=The LLVM Target-Independent Code Generator — LLVM 7 documentation|website=llvm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
When a function is called, the computer must "remember" the place it was called from, the ''[[return address]]'', so that it can return to that location with the result once the call is complete. Typically, this information is saved on the [[call stack]], a simple list of return locations in order of the times that the call locations they describe were reached. For tail calls, there is no need to remember the caller &amp;ndash; instead, tail call elimination leaves the stack alone (except possibly for [[function argument]]s and [[local variable]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/7540/1037 |title=recursion - Stack memory usage for tail calls - Theoretical Computer Science |publisher=Cstheory.stackexchange.com |date=2011-07-29 |accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the newly-called function will return directly to the ''original'' caller. The tail call doesn't have to appear lexically after all other statements in the source code; it is only important that the calling function return immediately after the tail call, returning the tail call's result if any, since the calling function will never get a chance to do anything after the call if the optimization is performed.

For non-recursive function calls, this is usually an [[Program optimization|optimization]] that saves only a little time and space, since there are not that many different functions available to call. When dealing with recursive or [[mutually recursive]] functions where recursion happens through tail calls, however, the stack space and the number of returns saved can grow to be very significant, since a function can call itself, directly or indirectly, creating a new call stack frame each time. Tail call elimination often asymptotically reduces stack space requirements from linear, or [[Big-O notation|O]](n), to constant, or [[Big-O notation|O]](1). Tail call elimination is thus required by the standard definitions of some programming languages, such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]],&lt;ref name='SchemeProperTailRec'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs/r6rs-Z-H-8.html#node_sec_5.11 |title=Revised^6 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme |publisher=R6rs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-rationale/r6rs-rationale-Z-H-7.html#node_sec_5.3 |title=Revised^6 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme - Rationale |publisher=R6rs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and languages in the [[ML (programming language)|ML]] family among others. The Scheme language definition formalizes the intuitive notion of tail position exactly, by specifying which syntactic forms allow having results in tail context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs/r6rs-Z-H-14.html#node_sec_11.20 |title=Revised^6 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme |publisher=R6rs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementations allowing an unlimited number of tail calls to be active at the same moment, thanks to tail call elimination, can also be called 'properly tail-recursive'.&lt;ref name='SchemeProperTailRec' /&gt;

Besides space and execution efficiency, tail call elimination is important in the [[functional programming]] idiom known as [[continuation-passing style]] (CPS), which would otherwise quickly run out of stack space.

==Syntactic form==
A tail call can be located just before the syntactical end of a subroutine:
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
function foo(data) {
    a(data);
    return b(data);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, both &lt;code&gt;a(data)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b(data)&lt;/code&gt; are calls, but &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is the last thing the procedure executes before returning and is thus in tail position. However, not all tail calls are necessarily located at the syntactical end of a subroutine:

&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
function bar(data) {
    if ( a(data) ) {
        return b(data);
    }
    return c(data);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, both calls to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; are in tail position. This is because each of them lies in the end of if-branch respectively, even though the first one is not syntactically at the end of &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt;'s body.

In this code:
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
function foo1(data) {
    return a(data) + 1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
function foo2(data) {
    var ret = a(data);
    return ret;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
function foo3(data) {
    var ret = a(data);
    return (ret == 0) ? 1 : ret;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

the call to &lt;code&gt;a(data)&lt;/code&gt; is in tail position in &lt;code&gt;foo2&lt;/code&gt;, but it is '''not''' in tail position either in &lt;code&gt;foo1&lt;/code&gt; or in &lt;code&gt;foo3&lt;/code&gt;, because control must return to the caller to allow it to inspect or modify the return value before returning it.

==Example programs==
The following program is an example in [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]:&lt;ref name="sicp"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sussman|first1=G. J.|last2=Abelson|first2=Hal|title=Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs|date=1984|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-262-01077-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="scheme"&gt;
;; factorial : number -&gt; number
;; to calculate the product of all positive
;; integers less than or equal to n.
(define (factorial n)
 (if (= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
&lt;/source&gt;

This is not written in a tail recursion style, because the multiplication function ("*") is in the tail position. This can be compared to:

&lt;source lang="scheme"&gt;
;; factorial : number -&gt; number
;; to calculate the product of all positive
;; integers less than or equal to n.
(define (factorial n)
  (fact-iter 1 n))
(define (fact-iter product n)
  (if (&lt; n 2)
      product
      (fact-iter (* product n)
                 (- n 1))))
&lt;/source&gt;

This program assumes [[Evaluation strategy#Applicative order|applicative-order]] evaluation. The inner procedure &lt;code&gt;fact-iter&lt;/code&gt; calls itself ''last'' in the control flow. This allows an [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] or [[compiler]] to reorganize the execution which would ordinarily look like this:&lt;ref name="sicp" /&gt;

   call factorial (4)
    call fact-iter (1 4)
     call fact-iter (4 3)
      call fact-iter (12 2)
       call fact-iter (24 1)
       return 24
      return 24
     return 24
    return 24
   return 24

into the more [[Algorithmic efficiency|efficient]] variant, in terms of both space and time:

   call factorial (4)
    call fact-iter (1 4)
    replace arguments with (4 3)
    replace arguments with (12 2)
    replace arguments with (24 1)
    return 24
   return 24

This reorganization saves space because no state except for the calling function's address needs to be saved, either on the stack or on the heap, and the call stack frame for &lt;code&gt;fact-iter&lt;/code&gt; is reused for the intermediate results storage. This also means that the programmer need not worry about running out of stack or heap space for extremely deep recursions. In typical implementations, the tail recursive variant will be substantially faster than the other variant, but only by a constant factor.

Some programmers working in functional languages will rewrite recursive code to be tail-recursive so they can take advantage of this feature. This often requires addition of an "accumulator" argument (&lt;code&gt;product&lt;/code&gt; in the above example) to the function. In some cases (such as filtering lists) and in some languages, full tail recursion may require a function that was previously purely functional to be written such that it mutates references stored in other variables.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}&lt;!-- an example would be good here --&gt;

==Tail recursion modulo cons==
'''Tail recursion modulo cons''' is a generalization of tail recursion optimization introduced by [[David H. D. Warren]]&lt;ref&gt;D. H. D. Warren, ''DAI Research Report 141'', University of Edinburgh, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of [[compiler|compilation]] of [[Prolog]], seen as an ''explicitly'' [[Single assignment#Single assignment|''set once'']] language. It was described (though not named) by [[Daniel P. Friedman]] and [[David S. Wise]] in 1974&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Friedman and David S. Wise, [http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/techreports/TRNNN.cgi?trnum=TR19 ''Technical Report TR19: Unwinding Structured Recursions into Iterations''], Indiana University, Dec. 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[LISP]] compilation technique. As the name suggests, it applies when the only operation left to perform after a recursive call is to prepend a known value in front of a list returned from it (or to perform a constant number of simple data-constructing operations, in general). This call would thus be a ''tail call'' save for ("[[modulo (jargon)|modulo]]") the said ''[[cons]]'' operation. But prefixing a value at the start of a list ''on exit'' from a recursive call is the same as appending this value at the end of the growing list ''on entry'' into the recursive call, thus building the list as a [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]], as if in an implicit accumulator parameter. The following Prolog fragment illustrates the concept:	
===Prolog example===
{|
|-
|&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
% tail recursive modulo cons:
partition([], _, [], []).
partition([X|Xs], Pivot, [X|Rest], Bigs) :-
  X @&lt; Pivot, !,
  partition(Xs, Pivot, Rest, Bigs).
partition([X|Xs], Pivot, Smalls, [X|Rest]) :-
  partition(Xs, Pivot, Smalls, Rest).
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
-- In Haskell, guarded recursion:
partition :: Ord a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a -&gt; ([a],[a])
partition [] _ = ([],[])
partition (x:xs) p | x &lt; p     = (x:a,b)
                   | otherwise = (a,x:b)
   where
      (a,b) = partition xs p

&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
% With explicit unifications:
%     non-tail recursive translation:
partition([], _, [], []).
partition(L, Pivot, Smalls, Bigs) :- L=[X|Xs],
 (  X @&lt; Pivot
 -&gt; partition(Xs,Pivot,Rest,Bigs), Smalls=[X|Rest]
 ;  partition(Xs,Pivot,Smalls,Rest), Bigs=[X|Rest]
 ).
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
% With explicit unifications:
%     tail recursive translation:
partition([], _, [], []).
partition(L, Pivot, Smalls, Bigs) :- L=[X|Xs],
 (  X @&lt; Pivot
 -&gt; Smalls=[X|Rest], partition(Xs,Pivot,Rest,Bigs)
 ;  Bigs=[X|Rest], partition(Xs,Pivot,Smalls,Rest)
 ).

&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Thus in tail recursive translation such a call is transformed into first creating a new [[Node (computer science)|list node]] and setting its &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; field, and ''then'' making a tail call with the pointer to the node's &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt; field as argument, to be filled recursively.

===C example===
The following fragment defines a recursive function in [[C (programming language)|C]] that duplicates a linked list:
{|
|-valign="top"
|rowspan="2"|
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct list {void *value;struct list *next;};
typedef struct list list;

list *duplicate(const list *ls)
{
    list *head = NULL;

    if (ls != NULL) {
        list *p = duplicate(ls-&gt;next);
        head = malloc(sizeof *head);
        head-&gt;value = ls-&gt;value;
        head-&gt;next = p;
    }
    return head;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;source lang="scheme"&gt;
;; in Scheme,
(define (duplicate ls)
  (if (not (null? ls))
    (cons (car ls)
          (duplicate (cdr ls)))
    '()))
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
%% in Prolog,
dup([X|Xs],R):- 
  dup(Xs,Ys),
  R=[X|Ys].
dup([],[]).
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

In this form the function is not tail-recursive, because control returns to the caller after the recursive call duplicates the rest of the input list. Even if it were to allocate the ''head'' node before duplicating the rest, it would still need to plug in the result of the recursive call into the &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; field ''after'' the call.{{efn|Like this: 
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
if (ls != NULL) { 
  head = malloc( sizeof *head); 
  head-&gt;value = ls-&gt;value; 
  head-&gt;next = duplicate( ls-&gt;next); 
}&lt;/source&gt; 
}} 
So the function is ''almost'' tail-recursive. Warren's method pushes the responsibility of filling the &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; field into the recursive call itself, which thus becomes tail call:

{|
|-valign="top"
|rowspan="2"|
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct list {void *value;struct list *next;};
typedef struct list list;
void duplicate_aux(const list *ls, list *end);

list *duplicate(const list *ls)
{   
    list head;

    duplicate_aux(ls, &amp;head);
    return head.next;
}

void duplicate_aux(const list *ls, list *end)
{
    if (ls != NULL) {
        end-&gt;next = malloc(sizeof *end);
        end-&gt;next-&gt;value = ls-&gt;value;
        duplicate_aux(ls-&gt;next, end-&gt;next);
    } else {
        end-&gt;next = NULL;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;source lang="scheme"&gt;
;; in Scheme,
(define (duplicate ls)
  (let ((head (list 1)))
    (let dup ((ls  ls) 
              (end head))
      (cond 
        ((not (null? ls)) 
         (set-cdr! end (list (car ls)))
         (dup (cdr ls) (cdr end)))))
    (cdr head)))
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
%% in Prolog,
dup([X|Xs],R):-
   R=[X|Ys],
   dup(Xs,Ys).
dup([],[]).
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

(A sentinel head node is used to simplify the code.) The callee now appends to the end of the growing list, rather than have the caller prepend to the beginning of the returned list. The work is now done on the way ''forward'' from the list's start, ''before'' the recursive call which then proceeds further, instead of ''backward'' from the list's end, ''after'' the recursive call has returned its result. It is thus similar to the accumulating parameter technique, turning a recursive computation into an iterative one.

Characteristically for this technique, a parent [[call frame|frame]] is created on the execution call stack, which the tail-recursive callee which can reuse as its own call frame if the tail-call optimization is present.

The tail-recursive implementation can now be converted into an explicitly iterative form, as an accumulating [[Loop (computing)#Loops|loop]]:
{|
|-valign="top"
|rowspan="2"|
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct list {void *value;struct list *next;};
typedef struct list list;

list *duplicate(const list *ls)
{
    list head, *end;
    end = &amp;head;
    while (ls != NULL)
    {
        end-&gt;next        = malloc(sizeof *end);
        end-&gt;next-&gt;value = ls-&gt;value;
        ls = ls-&gt;next;
        end = end-&gt;next;
    }
    end-&gt;next = NULL;
    return head.next;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;source lang="scheme"&gt;
 ;; in Scheme,
 (define (duplicate ls)
   (let ((head (list 1)))
     (do ((end head (cdr end))
          (ls  ls   (cdr ls )))
         ((null? ls) (cdr head))
       (set-cdr! end (list (car ls))))))
&lt;/source&gt;
|-
|&lt;source lang="prolog"&gt;
%% in Prolog,
%% N/A
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

==History==
In a paper delivered to the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] conference in Seattle in 1977, [[Guy L. Steele]] summarized the debate over the [[GOTO]] and [[structured programming]], and observed that procedure calls in the tail position of a procedure can be best treated as a direct transfer of control to the called procedure, typically eliminating unnecessary stack manipulation operations.&lt;ref name="aim-443"&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1145/800179.810196|isbn=978-1-4503-2308-6|hdl=1721.1/5753|chapter=Debunking the “expensive procedure call” myth or, procedure call implementations considered harmful or, LAMBDA: The Ultimate GOTO|title=Proceedings of the 1977 annual conference on - ACM '77|year=1977|last1=Steele|first1=Guy Lewis|pages=153–162 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since such "tail calls" are very common in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], a language where procedure calls are ubiquitous, this form of optimization considerably reduces the cost of a procedure call compared to other implementations. Steele argued that poorly implemented procedure calls had led to an artificial perception that the GOTO was cheap compared to the procedure call. Steele further argued that "in general procedure calls may be usefully thought of as GOTO statements which also pass parameters, and can be uniformly coded as [machine code] JUMP instructions", with the machine code stack manipulation instructions "considered an optimization (rather than vice versa!)".&lt;ref name="aim-443"/&gt; Steele cited evidence that well optimized numerical algorithms in Lisp could execute faster than code produced by then-available commercial Fortran compilers because the cost of a procedure call in Lisp was much lower. In [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], a Lisp dialect developed by Steele with [[Gerald Jay Sussman]], tail call elimination is guaranteed to be implemented in any interpreter.&lt;ref name="r5rs"&gt;R5RS Sec. 3.5, {{Cite journal

==Implementation methods==
Tail recursion is important to some [[high-level programming language|high-level languages]], especially [[functional programming|functional]] and [[logic programming|logic]] languages and members of the [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] family. In these languages, tail recursion is the most commonly used way (and sometimes the only way available) of implementing iteration. The language specification of Scheme requires that tail calls are to be optimized so as not to grow the stack. Tail calls can be made explicitly in [[Perl]], with a variant of the "goto" statement that takes a function name: &lt;code&gt;goto &amp;NAME;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact details |url=http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/goto.html |title=goto |publisher=perldoc.perl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for language implementations which store function arguments and local variables on a [[call stack]] (which is the default implementation for many languages, at least on systems with a [[hardware stack]], such as the [[x86]]), implementing generalized tail call optimization presents an issue: if the size of the callee's activation record is different from that of the caller, then additional cleanup or resizing of the stack frame may be required. For these cases, optimizing tail recursion remains trivial, but general tail call optimization may be harder to implement efficiently.

For example, in the [[Java virtual machine]] (JVM), tail-recursive calls can be eliminated (as this reuses the existing call stack), but general tail calls cannot be (as this changes the call stack).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12045299/what-is-difference-between-tail-calls-and-tail-recursion What is difference between tail calls and tail recursion?]", ''Stack Overflow''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/157684/what-limitations-does-the-jvm-impose-on-tail-call-optimization What limitations does the JVM impose on tail-call optimization]", ''Programmers Stack Exchange''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, functional languages such as [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] that target the JVM can efficiently implement direct tail recursion, but not mutual tail recursion.

The [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]], [[Clang|LLVM/Clang]], and [[Intel C Compiler|Intel]] compiler suites perform tail call optimization for [[C (programming language)|C]] and other languages at higher optimization levels or when the &lt;code&gt;-foptimize-sibling-calls&lt;/code&gt; option is passed.&lt;ref name="llvm-documentation-tco"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lattner |first1=Chris |title=LLVM Language Reference Manual, section: The LLVM Target-Independent Code Generator, sub: Tail Call Optimization |url=http://llvm.org/docs/CodeGenerator.html#tail-call-optimization |website=The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure |publisher=The LLVM Project |accessdate=24 June 2018 |ref=llvm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html|title=Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC): Optimize Options|website=gcc.gnu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/522809 |title=foptimize-sibling-calls|website=software.intel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the given language syntax may not explicitly support it, the compiler can make this optimization whenever it can determine that the return types for the caller and callee are equivalent, and that the argument types passed to both function are either the same, or require the same amount of total storage space on the call stack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/tackling-c-tail-calls/184401756|title=Tackling C++ Tail Calls|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various implementation methods are available.

===In assembly===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Tail calls are often optimized by [[interpreter (computing)|interpreters]] and [[compiler]]s of [[functional programming]] and [[logic programming]] languages to more efficient forms of [[iteration]]. For example, [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] programmers commonly express [[while loop]]s as calls to procedures in tail position and rely on the Scheme compiler or interpreter to substitute the tail calls with more efficient [[jump (computer science)|jump]] instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2000-07/msg00595.html | title=proper tail recursion for gcc | publisher=GCC Project | date=20 July 2000 | accessdate=10 March 2015 | author=Probst, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For compilers generating assembly directly, tail call elimination is easy: it suffices to replace a call opcode with a jump one, after fixing parameters on the stack.
From a compiler's perspective, the first example above is initially translated into pseudo-[[assembly language]] (in fact, this is valid [[x86 assembly language|x86 assembly]]):
&lt;source lang="asm"&gt;
 foo:
  call B
  call A
  ret
&lt;/source&gt;
Tail call elimination replaces the last two lines with a single jump instruction:
&lt;source lang="asm"&gt;

 foo:
  call B
  jmp  A
&lt;/source&gt;
After subroutine &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; completes, it will then return directly to the return address of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, omitting the unnecessary &lt;code&gt;ret&lt;/code&gt; statement.

Typically, the subroutines being called need to be supplied with [[parameter (computer science)|parameter]]s. The generated code thus needs to make sure that the [[call frame]] for A is properly set up before jumping to the tail-called subroutine. For instance, on [[platform (computing)|platform]]s where the [[call stack]] does not just contain the [[return statement|return address]], but also the parameters for the subroutine, the compiler may need to emit instructions to adjust the call stack. On such a platform, for the code:
 '''function''' foo(data1, data2)
    B(data1)
    '''return''' A(data2)
(where &lt;code&gt;data1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;data2&lt;/code&gt; are parameters) a compiler might translate that as:{{efn| The &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; instruction first pushes the current code location onto the stack and then performs an unconditional jump to the code location indicated by the label. The &lt;code&gt;ret&lt;/code&gt; instruction first pops a code location off the stack, then performs an unconditional jump to the retrieved code location. }}
&lt;source lang="nasm" line&gt;
 foo:
   mov  reg,[sp+data1] ; fetch data1 from stack (sp) parameter into a scratch register.
   push reg            ; put data1 on stack where B expects it
   call B              ; B uses data1
   pop                 ; remove data1 from stack
   mov  reg,[sp+data2] ; fetch data2 from stack (sp) parameter into a scratch register.
   push reg            ; put data2 on stack where A expects it
   call A              ; A uses data2
   pop                 ; remove data2 from stack.
   ret
&lt;/source&gt;
A tail call optimizer could then change the code to:
&lt;source lang="nasm" line&gt;
 foo:
   mov  reg,[sp+data1] ; fetch data1 from stack (sp) parameter into a scratch register.
   push reg            ; put data1 on stack where B expects it
   call B              ; B uses data1
   pop                 ; remove data1 from stack
   mov  reg,[sp+data2] ; fetch data2 from stack (sp) parameter into a scratch register.
   mov  [sp+data1],reg ; put data2 where A expects it
   jmp  A              ; A uses data2 and returns immediately to caller.
&lt;/source&gt;
This code is more efficient both in terms of execution speed and use of stack space.

===Through trampolining===
Since many [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] compilers use [[C (programming language)|C]] as an intermediate target code, the tail recursion must be encoded in C without growing the stack, even if the C compiler does not optimize tail calls. Many implementations achieve this by using a device known as a [[Trampoline (computers)|trampoline]], a piece of code that repeatedly calls functions. All functions are entered via the trampoline. When a function has to tail-call another, instead of calling it directly and then returning the result, it returns the address of the function to be called and the call parameters back to the trampoline (from which it was called itself), and the trampoline takes care of calling this function next with the specified parameters. This ensures that the C stack does not grow and iteration can continue indefinitely.

It is possible to implement trampolines using [[higher-order function]]s in languages that support them, such as [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]], [[Visual Basic .NET]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].&lt;ref name="onyourtail"&gt;Samuel Jack, [http://blog.functionalfun.net/2008/04/bouncing-on-your-tail.html Bouncing on your tail]. ''Functional Fun''. April 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a trampoline for all function calls is rather more expensive than the normal C function call, so at least one Scheme compiler, [[Chicken (Scheme implementation)|Chicken]], uses a technique first described by [[Henry Baker (computer scientist)|Henry Baker]] from an unpublished suggestion by [[Andrew Appel]],&lt;ref name="Chicken"&gt;Henry Baker, [http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/CheneyMTA.html "CONS Should Not CONS Its Arguments, Part II: Cheney on the M.T.A."]&lt;/ref&gt; in which normal C&amp;nbsp;calls are used but the stack size is checked before every call. When the stack reaches its maximum permitted size, objects on the stack are [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage-collected]] using the [[Cheney algorithm]] by moving all live data into a separate heap. Following this, the stack is unwound ("popped") and the program resumes from the state saved just before the garbage collection. Baker says "Appel's method avoids making a large number of small trampoline bounces by occasionally jumping off the Empire State Building."&lt;ref name="Chicken" /&gt; The garbage collection ensures that mutual tail recursion can continue indefinitely. However, this approach requires that no C function call ever returns, since there is no guarantee that its caller's stack frame still exists; therefore, it involves a much more dramatic internal rewriting of the program code: [[continuation-passing style]].

==Relation to ''while'' construct==
Tail recursion can be related to the [[while loop|''while'']] [[control flow]] operator by means of a transformation such as the following:

 '''function''' foo(''x'') '''is''':
   '''if''' ''predicate''(''x'') '''then'''
     '''return''' foo(bar(''x''))
   '''else'''
     '''return''' baz(''x'')

The above construct transforms to:

 '''function''' foo(''x'') '''is''':
   '''while''' ''predicate''(''x'') '''do''':
     ''x'' ← bar(''x'')
   '''return''' baz(''x'')

In the preceding, ''x'' may be a tuple involving more than one variable: if so, care must be taken in designing the assignment statement ''x'' ← bar(''x'') so that dependencies are respected.  One may need to introduce auxiliary variables or use a ''[[swap (computer science)|swap]]'' construct.

More general uses of tail recursion may be related to control flow operators such as '''break''' and '''continue''', as in the following:

 '''function''' foo(''x'') '''is''':
   '''if''' ''p''(''x'') '''then'''
     '''return''' bar(''x'')
   '''else if''' ''q''(''x'') '''then'''
     '''return''' baz(''x'')
   ...
   '''else if''' ''t''(''x'') '''then'''
     '''return''' foo(quux(''x''))
   ...
   '''else'''
     '''return''' foo(quuux(''x''))

where ''bar'' and ''baz'' are direct return calls, whereas ''quux'' and ''quuux'' involve a recursive tail call to ''foo''. A translation is given as follows:

 '''function''' foo(''x'') '''is''':
   '''do''':
     '''if''' ''p''(''x'') '''then'''
       ''x'' ← bar(''x'')
       '''break'''
     '''else if''' ''q''(''x'') '''then'''
       ''x'' ← baz(''x'')
       '''break'''
     ...
     '''else if''' ''t''(''x'') '''then'''
       ''x'' ← quux(''x'')
       '''continue'''
     ...
     '''else'''
       ''x'' ← quuux(''x'')
       '''continue'''
     '''loop'''
   '''return''' ''x''

[[File:VandA Rotunda.jpg|thumb|right|The V&amp;A Rotunda Chandelier hangs at the entrance to the Victoria and Albert Museum, London]]
The '''V&amp;A Rotunda Chandelier''' (often known as '''V&amp;A Chandelier''' and originally called '''''Ice Blue and Spring Green Chandelier''''') is a glass sculpture by [[Dale Chihuly]]. It hangs under the glass [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] at the entrance to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[South Kensington]], [[London]]. Considered to be an artwork as much as a source of light, it was installed in 1999 and then substantially altered and enlarged to its current size in 2001, coinciding with a V&amp;A exhibition of the artist's work. 

== Description ==

The chandelier has dimensions of {{convert|27|xx|12|xx|12|ft|m}} and is made of [[Glass blowing|blown glass]]. The original name was ''Ice Blue and Spring Green Chandelier''. It was created with blue, green, and yellow glass composed of fused, relatively small swirling tendrils and sharp protruding edges that extend outward from every side. The top and the bottom are composed of a more rounded shape, while a smaller round arrangement of glass hangs in the middle. The top has a notable protrusion, mainly of light blue glass, which then develops into shades of yellow and green as the viewer's eye moves downwards.
[[File:V&amp;A Chandelier detail.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the chandelier]]
The first chandelier was installed in 1999 and was more modest, however, Chihuly decided it needed to be bigger and enlarged it so that it now fills the central rotunda at the entrance to the museum. Commenting in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', art critic Richard Dorment noted: "The V&amp;A chandelier isn't exactly 'finished' – Chihuly just stopped adding baubles and curlicues and wiggly bits to it. Because its shape is so amorphous, there is no aesthetic reason that I can see why the glass-maker should not continue to ornament the work for the rest of his life, or for as long as the laws of physics allow him to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Culture |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4724668/The-mind-blowing-gift-of-a-master.html |title=The mind-blowing gift of a master |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While referred to as a chandelier, technically this is a hanging sculpture, a concept Chihuly has favored throughout his career. His technique is to let the glass naturally shape itself. This approach, in combination with his use of vibrant colors, has been described by curator Tina Oldknow as creating: "vessels that communicate a range of aesthetic experience from the ephemeral moods…to the highly emotional, transformational environments realized in large-scale installations".&lt;ref&gt;Tina Oldknow, "Dale Chihuly: A Selective Biography," Glass Art Society Journal (2003), 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Like most of Chihuly’s works, the chandelier does not light up on its own. In some instances, lights were placed on the piece after the fact or external spotlights were directed towards the structure to illuminate them.&lt;ref&gt;William Warmus, The Essential Dale Chihuly Book, (New York: Wonderland Press, 2000), 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Care and maintenance ==

The massive size of the chandelier and the delicate nature of the glass meant the museum had had to make special accommodations to house and maintain it. Before the chandelier could even be installed, the V&amp;A had to reinforce the ceiling. Cleaning the chandelier requires specialist techniques. It is cleaned piece by piece by a technician on a raised platform. The technician moves slowly around the chandelier cleaning each individual spike and tendril of glass with an antistatic wand made of plastic filaments. This has to be carried out before the museum opens, a process that takes several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/b/behind-the-scenes-chihuly-chandelier/ |title=Behind the scenes: Cleaning Dale Chihuly's V&amp;A Rotunda chandelier - Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critics' response ==

The critical response was generally positive, if somewhat uncertain. The ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' reported: "Whether it attracts you or appals you, Chihuly’s work is certainly breathtaking". Another critic, writing in a home-interest magazine, said: "Wriggling like a large and glowing creature of the sea, this spectacularly weird glass chandelier…[is] the first time Dale’s work has been seen on this scale in the UK and he seems to gather a few more admirers as a result".&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Hawkins Opie, Editor., Chihuly at the V&amp;A (Portland: Portland Press, 2001), 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Versailles [[Orangery|Orangerie]]''' (French: '''L′Orangerie du Château de Versailles''') was built by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] between 1684 and 1686, replacing Le Vaus design from 1663 - that is to say, before work on the [[Château de Versailles|palace]] had even begun. It is an example of many such prestigious extensions of grand gardens in Europe designed both to shelter tender plants and impress visitors. In the winter, the Versailles Orangerie houses more than a thousand trees in boxes. Most are [[citrus]] trees, but there are many tender Mediterranean plants including [[oleanders]], [[olive]], [[pomegranate]], and [[palm (plant)|palm]] trees, totaling over 1,055 altogether. From May to October, they are put outdoors in the Parterre Bas.

==The allure of citrus==
[[File:L'Orangerie du château de Versailles par Étienne Allegrain - Collections du château du Versailles (adjusted).jpg|thumb|View of the Orangerie in 1695 as painted by [[Étienne Allegrain]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Martin]]]]
[[Image:Orangerie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Parc de Versailles, with the orange trees in boxes]]

The sweet orange ([[Citrus sinensis]]) was introduced to Europe by the fifteenth or sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="L. Ramón-Laca 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=4256736 | title=The Introduction of Cultivated Citrus to Europe via Northern Africa and the Iberian Peninsula | author=Ramón-Laca, L. | journal=Economic Botany |date=Winter 2003 | volume=57 | issue=4 | pages=510 | doi=10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057[0502:tiocct]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, they were an expensive food item. Medieval cookbooks tell exactly how many orange slices a visiting dignitary was entitled to. Citrus soon became the fashion of the nobility and rich merchants. By the sixteenth century, sweet oranges had become well-established and had assumed commercial importance in Europe.

In France, the first orangerie  was built and stocked by [[Charles VIII of France]] at the [[Château d'Amboise|Château of Amboise]].&lt;ref name="Hyams - History"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of Gardens and Gardening | author=Hyams, Edward | publisher=Praeger Publishers | location=New York | year=1971|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is general agreement that the arrival of the sweet orange in Europe was linked with the activities of the Portuguese during the fifteenth century, and particularly by [[Vasco de Gama]]'s voyages to the East. Although the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had been acquainted with lemons and probably [[Bitter orange|sour oranges]] as well as citrons, the different types - sour oranges, [[lemon]]s and sweet [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] - reached Europe centuries apart. By withholding water and nutrients, and by using pruning techniques, French gardeners were able to make citrus trees bloom throughout the year, to the delight of Louis XIV. Citrus motifs formed themes in sculpture, mosaics, embroidery, weaving, paintings, poems, and songs throughout history, and orange blossoms remain prized as floral ornaments at weddings.&lt;ref name="Scora 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2484763 | title=On the History and Origin of Citrus | author=Scora, Rainer W | journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club | date=Nov–Dec 1975 | volume=102 | issue=6 |  pages=370–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The central gallery is flanked by two side galleries located under the “Escaliers des Cent Marches”. The three galleries enclose the lower bed (''parterre bas''), also called the 'bed de l'orangerie'. The walls of these galleries are 4-5 meters thick (13-16 feet) and the central gallery is over 150 meters long (500 feet), facing south to optimize the natural warming effects of the sun. As a result a frost-free environment is maintained without the use of artificial heating year round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chateauversailles.fr/discover/estate/gardens/orangery#the-building| title=The Orangery| publisher=chateauversailles.fr| access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the center of the ''Parterre Bas'' is a large circular pool with a ''jet d'eau'' water feature, surrounded by formal lawns planted with topiary. From May to October, the orange trees and other trees are exposed in the lower bed. There are over 1,000 different containers altogether, with several Pomegranate (''Punica granatum''), Olive (''Olea europea''), and Orange (''Citrus sinensis'') trees that are over 200 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://en.chateauversailles.fr/discover/estate/gardens/orangery | title=The Orangery | publisher=Chateaudeversailles.fr | access-date=2017-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Louis XIV==
Originally completed in 1663, the Orangerie was intended to supply the much smaller hunting lodge of Versailles and the small retinue which Louis XIV would bring with him in the summer. In 1688, after the Court had officially relocated to Versailles, the Orangerie was enlarged by Jules Hardouin-Mansart. The pavilion that resulted was modelled on the theories of the horticulturalist Jean-Baptiste de la Quintinie, whose writings detailed a system for protecting exotic plants from the cold without the use of artificial heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gardens of Versailles| author=Leroux, Jean-Baptiste| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| year=2002| p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Louis XIV had a love for orange trees and had them potted in solid silver tubs and placed throughout the state rooms of the Palace to perfume the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Sun King| author=Nancy Mitford| publisher=Sphere Books Ltd.| year=1966|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orangerie was intended to supply the palace with specimens and supply the Court with fruit year round. In 1664, a year after the first Orangerie was completed, Louis XIV's disgraced former Finance Minister [[Nicolas Fouquet]] was convicted of maladministration and his belongings confiscated by the Crown. These included over 1,000 orange trees from [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]], which were transferred to the Orangerie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Sun King| author=Nancy Mitford| publisher=Sphere Books Ltd.| year=1966|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numbering several thousand trees by the 1790s, the Orangerie was the largest of its kind in Europe and a major attraction for visiting diplomats and foreign royalty. In 1698 the [[British Ambassador to France]], [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland]], reported back to King[[William III of England| William III]] that he had been taken to view the orange trees at Versailles, but compared them unfavorably to William's own collections in [[Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Sun King| author=Nancy Mitford| publisher=Sphere Books Ltd.| year=1966|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location in the garden==
The Versailles Orangerie is under the flowerbed known as "parterre du midi". Its central gallery is 155 metres in length, and its frontage is directed towards the south.  The “Parterre Bas” is bordered on its south side by a balustrade overlooking the [[Saint-Cyr-l'École]]. This separates it from the Swiss Pond.

The '''''WWE Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to World Wrestling Entertainment''''' is a reference book featuring in-depth knowledge surrounding the leading organization in [[professional wrestling]], [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE).

The book covers the 45-year history of WWE and features a comprehensive A-Z listing of nearly 1,000 former and current wrestlers from as early as the 1960s to the present day. The book also contains official listings for title histories, television and pay-per-view events, most notably, a detailed history of [[WrestleMania]].

== Synopsis ==
The ''WWE Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to World Wrestling Entertainment'' contains profiles for past and present WWE personalities, as well as event and title histories. While providing information primarily about the personalities career in WWE, information is also present about their careers in other companies. People who portrayed separate characters are often given separate profiles for each character.&lt;ref name=exc/&gt;

People who left the company on bad terms were given favorable profiles, including [[Debrah Miceli|Alundra Blayze]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior]].&lt;ref name=exc/&gt; [[Chris Benoit]] has a profile in the encyclopedia, however there is no mentioned of the [[Chris Benoit double murder and suicide|double murder and suicide]].&lt;ref name=exc/&gt;&lt;ref name=scenes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2009/07/30/10319851.html|title=Behind the scenes of the WWE Encyclopedia|author=Sokol, Bryan|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|date=August 20, 2009|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
Brian Shields and Kevin Sullivan (not the wrestler) created the book together.&lt;ref name=scenes/&gt; WWE was given final say over who would be included in the book.&lt;ref name=scenes/&gt; Overall, the book took over one year to create.&lt;ref name=scenes/&gt; Sullivan and Shields divided some of the work load, dividing the research for championship title histories in half.&lt;ref name=scenes/&gt;

== Reception ==
The book debuted at No. 10 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' Hardcover Books Bestsellers List and climbed as high as No. 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/article2350484.ece|author=Aldren, Mike|title=Daily wrestling news and gossip|publisher=The Sun|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It received mostly favorable reviews. Bob Kapur of SLAM! Wrestling was favorable toward the book, saying that it "is just the ticket for fans looking for a trip down memory lane".&lt;ref name=exc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Reviews/2009/06/01/9633656.html|title=WWE Encyclopedia an excellent resource|author=Kapur, Bob|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|date=June 14, 2009|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised the book for including lesser known personalities, but also criticized the absence of notable [[tag team]]s such as [[The Can-Am Express|Doug Furnas and Phil LaFon]].&lt;ref name=exc/&gt; Simon Rothstein of ''[[The Sun (magazine)|The Sun]]'' stated, "I cannot stress how much fun this book is to read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/article2378883.ece|title=New WWE book is a smash hit|author=Rothstein, Simon|publisher=The Sun|date=April 15, 2009|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5069">The '''Whetstone benchmark''' is a synthetic [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] for evaluating the performance of [[computer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Curnow, H.J. and Wichman, B.A. "[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20130303230703/http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/whetstone.pdf A Synthetic Benchmark]" ''Computer Journal'', Volume 19, Issue 1, February 1976., p. 43-49.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first written in [[Algol 60]] in 1972 at TSU (The Technical Support Unit of the Department of Trade and Industry - later part of the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency or [[Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency|CCTA]] in the [[United Kingdom]]). It was derived from statistics on program behaviour gathered on the [[KDF9]] computer at NPL [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] in the [[United Kingdom]], using a modified version of its Whetstone [[ALGOL 60]] compiler. The workload on the machine was represented as a set of frequencies of execution of the 124 instructions of the Whetstone Code. The Whetstone Compiler was built at the Atomic Power Division of the [[English Electric]] Company in [[Whetstone, Leicestershire]], England,&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Randell|Randell, Brian]] and Russell, Lawford John "[http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/ALGOL/book/Randell_ALGOL_60_Implementation_1964.pdf Algol 60 Implementation]" London: Academic Press, 1964. {{ISBN|0-12-578150-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; hence its name. Dr. B.A. Wichman at NPL produced a set of 42 simple ALGOL 60 statements, which in a suitable combination matched the execution statistics.

To make a more practical benchmark Harold Curnow of TSU wrote a program incorporating the 42 statements. This program worked in its ALGOL 60 version, but when translated into [[FORTRAN]] it was not executed correctly by the IBM optimizing compiler. Calculations whose results were not output were omitted. He then produced a set of program fragments which were more like real code and which collectively matched the original 124 Whetstone instructions. Timing this program gave a measure of the machine’s speed in thousands of Whetstone instructions per second (kWips) The Fortran version became the first general purpose benchmark that set industry standards of computer system performance. Further development was carried out by Roy Longbottom, also of TSU/CCTA, who became the official design authority. The ALGOL 60 program ran under the Whetstone compiler in July 2010, for the first time since the last KDF9 was shut down in 1980, but now executed by   [http://www.findlayw.plus.com/KDF9 a KDF9 emulator].

Following increased computer speeds, performance measurement was changed to Millions of Whetstone Instructions Per Second (MWIPS). The original results on numerous [[minicomputers]], [[mainframes]] and [[supercomputers]] are available in [http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/whetstone.htm Whetstone Benchmark History and Results]. This also shows original system costs and year of manufacture. For comparison purposes, a summary of results on PCs is also provided, including a table showing the relative efficiency of various programming languages. [http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/whetstone%20results.htm Detailed results on PCs] are also available, showing speeds of the different test functions.

Source code and pre-compiled versions for PCs in [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], [[BASIC|Basic]], [[Visual Basic]], [[Fortran]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] are available in [http://freespace.virgin.net/roy.longbottom/ Roy Longbottom's PC Benchmark Collection (Free).] Compiled codes include those to run via [[DOS]], [[OS/2]] plus 32 bit and 64 bit [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

When information from [http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/ Roy Longbottom’s site] is no longer available, [https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20130303230739/http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/index.htm the files], up to at least 2013, have been archived at British Library, with [https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20130303230703/http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/whetstone.htm Whetstone Data] being of particular significance.

The Whetstone benchmark primarily measures the [[floating-point arithmetic]] performance. A similar benchmark for integer and string operations is the [[Dhrystone]].
