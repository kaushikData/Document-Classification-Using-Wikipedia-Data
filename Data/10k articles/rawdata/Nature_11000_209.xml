'''Aldo Leopold''' (January 11, 1887 – April 21, 1948) was an American author, philosopher, scientist, ecologist, forester, conservationist, and environmentalist. He was a professor at the [[University of Wisconsin]] and is best known for his book ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949), which has sold more than two million copies.

Leopold was influential in the development of modern [[environmental ethics]] and in the movement for wilderness conservation. His ethics of nature and wildlife preservation had a profound impact on the environmental movement, with his ecocentric or holistic ethics regarding land.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip F. Cramer, ''Deep Environmental Politics: The Role of Radical Environmentalism in Crafting American Environmental Policy'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized biodiversity and ecology and was a founder of the science of [[wildlife management]].&lt;ref&gt;Errington, pp. 341–350&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rand Aldo Leopold was born in [[Burlington, Iowa]], on January 11, 1887. His father, Carl Leopold, was a businessman who made walnut desks and was first cousin to his wife, Clara Starker. Charles Starker, father of Clara and uncle of Carl, was a German immigrant, educated in engineering and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hansen. "[http://www.leopoldheritage.org/index.php/leopold-s-legacy/hansen-column Bringing up Aldo]". Leopold Heritage Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand Aldo was named after two of his father's business partners—C. W. Rand and Aldo Sommers—although he eventually dropped the use of "Rand". The Leopold family included younger siblings Mary Luize, Carl Starker, and Frederic.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold's first language was German,&lt;ref&gt;Meine, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; although he mastered English at an early age.

Aldo Leopold's early life was highlighted by the outdoors. Carl would take his children on excursions into the woods and taught his oldest son woodcraft and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Meine, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Aldo showed an aptitude for observation, spending hours counting and cataloging birds near his home.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Mary would later say of her older brother, "He was very much an outdoorsman, even in his extreme youth. He was always out climbing around the bluffs, or going down to the river, or going across the river into the woods."&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Prospect Hill Elementary, where he ranked at the top of his class, and then, the overcrowded Burlington High School. Every August, the family vacationed in Michigan at the forested [[Les Cheneaux Islands]] in [[Lake Huron]], which the children took to exploring.&lt;ref&gt;Meine, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schooling==
[[File:Aldo Leopold Sheffield Scientific School Class of 1908.jpg|thumb|left|Leopold's entry in the [[Yale]] [[Sheffield Scientific School]] yearbook, 1908]]

In 1900, [[Gifford Pinchot]], who oversaw the newly implemented Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture, donated money to [[Yale University]] to begin one of the nation's first forestry schools. Hearing of this development, the teenaged Leopold decided on forestry as a vocation.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; His parents agreed to let him attend [[The Lawrenceville School]], a preparatory college in New Jersey, to improve his chances of admission to Yale. The Burlington High School principal wrote in a reference letter to the headmaster at Lawrenceville that Leopold was "as earnest a boy as we have in school... painstaking in his work.... Moral character above reproach."&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived at his new school in January 1904, shortly before he turned 17. He was considered an attentive student, although he was again drawn to the outdoors. Lawrenceville was suitably rural, and Leopold spent much time mapping the area and studying its wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;Meine, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold studied at the Lawrenceville School for a year, during which time he was accepted to Yale. Because the [[Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies|Yale School of Forestry]] granted only graduate degrees, he first enrolled in [[Sheffield Scientific School]]'s preparatory forestry courses for his undergraduate studies.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; While Leopold was able to explore the woods and fields of Lawrenceville daily, sometimes to the detriment of his studying, at Yale he had little opportunity to do so; his studies and social life engagements made his outdoor trips few and far between.&lt;ref&gt;Meine, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1909, Leopold was assigned to the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]]'s District 3 in the Arizona and New Mexico territories. At first, he was a forest assistant at the Apache National Forest in the Arizona Territory. In 1911, he was transferred to the Carson National Forest in northern New Mexico. Leopold's career, which kept him in New Mexico until 1924, included developing the first comprehensive management plan for the [[Grand Canyon]], writing the Forest Service's first game and fish handbook, and proposing [[Gila Wilderness|Gila Wilderness Area]], the first national wilderness area in the Forest Service system.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;Meine&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 1923, he was elected an associate member (now called "professional member") of the [[Boone and Crockett Club]], a wildlife conservation organization founded by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[George Bird Grinnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boone and Crockett Club Archives|url=http://cdm16013.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p16013coll13/id/125/rec/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, he accepted transfer to the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin, and became an associate director.

In 1933, he was appointed Professor of Game Management in the Agricultural Economics Department at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], the first such professorship of wildlife management.

[[File:Aldo Leopold's headstone.jpeg|thumb|Leopold's headstone at his family plot in Aspen Grove Cemetery in [[Burlington, Iowa]]]]

He married Estella Bergere in northern New Mexico in 1912 and they had five children together.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold Family. "[https://www.aldoleopold.org/about/aldo-leopold/leopold-family/ Leopold Family]". The Aldo Leopold Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; They lived in a modest two-story home close to the UW–Madison campus. His children followed in his footsteps as teachers and naturalists: [[A. Starker Leopold|Aldo Starker Leopold]] (1913–1983) was a wildlife biologist and professor at UC Berkeley;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raitt, RJ|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v101n04/p0868-p0871.pdf |title=In Memoriam: A. Starker Leopold|journal=Auk|year=1984|volume= 101|issue=4|pages= 868–871|doi=10.2307/4086914}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luna Leopold|Luna B. Leopold]] (1915–2006) became a [[hydrology|hydrologist]] and geology professor at UC Berkeley; [[Nina Leopold Bradley]] (1917–2011) was a researcher and naturalist; [[A. Carl Leopold|Aldo Carl Leopold]] (1919–2009) was a plant physiologist,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Staves and [[Randy Wayne (biologist)|Randy Wayne]]. (December 3, 2009.) "[http://www.lansingstar.com/content/view/5628/71/#ixzz0ZaZuYZGo In Memoriam: A. Carl Leopold]". ''The Lansing Star''. Retrieved on February 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; who taught at Purdue University for 25 years; and daughter [[Estella Leopold]] (b. 1927) is  a noted botanist and conservationist who is a professor ''emeritus'' at the University of Washington. Today, Leopold's home is an official landmark of the city of Madison.

He purchased 80 acres in the [[Central Plain (Wisconsin)|sand country]] of central Wisconsin. The once-forested region had been logged, swept by repeated fires, overgrazed by dairy cows, and left barren. There, he put his theories to work in the field and eventually wrote his best-selling ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949), finished just prior to his death. Leopold died of a heart attack while battling a wild fire on a neighbor's property.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==
Early on, Leopold was assigned to hunt and kill bears, wolves, and mountain lions in New Mexico. Local ranchers hated these predators because of livestock losses, but Leopold came to respect the animals. He developed an ecological ethic that replaced the earlier wilderness ethic that stressed the need for human dominance. His rethinking the importance of predators in the balance of nature has resulted in the return of bears and mountain lions to New Mexico wilderness areas.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

By the early 1920s, Leopold had concluded that a particular kind of preservation should be embraced in the national forests of the American West. He was prompted to this by the rampant building of roads to accommodate the "proliferation of the automobile" and the related increasingly heavy recreational demands placed on public lands. He was the first to employ the term "wilderness" to describe such preservation. Over the next two decades, he added ethical and scientific rationales to his defense of the wilderness concept. In one essay, he rhetorically asked, "Of what avail are forty freedoms without a blank spot on the map?" Leopold saw a progress of ethical sensitivity from interpersonal relationships, to relationships to society as a whole, to relationships with the land, leading to a steady diminution of actions based on expediency, conquest, and self-interest. Leopold thus rejected the utilitarianism of conservationists such as [[Theodore Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

By the 1930s, Leopold was the nation's foremost expert on wildlife management.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} He advocated the scientific management of wildlife habitats by both public and private landholders rather than a reliance on game refuges, hunting laws, and other methods intended to protect specific species of desired game. In his 1933 book ''Game Management'', Leopold defined the science of wildlife management as "the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use." But, as Curt Meine&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt; has pointed out, he also considered it to be a technique for restoring and maintaining diversity in the environment.

The concept of "wilderness" also took on a new meaning; Leopold no longer saw it as a hunting or recreational ground, but as an arena for a healthy biotic community, including wolves and mountain lions. In 1935, he helped found the [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]], dedicated to expanding and protecting the nation's wilderness areas. He regarded the society as "one of the focal points of a new attitude—an intelligent humility toward Man's place in nature."&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Flader, ''Thinking Like a Mountain: Aldo Leopold and the Evolution of an Ecological Attitude toward Deer, Wolves and Forests''. Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 1974, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Science writer Connie Barlow says Leopold wrote eloquently from a perspective that today would be called [[Religious Naturalism]].

==Nature writing==
Leopold's [[Nature Writing|nature writing]] is notable for its simple directness. His portrayals of various natural environments through which he had moved, or had known for many years, displayed impressive intimacy with what exists and happens in nature. He offered frank criticism of the harm he believed was frequently done to natural systems (such as land) out of a sense of a culture or society's sovereign ownership over the land base – eclipsing any sense of a community of life to which humans belong. He felt the security and prosperity resulting from "mechanization" now gives people the time to reflect on the preciousness of nature and to learn more about what happens there; however, he also wrote, "Theoretically, the mechanization of farming ought to cut the farmer's chains, but whether it really does is debatable."&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. ''A Sand County Almanac'' (1970 ed.) p. 262)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A Sand County Almanac''===
The book was published in 1949, shortly after Leopold's death. One of the well-known quotes from the book which clarifies his [[land ethic]] is,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the [[biotic community]]. It is wrong when it tends otherwise. (p.262) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of a [[trophic cascade]] is put forth in the chapter, "[[Thinking like a mountain|Thinking Like a Mountain]]", wherein Leopold realizes that killing a predator wolf carries serious implications for the rest of the ecosystem&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo [http://www.eco-action.org/dt/thinking.html "Thinking Like a Mountain"]&lt;/ref&gt; — a conclusion that found sympathetic appreciation generations later:

{{quote|In January 1995 I helped carry the first grey wolf into Yellowstone, where they had been eradicated by federal predator control policy only six decades earlier. Looking through the crates into her eyes, I reflected on how Aldo Leopold once took part in that policy, then eloquently challenged it. By illuminating for us how wolves play a critical role in the whole of creation, he expressed the ethic and the laws which would reintroduce them nearly a half-century after his death.|[[Bruce Babbitt]], former [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, quote on back cover&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===[[Land ethic|Land Ethic]]===
In "The Land Ethic", a chapter in ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'', Leopold delves into conservation in "The Ecological Conscience" section. He wrote: "Conservation is a state of harmony between men and land." He noted that conservation guidelines at the time boiled down to: "obey the law, vote right, join some organizations, and practice what conservation is profitable on your own land; the government will do the rest." (p.&amp;nbsp;243–244)

Leopold explained:

{{quote|The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land.

This sounds simple: do we not already sing our love for and obligation to the land of the free and the home of the brave? Yes, but just what and whom do we love? Certainly not the soil, which we are sending helter-skelter down river. Certainly not the waters, which we assume have no function except to turn turbines, float barges, and carry off sewage. Certainly not the plants, of which we exterminate whole communities without batting an eye. Certainly not the animals, of which we have already extirpated many of the largest and most beautiful species. A land ethic of course cannot prevent the alteration, management, and use of these ‘resources,’ but it does affirm their right to continued existence, and, at least in spots, their continued existence in a natural state. In short, a land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such.}}

== Legacy ==
The Aldo Leopold Foundation of [[Baraboo, Wisconsin]], was founded in 1982 by Aldo and Estella Leopold's five children as a 501(c)3 not-for-profit conservation organization whose mission is "to foster the land ethic through the legacy of Aldo Leopold." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aldoleopold.org/about/mission-vision/ Mission / Vision]&lt;/ref&gt; The Aldo Leopold Foundation owns and manages the original [[Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm]] and 300 surrounding acres, in addition to several other parcels. Its headquarters is at the green-built Leopold Center, where it conducts educational and land stewardship programs. The foundation also acts as the executor of Leopold's literary estate, encourages scholarship on Leopold, and serves as a clearinghouse for information regarding Leopold, his work, and his ideas. It provides interpretive resources and tours for thousands of visitors annually, distributes a curriculum about how to use Leopold's writing and [[land ethic|ideas]] in environmental education,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aldoleopold.org/teach-learn/leopold-education-project/ Leopold Education Project]&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains a robust website and numerous print resources. In 2012, in collaboration with the [[United States Forest Service]], the foundation released the first high-definition, full-length film about Leopold, entitled ''Green Fire: Aldo Leopold and a Land Ethic for Our Time.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aldoleopold.org/greenfire/index.shtml|title=Green Fire Film |publisher=The Aldo Leopold Foundation|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film aired on public television stations across the nation and won a Midwest regional Emmy award in the documentary category.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aldoleopold.org/teach-learn/green-fire-film/about-green-fire/ About Green Fire]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute at University of Montana Missoula 20130725.JPG|thumb|Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute]]
The [[Aldo Leopold Wilderness]] in New Mexico's [[Gila National Forest]] was named after him in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&amp;sec=wildView&amp;wid=4&amp;tab=General&amp;CFID=5163954&amp;CFTOKEN=93201038 Aldo Leopold Wilderness], Wilderness.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture was established in 1987 at [[Iowa State University]] in Ames. It was named in honor of Leopold. Since its founding, it has pioneered new forms of sustainable agriculture practices.

The [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] established the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute at the [[University of Montana|University of Montana, Missoula]] in 1993. It is "the only Federal research group in the United States dedicated to the development and dissemination of knowledge needed to improve management of [[wilderness]], [[park]]s, and similarly [[protected area]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leopold.wilderness.net/about-us/default.php |title=About Us |publisher=Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute |accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aldo Leopold Legacy Trail System]], a system of 42 state trails in Wisconsin, was created by the state in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dnr.wi.gov/news/BreakingNews_Print.asp?id=1290 DNR Secretary: Aldo Leopold's legacy alive on renamed trails Find a Wisconsin State Trail].

'''''Alien From L.A.''''' is a 1988 [[science fiction film]] that stars [[Kathy Ireland]] as a young woman who visits the underground civilization of [[Atlantis]]. The film was featured on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

==Plot==
Wanda Saknussemm (Ireland) is a nerdy social misfit with large glasses and an intolerable squeaky voice who lives in [[Los Angeles]] and works at a diner. After being dumped by her boyfriend for "not having a sense of adventure", Wanda is informed by a letter that her father, an [[archaeologist]], has died. She flies to [[North Africa]] and while going through her father's belongings, she finds his notes about Atlantis, apparently an alien ship that crashed millennia ago and sank into the center of the Earth. Wanda comes across a chamber beneath her father's apartment and accidentally sets off a chain of events that ultimately cause her to fall into a deep hole.

An unharmed Wanda wakes up deep within the Earth to find Gus (William R. Moses), a miner whom she protects from being slain by two people. Gus, who has a very inconsistent Australian accent, agrees to help Wanda find her father, whom she believes is alive and trapped underground. Wanda soon discovers that both she and her father are believed to be spies planning an invasion of Atlantis. During her adventures, Wanda's appearance changes from nerdy to attractive (by removing her glasses and using a steam vent to clean her skin). People from the surface world are referred to as "aliens" by Atlanteans, who appear virtually identical to surface dwellers, and when Wanda is overheard talking about [[Malibu Beach]] by a low-life informant (Janie Du Plessis), she soon becomes a hunted woman and must dodge efforts at capture, both from the mysterious "Government House" and from thugs in the pay of the crime lord Mambino ([[Deep Roy]]). During these sequences, many references to Wanda's "big bones" are made, as though it were a trait by which she could be identified; however, no obvious physical distinction between Wanda and the Atlanteans is noticeable.

Wanda's efforts at escape are aided by Charmin (Thom Matthews), a handsome rogue who (briefly) assists her flight and falls for Wanda. She is ultimately captured by the evil General Pykov (Du Plessis again), who wants to kill both Wanda and her incarcerated father. The Atlantean leader decides to free Wanda and her father, provided they remain quiet about Atlantis. Gus shows up and helps the duo escape while fighting off General Pykov and her soldiers. Wanda and her father board a ship that takes them back to the surface and the film ends with Wanda on the beach, wearing a bikini and a sarong. She refuses the advances of her ex-boyfriend and is soon reunited with Charmin, who inexplicably appears on a motorcycle.

==Production==

The film was mostly shot in [[Johannesburg]], at producer Avi Lerner's studio, plus additional shooting in [[Durban|Durban, South Africa]] and [[Swakopmund|Swakopmund, Namibia]]. Locations ranged from South Africa's deep digging mines and gold fields both on the outskirts of Johannesburg. There was one additional day of shooting at a safari complex near Pretoria. Most of the Namibia shoot took place in and around the old German colonial town of Swakopmund, with additional scenes also shot along Namibia's famed [[Skeleton Coast]].

The character of Arnold Saknussemm is a reference to Arne Saknussemm from Jules Verne's ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', an Icelandic explorer who had gone missing long before the narrative of the story had begun.

==Reception==
The film was featured in a 1993 episode of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0776500}}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode was released in March 2013 by [[Shout! Factory]].

'''Astra 19.2°E''' is the name for the group of [[Astra and Germany (satellites)|Astra]] [[communications satellite]]s co-located at the 19.2°East orbital position in the [[Geostationary orbit|Clarke Belt]] that are owned and operated by  [[SES S.A.|SES]] based in [[Betzdorf, Luxembourg]].

Astra 19.2°E used to be commonly known as Astra 1, as it was the first orbital position used by Astra and the craft positioned there all have the Astra 1x name, but this was changed by SES to Astra 19.2°E in 2008, to avoid confusion with other Astra orbital positions that now include Astra 1x craft originally positioned at 19.2°East.

The Astra satellites at 19.2°East provide for services [[telecommunications link|downlink]]ing in the 10.70&amp;nbsp;GHz-12.70&amp;nbsp;GHz range of the [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]].

Astra 19.2°E is one of the major TV satellite positions serving Europe, transmitting over 1,150 TV, radio and interactive channels to more than 93 million [[Direct-broadcast satellite|direct-to-home]] (DTH) and cable homes in 35 countries&lt;ref&gt;SES ASTRA  ''19.2°East'' (August, 2007). Company factsheet&lt;/ref&gt; (the other major satellite positions being at 13° East, [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2° East]], [[Astra 23.5°E|23.5° East]], and [[Astra 5°E|5° East]]).

There are more than 40 [[High-definition television|high definition television]] (HDTV) channels broadcast by the satellites at 19.2°E, using five HDTV platforms.&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt; SES was instrumental in introducing satellite HDTV broadcasting in Europe, using the Astra 19.2°E satellites, and helped establish the [[HD ready]] specifications for TVs to view HDTV broadcasts. A subsidiary of SES, [[HD+]] operates the HD+ [[free-to-view]] platform of German channels from Astra 19.2°E.

Astra 19.2°E was one of the last satellite position to carry numerous [[analog television|analogue]] channels, until April 30, 2012 when the switch-off of German analogue broadcasts was completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/2012050121592/germany-completes-analogue-switch-off-on-satellite.html Germany completes analogue switch-off on satellite] ''Rapid TV News'' (May 1, 2012) Retrieved on January 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the only position to have carried radio stations in the proprietary [[Astra Digital Radio]] format, although that technology was superseded by [[DVB-S]] radio as the analogue transponders that carried the service switched to digital.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/archive_uk/260805.html   Dedicated DVB-S radio transponder from ARD]" ''Broadband TV News'' (April 26, 2005) Retrieved on September 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market==
The satellites at the Astra 19.2°E position primarily provide digital TV, digital radio and multimedia services to Europe and North Africa, principally to [[Algeria]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Morocco]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;SES Astra ''19.2°E'' (August 2008) Company brochure. Accessed January 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Astra 19.2°E provides both [[free-to-air]] and a number of pay-TV services in networks such as [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD Digital]], ArenaSat, [[CanalDigitaal]], [[Canalsat|CanalSat]], [[Canal+ (Spanish satellite broadcasting company)|Canal+]], [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF Digital]], [[Sky Deutschland|Sky Germany]], [[ProSieben]], [[Sat.1]], [[Liberty Global Europe|UPC Direct]], and [[ZDF]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lyngsat.com/astra19.html |title=Astra 1F/1G/1H/1KR/1L at 19.2°E |publisher= LyngSat | accessdate= September 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the market leader for DTH and communal dish reception in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt;

The relatively close proximity of Astra 19.2°E to one of SES' other orbital positions, [[Astra 23.5°E]], allows the use in target countries of a single small dish fitted with a [[Monoblock LNB|monoblock]] [[Duo LNB]] to receive channels from both positions.

==Reach==
As of the end of 2016, the Astra satellites at 19.2° east broadcast 913 channels (525 in [[Standard-definition television|SD]], 381 in [[High-definition television|HD]], 7 in [[Ultra-high-definition television|UHD]]) to 116 million households&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ses.com/our-network/orbital-positions ''Our Network/Orbital Positions''] www.ses.com. Accessed March 29, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Launched in 1988, [[Astra 1A]] was the first satellite in the Astra 19.2°E group. With 16 transponders, Astra 1A was the first satellite intended for DTH reception of satellite TV across Europe. From the start of transmissions in 1989, Astra 1A carried four channels for [[Sky Television plc]], the world's first commercial multi-channel DTH service, on transponders leased before the satellite was completed.

Early channels broadcasting from 19.2°East included those primarily intended for the UK, Germany, the Benelux countries, and Scandinavia, and so-called pan-European channels such as [[MTV Europe]], [[CNN International]], and [[National Geographic Channel]].

Astra 1A was joined at 19.2°East by [[Astra 1B]] in 1991 and subsequently by [[Astra 1C]] in 1993, establishing SES' principles of co-locating satellites for the provision of transparent backup by each satellite for the others in the group.

The first three satellites at Astra 19.2°E carried only analogue channels in [[PAL]] and [[D2-MAC]]. The fourth satellite, [[Astra 1D]] launched in 1994, was originally intended to carry the first European [[digital TV]] channels but the rapid expansion of satellite television across Europe and demand for analogue TV capacity meant that it was primarily used for analogue signals.

[[Astra 1E]] (1995) was dedicated to digital satellite TV services for Europe and subsequent satellites launched to Astra 19.2°E were also all-digital in the traffic they carried.

Hand-in-hand with the switchover to digital transmission of TV by satellite came a shift to encryption and the targeting of channels to individual countries or regions. The demand for digital TV capacity was so great that SES opened up additional orbital positions to provide for new digital networks aimed at specific countries, starting with [[Astra 28.2°E]] for the UK and Ireland, in 1998. That became the home of Sky Digital, and the last Sky analogue channels left Astra 19.2°E in 2001.

Most Scandinavian broadcasters have migrated from Astra 19.2°E to 1°West and [[Astra 5°E]], and SES has also opened orbital positions of  [[Astra 23.5°E]] and [[Astra 31.5°E]] to cope with the ever-increasing demands for digital capacity and the expanding markets of Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia that are now served by [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites.

[[Image:AustAlpsRegionMap.png|thumb|400px|The subalpine region of mainland Australia (not including Tasmania)]]

The '''Australian Alps montane grasslands''' is a [[Montane grasslands and shrublands|montane grassland]] [[ecoregion]] of south-eastern [[Australia]], restricted to the [[montane]] regions above 1300 metres (the upper altitudinal limit of ''Eucalyptus pauciflora'').
[[File:Mount Ginini - Namadgi National Park - 2.jpg|thumb|right|Mount Ginini in Namadgi National Park]]

==Location and description==
The [[Australian Alps]] occupy less than 0.3% of the Australian landmass and run for 600&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Brindabella Ranges]] near [[Canberra]] along the borders of the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] almost as far as [[Melbourne]]. The highest point is [[Mount Kosciuszko]] (2,228 m) in the [[Snowy Mountains]]. On the Australian mainland these are the south-eastern section of the country's [[Great Dividing Range]] while there are also significant elements of montane grassland in [[Tasmania]]. These mountain areas are notable in Australia, which is mostly flat and dry, and the Alps receive almost a quarter of the country's rainfall and are the water source for almost half of the population. Winters are dark, cold and windy with snow on the ground, with Mount Kosciuszko for example only having 10 frost-free days per year.

On the mainland, the Australian Alps montane grasslands are surrounded at lower elevations by the [[Southeast Australia temperate forests]] ecoregion.

==Flora==
The montane grasslands are a mixed habitat of grassland, [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] and bog that is home to a rich collection of Alpine and other plants adapted to the cold climate, snow and harsh dry winters. The ecoregion can be sub-categorised in to [[montane]] (between 1,100 m and 1,400 m), [[subalpine]] (between 1,400 m and 1,850 m), and [[Alpine tundra|alpine]] (normally above 1,850 m) bands. At lower elevations a number of different types of eucalyptus tree including [[Eucalyptus regnans|mountain ash]] '''(Eucalyptus regnans)'' grow on the rich soils of the mountain valleys while the trees of the subalpine elevations are [[Eucalyptus pauciflora|snow gum]]'' (Eucalyptus pauciflora)''and [[black sallee]]'' (Eucalyptus stellulatea)'' with a ground cover of heath shrubs. The tree line is between 1600 and 1800 m and above that the [[alpine tundra|alpine flora]] consists predominantly of species of'' [[Poa]] ''(snow grass), usually associated with closed and open shrublands of [[orites]], ''[[Grevillea]], [[Prostanthera]]'', and ''[[Hovea]]''. At the highest alpine elevations, these mosaics may give way to a [[feldmark]] or, in zones where snow lies into the summer months, to a [[snow patch community]]. [[Sphagnum]] [[bog]] communities of ''[[Sphagnum cristatum]]'' and ''[[Empodisma minus]]'' (spreading rope-rush) occur in stream beds or other low-lying areas.

The occurrence of grasslands represents an ecological climax condition, the culmination of a cycle of colonisation of bare ground by woody shrubs which provide protection for seedlings of grass species. The shrubs senesce after 40 to 50 years, leaving a closed [[canopy (forest)|canopy]].

==Fauna==
Although this is a harsh environment there is much endemic wildlife in the Alps including the chameleon-like [[Alpine thermocolor grasshopper]], [[mountain pygmy possum]] (''Burramys parvus'') and the [[corroboree frog]] (''Pseudophryne corroboree''). One particularly restricted range species is the [[Baw Baw frog]] (''Philoria frosti'') which only lives on the [[Baw Baw National Park|Baw Baw Plateau]] in Victoria. The larger mammals of the lower elevations include [[red-necked wallaby]] ''(Macropus rufogriseus)'', [[swamp wallaby]] ''(Wallabia bicolor)'', [[common wombat]] ''(Vombatus ursinus)'', [[tiger quoll]] ''(Dasyurus maculatus)'', [[short-beaked echidna]] ''(Tachyglossus aculeatus)'' and [[platypus]] ''(Ornithorhynchus anatinus)''.

==Threats and preservation==
This is an ecoregion generally thought to have experienced long periods of minimal disturbance prior to European settlement. Since the nineteenth century, grazing and an increased incidence of fire resulted in a reduction in range condition, and extensive damage to bog communities, from which plant communities have been slow to recover. However the Alps have long been protected as national parkland in order to preserve the water sources and most of the region is now contained in large contiguous National Parks. These include [[Brindabella National Park|Brindabella]] and [[Namadgi National Park]] and [[Bimberi Nature Reserve|Bimberi]] and [[Scabby Range Nature Reserve]]s near Canberra, [[Kosciuszko National Park|Kosciuszko]] in New South Wales, and [[Alpine National Park|Alpine]] and [[Snowy River National Park]]s and the [[Avon Wilderness Park]] in Victoria. This parkland which does suffer litter, trampling of wildlife and other damage associated with tourism including the clearance of parkland to create ski resorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa1001|name=Australian Alps montane grasslands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bhāgīrathī''' (Pron:/ˌbʌgɪˈɹɑːθɪ/) is a turbulent [[Himalaya]]n river in the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]], and one of the two [[headstream]]s (or source) of the [[Ganges]], the major river of Northern India and considered holy in [[Hinduism]]. In [[Hinduism|Hindu]] faith and culture, the [[Bhagirathi]] is considered the [[headstream|source stream]] of the Ganges. However, in [[hydrology]], the other headstream, [[Alaknanda River|Alaknanda]], is considered the source stream on account of its great length and discharge.

The word "Bhagirathi" ([[Sanskrit]], literally, "caused by [[Bhagiratha]]") refers to a [[mythology|mythological]] [[Sagar caste|Sagar]] Dynasty prince who, to gain the release of his 60,000 great-uncles from the curse of saint [[Kapila]], brought the goddess ''[[Ganga (goddess)|Ganga]]'' in the form of the river Ganges, from the heavens to the earth. Hence, Ganges considered as the daughter of Bhagiratha and Ganges also called Baghirathi. &lt;ref&gt;Mankodi, Kirit (1973) "Gaṅgā Tripathagā"''Artibus Asiae'' 35(1/2): pp. 139-144, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Bhagiratha was the king of [[Kosala]], a [[Kingdoms of Ancient India|kingdom in ancient India]]. He was a descendant of the great King Sagara of the [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]], or Surya Dynasty. He was one of the forefathers of Lord [[Rama]], of the [[Ramayana]], the epic in which Bhagiratha's tale is primarily recounted.The story of Bhagiratha explained in Balakhanda of Ramayana.Shiva brought Ganga river to Bindu Sarovar on request of Bhagiratha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 76|editor=K.S.

==Course==
The [[headwaters]] of the Bhagirathi are formed at [[Gaumukh]] (elevation {{convert|3892|m|ft}}), at the foot of the [[Gangotri glacier]] and [[Khatling glacier]]s in the [[Garhwal Division|Garhwal]] Himalaya. It is then joined by its [[tributaries]]; these are, in order from the source: 
*''Kedar Ganga'' at [[Gangotri]] (elevation {{convert|3049|m|ft|abbr=on}}),
*''[[Jahnavi River|Jadh Ganga]]'' at [[Bhaironghati]] (elevation {{convert|2650|m|ft|abbr=on}}),
*''Kakora Gad'' and ''Jalandhari Gad'' near [[Harsil]] (elevation {{convert|2745|m|ft|abbr=on}}),
*''Siyan Gad'' near [[Jhala]] (elevation {{convert|2575|m|ft|abbr=on}}),
*''Asi Ganga'' near [[Uttarkashi]] (elevation {{convert|1158|m|ft|abbr=on}}),
*''[[Bhilangna River]]'' near [[Tehri|Old Tehri]] (elevation {{convert|755|m|ft|abbr=on}}).

The ''Bhilangna'' itself rises at the foot of the Khatling Glacier (elevation {{convert|3717|m|ft|abbr=on}}) approximately {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Gaumukh.

The river flows from its source for {{convert|205|km|mi|abbr=on}} before meeting the [[Alaknanda River]] at an elevation of {{convert|475|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the town of [[Devprayag]]. Downstream of this confluence, considered holy by [[Hindu]]s, the river is known as the [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga Ji]], or [[Ganges River]] by westerners. The controversial [[Tehri dam]] lies at the confluence of the Bhāgirathi and the Bhilangna, at {{coord|30|22|32|N|78|28|48|E}}, near Tehri.[[Chaukhamba| Chaukhamba I]] is the highest point of the Bhagirathi basin.

'''Brain-to-body mass ratio''', also known as the '''brain-to-body weight ratio''', is the ratio of brain mass to body mass, which is hypothesized to be a rough estimate of the [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] of an [[animal]], although fairly inaccurate in many cases. A more complex [[measurement]], [[encephalization quotient]], takes into account [[allometric]] effects of widely divergent body sizes across several [[taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci102/lectures/intelligence.htm |title=Development of Intelligence |publisher=Ircamera.as.arizona.edu |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=3207484 | pmid=22065955 | doi=10.3389/fnhum.2011.00108 | volume=5 | title=External measures of cognition | journal=Front Hum Neurosci | pages=108 | last1 = Cairό | first1 = O}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raw brain-to-body mass ratio is however simpler to come by, and is still a useful tool for comparing [[encephalization]] within species or between fairly closely related species.

[[Brain size]] usually [[correlation|increases]] with body size in animals (i.e. large animals usually have larger brains than smaller animals);&lt;ref name="brynmawr"/&gt; the relationship is not, however, linear. Small mammals such as [[mice]] may have a brain/body ratio similar to humans, while [[elephants]] have a comparatively lower brain/body ratio.&lt;ref name="brynmawr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In animals, it is thought that the larger the brain, the more brain weight will be available for more complex [[cognition|cognitive]] tasks. However, large animals need more neurons to represent their own bodies and control specific muscles; thus, relative rather than absolute brain size makes for a ranking of animals that better coincides with the observed complexity of animal behaviour. The relationship between brain-to-body mass ratio and complexity of behaviour is not perfect as other factors also influence intelligence, like the evolution of the recent [[cerebral cortex]] and different degrees of brain folding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/kinser/Int4.html |title=Cortical Folding and Intelligence | accessdate=2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which increase the surface of the cortex, which is [[correlation|positively correlated]] in humans to intelligence. The noted exception to this, of course, is swelling of the brain which, while resulting in greater surface area, does not alter the intelligence of those suffering from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haier | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Jung | first2 = R.E. | last3 = Yeo | first3 = R.C. | last4 = Head | first4 = K. | last5 = Alkired | first5 = M.T. | year = 2004 | title = Structural brain variation and general intelligence | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 425–433 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.04.025 | pmid=15325390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to metabolism===

The relationship between brain weight and body weight of all living vertebrates follows two completely separate linear functions for [[Thermoregulation|cold-blooded and warm-blooded]] animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brainmuseum.org/evolution/paleo/index.html A graph of the relation between brain weight and body weight of living vertebrates] Retrieved 10 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Cold-blooded vertebrates have much smaller brains than warm-blooded vertebrates of the same size. However, if [[Brain#Physiology|brain metabolism]] is taken into account, the brain-to-body relationship of both warm and cold-blooded vertebrates becomes similar, with most using between 2 and 8 percent of their basal metabolism for the brain and spinal cord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture-of-peace.info/brain/Relation_of_CNS_to_Body_Metabolism.png A graph of the relation of CNS to body metabolism in vertebrates] Retrieved 10 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dolphin]]s have the highest brain-to-body weight ratio of all [[cetaceans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Marino, L. |author2= Sol, D. |author3= Toren, K. |author4= Lefebvre, L. |last-author-amp= yes|year= 2006 |title= Does diving limit brain size in cetaceans? |journal= Marine Mammal Science |volume= 22 |issue= 2 |pages= 413–425|url= http://biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/lefebvre/articles/Marinoetal_2006.pdf|doi= 10.1111/j.1748-7692.2006.00042.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Monitor lizard]]s, [[tegu]]s and [[anole]]s and some [[tortoise]] species have the largest among reptiles. Among birds, the highest brain-to-body ratios are found among [[parrot]]s, [[crow]]s, [[magpie]]s, [[jay]]s and [[raven]]s. Among amphibians, the studies are still limited. Either [[octopus]]es&lt;ref name="Gould 1977 Ever since Darwin, c7s1"&gt;Gould (1977) Ever since Darwin, c7s1&lt;/ref&gt; or [[jumping spider]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tolweb.org/accessory/Jumping_Spider_Vision?acc_id=1946 |title=Jumping Spider Vision | accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; have some of the highest for an [[invertebrate]], although some [[ant]] species have 14%-15% of their mass in their brains, the highest value known for any animal. [[Shark]]s have one of the highest for [[fish]] alongside [[manta ray]]s (although the electrogenic [[Mormyridae|elephantfish]] has a ratio nearly 80 times higher - about 1/32,  which is slightly higher than that for humans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Nilsson, Göran E.|year= 1996 |title= Brain And Body Oxygen Requirements Of Gnathonemus Petersii, A Fish With An Exceptionally Large Brain |journal= The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume= 199|pages= 603–607|url= http://jeb.biologists.org/content/199/3/603.full.pdf |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Treeshrew]]s have a higher [[brain to body mass ratio]] than any other mammal, including [[human]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://genome.wustl.edu/genomes/view/tupaia_belangeri is an article on Tupaia belangeri from The Genome Institute published by Washington University, archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20100601201841/https://www.genome.wustl.edu/genomes/view/tupaia_belangeri&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shrew]]s {{clarify |date=September 2018 |reason= True Shrews or Tree Shrews?}} hold about 10% of their body mass in their brain.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

It is a trend that the larger the animal gets, the smaller the brain-to-body mass ratio is. Large [[whale]]s have very small brains compared to their weight, and small [[rodent]]s like [[mouse|mice]] have a relatively large brain, giving a brain-to-body mass ratio similar to humans.&lt;ref name="brynmawr" /&gt; One explanation could be that as an animal's brain gets larger, the size of the neural cells remains the same, and more nerve cells will cause the brain to increase in size to a lesser degree than the rest of the body. This phenomenon can be described by an equation of the form '''''E = CS&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;''''', where ''E'' and ''S'' are brain and body weights, ''r'' a constant that depends on animal family (but close to 2/3 in many vertebrates&lt;ref name="PagelHarvey1989"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pagel M. D., Harvey P. H. |year= 1989 |title= Taxonomic differences in the scaling of brain on body weight among mammals
|journal= Science |volume= 244|pages= 1589–93|bibcode= 1989Sci...244.1589P|doi= 10.1126/science.2740904}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and ''C'' is the cephalization factor.&lt;ref name="Gould 1977 Ever since Darwin, c7s1" /&gt; It has been argued that the animal's ecological niche, rather than its evolutionary family, is the main determinant of its encephalization factor ''C''.&lt;ref name="PagelHarvey1989" /&gt;

In the essay "Bligh's Bounty",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au/~tzvi/GOULD.html |title=Bligh's Bounty |accessdate=2011-05-12 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20010709234346/http://yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au/~tzvi/GOULD.html |archivedate= 2001-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Jay Gould]] noted that if one looks at vertebrates with very low encephalization quotient, their brains are slightly less massive than their spinal cords. Theoretically, intelligence might correlate with the absolute amount of brain an animal has after subtracting the weight of the spinal cord from the brain. This formula is useless for invertebrates because they do not have spinal cords, or in some cases, central nervous systems.

== Criticism ==
Recent research indicates that, in non-human primates, whole [[brain size]] is a better measure of cognitive abilities than brain-to-body mass ratio. The total weight of the species is greater than the predicted sample only if the frontal lobe is adjusted for spatial relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 2007 | title = Overall Brain Size, and Not Encephalization Quotient, Best Predicts Cognitive Ability across Non-Human Primates | url = | journal = Brain Behav Evol | volume = 70 | issue = | pages = 115–124 | doi = 10.1159/000102973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain-to-body mass ratio was however found to be an excellent predictor of variation in problem solving abilities among [[carnivora|carnivoran mammals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benson-Amram|first1=S.|last2=Dantzer|first2=B.|last3=Stricker|first3=G.|last4=Swanson|first4=E.M.|last5=Holekamp|first5=K.E.|title=Brain size predicts problem-solving ability in mammalian carnivores|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=25 January 2016|pages=201505913|doi=10.1073/pnas.1505913113|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/01/20/1505913113.full.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2016|volume=113|pmid=26811470|pmc=4780594|bibcode=2016PNAS..113.2532B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, the brain to body weight ratio can vary greatly from person to person; it would be much higher in an underweight person than an overweight person, and higher in infants than adults. The same problem is encountered when dealing with marine mammals, which may have considerable body fat masses. Some researchers therefore prefer lean body weight to brain mass as a better predictor.

The BRN is used frequently in meteorology due to widely available [[Radiosonde|rawinsonde]] (frequently called radiosonde) data and numerical weather forecasts that supply wind and temperature measurements at discrete points in space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Boundary Layer Meteorology|last = Stull|first = Roland|publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers|year = |isbn = 978-90-277-2769-5|location = 101 Philip Drive, Norwell, MA 02061, USA|pages = 177–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formula==
Below is the formula for the BRN. Where g is [[gravitational acceleration]], ''T&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' is absolute [[virtual temperature]], Δθ&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[virtual potential temperature]] difference across a layer of thickness Δ''z'' (vertical depth), and Δ''U'' and Δ''V'' are the changes in horizontal wind components across that same layer.&lt;ref name="ams glossary"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Bulk richardson number |url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Bulk_richardson_number |work=AMS Glossary |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;
R_{B} = \frac{(g/T_{v})\Delta\theta_{v}\Delta z}{(\Delta U)^2 + (\Delta V)^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Critical values and interpretation ==
High values indicate unstable and/or weakly-sheared environments; low values indicate weak instability and/or strong vertical shear. Generally, values in the range of around 10 to 50 suggest environmental conditions favorable for [[supercell]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Glossary |url = http://w1.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=b |accessdate=2015-12-29 |language = EN-US |publisher = [[NOAA National Weather Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the limit of layer thickness becoming small, the Bulk Richardson number approaches the Gradient Richardson number, for which a critical Richardson number is roughly Ri&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;= 0.25. Numbers less than this critical value are dynamically unstable and likely to become or remain turbulent.&lt;ref name="ams glossary" /&gt;

The critical value of 0.25 applies only for local gradients, not for finite differences across thick layers. The thicker the layer is the more likely we are to average out large gradients that occur within small sub-regions of the layer of interest. This results in uncertainty of our prediction of the occurrence of turbulence, and now one must use an artificially large value of the critical Richardson number to give reasonable results using our smoothed gradients. This means that the thinner the layer, the closer the value to the theory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Cauca Valley dry forests''' is a [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] in [[Colombia]].

== Location ==
The Cauca Valley dry forests occupies an area of {{convert|7,300|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, extending in a long, narrow strip along the [[Cauca River]]. The Cauca Valley is nestled between the [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|Cordillera Occidental]] and [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Cordillera Central]] in the northern [[Andes]]. These ranges create a [[rain shadow]], which makes the Cauca Valley drier than the surrounding forests. The Cauca Valley dry forests lie below 1000 meters elevation; the higher slopes are occupied by the distinct [[Cauca Valley montane forests]].  Most of these forests have been cleared for agriculture over the years making it one of the most critically endangered ecoregions in Colombia.  [[Laguna de Sonso Nature Reserve]] has a small area of protected forest.

== Ecology ==
{{see also|Biodiversity of Colombia}}
The ecoregion is part of the {{convert|103,000|km2}} Tumbesian-Andean Valleys Dry Forests global ecoregion, which holds six terrestrial ecoregions: [[Tumbes-Piura dry forests]], [[Ecuadorian dry forests]], [[Patía Valley dry forests]], [[Magdalena Valley dry forests]], Cauca Valley dry forests and [[Marañón dry forests]]. 
The fauna and flora of the global ecoregion have high levels of endemism.{{sfn|Schafer}}

=== Flora ===
The main plant communities are open woodland, deciduous dry forest, evergreen dry forest, riparian forest, arid scrub and wetlands. The natural vegetation has been almost completely displaced by human activities, chiefly agriculture.

=== Fauna ===
Three endemic or near-endemic birds found in the ecoregion are the [[white-chested swift]] ''(Cypseloides lemosi)'', [[grayish piculet]] ''(Picumnus granadensis)'', [[apical flycatcher]] ''(Myiarchus apicalis)''.

== Human use ==
The Cauca Valley dry forests have been mostly converted to agricultural fields. The city of [[Cali]] lies in the ecoregion.

'''DXing''' is the hobby of receiving and identifying distant [[radio]] or [[Terrestrial television|television]] signals, or making two way radio contact with distant stations in [[amateur radio]], [[citizens' band radio]] or other two way radio communications. Many DXers also attempt to obtain written verifications of reception or contact, sometimes referred to as "[[QSL card|QSL]]s" or "veries". The name of the hobby comes from DX, [[telegraph]]ic [[shorthand]] for "distance" or "distant".&lt;ref name="Intro_DX"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dxing.info/introduction.dx |title=''Introduction To DXing'' |author=Mika Mäkeläinen |publisher=DXing.info |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of DXing arose during the early days of [[radio broadcasting]]. Listeners would mail "reception reports" to radio broadcasting stations in hopes of getting a written acknowledgement or a QSL card that served to officially verify they had heard a distant station. Collecting these cards became popular with radio listeners in the 1920s and 1930s, and reception reports were often used by early broadcasters to gauge the effectiveness of their transmissions. Although international shortwave broadcasts are on the decline, DXing remains popular among dedicated shortwave listeners. The pursuit of two-way contact between distant amateur radio operators is also a significant activity within the amateur radio hobby.&lt;ref name="Berg2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jerome S. Berg |title=Listening on the Short Waves, 1945 to Today |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjP978PYo0MC&amp;pg=PA330 |accessdate=November 12, 2016 |date=30 October 2008 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3996-6 |pages=330–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Susan J.

== Types of DXing ==
=== AM radio DX ===
{{Main|MW DX}}

Early radio listeners, often using home made [[crystal set]]s and long wire antennas, found radio stations few and far between. With the broadcast bands uncrowded, signals of the most powerful stations could be heard over hundreds of miles, but weaker signals required more precise tuning or better receiving gear.

By the 1950s, and continuing through the mid-1970s, many of the most powerful [[North America]]n "[[Clear-channel stations|clear channel]]" stations such as [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]], [[WLW]], [[CKLW]], [[CHUM (AM)|CHUM]], [[WABC (AM)|WABC]], [[WJR]], [[WLS (AM)|WLS]], [[WWKB|WKBW]], [[KFI]], [[KAAY]], [[KSL (radio)|KSL]] and a host of [[border blaster]]s from [[Mexico]] pumped out [[Top 40]] music played by popular [[disc jockey]]s. As most smaller, local [[AM radio]] stations had to sign off at night, the big 50 [[kilowatt|kW]] stations had loyal listeners hundreds of miles away.

The popularity of DXing the medium-wave band has diminished as the [[popular music]] formats quickly migrated to the clearer, though less propagating, [[FM radio]] beginning in the 1970s. Meanwhile, the MW band in the [[United States]] was getting more and more crowded with new stations and existing stations receiving [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC authorization]] to operate at night. In [[Canada]], just the opposite occurred as AM stations began moving to FM beginning in the 1980s and continuing through today.

Outside of the Americas and Australia, most AM radio broadcasting was in the form of synchronous networks of government-operated stations, operating with hundreds, even thousands of kilowatts of power. Still, the lower powered stations and occasional trans-oceanic signal were popular DX targets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dxing.com/amband.htm ''AM Band DXing'', DXing.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shortwave DX ===
{{main|Shortwave listening}}
Especially during wartime and times of conflict, reception of international broadcasters, whose signals propagate around the world on the [[shortwave bands]] has been popular with both casual listeners and DXing hobbyists.

With the rise in popularity of [[streaming audio]] over the internet, many international broadcasters (including the [[BBC]] and [[Voice of America]]) have cut back on their shortwave broadcasts. [[Missionary]] [[Religious broadcasting|Religious broadcasters]] still make extensive use of [[shortwave radio]] to reach less developed countries around the world.

In addition to international broadcasters, the shortwave bands also are home to [[military communication]]s, [[radioteletype|RTTY]], [[amateur radio]], [[pirate radio]], and the mysterious broadcasts of [[numbers station]]s. Many of these signals are transmitted in single [[Sideband|side band]] mode, which requires the use of specialized receivers more suitable to DXing than to casual listening.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dxing.info/introduction.dx ''Introduction To DXing''. DXing.info&lt;/ref&gt;

=== VHF DXing ===
{{Main|TV-FM DX}}

Though sporadic in nature, signals on the FM broadcast and [[VHF]] [[television]] bands - especially those stations at the lower end of these bands - can "skip" for hundreds, even thousands of miles. North American FM stations have been received in [[Western Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hattam|first1=Mark|title=Trans-Atlantic FM|url=http://www.dxradio.co.uk/transatlanticfm.php|website=dxradio.co.uk|publisher=DX Radio|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and European TV signals have been received on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast of the U.S.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio-electronics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=psUpAQAAMAAJ|year=1959|publisher=Gernsback Publications.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police, fire, and military communications on the VHF bands are also DX'ed to some extent on multi-band [[radio scanner]]s, though they are mainly listened to strictly on a local basis. One difficulty is in identifying the exact origins of communications of this nature, as opposed to commercial broadcasters which must identify themselves at the top of each hour, and can often be identified through mentions of sponsors, slogans, etc. throughout their programming.

=== Amateur radio DX ===
{{main|Amateur radio}}
[[Amateur radio operator]]s who specialize in making two way radio contact with other amateurs in distant countries are also referred to as "DXers". On the [[high frequency|HF]] (also known as [[shortwave]]) amateur bands, DX stations are those in foreign [[country|countries]]. On the [[very high frequency|VHF]]/[[ultra high frequency|UHF]] amateur bands, DX stations can be within the same [[country]] or [[continent]], since making a long-distance VHF contact, without the help of a [[satellite]], can be very difficult. DXers collect QSL cards as proof of contact and can earn special certificates and awards from amateur radio organizations.&lt;ref name="GregorySahre2003" /&gt; 

In addition, many [[Club (organization)|clubs]] offer awards for communicating with a certain number of DX stations. For example, the [[American Radio Relay League|ARRL]] offers the [[DX Century Club]] award, or [[DXCC]]. The basic certificate is awarded for working and confirming at least 100 entities on the ARRL DXCC List.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arrl.org/awards/dxcc/dxcclist.txt DXCC List - ARRL&lt;/ref&gt; For award purposes, other areas than just political [[countries]] can be classified as "DX countries". For example, the French territory of [[Reunion Island]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] is counted as a DX country, even though it is a [[Regions of France|region of France]]. The rules for determining what is a DX country can be quite complex and to avoid potential confusion, radio amateurs often use the term ''entity'' instead of country. In addition to entities, some awards are based on [[island]] groups in the world's [[oceans]]. On the [[very high frequency|VHF]]/[[ultra high frequency|UHF]] bands, many radio amateurs pursue awards based on [[Maidenhead grid locator]]s. 

In order to give other amateurs a chance to confirm contacts at new or exotic locations, amateurs have mounted [[DXpedition]]s to countries or regions that have no permanent base of amateur radio operators.&lt;ref name="GregorySahre2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Danny Gregory|author2=Paul Sahre|title=Hello world: a life in ham radio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMhgwa2_s2EC&amp;pg=PA217|accessdate=4 April 2012|date=1 April 2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=978-1-56898-281-6|pages=217–}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also frequent [[contesting|contests]] where radio amateurs operate their stations on certain dates for a fixed period of time to try to communicate with as many DX stations as possible.

== DX Clubs ==
Many radio enthusiasts are members of DX clubs. There are many DX clubs in many countries around the world. They are useful places to find information about up-to-date news relating to international radio. Many people also enjoy social events, which can form a large part of the enjoyment that people can get out of the radio hobby.

== QSL cards ==
{{Main|QSL card}}
[[File:QSL-VOA-Thessaloniki-1972.jpg|thumb|right|QSL card from Voice of America]]
One of the interesting sides of DXing as a hobby is collecting QSL cards (acknowledgement cards from the broadcaster) confirming the listener's reception report (sometimes called SINPO report, see next section).

Usually a QSL card will have a picture on one side and the reception data on the other. Most of the broadcasters will use pictures and messages indicating their country's culture or technological life.

== SINPO report ==
[[SINPO]] stands for the following qualities, graded on a scale of 1 to 5, where '1' means the quality was very bad and '5' very good.

S - Signal strength&lt;br/&gt;
I - Interference with other stations or broadcasters&lt;br/&gt;
N - Noise ratio in the received signal&lt;br/&gt;
P - Propagation (ups and downs of the reception)&lt;br/&gt;
O - Overall merit

Although this is a subjective measure, with practise the grading becomes more consistent, and a particular broadcast may be assessed by several listeners from the same area, in which case the broadcaster could assess correspondence between reports.

After listening to a broadcast, the listener writes a report with SINPO values, typically including his geographical location (called QTH in amateur radio terminology) in longitude and latitude, the types of receiver and antennae used, the frequency the transmission was heard on, a brief description of the programme listened to, their opinion about it, suggestions if any, and so on.

The listener can send the report to the broadcaster either by post or email, and request verification (QSL) from them.

Variants of this report are:
a) the SIO report which omits the Noise and Propagation,
b) grading on a scale of 1 to 3 (instead of 1 to 5) and
c) the SINFO report where the F stands for fading.

== DX Communication ==
'''DX communication''' is communication over large or relatively uncommon distances. On the [[UHF]] or [[VHF]] bands which are typically used for short range or line of sight communications, DX may represent communication with stations 50 or 100 miles away. The UHF and microwave bands have also been used to accomplish [[Earth–Moon–Earth communication]] between stations worldwide.&lt;ref name="Silver2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=H. Ward Silver|title=The ARRL Extra Class License Manual for Ham Radio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EcbjKvhgPLsC&amp;pg=SA2-PA4|year=2008|publisher=American Radio Relay League|isbn=978-0-87259-135-6|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[low frequency]] bands (30 to 300 kHz), contacts between stations separated by more than 100 miles are often considered DX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=73 Amateur Radio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXFVAAAAYAAJ|year=1988|publisher=WGE Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[amateur radio]] operators and [[shortwave listening|shortwave listeners]], most traditional DX communication occurs on the [[high frequency|HF]] bands, where the [[ionosphere]] is used to refract the transmitted [[radio]] beam. The beam returns to the Earth's surface, and may then be reflected back into the ionosphere for a second bounce. Ionospheric refraction is generally only feasible for frequencies below about 50&amp;nbsp;MHz, and is highly dependent upon atmospheric conditions, the time of day, and the eleven-year [[sunspot]] cycle. It is also affected by [[solar flare|solar storms]] and some other solar events, which can alter the Earth's ionosphere by ejecting a shower of charged particles.

The angle of refraction places a minimum on the distance at which the refracted beam will first return to Earth. This distance increases with frequency. As a result, any station employing DX will be surrounded by an annular ''dead zone'' where they can't hear other stations or be heard by them.

This is the phenomenon that allows [[short wave]] radio reception to occur beyond the limits of line of sight. It is utilized by [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts (hams), shortwave broadcast stations (such as [[BBC]] and [[Voice of America]]) and others, and is what allows one to hear AM (MW) stations from areas far from their location. It is one of the backups to failure of long distance communication by satellites, when their operation is affected by [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] storms from the sun.

For example, in clear [[ionosphere]] conditions, one can hear [[France Inter]] on 711 kHz, far into the UK and as far as [[Reading, Berkshire]]. It is also possible to hear [[Radio Australia]] from [[Melbourne]] as far away as [[Lansing, Michigan]], a distance of some 9835 miles (15,827 kilometers).

== DXing equipment ==
Radio equipment used in DXing ranges from inexpensive portable receivers to deluxe equipment costing thousands of dollars. Using just a simple AM radio, one can easily hear signals from the most powerful stations propagating hundreds of miles at night. Even inexpensive [[shortwave radio receiver]]s can receive signals emanating from several countries during any time of day.

Serious hobbyists use more elaborate receivers designed specifically for pulling in distant signals, and often build their own antennas designed for a specific frequency band. There is much discussion and debate in the hobby about the relative merits of lesser priced shortwave receivers vs. their multi-thousand dollar "big brother" radios. In general, a good desktop or "PC Radio" will be able to "hear" just about what a very expensive high-performance receiver can receive. The difference between the two types comes into play during difficult band or reception conditions. The expensive receiver will have more filtering options and usually better [[adjacent channel interference]] blocking, sometimes resulting in the difference of being able to receive or not receive a signal under poor conditions. Reception of [[international broadcasting]] seldom shows a noticeable difference between the two radios. [[Car audio|Car radios]] are also used for DXing the broadcast bands.

Another recent{{When|date=April 2011}} trend is for the hobbyist to employ multiple radios and antennas connected to a personal computer. Through advanced radio control software, the radios can be automatically ganged together, so that tuning one radio can tune all the others in the group. This DXing technique is sometimes referred to as [[diversity scheme|diversity]] reception and facilitates easy "A to B" comparison of different antennas and receivers for a given signal. For more details on "PC Radios" or computer controlled shortwave receivers see the discussion in [[Shortwave listening]].

Having a minimum of two [[Dipole antenna|Dipole antennas]] at right angles to each other (for example, one running North-South and one running East-West) can produce dramatically different reception patterns. These simple antennas can be made for a few dollars worth of wire and a couple of insulators.

'''Desert Camp Conservation Park''' (formerly Desert Camp National Parks Reserve and  Desert Camp National Park) is a [[protected area]] in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] located in the state’s [[Limestone Coast]] region in the gazetted locality of [[Marcollat, South Australia|Marcollat]] about {{convert|44|km}} south of the town centre in [[Keith, South Australia|Keith]].&lt;ref name="PLB"/&gt;

The conservation park occupies land in sections 87 and 105 of [[Lands administrative divisions of South Australia|the cadastral unit]] of the [[Hundred of Marcollat]] on the northern side of Rowney Road which is also known as the Kingston - Keith road.  The land originally gained protected area status on 27 July 1967, when section 87 was gazetted under the ''National Parks Act 1966'' as the ''Desert Camp National Park''.&lt;ref name="SAGG-1967"/&gt;  Its name was amended to ''Desert Camp National Parks Reserve'' on 9 November 1967.&lt;ref name="SAGG-1967a"&gt;{{cite web|last1= Walsh |first1= Frank |title= NATIONAL PARKS ACT, 1966: VARIOUS NATIONAL PARKS NAMED. |url= http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/sa_gazette/1967/51/2043.pdf |website=South Australian Government Gazette|publisher=South Australian Government|accessdate=17 March 2018|page= 2043 |date=9 November 1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 105 came in existence about 14 months later after work to Rowney Road resulted in it being “severed … from an adjoining lease.”  Section 105 was subsequently added ion 21 November 1968 to the national parks reserve.&lt;ref name="SAGG-1968"&gt;{{cite web |last1=DeGaris |first1=R.

In 1992, the conservation park was described as follows:&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(It) is located in the Angle Rock Environmental Association…  This association is characterised by interdunal plains with occasional low narrow dune ridges and isolated granite outcrops.  Soils are moderately deep, alkaline, sandy, pedal, mottled-yellow duplex soils…  These soils support an open woodland of pink gum ''([[Eucalyptus fasciculosa]])'' over a heath understorey of mallee honey-myrtle ''([[Melaleuca brevifolia]])'', broombush ''([[Melaleuca uncinata|M. uncinata]])'', austral grass tree ''([[Xanthorrhoea australis]])'', slaty sheoak ''([[Allocasuarina muelleriana]])'' and desert hakea ''([[Hakea muelleriana]])''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of 1992, there was “limited visitation” with the main visitor groups being “bird observers and field naturalists”.&lt;ref name="mp"/&gt;  

The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III protected area]].&lt;ref name="CAPAD2014SASum"/&gt;  In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct [[Register of the National Estate]].&lt;ref name="NRE"&gt;{{cite AHD|7968| Desert Camp Conservation Park - listing on the now-defunct  Register of the National Estate |date=21 October 1980|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Doppler effect''' (or the '''Doppler shift''') is the change in [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]] of a [[wave]] in relation to an [[observer (physics)|observer]] who is moving relative to the wave source.&lt;ref name="Giordano"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the [[Austria]]n physicist [[Christian Doppler]], who described the phenomenon in 1842.

A common example of Doppler shift is the change of [[pitch (music)|pitch]] heard when a [[vehicle]] sounding a horn approaches and recedes from an observer. Compared to the emitted frequency, the received frequency is higher during the approach, identical at the instant of passing by, and lower during the recession.&lt;ref name="Possel"&gt;{{cite web

The reason for the Doppler effect is that when the source of the waves is moving towards the observer, each successive wave [[Crest (physics)|crest]] is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the previous wave.&lt;ref name="Possel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, each wave takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous wave. Hence, the time between the arrival of successive wave crests at the observer is reduced, causing an increase in the frequency. While they are traveling, the distance between successive wave fronts is reduced, so the waves "bunch together".  Conversely, if the source of waves is moving away from the observer, each wave is emitted from a position farther from the observer than the previous wave, so the arrival time between successive waves is increased, reducing the frequency. The distance between successive wave fronts is then increased, so the waves "spread out".

For waves that propagate in a medium, such as [[sound]] waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted.&lt;ref name="Giordano" /&gt; The total Doppler effect may therefore result from motion of the source, motion of the observer, or motion of the medium. Each of these effects is analyzed separately. For waves which do not require a medium, such as [[light]] or [[gravity]] in [[general relativity]], only the relative difference in velocity between the observer and the source needs to be considered.

==History==
Doppler first proposed this effect in 1842 in his treatise "''[[Über das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels]]''" (On the coloured light of the [[binary stars]] and some other stars of the heavens).&lt;ref name="AlecEden"&gt;Alec Eden ''The search for Christian Doppler'', Springer-Verlag, Wien 1992. Contains a facsimile edition with an [[English language|English]] translation.&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was tested for sound waves by [[C. H. D. Buys Ballot|Buys Ballot]] in 1845.&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{cite journal | last=Buys Ballot | title=Akustische Versuche auf der Niederländischen Eisenbahn, nebst gelegentlichen Bemerkungen zur Theorie des Hrn. Prof. Doppler (in German) | journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie | date=1845 | volume=11 | issue=11 | pages=321–351 | doi=10.1002/andp.18451421102|bibcode = 1845AnP...142..321B }}&lt;/ref&gt; He confirmed that the sound's [[Pitch (music)#Pitch and frequency|pitch]] was higher than the emitted frequency when the sound source approached him, and lower than the emitted frequency when the sound source receded from him. [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] discovered independently the same phenomenon on [[electromagnetic wave]]s in 1848 (in France, the effect is sometimes called "effet Doppler-Fizeau" but that name was not adopted by the rest of the world as Fizeau's discovery was six years after Doppler's proposal).&lt;ref group=p&gt;Fizeau: "Acoustique et optique". ''Lecture, [[Philomatic Society|Société Philomathique]] de Paris'', 29 December 1848. According to Becker(pg. 109), this was never published, but recounted by M. Moigno(1850): "Répertoire d'optique moderne" (in French), vol 3. pp 1165–1203 and later in full by Fizeau, "Des effets du mouvement sur le ton des vibrations sonores et sur la longeur d'onde des rayons de lumière"; [Paris, 1870].

==General==

In classical physics, where the speeds of source and the receiver relative to the medium are lower than the velocity of waves in the medium, the relationship between observed frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and emitted frequency &lt;math&gt;f_\text{0}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:&lt;ref name=encphysci&gt;{{cite book

::&lt;math&gt;f = \left( \frac{c \pm v_\text{r}}{c \pm v_\text{s}} \right) f_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;c \;&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of waves in the medium;
::&lt;math&gt;v_\text{r} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the receiver relative to the medium; positive if the receiver is moving towards the source (and negative in the other direction);
::&lt;math&gt;v_\text{s} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the source relative to the medium; positive if the source is moving away from the receiver (and negative in the other direction).

The frequency is decreased if either is moving away from the other.

The above formula assumes that the source is either directly approaching or receding from the observer. If the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant velocity), the observed frequency that is first heard is higher than the object's emitted frequency. Thereafter, there is a [[monotonic]] decrease in the observed frequency as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when it is coming from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted at the point of closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt. When the observer is far from the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.

If the speeds &lt;math&gt;v_\text{s} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_\text{r} \,&lt;/math&gt; are small compared to the speed of the wave, the relationship between observed frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and emitted frequency &lt;math&gt;f_\text{0}&lt;/math&gt; is approximately&lt;ref name=encphysci /&gt;

|}

:where
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta f = f - f_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta v = v_\text{r} - v_\text{s} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the receiver relative to the source: it is positive when the source and the receiver are moving towards each other.

{{hidden begin|title=Proof|toggle=left}}
Given &lt;math&gt;f = \left( \frac{c + v_\text{r}}{c + v_\text{s}} \right) f_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

we divide for &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f = \left( \frac{1 + \frac{v_\text{r}} {c}} {1 + \frac{v_\text{s}} {c}} \right) f_0  = \left( 1 + \frac{v_\text{r}}{c} \right) \left( \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_\text{s}} {c}} \right) f_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\frac{v_\text{s}}{c} \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; we can substitute the geometric expansion:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{1} {1 + \frac{v_\text{s}}{c}} \approx 1 - \frac{v_\text{s}}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

==Analysis==
To understand what happens, consider the following analogy. Someone throws one ball every second at a man. Assume that balls travel with constant velocity. If the thrower is stationary, the man will receive one ball every second. However, if the thrower is moving towards the man, he will receive balls more frequently because the balls will be less spaced out. The inverse is true if the thrower is moving away from the man. So it is actually the ''wavelength'' which is affected; as a consequence, the received frequency is also affected. It may also be said that the velocity of the wave remains constant whereas wavelength changes; hence frequency also changes.

With an observer stationary relative to the medium, if a moving source is emitting waves with an actual frequency &lt;math&gt;f_\text{0}&lt;/math&gt; (in this case, the wavelength is changed, the transmission velocity of the wave keeps constant &lt;math&gt;\text{--}&lt;/math&gt; note that the ''transmission velocity'' of the wave does not depend on the ''velocity of the source''), then the observer detects waves with a frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;f = \left ( \frac {c}{c \pm v_\text{s}} \right ) f_0&lt;/math&gt;

A similar analysis for a moving ''observer'' and a stationary source (in this case, the wavelength keeps constant, but due to the motion, the rate at which the observer receives waves &lt;math&gt;\text{--}&lt;/math&gt; and hence the ''transmission velocity'' of the wave [with respect to the observer] &lt;math&gt;\text{--}&lt;/math&gt; is changed) yields the observed frequency:

:&lt;math&gt;f = \left ( \frac {c \pm v_\text{r}}{c} \right ) f_0&lt;/math&gt;

These can be generalized into the equation that was presented in the previous section.

:&lt;math&gt;f = \left ( \frac {c\pm v_\text{r}}{c \pm v_\text{s}} \right ) f_0&lt;/math&gt;

An interesting effect was predicted by Lord Rayleigh in his classic book on sound: if the source is moving toward the observer at twice the speed of sound, a musical piece emitted by that source would be heard in correct time and tune, but ''backwards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strutt (Lord Rayleigh)|first=John William|title=The Theory of Sound|editor=MacMillan &amp; Co|date=1896|edition=2|volume=2|pages=154|url=https://archive.org/stream/theorysound02raylgoog#page/n176/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Doppler effect with sound is only clearly heard with objects moving at high speed, as change in frequency of musical tone involves a speed of around 40 meters per second, and smaller changes in frequency can easily be confused by changes in the amplitude of the sounds from moving emitters.  Neil A Downie has demonstrated &lt;ref&gt;Downie, Neil A, 'Vacuum Bazookas, Electric Rainbow Jelly and 27 other projects for Saturday Science', Princeton (2001) {{ISBN|0-691-00986-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; how the Doppler effect can be made much more easily audible by using an ultrasonic (e.g. 40&amp;nbsp;kHz) emitter on the moving object. The observer then uses a heterodyne frequency converter, as used in many bat detectors, to listen to a band around 40&amp;nbsp;kHz. In this case, with the bat detector tuned to give frequency for the stationary emitter of 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz, the observer will perceive a frequency shift of a whole tone, 240&amp;nbsp;Hz, if the emitter travels at 2 meters per second.

==Application==

===Sirens===
[[File:Juli 2016 - Spoedtransport, Huisarts, Brandweer, Politie en Ambulances met spoed in Rotterdam -451.webm|start=7:14|end=8:30|thumb|Sirens on passing emergency vehicles.]]
The [[siren (alarm)|siren]] on a passing [[emergency vehicle]] will start out higher than its stationary pitch, slide down as it passes, and continue lower than its stationary pitch as it recedes from the observer. Astronomer [[John Dobson (astronomer)|John Dobson]] explained the effect thus:

:"The reason the siren slides is because it doesn't hit you."

In other words, if the siren approached the observer directly, the pitch would remain constant, at a higher than stationary pitch, until the vehicle hit him, and then immediately jump to a new lower pitch. Because the vehicle passes by the observer, the radial velocity does not remain constant, but instead varies as a function of the angle between his line of sight and the siren's velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;v_\text{radial}=v_\text{s}\cdot \cos{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the object's forward velocity and the line of sight from the object to the observer.

===Astronomy===
[[Image:Redshift.svg|thumb|upright|[[Redshift]] of [[spectral line]]s in the [[optical spectrum]] of a supercluster of distant galaxies (right), as compared to that of the Sun (left)]]

The [[Relativistic Doppler effect|Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves]] such as light is of great use in [[astronomy]] and results in either a so-called [[redshift]] or [[blueshift]]. It has been used to measure the speed at which [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] are approaching or receding from us; that is, their [[radial velocity|radial velocities]]. This may be used to detect if an apparently single star is, in reality, a close [[Binary star|binary]], to measure the rotational speed of stars and galaxies, or to [[Doppler spectroscopy|detect exoplanets]]. This redshift and blueshift happens on a very small scale, if an object is moving toward earth, there would not be a noticeable difference in visible light &lt;ref&gt;http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/doppler.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that redshift is also used to measure the [[Redshift#Expansion of space|expansion of space]], but that this is not truly a Doppler effect.&lt;ref&gt; The distinction is made clear in {{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Edward Robert  |date= 2000 |title=Cosmology: The Science of the Universe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8PJbcA2lLoC&amp;pg=PA315|pages=306''ff'' |isbn=978-0-521-66148-5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, redshifting due to the expansion of space is known as [[cosmological redshift]], which can be derived purely from the [[Robertson-Walker metric]] under the formalism of [[General Relativity]]. Having said this, it also happens that there ''are'' detectable Doppler effects on cosmological scales, which, if incorrectly interpreted as cosmological in origin, lead to the observation of [[redshift-space distortions]].&lt;ref&gt; An excellent review of the topic in technical detail is given here: {{cite journal|last1=Percival|first1=Will|last2=Samushia|first2=Lado|last3=Ross|first3=Ashley|last4=Shapiro|first4=Charles|last5=Raccanelli|first5=Alvise|date= 2011 |title=Review article: Redshift-space distortions|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=369|issue=1957|pages=5058–67|doi=10.1098/rsta.2011.0370|pmid=22084293|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roypta/369/1957/5058.full.pdf|bibcode=2011RSPTA.369.5058P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the Doppler effect for light in [[astronomy]] depends on our knowledge that the [[electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectra]] of stars are not homogeneous. They exhibit [[spectral line|absorption lines]] at well defined frequencies that are correlated with the energies required to excite [[electron]]s in various [[Chemical element|elements]] from one level to another. The Doppler effect is recognizable in the fact that the absorption lines are not always at the frequencies that are obtained from the spectrum of a stationary light source. Since blue light has a higher frequency than red light, the spectral lines of an approaching astronomical light source exhibit a blueshift and those of a receding astronomical light source exhibit a redshift.

Among the [[List of nearest stars|nearby stars]], the largest radial velocities with respect to the [[Sun]] are +308&amp;nbsp;km/s ([[BD-15°4041]], also known as LHS 52, 81.7 light-years away) and −260&amp;nbsp;km/s ([[Woolley 9722]], also known as Wolf 1106 and LHS 64, 78.2 light-years away). Positive radial velocity means the star is receding from the Sun, negative that it is approaching.

===Radar===
{{Main article|Doppler radar}}

The Doppler effect is used in some types of [[radar]], to measure the velocity of detected objects. A radar beam is fired at a moving target — e.g. a motor car, as police use radar to detect speeding motorists — as it approaches or recedes from the radar source. Each successive radar wave has to travel farther to reach the car, before being reflected and re-detected near the source. As each wave has to move farther, the gap between each wave increases, increasing the wavelength. In some situations, the radar beam is fired at the moving car as it approaches, in which case each successive wave travels a lesser distance, decreasing the wavelength. In either situation, calculations from the Doppler effect accurately determine the car's velocity. Moreover, the [[proximity fuze]], developed during World War II, relies upon Doppler radar to detonate explosives at the correct time, height, distance, etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Because the doppler shift affects the wave incident upon the target as well as the wave reflected back to the radar, the change in frequency observed by a radar due to a target moving at [[relative velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; is twice that from the same target emitting a wave:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f=\frac{2\Delta v}{c}f_0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu/11.coherent/co06.en.html|title=Radar Basics|first=Dipl.-Ing. (FH) Christian|last=Wolff|date=|website=www.radartutorial.eu|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical===
{{Main article|Doppler ultrasonography}}
[[File:CarotidDoppler1.jpg|thumb|upright|Colour flow ultrasonography (Doppler) of a [[carotid artery]] – scanner and screen]]
An [[echocardiogram]] can, within certain limits, produce an accurate assessment of the direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. One of the limitations is that the [[ultrasound]] beam should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible. Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, abnormal communications between the left and right side of the heart, leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and calculation of the [[cardiac output]]. [[Contrast-enhanced ultrasound]] using gas-filled microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related medical measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=MJ|last2=Newton|first2=JD|title=Non-invasive imaging in cardiology for the generalist|journal=British Journal of Hospital Medicine (London, England : 2005)|date=2 July 2017|volume=78|issue=7|pages=392–398|doi=10.12968/hmed.2017.78.7.392|pmid=28692375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Appis|first1=AW|last2=Tracy|first2=MJ|last3=Feinstein|first3=SB|title=Update on the safety and efficacy of commercial ultrasound contrast agents in cardiac applications|journal=Echo Research and Practice|date=1 June 2015|volume=2|issue=2|pages=R55–62|doi=10.1530/ERP-15-0018|pmid=26693339|pmc=4676450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although "Doppler" has become synonymous with "velocity measurement" in medical imaging, in many cases it is not the frequency shift (Doppler shift) of the received signal that is measured, but the phase shift (''when'' the received signal arrives).&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrescu|first=Florian Ion T|year=2015|title=Improving Medical Imaging and Blood Flow Measurement by using a New Doppler Effect Relationship|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/cec7b768b14887621e9494261e122a4c/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1226369|journal=American Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences|volume=8.4|pages=582–588|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Velocity measurements of blood flow are also used in other fields of [[medical ultrasonography]], such as [[obstetric ultrasonography]] and [[neurology]]. Velocity measurement of blood flow in arteries and veins based on Doppler effect is an effective tool for diagnosis of vascular problems like [[stenosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D. H. |last=Evans |first2=W. N. |last2=McDicken |title=Doppler Ultrasound |edition=2nd |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |date=2000 |isbn=978-0-471-97001-9 }}{{page needed|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flow measurement===
Instruments such as the [[laser Doppler velocimetry|laser Doppler velocimeter]] (LDV), and [[acoustic Doppler velocimetry|acoustic Doppler velocimeter]] (ADV) have been developed to measure [[velocity|velocities]] in a fluid flow. The LDV emits a light beam and the ADV emits an ultrasonic acoustic burst, and measure the Doppler shift in wavelengths of reflections from particles moving with the flow. The actual flow is computed as a function of the water velocity and phase. This technique allows non-intrusive flow measurements, at high precision and high frequency.

===Velocity profile measurement===
Developed originally for velocity measurements in medical applications (blood flow), Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimetry (UDV) can measure in real time complete velocity profile in almost any liquids containing particles in suspension such as dust, gas bubbles, emulsions. Flows can be pulsating, oscillating, laminar or turbulent, stationary or transient. This technique is fully non-invasive.

===Satellite communication===
Fast moving satellites can have a Doppler shift of dozens of kilohertz relative to a ground station. The speed, thus magnitude of Doppler effect, changes due to earth curvature. Dynamic Doppler compensation, where the frequency of a signal is changed progressively during transmission, is used so the satellite receives a constant frequency signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Qingchong |first=Liu |title=Doppler measurement and compensation in mobile satellite communications systems |journal=Military Communications Conference Proceedings / MILCOM |volume=1 |date=1999 |pages=316–320 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=822695 |doi=10.1109/milcom.1999.822695|isbn=978-0-7803-5538-5 |citeseerx=10.1.1.674.3987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio===
The [[Leslie speaker]], most commonly associated with and predominantly used with the famous [[Hammond organ]], takes advantage of the Doppler effect by using an electric motor to rotate an acoustic horn around a loudspeaker, sending its sound in a circle. This results at the listener's ear in rapidly fluctuating frequencies of a keyboard note.

===Vibration measurement===
A [[laser Doppler vibrometer]] (LDV) is a non-contact instrument for measuring vibration. The laser beam from the LDV is directed at the surface of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface.

===Developmental biology===
During the [[Segmentation (biology)|segmentation]] of [[vertebrate]] [[embryo]]s, waves of [[gene expression]] sweep across the presomitic [[mesoderm]], the tissue from which the precursors of the [[vertebra]]e ([[somite]]s) are formed. A new somite is formed upon arrival of a wave at the [[Anatomical terms of location|anterior]] end of the presomitic mesoderm. In [[zebrafish]], it has been shown that the shortening of the presomitic mesoderm during segmentation leads to a Doppler effect as the anterior end of the tissue moves into the waves. This Doppler effect contributes to the period of segmentation.&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soroldoni |first1=D. |last2=Jörg |first2=D. J. |last3=Morelli |first3=L.

==Inverse Doppler effect==
Since 1968 scientists such as [[Victor Veselago]] have speculated about the possibility of an inverse Doppler effect. The size of the doppler shift depends on the refractive index of the medium a wave is traveling through. But some materials are capable of [[negative refraction]], which should lead to a Doppler shift that works in a direction opposite that of a conventional Doppler shift.&lt;ref&gt;https://physicsworld.com/a/doppler-shift-is-seen-in-reverse/&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment that claimed to have detected this effect was conducted by Nigel Seddon and Trevor Bearpark in [[Bristol]], [[United Kingdom]] in 2003.&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kozyrev |first1=Alexander B. |last2=van der Weide |first2=Daniel W. |title=Explanation of the Inverse Doppler Effect Observed in Nonlinear Transmission Lines |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=94 |issue=20 |pages=203902 |year=2005 |pmid=16090248 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.203902 |bibcode=2005PhRvL..94t3902K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows''' is a [[montane grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]] of [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Nepal]], which lies between the [[tree line]] and [[snow line]] in the eastern portion of the [[Himalaya]] Range.

==Setting==
The Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows covers an area of {{convert|121300|sqkm|mi2}}, extending along the north and south faces of the Himalaya Range from the [[Kali Gandaki Gorge]] in central Nepal eastwards through [[Tibet]] and India's [[Sikkim]] state, [[Bhutan]], India's [[Arunachal Pradesh]] state, and northernmost [[Myanmar]].

The alpine shrub and meadows lie between approximately {{convert|4000|and|5500|m|ft}} elevation. Permanent ice and snow lies above {{convert|5500|m|ft}}. The [[Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]] lie below {{convert|3000|m|ft}} along the southern slopes of the range, from Central Nepal to Bhutan. The [[Northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]] lie south of the range in Arunachal Pradesh, extending north of the range into the lower valley of the [[Brahmaputra River]] and its tributaries. The [[Northern Triangle temperate forests]] lie to the south of the alpine shrub and meadows in northern Myanmar, and the [[Nujiang Langcang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests]] lie to the east in the gorges of the upper [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] and [[Salween River|Salween]] rivers.

The [[Yarlung Tsangpo arid steppe]] lies in the upper Brahmaputra Valley of Tibet, north of the Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows.

Alpine shrublands, characterized by [[rhododendron]]s, predominate at lower elevations, close to the treeline. The rhododendron flora of the ecoregion is quite varied, with species composition changing as one moves from west to east along the range.

Above the shrublands are alpine meadows which support a variety of herbaceous plants, including species of ''[[Alchemilla]], [[Androsace]], [[Anemone]], [[Diapensia]], [[Draba]], [[Gentiana]], [[Impatiens]], [[Leontopodium]], [[Meconopsis]], [[Pedicularis]], [[Potentilla]], [[Primula]], [[Rhododendron]], [[Saussurea]], [[Saxifraga]], [[Sedum]]'', and ''[[Viola (plant)|Viola]]''. In the spring and summer, the alpine meadows are covered with brightly colored flowers.

On the upper slopes, low grasses and cushion plants grow among the boulders and scree.

==Fauna==
Large mammals include the [[snow leopard]] (''Uncia uncia''), [[bharal]] or Himalayan blue sheep (''Pseudois nayaur''), [[Himalayan tahr]] (''Hemitragus jemlahicus''), [[takin]] (''Budorcas taxicolor''), [[Himalayan musk deer]] (''Moschus chrysogaster''), [[Himalayan goral]] (''Nemorhaedus baileyi''), and [[Himalayan serow]] (''Capricornis thar''). Smaller mammals include [[Himalayan marmot]]s (''Marmota himalayana''), weasels, and pikas.

==Conservation==
Several protected areas lie within or partly within the ecoregion, including:

* [[Valley of Flowers National Park]], India
* [[Annapurna Conservation Area]], Nepal
* [[Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary]], Bhutan
* [[Dihang-Dibang Biosphere Reserve]], India
* [[Dongjiu Nature Reserve]], China
* [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park]], Bhutan
* [[Jigme Dorji National Park]], Bhutan
* [[Langtang National Park]], Nepal
* [[Makalu-Barun National Park and Conservation Area]], Nepal

[[Electric car]]s can have several environmental benefits over conventional internal combustion engine automobiles, such as

However, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the [[emission intensity]] of the power sources used to charge the vehicle, the efficiency of the said vehicle and the energy wasted in the charging process.

Furthermore, the [[Environmental aspects of the electric car#Environmental impact of manufacturing|carbon dioxide emitted for the manufacturing]] should be taken into account.

Electric cars also have disadvantages, such as:
* Heavy reliance of rare-earth elements such as [[neodymium]], [[lanthanum]], [[terbium]], and [[dysprosium]], and other critical metals such as [[lithium]] and [[cobalt]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://setis.ec.europa.eu/setis-reports/setis-magazine/materials-energy/electric-vehicles-and-critical-metals-jamie-speirs Electric vehicles and critical metals - Jamie Speirs, Imperial College Centre for Energy Policy and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mining.com/rare-earth-metals-and-hybrid-cars/ Rare Earth Metals and Hybrid Cars]&lt;/ref&gt; though the quantity of rare metals used differs per car. Reliance on rare earth elements is problematic as these resources are finite.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rare-earth-metals-upgrade-recycle-ethical-china Rare earth metals: tech manufacturers must think again, and so must users]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Possible increased [[Particulates|particulate matter]] emissions from tyres. This is sometimes caused by the fact that most electric cars have a heavy battery, which means the car's tyres are subjected to more wear. The brake pads, however, can be used less frequently than in non-electric cars, if regenerative braking is available and may thus sometimes produce less particulate pollution than brakes in non-electric cars&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/04/fewer-cars-not-electric-cars-beat-air-pollution-says-top-uk-adviser-prof-frank-kelly Electric cars are not the answer to air pollution, says top UK adviser]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2017/03/particle-pollution-from-electric-cars-could-be-worse-than-from-diesel-ones/ Particle pollution from electric cars could be worse than from diesel ones]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some electric cars may have a combination of drum brakes and disc brakes, and drum brakes are known to cause less particulate emissions than disc brakes.

==Electricity generation for electric cars==
[[File:EarthRangersCentre6.jpg|thumb|A solar energy charging station in North America]]

Electric cars usually also show significantly reduced [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, depending on the method used for electricity generation to charge the batteries.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=Daniel |first2=Deborah |last2=Gordon |title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year=2009| pages=22–26 |publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs&gt;{{cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|editor=[[David B.

Even when the power is generated using fossil fuels, electric vehicles usually, compared to gasoline vehicles, show significant reductions in overall well-wheel global carbon emissions due to the highly carbon-intensive production in mining, pumping, refining, transportation and the efficiencies obtained with gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/10001_well_to_wheels_gge_petroleum_use.pdf |title=Well-to-Wheels Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Petroleum Use for Mid-Size Light-Duty Vehicles |publisher=Department Of Energy United States of America |date=2010-10-25 |accessdate=2013-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423230912/http://hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/10001_well_to_wheels_gge_petroleum_use.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in Germany have claimed that while there is some technical superiority of electric propulsion compared with conventional technology that in many countries the effect of electrification of vehicles' fleet emissions will predominantly be due to regulation rather than technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Massiani|first1=Jerome|last2=Weinmann|first2=Jens|title=Estimating electric car's emissions in Germany: an analysis through a pivotal marginal method and comparison with other methods|journal=ECONOMICS AND POLICY OF ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT|date=2012|volume=2|pages=131–155|ref=Massiani and Weinmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, electricity production is submitted to emission quotas, while vehicles' fuel propulsion is not, thus electrification shifts demand from a non-capped sector to a capped sector. This means that the emissions of electrical grids can be expected to improve over time as more wind and solar generation is deployed.

Many countries are introducing {{CO2|link=yes}} average emissions targets across all cars sold by a manufacturer, with financial penalties on manufacturers that fail to meet these targets. This has created an incentive for manufacturers, especially those selling many heavy or high-performance cars, to introduce electric cars as a means of reducing average fleet {{CO2}} emissions.&lt;ref name=telegraph-20140429&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/10795707/Why-electric-cars-must-catch-on.html |title=Why electric cars must catch on |author=Andrew English |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=2014-04-29 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air pollution and carbon emissions in various countries==
{{See also|plug-in electric vehicle#air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions|l1=greenhouse gas emissions in plug-in electric vehicles|plug-in hybrid#greenhouse gas emissions|l2=greenhouse gas emissions in plug-in hybrids}}
Electric cars have several benefits over conventional internal combustion engine automobiles, including a significant reduction of local [[air pollution]], especially in cities, as they do not emit harmful [[motor vehicle emissions|tailpipe pollutants]] such as [[particulate]]s ([[soot]]), [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[carbon monoxide]], [[ozone]], [[lead]], and various [[NOx|oxides of nitrogen]].&lt;ref name="Earth2tech.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Electroauto.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raut"/&gt; The clean air benefit may only be local because, depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions may be shifted to the location of the [[electricity generation|generation plants]].&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt; This is referred to as [[the long tailpipe]] of electric vehicles. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the [[emission intensity]] of the power sources used to charge the vehicle, the efficiency of the said vehicle and the energy wasted in the charging process. For [[mains electricity]] the emission intensity varies significantly per country and within a particular country, and on the demand, the availability of renewable sources and the efficiency of the fossil fuel-based generation used at a given time.&lt;ref name="CO2 Intensity"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buekers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

Charging a vehicle using renewable energy (e.g., [[wind power]] or [[solar panel]]s) yields very low carbon footprint-only that to produce and install the generation system (see [[Energy Returned On Energy Invested]].) Even on a fossil-fueled grid, it's quite feasible for a household with a solar panel to produce enough energy to account for their electric car usage, thus (on average) cancelling out the emissions of charging the vehicle, whether or not the panel directly charges it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plugincars.com/combining-solar-panels-electric-car-130161.html&lt;/ref&gt; Even when using exclusively grid electricity, introducing EVs comes with a major environmental benefits in most (EU) countries, except those relying on old coal fired power plants.&lt;ref name="Buekers"/&gt; So for example the part of electricity, which is produced with renewable energy is (2014) in [[Renewable energy in Norway|Norway 99 percent]] and in [[Renewable energy in Germany|Germany 30 percent]].

===United States===
[[File:Electricity Generation Sources for the United States.svg|thumb|Net electricity generation by energy source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EIA - Electricity Data|url=http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/|website=www.eia.gov|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coal is no longer the predominate source of electricity in the U.S. &amp;nbsp; Chart does not take into account roof top solar.]]

The following table compares tailpipe and upstream {{CO2}} emissions estimated by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] for all series production model year 2014 all-electric passenger vehicles available in the U.S. market. Since all-electric cars do not produce tailpipe emissions, for comparison purposes the two most fuel efficient plug-in hybrids and the typical gasoline-powered car are included in the table. Total emissions include the emissions associated with the production and distribution of electricity used to charge the vehicle, and for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, it also includes emissions associated with tailpipe emissions produced from the [[internal combustion engine]]. These figures were published by the EPA in October in its 2014 report "''Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends''."&lt;ref name=EPAtrends2014/&gt;

To account for the upstream {{CO2}} emissions associated with the production and distribution of electricity, and since electricity production in the United States varies significantly from region to region, the EPA considered three scenarios/ranges with the low end scenario corresponding to the California powerplant emissions factor, the middle of the range represented by the national average powerplant emissions factor, and the upper end of the range corresponding to the powerplant emissions factor for the Rocky Mountains. The EPA estimates that the electricity GHG emission factors for various regions of the country vary from 346&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}/[[kWh]] in California to 986&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}/kWh in the Rockies, with a national average of 648&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}/kWh.&lt;ref name=EPAtrends2014/&gt; In the case of plug-in hybrids, and since their [[all-electric range]] depends on the size of the battery pack, the analysis introduced a utility factor as a projection of the share of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver.&lt;ref name=EPAtrends2014/&gt;

The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS) published in 2012, a report with an assessment of average greenhouse gas emissions resulting from charging plug-in car batteries considering the full life-cycle ([[well-to-wheel]] analysis) and the fuel used to generate electric power by region in the U.S. The study used the [[Nissan Leaf]] all-electric car to establish the analysis's baseline. The UCS study expressed the results in terms of miles per gallon instead of the conventional unit of grams of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|carbon dioxide]] emissions per year. The study found that in areas where electricity is generated from natural gas, nuclear, or renewable resources such as hydroelectric, the potential of plug-in electric cars to reduce greenhouse emissions is significant. On the other hand, in regions where a high proportion of power is generated from coal, [[hybrid electric car]]s produce less {{CO2}} emissions than [[plug-in electric car]]s, and the best fuel efficient gasoline-powered [[subcompact car]] produces slightly less emissions than a plug-in car. In the worst-case scenario, the study estimated that for a region where all energy is generated from coal, a plug-in electric car would emit greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to a gasoline car rated at a combined city/highway fuel economy of {{Convert|30|mpgUS|abbr=on}}. In contrast, in a region that is completely reliant on natural gas, the plug-in would be equivalent to a gasoline-powered car rated at {{Convert|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}} combined.&lt;ref name=UCS2012EVs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-report.pdf|title=State of Charge: Electric Vehicles’ Global Warming Emissions and Fuel-Cost Savings across the United States|author1=Don Anair |author2=Amine Mahmassani |publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]]|date=April 2012|accessdate=2012-08-08}} ''pp. 5, 11, 16–20''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTCO201&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/automobiles/how-green-are-electric-cars-depends-on-where-you-plug-in.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1&amp;pagewanted=all|title=How Green Are Electric Cars? Depends on Where You Plug In|author=Paul Stenquist|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-04-13|accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study found that for 45% of the U.S. population, a plug-in electric car will generate lower {{CO2}} emissions than a gasoline-powered car capable of a combined fuel economy of {{Convert|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, such as the [[Toyota Prius (XW30)|Toyota Prius]]. Cities in this group included [[Portland, Oregon]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], and [[Salt Lake City]], and the cleanest cities achieved well-to-wheel emissions equivalent to a fuel economy of {{Convert|79|mpgUS|abbr=on}}. The study also found that for 37% of the population, the electric car emissions will fall in the range of a gasoline-powered car rated at a combined fuel economy between {{Convert|41|to|50|mpgUS|abbr=on}}, such as the [[Honda Civic Hybrid#Third generation (2011- )|Honda Civic Hybrid]] and the [[Lexus CT200h]].

In September 2014, the UCS published an updated analysis of its 2012 report. The 2014 analysis found that 60% of Americans, up from 45% in 2009, live in regions where an all-electric car produce fewer {{CO2}} equivalent emissions per mile than the most efficient hybrid. The UCS study found two reasons for the improvement. First, electric utilities have adopted cleaner sources of electricity to their mix between the two analysis. Second, electric vehicles have become more efficient, as the average 2013 all-electric vehicle used {{convert|0.33|/mi|/km|abbr=out|2|disp=preunit|kWh |kWh}}, representing a 5% improvement over 2011 models. Also, some new models are cleaner than the average, such as the [[BMW i3]], which is rated at 0.27 kWh by the EPA. In states with a cleaner mix generation, the gains were larger. The average all-electric car in California went up to {{Convert|95|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} equivalent from {{Convert|78|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} in the 2012 study. States with dirtier generation that rely heavily on coal still lag, such as Colorado, where the average BEV only achieves the same emissions as a {{Convert|34|mpgUS|abbr=on}} gasoline-powered car. The author of the 2014 analysis noted that the benefits are not distributed evenly across the U.S. because electric car adoptions is concentrated in the states with cleaner power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/automobiles/coal-fades-so-electrics-get-cleaner.html|title=Coal Fades, So Electrics Get Cleaner|author=Paul Stenquist|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2014-09-19|accessdate=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ucsusa.org/how-do-electric-cars-compare-with-gas-cars-656?_ga=1.204480851.2146914018.1410916275|title=How do EVs Compare with Gas-Powered Vehicles?

Improving on the UCS analysis and several others, an analysis by economists affiliated with the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER), published in November 2014, estimated marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21634544-are-zero-emission-vehicles-cleaner-petrol-cars-it-all-depends-zevs-invisible|title=The ZEV’s invisible tailpipe - Are zero-emission vehicles cleaner than petrol cars?

See p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; The marginal analysis, applied to plug-in electric vehicles, found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region and hours of the day. In some regions, such as the Western U.S. and Texas, {{CO2}} emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car. However, in other regions, such as the Upper Midwest, charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4&amp;nbsp;a.m. implies that PEVs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road.

The results show a tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions. This occurs because coal-fired plants, which have higher emission rates, are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand; while natural gas plants, which have relatively low emissions rates, are often brought online to meet peak demand.&lt;ref name=NBER2014/&gt;

In November 2015, the Union of Concerned Scientists published a new report comparing two [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs) with similar gasoline vehicles by examining their global warming emissions over their full life-cycle, [[Life-cycle assessment#Cradle-to-grave|craddle-to-grave]] analysis. The two BEVs modeled, midsize and full-size, are based on the two most popular BEV models sold in the United States in 2015, the Nissan LEAF and the [[Tesla Model S]]. The study found that all-electric cars representative of those sold today, on average produce less than half the global warming emissions of comparable gasoline-powered vehicles, despite higher emissions of manufacture. Considering the regions where the two most popular electric cars are being sold, excess manufacturing emissions are offset within 6 to 16 months of average driving. The study also concluded that driving an average EV results in lower global warming emissions than driving a gasoline car that gets {{Convert|50|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} in regions covering two-thirds of the U.S. population, up from 45% in 2009. Based on where EVs are sold in the U.S. in 2015, the average EV produces global warming emissions equal to a gasoline vehicle with a {{Convert|68|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on}} fuel economy rating. The authors identified two main reasons for this reduction since the 2012 study. Electricity generation has become cleaner, as coal-fired generation has declined while lower-carbon alternatives have increased. In addition, electric cars are becoming more efficient. For example, the Nissan Leaf and the [[Chevrolet Volt]], have undergone efficiency improvements to the original 2010 models, and other, more efficient BEV models, such as the most lightweight and efficient [[BMW i3]], have entered the market.&lt;ref name="UCS2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf|title=Cleaner Cars from Cradle to Grave: How Electric Cars Beat Gasoline Cars on Lifetime Global Warming Emissions|publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS)|last1= Nealer |first1=Rachael |last2=Reichmuth |first2=David |last3=Anair |first3=Don|date=November 2015|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/11/17/ucs-evs-cleaner-than-gas-cars/|title=UCS: Well-to-wheel, EVs cleaner than pretty much all gas cars|author=Sebastian Blanco |work=Autoblog (website)|date=2015-11-17|accessdate=2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
A study made in the [[UK]] in 2008, concluded that electric vehicles had the potential to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions by at least 40%, even taking into account the emissions due to current electricity generation in the UK and emissions relating to the production and disposal of electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file48653.pdf |title=Investigation into the Scope for the Transport Sector to Switch to Electric Vehicles and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles |publisher=Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform: Department for Transport, UK |date=October 2008 |accessdate=2011-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304043425/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file48653.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The savings are questionable relative to hybrid or diesel cars. (According to official British government testing, the most efficient European market cars are well below 115&amp;nbsp;grams of {{CO2}} per kilometer driven, although a study in Scotland gave 149.5&amp;nbsp;g{{CO2}}/km as the average for new cars in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news193501752.html |title=Electric vehicles given thumbs up|publisher=Physorg |date=2010-05-19 |accessdate=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;) But because UK consumers can select their energy suppliers, it also depends on how 'green' their chosen supplier is in providing energy into the grid. Unlike other countries, in the UK a stable proportion of the electricity is produced by nuclear, coal and gas plants. Therefore, there are only minor differences in the environmental impact over the year.&lt;ref name="Buekers"/&gt;

===Germany===
In a worst-case scenario where incremental electricity demand would be met exclusively with coal, a 2009 study conducted by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and IZES found that a mid-size EV would emit roughly {{convert|200|gCO2/km|abbr=on}}, compared with an average of {{convert|170|gCO2/km|abbr=on}} for a gasoline-powered compact car.&lt;ref name="Palm010509"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10231102-54.html |accessdate=2009-05-04|date=2009-05-01 |title=Study: Electric cars not as green as you think |last=Palm|first=Erik |publisher=CNET Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study concluded that introducing 1&amp;nbsp;million EV cars to Germany would, in the best-case scenario, only reduce {{CO2}} emissions by 0.1%, if nothing is done to upgrade the electricity infrastructure or manage demand.&lt;ref name="Palm010509"/&gt; A more reasonable estimate, relaxing the coal assumption, was provided by Massiani and Weinmann taking into account that the source of energy used for electricity generation would be determined based on the temporal pattern of the additional electricity demand (in other words an increase in electricity consumption at peak hour will activate the marginal technology, while an off peak increase would typically activate other technologies). Their conclusion is that natural gas will provide most of the energy used to reload EV, while renewable energy will not represent more than a few percent of the energy used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Massiani|first1=Jerome|last2=Weinmann|first2=Jens|title=Estimating electric car's emissions in Germany: an analysis through a pivotal marginal method and comparison with other methods|journal=ECONOMICS AND POLICY OF ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT |date=2012|volume=2|pages=131–155|ref=Massiani and Weinmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Volkswagen]] conducted a [[life-cycle assessment]] of its electric vehicles certified by an independent inspection agency. The study found that {{CO2}} emissions during the use phase of its all-electric [[VW e-Golf]] are 99% lower than those of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk7|Golf 1.2 TSI]] when powers comes from exclusively [[hydroelectricity]] generated in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Accounting for the electric car entire life-cycle, the e-Golf reduces emissions by 61%. When the actual [[European Union|EU-27]] electricity mix is considered, the e-Golf emissions are still 26% lower than those of the conventional Golf 1.2 TSI.&lt;ref name=VWemobility&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/03/20140313-golf.html|title=Volkswagen: e-mobility and sustainability; Part 1, the e-Golf and Golf GTE |author=Mike Millikin |publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2014-03-13|accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 in Germany, 28 percent of whole electricity was [[Renewable energy in Germany|renewable energy produced in Germany]].

===France and Belgium===
In France and Belgium, which have many nuclear power plants, {{CO2}} emissions from electric car use would be about {{convert|12|/km|/mi|abbr=on|1|disp=preunit|g}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/news/green-motoring/2010-09/renault-ze |title=Renault to sell electric cars for the same price as diesels &amp;#124; Motoring News|publisher=Honest John |date=2010-09-16 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the stable nuclear production, the timing of charging electric cars has almost no impact on their environmental footprint.&lt;ref name="Buekers"/&gt;

A paper published in the [[Journal of Industrial Ecology]] named ''"Comparative environmental life cycle assessment of conventional and electric vehicles"'' begins by stating that it is important to address concerns of problem-shifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x/full |title=Comparative Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Conventional and Electric Vehicles |first1=Troy R. |last1=Hawkins |first2=Bhawna |last2=Singh |first3=Guillaume |last3=Majeau-Bettez |first4=Anders Hammer |last4=Strømman |journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology |date=February 2012 | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=53–64 | doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study highlighted in particular the toxicity of the electric car's manufacturing process compared to conventional [[petrol]]/[[diesel fuel|diesel]] cars. It concludes that the [[global warming]] potential of the process used to make electric cars is twice that of conventional cars. The study also finds that electric cars do not make sense if the electricity they consume is produced predominately by coal-fired [[power plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/05/electric-cars-emissions-bad-environment |title=Are electric cars bad for the environment? |publisher=The Guardian |date=2012-10-05 |accessdate=2013-08-31 |last=Hickman |first=Leo}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study was later corrected by the authors due to overstating the environmental damage of electric vehicles; many of the electric vehicle components had been incorrectly modelled, and the European power grids were cleaner in many respects than the paper had assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12011/full |title=Corrigendum to: Comparative environmental life cycle assessment of conventional and electric vehicles Journal of Industrial Ecology |first1=Troy R. |last1=Hawkins |first2=Bhawna |last2=Singh |first3=Guillaume |last3=Majeau-Bettez |first4=Anders Hammer |last4=Strømman |journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology |doi=10.1111/jiec.12011 |date=2013-01-13 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reports have found that [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, [[plug-in hybrid]]s and all-electric cars generate more carbon emissions during their production than current conventional vehicles.

The initial higher carbon footprint is due mainly to battery production.&lt;ref name="Buekers"/&gt; As an example, the [[Ricardo plc|Ricardo]] study estimated that 43% of production emissions for a [[mid-size car|mid-size]] electric car are from the battery production.&lt;ref name=Ricardo2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/06/lowcvp-20110608.html|title=Ricardo study finds electric and hybrid cars have a higher carbon footprint during production than conventional vehicles, but still offer a lower footprint over the full life cycle|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2011-06-08|accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the Automotive Science Group (ASG) published the result of a study conducted to [[Life-cycle assessment|assess the life-cycle]] of over 1,300 automobiles across nine categories sold in North America. The study found that among advanced automotive technologies, the Nissan Leaf holds the smallest life-cycle environmental footprint of any model year 2014 automobile available in the North American market with at least four-person occupancy. The study concluded that the increased environmental impacts of manufacturing the battery electric technology is more than offset with increased environmental performance during operational life. For the assessment, the study used the average electricity mix of the U.S. grid in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insideevs.com/nissan-leaf-has-smallest-lifecycle-footprint-of-any-2014-automobile-sold-today-in-north-america/|title=Nissan LEAF Has Smallest Lifecycle Footprint of Any 2014 Model Year Automobile Sold in North America|author=Eric Loveday|publisher=Inside EVs|date=2014-02-11|accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automotivescience.com/press/4582462907|title=Life-cycle Assessment of 1,300 Models Reveals Best of 2014|author=Automotive Science Group (ASG)|publisher=ASG Press Room|date=2014-02-04|accessdate=2014-02-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302031302/http://www.automotivescience.com/press/4582462907|archivedate=2014-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a report made by IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute also calculated that the CO2 emissions of lithium-ion batteries (present in many electric cars today) are in the order of 150-200 kilos of carbon dioxide equivalents per kilowatt-hour battery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ivl.se/english/startpage/top-menu/pressroom/press-releases/press-releases---arkiv/2017-06-21-new-report-highlights-climate-footprint-of-electric-car-battery-production.html https://www.ivl.se/english/startpage/top-menu/pressroom/press-releases/press-releases---arkiv/2017-06-21-new-report-highlights-climate-footprint-of-electric-car-battery-production.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the CO2 emissions (50%) comes from [[Lithium-ion battery#Construction|cell manufacturing]], whereas mining and refining contributes only a small part of the CO2 emissions. In practice, emissions in the order of 150-200 kilos of carbon dioxide equivalents per kilowatt-hour means that an electric car with a 100kWh battery will thus have emitted 15-20 tons of carbon dioxide even before the vehicle ignition is turned on. One of the authors, Mats-Ola Larsson, reportedly said that this is the same amount of emissions as driving a gasoline car for 8,2 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://principia-scientific.org/study-tesla-car-battery-production-releases-as-much-co2-as-8-years-of-driving-on-gas/ Study: Tesla car battery production releases as much CO2 as 8 years of driving on gas]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Popular Mechanics calculates that even if the 15-20 tons estimate is correct, it would only take 2.4 years of driving for the electric car with a 100kWh battery to recover the greenhouse emissions from the battery manufacturing. It however does not calculate in the emissions from battery replacements (battery replacement of regular lithium-ion batteries needs to be done every 2–3 years; lithium-ion batteries from cars typically last longer though).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/news/a27039/tesla-battery-emissions-study-fake-news/ That Tesla Battery Emissions Study Making the Rounds?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5531">The '''FIVB Beach Volleyball World Rankings''' is a ranking system for men's and women's national teams in [[beach volleyball]]. The teams of the member nations of [[FIVB]], beach volleyball and [[volleyball]]'s world governing body, are ranked based on their competitions results with the most successful teams being ranked highest.

The rankings are used in international competitions to define the seeded teams and arrange them in pools. Specific procedures for seeding and pooling are established by the FIVB in each competition's formula.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13841">[[Image:Origins of English PieChart.svg|thumb|right|350px|According to one study, the percentage of modern English words derived from each language group are as follows:&lt;br&gt;Latin (including words used only in scientific / medical / legal contexts): ~29%&lt;br&gt;French (Latin): ~29%&lt;br&gt;Germanic: ~26%&lt;br&gt;Others: ~16%]]

The core of [[English language]] descends from Old English, the language brought with the Angles, Saxon, and Jutish settlers to what was to be called England in and after the 500s. The bulk of the language in spoken and written texts is from this source. As a statistical rule, around 70 percent of words in any text are Anglo-Saxon. Moreover, the grammar is largely Anglo-Saxon.&lt;ref&gt;Fennell, Barbara 1998. ''A history of English. A sociolinguistic approach''. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant portion of the English vocabulary comes from [[Romance languages|Romance]] and Latinate sources. Estimates of native words (derived from [[Old English language|Old English]]) range from 20%&amp;ndash;33%, with the rest made up of outside borrowings. A portion of these borrowings come directly from [[Latin]], or through one of the Romance languages, particularly [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[French language|French]], but some also from [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; or from other languages (such as [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Frankish|Frankish]] or [[Greek language|Greek]]) into Latin and then into English. The influence of Latin in English, therefore, is primarily lexical in nature, being confined mainly to words derived from Latin roots.&lt;ref&gt;McWhorter, ''Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue'', 2008, pp. 89–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some new words enter English as slang, most do not. Some words are adopted from other languages; some are mixtures of existing words ([[portmanteau]] words), and some are new creations made of roots from [[Extinct language|dead languages]]: e.g., [[thanatopsis]].

==Word origins==
A computerized survey of about 80,000 words in the old ''[[Shorter Oxford Dictionary]]'' (3rd ed.) was published in ''Ordered Profusion'' by Thomas Finkenstaedt and Dieter Wolff (1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finkenstaedt |first=Thomas |author2=Dieter Wolff  |title=Ordered profusion; studies in dictionaries and the English lexicon |publisher=C. Winter |year=1973 |isbn=3-533-02253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that estimated the origin of English words as follows:

* French: [[List of English words of French origin|28.3%]]
* Latin, including modern scientific and technical Latin: [[List of Latin words with English derivatives|28.24%]]
* [[Germanic languages]] – inherited from [[Old English]], from Proto-Germanic, or a more recent borrowing from a Germanic language such as [[Old Norse]]; does not include [[List of English Latinates of Germanic origin|Germanic words borrowed from a Romance language]], i.e., coming from the Germanic element in French, Latin or other Romance languages: 25%
* Greek: 5.32%
* No etymology given: 4.04%
* Derived from proper names: 3.28%
* All other languages: less than 1%

A survey by [[Joseph M. Williams]] in ''Origins of the English Language'' of 10,000 words taken from several thousand business letters gave this set of statistics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0029344700 |title=Joseph M. Willams, Origins of the English Language at |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* French (langue d'oïl): 41%
* "Native" English: 33%
* Latin: 15%
* Old Norse: 5%
* Dutch: 1%
* Other: 5%&lt;ref&gt;[[English language#Word origins|Origins]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages influencing the English language==
{{Expand section|date=May 2017}}
Here is a list of the most common foreign language influences in English, where other languages have influenced or contributed words to English.

===[[Celtic languages|Celtic]]===
{{Main|Lists of English words of Celtic origin}}
Words are almost absent, except for dialectal words, such as the [[Yan Tan Tethera]] system of counting sheep. However, hypotheses have been made that English syntax was influenced by Celtic languages, such as the system of [[Continuous and progressive aspects|continuous tenses]] was a cliché of similar Celtic phrasal structures; this is controversial, as the system has clear native English and other Germanic developments.

===[[French language|French]]===
{{Main|English words of French origin}}
The French contributed legal, military, technological, and political terminology. Their language also contributed common words, such as the names of meats: ''veal'', ''mutton'', ''beef'', ''pork'', and how food was prepared: ''boil'', ''broil'', ''fry'', ''roast'', and ''stew''; as well as words related to the nobility: ''prince'', ''duke'', ''marquess'', ''viscount'', ''baron'', and their feminine equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Algeo|first1=John|title=The Origins and Development of the English Language|date=2010|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=1-4282-3145-5|edition=6th|url=http://www.kaa.ff.ukf.sk/attachments/article/39/The%20Origins%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20English%20Language%20(Textbook).pdf|accessdate=8 June 2017|format=PDF}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|254-258}} Nearly 40 percent of English words (in an 80,000 word dictionary) may be of French origin.

===[[Latin]]===
{{Main|Latin influence in English}}
Scientific and technical words, [[medical terminology]], academic and legal terminology.

===[[Greek language|Greek]]===
{{See also|English words of Greek origin|List of Greek morphemes used in English}}
Scientific and medical terminology (for instance [[wiktionary:-phobia|-phobia]]s and [[wiktionary:-logy|-ologies]]), Christian theological terminology.

===[[Norman language|Norman]]===
''Castle'', ''cauldron'', ''kennel'', ''catch'', ''cater'' are among Norman words introduced into English. The Norman language also introduced (or reinforced) words of Norse origin such as ''mug''.

===[[Dutch language|Dutch]]===
{{See also|List of English words of Dutch origin|List of place names of Dutch origin|Dutch linguistic influence on naval terms|List of English words of Afrikaans origin}}
There are many ways through which Dutch words have entered the English language: via trade and navigation, such as ''[[Penus (boating)|skipper]]'' (from ''schipper''), ''[[freebooter (disambiguation)|freebooter]]'' (from ''vrijbuiter''), ''[[keelhauling]]'' (from ''kielhalen''); via painting, such as ''[[landscape]]'' (from ''landschap''), ''[[easel]]'' (from ''ezel''), ''[[still life]]'' (from ''stilleven''); warfare, such as ''[[forlorn hope]] (from ''verloren hoop''), ''beleaguer (from ''beleger''), ''to bicker'' (from ''bicken''); via civil engineering, such as ''[[dam]]'', ''[[polder]]'', ''[[dune]]'' (from ''duin''); via the [[New Netherland]] settlements in North America, such as  ''[[cookie]]'' (from ''koekie''), ''[[wikt:boss|boss]]'' from ''baas'', ''[[Santa Claus]]'' (from ''[[Sinterklaas]]''); via Dutch/[[Afrikaans]] speakers with English speakers in [[South Africa]], such as ''[[wildebeest]]'', ''[[apartheid]]'', ''[[boer]]''; via French words of Dutch/Flemish origin that have subsequently been adopted into English, such as ''[[boulevard]]'' (from ''bolwerk''), ''[[mannequin]]'' (from ''manneken''), ''[[buoy]]'' (from ''boei'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Joseph M|title=Origins of the English Language|date=1986|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0029344700|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Origins_of_the_English_Language.html?id=RamwAZ6fpaoC|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Spanish language|Spanish]]===
{{See also|List of English words of Spanish origin}}
Words relating to warfare and tactics, for instance ''[[flotilla]]'' and ''[[guerrilla]]''; or related to science and culture, whether created in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], originated in [[Amerindian]] civilizations ([[Cariban languages|Cariban]]: ''[[cannibal]]'', ''hurricane''; [[Mescalero language|Mescalero]]: ''[[apache]]''; [[Nahuatl]]: ''[[tomato]]'', ''[[coyote]]'', ''[[chocolate]]''; [[Quechua language|Quechua]]: ''[[potato]]''; [[Taíno language|Taíno]]: ''[[tobacco]]''), or [[Iberian Romance languages]] (''aficionado'', ''[[albino]]'', ''[[alligator]]'', ''[[cargo]]'', ''[[cigar]]'', ''[[embargo]]'', ''[[guitar]]'', ''[[jade]]'', ''[[mesa]]'', ''[[paella]]'', ''[[platinum]]'', ''[[plaza]]'', ''[[wikt:renegade|renegade]]'', ''[[rodeo]]'', ''[[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]]'', ''savvy'', ''[[wikt:sierra|sierra]]'', ''[[siesta]]'', ''[[tilde]]'', ''[[tornado]]'', ''[[vanilla]]'' etc.).

===[[Italian language|Italian]]===
{{See also|List of English words of Italian origin}}
Words relating to some music, [[piano]], ''fortissimo''. Or Italian culture, such as ''piazza'', ''pizza'', ''gondola'', ''balcony'', ''[[fascism]]''. The English word ''[[umbrella]]'' comes from Italian ''ombrello''.

===[[Languages of India|Indian Languages]]===
{{See also|List of English words of Hindi origin}}
Words relating to culture, originating from the colonial era. Many of these words are of [[Persian language|Persian]] origin rather than [[Hindi]] because Persian was the official language of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] courts. e.g., ''pyjamas'', ''bungalow'', ''verandah'', ''jungle'', ''curry'', ''shampoo'', ''khaki''.

===[[German language|German]]===
{{See also|List of German expressions in English}}
German words relating to [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] found their way into the English language, words such as ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'', ''[[Führer]]'' and ''[[Lebensraum]]''; food terms, such as ''[[bratwurst]]'', ''[[hamburger]]'' and ''[[Sausage|frankfurter]]''; words related to psychology and philosophy, such a ''[[gestalt psychology|gestalt]]'', ''[[Übermensch]]'', ''[[zeitgeist]]'' and ''[[realpolitik]]''. From German origin are also: ''wanderlust'', ''schadenfreude'', ''kaputt'', ''kindergarten'', ''autobahn'', ''rucksack''.

===[[Old Norse]]===
{{See also|List of English words of Old Norse origin}}
Words of [[Old Norse]] origin have entered English primarily from the contact between Old Norse and [[Old English]] during colonisation of eastern and northern [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] between the mid 9th to the 11th centuries (see also [[Danelaw]]). Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as ''egg'', ''sky'' or ''knife''.

===[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]===
Words used in religious contexts, like [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabath]], [[kosher]], [[hallelujah]], [[amen]], and [[jubilee (Biblical)|jubilee]] or words that have become slang like ''[[Schmuck (pejorative)|schmuck]]'', ''shmooze'', ''nosh'', ''[[oy vey]]'', and ''[[wikt:Schmutz|schmutz]]''.

===[[Arabic language|Arabic]]===
{{See also|List of English words of Arabic origin}}
Trade items such as ''borax'', ''coffee'', ''cotton'', ''hashish'', ''henna'', ''mohair'', ''muslin'', ''saffron''; [[Islam]]ic religious terms such as ''jihad'', ''hadith'' and ''sharia''; scientific vocabulary borrowed into Latin in the 12th and 13th centuries (''alcohol'', ''alkali'', ''algebra'', ''azimuth'', ''cipher'', ''nadir''); plants or plant products originating in tropical Asia and introduced to medieval Europe through Arabic intermediation (''camphor'', ''jasmine'', ''lacquer'', ''lemon'', ''orange'', ''sugar''); Middle Eastern cuisine words (''couscous'', ''falafel'', ''hummus'', ''kebab'', ''tahini'').

==Counting==
Cardinal numbering in English follows two models, Germanic and Italic. The basic numbers are zero through ten. The numbers eleven through nineteen follow native Germanic style, as do twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, and ninety.

Standard English, especially in very conservative formal contexts, continued to use native Germanic style as late as World War I for intermediate numbers greater than 20, viz., "one-and-twenty," "five-and-thirty," "seven-and-ninety," and so. But with the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the Latin tradition of counting as "twenty-one," "thirty-five," "ninety-seven," etc., which is easier to say and was already common in non-standard regional dialects, gradually replaced the traditional Germanic style to become the dominant style by the end of nineteenth century.

== Opposition ==
{{main|Linguistic purism in English}}
Linguistic purism in the English language is the belief that words of native origin should be used instead of foreign-derived ones (which are mainly Romantic, Latin and Greek). "Native" can mean "Anglo-Saxon" or it can be widened to include all Germanic words. In its mild form, it merely means using existing native words instead of foreign-derived ones (such as using "begin" instead of "commence"). In its more extreme form, it involves reviving native words that are no longer widely used (such as "ettle" for "intend") and/or coining new words from Germanic roots (such as word stock for vocabulary). This dates at least to the [[inkhorn term]] debate of the 16th and 17th century, where some authors rejected the foreign influence, and has continued to this day, being most prominent in [[Plain English]] advocacy to avoid Latinate terms if a simple native alternative exists.

[[File:Frej Rällinge.jpg|thumb|Believed to depict Freyr, viking age.]]

'''Freyr''' ([[Old Norse]]: Lord), sometimes anglicized as '''Frey''', is a widely attested god associated with [[Sacred king|sacral kingship]], virility and prosperity, with sunshine and fair weather, and pictured as a [[phallus|phallic]] [[fertility god]] in [[Norse mythology]]. Freyr is said to "bestow peace and pleasure on mortals". Freyr, sometimes referred to as [[Yngvi]]-Freyr, was especially associated with [[Sweden]] and seen as an ancestor of the [[Mythological kings of Sweden|Swedish royal house]].

In the [[Iceland]]ic books the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', Freyr is presented as one of the [[Vanir]], the son of the sea god [[Njörðr]], as well as the twin brother of the goddess [[Freyja]]. The gods gave him [[Álfheimr]], the realm of the [[Álfar|Elves]], as a teething present. He rides the shining [[Norse dwarves|dwarf]]-made boar [[Gullinbursti]] and possesses the ship [[Skíðblaðnir]] which always has a favorable breeze and can be folded together and carried in a pouch when it is not being used. He has the servants [[Skírnir]], [[Byggvir]] and [[Beyla]].

The most extensive surviving Freyr [[mythology|myth]] relates Freyr's falling in love with the female [[jötunn]] [[Gerðr]]. Eventually, she becomes his wife but first Freyr has to give away his  [[Sword of Freyr|sword]] which fights on its own "if wise be he who wields it." Although deprived of this weapon, Freyr defeats the jötunn [[Beli (Norse giant)|Beli]] with an [[antler]]. However, lacking his sword, Freyr will be killed by the fire jötunn [[Surtr]] during the events of [[Ragnarök]].

Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Freyr is revived in the modern period in [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]] movement.

==Adam of Bremen==
Written around 1080, one of the oldest written sources on pre-Christian Scandinavian religious practices is [[Adam of Bremen]]'s ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]''. Adam claimed to have access to first-hand accounts on pagan practices in Sweden. He refers to Freyr with the [[Latinized name]] '''Fricco''' and mentions that an [[Cult image|image]] of him at [[Skara]] was destroyed by the Christian missionary, [[Egino (Bishop of Dalby)|Bishop Egino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tschan|2002|p=192}} (Book 4, ix (9))&lt;/ref&gt; His description of the [[Temple at Uppsala]] gives some details on the god.

{|
| style="padding: 1pt 10pt;" |
In hoc templo, quod totum ex auro paratum est, statuas trium deorum veneratur populus, ita ut potentissimus eorum Thor in medio solium habeat triclinio; hinc et inde locum possident Wodan et Fricco. Quorum significationes eiusmodi sunt: 'Thor', inquiunt, 'praesidet in aere, qui tonitrus et fulmina, ventos ymbresque, serena et fruges gubernat. Alter Wodan, id est furor, bella gerit, hominique ministrat virtutem contra inimicos. Tertius est Fricco, pacem voluptatemque largiens mortalibus'. Cuius etiam simulacrum fingunt cum ingenti priapo.
::''Gesta Hammaburgensis'' 26, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050207105412/http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrons/bremen.htm Waitz' edition]
| style="padding: 1pt 10pt;" |
In this temple, entirely decked out in gold, the people worship the statues of three gods in such wise that the mightiest of them, [[Thor]], occupies a throne in the middle of the chamber; [[Woden]] and Frikko have places on either side. The significance of these gods is as follows: Thor, they say, presides over the air, which governs the thunder and lightning, the winds and rains, fair weather and crops. The other, Woden—that is, the Furious—carries on war and imparts to man strength against his enemies. The third is Frikko, who bestows peace and pleasure on mortals. His likeness, too, they fashion with an immense [[phallus]].
::''Gesta Hammaburgensis'' 26, Tschan's translation&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tschan|2002|p=207}} (Book 4, xxvi (26))&lt;/ref&gt;164815
|
|}

Later in the account Adam states that when a marriage is performed a [[libation]] is made to the image of Fricco.

Historians are divided on the reliability of Adam's account.&lt;ref&gt;Haastrup 2004, pp. 18-24.&lt;/ref&gt; While he is close in time to the events he describes he has a clear agenda to emphasize the role of the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen]] in the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]]. His timeframe for the Christianization of Sweden conflicts with other sources, such as [[runes|runic]] inscriptions and archaeological evidence does not confirm the presence of a large temple at Uppsala. On the other hand, the existence of phallic idols was confirmed in 1904 with a find at Rällinge in Södermanland, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;"Rällinge-Frö".&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Prose Edda''==
When [[Snorri Sturluson]] was writing in 13th century Iceland, the indigenous Germanic gods were still remembered although they had not been openly worshiped for more than two centuries.

===''Gylfaginning''===
In the ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' section of his ''[[Prose Edda]]'', Snorri introduces Freyr as one of the major gods.

{|

[[File:Frey had seated himself on the throne of Odin.jpg|thumb|Seated on Odin's throne Hliðskjálf, the god Freyr sits in contemplation in an illustration (1908) by Frederic Lawrence]]
This description has similarities to the older account by Adam of Bremen but the differences are interesting. Adam assigns control of the weather and produce of the fields to Thor but Snorri says that Freyr rules over those areas. Snorri also omits any explicitly sexual references in Freyr's description. Those discrepancies can be explained in several ways. It is possible that the Norse gods did not have exactly the same roles in Icelandic and Swedish paganism but it must also be remembered that Adam and Snorri were writing with different goals in mind. Either Snorri or Adam may also have had distorted information.

The only extended myth related about Freyr in the ''Prose Edda'' is the story of his marriage.

{|

Þat var einn dag er Freyr hafði gengit í Hliðskjálf ok sá of heima alla.

It chanced one day that Freyr had gone to [[Hlidskjálf]], and gazed over all the world; but when he looked over into the northern region, he saw on an estate a house great and fair. And toward this house went a woman; when she raised her hands and opened the door before her, brightness gleamed from her hands, both over sky and sea, and all the worlds were illumined of her.

The woman is [[Gerðr]], a beautiful [[Jötunn|giantess]]. Freyr immediately falls in love with her and becomes depressed and taciturn. After a period of brooding, he consents to talk to [[Skírnir]], his foot-page. He tells Skírnir that he has fallen in love with a beautiful woman and thinks he will die if he cannot have her. He asks Skírnir to go and woo her for him.

{|

Then Skírnir answered thus: he would go on his errand, but Freyr should give him his own sword-which is so good that it fights of itself;- and Freyr did not refuse, but gave him the sword. Then Skírnir went forth and wooed the woman for him, and received her promise; and [[Numbers in Norse mythology|nine nights later]] she was to come to the place called [[Barrey]], and then go to the bridal with Freyr.

The loss of [[Sword of Freyr|Freyr's sword]] has consequences. According to the ''Prose Edda'', Freyr had to fight [[Beli (Norse giant)|Beli]] without his sword and slew him with an [[antler]]. But the result at [[Ragnarök]], the end of the world, will be much more serious. Freyr is fated to fight the fire-giant [[Surtr]] and since he does not have his sword he will be defeated.
[[Image:Freyr and Surtr by Frølich.jpg|right|thumb|The final battle between Freyr and Surtr, illustration by [[Lorenz Frølich]]]]
Even after the loss of his weapon Freyr still has two magical artifacts, both of them [[Norse dwarves|dwarf]]-made. One is the ship [[Skíðblaðnir]], which will have favoring breeze wherever its owner wants to go and can also be folded together like a napkin and carried in a pouch. The other is the boar [[Gullinbursti]] whose mane glows to illuminate the way for his owner. No myths involving Skíðblaðnir have come down to us but Snorri relates that Freyr rode to [[Baldr]]'s funeral in a wagon pulled by Gullinbursti.

===Skaldic poetry===
Freyr is referred to several times in [[skaldic poetry]]. In ''[[Húsdrápa]]'', partially preserved in the Prose Edda, he is said to ride a boar to Baldr's funeral.

In a poem by [[Egill Skalla-Grímsson]], Freyr is called upon along with [[Njörðr]] to drive [[Eric I of Norway|Eric Bloodaxe]] from Norway. The same [[skald]] mentions in ''[[Arinbjarnarkviða]]'' that his friend has been blessed by the two gods.

Freyr is mentioned in several of the poems in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''. The information there is largely consistent with that of the ''Prose Edda'' while each collection has some details not found in the other.

===''Völuspá''===
''[[Völuspá]]'', the best known of the Eddic poems, describes the final confrontation between Freyr and Surtr during Ragnarök.

Some scholars have preferred a slightly different translation, in which the sun shines "from the sword of the gods". The idea is that the sword which Surtr slays Freyr with is the "sword of the gods" which Freyr had earlier bargained away for Gerðr. This would add a further layer of tragedy to the myth. [[Sigurður Nordal]] argued for this view but the possibility represented by [[Ursula Dronke]]'s translation above is equally possible.

===''Grímnismál''===
''[[Grímnismál]]'', a poem which largely consists of miscellaneous information about the gods, mentions Freyr's abode.

|

A [[tooth-gift]] was a gift given to an infant on the cutting of the first tooth. Since ''Alfheimr'' or ''Álfheimr'' means "World of [[Álfar]] (Elves)" the fact that Freyr should own it is one of the indications of a connection between the Vanir and the obscure Álfar. ''Grímnismál'' also mentions that the sons of [[Ívaldi]] made Skíðblaðnir for Freyr and that it is the best of ships.

===''Lokasenna''===
In the poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'', [[Loki]] accuses the gods of various misdeeds. He criticizes the Vanir for [[incest]], saying that [[Njörðr]] had Freyr with [[Sister-wife of Njörðr|his sister]]. He also states that the gods discovered Freyr and Freyja having sex together. The god [[Týr]] speaks up in Freyr's defense.

[[Image:The Lovesickness of Frey.jpg|thumb|"The Lovesickness of Frey" (1908) by W. G. Collingwood.]]
The courtship of Freyr and Gerðr is dealt with extensively in the poem ''[[Skírnismál]]''.
Freyr is depressed after seeing Gerðr. Njörðr and [[Skaði]] ask Skírnir to go and talk with him. Freyr reveals the cause of his grief and asks Skírnir to go to [[Jötunheimr]] to woo Gerðr for him. Freyr gives Skírnir a steed and his [[Sword of Freyr|magical sword]] for the journey.

[[Image:In Freyers Tempel bei Upsala by F. W. Heine.jpg|thumb|"In Freyr's Temple near Uppsala" (1882) by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Heine]].]]
[[Snorri Sturluson]] starts his epic history of the kings of Norway with ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', a euhemerized account of the Norse gods. Here Odin and the Æsir are men from Asia who gain power through their prowess in war and Odin's skills. But when Odin attacks the Vanir he bites off more than he can chew and peace is negotiated after the destructive and indecisive [[Æsir-Vanir War]]. Hostages are exchanged to seal the peace deal and the Vanir send Freyr and Njörðr to live with the Æsir. At this point the saga, like ''Lokasenna'', mentions that incest was practised among the Vanir.

Odin makes Njörðr and Freyr priests of sacrifices and they become influential leaders. Odin goes on to conquer the North and settles in Sweden where he rules as king, collects taxes and maintains sacrifices. After Odin's death, Njörðr takes the throne. During his rule there is peace and good harvest and the Swedes come to believe that Njörðr controls these things. Eventually Njörðr falls ill and dies.

Frey took the kingdom after Njord, and was called ''drot'' by the Swedes, and they paid taxes to him. He was, like his father, fortunate in friends and in good seasons. Frey built a great temple at Upsal, made it his chief seat, and gave it all his taxes, his land, and goods.  Then began the [[Uppsala öd|Upsal domains]], which have remained ever since. Then began in his days the [[Frode]]-peace; and then there were good seasons, in all the land, which the Swedes ascribed to Frey, so that he was more worshipped than the other gods, as the people became much richer in his days by reason of the peace and good seasons. His wife was called Gerd, daughter of [[Gymir|Gymis]], and their son was called [[Fjölnir|Fjolne]]. Frey was called by another name, [[Yngvi|Yngve]]; and this name Yngve was considered long after in his race as a name of honour, so that his descendants have since been called [[Yngling]]er. Frey fell into a sickness; and as his illness took the upper hand, his men took the plan of letting few approach him. In the meantime they raised a great [[tumulus|mound]], in which they placed a door with three holes in it. Now when Frey died they bore him secretly into the mound, but told the Swedes he was alive; and they kept watch over him for three years. They brought all the taxes into the mound, and through the one hole they put in the gold, through the other the silver, and through the third the copper money that was paid. Peace and good seasons continued. ''Ynglinga saga'' 12, [https://web.archive.org/web/20051211092306/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/OMACL/Heimskringla/ynglinga.html Laing's translation]

When it became known to the Swedes that Frey was dead, and yet peace and good seasons continued, they believed that it must be so as long as Frey remained in Sweden; and therefore they would not burn his remains, but called him the god of this world, and afterwards offered continually [[blót|blood-sacrifices]] to him, principally for peace and good seasons.

Freyr had a son named [[Fjölnir]], who succeeds him as king and rules during the continuing period of peace and good seasons. Fjölnir's descendants are enumerated in ''[[Ynglingatal]]'' which describes the [[mythological kings of Sweden]].

==''Ögmundar þáttr dytts''==
The 14th century Icelandic ''[[Ögmundar þáttr dytts]]'' contains a tradition of how Freyr was transported in a wagon and administered by a priestess, in [[Sweden]]. Freyr's role as a fertility god needed a female counterpart in a divine couple (McKinnell's translation 1987&lt;ref&gt;[http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~alvismal/3search.pdf Heinrichs, Anne: ''The Search for Identity: A Problem after the Conversion'', in ''alvíssmál 3''. pp.54-55.]&lt;/ref&gt;):

{{quote|Great heathen sacrifices were held there at that time, and for a long while Frey had been the god who was worshipped most there — and so much power had been gained by Frey’s statue that the devil used to speak to people out of the mouth of the idol, and a young and beautiful woman had been obtained to serve Frey. It was the faith of the local people that Frey was alive, as seemed to some extent to be the case, and they thought he would need to have a sexual relationship with his wife; along with Frey she was to have complete control over the temple settlement and all that belonged to it.}}

In this short story, a man named Gunnar was suspected of manslaughter and escaped to Sweden, where Gunnar became acquainted with this young priestess. He helped her drive Freyr's wagon with the god effigy in it, but the god did not appreciate Gunnar and so attacked him and would have killed Gunnar if he had not promised himself to return to the Christian faith if he would make it back to Norway. When Gunnar had promised this, a demon jumped out of the god effigy and so Freyr was nothing but a piece of wood. Gunnar destroyed the wooden idol and dressed himself as Freyr, then Gunnar and the priestess travelled across Sweden where people were happy to see the god visiting them. After a while he made the priestess pregnant, but this was seen by the Swedes as confirmation that Freyr was truly a fertility god and not a scam. Finally, Gunnar had to flee back to Norway with his young bride and had her baptized at the court of [[Olaf Tryggvason]].

==Other Icelandic sources==
Worship of Freyr is alluded to in several [[Icelanders' sagas]].

The protagonist of ''[[Hrafnkels saga]]'' is a [[goði|priest]] of Freyr. He dedicates a horse to the god and kills a man for riding it, setting in motion a chain of fateful events.

In ''[[Gísla saga]]'' a chieftain named Þorgrímr Freysgoði is an ardent worshipper of Freyr. When he dies he is buried in a [[Tumulus|howe]].

''Varð og sá hlutur einn er nýnæmum þótti gegna að aldrei festi snæ utan og sunnan á haugi Þorgríms og eigi fraus; og gátu menn þess til að hann myndi Frey svo ávarður fyrir blótin að hann myndi eigi vilja að freri á milli þeirra.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://snerpa.is/net/isl/gisl.htm Gísla saga Súrssonar&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

And now, too, a thing happened which seemed strange and new. No snow lodged on the south side of Thorgrim's howe, nor did it freeze there. And men guessed it was because Thorgrim had been so dear to Frey for his worship's sake that the god would not suffer the frost to come between them. -&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://northvegr.org/lore/gisli/015.php# |title=Northvegr - The Story Of Gisli The Outlaw&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt; |access-date=3 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605035403/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/gisli/015.php# |archive-date=5 June 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hallfreðar saga]]'', ''[[Víga-Glúms saga]]'' and ''[[Vatnsdœla saga]]'' also mention Freyr.

Other Icelandic sources referring to Freyr include ''[[Íslendingabók]]'', ''[[Landnámabók]]'', and ''[[Hervarar saga]]''.

''[[Íslendingabók]]'', written around 1125, is the oldest Icelandic source to mention Freyr, including him in a genealogy of Swedish kings. ''[[Landnámabók]]'' includes a heathen oath to be sworn at an assembly where Freyr, Njörðr, and "[[almáttki áss|the almighty ''áss'']]" are invoked. ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' mentions a [[Yule]]tide sacrifice of a boar to Freyr.

==''Gesta Danorum''==
The 12th Century Danish ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' describes Freyr, under the name '''Frø''', as the "viceroy of the gods".

{|
| style="padding: 1pt 10pt;" |
Frø quoque deorum satrapa sedem haud procul Upsala cepit, ubi veterem litationis morem tot gentibus ac saeculis usurpatum tristi infandoque piaculo mutavit. Siquidem humani generis hostias mactare aggressus foeda superis libamenta persolvit. ''Gesta Danorum'' 3,  [http://www.kb.dk/elib/lit/dan/saxo/lat/or.dsr/3/2/index.htm Olrik's edition]
| style="padding: 1pt 10pt;" |
There was also a viceroy of the gods, Frø, who took up residence not far from Uppsala and altered the ancient system of sacrifice practised for centuries among many peoples to a morbid and unspeakable form of expiation. He delivered abominable offerings to the powers above by instituting the slaughter of human victims. ''Gesta Danorum'' 3, Fisher's translation
|
|}

That Freyr had a [[Cult (religion)|cult]] at Uppsala is well confirmed from other sources. The reference to the change in sacrificial ritual may also reflect some historical memory. There is archaeological evidence for an increase in [[human sacrifice]]s in the late [[Viking Age]]&lt;ref&gt;Davidson 1999, Vol. II, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; though among the Norse gods human sacrifice is most often linked to Odin. Another reference to Frø and sacrifices is found earlier in the work, where the beginning of an annual ''[[blót]]'' to him is related. King [[Hadingus]] is cursed after killing a divine being and atones for his crime with a sacrifice.

{|
|
Siquidem propitiandorum numinum gratia Frø deo rem divinam furvis hostiis fecit. Quem litationis morem annuo feriarum circuitu repetitum posteris imitandum reliquit. Frøblot Sueones vocant. ''Gesta Danorum'' 1, [http://www.kb.dk/elib/lit/dan/saxo/lat/or.dsr/1/8/index.htm Olrik's edition]
|
[I]n order to mollify the divinities he did indeed make a holy sacrifice of dark-coloured victims to the god Frø. He repeated this mode of propitiation at an annual festival and left it to be imitated by his descendants. The Swedes call it Frøblot. ''Gesta Danorum'' 1, Fisher's translation
|
|}

The sacrifice of dark-coloured victims to Freyr has a parallel in [[Ancient Greek religion]] where the [[chthonic]] fertility deities preferred dark-coloured victims to white ones.

In book 9, Saxo identifies Frø as the "king of Sweden" (''rex Suetiae''):

{|
|
Quo tempore rex Suetiae Frø, interfecto Norvagiensium rege Sywardo, coniuges necessariorum eius prostibulo relegatas publice constuprandas exhibuit. ''Gesta Danorum'' 9, [http://www.kb.dk/elib/lit/dan/saxo/lat/or.dsr/9/4/index.htm Olrik's edition]
|
About this time the Swedish ruler Frø, after killing Sivard, king of the Norwegians, removed the wives of Sivard's relatives to a brothel and exposed them to public prostitution. ''Gesta Danorum'' 9, Fisher's translation
|
|}

The reference to public prostitution may be a memory of fertility cult practices. Such a memory may also be the source of a description in book 6 of the stay of [[Starcatherus]], a follower of Odin, in Sweden.

{|
|
Mortuo autem Bemono, Starcatherus ab athletis Biarmensibus ob virtutem accitus, cum plurima apud eos memoratu digna edidisset facinora, Sueonum fines ingreditur. Ubi cum filiis Frø septennio feriatus ab his tandem ad Haconem Daniae tyrannum se contulit, quod apud Upsalam sacrificiorum tempore constitutus effeminatos corporum motus scaenicosque mimorum plausus ac mollia nolarum crepitacula fastidiret. Unde patet, quam remotum a lascivia animum habuerit, qui ne eius quidem spectator esse sustinuit. Adeo virtus luxui resistit. ''Gesta Danorum'' 6, [http://www.kb.dk/elib/lit/dan/saxo/lat/or.dsr/6/5/index.htm Olrik's edition]
|
After Bemoni's death Starkather, because of his valour, was summoned by the Biarmian champions and there performed many feats worthy of the tellings. Then he entered Swedish territory where he spent seven years in a leisurely stay with the sons of Frø, after which he departed to join Haki, the lord of Denmark, for, living at Uppsala in the period of sacrifices, he had become disgusted with the womanish body movements, the clatter of actors on the stage and the soft tinkling of bells. It is obvious how far his heart was removed from frivolity if he could not even bear to watch these occasions. A manly individual is resistant to wantonness. ''Gesta Danorum'' 6, Fisher's translation

==Yngvi==
{{main|Yngvi}}
A strophe of the Anglo-Saxon [[rune poem]] (c. 1100) records that:

:''Ing was first among the [[East Dane]]s seen by men''

This may refer to the origins of the worship of '''[[Ingui]]''' in the tribal areas that [[Tacitus]] mentions in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' as being populated by the Inguieonnic tribes. A later Danish chronicler lists Ingui was one of three brothers that the Danish tribes descended from. The strophe also states that "then he (Ingui) went back over the waves, his wagon behind him" which could connect Ingui to earlier conceptions of the wagon processions of [[Nerthus]] and the later Scandinavian conceptions of Freyr's wagon journeys.

Ingui is mentioned also in some later Anglo-Saxon literature under varying forms of his name, such as "For what doth Ingeld have to do with Christ" and the variants used in [[Beowulf]] to designate the kings as 'leader of the friends of Ing'. The compound Ingui-Frea (OE) and Yngvi-Freyr (ON) likely refer to the connection between the god and the [[Germanic king]]s' role as priests during the sacrifices in the pagan period, as ''Frea'' and ''Freyr'' are titles meaning 'Lord'.

The Swedish royal dynasty was known as the [[Yngling]]s from their descent from Yngvi-Freyr. This is supported by Tacitus, who wrote about the Germans: "In their ancient songs, their only way of remembering or recording the past they celebrate an earth-born god [[Tuisco]], and his son [[Mannus]], as the origin of their race, as their founders. To Mannus they assign three sons, from whose names, they say, the coast tribes are called [[Ingaevones]]; those of the interior, [[Herminones]]; all the rest, [[Istaevones]]".

==Archaeological record==

===Rällinge statuette===
In 1904, a [[Viking Age]] statuette identified as a depiction of Freyr was discovered on the farm Rällinge in [[Lunda, Södermanland]] parish in the province of [[Södermanland]], Sweden. The depiction features a cross-legged seated, bearded male with an erect penis. He is wearing a pointed cap and stroking his triangular beard. The statue is 9 centimeters tall and is displayed at the [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]].&lt;ref name="NATANTSTAT"&gt;Swedish Museum of National Antiquities inventory number 14232. Viewable online: [http://www.historiska.se/historia/jarnaldern/vikingar/hedniskagudar/relaterade-bilder-hedniska-gudar/frejstatyett/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skog tapestry===
{{main|Skog tapestry}}
A part of the Swedish Skog tapestry depicts three figures that has been interpreted as allusions to Odin, Thor, and Freyr,&lt;ref&gt;Leiren, Terje I. (1999). ''From Pagan to Christian: The Story in the 12th-Century Tapestry of the Skog Church''. Published online: http://faculty.washington.edu/leiren/vikings2.html&lt;/ref&gt; but also as the three Scandinavian holy kings [[Canute IV of Denmark|Canute]], [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric]] and [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf]]. The figures coincide with 11th century descriptions of statue arrangements recorded by Adam of Bremen at the Temple at Uppsala and written accounts of the gods during the late Viking Age. The tapestry is originally from [[Hälsingland]], Sweden but is now housed at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities.

===Gullgubber===
{{main|Gullgubber}}
Small pieces of gold foil featuring engravings dating from the [[Migration Period]] into the early [[Viking Age]] (known as ''[[gullgubber]]'') have been discovered in various locations in [[Scandinavia]], at one site almost 2,500. The foil pieces have been found largely on the sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes a man and a woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] says that it has been suggested that the figures are taking part in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the [[Vanir]] group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Skírnismál]]''; the coming together of Gerðr and Freyr.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON121"&gt;Davidson (1988:121).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fuel economy''' of an automobile relates distance traveled by a vehicle and the amount of [[fuel]] consumed. Consumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance, or the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed. Since fuel consumption of vehicles is a significant factor in air pollution, and since importation of motor fuel can be a large part of a nation's foreign trade, many countries impose requirements for fuel economy. Different methods are used to approximate the actual performance of the vehicle. The energy in fuel is required to overcome various losses (wind resistance, tire drag, and others) encountered while propelling the vehicle, and in providing power to vehicle systems such as ignition or air conditioning. Various strategies can be employed to reduce losses at each of the conversions between the chemical energy in the fuel and the kinetic energy of the vehicle. Driver behavior can affect fuel economy; maneuvers such as sudden acceleration and heavy braking waste energy.

Electric cars do not directly burn fuel, and so do not have fuel economy per se, but equivalence measures, such as [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] have been created to attempt to compare them.

==Units of measure==
[[File:Chart MPG to L-100km v2009-10-08.svg|thumb|right|400px|MPG to L/100 km conversion chart: blue, U.S. [[gallon]]; red, imperial gallon.]]
Fuel economy is the relationship between the distance traveled and fuel consumed.

Fuel economy can be expressed in two ways:

;Units of fuel per fixed distance: Generally expressed as liters per 100 kilometers  (L/100&amp;nbsp;km), used in most European countries, China, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. British, Irish and Canadian law allow for the use of either liters per 100 kilometers or miles per imperial [[gallon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejournal.ie/dear-driver-what-is-good-mpg-3150884-Dec2016/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oee.nrcan.gc.ca/transportation/tools/fuelratings/ratings-search.cfm?attr=8 |title=Fuel Consumption Ratings |accessdate=8 June 2011 |date=January 2011 |publisher=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/programs/environment-fcp-faq-139.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105235332/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/programs/environment-fcp-faq-139.htm |archivedate=5 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/3523/schedule/1/made |title=The Passenger Car (Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information) Regulations 2001
|date=2001 |accessdate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the [[Monroney sticker|window sticker]] on new US cars has started displaying the vehicle's fuel consumption in US gallons per 100 miles, in addition to the traditional MPG number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/label/learn-more-gasoline-label.shtml The New Fuel Economy Label] at FuelEconomy.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

;Units of distance per fixed fuel unit: [[Mile]]s per [[gallon]] (mpg) is commonly used in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada (alongside L/100&amp;nbsp;km). Kilometers per liter (km/L) is more commonly used elsewhere in the Americas, Asia, parts of Africa and Oceania. In Arab countries km/20&amp;nbsp;L, which is known as kilometers per ''tanaka'' (or ''Tanakeh'') is used, where ''tanaka'' is a [[Jerrycan|metal container]] which has a volume of twenty liters. Both mpg and km/L are units of distance per fixed fuel amount (the increase of the value represents economic fuel consumption) whereas L/100&amp;nbsp;km is a unit of fuel consumption per a fixed unit of distance (the increase of the value represents large/bad fuel consumption). When the mpg unit is used, it is necessary to identify the type of gallon used: the imperial gallon is 4.54609 liters, and the U.S. gallon is 3.785 liters.

==Fuel economy statistics==
While the [[thermal efficiency]] (mechanical output to chemical energy in fuel) of petroleum [[internal combustion engine|engines]]  has increased since the beginning of the [[History of the automobile|automotive era]] to  a current maximum of 36.4% &lt;ref&gt;https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2004-01-0064/&lt;/ref&gt;  this is not the only factor in fuel economy. The design of automobile as a whole and usage pattern affects the fuel economy. Published fuel economy is subject to variation between jurisdiction due to variations in testing protocols.

One of the first studies to determine fuel economy in the United States was the '''[[Mobil Economy Run]]''', which was an event that took place every year from 1936 (except during [[World War II]]) to 1968. It was designed to provide real [[fuel efficiency]] numbers during a coast to coast test on real roads and with regular traffic and weather conditions. The [[Mobil]] Oil Corporation sponsored it and the [[United States Auto Club]] (USAC) sanctioned and operated the run. In more recent studies, the average fuel economy for new passenger car in the United States improved from 17 mpg (13.8 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) in 1978 to more than 22 mpg (10.7 L/100&amp;nbsp;km) in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;

===Speed and fuel economy studies===
[[File:Fuel economy vs speed 1997.png|thumb|1997 fuel economy statistics for various US models]]
Fuel economy at steady speeds with selected vehicles was studied in 2010. The most recent study&lt;ref name=ornl&gt;[http://cta.ornl.gov/data/tedb31/Edition31_Full_Doc.pdf Steady Speed Fuel Economy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924201205/http://cta.ornl.gov/data/tedb31/Edition31_Full_Doc.pdf |date=24 September 2012 }} "The two earlier studies by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) indicate maximum fuel efficiency was achieved at speeds of 35 to 40 mph (55 to 65 km/h). The recent FHWA study indicates greater fuel efficiency at higher speeds."&lt;/ref&gt; indicates greater fuel efficiency at higher speeds than earlier studies; for example, some vehicles achieve better fuel economy at {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} rather than at {{convert|70|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=ornl/&gt; although not their best economy, such as the 1994 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera]] with the [[General Motors 122 engine#LN2|LN2]] 2.2L engine, which has its best economy at {{convert|90|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} ({{convert|8.1|L/100 km|mpgus|abbr=on}}), and gets better economy at {{convert|105|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} than at {{convert|72|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} ({{convert|9.4|L/100 km|mpgus|abbr=on}} vs {{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}}). The proportion of driving on [[Highway safety#Motorway|high speed roadways]] varies from 4% in Ireland to 41% in the Netherlands.

When the US [[National Maximum Speed Law]]'s {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit was mandated, there were complaints that fuel economy could decrease instead of increase. The 1997 Toyota Celica got better fuel-efficiency at {{convert|105|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} than it did at {{convert|65|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} ({{convert|5.41|L/100 km|mpgus|abbr=on}} vs {{convert|5.53|L/100 km|mpgus|abbr=on}}), although even better at {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} than at {{convert|65|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} ({{convert|48.4|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}} vs {{convert|43.5|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}}), and its best economy ({{convert|52.6|mpgus|L/100 km|abbr=on}}) at only {{convert|25|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Other vehicles tested had from 1.4 to 20.2% better fuel-efficiency at {{convert|90|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} vs. {{convert|105|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. Their best economy was reached at speeds of {{convert|40|to|90|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} (see graph).&lt;ref name=ornl/&gt;

Officials hoped that the {{convert|55|mph|abbr=on}} limit, combined with a ban on ornamental lighting, no gasoline sales on Sunday, and a 15% cut in gasoline production, would reduce total gas consumption by 200,000 barrels a day, representing a 2.2% drop from annualized 1973 gasoline consumption levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Politics and Energy: Nixon's Silence on Rationing Reflects Hope That Austerity Can Be Avoided |accessdate=22 July 2008 |last= Cowan |first= Edward |url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=5&amp;did=91035333&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=2&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1216742176&amp;clientId=57025 |work= The New York Times |page= 30 |date= 27 November 1973}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The 2.2% drop figure was calculated by finding daily consumption to be 9,299,684 barrels of petroleum.

==Energy considerations==
{{Expand section|date=June 2007}}
Since the total force opposing the vehicle's motion (at constant speed) multiplied by the distance through which the vehicle travels represents the work that the vehicle's engine must perform, the study of fuel economy (the amount of energy consumed per unit of distance traveled) requires a detailed analysis of the forces that oppose a vehicle's motion. In terms of physics, Force = rate at which the amount of work generated (energy delivered) varies with the distance traveled, or:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{dW}{ds} \propto \text{Fuel economy}&lt;/math&gt;

Note: The amount of work generated by the vehicle's power source (energy delivered by the engine) would be exactly proportional to the amount of fuel energy consumed by the engine if the engine's efficiency is the same regardless of power output, but this is not necessarily the case due to the operating characteristics of the internal combustion engine.

For a vehicle whose source of power is a heat engine (an engine that uses heat to perform useful work), the amount of fuel energy that a vehicle consumes per unit of distance (level road) depends upon:

# The [[Internal combustion engine#Energy efficiency|thermodynamic efficiency of the heat engine]];
# The forces of friction within the mechanical system that delivers engine output to the wheels;
# The forces of friction in the wheels and between the road and the wheels (rolling friction);
# Other internal forces that the engine works against (electrical generator, air conditioner, water pump, engine fan, etc.);
# External forces that resist motion (e.g., wind, rain);
# Non-regenerative braking force (brakes that turn motion energy into heat rather than storing it in a useful form; e.g., electrical energy in hybrid vehicles);
# Fuel consumed while the engine is on standby and not powering the wheels, i.e., while the vehicle is coasting, braking or idling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/sr/sr286.pdf|title=TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD SPECIAL REPORT 286 TIRES AND PASSENGER VEHICLE FUEL ECONOMY, Transportation Research Board, National Academy of Sciences p.62-65 of pdf, p.39-42 of report.

Ideally, a car traveling at a constant velocity on level ground in a vacuum with frictionless wheels could travel at any speed without consuming any energy beyond what is needed to get the car up to speed. Less ideally, any vehicle must expend energy on overcoming road load forces, which consist of aerodynamic drag, tire rolling resistance, and inertial energy that is lost when the vehicle is decelerated by friction brakes. With ideal [[regenerative braking]], the inertial energy could be completely recovered, but there are few options for reducing aerodynamic drag or rolling resistance other than optimizing the vehicle's shape and the tire design. Road load energy, or the energy demanded at the wheels, can be calculated by evaluating the vehicle equation of motion over a specific driving cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtual-car.org/wheels/wheels-road-load-calculation.html Wheels, online road load and MPG calculator]. Virtual-car.org (2009-08-03). Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle powertrain must then provide this minimum energy in order to move the vehicle, and will lose a large amount of additional energy in the process of converting fuel energy into work and transmitting it to the wheels. Overall, the sources of energy loss in moving a vehicle may be summarized as follows:
* [[Engine efficiency]] (20–30%),&lt;ref name=washedu/&gt; which varies with engine type, the mass of the automobile and its load, and engine speed (usually measured in [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]).
* [[Aerodynamic drag]] force, which increases roughly by the [[drag equation|square of the car's speed]], but note that [[Drag power|drag power goes by the cube of the car's speed]].
* [[Rolling friction]].
* Braking, although [[regenerative braking]] captures some of the energy that would otherwise be lost.
* Losses in the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. [[Manual transmission]]s can be up to 94% efficient whereas older [[automatic transmission]]s may be as low as 70% efficient&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sae.org/servlets/productDetail?PROD_TYP=PAPER&amp;PROD_CD=1999-01-1259 An Overview of Current Automatic, Manual and Continuously Variable Transmission Efficiencies and Their Projected Future Improvements]. SAE.org (1999-03-01). Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Automatically controlled shifting of gearboxes that have the same internals as manual boxes will give the same efficiency as a pure manual gearbox plus the bonus of added intelligence selecting optimal shifting points
* Air conditioning. The power required for the engine to turn the compressor decreases the fuel-efficiency, though only when in use. This may be offset by the reduced drag of the vehicle compared with driving with the windows down. The efficiency of AC systems gradually deteriorates due to dirty filters etc.; regular maintenance prevents this. The extra mass of the air conditioning system will cause a slight increase in fuel consumption.
* Power steering. Older hydraulic power steering systems are powered by a hydraulic pump constantly engaged to the engine. Power assistance required for steering is inversely proportional to the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a hydraulic pump reduces fuel efficiency. More modern designs improve fuel efficiency by only activating the power assistance when needed; this is done by using either direct electrical power steering assistance or an electrically powered hydraulic pump.
* Cooling. Older cooling systems used a constantly engaged mechanical fan to draw air through the radiator at a rate directly related to the engine speed. This constant load reduces efficiency. More modern systems use electrical fans to draw additional air through the radiator when extra cooling is required.
* Electrical systems. Headlights, battery charging, active suspension, circulating fans, defrosters, media systems, speakers, and other electronics can also significantly increase fuel consumption, as the energy to power these devices causes increased load on the alternator. Since alternators are commonly only 40–60% efficient, the added load from electronics on the engine can be as high as {{convert|3|hp}} at any speed including idle. In the FTP 75 cycle test, a 200 watt load on the alternator reduces fuel efficiency by 1.7&amp;nbsp;MPG.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt; Headlights, for example, consume 110 watts on low and up to 240 watts on high. These electrical loads can cause much of the discrepancy between real world and EPA tests, which only include the electrical loads required to run the engine and basic climate control.
* Standby.  The energy needed to keep the engine running while it is not providing power to the wheels, i.e., when stopped, coasting or braking.

Fuel-efficiency decreases from electrical loads are most pronounced at lower speeds because most electrical loads are constant while engine load increases with speed. So at a lower speed a higher proportion of engine horsepower is used by electrical loads.  Hybrid cars see the greatest effect on fuel-efficiency from electrical loads because of this proportional effect.

Many [[Aftermarket fuel economy device|aftermarket consumer products]] exist that are purported to increase fuel economy; many of these claims have been discredited. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of devices that have been tested by independent laboratories and makes the test results available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/otaq/consumer/reports.htm Gas Saving and Emission Reduction Devices Evaluation | Cars and Light Trucks | US EPA]. Epa.gov. Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel economy data reliability===
The mandatory publication of the fuel consumption by the manufacturer led some to use dubious practices to reach better values in the past. If the test is on a test stand, the vehicle may detect open doors and adapt the engine control. Also when driven according to the test regime, the parameters may adapt automatically. Test laboratories use a "golden car" that is tested in each one to check that each lab produces the same set of measurements for a given drive cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsc-aamg.org/Documents/Papers/ENSpeakerAbstracts.pdf Environmental Nanoparticles – Exploring the links between Vehicle Emissions and Ambient Air] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413221045/http://rsc-aamg.org/Documents/Papers/ENSpeakerAbstracts.pdf |date=13 April 2008 }}. (PDF). A meeting of the Automation and Analytical Management Group of the Royal Society of Chemistry. 8 June 2005. Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tire pressures and lubricants have to be as recommended by the manufacturer (Higher tire pressures are required on a particular [[Dynamometer|dynamometer type]], but this is to compensate for the different rolling resistance of the dynamometer, not to produce an unrealistic load on the vehicle). Normally the quoted figures a manufacturer publishes have to be proved by the relevant authority witnessing vehicle/engine tests. Some jurisdictions independently test emissions of vehicles in service, and as a final measure can force a recall of all of a particular type of vehicle if the customer vehicles do not fulfill manufacturers' claims within reasonable limits. The expense and bad publicity from such a recall encourages manufacturers to publish realistic figures. The US Federal government retests 10–15% of models&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/how_tested.shtml EPA]. Fueleconomy.gov. Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;), to make sure that the manufacturer's tests are accurate.

Real world fuel consumption can vary greatly as they can be affected by many factors that have little to do with the vehicle.  Driving conditions – weather, traffic, temperature; driving style – hard braking, jack rabbit starts, and speeding; road conditions – paved vs gravel, smooth vs potholes; and things like carrying excess weight, roof racks, and fuel quality can all combine to dramatically increase fuel consumption.  Expecting to consistently perform in the face of so many variables is impossible as is the expectation for one set of numbers to encompass every driver and their personal circumstances.

The ratings are meant to provide a comparison, and are not a promise of actual performance.

===Concerns over EPA estimates===
For many years critics had claimed that '''EPA''' (U.S. ''Environmental Protection Agency'') estimated fuel economy figures had been misleading. The primary arguments of the EPA detractors were focused on the lack of real world testing, and the very limited scale (i.e., city or highway).

Partly as a response to these criticisms, the EPA changed their fuel economy rating system in 2008 in an attempt to more adequately address these concerns. Instead of testing simply in two presumed modes, the testing now covers:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/mpg/MPG.do?action=browseList Vehicle Selection – Make]. Fueleconomy.gov. Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Faster speeds and acceleration
* Air conditioner use
* Colder outside temperatures

While the new EPA standards may represent an improvement, real world user data may still be the best way to gather and collect accurate fuel economy information. As such the EPA has also set up a [http://www.fueleconomy.gov/mpg/MPG.do?action=browseList http://www.fueleconomy.gov/mpg/MPG.do?action=browseList website] where drivers can enter and track their own real-world fuel economy numbers.

There are also a number of websites that attempt to track and report individual user fuel economy data through real-life driving. Sites or publications such as [[Consumer Reports]], [[Edmunds.com]], [[Consumer Guide]] and [[TrueDelta]].com offer this service and claim more accurate numbers than those listed by the EPA.

===Fuel economy maximizing behaviors===
{{Main|Fuel economy-maximizing behaviors}}
Governments, various environmentalist organizations, and companies like [[Toyota]] and [[Shell Oil Company]] have historically urged drivers to maintain adequate air pressure in [[tire]]s and careful acceleration/deceleration habits. Keeping track of  fuel efficiency stimulates fuel economy-maximizing behavior.&lt;ref&gt;https://onfuel.appspot.com keep track of fuel efficiency&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-year partnership between [[Michelin]] and [[Anglian Water]] shows that 60,000 liters of fuel can be saved on tire pressure. The Anglian Water fleet of 4,000 vans and cars are now lasting their full lifetime. This shows the impact that tire pressures have on the fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anglian Water spot on with pressure test|url = http://www.tyrepress.com/2015/10/anglian-water-spot-on-with-pressure-test/|website = Tyrepress|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel economy as part of quality management regimes===
Environmental management systems [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|EMAS]] as well as good fleet management includes record keeping of the fleet fuel consumption. Quality management uses those figures to steer the measures acting on the fleets. This is a way to check whether procurement, driving, and maintenance in total have contributed to changes in the fleet's overall consumption.

===Australia===
From October 2008, all new cars had to be sold with a sticker on the windscreen showing the fuel consumption and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/roads/environment/index.aspx Vehicles &amp; the Environment]. Infrastructure.gov.au. Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel consumption figures are expressed as ''urban'', ''extra urban'' and ''combined'', measured according to [[ECE Regulations]] 83 and 101 – which are the based on the [[New European Driving Cycle|European driving cycle]]; previously, only the ''combined'' number was given.

Australia also uses a star rating system, from one to five stars, that combines greenhouse gases with pollution, rating each from 0 to 10 with ten being best. To get 5 stars a combined score of 16 or better is needed, so a car with a 10 for economy (greenhouse) and a 6 for emission or 6 for economy and 10 for emission, or anything in between would get the highest 5 star rating.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716024739/http://www.greenvehicleguide.gov.au/GVGPublicUI/home.aspx Information on Green Vehicle Guide Ratings and Measurement]. Australian Department of Infrastructure and Transport&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest rated car is the [[SsangYong Korando|Ssangyong Korrando]] with automatic transmission, with one star, while the highest rated was the Toyota Prius hybrid. The Fiat 500, Fiat Punto and Fiat Ritmo as well as the Citroen C3 also received 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenvehicleguide.gov.au/ Green Vehicle Guide]. Green Vehicle Guide. Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The greenhouse rating depends on the fuel economy and the type of fuel used. A greenhouse rating of 10 requires 60 or less grams of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per km, while a rating of zero is more than 440 g/km CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The highest greenhouse rating of any 2009 car listed is the Toyota Prius, with 106&amp;nbsp;g/km CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and {{convert|4.4|L/100 km|abbr=on }}. Several other cars also received the same rating of 8.5 for greenhouse. The lowest rated was the Ferrari 575 at 499&amp;nbsp;g/km CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and {{convert|21.8|L/100 km|abbr=on }}.&lt;!--The Ferrari is incorrectly given a rating of 0.5 instead of zero.--&gt; The Bentley also received a zero rating, at 465&amp;nbsp;g/km CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The best fuel economy of any year is the 2004–2005 [[Honda Insight]], at {{convert|3.4|L/100 km|abbr=on }}.

===Canada===
Vehicle manufacturers follow a controlled laboratory testing procedure to generate the fuel consumption data that they submit to the Government of Canada. This controlled method of fuel consumption testing, including the use of standardized fuels, test cycles and calculations, is used instead of on-road driving to ensure that all vehicles are tested under identical conditions and that the results are consistent and repeatable.

Selected test vehicles are “run in” for about 6,000&amp;nbsp;km before testing. The vehicle is then mounted on a chassis dynamometer programmed to take into account the aerodynamic efficiency, weight and rolling resistance of the vehicle. A trained driver runs the vehicle through standardized driving cycles that simulate trips in the city and on the highway. Fuel consumption ratings are derived from the emissions generated during the driving cycles.&lt;ref name="nrcan.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/transportation/cars-light-trucks/buying/7495|title=5-cycle testing|website=www.nrcan.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

THE 5 CYCLE TEST:

1. The '''city test''' simulates urban driving in stop-and-go traffic with an average speed of 34&amp;nbsp;km/h and a top speed of 90&amp;nbsp;km/h. The test runs for approximately 31 minutes and includes 23 stops.  The test begins from a cold engine start, which is similar to starting a vehicle after it has been parked overnight during the summer. The final phase of the test repeats the first eight minutes of the cycle but with a hot engine start. This simulates restarting a vehicle after it has been warmed up, driven and then stopped for a short time. Over five minutes of test time are spent idling, to represent waiting at traffic lights. The ambient temperature of the test cell starts at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and ends at 30&amp;nbsp;°C.

2. The '''highway test''' simulates a mixture of open highway and rural road driving, with an average speed of 78&amp;nbsp;km/h and a top speed of 97&amp;nbsp;km/h. The test runs for approximately 13 minutes and does not include any stops. The test begins from a hot engine start. The ambient temperature of the test cell starts at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and ends at 30&amp;nbsp;°C.

3. In the '''cold temperature operation test''', the same driving cycle is used as in the standard '''city test''', except that the ambient temperature of the test cell is set to −7&amp;nbsp;°C.

4. In the '''air conditioning test''', the ambient temperature of the test cell is raised to 35&amp;nbsp;°C. The vehicle's climate control system is then used to lower the internal cabin temperature. Starting with a warm engine, the test averages 35&amp;nbsp;km/h and reaches a maximum speed of 88&amp;nbsp;km/h. Five stops are included, with idling occurring 19% of the time.

5. The '''high speed/quick acceleration test''' averages 78&amp;nbsp;km/h and reaches a top speed of 129&amp;nbsp;km/h. Four stops are included and brisk acceleration maximizes at a rate of 13.6&amp;nbsp;km/h per second. The engine begins warm and air conditioning is not used. The ambient temperature of the test cell is constantly 25&amp;nbsp;°C.

Tests 1, 3, 4 &amp; 5 are averaged to create the city driving fuel consumption rate.

Tests 2, 4 &amp; 5 are averaged to create the highway driving fuel consumption rate.&lt;ref name="nrcan.gc.ca"/&gt;

===Europe===
[[File:Irish Car CO2 Label.svg|thumb|right|Irish fuel economy label.]]
{{main|New European Driving Cycle}}
In the European Union, passenger vehicles are commonly tested using two drive cycles, and corresponding fuel economies are reported as 'urban' and 'extra-urban', in litres per 100&amp;nbsp;km and (in the UK) in miles per imperial gallon.

The urban economy is measured using the test cycle known as ECE-15, first introduced in 1970 by EC Directive 70/220/EWG and finalized by EEC Directive 90/C81/01 in 1999. It simulates a 4,052&amp;nbsp;m (2.518&amp;nbsp;mile) urban trip at an average speed of 18.7&amp;nbsp;km/h (11.6&amp;nbsp;mph) and at a maximum speed of 50&amp;nbsp;km/h (31&amp;nbsp;mph).

The extra-urban driving cycle or EUDC lasts 400 seconds (6&amp;nbsp;minutes 40 seconds) at an average speed 62.6&amp;nbsp;km/h (39&amp;nbsp;mph) and a top speed of 120&amp;nbsp;km/h (74.6&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref&gt;[http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514269543/html/x787.html Vehicle test cycles]. Herkules.oulu.fi. Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

EU fuel consumption numbers are often considerably lower than corresponding US EPA test results for the same vehicle. For example, the 2011 [[Honda CR-Z]] with a six-speed manual transmission is rated 6.1/4.4 L/100&amp;nbsp;km in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honda.de/news/common_news_70673.php|title=Honda-Frühstück am 15. Januar 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 7.6/6.4 L/100&amp;nbsp;km (31/37 mpg ) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/Spec_Glance.aspx?year=2011&amp;make=Honda&amp;model=CR-Z|title=2011 Honda CR-Z Specs and Features}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union advertising has to show [[Carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-emission and fuel consumption data in a clear way as described in the UK Statutory Instrument 2004 No 1661.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vca.gov.uk/additional/files/fcb--co2/enforcement-on-advertising/vca061.pdf Guidance notes and examples]. (PDF) . Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 2005 a colour-coded "Green Rating" sticker has been available in the UK, which rates fuel economy by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions: A: &amp;lt;= 100 g/km, B: 100–120, C: 121–150, D: 151–165, E: 166–185, F: 186–225, and G: 226+.

In the UK the ASA (Advertising standards agency) have claimed that fuel consumption figures are misleading. Often the case with European vehicles as the MPG (miles per gallon) figures that can be advertised are often not the same as 'real world' driving.

The ASA have said that Car manufacturers can use ‘cheats’ to prepare their vehicles for their compulsory fuel efficiency and emissions tests in a way set out to make themselves look as ‘clean’ as possible. This practice is common in petrol and diesel vehicle tests, but hybrid and electric vehicles are not immune as manufacturers apply these techniques to fuel efficiency.

Car experts{{who|date=November 2015}} also assert that the ''official'' MPG figures given by manufacturers do not represent the ''true'' MPG values from real-world driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the EC figures do not represent true MPG |url=http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/realmpg/why-are-the-ec-figures-so-optimistic-true-mpg/ |work=Honest John |accessdate=14 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Websites have been set up to show the real-world MPG figures, based on crowd-sourced data from real users, vs the official MPG figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Life Fuel Economy (MPG) Register |url=http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/realmpg/ |work=Honest John |accessdate=14 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major loopholes in the current EU tests allow car manufacturers a number of ‘cheats’ to improve results. Car manufacturers can:
* Disconnect the alternator, thus no energy is used to recharge the battery;
* Use special lubricants that are not used in production cars, in order to reduce friction;
* Turn off all electrical gadgets i.e. Air Con/Radio;
* Adjust brakes or even disconnect them to reduce friction;
* Tape up cracks between body panels and windows to reduce air resistance;
* Remove Wing mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carsandgarages.co.uk/news/29-ASA-says-fuel-consumption-figures-are-mis|title=Cars and Garages: Diagnose Problems, Estimate Costs &amp; Find Garages|website=www.carsandgarages.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the results of a 2014 study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), the gap between official and real-world fuel-economy figures in Europe has risen to about 38% in 2013 from 10% in 2001. The analysis found that for private cars, the difference between on-road and official {{CO2}} values rose from around 8% in 2001 to 31% in 2013, and 45% for company cars in 2013. The report is based on data from more than half a million private and company vehicles across Europe. The analysis was prepared by the ICCT together with the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] (TNO), and the German Institut für Energie- und Umweltforschung Heidelberg (IFEU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/09/20140928-icct.html|title=ICCT: gap between official and real-world fuel economy figures in Europe reaches ~38%; call to implement WLTP ASAP|author=Mike Millikin|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=2014-09-28|accessdate=2014-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===

===Japan===
The evaluation criteria used in Japan reflects driving conditions commonly found, as the typical Japanese driver doesn't drive as fast as other regions internationally ([[Speed limits in Japan]])

====10–15 mode====
The 10–15 mode [[driving cycle]] test is the official fuel economy and emission certification test for new light duty vehicles in Japan. Fuel economy is expressed in km/L (kilometers per litre) and emissions are expressed in g/km. The test is carried out on a [[dynamometer]] and consist of 25 tests which cover idling, acceleration, steady running and deceleration, and simulate typical Japanese urban and/or expressway driving conditions. The running pattern begins with a warm start, lasts for 660 seconds (11 minutes) and runs at speeds up to {{convert|70|km/h|mi/h|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=JapTest01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jama-english.jp/europe/news/2009/no_2/peternunn.html|title=From 10•15 to JC08: Japan’s new economy formula|author=[[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] (JAMA)|publisher=News from JAMA|year=2009|accessdate=9 April 2012}} ''Issue No. 2, 2009''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JapTest02&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselnet.com/standards/cycles/jp_10-15mode.php|title=Japanese 10–15 Mode|publisher=Diesel.net|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distance of the cycle is {{convert|6.34|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, average speed of {{convert|25.6|km/h|mi/h|1|abbr=on}}, and duration 892 seconds (14.9 minutes), including the initial 15 mode segment.&lt;ref name=JapTest02/&gt;

====JC08====
A new more demanding test, called the JC08, was established in December 2006 for Japan’s new standard that goes into effect in 2015, but it is already being used by several car manufacturers for new cars. The JC08 test is significantly longer and more rigorous than the 10–15 mode test. The running pattern with JC08 stretches out to 1200 seconds (20 minutes), and there are both cold and warm start measurements and top speed is {{convert|82|km/h|mi/h|1|abbr=on}}. The economy ratings of the JC08 are lower than the 10–15 mode cycle, but they are expected to be more real world.&lt;ref name=JapTest01/&gt; The [[Toyota Prius]] became the first car to meet Japan’s new 2015 Fuel Economy Standards measured under the JC08 test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/08/prius-certified.html|title=Prius Certified to Japanese 2015 Fuel Economy Standards with JC08 Test Cycle|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=11 August 2007|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting on 7 April 2008 all cars of up to 3.5 tonnes GVW sold other than private sale need to have a fuel economy sticker applied (if available) that shows the rating from one half star to six stars with the most economic cars having the most stars and the more fuel hungry cars the least, along with the fuel economy in L/100&amp;nbsp;km and the estimated annual fuel cost for driving 14,000&amp;nbsp;km (at present fuel prices). The stickers must also appear on vehicles to be leased for more than 4&amp;nbsp;months.

====US Energy Tax Act====
{{Main|Energy Tax Act}}
The [[Energy Tax Act]] of 1978&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/info.shtml#guzzler Frequently Asked Questions]. Fueleconomy.gov. Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in the US established a gas guzzler tax on the sale of new model year vehicles whose fuel economy fails to meet certain statutory levels. The tax applies only to cars (not trucks) and is collected by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. Its purpose is to discourage the production and purchase of fuel-inefficient vehicles. The tax was phased in over ten years with rates increasing over time. It applies only to manufacturers and importers of vehicles, although presumably some or all of the tax is passed along to automobile consumers in the form of higher prices. Only new vehicles are subject to the tax, so no tax is imposed on used car sales. The tax is graduated to apply a higher tax rate for less-fuel-efficient vehicles. To determine the tax rate, manufacturers test all the vehicles at their laboratories for fuel economy. The US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] confirms a portion of those tests at an EPA lab.

In some cases, this tax may apply only to certain variants of a given model; for example, the 2004–2006 [[Holden Monaro#Pontiac GTO|Pontiac GTO]] (captive import version of the [[Holden Monaro]]) did incur the tax when ordered with the four-speed automatic transmission, but did not incur the tax when ordered with the six-speed manual transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cars.com/pontiac/gto/2005/reviews/?revid=47269 |title=2005 Pontiac GTO |date=28 April 2005 |author=Steven Cole Smith |publisher=Orlando Sentinel via Cars.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====EPA testing procedure through 2007====
[[File:Uddsdds.gif|thumb|200px|The "city" or Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) used in the EPA Federal Test Procedure]] [[File:Hwfetdds.gif|thumb|200px|The Highway Fuel Economy Driving Cycle (HWFET) used in the EPA Federal Test Procedure]]
Two separate fuel economy tests simulate city driving and highway driving: the "city" driving program or Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule or (UDDS) or [[FTP-72]] is defined in {{CodeFedReg|40|86|prefix=App|I}} and consists of starting with a cold engine and making 23 stops over a period of 31&amp;nbsp;minutes for an average speed of 20&amp;nbsp;mph (32&amp;nbsp;km/h) and with a top speed of 56&amp;nbsp;mph (90&amp;nbsp;km/h).

The "highway" program or Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule (HWFET) is defined in {{CodeFedReg|40|600|prefix=App|I}} and uses a warmed-up engine and makes no stops, averaging 48&amp;nbsp;mph (77&amp;nbsp;km/h) with a top speed of 60&amp;nbsp;mph (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) over a {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=on}} distance. The measurements are then adjusted downward by 10% (city) and 22% (highway) to more accurately reflect real-world results. A weighted average of city (55%) and highway (45%) fuel economies is used to determine the guzzler tax.&lt;ref name="EPA cycles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dynamometer Driver's Aid |url=http://www.epa.gov/nvfel/testing/dynamometer.htm |publisher=US EPA |accessdate=11 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330111359/http://www.epa.gov/nvfel/testing/dynamometer.htm |archivedate=30 March 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/28004-epa-fuel-economy-explained1.htm How the EPA Tests and Rates Fuel Economy]. Auto.howstuffworks.com (2005-09-07). Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure has been updated to [[FTP-75]], adding a "hot start" cycle which repeats the "cold start" cycle after a 10-minute pause.

Because EPA figures had almost always indicated better efficiency than real-world fuel-efficiency, the EPA has modified the method starting with 2008. Updated estimates are available for vehicles back to the 1985 model year.&lt;ref name="EPA cycles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.htm Find a Car 1985 to 2009].

====EPA testing procedure: 2008 and beyond====
[[File:Fuel economy label EPA 2008.jpg|thumb|right|2008 [[Monroney sticker]] highlights fuel economy.]]
US EPA altered the testing procedure effective MY2008 which adds three new [[FTP-75#Supplemental tests|Supplemental Federal Test Procedure]] (SFTP) tests to include the influence of higher driving speed, harder acceleration, colder temperature and air conditioning use.&lt;ref name=2008epa_test&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Ratings Changes|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/fe_test_schedules.shtml|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SFTP US06 is a high speed/quick acceleration loop that lasts 10&amp;nbsp;minutes, covers {{convert|8|mi|km}}, averages {{convert|48|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and reaches a top speed of {{convert|80|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Four stops are included, and brisk acceleration maximizes at a rate of {{convert|8.46|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} per second. The engine begins warm and air conditioning is not used. Ambient temperature varies between {{convert|68|°F|°C}} to {{convert|86|°F|°C}}.

SFTO SC03 is the air conditioning test, which raises ambient temperatures to {{convert|95|°F|°C}}, and puts the vehicle's climate control system to use. Lasting 9.9&amp;nbsp;minutes, the {{convert|3.6|mi|km|sing=on}} loop averages {{convert|22|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and maximizes at a rate of {{convert|54.8|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Five stops are included, idling occurs 19 percent of the time and acceleration of 5.1&amp;nbsp;mph/sec is achieved. Engine temperatures begin warm.

Lastly, a cold temperature cycle uses the same parameters as the current city loop, except that ambient temperature is set to {{convert|20|°F|°C}}.

EPA tests for fuel economy do not include electrical load tests beyond climate control, which may account for some of the discrepancy between EPA and real world fuel-efficiency. A 200&amp;nbsp;W electrical load can produce a 0.4&amp;nbsp;km/L (0.94&amp;nbsp;mpg) reduction in efficiency on the FTP 75 cycle test.&lt;ref name=ieee&gt;[http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/print/1420 Automotive Electrical Systems Circa 2005]. Spectrum.ieee.org. Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electric vehicles and hybrids====
[[File:Chevy Volt EPA Fuel Economy Official Label.png|thumb|left|2010 [[Monroney sticker]] for a [[plug-in hybrid]] showing fuel economy in [[all-electric mode]] and gas-only mode.]]
Following the efficiency claims made for vehicles such as [[Chevrolet Volt]] and [[Nissan Leaf]], the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] recommended to use EPA's new vehicle fuel efficiency formula that gives different values depending on fuel used.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Dan. (2009-10-01) [http://www.autoblog.com/2009/10/01/report-epa-planning-to-address-outlandish-fuel-economy-claims-o/ REPORT: EPA planning to address outlandish fuel economy claims of electric cars]. Autoblog.com. Retrieved 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010 the EPA introduced the first fuel economy ratings in the [[Monroney sticker]]s for [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s.

For the fuel economy label of the Chevy Volt [[plug-in hybrid]] EPA rated the car separately for [[all-electric mode]] expressed in [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]] (MPG-e) and for gasoline-only mode expressed in conventional miles per gallon. EPA also estimated an overall combined city/highway gas-electricity fuel economy rating expressed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPG-e). The label also includes a table showing fuel economy and electricity consumed for five different scenarios: {{convert|30|mi|km}},  {{convert|45|mi|km}},  {{convert|60|mi|km}} and {{convert|75|mi|km}} driven between a full charge, and a never charge scenario. This information was included in order to make the consumers aware of the variability of the fuel economy outcome depending on miles driven between charges. Also the fuel economy for a gasoline-only scenario (never charge) was included. For electric-only mode the energy consumption estimated in [[kWh]] per  {{convert|100|mi|km}} is also shown.&lt;ref name=GCCEPAVolt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/11/volt-20101124.html#more|title=Volt receives EPA ratings and label: 93 mpg-e all-electric, 37 mpg gas-only, 60 mpg-e combined|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=24 November 2010|accessdate=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPAmpge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/phevsbs.shtml|title=2011 Chevrolet Volt|publisher=Fueleconomy.gov|author=[[US Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[US Department of Energy]]|date=4 May 2011|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nissan Leaf EPA fuel economy label.jpg|thumb|2010 [[Monroney label]] showing the EPA's combined  city/highway [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent|fuel economy equivalent]] for an all-[[electric car]]]]

For the fuel economy label of the Nissan Leaf [[electric car]] EPA rated the combined fuel economy in terms of [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]], with a separate rating for city and highway driving. This fuel economy equivalence is based on the energy consumption estimated in [[kWh]] per 100 miles, and also shown in the Monroney label.&lt;ref name=NYTEPA&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/business/23leaf.html?_r=1&amp;hpw|title=Nissan Says Its Electric Leaf Gets Equivalent of 99 M.P.G.|work=The New York Times|author=Nick Bunkley|date=22 November 2010|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) and EPA issued a joint final rule establishing new requirements for a [[fuel economy and environment label]] that is mandatory for all new passenger cars and trucks starting with [[model year]] 2013, and voluntary for 2012 models. The ruling includes new labels for [[alternative fuel]] and [[alternative propulsion]] vehicles available in the US market, such as [[plug-in hybrid]]s, [[electric vehicle]]s, [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s, [[Fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell vehicle]], and [[natural gas vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name=EPA2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/carlabel/420f11017.htm|title=Fact Sheet: New Fuel Economy and Environment Labels for a New Generation of Vehicles|author=EPA|publisher=[[US Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=May 2011|accessdate=25 May 2011}} ''EPA-420-F-11-017''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GCC2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/felabel-20110525.html|title=EPA, DOT unveil the next generation of fuel economy labels|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common fuel economy metric adopted to allow the comparison of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles is [[miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent]] (MPGe). A gallon of gasoline equivalent means the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity, cubic feet of [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG), or kilograms of [[hydrogen]] that is equal to the energy in a gallon of gasoline.&lt;ref name=EPA2013/&gt;

The new labels also include for the first time an estimate of how much fuel or electricity it takes to drive {{Convert|100|mi}}, providing US consumers with fuel consumption per distance traveled, the metric commonly used in many other countries. EPA explained that the objective is to avoid the traditional miles per gallon metric that can be potentially misleading when consumers compare fuel economy improvements, and known as the "MPG illusion"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-14/not-all-fuel-efficiency-is-equal-understanding-the-miles-per-gallon-illusion|title=Not All Fuel Efficiency Is Equal: Understanding the Miles-Per-Gallon Illusion |date=2014-01-14 |accessdate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; – this illusion arises because the reciprocal (i.e. non-linear) relationship between cost (equivalently, volume of fuel consumed) per unit distance driven and MPG value means that ''differences'' in MPG values are not directly meaningful – only ratios are (in mathematical terms, the reciprocal function does not commute with addition and subtraction; in general, a difference in reciprocal values is not equal to the reciprocal of their difference). It has been claimed that many consumers are unaware of this, and therefore compare MPG values by subtracting them, which can give a misleading picture of relative differences in fuel economy between different pairs of vehicles – for instance, an increase from 10 to 20 MPG corresponds to a 100% improvement in fuel economy, whereas an increase from 50 to 60 MPG is only a 20% improvement, although in both cases the difference is 10 MPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2013/06/03/the-mpg-illusion/ |title=The MPG Illusion |date=2013-06-03 |accessdate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA explained that the new gallons-per-100-miles metric provides a more accurate measure of fuel efficiency&lt;ref name=EPA2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/business/energy-environment/26label.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1|title=New Mileage Stickers Include Greenhouse Gas Data|author=John M. Broder|work=The New York Times|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; – notably, it is equivalent to the normal metric measurement of fuel economy, liters per 100 kilometers (L/100&amp;nbsp;km).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; are federal regulations intended to improve the average fuel economy of cars and light trucks (trucks, vans and [[sport utility vehicle]]s) sold in the US in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 Arab Oil Embargo]]. Historically, it is the sales-weighted average fuel economy of a manufacturer's [[Fleet vehicle|fleet]] of current [[model year]] passenger cars or light trucks, manufactured for sale in the United States. Under Truck CAFE standards 2008–2011 this changes to a "footprint" model where larger trucks are allowed to consume more fuel. The standards were limited to vehicles under a certain weight, but those weight classes were expanded in 2011.

====State regulations====
The [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1970 prohibited states from establishing their own air pollution standards. However, the legislation authorized the EPA to grant a waiver to California, allowing the state to set higher standards.&lt;ref name=NYTApril18&gt;{{cite news |title=Calling car pollution standards ‘too high,’ EPA sets up fight with California |first=Hiroko |last=Tabuchi |date=April 2, 2018 |work=New York Times | |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/climate/trump-auto-emissions-rules.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law provides a “piggybacking” provision that allows other states to adopt vehicle emission limits that are the same as California’s.&lt;ref name=ELQSept03&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giovinazzo |first=Christopher  |date=September 2003 |title=California’s Global Warming Bill: Will Fuel Economy Preemption Curb California’s Air Pollution Leadership |url=https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1735&amp;context=elq |journal=Ecology Law Quarterly |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=901-902}}&lt;/ref&gt; California’s waivers were routinely granted until 2007, when the Bush administration rejected the state’s bid to adopt global warming pollution limits for cars and light trucks.&lt;ref name=NYTDec07&gt;{{cite news |title=EPA Denies California’s Emissions Waiver |first=Hiroko |last=Tabuchi |date=December 19, 2007 |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/washington/20epa-web.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; California and 15 other states that were trying to put in place the same emissions standards sued in response.&lt;ref name=WaPoJan08&gt;{{cite news |title=California Sues EPA Over Emissions Rules |first=Keith |last=Richburg |date=January 3, 2008 |work=Washington Post | |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/02/AR2008010202833.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was tied up in court until the administration of Barack Obama, which in 2009 reversed the Bush administration’s decision by granting the waiver.&lt;ref name=GTMJune09&gt;{{cite news |title=EPA grants California emissions waiver |first=Ucilia |last=Wang |date=June 30, 2009 |work=Greentech Media | |url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/epa-grants-california-emissions-waiver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced that the Trump administration planned to roll back the federal fuel economy standards put in place in 2012 and that it would also seek to curb California’s authority to set its own standards.&lt;ref name=NYTApril18 /&gt; However, the Trump administration is reportedly also in talks with state officials to develop a compromise that would allow the state and national standards to stay in place.&lt;ref name=NYT2018&gt;{{cite news |title=Quietly, Trump officials and California seek deal on emissions |first=Hiroko |last=Tabuchi |date=April 5, 2018 |work=New York Times | |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/climate/trump-california-emissions.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Govardhana Hill''' ({{lang-Deva|गोवर्धन}}), also called '''Mount Govardhana''', '''Giri Raj''' and '''Royal Hill''', is a sacred [[Hinduism|Hindu]] site in the [[Mathura district]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]] on an 8&amp;nbsp;km long hill located in the area of [[Govardhan]] and [[Radha Kund]],&lt;ref name="Prasad"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dev Prasad|title=Krishna: A Journey through the Lands &amp; Legends of Krishna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0_5caqiUH0C&amp;pg=PT147|date=January 27, 2015|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=978-81-8495-170-7|pages=PT 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keene"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry George Keene|title=A Handbook for Visitors to Agra and Its Neighbourhood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7w-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA71|year=1878|publisher=Thacker, Spink|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is about {{convert|20|km|mile}} from [[Vrindavan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://goo.gl/maps/RDnZE2sX2p72 |title=Vrindavan to Radha Kund |website=Google mpas |accessdate=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as Govardhan or Giriraj it is the sacred center of [[Braj]] and is identified as a natural form of the Lord [[Krishna]] himself ([[Govardhana sila]]).&lt;ref&gt;David L. Haberman, ''River of Love in an Age of Pollution: The Yamuna River of Northern India'', Page 264 {{ISBN|0-520-24789-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kapila D.

==Etymology==
The name 'Govardhana' has two primary translations. In the literal meaning, 'Go' translates to 'cows', and 'vardhana' translates to 'nourishment'. Another meaning of 'Go' is 'the senses' and 'vardhana' can also mean 'to increase' - thus the name is also translated by devotees of Krishna as 'that which increases the senses' in their attraction to Krishna. In this connection, it is believed that the personality of Govardhan blesses the devotee by increasing his devotion ([[bhakti]]). Thus, by residing in the foothills of Govardhan Hill, all the senses and the respective duties of a soul attain divinity and are more inclined to perform service to Krishna.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

== Geography ==
Govardhan Hill, stretching from Radha Kund to south of Govardhan, is a long ridge that, at its highest, stands a mere {{convert|100|feet|m}} above the surrounding land, belying artistic depictions of it as a steep hill. At the southern end of the hill is the village of Punchari, while at the crest stand the villages of Aanyor and Jatipura.&lt;ref name="Silva pp. 178–179" /&gt;

== Background ==
Govardhan Hill is considered a sacred site because it is the setting for many legends relating to the life of Lord Krishna, the deity believed to be embodied in the earth of the hill. Krishna and his brother [[Balaram]] are said to have spent many happy hours roaming among its shady groves, pools, caves and lush cow-pastures. An Eden-like sanctuary, the area's waterfalls, garden-grove (''van''), arbour (''nikunj''), water tank (''kund''), and flora are depicted in scenes of Krishna's adventures and raas with [[Radha]].&lt;ref name="Silva pp. 178–179"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kapila D. Silva|author2=Neel Kamal Chapagain|title=Asian Heritage Management: Contexts, Concerns, and Prospects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ofDt_8kyYcC&amp;pg=PA179|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-52054-6|pages=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sites ==

== Legends ==
There are legends of Krishna’s saving the hill from a flood, “dalliances with [[gopi]]s (cow-herdresses)’’ and interactions with demons and gods. Artwork has been created of the Hill represented as a bull and a peacock, Krishna in a cave, the Hill as a mountain of food [[Annakut]], depicted in the floods brought on by [[Indra]], and with the [[Yamuna River]].&lt;ref name="Silva pp. 178–179" /&gt;

===The lifting of Govardhan===

{{Main|Govardhan Puja}}

Govardhan Puja is celebrated on the day after [[Diwali]]. It is the day upon which Lord Krishna defeated Indra, the deity of thunder and rain. As per the story, Krishna saw huge preparations for the annual offering to [[Indra]] and questions his father Nanda about it. He debated with the villagers about what their 'dharma' truly was. They were farmers, they should do their duty and concentrate on farming and protection of their cattle. He continued to say that all human beings should merely do their 'dharma', to the best of their ability and not pray or conduct sacrifices for natural phenomenon. The villagers were convinced by Krishna, and did not proceed with the special puja (prayer). Indra was then angered, and flooded the village. Krishna then lifted Mt Govardhan and held it up as protection to his people and cattle from the rain. Indra finally accepted defeat and recognized Krishna as supreme. This aspect of Krishna's life is mostly glossed over - but it actually set up on the basis of the 'karma' philosophy later detailed in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bhagavadgita.io/chapter/3/?page=1|title=Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3 - Karma Yoga|website=Bhagavad Gita|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ancient Vaishnava legends the Vedic Deva (demigod akin to guardian angel), Indra (god of rain &amp; lightning) was feared by human beings because he would either give the people no rain or flood them if he was not satisfied with their worship. When Krishna found out, he opposed the performance of sacrificial worship for Indra. He emphasized the importance of karma and doing ones duty. This made Indra angry at the boy Krishna (one of the incarnations of the Supreme [[God]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/28/en1 Bhag-P 1.3.28] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123024056/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/28/en1 |date=2013-01-23 }} 'Krishna Is the Source of All Incarnations'.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Indra thus invoked many clouds to appear in the sky and schemed to flood the region with rains lasting for seven days and seven nights. Krishna in reply then lifted Govardhan Hill, under which all the animals and people of the region took shelter, safe from the rains of Indra's fury. Ultimately, Indra accepted defeat. He offered his prayers and left to his heavenly kingdom.

It also represents the downfall of [[Indra]], and a new beginning in Hindu philosophy, from a more sacrificial/ appeasement oriented worship, to a more spiritual plane of thought. This evolution of thought in Hinduism was brought about by [[Krishna]], and therefore he has been the most important Hindu deity since then - considered an 'avatar' of the supreme.

==Recent development==
In 2018, the [[Uttar Pradesh]] Chief Minister [[Yogi Adityanath]] declared Govardhan as a pilgrimage centre (teerth sthal) along with [[Mathura]], [[Baldev]], [[Nandgaon, Uttar Pradesh|Nandgaon]], [[Radhakund]] and [[Gokul]] .&lt;ref&gt;https://m.timesofindia.com/city/agra/five-more-places-declared-as-teerth-sthals-in-mathura/articleshow/63431972.cms&lt;/ref&gt;.Yogi Adityanath Government is also Plan ned to Rejuvenate Govardhan Parvat With Dwapar Yug Flora like [[kadamb]], karoli, tamal, pakkad and tilkan&lt;ref&gt;https://swarajyamag.com/insta/yogi-adityanath-government-plans-to-rejuvenate-govardhan-parvat-with-dwapar-yug-flora&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35312">The tools and means of moving electricity far from where it is generated date back to the late 19th century. They include the movement of electricity in bulk (formally called "[[electric power transmission|transmission]]") and the delivery of electricity to individual customers ("[[electricity distribution|distribution]]"). In the beginning, the two terms were used interchangeably.

==Early transmission==
{{Time-context|section|but lacks specific dates for context|date=November 2014}}
[[File:Carl Saltzmann Erste elektrische Straßenbeleuchtung.jpg|thumb|Berlin, 1884. With double the brilliance of gaslight, arc lamps were in high demand for stores and public areas. Arc lighting circuits used up to thousands of volts with arc lamps connected in [[series and parallel circuits|series]]. ]]
Prior to electricity, various systems have been used for transmission of power across large distances.  Chief among them were telodynamic (cable in motion), pneumatic (pressurized air), and hydraulic (pressurized fluid) transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=14|title=The Electric Motor and the Transmission Power|author=Edwin James Houston|author2=Arthur Edwin Kennelly|publisher=The W. J. Johnston Company|year=1896|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PHAOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cable tram|Cable car]]s were the most frequent example of telodynamic transmission, whose lines could extend for several miles for a single section.  [[History of pneumatic power|Pneumatic transmission]] was used for city power transmission systems in Paris, Birmingham, Rixdorf, Offenbach, Dresden and Buenos Aires at the beginning of the twentieth century.  Cities in the 19th century also used [[Hydraulic drive system|hydraulic transmission]] using high pressure water mains to deliver power to factory motors.  [[London Hydraulic Power Company|London's system]] delivered 7000&amp;nbsp;hp ( 5 [[megawatt]]s) over a {{convert|180|mi|km|adj=on}} network of pipes carrying water at 800 psi.  These systems were replaced by cheaper and more versatile electrical systems, but by the end of the 19th century, city planners and financiers were well aware of the benefits, economics, and process of establishing power transmission systems.

In the early days of electric power usage, widespread [[electric power transmission|transmission of electric power]] had two obstacles. First, devices requiring different voltages required specialized generators with their own separate lines. Street lights, electric motors in factories, power for streetcars and lights in homes are examples of the diversity of devices with voltages requiring separate systems. Secondly, generators had to be relatively near their loads (a mile or less for low voltage devices). It was known that long distance transmission was possible the higher the voltage was raised, so both problems could be solved if transforming voltages could be cheaply performed from a single universal power line.

===Specialized systems===
[[File:Electric tram- Siemens 1884 in Frankfurt.jpg|thumbnail|[[Tram#Electric (trolley cars)|Streetcars]] created enormous demand for early electricity.  This Siemens Tram from 1884 required 500 V direct current, which was typical.]] Much of early electricity was [[direct current]], which could not easily be increased or decreased in voltage either for long-distance transmission or for sharing a common line to be used with multiple types of electric devices.  Companies simply ran different lines for the different classes of loads their inventions required, for example, [[Charles F. Brush|Charles Brush]]'s New York [[Arc lamp#History|arc lamp]] systems required up to 10 kV for many lamps in a series circuit, [[Thomas A. Edison|Edison's]] [[incandescent light]]s used 110 V, [[Tram#Electric (trolley cars)|streetcars]] built by [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Siemens]] or [[Frank J. Sprague|Sprague]] required large motors in the 500 volt range,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ESnBiR7vLPQC&amp;pg=RA4-PA488&amp;lpg=RA4-PA488&amp;dq=tram+volts+siemens |page=488|title=World Railways of the Nineteenth Century|author=Jim Harter|publisher=JHU Press|year=2005|isbn=0-8018-8089-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas industrial motors in factories used still other voltages.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; Due to this specialization of lines, and because transmission was so inefficient, it seemed at the time that the industry would develop into what is now known as a [[distributed generation]] system with large numbers of small generators located near their loads.&lt;ref name=ncep1&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.oe.energy.gov/DocumentsandMedia/primer.pdf |title=Electricity Transmission: A primer|author= National Council on Electricity Policy |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early high voltage exterior lighting===
High voltage was of interest to early researchers working on the problem of transmission over distance.  They knew from elementary electricity principle that the same amount of power could be transferred on a cable by doubling the voltage and halving the current. Due to [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]], they also knew that the capacity of a wire is proportional to the square of the current traveling on it, regardless the voltage, and so by doubling the voltage, the same cable would be capable of transmitting the same amount of power four times the distance.

At the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Exposition of 1878]], electric [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] had been installed along the Avenue de l'Opera and the Place de l'Opera, using electric [[Yablochkov candle|Yablochkov arc lamps]], powered by [[Zénobe Gramme]] alternating current dynamos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/measureforgreatn001419mbp/measureforgreatn001419mbp_djvu.txt|title=A Measure for Greatness: A Short Biography of Edward Weston|author=David Oakes Woodbury|year=1949|publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=83|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electricity at the Columbian Exposition|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lF5KAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3|page=1|author=John Patrick Barrett|accessdate=2009-01-04|publisher=R.

These systems were in direct competition with the dominant [[gas lighting|gaslight]] utilities of the period.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 9-3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2013|title=Switching the Light: From Chemical to Electrical|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=9|issue=3|pages=44–47|doi=10.1109/MIE.2015.2454038|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of investing in a central plant and a network to deliver energy produced to customers who pay a recurring fee for service was familiar business model for investors: it was identical to the lucrative gaslight business, or the hydraulic and pneumatic power transmission systems. The only difference was the commodity being delivered was electricity, not gas, and the "pipes" used for delivering were more flexible.

The [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|California Electric Company]] (now PG&amp;E) in San Francisco in 1879 used two direct current generators from Charles Brush's company to supply multiple customers with power for their arc lamps.  This San Francisco system was the first case of a [[Electric utility|utility]] selling electricity from a central plant to multiple customers via [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] lines.&lt;ref name=kirby&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AVn_Sm56OCoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA357&amp;lpg=RA1-PA357&amp;dq=%22california+electric+light+company%22+1879|title=Engineering in History|author=Richard Shelton Kirby|author2=Frances A.

Grand Rapids Electric Light &amp; Power Company, established in March 1880 by [[William T. Powers (industrialist)|William T. Powers]] and others, began operation of the world’s first commercial central station hydroelectric power plant, Saturday, July 24, 1880, getting power from Wolverine Chair and Furniture Company’s water turbine. It operated a 16-light Brush electric dynamo lighting several storefronts in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/kids/energy.cfm?page=tl_hydropower |title=Energy Timelines Hydropower}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/eere/water/history-hydropower |title=History of Hydropower Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the earliest predecessor of [[Consumers Energy]] of Jackson, Michigan. 

In December 1880, Brush Electric Company set up a central station to supply a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} length of Broadway with arc lighting.  By the end of 1881, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Montreal, Buffalo, San Francisco, Cleveland and other cities had Brush arc lamp systems, producing public light well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=huji&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/brush.html |title=Charles Francis Brush |publisher=[[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] |accessdate=2009-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224192642/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/brush.html |archivedate=2009-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1893 there were 1500 arc lamps illuminating New York streets.&lt;ref name=dennis&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gq9_uNNkmKUC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=%22brush%22+1881+%22new+york%22+%22street+lights%22|title=Cities in Modernity: Representations and Productions of Metropolitan Space, 1840–1930|page=132|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=Richard Dennis|year=2008|isbn=0-521-46470-6|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct current lighting===
Extremely bright arc lights were too bright, and with the high voltages and sparking/fire hazard, too dangerous to use indoors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edisontechcenter.org/ArcLamps.html The First Form of Electric Light History of the Carbon Arc Lamp (1800 – 1980s)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878 inventor [[Thomas Edison]] saw a market for a system that could bring electric lighting directly into a customer's business or home, a niche not served by arc lighting systems.&lt;ref&gt;Howard B. Rockman, Intellectual Property Law for Engineers and Scientists, John Wiley – 2004, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; After devising a commercially viable  [[incandescent light bulb]] in 1879, Edison went on to develop the first large scale investor-owned electric illumination "[[Public utility|utility]]" in lower Manhattan, eventually serving one square mile with 6 "jumbo dynamos" housed at [[Pearl Street Station]].&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guarnieri 9-3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Faruqui, Kelly Eakin, Pricing in Competitive Electricity Markets, Springer Science &amp; Business Media – 2000, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |title=A brief history of Con Edison:"Electricity" |publisher=Coned.com |date=January 1, 1998 |accessdate=December 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030164753/http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When service began in September 1882, there were 85 customers with 400 light bulbs. Each dynamo produced 100&amp;nbsp;kW2—enough for 1200 incandescent lights, and transmission was at 110 V via underground conduits. The system cost $300,000 to build with installation of the {{convert|100000|ft|m}} of underground conduits one of the most expensive parts of the project. Operating expenses exceeded income in the first two years and fire destroyed the plant in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Pearl_Street_Station|title=Pearl Street Station|work=IEEE Global History Network|publisher= [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Edison had a three wire system so that either 110 V or 220 V could be supplied to power some motors.

===Availability of large-scale generation===
Availability of large amounts of power from diverse locations would become possible after [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]]' production of turbogenerators beginning 1889.  Turbogenerator output quickly jumped from 100&amp;nbsp;kW to 25 megawatts in two decades.&lt;ref name=smil&gt;{{cite book|page= 65| title=Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867–1914 and Their Lasting Impact|author= Vaclav Smil|isbn= 0-19-516874-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w3Mh7qQRM-IC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=Transformer+coltman+1988|accessdate=2009-01-03|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to efficient turbogenerators, hydroelectric projects were a significant source of large amounts of power requiring transmission infrastructure.

===Transformers and alternating current===

When [[George Westinghouse]] became interested in electricity, he quickly and correctly concluded that Edison's low voltages were too inefficient to be scaled up for transmission needed for large systems.  He further understood that long-distance transmission needed high voltage and that inexpensive conversion technology only existed for alternating current.  Transformers would play the decisive role in the victory of alternating current over direct current for transmission and distribution systems.&lt;ref name="Coltman"&gt;{{Cite news

In 1881, [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]]  developed a more efficient device which they dubbed the secondary generator, namely an early transformer provided with 1:1 turn ratio and open magnetic circuit.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=maglab&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html|title=Stanley Transformer|publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]; [[University of Florida]]|accessdate=2009-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119134626/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/museum/stanleytransformer.html|archive-date=2009-01-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The first demonstrative long distance (34&amp;nbsp;km, i.e. 21&amp;nbsp;mi) AC line was built for the 1884 International Exhibition of [[Turin, Italy]]. It was powered by a 2-kV, 130-Hz [[Siemens &amp; Halske]] alternator and featured several Gaulard secondary generators with their primary windings connected in series, which fed incandescent lamps. The system proved the feasibility of AC electric power transmission on long distances.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt; After this success, between 1884 and 1885, [[Hungary|Hungarian]] engineers [[Károly Zipernowsky|Zipernowsky]], [[Ottó Bláthy|Bláthy]], and [[Miksa Déri|Déri]] from the [[Ganz company]] in [[Budapest]] created the efficient "Z.B.D." closed-core coils, as well as the modern [[Electric distribution systems|electric distribution system]]. The three had discovered that all former coreless or open-core devices were incapable of regulating voltage, and were therefore impractical. Their joint patent described two versions of a design with no poles: the "closed-core transformer" and the "shell-core transformer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energyhistory.energosolar.com/en_19th_century_electric_history.htm|title=Hungarian Inventors and their Inventions in the Field of Heavy-Current Engineering|publisher=energosolar.com|accessdate=26 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121153709/http://energyhistory.energosolar.com/en_19th_century_electric_history.htm|archivedate=21 January 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/0352105.pdf Patent No. US352105], U.S. Patent Office, 1886-11-02, retrieved 2009-07-08&lt;/ref&gt; Ottó Bláthy suggested the use of closed-cores, Károly Zipernowsky the use of [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt connections]], and Miksa Déri performed the experiments.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smil"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w3Mh7qQRM-IC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=ZBD+transformer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HRDljDzbiz&amp;sig=F-cGB0B8BjL32gIunSIvtSB5hYc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=k7tXSpvIDoT-MPGahJ0I&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 Smil, Vaclav, ''Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867—1914 and Their Lasting Impact''], Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the closed-core transformer the iron core is a closed ring around which the two coils are wound. In the shell type transformer, the windings are passed through the core. In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings travels almost entirely within the iron core, with no intentional path through air. The core consists of iron strands or sheets. These revolutionary design elements would finally make it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces.&lt;ref name="Bláthy_HPO"&gt;[http://www.hpo.hu/English/feltalalok/blathy.html ''Bláthy, Ottó Titusz''], Hungarian Patent Office.&lt;/ref&gt; Zipernowsky, Bláthy and Déri also discovered the transformer formula, Vs/Vp = Ns/Np.{{Citation needed|reason=unsupported by refs|date=July 2009}} Electrical and electronic systems the world over rely on the principles of the original [[Ganz]] transformers.

A very first operative AC line was put into service in 1885 in via dei Cerchi, [[Rome, Italy]], for public lighting. It was powered by two Siemens &amp; Halske alternators rated 30&amp;nbsp;hp (22&amp;nbsp;kW), 2 kV at 120&amp;nbsp;Hz and used 200 series-connected Gaulard 2-kV/20-V step-down transformers provided with a closed magnetic circuit, one for each lamp. Few months later it was followed by the first British AC system, which was put into service at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]], London. It also featured Siemens alternators and 2.4-kV/100-V step-down transformers, one per user, with shunt-connected primaries.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2013|title=The Beginning of Electric Energy Transmission: Part Two|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=7|issue=2|pages=52–59|doi=10.1109/MIE.2013.2256297|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept that is the basis of modern transmission using inexpensive step up and step down transformers was first implemented by Westinghouse, [[William Stanley, Jr.]] and [[Franklin Leonard Pope]] in 1886 in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], resorting also to European technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edisontechcenter.org/GreatBarrington.html http://edisontechcenter.org – Great Barrington 1886 The first practical AC power delivery system]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas P.

This system was developed into the modern 3-phase system by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and [[Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft]] and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]] in Europe, starting in 1889.&lt;ref name=hughes&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g07Q9M4agp4C&amp;pg=PA119|pages=119–122|author=[[Thomas P.

Simple economics would drive the expensive, bulky and mechanically complex DC dynamos to their ultimate extinction. As it turned out, the deciding factor in the [[War of Currents]] was the availability of low cost step up and step down transformers that meant that all customers regardless of their specialized voltage requirements could be served at minimal cost of conversion. This "universal system" is today regarded as one of the most influential innovations for the use of electricity.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

===High voltage direct current transmission===
The case for alternating current was not clear at the turn of the century and high voltage direct current transmission systems were successfully installed without the benefit of transformers.  [[Rene Thury]], who had spent six months at Edison's [[Edison, New Jersey|Menlo Park]] facility, understood his problem with transmission and was convinced that moving electricity over great distances was possible using direct current.  He was familiar with the work of [[Marcel Deprez]], who did early work on high voltage transmission after being inspired by the capability of arc lamp generators to support lights over great distances.&lt;ref name=arrillaga&gt;{{cite book |page=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I2mdgdflTQUC&amp;pg=PA1|title=High Voltage Direct Current Transmission|isbn=978-0-85296-941-0|year=1998|publisher=Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)|author=Jos Arrillaga|accessdate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2013|title=The Alternating Evolution of DC Power Transmission|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=7|issue=3|pages=60–63|doi=10.1109/MIE.2013.2272238|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deprez avoided transformers by placing generators and loads in series&lt;ref name=arrillaga/&gt; as [[arc lamp]] systems of [[Charles F. Brush]] did.  Thury developed this idea into the first commercial system for high-voltage DC transmission.  Like Brush's dynamos, current is kept constant, and when increasing load demands more pressure, voltage is increased. The [[Rene Thury#The Thury system|Thury System]] was successfully used on several DC transmission projects from Hydro generators.  The first in 1885 was a low voltage system in [[Biel/Bienne|Bözingen]],&lt;ref name=esuisse&gt;{{cite web|language=german|url=http://www.electrosuisse.ch/cms.cfm/s_page/74440|accessdate=2009-01-05|title=René Thury|publisher=Electrosuisse, a Swiss organization of Electrotechnical professionals|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914061501/http://www.electrosuisse.ch/cms.cfm/s_page/74440|archivedate=2009-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first high voltage system went into service in 1889 in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], by the ''Acquedotto de Ferrari-Galliera'' company.

===Victory for AC===
Ultimately, the versatility of the Thury system was hampered by the fragility of series distribution, and the lack of a reliable DC conversion technology that would not show up until the 1940s with improvements in [[mercury arc valve]]s.  The AC "universal system" won by force of numbers, proliferating systems with transformers both to couple generators to high-voltage transmission lines, and to connect transmission to local distribution circuits. By a suitable choice of [[utility frequency]], both lighting and motor loads could be served. [[Rotary converter]]s and later [[mercury-arc valve]]s and other rectifier equipment allowed DC load to be served by local conversion where needed. Even generating stations and loads using different frequencies could also be interconnected using rotary converters. By using common generating plants for every type of load, important [[economy of scale|economies of scale]] were achieved, lower overall capital investment was required, [[load factor (electrical)|load factor]] on each plant was increased allowing for higher efficiency, allowing for a lower cost of energy to the consumer and increased overall use of electric power.

By allowing multiple generating plants to be interconnected over a wide area, electricity production cost was reduced. The most efficient available plants could be used to supply the varying loads during the day. Reliability was improved and capital investment cost was reduced, since stand-by generating capacity could be shared over many more customers and a wider geographic area.  Remote and low-cost sources of energy, such as [[hydroelectric]] power or mine-mouth coal, could be exploited to lower energy production cost.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas P. Hughes]], ''Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society 1880–1930'', The Johns Hopkins University Press,Baltimore 1983 {{ISBN|0-8018-2873-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first transmission of three-phase alternating current using high voltage took place in 1891 during the [[International Electro-Technical Exhibition - 1891|international electricity exhibition]] in [[Frankfurt]]. A 15&amp;nbsp;kV transmission line connected [[Lauffen, Baden-Württemberg|Lauffen]] on the [[Neckar]] and Frankfurt am Main, on a 175&amp;nbsp;km long distance.&lt;ref name="guarnieri 7-2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kiessling F, Nefzger P, Nolasco JF, Kaintzyk U (2003) Overhead power lines. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially transmission lines were supported by porcelain pin-and-sleeve [[Electric insulator|insulator]]s similar to those used for [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] and [[telephone]] lines. However, these had a practical limit of 40 kV. In 1907, the invention of the disc insulator by [[Harold W. Buck]] of the [[Niagara Falls Power Corporation]] and [[Edward M. Hewlett]] of [[General Electric]] allowed practical insulators of any length to be constructed for higher voltages.

The first large scale hydroelectric generators in the USA were installed in 1895 at [[Niagara Falls]] and provided electricity to [[Buffalo, New York]], via power transmission lines. A statue of [[Nikola Tesla]] stands at, Goat Island Niagara Falls New York, today in tribute to his contributions.

Voltages of 100 kV and more were not established technology until around 5 years later, with for example the first 110 kV line in Europe between [[Lauchhammer]] and [[Riesa]], [[Germany]], in 1912.

In the early 1920s the [[Pit River]] – [[Cottonwood, California|Cottonwood]] – [[Vaca-Dixon]] line was built for 220 kV transporting power from hydroelectric plants in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], at the same time the [[Big Creek, California|Big Creek]] – [[Los Angeles]] lines were upgraded to the same voltage. Both of those systems entered commercial service in 1923. On April 17, 1929 the first 220 kV line in [[Germany]] was completed, running from [[Brauweiler]] near [[Cologne]], over [[Kelsterbach]] near Frankfurt, [[Rheinau (Baden)|Rheinau]] near [[Mannheim]], [[Ludwigsburg]]–[[Hoheneck]] near [[Austria]]. This line comprises the [[North-South Powerline|North-South interconnect]], at the time one of the world's largest power systems. The masts of this line were designed for eventual upgrade to 380 kV. However the first transmission at 380 kV in Germany was on October 5, 1957 between the substations in [[Rommerskirchen]] and [[Ludwigsburg]]–[[Hoheneck]].

The world's first 380 kV power line was built in [[Sweden]], the 952&amp;nbsp;km [[Harsprånget]] – [[Hallsberg]] line in 1952. In 1965, the first extra-high-voltage transmission at 735 kV took place on a [[Hydro-Québec]] transmission line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Vijay K. |last=Sood |title=IEEE Milestone : 40th Anniversary of 735 kV Transmission System |work=IEEE Canadian Review |date=Spring 2006 |pages=6–7 |url=http://www.ieee.ca/canrev/cr52/CR52_735kv.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the first transmission at 1200 kV was in the [[Soviet Union]].

The rapid industrialization in the 20th century made electrical transmission lines and grids a critical part of the economic infrastructure in most industrialized nations. Interconnection of local generation plants and small distribution networks was greatly spurred by the requirements of [[World War I]], where large electrical generating plants were built by governments to provide power to munitions factories; later these plants were connected to supply civil load through long-distance transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pp. 293–295&lt;/ref&gt;

Small municipal electrical utilities did not necessarily desire to reduce the cost of each unit of electricity sold; to some extent, especially during the period 1880–1890, electrical lighting was considered a luxury product and electric power was not substituted for steam power. Engineers such as [[Samuel Insull]] in the United States and [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti|Sebastian Z. De Ferranti]] in the United Kingdom were instrumental in overcoming technical, economic, regulatory and political difficulties in development of long-distance electric power transmission. By introduction of electric power transmission networks, in the city of London the cost of a kilowatt-hour was reduced to one-third in a ten-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes pp. ?&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 [[Grid (electricity)|electrical networks]] in the United Kingdom began to be interconnected in the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]], initially operating at 132 kV.

[[File:Male impala profile.jpg|thumb|A pair of horns on a male [[impala]]]]
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals A horn.jpg|thumb|Anatomy and physiology of animal's horn]]
A '''horn''' is a permanent pointed projection on the head of various animals consisting of a covering of [[keratin]] and other [[protein]]s surrounding a core of live [[bone]]. Horns are distinct from [[antlers]], which are not permanent. In mammals, true horns are found mainly among the [[ruminant]] [[artiodactyl]]s{{Citation needed lead|date=December 2007}}, in the families [[Antilocapridae]] ([[pronghorn]]) and [[Bovidae]] ([[cattle]], [[goat]]s, [[antelope]] etc.).

One pair of horns is usual; however, two or more pairs occur in a few wild species and [[Domestication|domesticated]] breeds of sheep. [[Polycerate]] (multi-horned) sheep breeds include the [[Hebridean (sheep)|Hebridean]], [[Icelandic sheep|Icelandic]], [[Jacob (sheep)|Jacob]], [[Manx Loaghtan]], and the [[Navajo-Churro sheep|Navajo-Churro]].

Horns usually have a curved or [[spiral]] shape, often with ridges or fluting. In many species only males have horns. Horns start to grow soon after birth, and continue to grow throughout the life of the animal (except in pronghorns, which shed the outer layer annually, but retain the bony core). Partial or deformed horns in livestock are called ''scurs''. Similar growths on other parts of the body are not usually called horns, but [[Spur (zoology)|spur]]s, [[claw]]s or [[hoof]]s depending on the part of the body on which they occur.

==Other hornlike growths==
The term "horn" is also popularly applied to other hard and pointed features attached to the head of animals in various other families:
* [[Giraffidae]]: [[Giraffe]]s have one or more pairs of bony bumps on their heads, called [[ossicone]]s.  These are covered with furred skin.
* [[Cervidae]]: Most [[deer]] have [[antler]]s, which are not true horns.  When fully developed, antlers are dead bone without a horn or skin covering; they are borne only by adults (usually males, except for [[reindeer]]) and are shed and regrown each year.
* [[Rhinocerotidae]]: The [[rhinoceros horn|"horns" of rhinoceroses]] are made of [[keratin]], the same substance as fingernails, and grow continuously, but do not have a bone core.
*[[Chamaeleonidae]]: Many [[chameleons]], most notably the [[Jackson's Chameleon]], possess horns on their skulls, and have a keratin covering.
* [[Ceratopsidae]]: The "horns" of the ''[[Triceratops]]'' were extensions of its skull bones although debate exists over whether they had a keratin covering.
* [[Abelisauridae]]: various abelisaurid theropods, such as ''[[Carnotaurus]]'' and ''[[Majungasaurus]]'' possessed extensions of the [[frontal bone]] which were likely covered in some form of keratinous integument.
* [[Horned lizard]]s (''Phrynosoma''): These lizards have horns on their heads which have a hard keratin covering over a bony core, like mammalian horns.
* Insects: Some insects (such as [[rhinoceros beetle]]s) have horn-like structures on the head or [[thorax]] (or both).  These are pointed outgrowths of the hard [[chitin]]ous [[exoskeleton]].  Some (such as [[stag beetle]]s) have greatly enlarged jaws, also made of chitin.
* [[Canidae]]: [[Golden jackal]]s are known to occasionally develop a [[Jackal's Horn|horny growth]] on the skull, which is associated with magical powers in south-eastern Asia.&lt;ref&gt;''Sketches of the natural history of Ceylon'' by Sir James Emerson Tennent, published by Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts, 1861&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mammals of Nepal: (with reference to those of India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Pakistan)'' by Tej Kumar Shrestha, published by Steven Simpson Books, 1997, {{ISBN|0-9524390-6-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Azendohsauridae]]: the skull of the triassic azendohsaurid [[archosauromorph]] ''[[Shringasaurus]]'' possessed two massive, forward-facing conical horns, which were likely covered in cornified sheaths in life.
* [[Anhimidae]]: The [[horned screamer]] possesses an entirely keratinous spine which is loosely connected to its skull. 

Many mammal species in various families have [[tusk]]s, which often serve the same functions as horns, but are in fact oversized teeth. These include the [[Moschidae]] (Musk deer, which are ruminants), [[Suidae]] ([[Wild Boar]]s), [[Proboscidea]] ([[Elephant]]s), [[Monodontidae]] ([[Narwhal]]s) and [[Odobenidae]] ([[Walrus]]es).
[[Polled livestock|Polled]] animals or ''pollards'' are those of normally-horned (mainly [[domesticated]]) species whose horns have been removed, or which have not grown.  In some cases such animals have small horny growths in the skin where their horns would be – these are known as ''scurs''.

===On humans===
[[Cutaneous horn]]s are the only examples of horns growing on people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrU7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Cutaneous+horns+are+the+only+examples+of+horns+growing+on+people&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGxpm4mbXXAhVS8mMKHSaVDZEQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Cutaneous%20horns%20are%20the%20only%20examples%20of%20horns%20growing%20on%20people&amp;f=false|title=Anatomical Anomalies|last=Alston|first=Isabella|date=2014-08-01|publisher=TAJ Books International|isbn=9781844063789|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are most often benign growths and can be removed by a razor.

Cases of people growing horns have been historically described, sometimes with mythical status.  Researchers have not however discovered photographic evidence of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Tubbs"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tubbs|first=R.

The phenomenon of humans with horns has been observed in countries lacking advanced medicine. There are living people, several in China, with cases of cutaneous horns, most common in the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=DEAD LINK! http://www.stern.de/wissen/mensch/ungewoehnliche-operation-aerzte-befreien-frau-von-horn-1682189.html |title=Bundestagswahl 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509222112/http://www.stern.de/wissen/mensch/ungewoehnliche-operation-aerzte-befreien-frau-von-horn-1682189.html |archivedate=2011-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people, notably [[The Enigma (performer)|The Enigma]], have horn implants; that is, they have implanted silicone beneath the skin as a form of [[body modification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/mar/11/health.lifeandhealth|title=Johann Hari on the bizarre world of radical plastic surgery|first=Hari|last=Johann|publisher=Guardian News and Media | location=London | date=2002-03-11 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The erect penis is sometimes referred to in slang use as a "horn", but it normally contains no keratin. However, a cutaneous horn can grow ''on'' the penis, which may indicate [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="hornpenis"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0190962290703159|title=Cutaneous horn of the penis: Its association with squamous cell carcinoma and HPV-16 infection|doi=10.1016/0190-9622(90)70315-9 | volume=23|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|pages=969–972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal uses of horns==
[[File:Goat skull (MAV FMVZ USP).jpg|thumb|left|Goat skull piece]]
[[File:Serengeti Bueffel2.jpg|thumb|right|[[African buffalo]] (both sexes have horns)]]
Animals have a variety of uses for horns and antlers, including defending themselves from predators and fighting members of their own species (''horn fighting'') for territory, dominance or [[mating]] priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Valerius Geist|author2=Fritz R. Walther|author3=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources|title=The Behaviour of Ungulates and Its Relation to Management: The Papers of an International Symposium Held at the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, 2-5 November 1971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQcpAQAAMAAJ|year=1974|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward O. Wilson|title=Sociobiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9ofvKZAmpEC&amp;pg=PA119|date=1 January 1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-81624-4|pages=119–}})&lt;/ref&gt; Horns are usually present only in males but in some species, females too may possess horns. It has been theorized by researchers that taller species living in the open are more visible from longer distances and more likely to benefit from horns to defend themselves against predators. Female bovids that are not hidden from predators due to their large size or open [[savannah]] like habitat are more likely to bear horns than small or camouflaged species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.physorg.com/news172428997.html|title= Why Female Water Buffalo Have Horns but Impala Do Not? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, horns may be used to root in the soil or strip bark from trees.  In animal [[courtship]] many use horns in displays. For example, the male [[blue wildebeest]] reams the bark and branches of trees to impress the female and lure her into his [[territory (animal)|territory]]. Some animals with true horns use them for cooling. The blood vessels in the bony core allow the horns to function as a [[radiator]].

After the death of a horned animal, the keratin may be consumed by the larvae of the [[Ceratophaga vastella|Horn Moth]].

==Human uses of horns==
[[File:Water buffalo horn 01.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Water buffalo]] horn used as a hammer with cleaver to cut fish in southeast China.]]
*Horned animals are sometimes hunted so their mounted head or horns can be displayed as a [[Trophy hunting|hunting trophy]] or as decorative objects.
*Some cultures use bovid horns as [[musical instrument]]s, for example, the [[shofar]].  These have evolved into [[brass instrument]]s in which, unlike the [[trumpet]], the bore gradually increases in width through most of its length—that is to say, it is [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] rather than [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]].  These are called [[French horn|horn]]s, though now made of [[metal]].
*[[Drinking horn]]s are bovid horns removed from the bone core, cleaned and polished and used as [[drinking vessel]]s. (See also the legend of the ''Horn of plenty'', or ''[[Cornucopia]]''). It has been suggested that the shape of a natural horn was also the model for the [[rhyton]], a horn-shaped drinking vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Chusid, ''Hearing Shofar: The Still Small Voice of the Ram's Horn'', 2009, Chapter 3-6 - Ram's Horn of Passover &lt;http://www.hearingshofar.com&gt;. The book also posits that the ancient Hebrews and neighboring tribes used horns as weapons and as utensils.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Powder horn]]s were originally bovid horns fitted with lids and carrying straps, used to carry [[gunpowder]]. [[Powder flask]]s of any material may be referred to as powder horns.
*[[Shoehorn]]s were originally made from slices of bovid horn, which provided the right curving shape and a smooth surface.
*Antelope horns are used in traditional Chinese medicine.
*Horns consist of [[keratin]], and the term "horn" is used to refer to this material, sometimes including similarly solid keratin from other parts of animals, such as [[hoof]]s.  Horn may be used as a material in tools, [[Horn furniture|furniture]] and decoration, among other uses.  In these applications, horn is valued for its hardness, and it has given rise to the expression ''hard as horn''.  Horn is somewhat [[thermoplastic]] and (like [[Tortoiseshell material|tortoiseshell]]) was formerly used for many purposes where [[plastic]] would now be used.  Horn may be used to make [[glue]].
*[[Composite bow|Horn bows]] are bows made from a combination of horn, [[sinew]] and usually wood. These materials allow more energy to be stored in a short bow than wood alone.
*Horns and horn tips from various animals have been used for centuries in the manufacture of scales, grips, or handles for [[knives]] and other weapons, and beginning in the 19th century, for the handle scales of [[handgun]]s.
*Horn [[Button (clothing)|button]]s may be made from horns, and historically also hooves which are a similar material. The non-bony part of the horn or hoof may be softened by heating to a temperature just above the boiling point of water, then molded in metal dies, or the hollow lower part of the horn may be slit spirally lengthwise and then flattened in a vise between wood boards, again after heating, and later cut with a holesaw or similar tool into round or other shaped blanks which are finished on a lathe or by hand. Toggle buttons are made by cutting off the solid tips of horns and perforating them. Antler buttons, and buttons made from hooves are not technically horn buttons, but are often referred to as such in popular parlance. Horns from cattle, water buffaloes, and sheep are all used for commercial button making, and of other species as well, on a local and non-commercial basis. 
*Horn combs were common in the era before replacement by plastic, and are still made. 
*Horn needle cases and other small boxes, particularly of water buffalo horn, are still made. One occasionally finds horn used as a material in antique snuff boxes. 
*Horn strips for inlaying wood are a traditional technique.
*Carved horn hairpins and other jewelry such as brooches and rings are manufactured, particularly  in Asia, including for the souvenir trade.
*Horn is used in artwork for small, detailed carvings. It is an easily worked and polished material,is strong and durable, and in the right variety, beautiful.
*Horn Chopsticks are found in Asian countries from highland Nepal and Tibet to the Pacific coast. Typically they are not the common material, but rather are higher quality decorative articles. Similarly other horn flatware, notably spoons, continues to be manufactured for decorative and other purposes. 
*Horn [[Long dice]] of a rodlike elongated shape with four numbered faces, and two small unnumbered end faces continue to be manufactured in Asia where they are traditionally used in games like [[Chaupar]] (Pachisi) and many others.
*Horn is sometimes a material found in walking stick and cane handles and shafts. In the latter use, the horn elements may be cut into short cylindrical segments held together by a metal core.

'''Kallakadal''' is [[Malayalam]] word having literal meaning of 'sea thief'. The word kalla kadal, which is used by local fishermen was adopted by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/article3318196.ece | title=Freak phenomenon along the southern coast of India | publisher=The Hindu | date=April 16, 2012 | accessdate=July 7, 2012 | author=T. Nandakumar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically, it refers to phenomenon when the sea water creeps in during good weather like a thief arriving unannounced. Kallakkadal event is considered as one of the major societal problems along the Indian coasts and these are caused by high swell waves, without any sign in the local winds, sometimes cause severe flooding. 

A recent research focused on the causes of [[Kallakkadal/swell surge]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2016JC011723 | title= Tele-connection between the North Indian Ocean high swell events and Meteorological Conditions over the Southern Indian Ocean | author= Remya P G, S Vishnu, B Praveen Kumar, T M Balakrishnan Nair, B Rohith}} &lt;/ref&gt; has established the link between North Indian Ocean high swell events and the meteorological conditions in the Southern Ocean using a combination of ocean wave observations and numerical model simulations. The study confirms that Kallakkadal events are caused by swells propagating from the Southern Indian Ocean of 30°S, from the region between Africa and Australia. Swell waves are generated by distant weather systems, where wind blows for a duration of time over a large fetch.


The long period swell waves (&gt;18 s) seen during Kallakkadal/Swell surge events are generated in the southern Indian ocean by severe low pressure system existed 3-5 days prior to the Kallakkadal events. The quasi-stationary nature of the southern ocean low pressure systems provides strong (~25 ms-1) and long duration (~3 days) surface winds over a large fetch; essential conditions for the generation of long period swells. The intense winds associated with these severe low pressure systems in the Southern Indian Ocean trigger the generation of high waves which propagate to Indian Coastal regions as swells. Furthermore these swells affect coastal areas which are dependent on the local topography, angle of incidence and tidal conditions, cause high wave activity and Kallakkadal along the Indian coastal regions. The study shows that Kallakkadal events along NIO coasts can be effectively monitored and forecasted at least 2 days in advance if the meteorological conditions of the Southern Ocean are properly monitored. INCOIS has been now successfully giving advanced warning to the coastal community about the Kallakkadal events.


==Characteristics of kallakadal==
Characteristics of “Kallakkadal” as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodc.go.jp/info/ioc_doc/Workshop/185249e.pdf | title=Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission | publisher=UNESCO | date=14–17 July 2009 | accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*This phenomenon occurs mostly during pre-monsoon season and sometimes during post monsoon.
*It continues for a few days.
*It inundates the low lying coasts.
*During high tide the run-up, water level can reach as much as 3–4 m above Maximum Water Level (MWL).

The '''Kamchatka Current''' is a cold-water current flowing south-westward from the [[Bering Strait]], along the [[Siberia]]n Pacific coast and the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. A portion of this current then becomes the [[Oyashio Current]] while the remainder joins the warmer [[North Pacific Current]].

'''Khun Borom''' ({{lang-th|ขุนบรม}}, {{IPA-th|kʰǔn bɔːrom}}) or '''Khoun Bourôm''' ({{lang-lo|ຂຸນບູຣົມ}}, {{IPA-lo|kʰǔn bǔːróm}}) is a legendary progenitor of the [[Tai peoples|Tai]]-speaking peoples, considered by the [[Lao people|Lao]]{{ciation needed|date=December 2013}} to be the father of their race.

==Mythology==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
According to the myth of Khoun Borôm,{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} a myth commonly related among Tai-speaking peoples,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} in ancient times people were wicked and crude.  A great deity destroyed them with a flood, leaving only three worthy chiefs who were preserved in [[heaven]] to be the founders and guides for a new race of people.  The deity sent the three chiefs back to the earth with a [[Bubalus|buffalo]] to help them till the land.

The chiefs and the buffalo arrived in the legendary land of [[Muang Thèn]], located at today's [[Điện Biên Phủ]], Vietnam. Once the land had been prepared for [[Rice#History of domestication and cultivation|rice cultivation]], the buffalo died and a [[Momordica charantia|bitter gourd]] vine grew from his nostril. From the gourds on the vine, the new human race emerged. Relatively dark-skinned aboriginal peoples emerging from gourds cut open with a hot skewer and the lighter skinned Tai peoples emerging from cuts made with a chisel.

The gods then taught the Tai peoples how to build houses and cultivate rice. They were instructed in proper rituals and behavior, and grew prosperous.  As their population grew, they needed aid in governing their relations and resolving disputes. Phagna Thèn, the king of the gods, sent his son, Khoun Borôm, to be the ruler of the Tai people. Khoun Borôm ruled the Tai people for 25 years, teaching them to use new tools and other arts.

After this quarter-century span, Khoun Borôm divided the kingdom among his seven sons, giving each one of them a portion of the kingdom to rule.

==Alleged association with Nanzhao==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
Khoun Borôm is sometimes erroneously identified, apparently without any evidence at all, as having been [[Piluoge]], a historical ruler of the [[Nanzhao]] (Ai Lao) Empire.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} It is claimed that this Khoun Borôm, ruler of Nanzhao, had nine sons, and seven of them became kings in different kingdoms in "Lèmthong":

# "[[Khun Lo|Khoun Lo]]" ruled [[Muang Sua]] (Xoua), ([[Luang Phrabang]], Laos) 
# "Khoun Phalan" ruled [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture|Muang Sipsong Phanna]], (Yunnan, China)
# "Khoun Chulông" ruled Muang KôtThèPhènpôm, (Muang [[Houaphanh]] to Tonkin, Vietnam) 
# "Khoun Khamphông" ruled [[Singhanavati|Muang Yônôk Lanna]] (Thailand)
# "Khoun In" ruled [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Muang Sri Ayôthaya]], (Thailand)

# "Khoun Chuang" ruled [[Muang Phuan]], ([[Xiangkhouang Province|Xieng Khouang]], Laos).

There were 19 kings after Khoun Lo who ruled Muang Swa. The last one was Khoun Vang, who was then succeeded by:

* Lang, who became King Langthirath
* Thao Khamphong, crowned as King Souvanna Khamphong
* Chao Fifah, also known as Khamhiao, who had six sons
* [[Fa Ngum|Chao Fa Ngum]], who founded the [[Lan Xang]] Kingdom during the 14th century.

Both King [[Mangrai]] of Chiang Mai and [[Uthong]] of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] are said to have been descendants of Khum Borom's younger sons.

==Interpretation==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
Some interpreters{{who|date=December 2013}} of the story of Khoun Borôm believe that it describes Tai-speaking peoples arriving in Southeast Asia from China (mythically identified with heaven, from which the Tai chiefs emerge after the flood). The system of dividing and expanding a kingdom in order to provide for the sons of a ruler agrees in general with the apparent organization and succession practices of ancient Tai village groups was called ''[[mueang]]''.

Scholar [[David K. Wyatt]] believes{{citation-needed|date=February 2016}} that the Khoun Borôm myth may provide insight into the early history of the Tai people in Southeast Asia.  Versions of the Khoun Borôm myth occur as early as 698 CE in Xiang Khouang, and identify Tai-speaking kingdoms that would be formally established years later. This may indicate the early geographical spread of Tai-speaking peoples, and provides a mythological explanation for why modern Tai-speaking peoples are found in such widespread pockets.

Linguistic analysis{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} indicates that the division of the early Tai speakers into the language groups that gave rise to modern [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Lao language|Lao]] and other languages occurred sometime between the 7th and 11th centuries CE.  This split proceeded along geographic lines very similar{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} to the division given in the Khoun Borôm legend.

There have been 114 [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane or tropical storms]] that affected the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]].&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10&amp;nbsp;years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.&lt;ref name="Buchholz et al."&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchholz|first=Margaret|author2=Larry Savadove |year=1993|title=Great Storms of the Jersey Shore|publisher=Down the Shore Publishing|isbn=0-945582-51-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Jersey has seen the remnants of several once-powerful hurricanes, some resulting in heavy damage. Nine storms dropped over {{convert|10|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall in the state, including a hurricane in 1940 that interacted with a [[cold front]] and dropped {{convert|24|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall in [[Ewan, New Jersey|Ewan]]. Numerous hurricanes that remained offshore have each drowned small numbers of swimmers.

==List of tropical cyclones==
Most of the following are tropical cyclones that passed through the state after weakening from their peak.

===Pre–1900===
In the 19th century, two hurricanes struck the coastline, each in 1804 and in 1821; both caused minor damage. The most significant storm of the century was the [[Gale of 1878]], which produced hurricane-force winds across western [[New Jersey]]. The hurricane caused severe damage and 11&amp;nbsp;deaths.

===1900–1949===
Hurricane activity was above average during this time period. A [[1903 Vagabond Hurricane|hurricane in 1903]] hit near [[Atlantic City]], causing heavy damage near the shore. The most severe hurricane in the time period was the [[1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane]]. Though it did not make landfall, it brought strong winds and waves to the coastline, destroying hundreds of homes.

Dubbed by the Atlantic City Press as the ''Vagabond hurricane'', the storm gathered media interest from Philadelphia and New York, with one newspaper offering $200,000 (1903&amp;nbsp;USD) to aid the survivors. When the reporters arrived at the coast, they are disappointed at the lack of damage, which was confined to loose boards along the boardwalk. The storm's strong surf destroyed several boats along the coastline, including 34 in [[Waretown, New Jersey|Waretown]].&lt;ref name="Buchholz et al."/&gt;

*August 27–28, 2011&amp;nbsp;– [[Hurricane Irene|Tropical Storm Irene]] made landfall in [[Brigantine, New Jersey|Brigantine]] as a strong tropical storm. The storm caused beach erosion, flooding, and sustained winds of 59&amp;nbsp;mph (94&amp;nbsp;km/h) in Cape May, where hurricane-force gusts were also recorded.&lt;ref name=nhc&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical Cyclone Report - Hurricane Irene|url={{NHC TCR url|id=AL092011_Irene}} |agency=[[National Hurricane Center]] |work= |date=December 14, 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous reports of major flooding, downed trees, and power outages were reported.  The storm caused just the third ever shutdown of Atlantic City casinos and also prompted residents of coastal communities to evacuate in advance of the storm. The storm kills a total of ten people in the state.
*September 7–9, 2011&amp;nbsp;– The remnants of [[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]] causes heavy rain across all of the state. In Phillipsburg, 9.55 Inches of rain fell. Moderate to severe flooding occurred in Western portions of the state. 
*October 29–30, 2012&amp;nbsp;– [[Hurricane Sandy]] reaches within 50 miles of the coastline before moving ashore in Brigantine as an extratropical cyclone. The storm brings hurricane-force winds, record low pressure, and a momentous storm surge along areas of the coast. The storm becomes the worst hurricane to affect the state on record, killing 37 and causing nearly $30 billion in damages. Widespread devastation is noted, particularly on [[Long Beach Island]] and the [[Barnegat Peninsula]], where the [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey|Seaside Heights]] boardwalk collapses into the ocean. Further north, storm surge flooding causes massive destruction along the [[Raritan Bay]] and traps thousands in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]]. All of [[New Jersey Transit]]'s [[commuter rail]] operations are affected, with some lines out of service for over a month, and inundation of rolling stock stored in NJ Transit's [[New Jersey Meadowlands|Meadowlands]] yard. Sandy also causes the worst power outage in state history, blacking out over 2 million households.
*June 7, 2013&amp;nbsp;– [[Tropical Storm Andrea (2013)|Tropical Storm Andrea]] passes through New Jersey as a post-tropical storm, causing heavy rainfall throughout the state and forcing an emergency plane landing at [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]]. Rainfall peaks at 5 inches in [[Oceanport, New Jersey|Oceanport]].
*October 6, 2013&amp;nbsp;– Moisture associated with the remnants of [[Tropical Storm Karen (2013)|Tropical Storm Karen]] drops locally heavy rains across New Jersey, causing minor street flooding.
*July 4, 2014&amp;nbsp;– [[Hurricane Arthur (2014)|Hurricane Arthur]] passes to the east of New Jersey. The storm produces moderate rainfall along the coast, though winds remain generally below tropical storm force. Strong waves buffet the coastline, and some [[Independence Day (United States)|holiday]] celebrations in the state were cancelled or postponed.
*August 28, 2014&amp;nbsp;– [[2014 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Cristobal|Hurricane Cristobal]] passes well offshore of the state but generates strong waves and rip currents that kill 2 in [[Sandy Hook]].
*June 21, 2015&amp;nbsp;– The remnants of [[Tropical Storm Bill (2015)|Tropical Storm Bill]] pass through the state, dropping heavy rain but causing no damage.
*October 1, 2015&amp;nbsp;– [[Hurricane Joaquin (2015)|Hurricane Joaquin]] briefly threatens to approach or strike New Jersey, forcing the state to begin storm preparations. Officials in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] discuss the possibility of evacuations, though an order never materializes. Joaquin instead turns away long before affecting the shoreline.
*October 28, 2015&amp;nbsp;– The remnants of [[Hurricane Patricia (2015)|Hurricane Patricia]] pass through the Northeast. Inches of heavy rain and gusty winds cause downed tree limbs, power outages, and flooding throughout the state.
*September 5, 2016&amp;nbsp;– [[Hurricane Hermine]] meanders off the coast as a powerful post-tropical cyclone. The state thoroughly prepares for the storm's arrival during the busy [[Labor Day|holiday]] weekend. Hermine moves further east than forecasted and impacts are much less than expected. Strong waves and minor coastal flooding occur along the coastline.
*October 8, 2016&amp;nbsp;– [[Hurricane Matthew]] interacts with a frontal system, bringing light rain to the state.
*June 24, 2017&amp;nbsp;– The remnants of [[Tropical Storm Cindy (2017)|Tropical Storm Cindy]] bought strong winds to portions of New Jersey. Numerous powerlines and trees were downed in parts of southern and central parts of New Jersey. Two EF-0 tornadoes related to the system touched down in [[Howell Township, New Jersey|Howell Township]], the first one touching down in the Fort Plains area damaging a Home Depot, Chase Bank, a strip mall, an ice cream parlor and downing trees and powerlines. The second one hit a park in the Oak Glen area.
*September 3, 2017&amp;nbsp;– The remnants of [[Hurricane Harvey]] hit New Jersey on Labor Day weekend, causing minimal damage.
*September 19, 2017&amp;nbsp;– Large waves from [[Hurricane Jose (2017)|Hurricane Jose]] cause beach erosion along the [[Jersey Shore]]. Moderate rainfall and winds of 25-40&amp;nbsp;mph also occur across the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pradelli|first=Chad|title=Hurricane Jose sends waves crashing over sea wall|publisher=WPVI-TV|location=Philadelphia, PA|date=September 19, 2017|url=http://6abc.com/weather/hurricane-jose-sends-waves-crashing-over-sea-wall/2434204/|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*September 8–10, 2018&amp;nbsp;– The remnants of [[Tropical Storm Gordon (2018)]] affect the state for 3 days, dropping amounts of up to 3-6 inches in parts of the state, along with wind gusts reaching up to 40&amp;nbsp;mph.

==Listed by month==
Tropical cyclones affect New Jersey the most during the month of September, though the state has experienced tropical cyclones throughout the hurricane season, excluding November. Storms affect the state most in September due to peak warmth in water temperatures. No recorded storm has affected the state between November and May.&lt;ref name="Buchholz et al."/&gt;

On 10 March 2010, Scotland's Marine Bill received Royal Assent, making it the [https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20100416214757/http://www.oqps.gov.uk/legislation/acts/acts2010/pdf/asp_20100005_en.pdf Marine (Scotland) Act 2010].

The Marine (Scotland) Act is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] which provides a framework which will help balance competing demands on [[Scotland's seas]]. It introduces a duty to protect and enhance the [[marine environment]] and includes measures to help boost economic investment and growth in areas such as [[marine renewables]].

The main measures include:

*[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/marine/seamanagement/marineact/marineplanning Marine planning]: a new statutory marine planning system to sustainably manage the increasing, and often conflicting, demands on our seas
*[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/marine/seamanagement/marineact/marinelicensing Marine licensing]: a simpler licensing system, minimising the number of licences required for development in the marine environment to cut bureaucracy and encourage economic investment
*[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/marine/seamanagement/marineact/marineconservation Marine conservation]: improved marine nature and historic conservation with new powers to protect and manage areas of importance for marine wildlife, habitats and historic monuments
* [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/marine/seamanagement/marineact/SealsSeal conservation]: much improved protection for seals and a new comprehensive licence system to ensure appropriate management when necessary
*[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/marine/seamanagement/marineact/marineenforcement Enforcement]: a range of enhanced powers of marine conservation and licensing

==Stakeholders==

[[Wildlife]] organisations, such as the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]], welcomed the new laws.

The '''Ministry of Economy and Energy''' ({{lang-bg|Министерство на икономиката и енергетиката}}, ''Ministerstvo na ikonomikata i energetikata'') of [[Bulgaria]] is the [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] charged with regulating the [[economy]] and [[energy policy]] of the country. The Ministry of Economy was founded in December 1999 through the merger of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism. In August 2005 was formed the current Ministry of Economy and Energy through the merger of the former Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Energy and Energy Resources.

In August 2005, the Minister of Economy and Energy was [[Rumen Ovcharov]] of the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]], with Deputy Ministers Lachezar Borisov, Valentin Ivanov, Yordan Dimov, Nina Radeva, Korneliya Ninova, Galina Tosheva and Anna Yaneva.

In March 2012, the Minister of Economy, Energy, and Tourism switched to [[Delyan Dobrev]].

The '''Ministry of Power'''  is an [[Government of India|Indian government]] [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]]. The current Union Minister of State (Independent charge) is [[R.K. Singh]].
The ministry is charged with overseeing [[Electricity in India|electricity]] production and infrastructure development, including generation, transmission, and delivery, as well as maintenance projects. India faces challenges in electrical supply and delivery, and is often unable to meet demand, even in very large cities.

The ministry acts as a liaison between the central government and [[States and territories of India|state]] electricity operations, as well as with the [[private sector]]. The ministry also oversees [[rural electrification]] projects.

The Ministry of Power became a ministry on July 2, 1992 during the [[P. V. Narasimha Rao government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://powermin.nic.in/ministry_of_power/about_ministry.htm|title=About ministry|publisher=Ministry of Power (India)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026071422/http://www.powermin.nic.in/ministry_of_power/about_ministry.htm|archivedate=26 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that time it had been a department (the Department of Power) in the Ministry of Power, Coal and Non-Conventional Energy Sources. That ministry was split into the Ministry of Power, [[Ministry of Coal]], and Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources (renamed the [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy]] in 2006).

In 2012, the Ministry of Power inaugurated the ''Smart Grid'' project in [[Puducherry]].&lt;ref name="smartgrid"&gt;{{cite news|title=Smart grid project inaugurated|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/smart-grid-project-inaugurated/article4015596.ece|date=2012-10-20|agency=[[The Hindu]]|location=Puducherry|accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Multi-Application Survivable Tether''' ('''MAST''') experiment was an [[outer space|in-space]] investigation designed to use [[CubeSat]] spacecraft connected by [[Tether satellite|tethers]] to better understand the survivability of tethers in space.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;Robert Hoyt, Jeffrey Slostad, and Robert Twiggs, "[http://www.tethers.com/papers/MASTJPC2003Paper.pdf The Multi-application Survivable Tether (MAST) Experiment]," paper AIAA-2003-5219 presented at the 39th AIAAA/SME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, Huntsville AL, July  2003&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched as a secondary payload on a [[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr rocket]] on 17 April 2007 into a 98°, 647 x 782&amp;nbsp;km orbit.  The MAST payload incorporated three picosatellites, named "Ralph," "Ted," and "Gadget,"  which were intended to separate and deploy a {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} tether. The experiment hardware was designed under a NASA Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) collaboration between Tethers Unlimited, Inc. (TUI) and Stanford University, with TUI developing the tether, tether deployer, tether inspection subsystem, satellite avionics, and software, and Stanford students developing the satellite structures and assisting with the avionics design.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment is currently on-orbit.{{update after|2011|02|04}} After launch, as of 25 April 2007, TUI had made contact with the "Gadget" picosatellite, but not with "Ted", the tether-deployer picosatellite, or "Ralph," the end mass.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.tethers.com/MAST_Blog.html | title = MAST Blog | publisher = Tethers Unlimited | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071008083138/http://www.tethers.com/MAST_Blog.html | archivedate = 8 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Satellites ==
The MAST experiment consists of three [[CubeSats]] (3U) launched together as a stack.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; The entire stack was about the size of a loaf of bread.&lt;ref name= "young"&gt;Kelly Young, "[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11716-no-signal-yet-heard-from-tetherdeploying-satellite.html No signal yet heard from tether-deploying satellite]," ''New Scientist,'' 25 April 2007 (accessed 16 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
; Gadget
The middle satellite in the stack, called "Gadget", is the tether inspector. Gadget was designed to slowly crawl up and down the tether after deployment, acquiring images as it moves.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; As of 9 May 2007, the MAST team has downloaded over 1 MB of data from Gadget. Gadget's GPS receiver has acquired an almanac from the GPS satellites, but apparently has not yet achieved a trajectory solution.{{update after|2011|02|04}}
; Ted
"Ted", the tether deployer satellite, is at one end of the stack. Researchers were unable to establish contact with Ted,&lt;ref name= "young" /&gt; and remain uncertain of its status.
; Ralph
"Ralph" is at the other end of the stack, and is described as simply a "tether endmass". Its design did include a radio, but the groundstation has not received any signals from Ralph.  They think Ralph's battery charge has dropped below the level needed to sustain radio operation.&lt;ref name= "klofas" /&gt;

==Deployment==
The experimenter team made contact with the "Gadget" picosatellite, but not with "Ted", the tether-deployer pico satellite, because the Ted pico satellite was powered only by a primary battery, which had depleted by the time the team gained access to the ground station.&lt;ref name= "young" /&gt;  While the system was designed so that the satellites would separate even if communications were not established to the tether deployer, the system did not fully deploy. Radar measurements show the tether initially deployed just 1 meter,&lt;ref name= "klofas"&gt;Bryan Klofas, Jason Anderson, and Kyle Leveque, "[http://www.klofas.com/papers/CommSurvey-Bryan_Klofas.pdf A Survey of Cubesat Communications Systems], November 2008 (accessed 16 February 2012).  Analysis of flight data indicated that over a period of a week, an additional 5-10 meters of tether deployed.  The short deployment was traced to a failure of the separation mechanism to eject the "Ted" pico satellite at full velocity. Presented at the CubeSat Developers Conference, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 10 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Hoyt, N. Voronka, T. Newton, I. Barnes, J. Shepherd, S. Frank, and J. Slostad, “Early Results of the Multi-Application Survivable Tether (MAST) Space Tether Experiment,” ''Proceedings of the 21st AIAA/USU [[Small Satellite Conference|Conference on Small Satellites]]'', SCC07-VII-8, August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission experienced communications challenges due to limited availability of the ground station, which resulted in the team establishing contact with only one of the three pico satellites.  The team operated the "Gadget" pico satellite for nearly two months before terminating the experiment.

== Sustainability ==
Nyatoh is generally perceived as a [[sustainability|sustainable resource]]. However, several species within the related [[genera]] of ''Palaquium'' and ''Payena'', and some ''Palaquium'' species, are on the [[IUCN Red List]] due to [[overexploitation]] and alarming reductions in their [[habitat]]s.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Plouto''' or '''Pluto''' (Πλουτώ "Wealth") was, according to the late 8th&amp;ndash;early 7th century BC [[Greek people|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]], and the probably nearly as old ''[[Homeric Hymn]] 2 to [[Demeter]]'', one of the many [[Oceanid]] daughters of [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+337 337&amp;#x2013;355]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Homeric Hymn]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0013.tlg002.perseus-eng1:1-39 2.5], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0013.tlg002.perseus-eng1:398-448 2.418&amp;#x2013;423].&lt;/ref&gt; Hesiod calls her "soft eyed", and the ''Homeric Hymn'' has her as one of the "deep-bosomed daughters of Oceanus" who were the playmates of [[Persephone]] when she was abducted by [[Hades]]. She may be the same with another [[Plouto (mother of Tantalus)|Pluto]], the mother of [[Tantalus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]]. ''[[The Greek Myths]], section 108 (1960)''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Nature Park "Podilski Tovtry"''' ({{lang-uk|Націона́льний приро́дний парк «Поді́льські То́втри»}}) is a national park, located in the [[Horodok Raion, Khmelnytskyi Oblast|Horodok]], [[Kamianets-Podilskyi Raion|Kamianets-Podilskyi]], and the [[Chemerivtsi Raion]]s ([[raion|districts]]) of [[Khmelnytskyi Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]) in southern region of the [[western Ukraine]]. It is the biggest nature conservation area in Ukraine.

The [[National Park|National Environmental Park]] "Podilski Tovtry" was created on the decree #476/96 of the [[President of Ukraine]], then [[Leonid Kuchma]], on July 27, 1996, in order to maintain and protect the natural landscape of the [[Podillia]] region. The park is a nature-conservational, recreational, culturally enlightening, and scientifically researching institution of national importance. According to the [[Law of Ukraine]] of September 21, 2000 #1989-III, the National nature park "Podilski Tovtry" belongs to the National Ecological Network of Ukraine of the Podillya region ([[Podillya]]).

==General overview==
[[File:National Environmental Park Podilski Tovtry.gif|Park logo|100px|left|thumb]]
The park's area covers 2,613.16&amp;nbsp;km² (645,725.9 acre). There are 1,700 different types of [[flora]], 60 of which are included in the [[Red Book of Ukraine]]. Also there are 217 different types of [[fauna]], 29 of which are included in the [[Red Book of Ukraine]] as well. In total there are 127 objects of nature conservation which contain about 3,000 different types, forms, and sorts of plants.

The park is divided into several functional zones: sacred zone, regulated recreation zone, stationary recreation zone, and managed zone. In those zones are located 21 stationary recreation institutions (such as sanatoriums, profilactoriums, tourist resorts, [[holiday home]]s, etc.), some 160 industrial companies, collective and individual farming that cause harm to nature. Therefore, the main goal of the National nature park is the preservation of natural diversity, creation of the organized zones of recreation and wellness.

The parks natural borders serve [[Zbruch River]] to the west (south from the Sataniv town), [[Dniester]] to the south towards the mouth of [[Ushytsia River]], administrative borders of the [[Novo Ushytsia Raion|Novo Ushytsia]] and [[Dunaivtsi Raion]]s to the east, the Dymytrov, Ordzhonikidze, Vatutin collective farms (Horodok Raion) to the north.

The park includes some 14% of state forest fund, over 13% of collective farm forests, and other territories of region. The total forest fund of the park accounts for some {{convert|3015|ha|acre}}.

In [[electrical engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]], the '''power rating''' of equipment is the highest [[power (physics)|power]] input allowed to flow through particular equipment.  According to the particular discipline, the term "power" may refer to the electrical or mechanical power.  A power rating can also involve average and maximum power, which may vary depending on the kind of equipment and its application.

Power rating limits are usually set as a guideline by the manufacturers, protecting the equipment and simplifying the design of larger systems, by providing a level of operation under which the equipment will not be damaged while allowing for a certain safety margin.

== Equipment types ==

=== Dissipative equipment ===
In equipment which primarily dissipate [[electric power]] or convert it into mechanical power, such as [[resistor]]s, and [[Loudspeaker|speaker]]s, the power rating given is usually the maximum power that can be safely [[dissipation|dissipated]] by the equipment.  The usual reason for this limit is [[heat]], although in certain [[electromechanical]] devices, particularly speakers, it is to prevent mechanical damage.  When heat is the limiting factor, the power rating is easily calculated.  First, the amount of heat that can be safely dissipated by the device, &lt;math&gt;P_{D,max}&lt;/math&gt;, must be calculated.  This is related to the maximum safe operating [[temperature]], the ambient temperature or temperature range in which the device will be operated, and the method of [[Thermal management of electronic devices and systems|cooling]].  If &lt;math&gt;T_{D,max}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum safe [[operating temperature]] of the device, &lt;math&gt;T_{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the ambient temperature, and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{DA}&lt;/math&gt; is the total [[thermal resistance]] between the device and ambient, then the maximum heat dissipation is given by
:&lt;math&gt;P_{D,max} = \frac{T_{D,max} - T_{A}}{\theta_{DA}}&lt;/math&gt;
If all power in a device is dissipated as heat, then this is also the power rating.

=== Mechanical equipment ===
Equipment is generally rated by the power they will deliver, for example, at the shaft of an electric or hydraulic motor.  The power input to the equipment will be greater owing to the less than 100% efficiency of the device.&lt;ref name="AtkinsAtkins2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony G. Atkins|author2=Tony Atkins|author3=Marcel Escudier|title=A Dictionary of Mechanical Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0TjtKmSIL48C&amp;pg=PA269|year=2013|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-958743-4|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thumann2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert Thumann|title=Plant Engineers and Managers Guide to Energy Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7xO-d6gLUgC&amp;pg=PA320|year=2010|publisher=The Fairmont Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88173-657-1|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eccles2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=William J. Eccles|title=Pragmatic Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWntzQ4vY3kC&amp;pg=PA74|year=2008|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers|isbn=978-1-59829-798-0|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency of a device is often defined as the ratio of output power to the sum of output power and losses. In some types of equipment it is possible to measure or calculate losses directly. This allows efficiency to be calculated with greater precision than the quotient of input power over output power, where relatively small measurement uncertainty will greatly affect the resulting calculated efficiency.

=== Power converting equipment===
In devices that primarily [[Power converter|convert]] between different forms of electric power, such as [[transformer]]s, or transport it from one location to another, such as [[transmission line]]s, the power rating almost always refers to the maximum power flow through the device, not dissipation within it. The usual reason for the limit is heat, and the maximum heat dissipation is calculated as above.

Power ratings are usually given in [[watt]]s for [[real power]] and [[volt-ampere]]s for [[apparent power]], although for devices intended for use in large power systems, both may be given in a [[per-unit system]]. Cables are usually rated by giving their maximum voltage and their [[ampacity]].&lt;ref name="Patel2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mukund R. Patel|title=Introduction to Electrical Power and Power Electronics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Am5CI32itwAC&amp;pg=PA54|year=2012|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=978-1-4665-5660-7|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the power rating depends on the method of cooling, different ratings may be specified for air cooling, water cooling, etc.&lt;ref name="Patel2012"/&gt;

== Average vs. maximum ==
For AC-operated devices (e.g. [[coaxial cable]], [[loudspeakers]]), there may be even be two power ratings, a maximum (peak) power rating and an average power rating.&lt;ref name="Whitaker2005"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jerry C. Whitaker|title=The Electronics Handbook, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FdSQSAC3_EwC&amp;pg=PA314|year=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-3666-4|pages=314–315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1989"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary Davis|author2=Ralph Johnes|title=The Sound Reinforcement Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&amp;pg=PA232|year=1989|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|isbn=978-1-61774-545-4|page=232|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; For such devices, the peak power rating usually specifies the low frequency or pulse energy, while the average power rating limits high-frequency operation.&lt;ref name="Whitaker2005"/&gt; Average power calculation rating depends on some assumptions how the device is going to be used. For example, the [[Electronic Industries Association|EIA]] rating method for loudspeakers uses a shaped noise signal that simulates music and allows peak excursion of 6&amp;nbsp;dB, so an EIA rating of 50 Watts corresponds to 200 Watts peak rating.&lt;ref name="Davis1989"/&gt;

== Maximum continuous rating ==
''Maximum continuous rating (MCR)'' is defined as the maximum output (MW) that an electric power generating station is capable of producing continuously under normal conditions over a year. Under ideal conditions, the actual output could be higher than the MCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieso.ca/imoweb/marketdata/genDisclosure.asp|title=IESO|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903020047/http://ieso.ca/imoweb/marketdata/genDisclosure.asp|archivedate=2013-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[shipping]], ships usually operates at the [[nominal continuous rating]] (NCR) which is 85% of the 90% of MCR. The 90% MCR is usually the contractual output for which the propeller is designed. Thus, the usual output at which ships are operated is around 75% to 77% of MCR.&lt;ref&gt;Danish proposal to a design CO2 index for new ships to the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) from the [http://www.dma.dk/sw22623.asp Danish Maritime Authority]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other definitions ==
In some fields of engineering, even a more complex set of power ratings is used. For example, [[Helicopter#Engines|helicopter engines]] are rated for continuous power (which does not have a time constraint), takeoff and hover power rating (defined as half to one hour operation), maximum contingency power (which can be sustained for two-three minutes), and emergency (half a minute) power rating.&lt;ref name="SeddonNewman2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John M. Seddon|author2=Simon Newman|title=Basic Helicopter Aerodynamics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUN75AXYhFgC&amp;pg=PA231|year=2011|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-1-119-97272-3|page=231|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|SERVICE-FACTOR}}
For electrical motors, a similar kind of information is conveyed by the ''service factor'', which is a multiplier that, when applied to the rated output power, gives the power level a motor can sustain for shorter periods of time. The service factor is typically in the 1.15-1.4 range, with the figure being lower for higher-power motors. For every hour of operation at the service-factor-adjusted power rating, a motor loses two to three hours of life at nominal power, i.e. its [[service life]] is reduced to less than half for continued operation at this level.&lt;ref name="Patel2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PE2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael R. Lindeburg, PE|title=Mechanical Engineering Reference Manual for the PE Exam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4P6jjodswwAC&amp;pg=SA72-PA13|year=2013|publisher=www.ppi2pass.com|isbn=978-1-59126-414-9|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service factor is defined in the [[ANSI]]/NEMA [[MG 1]] standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nema.org/Standards/ComplimentaryDocuments/Contents%20and%20Forward%20MG%201.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222101016/http://www.nema.org/Standards/ComplimentaryDocuments/Contents%20and%20Forward%20MG%201.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is generally used in the United States.&lt;ref name="ToliyatKliman2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hamid A.

Exceeding the power rating of a device by more than the margin of safety set by the manufacturer usually does damage to the device by causing its operating temperature to exceed safe levels.  In [[semiconductor]]s, irreparable damage can occur very quickly.  Exceeding the power rating of most devices for a very short period of time is not harmful, although doing so regularly can sometimes cause cumulative damage.

Power ratings for electrical apparatus and transmission lines are a function of the duration of the proposed load and the ambient temperature; a transmission line or transformer, for example, can carry significantly more load in cold weather than in hot weather. Momentary overloads, causing high temperatures and deterioration of insulation, may be considered an acceptable trade-off in emergency situations. The power rating of switching devices varies depending on the circuit voltage as well as the current. In certain aerospace or military applications, a device may carry a much higher rating than would be accepted in devices intended to operate for long service life.

== Examples ==

=== Audio amplifiers ===
{{Main|Audio power}}[[Audio amplifier]] power ratings are typically established by driving the device under test to the onset of [[Clipping (audio)|clipping]], to a predetermined distortion level, variable per manufacturer or per product line. Driving an amplifier to 1% distortion levels will yield a higher rating than driving it to 0.01% distortion levels.&lt;ref name="Quilter"&gt;Quilter, Patrick (2004). [http://soundandsong.com/Issue004/004_PowerAmpRatings.html "How to Compare Amplifier Power Ratings."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111024636/http://www.soundandsong.com/Issue004/004_PowerAmpRatings.html |date=2010-01-11 }} ''Sound and Song''. Retrieveded on March 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, testing an amplifier at a single mid-range frequency, or testing just one channel of a two-channel amplifier, will yield a higher rating than if it is tested throughout its intended frequency range with both channels working. Manufacturers can use these methods to market amplifiers whose published maximum power output includes some amount of clipping in order to show higher numbers.&lt;ref name="Quilter" /&gt;

For instance, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) established an amplifier rating system in which the device is tested with both channels driven throughout its advertised frequency range, at no more than its published distortion level. The [[Electronic Industries Association]] (EIA) rating system, however, determines amplifier power by measuring a single channel at 1,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, with a 1% distortion level—1% clipping. Using the EIA method rates an amplifier 10 to 20% higher than the FTC method.&lt;ref name=Quilter/&gt;

=== Photovoltaic modules ===
{{Main|Watt peak}}

The nominal power of a photovoltaic module is determined by measuring current and voltage while varying resistance under defined illumination.  The conditions are specified in standards such as IEC 61215, IEC 61646 and UL 1703; specifically the light intensity is  1000&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a spectrum similar to sunlight hitting the earth's surface at latitude 35°&amp;nbsp;N in the summer ([[airmass]]&amp;nbsp;1.5) and temperature of the cells at 25&amp;nbsp;°C.  The power is measured while varying the resistive load on the module between open and closed circuit.

The maximum power measured is the nominal power of the module in Watts. Colloquially, this is also written as "W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;"; this format is colloquial as it is outside the standard by adding suffixes to [[International System of Units|standardized units]].  The nominal power divided by the light power that falls on the module (area x 1000&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is the ''efficiency''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2948">The '''Radio Research Laboratory (RRL)''', located on the campus of [[Harvard University]], was an 800-person secret research laboratory during [[World War II]]. Under the U.S. [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD), it was a spinoff of the [[Radiation Laboratory]] (Rad Lab) at MIT, and set up to develop [[electronic countermeasures]] to enemy radars and communications, as well as [[electronic counter-countermeasures]] (ECCM) to circumvent enemy ECM. The RRL was directed by [[Frederick E. Terman]] and operated between 1941 and 1945.

The RRL was engaged in both analysis and hardware development. They made significant contributions to the basic understanding of methods, theories, and circuits at [[VHF|very-high]] and [[UHF|ultra-high frequencies]] for radio systems, particularly in signals intelligence gear and statistical communications techniques. However, unlike the Rad Lab, the RRL never released significant details on its accomplishments; ECM and ECCM have always been closely guarded secrets by all nations.

The RRL conducted considerable work on [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]], light-weight aluminum strips dropped in clouds from aircraft to confuse enemy radars. [[Fred L. Whipple]], an astronomer, made detailed analytical studies of this and devised a formula giving [[radar cross-section]] at a given wavelength per kilogram of chaff.

An example of RRL hardware development was Tuba (aka 'Project Tuba'), a giant ECM system generating continuous 80-kW signals in the range of 300-600&amp;nbsp;MHz to jam German [[Lichtenstein radar]]s. The power tube (called Resnatron) for Tuba was developed at the RRL by David H. Shone and Lauritsen C. Marshall. Tuba used a [[horn antenna]] built of mesh wire 150 feet long and driven through 22- by 6- inch [[waveguides]], possibly the largest ever built. Tuba was placed in operation in mid-1944 on the south coast of England. The radiated energy was such that it lighted fluorescent bulbs a mile away and jammed radars throughout Europe.

The RRL staff did document some of the general theory that they developed. After the war, this was released in a two-volume publication ''Very High-Frequency Techniques'', edited by Herbert J. Reich (McGraw-Hill, 1947).

{{Acids and bases}}
The '''self-ionization of water''' (also '''autoionization of water''', and '''autodissociation of water''') is an [[ionization]] reaction in [[properties of water|pure water]] or in an [[aqueous solution]], in which a water molecule, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, [[deprotonation|deprotonates]] (loses the nucleus of one of its hydrogen atoms) to become a [[hydroxide]] ion, OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen nucleus, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], immediately [[protonation|protonates]] another water molecule to form [[hydronium]], H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. It is an example of [[autoprotolysis]], and exemplifies the [[amphoterism|amphoteric]] nature of water.

==Equilibrium constant==
[[File:Autoionizacion-agua.gif|200px|right|thumb]][[Ultrapure water|Chemically pure water]] has an [[electrical]] [[conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] of 0.055&amp;nbsp;&amp;micro;[[Siemens (unit)|S]]/cm. According to the theories of [[Svante Arrhenius]], this must be [[ionic conductor|due to the presence of ions]]. The ions are produced by the self-ionization reaction
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
This equilibrium applies to pure water and any aqueous solution.

Expressed with [[Thermodynamic activity|chemical activities]] {{mvar|a}}, instead of concentrations, the thermodynamic [[equilibrium constant]] for the water ionization reaction is:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{\rm eq} = \frac{a_{\rm{H_3O^+}} \cdot a_{\rm{OH^-}}}{a_{\rm{H_2O}}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

which is numerically equal to the more traditional thermodynamic equilibrium constant written as:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{\rm eq} = \frac{a_{\rm{H^+}} \cdot a_{\rm{OH^-}}}{a_{\rm{H_2O}}}&lt;/math&gt;

under the assumption that the sum of the chemical potentials of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is formally equal to twice the chemical potential of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at the same temperature and pressure.&lt;ref name="rel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapws.org/relguide/Ionization.pdf |title=Release on the Ionization Constant of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O |publisher=The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam |location=[[Lucerne]]|date=August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because most acid–base solutions are typically very dilute, the activity of water is generally approximated as being equal to unity, which allows the ionic product of water to be expressed as:&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=A00532|title=autoprotolysis constant}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K_{\rm eq} \approx a_{\rm{H_3O^+}} \cdot a_{\rm{OH^-}} &lt;/math&gt;

In dilute aqueous solutions, the activities of the solute particles are approximately equal to their concentrations. Thus, the ''ionization constant'', ''dissociation constant'', ''self-ionization constant'', or ''ionic product'' of water, symbolized by ''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;, may be given by:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{\rm w}=[{\rm{H_3O^+}}][{\rm{OH^-}}] &lt;/math&gt;
where [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] is the [[molarity]] (≈[[molar concentration]])&lt;ref name="Stumm"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Werner |last1=Stumm |first2=James |last2=Morgan |title=Aquatic Chemistry.  Chemical Equilibria and Rates in Natural Waters |edition=3rd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1996 |isbn=9780471511847}}&lt;/ref&gt; of hydrogen or [[hydronium ion]], and [OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] is the concentration of [[hydroxide]] ion. When the equilibrium constant is written as a product of concentrations (as opposed to activities) it is necessary to make corrections to the value of &lt;math&gt;K_{\rm w}&lt;/math&gt; depending on [[ionic strength]] and other factors (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harned|first1=H. S. |last2=Owen, |first2=B. B. |title=The Physical Chemistry of Electrolytic Solutions|edition=3rd|year=1958|publisher=Reinhold|location=New York|pages=635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 25&amp;nbsp;°C and zero ionic strength, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to {{val|1.0|e=-14}}. Note that as with all equilibrium constants, the result is dimensionless because the concentration is in fact a concentration relative to the [[standard state]], which for H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are both defined to be 1 molal (or molar). For most practical purposes, the molal and molar concentrations are equal near the ambient temperature and pressure. The molal concentration scale results in concentration values which account for density changes with temperature or pressure changes; therefore, it is the scale used in precise or nonambient applications, e.g., for [[seawater]],&lt;ref name="Stumm"/&gt; or at elevated temperatures, like those in thermal power plants.

We can also define p''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; −log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; (which is approximately 14 at 25&amp;nbsp;°C). This is analogous to the notations pH and p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; for an [[acid dissociation constant]], where the symbol p denotes a [[cologarithm]]. The logarithmic form of the equilibrium constant equation is p''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;pH&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;pOH.

The dependence of the water ionization on temperature and pressure has been investigated thoroughly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iapws.org/ International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS)]&lt;/ref&gt; The value of p''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; decreases as temperature increases from the melting point of ice to a minimum at c.&amp;nbsp;250&amp;nbsp;°C, after which it increases up to the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] of water c.&amp;nbsp;374&amp;nbsp;°C. It decreases with increasing pressure.

With [[electrolyte]] solutions, the value of p''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is dependent on [[ionic strength]] of the electrolyte. Values for [[sodium chloride]] are typical for a 1:1 electrolyte. With 1:2 electrolytes, MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, p''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; decreases with increasing ionic strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harned|first1=H. S. |last2=Owen, |first2=B.

The value of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is usually of interest in the [[liquid phase]]. Example values for [[superheated steam]] (gas) and [[supercritical water]] fluid are given in the table.

==Isotope effects==
[[Heavy water]], D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, self-ionizes less than normal water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O;
:D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OD&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
This is attributed to oxygen forming a slightly stronger bond to [[deuterium]] because the larger mass of deuterium results in a lower [[zero-point energy]], a quantum mechanical effect analogous to the [[kinetic isotope effect]].

Expressed with activities ''a'', instead of concentrations, the thermodynamic equilibrium constant for the heavy water ionization reaction is:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{\rm eq} = \frac{a_{\rm{D_3O^+}} \cdot a_{\rm{OD^-}}}{a_{\rm{D_2O}}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the activity of the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to be 1, and assuming that the activities of the D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OD&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are closely approximated by their concentrations
:&lt;math&gt;K_{\rm w}=[{\rm{D_3O^+}}][{\rm{OD^-}}] &lt;/math&gt;
The following table compares the values of p''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name=crc&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Lide|editor-first= D.

===Ionization equilibria in water–heavy water mixtures===
In water–heavy water mixtures equilibria several species are involved: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, HDO, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, HD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, HO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, DO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Mechanism==
The [[reaction rate|rate of reaction]] for the ionization reaction
:2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
depends on the [[activation energy]], Δ''E''&lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt;. According to the [[Boltzmann distribution]] the proportion of water molecules that have sufficient energy, due to thermal population, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N}{N_0} = e^{-\frac{\Delta E^\ddagger}{kT}}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. Thus some dissociation can occur because sufficient thermal energy is available. The following sequence of events has been proposed on the basis of [[electric field]] fluctuations in liquid water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Geissler|first1= P. L.|last2= Dellago|first2= C.|last3=Chandler|first3= D.|last4=Hutter|first4= J.|last5=Parrinello|first5= M. |year = 2001 |title = Autoionization in liquid water |journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume = 291 |pages = 2121–2124 |doi = 10.1126/science.1056991 |pmid = 11251111 |issue = 5511|bibcode = 2001Sci...291.2121G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Random fluctuations in molecular motions occasionally (about once every 10 hours per water molecule&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Eigen|first1= M. |last2=De Maeyer|first2= L. |year = 1955|trans-title=Investigations on the kinetics of neutralization I |title = Untersuchungen über die Kinetik der Neutralisation I |journal = Z. Elektrochem. |volume = 59 |pages = 986}}&lt;/ref&gt;) produce an electric field strong enough to break an oxygen–hydrogen [[covalent bond|bond]], resulting in a hydroxide (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and hydronium ion (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;); the hydrogen nucleus of the hydronium ion travels along water molecules by the [[Grotthuss mechanism]] and a change in the [[hydrogen bond]] network in the solvent isolates the two ions, which are stabilized by solvation. Within 1&amp;nbsp;[[picosecond]], however, a second reorganization of the hydrogen bond network allows rapid proton transfer down the electric potential difference and subsequent recombination of the ions. This timescale is consistent with the time it takes for hydrogen bonds to reorientate themselves in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stillinger|first= F. H. |year = 1975 |journal = Adv. Chem. Phys. |volume = 31 |pages = 1 |doi = 10.1002/9780470143834.ch1 |title = Theory and Molecular Models for Water}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rapaport|first= D. C. |year = 1983 |journal = [[Mol.

The inverse recombination reaction
:H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
is among the fastest chemical reactions known, with a [[reaction rate constant]] of {{val|1.3|e=11|u=M&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} at room temperature. Such a rapid rate is characteristic of a [[diffusion-controlled reaction]], in which the rate is limited by the speed of molecular [[diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tinoco|first1= I.|last2= Sauer |first2=K. |last3=Wang |first3=J. C. |title=Physical Chemistry: Principles and Applications in Biological Sciences|edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |date=1995| page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with the neutral point of water==
Water molecules dissociate into equal amounts of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, so their concentrations are equal to {{val|1.00|e=-7|u=mol&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}} at 25&amp;nbsp;°C. A solution in which the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations equal each other is considered a '''neutral''' solution. In general, the pH of the neutral point is numerically equal to {{sfrac|2}}p''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;.

Pure water is neutral, but most water samples contain impurities. If an impurity is an [[acid]] or [[base (chemistry)|base]], this will affect the concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion. Water samples that are exposed to air will absorb some acidic [[carbon dioxide]] to form carbonic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and the concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; will increase due to the reaction H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O = HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The concentration of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; will decrease in such a way that the product [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;][OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] remains constant for fixed temperature and pressure. Thus these water samples will be slightly acidic.  If a pH of exactly 7.0 is required, it must be maintained with an appropriate [[buffer solution]].

The '''temperate rainforests of the Russian Far East''' are found within the Russian states of [[Primorsky Krai]] and Khabarovski Krai and contains the [[Sikhote-Alin]] mountain range. Found within the [[Russian Federation]], this area is one of the most productive and diverse forests in the world and also contains one of the highest [[endangered species]] densities on Earth.&lt;ref name=Cushman2000&gt;Cushman, S. A., &amp; Wallin, D. O. (2000). Rates and patterns of landscape change in the Central Sikhote-alin Mountains, Russian Far East. Landscape Ecology, 15(7), 643-659&lt;/ref&gt; While most [[temperate rainforest]]s around the world have retained only a fraction of their historical range, these forests maintain the majority of their former range and almost all of their historical [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Cushman2000 /&gt; The region is also notable for having what has become the last remaining large tract of viable habitat for the critically endangered [[Amur tiger]] and [[Amur leopard]].

==History==
[[File:Maximovka valley.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A|Maximovka valley]]The Russian Federation contains one sixth of the world’s land mass and around half of the country’s territory is what could be considered continuous [[wilderness]], with large expanses of [[boreal forests]] providing relatively untouched habitat for an extremely wide diversity of species. The temperate rainforests are located at the intersection of the [[Pacific tectonic plate]] and the [[Eurasian continent]]’s plate in far southeastern Russia, forming an area with a unique set of characteristics seen no where else in the world.&lt;ref name=DellaSala2011&gt;DellaSala D. 2011. Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World. Island Press&lt;/ref&gt; During the last [[glacial maximum]], the area was not glaciated, allowing for the development of a complex [[ecosystem]] containing species with origins in Siberia’s boreal forest and Manchuria’s subtropical forests.&lt;ref name=DellaSala2011 /&gt; Historically these forests ranged from the southeastern Pacific coast of Russia, [[North Korea]], and into northern [[China]], however large amounts of human development (in China especially) has limited the forest to its current range in the Russian Far East.&lt;ref name=DellaSala2011 /&gt; In 2001, [[UNESCO]] recognized a 1.5 million hectare area of forest in the central part of the Sikhote-Alin mountains as a [[World Heritage Site]] in Russia, citing the area as one of the most unique and valuable areas of intact forest in the world &lt;ref&gt;Central Sikhote-Alin. (n.d.). Retrieved November 22, 2014, from http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/766&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
These forests are found dispersed throughout the Sikhote-Alin mountain range, which extend over 1000 km along the west coast of the [[Sea of Japan]]. The mountains have a maximum height of 1850 m, while the average elevation within the range is around 1000 m.&lt;ref name=Cushman2000 /&gt; The major rivers include the [[Ussuri]], which acts as the western border with China and empties into the [[Amur river]], which in turn flows northeast to empties into the Sea of Okhotsk. The [[Bikin River|Bikin]] and [[Iman River|Iman]] rivers act as tributaries to the Ussuri, flowing west from the Sikhote-Alin mountain range. [[File:Якут-гора.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=A|Sikhote-Alin mountain range in winter]]

==Climate==
Known as the "Ussuri taiga," this region of Russia has long, cold winters and fairly mild summers to go along with a mean [[precipitation]] of 800–1000&amp;nbsp;mm per year.&lt;ref name=DellaSala2011 /&gt; During the summer and fall, a [[monsoonal]] influence brings [[tropical storms]] and [[typhoons]] coming from the southeast, resulting in substantial rainfall.&lt;ref name=DellaSala2011 /&gt; [[Fog]] occurs as a result of difference in temperatures between the continent and the ocean, resulting in more moderate temperatures, higher humidities; helping to prevent substantial water loss from occurring due to [[evapotranspiration]].&lt;ref name=DellaSala2011 /&gt; Continental winds coming in from Siberia bring cooler, dry air during winter, resulting in lighter precipitation (30–50&amp;nbsp;cm of snow).&lt;ref name=DellaSala2011 /&gt; Winters can be long and bitterly cold with January mean temperatures ranging from -15 to -20&amp;nbsp;°C and snow covering the forest floor from October to April.&lt;ref name=Kobayashi&gt;Kobayashi, M. A. K. O. T. O., NEMILOSTIV, Y. P., ZYRYANOVA, O. A., KAJIMOTO, T., MATSUURA, Y., YOSHIDA, T., ... &amp; KOIKE, T. (2007). Regeneration after Forest Fires in mixed Conifer Broad-leaved Forests of the Amur Region in Far Eastern Russia: the Relationship between Species Specific Traits Against Fire and Recent Fire Regimes. Eurasian Journal of Forest Research, 10(1), 51-58,&lt;/ref&gt; The driest parts of the year are from April to June and September to October, which also happen to coincide with the greatest threat of [[forest fire]].&lt;ref name=DellaSala2011 /&gt;

==Species==
The forests fall in the transition zone between two [[biomes]]: the southern Asian [[hardwood forest]] and the northern [[coniferous forest]].&lt;ref name=Cushman2002&gt;Cushman, S. A., &amp; Wallin, D. O. (2002). Separating the effects of environmental, spatial and disturbance factors on forest community structure in the Russian Far East. Forest Ecology and Management, 168(1), 201-215&lt;/ref&gt; There have been around 2500 species of vascular plants and 300 vertebrate species recorded in Primorsky Krai.&lt;ref name=Cushman2002 /&gt;

[[File:Larix gmelinii0.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=A|A Gmelin larch (''Larix gmelini'') stand in the Russian Far East]]

The forest is a mix of [[broadleaf]] and [[conifer]], with the forest type becoming more conifer dominated at higher elevations and more broad-leaf-conifer mixed at the lower elevations and within valleys. The most common species include the [[Korean pine]] (''Pinus koraiensis'') and needle fir (''Abies holophylla'') at the lowest elevations and coastlines. [[Jezo spruce]] (''Picea jezoensis'') and Manchurian fir (''Abies nephrolepis'') are common species to be found from 700–1400 meters.&lt;ref name="DellaSala2011"/&gt; Other tree species include [[Mongolian oak]] (''Quercus mongolica''), [[Betula pendula|white birch]] (''Betula platyphylla''), [[Scots pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris''), [[Populus tremula|trembling aspen]] (''Populus tremula''), Dahurian birch (''Betula davurica''), and Gmelin larch (''Larix gemlinii''), a deciduous evergreen tree common throughout, but dominant in the northern reaches of the forest&lt;ref name=Cushman2002 /&gt;
The Amur region of Russia holds the last remaining habitats of the critically endangered Amur tiger, Amur leopard, and Manchurian sika deer. It has been estimated that there are less the 600 tigers.&lt;ref name=Carroll2006&gt;Carroll, C., &amp; Miquelle, D. G. (2006).

Journal of Applied Ecology, 43(6), 1056-1068&lt;/ref&gt; and around 40 leopards left in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;Uphyrkina, O., Miquelle, D., Quigley, H., Driscoll, C., &amp; O'Brien, S. J. (2002). Conservation genetics of the Far Eastern leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis). Journal of Heredity, 93(5), 303-311&lt;/ref&gt; The area also contains populations of [[Asiatic black bears]] and Kamchatka brown bears, as the Russian Far East is the only place in the world where tigers, brown bears, and leopards coexist. This region also happens to be some of the last of habitat of the Blakiston’s fish owl ([[Bubo blakistoni]]); along with being the world’s largest owl, it is unique in the way that it eats fish (primarily [[Masu salmon]]) and relies on [[old growth forests]] along river banks to feed, nest, and breed.&lt;ref&gt;WCS Study: Huge Trees Help Huge Salmon-Eating Owl. (2013, August 15). Retrieved November 22, 2014, from http://www.wcs.org/press/press-releases/rare-blakiston-fish-owls.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Common ungulates include [[red deer]], [[roe deer]], [[wild boar]], Manchurian moose, and [[musk deer]].

==Forest structure and disturbances==
Fire and [[logging]] constitute the primary disturbances in this area, both of which are occurring at an increasing frequency.&lt;ref name=Kobayashi /&gt; Illegal logging practices, along with a political climate more favorable to multinational logging corporations has drastically increased the amount of timber taken per year.&lt;ref name=Cushman2002 /&gt; The occurrence of Korean pine in dominant forests has been declining as more common and more intense wildfires start to take their toll on the species, limiting its ability to recover and changing areas that were once dominated by old growth Korean pine to Mongolian oak and birch forests.&lt;ref name=Cushman2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carroll2006 /&gt; Above 700–800 meters in altitude, the forest type transitions from broadleaf to coniferous, dominated by Jezo spruce and Manchurian fir. The further to the north, the altitudinal gradient decreases with the increase in latitude, resulting in coniferous forests at sea level at 47° N latitude.&lt;ref name=Carroll2006 /&gt;

==Conservation==
Under the USSR control, [[conservation biology|conservation]] strategies focused on the creation and a network of strictly protected nature reserves, called [[zapovednik]] and partially protected wildlife refuges, called [[zakaznik]].&lt;ref name=Carroll2006 /&gt; These conservation strategies were largely successful and well maintained, as 85 zapovedniks and 26 national parks remained within Russian control after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991. Following the break up, a period of economic hardship has ensued in Russia, resulting in conservation funding cuts and increases in illegal logging and poaching, casting serious doubt on the viabilities of the protected areas and the many rare and [[endemic]] species that they contain.&lt;ref name=Dinerstein&gt;Dinerstein, E., Krever, V., Olson, D. M., &amp; Williams, L. (1994). An emergency strategy to rescue Russia's biological diversity. Conservation Biology, 934-939&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siberian tiger hanging at bar.jpg|thumb|400px|alt=A|Amur (Siberian) tiger]]

Conservation policies have been falling from federal control down to a regional level, which creates funding and enforcement challenges, but also allows for a more [[grass-roots]], bottom up approach to conservation, which despite the challenges has seen some success. Much of the recent funding for conservation studies and implementation of legislation comes from donors and organizations in the United States, where investing in conserving the biodiversity in the Russian Far East is seen as a good economic investment.&lt;ref name=Dinerstein /&gt; At a species level, Korean pine is a highly valued type of [[timber]], and although the logging of the species is restricted, [[illegal logging]] practices thrive due to a lack of enforcement.&lt;ref name=Dinerstein /&gt; It should be noted that Korean pine forests also receive the most interest when it comes to conservationists, as they have been found to have the highest densities of tigers and their prey. Because of this, it appears that the longevity of the temperate rain forests in the Russian Far East will most likely depend on the success of the habitat conservation efforts for the endangered species found there, particularly those for the Amur tiger.&lt;ref name=Dinerstein /&gt;

C. Lomax, "The Johnson's Head"|page=351|accessdate=30 May 2018|location=Lichfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born at [[Hatford]], the son of Francis Joseph Pearce, a clergyman who died when he was aged two, and his wife Mary Ann Rickards. He then moved to be with her, in [[Leicestershire]].&lt;ref name="AlOx"&gt;[[s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Pearce, Thomas (4)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C19"&gt;Chandler, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Pearce matriculated at [[Lincoln College, Oxford]] in June 1838, as did his elder brother Francis Joseph at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]]. The family moved to Oxford at this period.&lt;ref name="AlOx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Pearce, Francis Joseph (2)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas graduated B.A. in 1843, and M.A. in 1849.&lt;ref name="AlOx"/&gt;

Ordained in the [[Church of England]] in 1845, Pearce then held a number of curacies in southern England. He was in 1845 at [[Goldenhill]]; in 1847 at [[Highcliffe]]; in 1851 at [[Waterperry]]; and in 1852 in [[Sparsholt, Oxfordshire|Sparsholt]], which was at that time in Berkshire.&lt;ref name="C22"&gt;Chandler, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearce became vicar of [[Morden, Dorset]] in 1853. He was also rector of [[Charborough]] from 1871. He died on 24 September 1885.&lt;ref name="AlOx"/&gt; His interests including breeding champion [[setter]]s, shooting [[snipe]], and collecting birds.&lt;ref name="C19"/&gt;

'''Titanowodginite''' is a [[mineral]] with the [[chemical formula]] [[manganese|Mn]]Ti[[tantalum|Ta]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. Titanowodginite has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 5.5 and a [[vitreous lustre|vitreous]] [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]]. It is an iridescent dark brown to black crystal that commonly forms in a matrix of [[smoky quartz]] or white [[beryl]] in a complex zoned [[pegmatite]].&lt;ref name=mindat&gt;http://www.mindat.org/min-3979.html Mindat&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Webmin&gt;http://www.webmineral.com/data/Titanowodginite.shtml Webmineral&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/hom/titanowodginite.pdf Handbook of Mineralogy&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first described in 1992 for an occurrence in the [[Tanco Mine]] located in southern [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]].  It was named because it is a [[titanium]] bearing member of the [[wodginite]] group.&lt;ref name=mindat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;

'''Water sky''' is a phenomenon that is closely related to [[ice blink]]. It forms in regions with large areas of ice and low-lying clouds and so is limited mostly to the extreme northern and southern sections of earth, in [[Antarctica]] and in the [[Arctic]].

When light hits the blue oceans or seas, some of it bounces back and enables the observer to physically see the water. However, some of the light also is reflected back up on to the bottoms of low-lying clouds and causes a dark spot to appear underneath some clouds. These clouds may be visible when the seas are not and can show alert and knowledgeable travelers the general direction of water. The dark clouds over open water have long been used by polar explorers and scientists to navigate in sea ice. For example, Arctic explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and his assistant [[Hjalmar Johansen]] used the phenomenon to find lanes of water in [[Nansen's Fram expedition|their failed expedition]] to the [[North Pole]] as did [[Bernacchi]] and Sir [[Douglas Mawson]] in the Antarctica.

'''William M. Napier''' or '''Bill Napier''' (born 29 June 1940 in [[Perth, Scotland]]) is the author of five [[high tech]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] novels and a number of nonfiction science books.

==Career==

He received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in 1963 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1966, both from the [[University of Glasgow]].

Napier is a professional astronomer who has worked at the [[Royal Observatory, Edinburgh|Royal Observatory in Edinburgh]], the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Armagh Observatory]]. He is currently an honorary professor of [[Astrobiology]] in the Center for Astrobiology at [[Cardiff University]], which describes him as "a leading figure in the dynamics and physics of comets, and a pioneer of the modern versions of [[catastrophism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cardiff Center for Astrobiology, Staff|url=http://cardiffcentreforastrobiology.com|website=cardiffcentreforastrobiology.com|publisher=Cardiff Center for Astrobiology|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   And honorary professor at the Buckingham Centre for Astrobiology, [[University of Buckingham]], which describes him as, "a pioneer of modern studies of the impact hazard due to asteroids and comets," and also as having, "carried out an investigation of long-running claims of anomalous QSO/galaxy associations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor William M. Napier|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/directory/professor-william-m-napier/|website=www.buckingham.ac.uk|publisher=[[University of Buckingham]]|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research work focuses on [[comet]]s and [[cosmology]]. The result of his collaboration with [[Victor Clube]] and others on the role of giant comets in Earth history is known as "[[coherent catastrophism]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[David J. Asher|Asher, D. J.]], S.

According to Napier, 13,000 years ago the earth was affected by a major, rapid cooling event that caused the extinction of a large number of species and a major disruption of paleoindian cultures.  Previously thought to have been caused by an enormous asteroid crashing into the planet, Professor presented evidence that the cooling even was caused collision with "a dense trail of material from a large disintegrating comet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Was a giant comet responsible for a North American catastrophe in 11,000 BC?|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100401101527.htm|accessdate=5 November 2014|publisher=[[Science Daily]]|date=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roach|first1=John|title=Comet "Shower" Killed Ice Age Mammals?|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/04/100407-ice-age-extinction-comet-meteor-shower/|accessdate=5 November 2014|publisher=National Geographic|date=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hecht|first1=John|title=Did a comet swarm strike America 13,000 years ago?|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2010/04/did-a-comet-swarm-strike-ameri.html|accessdate=5 November 2014|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|date=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenniskens|first1=Petrus Matheus Marie|title=Meteor Showers and Their Parent Comets|date=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0521853494|page=455|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpajMuyXG8AC&amp;pg=PA455&amp;dq=clube+napier+%22cosmic+winter%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=haZaVKuoNcf7sATZ34LICA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=clube%20napier%20%22cosmic%20winter%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1302">The '''World Administrative Radio Conference''' (WARC) was a technical conference of the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) where delegates from member nations of the ITU met to revise or amend the entire international [[Radio Regulations]] pertaining to all telecommunication services throughout the world. The conference was held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], with preparatory conferences held in [[Panama City, Panama]].

In 1992 at an ''Additional Plenipotentiary Conference'' in Geneva the ITU was restructured and as a result from 1993 the conference became known as the [[World Radiocommunication Conference]] or WRC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/aboutitu/overview/history.html ITU.int]&lt;/ref&gt;
